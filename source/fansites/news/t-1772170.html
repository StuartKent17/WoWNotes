Darkmoon Faire Races<br />
The Darkmoon Faire is back again, bringing us yet another race, in addition to the other Patch 6.1 changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4748-Darkmoon-Faire-Race-and-Changes-Archaeology-Fix-Blue-Tweets-Method-Interview-DLC). The Wanderluster is the new mount this time around, with an additional achievement: Darkmoon Like the Wind (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9819-darkmoon-like-the-wind).<br />
<br />
The first race uses the smaller course, allowing you to earn Wanderluster: Gold (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9792-wanderluster-gold) and the Attraction Sign (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122126-attraction-sign). <br />
<br />
The second race uses the big course, allowing you to earn Big Wanderluster: Gold (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9811-big-wanderluster-gold) and the Darkmoon Gazer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122121-darkmoon-gazer). The Gazer is not a toy, so it will take up an additional inventory slot. <br />
<br />
The Wanderluster mount jumps to hazards (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/153397-jump-to-hazard) rather than gates, allowing you to jump to the wires and be immune for 4 seconds. It has the old ability that allows you to pull powerups to you. It also has a new ability (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/152875-danger-zone) that gives you a shield that protects you from the mini-zeppelins. If they hit you while the shield is up, you get a speed boost, starting at 100 and stacking up to 150.<br />
<br />
The trick this month is to use the shield or other speed boosts at the start of the course to get a faster start. This can be accomplished by starting a race, getting your speed boost, running back, abandoning the quest, and starting again. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Pets and Pet Battles<br />
I'm still waiting to breed my battle pets. It would give the feature so much more to enjoy.<br />
When you start to flesh out the concept, it gets weird. Terrible Turnip/Alliance Balloon fanfic weird. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/592127467675987968))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Working on a decades-spanning project, I feel that this is applicable. Thoughts? https://t.co/AUdE0mNmGs (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/592948878988574720))<br />
Maybe do the spectacle creep in steps, like the vid, from 5 person to whole galaxy, WOAH there, couldn't they maybe save a town?<br />
Design Challenge: what's happening to that town? If it's on fire, -5 points (Simpsons, er, WoD did it). (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/592953118557491200))<br />
WoD was hurt by this,and again in general I think yall try too hard<br />
I'm gonna spurt off a new thread with more talking space, what would you like to see less of/more of? Open discussion. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/592960505515376640))<br />
<br />
is, we survived being put on fire and our minds flayed and armor broken but our characters head could be crushed under a kodo<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/ssdgraph.gif) are trending slightly downward again over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
New GPUs from AMD may be coming in the second half of this year, but no official announcements have been made. <br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Heroes of the Storm had a college tournament (https://heroesofthedorm.com/news/students-battle-for-free-college-tuition-in-blizzards-heroes-of-the-dorm-tournament/), rewarding tuition money, computers, and more. The finals were broadcast on ESPN2, upsetting some people (http://www.sbnation.com/2015/4/28/8506273/colin-cowherd-espn-esports-heroes-of-the-dorm) and exciting others. Ratings weren't high compared to other things on TV, but lots of people watched compared to many eSports tournaments! <br />
<br />
<br />
96K total viewers for Heroes Of The Dorm live eSports tourney on ESPN 2 (Total day avg viewership = 211K)<br />
96K = the avg total viewers for Heroes during its timeslot. 211K = the avg total day viewers for ESPN 2 as a network<br />
Heroes was the 3rd-least watched program that day on ESPN2. Last Sunday's same timeslot did 313K (Bo 30for30 repeat) (carletoncurtis (https://twitter.com/carletoncurtis/status/593159309778784256))<br />
Only ESPN2 shows that did worse than &quot;Heroes of the Dorm&quot; on Sun: a 6am re-air of Grizzlies-Blazers (91K homes) and ESPNFC at 12:30am (48K). (Ourand_SBJ (https://twitter.com/Ourand_SBJ/status/593110495189676032))<br />

It was harder than the previous months, but not amazingly awful. I would imagine if I tried I could have done it in 10. Making that annoying jump on the cliff for the big race along with the timings of the powerups, now that is annoying.</div></div><hr />

Especially with that crybaby talk radio guy saying he'd quit if he'd have to cover games (spoilers bro, you already do). May as well not bother having eSports on any ESPN media network cause... well, let's be honest, can you even imagine AM/FM talk radio even existing as a sustainable business model 20 years from now? I don't know anyone who actually tunes into ESPN's radio stations that's below the age of 60. It's something that's literally going to vanish with baby boomers' generation. The guy will probably be forced to retire or find a new line of work right when his core audience is begins to hit the die off point in 10 years. Cable television as it's been for the last 25 years will probably cease to be not long after that.</div></div><hr />

I would save up and go with Dolphin, with the motherboard and CPU from Narwhal for the best bang for your buck. Having that extra CPU would be helpful for WoW. If you are in the US, Frys has that CPU for $200 in store this week or Microcenter has a CPU/motherboard combo for a good price (in store). I'm not sure how it will work out after taxes and shipping, but people will buy and ship stuff (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcproxy) for you.<br />
<br />
You might be able to save another ~$50-100+ by buying things that are on sale as well.</div></div><hr />

Eye of Kilrogg? You mean that spell that almost no Warlock actually has on their spell bar anymore since there is almost zero need for it, and the only time we actually summon it is when we are bored and just want to goof off?<br />

<br />
Well we can use it to place down a Summoning Circle at least, which I think is decent for PvP sometimes. I wish the game would throw some PvE bosses / world mechanics that actually let us benefit from using the Eye. Currently the only thing it is really useful for PvE-wise (and it is VERY useful) is one point inside the Black Temple for the Green Fire quest line. The glyphed Eye of Kilrogg makes one of the rooms so much easier (you need to follow a narrow winding pathway lined with things that are really harmful. Eye of Kilrogg can just go right through without damage, and you can place a Circle down further down the path).<br />
<br />
It was also used on release to get to treasures much easier, before they took away the the glyphed Eye's ability to fly in Draenor. You could scale mountains with a glyphed eye.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Blizzard could do something that let warlock eyes be useful. Maybe some dungeons/raids could be made safer if, for instance, a rogue or warlock could be used to scout far ahead of the group so they can avoid some very difficult mobs or environmental hazards?<br />
<br />
Heck, maybe there could be a maze-like room with dangerous dead ends that a warlock, rogue or someone that has scouting abilities (would love Eyes of the Beast back for this) could be used to help make navigating the maze much safer.</div></div><hr />

Eye of Arachnida (http://www.wowhead.com/item=13508/eye-of-arachnida) drops in Stratholme off Nerub'enkan and has since vanilla. So no sense complaining about it.

As for the races myself, although I've managed to get them after a LOT of tries, they're frustrating more than fun. One wrong turn, jump, accidental run into a tree, stun, lag spike, deviation from the perfect route, or even a finger spasm or hand bump and you can kiss the gold achievement goodbye. I keep getting 12 tolls on the real race and I'm usually 1-3 off on the real big race. Don't know how many times I get the red flag in the real race and then take the jump power-up only to end up going in a direction AWAY from where I wanted to go. Then I'm stuck swimming back to shore because my water walking buff ran out. Or in the real big race when you jump up the cliff at the beginning and I mistime the jump to get to the top so I have to wait until one of my vehicle's abilities are off cooldown so I can get up the rest of the cliff. Ace tonk commander made me almost throw my computer out the window. I FINALLY got it yesterday. The one to get Hoggs in 6.2 I can see frustrating me to no end, too. Only one I found easy was the ring toss.<br />
<br />
While I do find a lot of comments on youtube, etc say to use a DK or paladin for their riding speed buff, that really shouldn't be the go to strategy. ALL classes should be viable and have the same amount of wiggle room in error. It's not fair that the races are tuned so tightly that two classes have an advantage (more wiggle room for error) over the others. I've done gold on a shaman for the first two racers but still working on the third. I'm considering changing my tactics and using my DK at this point. Perhaps Blizzard should adjust the time of the tolls and disable riding speed increase buffs to make the race more fair for everyone. But hey, when's Blizzard really been fair?</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately myself, and many others like myself I'm sure A) had no clue this was on or would have watched it and B) would love a place I can go for my e-everything including sports fix. Unfortunately such a place doesn't exist yet. G4 is caca now.</div></div><hr />

ALL classes should be viable and have the same amount of wiggle room in error. It's not fair that the races are tuned so tightly that two classes have an advantage (more wiggle room for error) over the others. I've done gold on a shaman for the first two racers but still working on the third. I'm considering changing my tactics and using my DK at this point. Perhaps Blizzard should adjust the time of the tolls and disable riding speed increase buffs to make the race more fair for everyone. But hey, when's Blizzard really been fair?<br />
<br />
Their advantage isn't considerable. I've done every race on a class without a natural speed boost, even the Springstrider on the long race without the multiplayer cheat.<br />
<br />
<br />
The short race is just aids. If you have lag above 150, it will take you a LOOOOOOONG time to get gold. Would appreciate if blizzard would take lag into consideration when designing the race. 0.1 milliseconds off, and you just wont get it.<br />
<br />
I've actually noticed the short race has more items than last month, and the same is likely true of the big race. There's at least three Blink items in places I know weren't there last month.<br />
<br />
Blizzard wasn't kidding that it would get easier to do over time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ludafrank</div><div class="date">2015-05-05, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watch ESPN pretty much all day everyday, I almost always have it on while on my laptop just to have something else to pay attention to, and I never saw a commercial for HotD. I knew it was going on already so I watched it but still, if they are going to show e-sports they should advertise it at least a little bit. Having that few of viewers will only show them that e-sports aren't really working out and thats a shame. E-sports are big enough that they deserve to be televised and ESPN not only has more than enough channels to show them as well as mainstream sports but they can also call themselves the worldwide leader in e-sports since they get a hard-on with such things i.e. xgames = worldwide leader in action sports. The idea of watching e-sports sounds pretty lame to me, honestly, but once I gave it a chance I really liked it and if ESPN would advertise even a little bit when they are showing them they could win over a lot of viewers that just want to see what its about. <br />
<br />
They had a CoD tourney at the last xgames that got very little fanfare and I believe they also had a DotA championship before that. Both of those would pull in a pretty big audience if they just advertised.</div></div><hr />

lol G4 missed a golden opportunity to make their channel actually relevant to gamers with eSports. Instead they push stupid shows that nobody gives a crap about and their ratings are awful as a result.</div></div><hr />

I think they are stupid and wish they would be phased out or put somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

G4s actually completely dead now, some providers cut them pretty fast, others kept them on the air like an extra year, was a slow slow death. Final segment was a throwback to the original pong marathon from way way back and the channels inception, it's on youtube somewhere. They also aired the very first episode of X-play before that<br />
<br />
Don't think Esquire Network, the channel that killed G4, is doing great in the ratings either, could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />
