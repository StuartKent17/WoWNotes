Patch 5.4 - Darkmoon Faire Updates<br />
The Darkmoon Faire is back today and with it comes Moonfang (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/71992-moonfang), a new boss. Moonfang has a low respawn time, can tag be tagged by anyone, and will give you an extra 10 tickets (http://www.wowdb.com/items/105891-moonfangs-pelt#related:starts) on your first kill. Be sure to enable the WoWDB addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/wowdb-profiler) to help us get drop rates faster!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
So you seem really set on balancing tank damage but ignore the huge healing output differences in 25m heroic content.<br />
Source? Meters are a terrible way to assess healer potency. They work reasonably well for assessing tank DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386142166596087809))<br />
<br />
k what's with the warlock hate after patch release? nerfing 1 class to keep others in check is lame. buff mage huntard instead<br />
We'd have to buff a lot of classes and then likely buff the encounters as well to compensate for all the higher damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385583221586419712))<br />
<br />
There's so much focus on getting singletarget dps within 1%, but AoE/cleave feels like there are 50% differences..<br />
I don't think ST at 1% differences and AE at 50% differences are true and they're certainly not goals. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496001605165058))<br />
Keep in mind AE varies enormously depending upon duration, number of targets and proximity of targets. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496147877318656))<br />
ST is more a function of ramp up time and duration (whether sustained or burst matters more on that fight). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496215434952704))<br />
<br />
Hundreds of constant minor tweaks erode class diversity. Ppl would complain less frequently if you changed less.<br />
Do you think that's true or do you think they would just feel ignored since long-standing problems would go untreated? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385141294852354048))<br />
<br />
I would like to see healing go back to making smart choices and acting upon them. I don't want the game to heal for me.<br />
We agree in general, but how do you solve something like e.g. Atonement or Binding Heal glyph? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384846145597366272))<br />
By making them poor. Any spell for which the game chooses the targets for you should lose to smart player decisions<br />
Yeah, we think that is a good direction. We'd just need to make sure each healer had a &quot;dumb (but smart!)&quot; alternative. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384852261165219840))<br />
I'm not sure casting PW:S on the whole raid or spamming Holy Light/Rejuv were &quot;smart player decisions&quot;.<br />
It's hard to imagine AE heals that aren't smart heals unless they are like HRain (area based) or PoH (goofy party based). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385140020727652352))<br />
<br />
&quot;...why play a non dot?&quot; why make a dot spec if multidotting is always going to hold back it's single target dmg?<br />
Class diversity? Why make a non dot spec if your ST damage is always going to hold back your AE? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385135323262361601))<br />
At least players no longer say &quot;I don't care about AE because that's just for trash.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385135402505359360))<br />
<br />
If a tooltip is starting to get complex, I think it means that ability has too many jobs to do &amp; needs rethinking.<br />
We agree. That is just one of the risk of having too many spells of the design &quot;X replaces Y but with Z extra effect.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384851844700188672))<br />
<br />
sorry meant that most players just want to feel their dps is competitive but not the hardcore min/max definition<br />
I used to think that, but I think today a lot of players look at highest possible DPS even though it barely affects them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384850764130045952))<br />
(And when I say &quot;a lot&quot; it still probably isn't that many total, but more than it used to be.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384850844266401792))<br />
<br />
The overall problem is you're not even trying to achieve class balance. When you do, then we can have a meaningful discussion.<br />
We aren't trying to have all classes tie in all situations, no. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384840135486865409))<br />

BrM nerf = fine, the way you doing it = terrible. You are nerfing our already &quot;bad&quot; 2p as well. Any compensation to our 2p?<br />
The alternative is to nerf monks and then buff WW damage, but that carries a lot more bug risk. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496416753184768))<br />
I think it's hard to justify Brewmaster damage being so much higher than other tanks though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385496504191811584))<br />
<br />
exactly what aspect of revival prior to the 30% nerf broke the game?<br />
The cast time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384849085154336768))<br />
<br />

What happened to &quot;take dmg done into calculation for healer balance&quot;? And agree about all smartheals, they need to be limited.<br />
Do you meant Atonement damage done? It's really fine and Atonement healing is fine too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385140187983925248))<br />
The deal IMO is that Disc can shift so effortlessly into that role whenever you don't need a lot of healing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385140294850576384))<br />

- In all fairness and honesty, PvE Warlocks probably wouldn't be hurt too terribly with another nerf or two. - A PvE Warlock<br />
We worry the Affliction nerf isn't large enough, but we'll see how it goes. We try and err on the side of not over-nerfing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385583423546351616))<br />
<br />
So are you gonna talk about the agony 15% stealth nerf? or is that going to be what must not be named?<br />
It's not intended as a stealth nerf. The hotfix notes just haven't caught up yet. Affliction DPS was still too high. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385495809401180160))<br />
Call it w.e you want. In most players eyes, it's a blatant nerf. Did you honestly think players wouldn't notice?<br />
If they didn't, they would when the hotfix notes went out for the day. Stealth nerfs serve no purpose; players will figure it out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385580921102954496))<br />
<br />
yet that becomes a basis for damage too high, I think youre over nerfing here.<br />
What current fight would you consider warlocks to be weak on? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385582857483063297))<br />

So warriors socket straight crit as arms or fury, yet you took away their static crit buff...why?<br />
The intent of group buffs is that individuals can make the group stronger, not that individuals can be very self sufficient. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386138542243446784))<br />
<br />
What about rage from damage taken? what was the reasoning for removing that?<br />
For tanks, it made offtanking rough. For PvP, it made not getting attacked rough. For PvE DPS it meant standing in fires. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385136625652490240))<br />
We tried to capture some of the feel with Berserker Stance, which isn't quite there yet, but is pretty close. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385136712365522944))<br />

Professions<br />
Do you —master of all UIs— think that the profession panel could display the breakdown of ingredients? #craftingnoodlecarts<br />
Could the profession UI suck less? Absolutely. What do you mean by breakdown specifically? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384846605209178112))<br />
<br />
Wondered if you've ever considered account-wide professions? With alts so prevalent is the 2 per char limit still useful?<br />
Would love to see more discussion on this topic from players. Alts are cool, but alts just to get around the prof limit bug me. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384839308781170688))<br />

<br />
It's the one-sided nature of the &quot;dependency&quot; that gets to me. And before people start barking &quot;Professions always require other professions to get by! That's just the way it is!&quot; First, that hasn't really been true since vanilla WoW, and second, it only affects a handful of professions now. If people want some &quot;grand scheme&quot; of interdependency where no profession can exist without another, then maybe they should start gunning for a situation in which that actually exists, instead of one where a scant few production professions unilaterally rely on OTHER production professions to make... anything. <br />
<br />
You want TRUE interdependency? Well, Engineers and blacksmiths relies on alchemists to make things now, right? Maybe Alchemists should rely on jewelcrafting to make all their flasks. Maybe scribes should require leatherworkers to make the vellum for their enchants. Maybe leatherworkers should go back to requiring limited-charge salt shakers made by engineers to produce high-end skins. Priests should need special enchanted spellthreads only craftable by enchanters, and jewelcrafters should need their tools to be crafted by blacksmiths. THAT'S &quot;interwoven profession design.&quot; Not &quot;Engineers and Blacksmiths can't make anything worthwhile without alchemists.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The professions system in general needs some major work, not just because of how it pays to have alts that exist only to handle professions but also with the fact that while leveling 90% of what you can craft is completely worthless. All of the low level mats and gear are artificial grinds and gating, and nothing more. Hell even some of the for instance level 85 BS recipes are junk compared to what you can already get via quests, so even that turns out to just be time wasters on the path to the real goal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, if players are considering it a better use of their time to level up an alt, grind up their profession and create everything themselves rather than engage in trade; then it would seem more likely that the games commerce portion needs to be reformatted rather than it's trade portion.<br />

I'm skeptical that they could actually make 2 profs per account, how would they determine?

Maybe make a further distinction between gathering and crafting professions, to avoid characters with 3 crafting professions and the superior bonuses. <br />
<br />
I don't really mind the system as it is, as I tend to want new flavors of gameplay every other week, but due to the heavy time investment in leveling each profession I usually find myself playing only a couple of characters most of the time. <br />
I'd really like to see changes in mat requirements for professions like Leatherworking by making it easier to obtain (especially vanilla) leathers. The price is usually through the roof on the AH and it's not easy to tell what leathers you'll get when skinning mobs, except in the later expansions. Getting medium leathers when you want heavy is a pain. And getting one leather per mob when you need at least 15 for one item makes the profession easily the most grindy of them all.</div></div><hr />

Thirded here. There really wasn't a correct way for me to answer that poll. Though I've always liked being a one person tradeskill shop in any game, so if I didn't have enough alts to manage it, I would make them. Though I DID change some of my alts' professions for this patch to (ab)use the daily cooldowns. I'm now running with a second smith, leatherworker, tailor, and engineer. Currently in the process of leveling a third engineer Hordeside so that in addition to having mounts to sell, I can make pets for my guild.</div></div><hr />

This would allow players to craft any recipe learned on the account by any character, but characters that do not have the corresponding profession at a skill level high enough to have learned the craft or gather the resource on their own would take three times as long to complete the cast. Additionally, primary professions should be transferrable between characters so that players can change profession perks to suit their needs; here's how I'd implement it:<br />
<br />
Unlearning a profession would create a single-use BoA item which corresponds to the highest completed skill level for that profession. When used, this item would teach that profession at the highest obtainable skill at that character's level. For example, a Level 86 Paladin unlearns 575/600 Blacksmithing, creating an 'Inherited Tome of Illustrious Grand Master Blacksmithing', which when used by a Level 53 monk from the same account teaches 375/375 Master Blacksmithing. Later, that monk automatically learns 450/450 Grand Mastery Blacksmithing at level 65 and 525/525 Illustrious Grand Master Blacksmithing at level 75, unless she has unlearned Blacksmithing in the interim, a process which would return another single-use BoA 'Inherited Tome of Illustrious Grand Master Blacksmithing'. When a character learns a profession this way it would trigger the cooldowns on any recipes for that profession on that character to prevent them from using cooldowns from more than two primary professions per day.</div></div><hr />

1) professions. This is by far the biggest reason. I don't like to beg in guild or trade chat to get things or to drop a ton of gold in the AH to get something. So I roll my alts, level them, and have them make the stuff I want.<br />
2) to see how the other half lives, class edition. Basically to see what the other classes have to offer. I started out with a hunter and then a druid. I needed a DE/banker mule so I made a shadow/disc priest. The shadow/disc priest is probably the one I have the most fun with.<br />
3) to see how the other half lives, horde edition. Most of my toons are alliance but I have a collection of horde alts as well.<br />
<br />
If professions went account wide then I probably would cut down on the number of alts but I'd probably still have a bunch of them.<br />
<br />
I'd be much more interested in a way to streamline leveling professions rather than making them account wide. For example, I'd like to see the Harvest Festival updated to be a profession leveling holiday much like the way the Thanksgiving Day event works for cooking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were the best 25 man guild for years and after going 10 man they're still at it 100%. I'm more impressed by this kill than any other kills so far.<br />

Now I specifically did choose the alts to take to 90 first based on their professions... like enchanting. It's just out of convenience and thriftiness. But I still like the character it just would have taken longer to level if I wasn't reliant on that profession for raiding.</div></div><hr />

At the very least, they should completely separate the gathering professions from the production ones. It's silly that gathering characters even exist simply because it was arbitrarily decided years ago that characters should have to specialize in picking flowers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't you mean combine? Gathering professions are already separate.<br />
<br />
The only profession right now that has a &quot;gathering&quot; type of thing is enchanting. I think they should revamp it to where if you pick up say, LW, you automatically get skinning. They have to get rid of the gathering perks but combining them makes more sense.</div></div><hr />

Now it takes so long to grind the materials in order to grind the recipe discovery that by the time you can make anything useful it's long past it's usefulness. I think Blizzard just keeps professions around to keep players busy.. give them something to do that is a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, I'm a completionist, so I'm dumb enough to keep that tread wheel going even though it's not even enjoyable anymore. <br />
<br />
I never wanted to get rich off professions by having all the recipes for all the professions. I just wanted to be able to craft things for myself without paying the ridiculous amounts people ask for when only a few people are willing to make it. There was a time when you could work hard to perfect your craft and ultimately make something useful for yourself. The iLevel churn has gotten to the point where if Blizzard allowed you to make something useful today, it's going to be worthless tomorrow... okay... maybe in two weeks. <br />
<br />
Blizzard will argue that this is the result of player demand for more content faster. Well who said that the players wanted more iLevel grind. I don't remember Blizzard asking anybody what players wanted in terms of more content faster. That leaves a lot to interpretation. Do we really want to grind new iLevels every few months? Not my idea of fun.<br />

Additionally.... I prefer the Skyrim method of professions. The player can master all profession given the time, effort, and persistence to do so. <br />
<br />
Also, do we really need a bazillion recipes to learn to make the daily discovery last along time? I mean... at this point we have the same piece of armor reworked 4 different ways with class specific binds. Same ilevel, same stat budget, but one for each class with of that armor type. Imagine the time and effort saved if that was one recipe that attuned itself to a class when equipped... Thunder Forged Mantle of the .... &lt;equip&gt; *POOF* HUNTER</div></div><hr />

There is one profession that should be account-wide and that is ENCHANTING. It would solve the problems of people not having enchanting mats or being forced to pay huge AH prices for them.<br />

I've taken the time to level ALL the professions on various alts. Some I have multiples of (alchemy, enchanting, JC, tailor-for the extra cloth). This was a deliberate choice. Nearly all of my toons have a crafting profession AND a gathering profession to feed the professions of all while leveling a toon. I would be VERY unhappy if the number of professions per account were limited in any way.</div></div><hr />

You know, if you have no clue how to spell something, instead of just making it up, you actually *are* allowed to consult a dictionary and/or the internet.</div></div><hr />
