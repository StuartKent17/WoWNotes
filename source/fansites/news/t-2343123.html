Once antorus releases, will mythic+ gear still be capped at +10? or will it be changed to +15 again?<br />
The ceiling on Mythic Keystone rewards will go up to 15 the week of Dec. 5, when the Mythic difficulty of Antorus opens. If you did a Mythic Keystone 11-15 the prior week, that effort will be reflected in your weekly chest on Dec. 5. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/928770460153556993))<br />

What is the current year lore wise in WoW? I'm saying 33, my friends are saying 38. Which of us is right?<br />
I believe we'd be going into 33 with BFA (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/928787858604802048))<br />
<br />
Hey Alex! May daily question in hopes that you'll respond: Will the Ebon Blade continue to create new death knights in BFA?<br />
DK creation exists in a pocket of time (Wrath) which is why you start at 55 and also why we have to be careful about what races can be DK. So DK creation will continue to exist in that fashion. (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/929790993905287169))<br />
Sorry for the many replies, but here is the quest: https://t.co/yokb4XF3Vs - notice what he says upon completion<br />
It doesn’t change how death knights are created in WoW. Which is back during the Wrath era. They are not mutually exclusive. (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/929821987756638208))<br />

#darpkitteh There was nothing wrong with that response, I think it described the situation very well and most of all it answered the question that was asked.<br />
<br />
The question was very obviously in reference to the fact that the Ebon Blade made new DKs (the four horseman) in Legion. So according to Alex that just isn’t canon then cause new DKs were only made in wrath? His answer was retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure what you did not understand by his answer. It is a clear &quot;No&quot;. He clarified that whatever DKs the ebon blade made was done in that pocket of time during wrath. AKA DKs are bound to whatever races were available at the time, thus the DK creation part. Meaning you can't make whatever the fuck future race a DK when it wasn't available during the timeline the ebon blade was making them.</div></div><hr />

that wasn't what the question was about. there's no way to read that question and see that it is about player dk creation, it's about the FACT that death knights are raising new death knights in legion. you recruit a guy to specifically do that for you. the asker even linked directly to the person that does it.<br />

I wonder how they'll explain Argus. I think it will be either:<br />
<br />
a) we will be resized to (almost) Titan scale in Seat of the Pantheon, <br />
b) Argus birth will be forced, so he will be some king of bastardized form of Titan,<br />
c) Sargeras will suck power from World Soul to gain physical form (&quot;rebirth&quot;), Argus will be just mindless shell that left.<br />
<br />

We know for sure they didn't abandon &quot;Titan is big as planet&quot;, since, you know, Sargeras will be as big as Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

Still, it's very strange to me that all we got from Sargeras is his voice. He should just destroy Azeroth like 5 minutes after Tomb of Sargeras ending. Also he wanted to possess Illidan's body in Nighthold, it doesn't really make sense if he has size of planet already.</div></div><hr />

I guarantee you we will see Sargeras in his full form, be it in a cinematic or in-game after Argus falls. He's going to be massive and probably a part of the skybox. Quote me on this!</div></div><hr />

<br />
He addressed it with the intent behind that question being playable DK races. It is easily assumed so considering the questions he answered mostly pertain to gameplay, not lore. <br />
<br />
&gt;Guy: will the ebon blade keep making DKs in BfA? (link: cuz here they did for legion!) Here is assumed if the ebon blade can make DKs whenever they feel like then they should make them for every race. <br />
&gt;Afrasiabi: DK creation in wow is based upon the wrath time pocket. They're not mutually exclusive. <br />
<br />
They can't just answer these questions easily considering the hurpadurps constantly bugging them for pandaren DKs. Not to mention upcoming allied races.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracullus</div><div class="date">2017-11-23, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guarantee you we will see Sargeras in his full form, be it in a cinematic or in-game after Argus falls.

<br />
Yeah, I know that. Some spell names from Mythic phase also suggest that he will be little more involved with our fight against Argus.<br />
<br />
But I'm talking about different thing - our campaign in Argus take some time, even in lore. Also we likely don't go to Argus right away after ToS - people freak out, we go with Magni to Scholazar Basin, draenei are preparing Vindicaar etc. So Sargeras has a lot of time to just come here and cleave Azeroth in half (even if he's far away, Legion must have good portal connection to their capital). Instead he is working on some kind of &quot;rebirth&quot; and try to turn Pantheon.<br />
<br />
It just don't make sense at all in he has body at the start of 7.3, but make perfect sense if he's just spirit/manifestation and gain body between Aggrammar and Argus fights (most likely we will have small cinematic also there ).</div></div><hr />

Well, you dont have to be rocket scientist to understand where the guy who asked the question was going. Ofc. they will continue to create DKs in BfA, but will players be able to play new races as a consequence?<br />
<br />
They're just too lazy to rework the DK starting zone and therefore enabling the possibility for players tonplay different races. That's why they answered that way. Player created DKs start in this time pocket during wrath. NPCs DKs can be any race, starting at any post-wrath point.</div></div><hr />

what the fuck is even that answer about dk creation? that guy an idiot?<br />
<br />
the person's not asking about player dk creation, jesus christ.<br />
<br />
Seems they took it as DK in game creation, not are DKs themselves creating current new DKs. (Like in Legion) TO be fair that was by the will of the Lich King, not the DK.</div></div><hr />

actually, no. the lich king gave you the power to raise horsemen, that's your ability now. it's not the lich king working through you, it's you.<br />
<br />
but we're talking about korgaz deadaxe, he shows that the knights can raise normal death knights on their own. the lich king didn't do anything for this.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's what i meant essentially. He said do it, but you are the one that did it. In game wise there was just no other time a DK decided on their own to do some rezzing. (battle rez aside)</div></div><hr />

i assume the extreme circumstances of a legion invasion is what pushed the knights into accepting raising new knights. they seemed content to simply die off over time before this invasion.<br />
<br />
the lich king didn't have anything to do with what korgaz is doing though. he was only involved in teaching you to raise horsemen. korgaz(and i assume his followers) are raising knights on their own.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah the LK definitely has his own intentions, but it's cool they added in the fact that the DKS have their own power to do their will as well.</div></div><hr />

My favorite being the one of the Ur'zul. The true terror of those abominations is displayed in all it's glory. The Uru'zul is scarier in that painting than in the game, which really speaks to the artist's talent (plus it's unique from the other art where Alleria seems to be the most popular subject to draw).<br />
<br />
The Ur'zul painting reminds me of something out of Attack on Titan where the Titans having creepily grinning faces.</div></div><hr />
