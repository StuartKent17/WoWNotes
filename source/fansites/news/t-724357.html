Cataclysm Beta -- Guild Contest<br />
If you think you and your guildmates have what it takes to make invaluable beta testers, take a stab at our Cataclysm Beta -- Guild Contest. All you need to do is tell us in a short essay why you and nine of your guildmates should be in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta test. We’ll be picking 100 winning submissions each week for five weeks, for a total of 5,000 beta keys at stake! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div style=&quot;width:70%;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
For World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we’re looking for a healthy handful of guilds to join us in the beta test process. If you think your guild would supply the perfect candidates for testing the limits of Cataclysm's content and systems, tell us why!<br />
<br />
4. Entry in the contest.<br />
Beginning on the Commencement Date, you can enter the Contest by emailing a short essay (50 to 250 words) elaborating on why the World of Warcraft guild that the entrant is the guild master of should take part in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Beta Test to blizzardcontest@blizzard.com. Your submission must be in English, and must be between 50 and 250 words in length to be considered for the Contest. You are limited to one (1) entry in the Contest. Any entries or submissions which depict or glorify overly graphic, lewd, obscene, vulgar or profane behavior, or which utilize lewd, obscene vulgar or profane language, either as part of the submission or as the name of the submission, will be disqualified at the sole discretion of Sponsor. <br />
<br />
All you have to do is send an email to <br />
blizzardcontest@blizzard.com containing a short essay between 50 and 250 words explaining why we should bring you and nine of your guild mates on-board. We’ll be picking 100 winning submissions from eligible participants each week for five weeks beginning Monday, June 7th through Monday, July 12th.<br />
<br />
Before entering the contest, be sure to read the full contest rules (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/contests/cataclysm-beta/contest-rules.html)for details and eligibility.<br />
<br />
Important - Adobe Flash Player Vulnerability<br />
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in Adobe Flash Player 10.0.45.2 and Adobe Reader/Acrobat 9.x, and could potentially be used to target World of Warcraft players and accounts. The newest available version of Adobe Flash 10.1, Release Candidate 7 (available at http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/), does not appear to contain this vulnerability, and we recommend that everyone upgrade their Flash player as soon as possible. Earlier versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat, specifically version 8.x, do not appear to contain this vulnerability, either.<br />
<br />
For more information, please visit Adobe.com: http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa10-01.html<br />
<br />
Get an Authenticator if you haven't got one already. Get your very own guard dog and secure your account at the same time. Visit http://us.battle.net/security for more info!<br />
<br />
I would also like to add that this is NOT a virus. The only way to protect yourself from this kind of vulnerability is to keep your system up-to-date in all ways, including Flash. <br />
<br />
Curse Client Google Ad Scam<br />
A few months ago a couple of people got hacked because of malicious google ads redirecting to fake armory pages. (See this news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/armory-scams-blue-posts-free-character-moves-147499/))<br />
<br />
The same problem is now affecting the Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/) client that many of you use to update and download addon. <br />

Seeing as Blizz always favor US testers over EU testers. Then again, giving one to Korea and not to Europe seems a bit... strange... Who knows.<br />
<br />
Also, I wonder if they're planning to let all 5000 testers from this competition onto the realms at the same time as all the others picked from the opt-ins, friends &amp; family etc... My theory is that they'll be siphoning them in batch by batch to prevent massive server load.</div></div><hr />

How so? Boub put it on here about 20 minutes after the Bluepost was done<br />
<br />
Looking at the rules... it looks like the only valid submissions are from the guild GMs right?<br />
<br />
you can enter the Contest by emailing a short essay (50 to 250 words) elaborating on why the World of Warcraft guild that the entrant is the guild master of should take part in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Beta Test<br />

<br />
<br />
My friend, inactive guild leader of a guild which I was essentially running, got hacked. We lost our guild, our guild bank, its contents and the name because we can't get our GL online to sort it out.<br />
<br />
Lesson #1: Don't let your GL go inactive without handing someone else leadership of the guild.<br />
Lesson #2: Don't let anyone with the ability to kick people from the guild, remove items or gold from the guild bank or the ability to disband the guild go around without an authenticator.<br />

From the Contest Rules link, bolded by myself for emphasis:<br />
<br />
THIS CONTEST IS OPEN ONLY TO LEGAL RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE NOT RESIDENTS OF THE STATES OF NORTH DAKOTA, VERMONT, CONNECTICUT, OR MARYLYAND AND WHO: (I) HAVE A BATTLE.NET ACCOUNT THAT IS IN GOOD STANDING DURING THE CONTEST; (II) HAVE AUTHORIZED ACCESS TO A WORLD OF WARCRAFT ACCOUNT THAT IS IN GOOD STANDING AND HAS BEEN UPGRADED WITH BOTH “THE BURNING CRUSADE” AND “WRATH OF THE LICH KING,”</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilinor</div><div class="date">2010-06-08, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason that it says residents of the US only, is because different countries have different laws regarding contests where you win anything, especially online.<br />
<br />
This is also the reason why some states are excluded from the contest. So instead of researching EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. They made it easy and made it US only, since a vast majority of the US server players are from the US.<br />
<br />
When they do Europe (they will eventually) it will be a select group of countries. Thats how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's can't be entirely true can it. I highly doubt that they will give beta keys to people on July 12 and then close the door on them the next day. So that leaves two possibilities:<br />
<br />
(1) The closed beta will start on or after July 12.<br />
(2) If the closed beta starts before July 12 if will still be going on after July 12.<br />
<br />
I think it's a safe bet that the closed beta will start sometime on or before July 12.</div></div><hr />

Can you imagine what would happen if every member of a 25-man guild was allowed to submit their essay? Blizzard would get flooded with even more pointless &quot;my guild iz teh best&quot; than the few guild masters who actually have that attitude. It would take a hundred times as long time to go over all the submissions as well.<br />
<br />
If you think you can write a better essay than your guild leader, ask for a thread on your forum where you can all post your suggestions to make the best submission ever and win the prize, instead of being selfish and thinking you're better than everyone around you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would you want to prevent massive server load in a beta? You don't think day one of Cataclysm isn't going to bring massive server load? They need to do whatever they can to stress the hell out of the servers to find out if they can handle it or not, so that we don't see them spending a week after release trying to boost the servers to handle the bandwidth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't want to prevent massive server load in beta, but you probably want to prevent it in the beginning of beta. You want to make sure the basic stuff works, then, as time goes on, gradually increase the load until it approaches expected &quot;normal&quot; levels. You'll note that they are going to continue to announce more and more winners as time goes on? That's one way to ramp up the load.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my next point. This is nowhere near all the beta keys that will go out. My server is pretty low pop and it has over 10K population (not all at once obviously, but total). Bigger servers seem to have 20-30K populations. Since they will want to load test, final numbers of beta testers will have to approximate at least several full server pops. My guess is that final beta number will be in the hundreds of thousands for the US servers. If you don't get a beta key at release, don't despair. More will go out.<br />
<br />
Part of me thinks &quot;they announced Asian contests yesterday, US contest today, I bet EU will be later today or tomorrow&quot;. It would make sense to follow the time zones. Part of me think that EU consumer protection laws are so strict as to make this sort of contest non-viable in Europe. If there isn't an EU contest it will almost certainly be because of legal hurdles, not because Blizz hates you guys. Your consumer protection laws are a double edged sword. They go a long want to protect you from predatory practices that are perfectly legal here in the States, but they also prevent some fun things from legitimate companies.<br />

Being cautious has nothing to do with a Flash vulnerability, unless you're saying that Flash should never be enabled. Which is like saying that Flash shouldn't exist, which seems a lot more extreme than just saying &quot;they should fix the known vulnerabilities.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
So yea um, what was your point again?<br />
<br />
<br />
The point being that this French company has a controlling share of Activision Blizzard, but the subsidiary company runs autonomously. For all intents and purposes, it is its own company.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deepone</div><div class="date">2010-06-09, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The advice &quot;don't google them,&quot; seems a tad on the harsh side.<br />
<br />
Here's how you use Google, folks:<br />
<br />
Search for the terms you are interested in. In Firefox, this is accomplished most easily by typing &quot;Ctrl-t &lt;tab&gt;&quot; and then entering your search term(s) in the search widget. In Chrome, you want to just type &quot;Ctrl-t&quot; and your search term(s).<br />
<br />
When the results come up, you see many things at once. At the top, you may see &quot;Sponsored links&quot;. In general, you should ignore any links in this section (I do), but Google is very good about telling you what site you're going to visit when clicking one of these. You'll see 3 things in a sponsored link:<br />
<br />
* Site name (can be misleading)<br />
* URL (usually in green by default, below name)<br />
* Descriptive text (just ad text, ignore)<br />
<br />
If the site that you want is the one listed in the URL such as &quot;mmo-champion.com&quot; then it's safe to click the link, but you have to be REALLY careful to double-check the link name. It might be &quot;mmo-chumpion.com&quot; or something equally crafty. If you see a deceptive link name, feel free to report it to Google. They'll cancel people's ad campaigns for that faster than Blizzard boots gold farmers (a LOT faster).<br />
<br />
Now, moving past sponsored links section, you have regular links. I just searched for &quot;mmo champion&quot; and got this:<br />

MMO-Champion - World of Warcraft Guides and Raid Strategies<br />

More results from mmo-champion.com »<br />
<br />
Again, there are several sections:<br />
<br />
* Name (just a page title, can be misleading)<br />
* Description (snippet of page, can be misleading)<br />
* URL (e.g. &quot;www.mmo-champion.com/&quot;, read this carefully)<br />
* Some sites have a list of common links<br />
* At the bottom you may see &quot;more results from&quot;...<br />
<br />
The most critical part is the URL. Read it carefully, and if it's the site you expected to see results from, then it's safe to visit. If it's a misleading name like &quot;mmo-chumpion.com&quot; then I recommend not visiting it. In that case, they've already proven to be less than trustworthy, so there's no need to give them a second chance.<br />
<br />
The list of common links is safe if you trust the site listed in the URL. They will be links to the same site, but to sub-pages linked to from the page in the main result. For example, a Google search for MMO Champion shows items like &quot;Forum&quot; and &quot;Talent calculator&quot; that go to the respective sections of the site.<br />
<br />
In fact, these sub-section links are partially controlled by MMO Champion. Their main page has special code that tells Google which links are important for visiting sub-sections and Google remembers this for later. They then provide the list of the most commonly visited sub-sections in search results.<br />
<br />
And there you have it. That's how you safely use Google search. Happy searching.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-06-09, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you think adobe is the only program to have holes in it, you are mistaken. HTML5 will have plenty of holes in it, but you will have to wait till it is widely adopted before people start looking for them. <br />
<br />
Until it is widely accepted that no program is 100% safe, the internet will be full of suckers.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm picking nits here, but it's an important nit. HTML5 will not have vulnerabilities. It's a standard, not a piece of software. Implementations will have vulnerabilities, certainly, but that's not the same thing. This is important because it's a question of scale. When Flash Player has a vulnerability it mean that Flash has a vulnerability, the product and the standard are essentially the same thing. When I.E. 10 has an HTML5 related vulnerability, that does not per se indicate that Safari 6, Firefox 5, or Chrome 4 have the same vulnerability.</div></div><hr />
