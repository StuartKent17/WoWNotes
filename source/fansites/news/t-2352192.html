<br />
Vengeance Demon Hunters now correctly generate Pain when damaged by certain abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Seat of the Triumvirate<br />
<br />
Players may now complete &quot;Seat of the Triumvirate: The Crest of Knowledge&quot; while in a raid group.<br />
<br />
Antorus, The Burning Throne<br />
<br />
Corrected an issue where raids that queued for LFR difficulty could fail to get loot.<br />
Garothi Worldbreaker<br />
<br />
The damage reduction from Apocalypse Drive and from a Druidâ€™s Earthwarden can now activate during the Garothi Worldbreaker encounter.<br />
<br />
Hounds of Sargeras<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue that could cause multiple tank-specialization characters to gain Shadowtouched (or Flametouched) simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Portal Keeper Hasabel<br />
<br />
Traversing any of the portals within Portal Keeper Hasabel's arena no longer removes your Well Fed buff.<br />
<br />
Varimathras<br />
<br />
[WITH SERVER RESTARTS IN EACH REGION] Varimathras' health lowered by 10% in Mythic difficulty.<br />
[WITH SERVER RESTARTS IN EACH REGION] Necrotic Embrace will no longer miss players who are under the effects of Aspect of the Turtle or Cloak of Shadows.</div></div><hr />

It looks like we know how several guilds avoided that mechanic in its entirety now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can just assume the top guilds have enough alts/class combos to kill it without cheese. i.e. Method reclearing 10/11 M today in like 2 hours or some shit. So top guilds are fine without the cheese.</div></div><hr />
