This year, for the first time, you'll have the opportunity to enjoy a live Internet stream of BlizzCon coverage from the comfort of your own home. The stream includes the same content as the DIRECTV pay-per-view event, but you do not have to be a DIRECTV subscriber to purchase it. It consists of over 16 hours of video, including interviews and commentary, main stage presentations, and tournament coverage. It’s now available to order for $39.95, and purchasers will also receive the BlizzCon 2009-exclusive in-game pet, Grunty the Murloc Marine (not available in all regions). Head over to the BlizzCon 2009 Live Stream website to get more information, to test video playback on your system, or to place an order.<br />

So, what in &quot;WoW Pvp&quot; &quot;Dungeon and raids&quot; and &quot;Classes&quot; excludes the expansion pack?<br />

<br />
The cast of The Guild was at the convention last year as well. Very funny group of people.<br />
<br />
I was at Blizzcon 2007 when WotLK was announced and the panels were pretty much titled exactly as they are for this year. Basically, if a new xpac is announced then the panels will just center around new things they have coming as a result. The thing I learned at last years Blizzcon though ... is that they aren't going to need to make any ground breaking announcements to hold a Blizzcon. About the biggest thing announced at last years was a new Diablo III class.</div></div><hr />

You're right in regards to the 2 year gaps in expansions (if you assume things will continue as they have... which they very well could). But your timeline is off:<br />
<br />
Blizzcon #1 (2005): TBC announced.<br />
Blizzcon #2 (2007): WotLK announced (no Blizzcon in 2006)<br />
Blizzcon #3 (2008): Diablo III Class announced<br />
<br />
The point of my post was that there will be Blizzcon's without *major* announcements and we're not even sure that there will be one every year. Personally I would be blown away if they didn't announce an xpac. Can't wait to see what the Opening Ceremony has in store for us!</div></div><hr />

They have batteries.<br />
Therefore they are not suited for gaming.<br />
<br />
And I'm not talking about 1-2 hours a week gaming, but actual G A M I N G.<br />
Wireless is crap. Batteries expensive, or faulty after a few recharges.<br />
<br />
Just use a damn wire and you're all good for ages without a care in the world about the damn batteries going empty or overcharging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I presume you mean the App Store. And streaming on to a cell phone/handheld device compared to a desktop or laptop is clunky and slow.<br />
<br />
On the quality; I presume that's just a taste. Other people say you can install software (in this thread even, I think) to get the stream at a higher quality.</div></div><hr />

I ended up going back to my hotel and reading WoWInsider and MMO-Champ for the info.<br />
<br />
I just hope you will be able to clearly hear at each discussion area--there's a LOT of noise in general going on in the halls--between the tournament stuff and the announcers calling the &quot;plays&quot; and then just the noise of people. Hopefully they sprinkled more screens around so you could see what was going on at the other stages.<br />

Yay! Someone else is having a party for the stream too! I'm hosting one on the East Coast since I didn't get tickets to BlizzCon this year (friends are too broke to go with us every BlizzCon we made). Doing a lot of homemade food (husband was thrilled when I told him I was doing homemade bread/ice cream/pasta sauce/tamales/etc.) for the 2 days of the stream. We'll be setting up our dining room for a LAN party, which overlooks the family room where we'll be dumping the stream onto our Samsung LCD TV.<br />

<br />
You can do that for the Q&amp;A Panel...but if you're considered an OP class by the majority of the WoW population (which pretty much everyone has a hatred for DKs and Pallies), the attendees will usually boo you when you start talking.<br />
<br />
Plus you have to race to get in line ahead of all the unwashed con-goers. I usually just sit and chuckle when Q&amp;A rolls around...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Guild was up against the WoW Q&amp;A panel last year too :P. They're actually even more lucky now, because Blizzard made one nice change. Last year, they only had three main halls open for stuff and you had to go upstairs to access some panels (one of them being The Guild's panel) in a much smaller room. It looks like they've made this much better now with two separate halls for hosting events... albeit the main hall will always be bigger since it's meant to seat people for the shows and stuff.<br />
<br />
My life was a bit too tumultuous to go this year, so I'll be watching from the stream :). Have to watch eBay to snipe me a goodie bag too ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
New Expansion pretty much confirmed! (Unless they take an hour on previewing 3.3)<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoted for importance, Thank you very much. Although I'd rather see more options, would be nice to see the UI discussion, instead of the DiabloIII panel, I know I'd like to see diablo, but you can't be at two places at once.<br />
<br />
More importantly I'd rather see the classes panel, instead of the Diablo Art, and they are not apparantly showing the PVP discussion, and instead showing Starcraft II.<br />
<br />
UMM we sure this Rayx information is correct its jumbled. Its like it's not live or something??? The time for the class panel is 5pm, while its 3pm on the schedule and a different day. Furthermore in the mmo-champion panels, their is no preview panel?<br />

I would highly doubt to see an expansion released in december/ january. At most i would presume it would be later near march maybe? Still 2/3 weeks until the normal mode Argent Col is fully released. Once normal mode is cleared then we would have to wait and see would the hardmodes be released the same. After that give it 1-2 months on that content before the ptr hits for 3.3 if that. I would say 3.3 could be here for november maybe december if at the latest then another 3-4 months on the instance itself normal plus hardmode. By the time the alpha and beta testing completed your looking at the expansion being released well into 2010.</div></div><hr />

Ill guess 3.3 is before xmas, to take advantage of the kiddies being home for winter break. And Cataclysm i see coming out sometime next summer rather than winter, maybe August or September.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't think they would allot a whole hour just to talk about Icecrown Citadel. We all know what's going to happen: We kill Arthas, but the spirit of Nerzhul (lich king) will live on, and blah blah (in before &quot;ICECROWN CITADEL WAS MERELY A SETBACK!).<br />
<br />
But imagine: Goblin Race, Goblin classes, Worgen Race, Worgen Classes, Lore for the second sundering, Azshara, Deathwing... I can go on forever, and these stuff will definitely take more than an hour if they choose to talk about them all.</div></div><hr />

care to elaborate?<br />
<br />
3.3 will most likely hit live Realms in early December, and I can't see how that should last for over a year worth of play. (3.3 is the final content Patch FYI)<br />
<br />
I'd say: mid 2010 for Cataclysm, maybe even earlier, if the &quot;preview&quot; of mmo-champion is correct, because a lot of content would just have to be retuned and not created from scratch</div></div><hr />
