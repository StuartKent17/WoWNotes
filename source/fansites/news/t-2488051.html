Rogue poisons is ok to call it because it's not a venom. The rogue isn't biting you with his venom. He is stabbing you with weapons dipped in poison. Makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
Snapdragons and their bite and calling it poisonous is incorrect tho.</div></div><hr />

how so? a posion is something fatal if you drink<br />
a venom is something fatal if it goes into the blood stream<br />
<br />
hell you can drink snake venom. alkthoguh its not reccomended.<br />
<br />
but no, how is a rogue posion not a venom? its fatal when stabbed into you, the rogue is not as an attack poruing a vial of posion doen the persons throat, they are stabbing them with posion covered blades... like venom filled fangs...<br />
<br />
rogue posions are venoms, even though they are called posion.<br />
hell rogues have things called venoms, creeping venom, and passives that were called stuff like venom rush.<br />
they know they are venoms, but they were called posions, so they are still called poisions.</div></div><hr />

Poisonous/ Venomous is only a thing when discussing animals etc. We can call it poison when talking about weapons. Ever heard of the poison dart frog? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having a &quot;most powerful&quot; racial trait that is so powerful it causes significant faction imbalance for PvP is not healthy. Having one that is &quot;practically useless&quot;, but still has uses, (like many other racials) makes a lot more sense.<br />
<br />
Honestly they need to just make a PvP balance pass on all racials then stop screwing with them. At this point it is hard to see it as anything more than a money grab: Everyone rolls human for EMFH &gt; nerf EMFH &gt; everyone rolls belf for arcane torrent &gt; nerf arcane torrent &gt; everyone rolls anything other than belf &gt; release a bunch of allied races &gt; people switch to allied races &gt; revert EMFH &gt; everyone rolls human...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well anyways, it's supposed to be venom because the difference between venom/poison is the method of delivery of the toxin.<br />
<br />
If something bites you and injects a toxin in the wound, it's venomous (hence's snapdragon's bite)<br />
<br />
Now if the toxin is ingested, comes into contact with skin, or inhaled, it's poisonous.<br />
<br />
A Rogue's Poison can be derived from a Venom, but when referring to animals it refers to how the animal delivers the toxin (both venom and poison are derivatives of the word 'toxin')<br />
<br />
Think of a puffer fish and a blue-ringed octopus. Both have tetrodotoxin, but a puffer fish is poisonous because the delivery of said toxin only happens when you eat it, whereas a blue-ringed octopus delivers tetrodotoxin via a bite (i.e. it eats you or is defending itself by biting you).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what I was wondering, my bet right now is he is the last boss of the new 15 year LFR raid they are working on.</div></div><hr />
