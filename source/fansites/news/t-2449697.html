Blizzard suspects many Alliance players had &quot;rough experiences early on and opted out&quot; of War Mode, and the increased rewards may bring people back in.<br />
<br />
Is Ion for real? He thinks that increased rewards will bring alliance back into warmode, when the vast majority of alliance have forgotten that warmode even exists? <br />
<br />
This kind of measure is too little too late. A few alliance may turn on warmode, find themselves getting facing repeated 10v1 situations and then turn it off again.<br />
Some time ago we made a hotfix to War Mode which enforces all War Mode shards that have both Alliance and Horde in them to have a stricter, more even ratio. We’ve been monitoring the results and so far we’ve noticed a significant improvement in “fair and balanced” shards. So much so that it’s safe to say that if you are Alliance, and you see Horde in the outdoor world in War Mode, you are a relatively even horde to alliance ratio shard. There are some rare exceptions, such as when a raid of 40 players enter a zone. It may take a bit for the “shard manager” to compensate and balance the shard.<br />
<br />
We do have some plans in store in Tides of Vengeance (Patch 8.1) to entice the underrepresented faction with greater rewards to increase participation and create more active Horde/Allianced mixed War Mode shards. The intent of those rewards is not to give the underrepresented faction some “compensation” for being outnumbered in a War Mode shard (since that really can’t happen anymore). <br />
<br />
We're also looking forward to what you all think about the Incursions in War Mode for 8.1, since it brings Horde and Alliance to the same location which should create some pretty fun skirmishes.<br />
<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - November 15th - 19th<br />
On Thursday, November 15th and Friday, November 16th we will be conducting raid tests of the Battle of Dazar'alor. After testing has ended up Friday, we will open the first wing of Raid Finder.<br />
<br />
BOTH FACTIONS:<br />
Testing is open for both factions. However, for some bosses, raid members will temporarily re-live events as the opposite faction using a story flashback.<br />
<br />
Thursday, November 15th<br />
<br />
Stormwall Blockade - Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
13:00 PST (16:00 EST, 22:00 CET)<br />
<br />
Jaina - Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
14:00 PST (17:00 EST, 23:00 CET)<br />
<br />
Friday, November 16th<br />
<br />
Opulence - Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
13:00 PST (16:00 EST, 22:00 CET)<br />
<br />
King Rastakhan - Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
14:00 PST (17:00 EST, 23:00 CET)<br />
<br />
Siege of Dazar'alor/Defense of Dazar'alor Raid Finder<br />
16:00 PST (19:00 EST, 1:00 CET)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are only 2 fixes:<br />
1) Make alliance racials undoubtly better, and profoundly so. Let the factions balance themselves out for a year and nerf it into balance when everything is even again.<br />
2) Make war mode a que. Right now horde just turns it on and forgets about it. Make it an opt in shard.<br />

Nuclear option) Merge factions. Everyone can group up with each other. Let people pick their race, and pick between &quot;green&quot; and &quot;purple&quot; in a new expansion, idk<br />

Let's assume for a moment that a shard can contain up to 200 players at a time. Right now, that's probably 50 Alliance and 150 Horde. Either they are going to have to cap the number of Horde on a shard to match the number of Alliance in which case there will be some shards without any or it's just going to be the same as it is right now.</div></div><hr />

That is exactly what they're doing....<br />
<br />
If a shard accepts 200 people and there are only 50 alliance in warmode, its only going to allow roughly 50 horde on that shard.<br />
<br />
I'm not at all a fan for increasing rewards for alliance just because they're too pansy to turn on warmode. Sharding is there to make sure ratios are balanced, so any complaining at this point is just that, complaining.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that &quot;balance&quot; is not an equilibrium state. Gradually, everyone will gravitate to one side or the other. Their only option is to keep putting their thumb on the scale every time they see it tilting, and that's lame.<br />

It was equal for many years in the game. The problem stemmed from the horde racials when mythics were released and it took years to finally nerf them. <br />
This is a recent problem. Removing factions would honestly make everyone happy at this point. Maybe let people choose their faction</div></div><hr />

You can choose your faction now. And how lame it would be if they removed factions, it's the core of the game. If you dont like it I find it odd you picked up WoW in the first place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonSerrot</div><div class="date">2018-11-15, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO, the very fact that there is a reward aside from the honor you get from killing someone is the problem in and of itself. As a Horde player I feel like I HAVE to have War Mode on because otherwise I'm squandering the free 10% bonus I get for being on the dominant faction. I don't have to worry about potential lost time when there isn't an enemy to act as a hindrance. If there was no bonus then I honestly wouldn't have War Mode on at all, and I know there are a lot of people who feel the same way. Remove the bonus and it'll naturally even out with just the people who actually do want to engage in world PVP. It was an interesting idea on paper that just doesn't seem to work in practice.</div></div><hr />

Define &quot;many years&quot;... in the US, faction balance was a distant memory by Cata. Sure, in Classic wow people didn't care, but as people got better and the game matured, faction balance died a swift and decisive death. Sure there were some servers that were 100% horde and some were 100% ally, but that's not balance.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely correct. No amount of increased rewards is going to get me to turn on War Mode. I refuse to have my play time interrupted by other players in ways I can't control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I kept running into, however, was raid groups numbering 20-40. And no, my idea of a good time isn't scraping together another huge raid to fight them. If that's what I cared about then I'd queue for a pvp instance.</div></div><hr />

Server specific yes, there was always one-sidedness<br />
But this is the first time that as a whole, the entire game has a faction imbalance. Take a look at PVE and PVP rankings, all the best players switched to horde, a lot because they had to. Alliance guilds struggle to recruit players cause the population keeps shrinking, so guilds are disbanding, which leads to a positive feedback.<br />

Yeah don't forget the years of &quot;good-natured teasing&quot; by the devs at BlizzCon which included telling Alliance players that they should die.<br />

No, the lack of interest in Alliance story or characters is embedded deep and goes years back. This won't change anything, and no, they won't admit their hand in it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennett</div><div class="date">2018-11-15, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt they will ever fix warmode. I think it just comes down to culture, generally speaking, Alliance players are just not as pvp inclined as Horde players, if you like PVP, you're more likely to pick the more savage/ brutal characters (hence why PVP gear is often more savage looking than PVE gear) and the Horde is generally a more ferocious and brutal faction. Plus I always get the feeling Horde players are far more proud of their faction and hostile to the Alliance players than Alliance players are, who seem more chilled out. As someone who plays both sides, I don't give a fuck about PVP and mostly keep warmode off apart from leveling. I've got two horde and two alliance at 120, while leveling, I think I got ganked once or twice leveling my Hordies - whereas leveling as an Alliance I lost count and had to turn it off. Just players choose different factions for different reasons, and PVP minded people tend to prefer Horde</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nathasil</div><div class="date">2018-11-15, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They cannot win this. And most people who thought about warmode when it was announced realised this.<br />
<br />
Factions &amp; Balance don't mix. You could start with a perfectly balanced 50:50 ratio...and as soon as there is the PERCEPTION of one faction winning more it will instantly go 45:55...from this point on it will only get worse, because people join the larger faction. You only care about the players you can play/group with. You do not care aout players you cannot play/group with.<br />
<br />
Of course all raiders want to play the same faction to have the biggest possible pool of recruits for the guilds AND the biggest possible pool of guilds for the recruits.<br />
<br />
Of course &quot;real&quot; PvP players want to play the same faction, as this allowes them to form groups for rated. And since rated does ignore factions you can even have a healthy rivalry AND be able to group up for other nights. How awesome is that?<br />
<br />
Of course good M+ puggers want to all play on one faction. They are very picky about their pugs and once you go &gt;15 the pool of available players is small enough already.<br />
<br />
So, there really is no reason to not play the larger/more active faction. Hall of Fame is a neat idea...but recruiting is the worst part about being a mythic raider and i doubt a title will offset the hassle of harder recruiting for most GL. But it might at least stop the bleeding towards the red faction.<br />
<br />
As for Warmode in particular....there are 2 types of shards you can be on (as a Horde player): A shard with a somewhat 50:50 A:H population that gets turned upside down all the time due to raid WQs....and 100% Horde shards with not a single Alliance on them.

Still the only and best solution in this case is to make WM what it is - battleground. Ie there will be people who put there in portions and after groups formation. Everything at once will back at own places itself, because will shrinks to private solutions level, which they have already had for a long time. They invent their own problems, where they should not be by definition. What they did will never be able to replace PvP servers, because it doesn't obey their basic rules (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2392477-What-Would-Make-You-Never-Burnout?p=49271189&amp;viewfull=1#post49271189).<br />

Doing a WQ and engaging in the occasional 1v1 (hate unbalanced zergs, no matter who has the numbers), it keeps ending up with getting 5-6 additional Alliance players piling on top of me. Every single group I’ve made/joined for wPvP has been to counter a group of Alliance hoarding a WQ and 10-jumping everything in sight. I *always* engage any lone player I face, and even if I end up being outplayed and killed it’s fun, and the reason I have War Mode on after all. The groups roaming around are disgusting, and I’ll usually form a group quick as all hell to crush a group of Alliance if they’re doing that to a WQ site, then leave/disband it once the Alliance group is scattered.<br />

How are factions the &quot;core of the game&quot; if they're completely irrelevant to the majority of content. In terms of questing, dungeons, and raids all they do is serve as a barrier to prevent half the players from grouping with the other half.</div></div><hr />

I dare you to look up my old comments where I said: &quot;this warmode thing will end world PVP&quot; before the exp. They f*cked up the faction balance long time ago. They should had to fix that immediately back then. <br />
<br />
They should just remove every reward from this system. When you roll horde it means PVP mode forever because you will mow alliance players (if you find any) down wih the gankers who always up at every WQ. And this &quot;free reward&quot; gives more reason to make horde characters which is even more destroying faction balance.<br />
<br />
When I tried to level my alliance character in war mode I found 5man horde teams at key questline givers so they were able to stop our progress in the zone for hours... When I leveled my horde character I didn't see any alliance players (max level) to be honest only horde groups who were front of the natural quest hubs. What a joke Blizzard...</div></div><hr />

Sure, in Classic wow people didn't care, but as people got better and the game matured, faction balance died a swift and decisive death. Sure there were some servers that were 100% horde and some were 100% ally, but that's not balance.<br />
Listen to this guy. He can see into the future where Classic exists.<br />
The death of balance was as soon as they allowed an account to have both factions on a PvP server. That was the biggest mistake Blizzard ever did for WoW. Overnight, slightly imbalanced servers became very imbalanced. It caused the eventually death of factions on servers. It got so bad that a nobody like me was in the second best raiding guild in my faction. We only killed 4 heroic bosses in SoO! <br />
Warmode has been a failure. Just give everyone free transfers to PvE servers if they want and go back to how it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leveling Horde can play shard roulette with a 80% chance of having an alliance free shard and a 20% chance of a 'balanced' shard, Alliance gets a 100% chance of ending up in a 50/50 shard.<br />
<br />
If you are one of the ~15% players that likes wPvP even more bonus might sound good. If you are part of the 85% that doesn't want wPvP but wants the leveling bonus and access to the walled of talents, well, the Horde is still there for you.</div></div><hr />

These kind of conclusions are ridiculous at best. I guess alliance &quot;culture&quot; shifted from MoP/WoD when Alliance completely dominated PvP.

Blizzard always assumes people do things just for the reward. If that were the case, I'd be goose-stepping through content like Blizzard intends me to, but I've been there and done that. It doesn't entice me anymore. I am looking for good playing experience, something I can immerse myself in. What Blizzard seems to ignore is playing experience. The fundamental question of: &quot;Is that fun?&quot; seems to elude Blizzard these days. Their idea of War Mode completely misses the mark by tying immersion to their grand story arch, and they expect players behave like extras in a movie. However, players don't seem to act according to the script which is terrible for their selling point of having a newly rekindled faction war. A significant war whose goal is entirely intransparent for the player but they expect the player to act well until they deign to tell us. So what does that leave to us?<br />
PVE rewards tied to PVP and a PVP system that doesn't do much else than promoting a grind for rewards. The experience between is still embedded in PVE-based systems and functionality. I have to do world PVE to engage other players in PVP or find players engaged in PVE activities just as usual. However since the Blizzard has already stripped down world activities to the level up process and world quests, this means world PVP happens primarily in PVE world quest hubs confined to their new content, like sandbox fights for kids who happen to want to play in a sandbox. It is neither her an enjoyable experience nor does it feel like war but more like skirmish because of random reasons or misclick. <br />
<br />
It is inferior to the old experience when there were PVP objectives or PVP-related subzones in a region or when people had world activities to commit to and even if it was just farming for reagents. When conquering an enemy capital was actually on the table but with Blizzard slowly phasing out the old world entirely this has become a nerd's pastime. There is no well-thought-out world layer for PVP, and it's even behind other expansions where instead of iterating for improvement they did away with it. That was until this expansion where instead of working on world PVP content they decided to go the lazy skinner box reward route of attaching it to PVE rewards. This is like selling a sports car but giving it the engine of a lawnmower. Well, I am sad to say this, but this is why after all I opted out too, and this is why I prefer to play online games where immersion is still a factor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I transferred all my characters from PvP servers to PvE servers. I've been on PvP servers for 10 years. I'm done with it. I don't want it. <br />
<br />
This is either<br />
<br />
1) Not going to bring a lot of Alliance players back<br />
or<br />
2) Bring some Alliance players back, but they'll still not enjoy the experience, cause they are just forcing themselves through it for some reward<br />
<br />
In my opinion they should just go back to PvP and PvE servers. I don't really see the point in getting rid of that distinction. Other than giving people a free &quot;transfer&quot; away from whatever type of server they were on. But at least on PvP servers, people were forced to PvP all the time, and it was their own fault if they were on it. Now, people just opt out of that gameplay, which is almost like everyone of a certain faction is leaving the server. Leaving one faction dominant on the &quot;server&quot;. So no one gets what they want.</div></div><hr />

Fully half the world pvp experiences I have when I do turn it on involve being ganked from stealth by a rogue as soon as I pull a bunch of mobs together or attack an elite mob. The bounty system also is made basically unplayable by the addition of stealth. There is no point trying to chase down a bounty because it is inevitably a rogue or druid who you will never be able to find baiting for their friends to gank, and if, as a non-rogue you do get a bounty, then death comes when you get 100-0 in 2 seconds by three people ganking you out of stealth at the same time. What is the point of gameplay where if you are the attacker you can't see the targets and if you are the target you can't see your attackers.<br />
<br />
It's hardly a new insight and it is the main reason I have almost zero interest in playing classic when it comes out. I spent enough years putting up with that crap as an alliance warlock in vanilla that I have zero desire to revisit the experience. Stealth has being the problem hanging over world PvP since classic but for some reason Blizzard seem to hold to the idea that because dying because you got jumped out of stealth is very annoying that somehow that makes it a compelling gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
And it also makes the experience less compelling on the other side. Being able to survive with a bounty as a rogue is fun for about 10 seconds until you realise that basically all you have to do is move around in stealth, and if you do kill someone, well then it is a shallow experience because you know the deck is stacked so heavily in your favour in world PvP that it robs it of all enjoyment.</div></div><hr />

I don't even understand their rational. I'm not suggesting they make it as easy to turn on as /pvp (Even though thats all it really is), just open it up to any city. Yeah yeah, I know some people will say its not hard to portal and then hearthstone then portal back, but it's just unreasonable in the first place to have gone out of their way to make people have to do that. All it serves is to divide people who are looking up to group up to do PVE content with other people at this point, which is inane. Given the grinding/chore doing nature of this game getting ganked by 4 people when your solo isn't fun. Having 20 people of the opposite faction in the zone doing the world quests you're trying to get done before work and having to hide because you cant solo them, isn't fun... I mean... doing endless world quests with rewards you don't care about to grind rep isn't fun to start with. Hamstringing yourself and your progression for a pittance of a reward is just, awkward. All it does is just waste your time, even if you enjoy PVP.</div></div><hr />

If a shard accepts 200 people and there are only 50 alliance in warmode, its only going to allow roughly 50 horde on that shard.<br />

<br />
Indeed. I often play alone, but I have always kep WM on, besides on my alts. I have mostly played my Human Paladin and I got ganked and killed alot while leveling and at max level by horde.<br />
<br />
I have in the recent weeks mostly played my Orc Warrior and thats a whole different story. Not once have I been attacked by alliance and I often see horde stomping alliance.<br />
<br />
My general notion is that once one side is in bigger numbers, the higher the % of a attack. My personal experience is that this almost all of the time means horde attacks alliance.<br />
<br />
On my alliance char all I see is horde players at WQs areas. On my horde chars I also mostly see most horde chars.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW - if anyone is &quot;pansy&quot; here its horde. They never attack you unless the outnumber you 3/1. Most times it 10+ horde stomping you the second you approach a WQ.<br />
<br />
The brave souls are those who are alliance and despite all the shit and frustration they get, they keep WM on.<br />
<br />
There is no danger for horde out in the world except NPCs. Its dangerous for alliance players to travel out in the world.</div></div><hr />

I transferred all my characters from PvP servers to PvE servers. I've been on PvP servers for 10 years. I'm done with it. I don't want it. <br />
<br />
This is either<br />
<br />
1) Not going to bring a lot of Alliance players back<br />
or<br />
2) Bring some Alliance players back, but they'll still not enjoy the experience, cause they are just forcing themselves through it for some reward<br />
<br />
In my opinion they should just go back to PvP and PvE servers. I don't really see the point in getting rid of that distinction. Other than giving people a free &quot;transfer&quot; away from whatever type of server they were on. But at least on PvP servers, people were forced to PvP all the time, and it was their own fault if they were on it. Now, people just opt out of that gameplay, which is almost like everyone of a certain faction is leaving the server. Leaving one faction dominant on the &quot;server&quot;. So no one gets what they want.<br />
<br />
what is more sad there is no incentive even if they buff it. what to do this shit for 10% more ap ? they would have to turn it up by what 300-500% for allience now for people to turn it on . <br />

nobody sane will turn warmode on for 30-50 more ap or 10-20 more resources like be real<br />

Yeah, right.<br />
<br />
And even if it makes up for the loss of efficiency you have because of being killed by other players all the time, that still only makes it even, but actually makes the gameplay experience worse.<br />
<br />
And if playing with warmode turned on makes it more efficient, then people will feel forced to have a bad gameplay experience, or they'll lose out if they just want their gameplay experience to be fun.<br />
<br />
Either way this whole system seems irredeemably broken. This is why most people don't like to play on PvP servers. And even the ones that are playing on PvP servers are only doing so cause they picked PvP 10 years ago when they started playing and didn't know what it meant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But as to what Blizz could do to possibly fix the faction imbalance in WM - they could offer scaling rewards. So like Horde gets X % for going WM (10% I think) and maybe Alliance gets 50% rewards for going WM. Then, as more Alliance join that Alliance % goes down, and maybe the Horde one rises, until both are at like 25% extra rewards on average with some spikes or troughs depending on balance.<br />
<br />
I mean, it worked for satchels for dungeons. If there was a tank or healer shortage satchels would be offered as a carrot on a stick to get more tanks/healers to queue up. They could even offer satchels for Alliance characters who queue for WM.</div></div><hr />

Yep right now its just a bonus for the Horde and another incentive to go horde. It will always be this way unless you can get Alliance to turn it on in mass in a very short period of time. The only way to achieve that would be giving very OP rewards that would just create a huge backlash among the horde and alliance who hate pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW already had a &quot;Warmode&quot; for PvE servers, it's called PvP flag. Getting the players to turn this PvP flag, I mean Warmode on is not going to be done with some extra rewards. It's not a job where you increase the pay when nobody wants to work, it's a game and the reward is fun and entertainment. Getting beaten for 20% extra gold it's not going to work.<br />
<br />
The biggest mistake is the way Blizzard split the skills in BfA. Some are Warmode only! Even with Warmode on what do you do in a non-Warmode area?<br />
<br />
Also the 10% reward from Warmode is stupid when it comes to 110-120 leveling. You'll hit lv120 half way in the quest lines and you'll be stuck with crap gear/weapons fighting against lv120 mobs.<br />
<br />
The only fix Blizzard can do is to merge all the Warmode skills into the normal build and throw away the hole thing. It was a bad idea and nothing is going to fix it.</div></div><hr />

Alliance dominated top end pvp because they racials were unbalanced. But that's less than 1% of players who play PVP to the degree that your racials really matter<br />

There's nothing Blizzard can do to make it better aside from really make sure sharding works as intended - other than that, you're agreeing to wpvp, you're gonna get ganked - just turn it off. If you're 120, there is barely any benefit to having it on.</div></div><hr />

How can you balance a situation like the one: in the Brazilian realms, one server (Azralon) has more horde players that the entire alliance in all brazilian realms together(Azralon, Nemesis, Goldrinn, Tol Barad and Gallywix)?<br />
<br />
The main problem is: there are not enough players at the Alliance for balancing, and most of the existing players when using Warmode face Horde Raids - this is not an exceptional happening, it happens all the times!<br />
<br />
Already pointed out, this began in TBC, when blizzard started to neglect the alliance pve side and the faction started to decay since them.</div></div><hr />

Explain how alliance had a 65% win rate on non-rated battlegrounds in that time period then? If it were only &quot;1%&quot; of players, how did they manage to swing 15% win rate on favor of alliance? It's almost like your culture conclusion was completely unfounded and ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I'll even give you like 5% win rate (which is already generous) for pre-nerf every man for himself but what about the other 10%? I guess Alliance had cultural pvp favor or some bullshit then.. lol.<br />
<br />
The reality is that there is no actual overall personality difference between horde or alliance that drives pvp vs not. When it comes down to it a majority of horde players would turn off war mode if there wasn't a 10% bonus, but as it stands they get 10% bonus for effectively nothing. Blizzard already knows this, why do you think the 10% is there?</div></div><hr />

It was equal for many years in the game. The problem stemmed from the horde racials when mythics were released and it took years to finally nerf them. <br />
This is a recent problem. Removing factions would honestly make everyone happy at this point. Maybe let people choose their faction<br />
<br />
you have no idea and no its not a recent problem and for 3 expansions the players were on the alliance side for EMFH, so now that they have the problem on them is a reason to remove factions?, factions is part of what world of warcraft is from his core, you dont want factions? you are playing the wrong game.</div></div><hr />

As horde, I get ganked by a group of alliance pretty much every time I bother to do some wq. Yesterday a group of alliance owned Naz'mir for quite awhile.<br />
<br />
This morning a clever warlock was by a good wq and dotting people up, knowing they'd get creamed 1v1 vs anyone, but they had a group of rogue buddies that opened up on anyone taking the bait. I don't attack alliance 1v1 since they always melt and half the time they attack first they follow up by making an alt to pst cry about how unfair it is that mages have toolkits that can kite away, but I took this bait.<br />
<br />
And my thought after getting clobbered by rogues? Well played clever warlock, well played.<br />
<br />
So you guys with wm off making assumptions, please stop. You don't play with wm on so you're clueless. There was a group of alliance fighting in Zuldazar, the horde capital, all morning as well. Every day too I see solo alliance hanging out waiting for respawns at wq that have 2-3 other horde at them. Seems like about 1 out of 3 times someone decides to kill them, but rarely does anyone jump in. They don't need to. 1v1 is always just fine, so a lot of alliance are crying wolf about just getting 1v1'd while they happened to see other unfriendly nameplates in the background.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. The problem isn’t sharding, the problem is that they didn’t drastically reduce the number of realms 5 years ago. There should only be about 10 us realms. If they did that, cross realm stuff would be unnecessary and you’d have actual servers that mattered. Sharding would actually help in that situation because it provides a solution for the start of expansion influx.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They HAD the idea, at the start, for increased wPVP - incursions. Have incursions flip warmode on for everyone, that zone is wPVP for the duration - and don't make it stupid long, like 6-8 hours, and it travels across both islands randomly, like hotspots in a war popping up randomly. Put things into incursions with rewards. Problem solved. <br />
<br />
They could have even played it into the story, with them starting more randomly and spread out, building up over the course of the expansion. Leading to some Wintergrasp type zone, where each side dukes it out for mounts, or something. <br />
<br />
It's puzzling, that for all of the creative power in the company, all of the decisions for BfA have been bad, dull, boring, half-baked, wrong, or just dumb. <br />
<br />
In any other company, I would put Ion's chances at still being employed there by 9.0 at 50/50, but Blizzard doesn't seem to fire people except in extreme cases, and they all are just seemingly institutionally tin eared and so high up in their ivory towers, that they'll reward Ion for his fuck ups, instead of seeing him as the crux of the problems. Ion will probably be there in the future when they shutter the doors in Irvine, and he'll babble to everyone &quot;We need to be better!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Seriously, where is the sport in dropping down off of a flying mount to 1 shot people 90 levels lower than you are? They should have made it like AION did back in the day to both make leveling viable in PvP areas and allow for low levels to hold their own against those that would come and hammer them in one hit. Sure, they could still roll in with a group of 15 and smash your face, but the single griefing dbags stopped playing entirely when the low levels could hand them their asses.</div></div><hr />

Ion will probably be there in the future when they shutter the doors in Irvine, and he'll babble to everyone &quot;We need to be better!&quot;<br />
<br />
This Ion kid would have no chance in any other industry. He is an incompetent trash. His non-verbal communications show that he is a psychopath too.</div></div><hr />

Say 1000 horde and 50 alliance has warmode on.<br />
They put 1 shard with 50 alliance and 50 horde.<br />
Then all the other 950 horde gets a shard without alliance and free 10% reward bonus.<br />
<br />
Great system...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc29e4727ea9</div><div class="date">2018-11-16, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the shards actually work like they say they do now, there should be LOADS of shards with only horde in them and 0 alliance since the number of horde players with WM on compared to the number of alliance players with WM on must be very imbalanced right now.<br />
<br />
I would take a stab in the dark and guess that about 4 of 5 shards are completely free of alliance and contain only horde.<br />
<br />
The problem with this system is that horde players that wants to pvp will create pvp groups/raids started by players that happen to be inside shards that contain alliance, to complete their pvp weekly quests or just farm honor. So the few alliance that actually have WM on will almost always face horde in groups or raids that are in that shard just to kill alliance players, they don't care about the world quests.<br />
<br />
Example: Wednesday on EU whole Stormsong area was pretty much a no-go zone for alliance in the evening because of the ganking horde raids created. There were a horde raid going for hours that ran between the west azerite WQ location and the alliance flight master back and forth. It's incredibly hard as alliance to create a raid to counter this, because that means that basically every single alliance that exists in that shard has to join the raid. That is very unlikely to happen. I went to stormsong on 4 different alliance characters and all of them got placed vs the same horde raid, so it seems it was either the only alliance shard up for the moment, or I got extremely unlucky.<br />
<br />
The only way to fix this is to place players inside a raid in their own shard so they only see other raid grouped players. Sure you will still have 5man ganking groups but atleast that is easier to deal with. A 40 man raid running around slaughtering everyone is almost impossible to deal with for alliance players right now there are simply too few players, atleast on EU.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given how much they love to talk about how outnumbered the Horde are and what scrappy underdogs they are...<br />
<br />
It should just work like BG. If there are too many Horde for Warmode, they just cant turn it on. Enjoy your 500 hour queue hoping some Alliance turn it on. <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Reroll Alliance and turn it on yourself.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tttsssrrr</div><div class="date">2018-11-16, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard was so afraid of backlash from finally nerfing Arcane Torrent that they made a Raid encounter perfectly suited for it and then wonder why Horde has an almost 10% higher population of level 120s than the Alliance does. That catering attitude to the largest section of your player base is why things will never really get fixed, despite all of Blizzard's talk about it.</div></div><hr />
