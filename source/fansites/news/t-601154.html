Yup, you can now import models from the Armory. 
 
If you're interested, you can get my custom npcs.csv here, it doesn't change much things, it just adds most of the Karazhan bosses and Serpentshrine bosses to the NPC list (File &gt; View NPC), Lady Vashj model is available in the Creature &gt; Ladyvashj directory, the Lurker Below is just above and is named Krakken." />

Can now automatically import characters from Blizzards armory site by goto Options -&gt; Import Armoury Character and pasting the URL. Please note that character specifics line hair style, skin/hair colour, etc are not imported. Just Race / Gender / Items.<br />
Pushing Control+F1-F3 now temporarilly saves a models poisition, rotation, and the Field of View at the time. To restore this data you can do so by pushing F1-F3 without Control.<br />
