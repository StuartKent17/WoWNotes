<br />
A portal into Warcraft history has ripped open, and the fifth World of Warcraft expansion has been revealed! Warlords of Draenor sends players to the savage world of Draenor—home of the mighty orcs and haven of the mystic draenei—to fight against and alongside legends from Warcraft’s brutal past.<br />
<br />
Amid Draenor’s untamed jungles and battle-scarred plains, a merciless new Iron Horde has been forged from the mighty orc clans of old. To save their own world from impending invasion, Azeroth’s heroes will need to explore the far reaches of this unforgiving land, achieving new heights of power on their way to the new level cap of 100. To establish a foothold on Draenor, players will construct, command, and expand their own Garrison, a customizable base of operations and refuge for the followers you recruit to your desperate cause. Warlords of Draenor also empowers players to instantly boost one character to level 90, making it so anyone can join the battle for Draenor alongside their friends.<br />

Should have let Thrall smash his skull when he had the chance. Siege of Orgrimmar must NOT be setback, no more Garrosh as raid encounter. No more setbacks ffs! Ever.<br />
Warlords of Draenor, hello, they've been defeated, they're dead. Some more than once, Nerz'hul aka Lich King, the king of setbacks, seen that killed it, <br />
We know the world of Draenor is gone, so after patch 6.5 what? We gonna fight Illidan and his setbacker Kael'thas again for when they start their reign, WoW 7.0 Burning Crusade 3.0. Storywise the point is to show new wow players the history what happened before World of Warcraft, humans vs orcs, mmmyeah, i've got 5 word solution, one Caverns of time _dungeon_, that's it, not an entire expansion.The world should move forward not backward, -&gt; Sargeras / roll WoW end credits.<br />
<br />
Well, people wanted Outland redone, congrats and have a nice trip on memory lane, that creeping feeling on your back in the &quot;new&quot; continent, it's called nostalgia and it's goggles are ugly to wear. The gameplay would have to be pretty god damn innovative, amazing and dazzling (talking story level of first time read of Lord of the rings) for me to return to hellhole called Outland/Draenor.<br />

fyi, that's not me flying to Outland.<br />
<br />
World of Setback patch 6.0, thank you for liberating me.<br />
So extremely dissappointed.<br />
Wanted one thing, to fight Sargeras, now they got a whole line of expansions lined up, guess it won't happen anytime soon.. next 10 years.<br />
So i guess i'll be back when the Dark Titan shows up, waiting for my 10 char boost to lvl 150 and premade for Sargeras.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did this for Pandaria as well when it was announced, too. This is just the rough overview of story, and what's being added. The CGI cinematic will come out much closer to when this expansion is released.<br />
<br />
That being said? Looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

Towards the end when they were showing them marching onto BT looked like a total rip off of HP: DH 2<br />

<br />
Well, it didn't catch me either. Some cut scenes from chars fighting each other...no story. Pretty much retro compared to the last ones. The only scene that made me feel something was the last one....<br />
<br />
The Heroes of the Storm cinematic isn't much better. It lost me when the girl showed up from being cloaked...then caught me with the first fight(Tyrael vs. Queen...cool) just to lose me again with the next 2 fights(Diablo vs. a gun and a nuke? Seriously? A cool helmet, a sexy girl and an &quot;oh shit&quot; just don't cut it for me)...not to mention that the music got annoying with some cheap arcade sounds just at that moment.<br />
<br />
I have to say that Blizz did much better already...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, they lost me when she showed up. I was like &quot;wait...theres NO &quot;good guy&quot; Warcraft character in this fight? They put in TWO starcraft ones?&quot; And then the Arthas sword slowdown moment..... /gag. Its bad enough when blizzard rehashes game content...but now their cinematic films? lol.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soeroah</div><div class="date">2013-11-09, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't wait. This looks like it'll probably be my favourite one so far. <br />
<br />
My only grievance is I was hoping Garrosh wouldn't be such a large part of the next expansion. Hopefully he gets killed off quickly. Other than that, I love seeing how things look different in different time periods/dimensions, and so many quality-of-life changes and additions? <br />
<br />
Lovely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're confusing the trailer and the reveal. MoP used in-game footage for its reveal too. We didn't even see the cinematic until shortly before launch. New around here, I assume?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The only good side of this is that my favourite alliance race is getting some screen time. If they won't be overhelmed by orcs of course.<br />
<br />
And that trailer is probably the worst 'cinematic' I've ever seen. Well, maybe they'll show us something better later but I wouldn't count on it.</div></div><hr />
