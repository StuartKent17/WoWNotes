Yesterday you had a sneak peek at the Firelands Daily Area (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2202-Firelands-Daily-Area-Preview-Blizzard-Anniversary-Video-MMO-Report-Comics), it's time to take a look at the only thing you all want to see: the Firelands Raid instance! <br />
<br />
Just like the daily area, it's a little hard to gather a lot of information about it because the instance isn't even supposed to be in this PTR patch but hopefully the couple of screenshots/maps below will be enough while you wait a few more months (you could probably count in weeks, Patch 4.2 won't be far behind Patch 4.1) before you see it on live realms. <br />

Firelands Raid - Encounters<br />
According to the Blizzcon 2010 Raids &amp; Dungeons Panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2034-Blizzcon-2010-Raids-Dungeons-Panel-Press-Trailer), the Firelands raid will have 7 bosses. We already know 3 of them from achievement icones:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fandral Staghelm (http://www.wowpedia.org/Fandral_Staghelm), former Archdruid of Darnassus.<br />
Alysra (http://www.wowpedia.org/Alysra), the green drake in charge of transporting Fandral to a safe location at the end of the Hyjal questlines in Cataclysm. (Note: Just because there's an icon related to Alysra doesn't mean it's really a boss, in the case of Valithria Dreamwalker (http://www.wowpedia.org/Valithria_Dreamwalker) the goal of the encounter was to save her)<br />
Ragnaros the Firelord (http://www.wowpedia.org/Ragnaros), that one isn't really a surprise, right? And he's so pretty now! (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/february/ragnaros2.jpg)<br />

PvP Video - Reckful 3<br />
If you ever watched PvP videos you probably know who Reckful is, Reckful 3 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU8pOwuqt3k) was released yesterday and I strongly suggest that you watch it, even if you don't like PvP that much in the first place. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Blizzard Retrospective Video<br />
If you didn't watch the Blizzard retrospective video posted on the official site yesterday because you didn't have time or didn't feel like watching it, it is now available on Youtube. I think a lot of people didn't realize it's a huge 48 minutes documentary and if you ever played a Blizzard game, you'll like it. <br />

To reveal new stuff from the game... But I would bet that patch 4.2 is not to come in near future. Does it mean there's not much to see in patch 4.1? Blizzard is really milking this game...</div></div><hr />

notice in the last screen shot, what do you see...YES that is it! it is a pool of fire in the middle of the platform (much like the sunwell eh?).

<br />
The firelands wasn't delayed. That's a miscomception of people not understanding blizzards post right. They didn't quite word original post right and clarified later. Firelands went from patch 4.1 to 4.2 because blizz decided they wanted to release 4.1 early with filler content and balance stuff right away. 4.2 is still going to come out when 4.1 originally would have. Of course they had already deemed upcoming patch 4.1 so it was too late to say &quot;it's 4.0.8 now&quot;. Although if they continue this progressionary path of more content in between major raids, i doubt they will call it 4.3. Probably 4.2.2 or something. So i don't expect to be fighting deathwing in 4.8 heh.</div></div><hr />

Well, probably it's because many people don't see all the things he does. He is an amazing rogue no doubt but all the things he got going makes it very hard to see everything that is going on. Watch his control movie where he explains in detail how he plays and then I believe you will enjoy his new movie alot more.</div></div><hr />

Well, OBVIOUSLY we would have turned into a boss, one way or another. Ysera already mentioned in Hyjal that Fandral's change of location during the invasion of the Twilight Hammer Clan up there not the wisest decision was.<br />

The reason that vid made front page is because Reckful is without a doubt the best rogue in WoW, and his vids are a big thing. More display of skill than any pve kill anyway. Freaking incredible</div></div><hr />

Erm because they're not SPECIAL enough to receive their own unique model since they are not main lore characters.<br />
Those were probably consider as 'foot soldiers'-type dragons. <br />
Besides there are a few unique dragon models, so not ALL the dragons look alike. Eg, Kalec, Aspects, DEATHWING &gt;.&gt;<br />

I didn't even knew what happened in those fights half of the time, since it was so fast and flashy - Not to mention that i don't even know what Reckful is exactly doing there in the first place as i am not 100% familiar with the class at all.<br />

<br />
The casual viewers are exposed to world first/hardmode kills all of the time but I doubt very very much that many of the 'casual viewers' are at that level either. I'll admit that it is difficult most of the time to catch everything happening in top-tier arena vids, especially reckful seeing as he does so many things at once and so quickly, but that doesn't mean the movie is dull, just the person watching and not understanding.<br />
<br />

PVP and PVE are apples and oranges...and no, I don't particularly care to hear the old &quot;FIGHTING AGAINST REAL PEOPLE!&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
If you make a mistake against a real person in PVP, you can recover. On the hardest of PVE encounters, a mistake can kill you and your entire raid on the spot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duster505</div><div class="date">2011-03-09, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Blizzard Retrospective video was very intresting one. I have to say that I was never a big BLizzard fan before WOW. Warcraft or Starcraft were not for me and even if I played Diablo - it wasn't anything special. WOW on the other hand was. In my eyes its the greatest single game ever to have launched. Its such an achivement to be able to create something that feels so huge - is so playable and so social. It turned a grind into enjoyment compared to the MMOs before it. <br />
<br />
There was one point in the video that really put things into perspective for me. When they were talking about second wave of developers (team 2) coming in after the orginal launch and how tha brought new engergy to the game. I personally think that this team is what made WOW what it is today. TBC expansion took WOW forward. It added new elements into the game that were so awsome - like flying that they made feel sooo great and so natural. And thats what WOW is all about. Fluency. Totay you play games like RIFT that are stuck in the 5 year old hell of slowing ppl down movement wise - just to make the world feel bigger. Its horrible. I felt like I was back playing EQ2 at launch. What a total and utter nightmare.<br />
<br />
But I think Blizzard did what most other current MMO makers failed to do. They took their MMO forward by adding sooo much to it. Compare that to the so called next sets of big MMos like AOC and WAR ... that never did anything more than just fix the broken crap they sent out a launch.. followed with &quot;packs&quot; and &quot;expansion patches&quot;. <br />
<br />
But there is a negative point to this all for WOW. Blizzard has started talking WOW down like they know the game is coming to an end. They are trying to switch focus to new game. Even if that happens in 4-5 years ... it still makes ppl realise that devs are not thinking of moving WOW forward anymore. THey are stagnant and are not putting money into improving the game engine to take it to next big level. Thats really negative cause an online game SHOULD be able to grow with the population. It should be able to add new systems like dyes on armor and more custimisation. Its not...<br />
<br />
And that is the sign that Bizzard is no longer company of gamers creating games for the gamers. WOW playerbase doesn't want to be told that WOW is ending and they should move on to FPS MMO. BUt thats exactly what BLizzard is saying atm. And going for FPS MMO ... no thank you. <br />
<br />
THere will be a new giant in the MMO industry in few years time. Its inevatable cause current WOW dev team is running out of ideas to take the game forward. Or at least they are just doing the same old because they are now milking money instead of creating something fresh that the gamers want to see in the CURRENT game they are playing. Blizzard is actually KILLING the whole concept of online RPG game cause they are not intrested in keeping WOW evolving for their subscribers.<br />
<br />
It was inevatable this would happen. Blizzard is no longer the company that borrowed money from family to create quality games with the focus on gameplay. THey are a buisness first and foremost thinking about profits rather than the games they are creating. The Cataclysm expansion is porbably the best proof if it. It brings absolutly zero new into the game in terms of gameplay and online enjoyment. If something they actually did exactly the oposite by sticking old method dungeon design into LFD tool and expect ppl that never played together before to be able to hit if off from first pull.<br />
<br />
WOW feels stagnant at this point. Its not because the game can not move forward. Its because the developers have desided they are not gonna move the game forward. Its stuck in a mold that will die really fast in the next 2-3 years. There is no Burning Crusade innovating expansion coming ... There is no new dungeon format coming.. no new and more intresting AI. No more custimisable characters or armors. There is no Team 2 anymore... Its not because WOW fans are not gonna be supporting it. NO.. its because the developers are no longer thinking as the gamers ... they are thinking about something totally diffrent. <br />
<br />
And that will kill Blizzard like it did to so many other gaming developers. The big name companies that were giants when BLizzard were starting - most of them are gone because they did exactly the same thing BLizzard is doing now... its a pattern of buisness rather than games. Today we got new companies making games the same way BLizzard did 20 years ago. Small crew creating their own dreams and enjoying it. Look at Magicka for example - awsome game mecanics made fun. BLizzard has lost this now. Starcraft 2 is probably the best proof of it. Long cinematics... same gameplay .. The creatativity of BLizzard has died. If they are thinking about creating FPS MMO as the next big thing and let WOW rot like it looks like..... then they will die even faster than former giants of the industry died in the past 20 years.</div></div><hr />

They certainly handle it better than i would. By now i would have just given the community the double finger, said &quot;You can all go F yourselves&quot; and go back to developing and releasing three of the hottest and best selling ip's ever.</div></div><hr />

Dude, I understand completely. It's like dealing with people who think &quot;Nascar? Herp derp going in circles!&quot;<br />

Either way, the pvp in this game is stale (not that PvE Isn't getting there). When the (supposed) new BG maps hit, it may re-interest me.. But as it is, Arenas are still class comp dominated, and boring.</div></div><hr />

I'm interested in this, because I haven't seen anything about it - I've heard a lot of people talk about how &quot;clearly&quot; all the good devs are elsewhere, but nothing from Blizzard suggesting a change of tactic. It would be a little odd for them to be honest, to start talking down their bigger-than-god game in favour of one that they haven't finished making yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
THey are stagnant and are not putting money into improving the game engine to take it to next big level.<br />
<br />
Dude, they have just rebuilt the world from the ground up! Including reworking the entire class system, adding a new profession, new starting and level cap zones... what more are you expecting?

WOW playerbase doesn't want to be told that WOW is ending and they should move on to FPS MMO. BUt thats exactly what BLizzard is saying atm.<br />
<br />
Okay - where exactly are they saying this?<br />
<br />
<br />
THey are a buisness first and foremost thinking about profits rather than the games they are creating.<br />
<br />
I don't see how this works with them trying to scare people off their biggest game, to be honest.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm expansion is porbably the best proof if it. It brings absolutly zero new into the game in terms of gameplay and online enjoyment. If something they actually did exactly the oposite by sticking old method dungeon design into LFD tool and expect ppl that never played together before to be able to hit if off from first pull.<br />
<br />
While LFD isn't without problems, I don't see how these are new to Cataclysm (apart from the dungeons actually being challenging pre-4.2)</div></div><hr />

Yeah I thought Deepholm's 'ceiling' would be far, far higher than it ended up being. The concept art with Deathwing also made it look as though there was a city or castle-town of some sort that wasn't there either. I always forget the zone exists too since you can't travel to it.<br />

Reckful IS an awesome rogue, though watching his video made me realize how overpowered sub rogue were. I mean, who can seriously follow a target feared in order to sap as soon as he gets out of combat ? Every other melee class would have trouble getting back to melee range. Sublety rogues are actually practically unkillable, they also have too much damage/burst/mobility, they're too complete. Which is for me the definition of OP (outside of classes having retarded damages such as current arms warriors, rets during cooldowns, shadowpriests..). They have no weakness(es).<br />
<br />
PS : Something that shocked me, why didn't these teams, that are the top team of US-Bloodlust, which is said to be the best US BG, and even the best BG in the world, get a cc (just like a hoj/gnaw or anything else really) on Reckful while he was following a feared target in order to get a sap on him ? They could at least have kept him in combat (he could have vanished yeah but that would have forced him to use a cooldown to get a sap, I'm pretty sure he simply restealthed when he went for a sap on a feared target)...</div></div><hr />

Watch the video again from 46 min to end... Not one word about WOW future ... the focus in on their other games. The focus is on how BLizzard can get players from WOW into the other games they are making. Not one single word about taking WOW to the next level of future MMO style game. Not 1 word.<br />
<br />
About your points that Cataclysm rebuilt the old world... No it did not. It changed quests to make them more linear. It didn't really change anything other than fix some dead wood quests areas that ppl didn't like. They didn't graphically enhance the entire old world - only about 1/3rd of it so we know what is gonna be happening in the next 4 years of WOW. <br />
<br />
The rework of the Talent system failed.... the game is very unbalanced during the lvling curve. But we know that they changed the talent trees not for the gamers.. they did it to simplify their work of balancing. IF you ask most of the GAMERS that are playing WOW they will tell you that they dont want PVP and PVE to influnece each other as much as it has for the last 5 years. Blizzard ignored them and instead created MORE linear stuff in the talent trees. Just like they did with the questsystem. <br />
<br />
And again ... Blizzard is not thinking about WOW anymore as their forefront of game development. THats a total and utter disgrace considering that they have huge subscriberbase that WANT this game to grow and strenghten. Blizzard should be aiming for keeping the WOW base intrested in WOW. But like they said themselfs in this interview... they are gonna try to get them to new game cause if not.. some other company will do it. SInce when it a goal of a company to say that they want their playerbase of the biggest MMO game ever to go play another MMO rather than strengthen the game that ppl have been supporting for years ?<br />
<br />
WOW is an evolving online game. The next step in WOW is for the developers to make the game GROW with the fanbase. Thats what WOW has ignored in Cataclysm. Thats what is so obviously lacking for the future vision of WOW. The goal is no longer to go do great things with WOW. And that is a total disgrace.<br />
<br />
We know its coming - We heard it from the developers. We see it in Cataclysm. There is alot of dead wood going on atm and very little creativity other than the same old same old. This is just a fact that BLizzard is no longer hiding.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunently I see this sort of uninformed opinion as having a small following in the community. The issue is (and has always been since their inception) the fact that the majority of significant backstory lore occurs in the Warcraft novels. So someone like this would not see or understand the corruption of Fandral or any of the events that led to him being held captive in Hyjal. Yes the NPCs do sort of fill you in during the initial Hyjal questline, but hey not everyone reads even the quests they complete.<br />
<br />
In short, yes it makes sense that Fandral would be a raid boss. Hell I expected him to be a questline boss similar to Ragnaros in Hyjal so this is really a nod in his importance. And as Boub said we likely have to save the Green. Not unlike Valithria in Wrath, whom we didnt kill either. But again if you can't or refuse to read quest and npc text I guess you might have assumed she exploded after hitting 100%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do make a good point. The funny part is that &quot;the ultimate test of skill&quot; can't be pinned down by one group or another. Those that PvE can't say with 100% certainty that PvE is the end-all-be-all of WoW. Those that PvP can't say with 100% certainty that people who PvE are scrubs. But, one thing you can be certain of, is that this game runs on the lore and PvE aspects it brings.</div></div><hr />

I mean, of all the times they've ever given in to the demands and QQ's for some of the more ridiculous things they've done in WoW, you would think that the impopularity of their new design on one of the most epic raid bosses in the history of forever would somehow give them a hint. Right? 0_o<br />

<br />
It's a derogatary term on players who are unable to addapt to pvp situations. It steems from the the conception that pvp players don't think it's as challangeing to beat or clear raid bosses as they value the skill of beating other people as the most important and skillfull thing to do. So when a person is unable to beat other people they are a &quot;pve hero&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you ask most of the &quot;gamers&quot; that are playing WoW, they want their classes to be uber-gods who can roflstomp all the other classes, they want more realistic models, no more fantastic models, no more polygons, no less polygons cause my system sucks, no.... Blizzard doesn't ignore the community, but they don't don't let the community design the game either. Just becasue you don't like the changes doesn't mean they aren't good changes, or that they were well thought out and well implemented changes, or anything else. A *lot* of effort went into Catclysm. Do you realize that even in the areas that didn't change at all, they had to remodel almost everything? Most of the world didn't have full 3-d models. They only full modeled the stuff we could see. If you couldn't get there overland, or see it from a flight point trip, the model probably didn't have a top potion at all. That's why you couldn't fly in Azeroth before now. It's also why they were always stingy as Hell with putting in new Old World Flight points. There was a lot of modeling work that went in every time they added one. <br />
<br />
The amount of effort that went into completely redesigning the talent system (whether you like the result or not) and completely remodeling the old world (with a completely new zone design or finishing out exist models) is staggering. It's not the sort of thing you do for a game you're planing to EOL.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
WoW has never been Blizzard's only game, but by chance or design, it was the only game they released for few years. There was a ton of behind the scenes effort being put into DIII and SCII during those times, but you didn't see it becasue those games weren't slated for release. Now that they are, or are close to, released, you're seeing the effort that's been going on for years. The &quot;emphasis&quot; hasn't changed, it's just that you're seeing results. Blizz isn't ignoring WoW for their new properties, you just didn't know how much effort was or wasn't being put into those properties all along.<br />
<br />
<br />
WOW is an evolving online game. The next step in WOW is for the developers to make the game GROW with the fanbase. Thats what WOW has ignored in Cataclysm. Thats what is so obviously lacking for the future vision of WOW. The goal is no longer to go do great things with WOW. And that is a total disgrace.<br />
<br />
They rebuilt the whole damned world for you and changed the play style of almost every class. Sorry it doesn't meet with your approval, but it's hardly an indication that the game is being ignored. You just personally don't like the changes. <br />
<br />
<br />
We know its coming - We heard it from the developers. We see it in Cataclysm. There is alot of dead wood going on atm and very little creativity other than the same old same old. This is just a fact that BLizzard is no longer hiding.<br />
<br />
There's not a lack of creativity, there's you being tired of the same game. It's inevitable. You've been playing for 3, 4, 5 years. Short of making the game a completely different game there's probably nothing Blizzard can do to make you happy. Nothing stays fresh forever.</div></div><hr />

If you make a mistake against a real person in PVP, you can recover. On the hardest of PVE encounters, a mistake can kill you and your entire raid on the spot.<br />

The things that made it tremendous were the pop culture references and the individuals like Leeroy and Dives who made their little memes we still hear about everyday... I still don't believe it was successful because it was good, it was only successful because of luck. That, and bigger things just get bigger. It retained popularity by preserving the non-gamers by making everything so easy.<br />
<br />
Um, WoW was/is successful because it IS good.<br />
Why has no other MMO been able to take WoW from the top of the pedestal? Because they aren't near as good.<br />
<br />
Successful because of luck? To what luck are you referring? Lucky that they have an amazing team at Blizzard? Lucky because they care about the games they make? Lucky because they know (for the most part) what they are doing? Lucky because they continually try to make the game better (even though people will always complain about something).<br />
<br />
Tremendous because of pop culture references? lol? Lets think about this for a second. So, you're saying that people started playing the game because they heard there were lots of pop culture references, then told others to play because of the cool pop culture references, then Blizzard advertised and tried to sell the game based on the amount of pop culture references there were. Um, ok, if you say so.<br />
<br />
Luck, totally...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally accept PvP as an important facet of WoW but not one large enough for those focused on it to completely scoff those that don't PvP.<br />
<br />
WoW doesn't come from W3. It's comes after W3, in story. WoW continues the story. Also, to claim W3 was &quot;mostly&quot; a pvp game is based on your opinion. The game was never shipped as &quot;Hey! COME PVP! And do some pve on the side&quot;. It's a PvE game with the ability of PvP play. A large portion of the community that plays W3 (still) PvPs over the PvE (or at least that's what I assume, I stopped playing W3 a long time ago).<br />
<br />
The main focus of the Warcraft series of games (also Diablo and Starcraft) is Blizzard's ability to tell the story; the characters, the environment, the lore. WoW was made for us, the PLAYERs, to interact with the ENVIRONMENT. Once again, WoW is a PvE with the ability for players to PvP. You will rarely see something like this &quot;Introducing patch 5.3 Arena Season 15! Oh and a new raid tier&quot; But you will see &quot;Patch 5.3: The Return of Sargeras! oh and season 15 starts when we release the raid&quot; <br />
<br />
Should Blizzard ignore PvP? No way. Should people who don't know the first thing about PvP say that video was boring? No way. Because, it's actually a very good video. Should those that PvP call those that PvE names and act the way they have been in this thread and over at AJ? Nope. Because, once again, this is all over pixels.</div></div><hr />

MLG dropped it cause it wasn't fun to watch. Some find it fun to play... but most do it just because of gear. So.. that they can pown some none as geared players. <br />
<br />
I think BLizzard needs to refocus their PVP content. RIft is doing it by making a special PVP tree that you need to have active to be able to pvp. Thats one way of doing it and we will see what Rift players think of it in few months time. I still consider it to be a mistake from BLizzard to spend time redesigning the talent trees and still have both pvp and PVE to balance in each tree. PVE and PVP should not be mixed in WOW. Thats what 90% of the population have agreed on when PVP was put into the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2011-03-09, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MLG was dumb to pick it up in the first place. <br />
<br />
Something that is so radical random and not 1:1 balanced can not be competitive to begin with. If I had to describe WOW PvP I'd use &quot;70% luck, 30% skill (was typo before :D)&quot;. Competitive games are games that are balanced 1:1, RTS, FPS and similar games, where everyone is on equal terms and knows exactly what his next &quot;attack&quot; will do damage wise, not wait for the game to decide that he missed, or was dodged and what not, or that he was extremely lucky and got a 60k crit, while there was always a chance that it would only hit for 6k. Having equal gear still means shit, if the underlying basics are still randomly calculated on each spell cast. <br />
<br />
When MLG picked WOW as the competitive game everyone knew it's a farce really.<br />
<br />
That said, PvP is fun, very fun and you have people that are really really good at it, but in the end it's just way to random, like I wrote above, and random numbers poping up can turn the scenario in favor of someone, who didn't do anything special at all, but the game did it for him.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duster505</div><div class="date">2011-03-09, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a retrospective? I'm shocked. Shocked. Here I thought &quot;retrospective&quot; meant &quot;all about the future.&quot; <br />
<br />
You obviosly lost the part where BLizzard were talking about the future in the last few mins...<br />
<br />
<br />
If you ask most of the &quot;gamers&quot; that are playing WoW, they want their classes to be uber-gods who can roflstomp all the other classes, they want more realistic models, no more fantastic models, no more polygons, no less polygons cause my system sucks, no.... Blizzard doesn't ignore the community, but they don't don't let the community design the game either. Just becasue you don't like the changes doesn't mean they aren't good changes, or that they were well thought out and well implemented changes, or anything else. A *lot* of effort went into Catclysm. Do you realize that even in the areas that didn't change at all, they had to remodel almost everything? Most of the world didn't have full 3-d models. They only full modeled the stuff we could see. If you couldn't get there overland, or see it from a flight point trip, the model probably didn't have a top potion at all. That's why you couldn't fly in Azeroth before now. It's also why they were always stingy as Hell with putting in new Old World Flight points. There was a lot of modeling work that went in every time they added one. <br />
<br />
THey did not complete remodel anything... go read the inerviews that were taken with BLizzard devs in GDC 11. THey talked about doing 1/3 rd of the game in Cataclysm. And if you fly over places like felwood you will see how your &quot;total remodel&quot; is just bull.<br />
<br />
<br />
The amount of effort that went into completely redesigning the talent system (whether you like the result or not) and completely remodeling the old world (with a completely new zone design or finishing out exist models) is staggering. It's not the sort of thing you do for a game you're planing to EOL.<br />
<br />
I dont find it staggering.. I find it very badly done and will not stand the test of time over the next 5-6 years. They needed to do alot more and do it alot better to actually make the game stick for the future. They didn't. Nothing staggering about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW has never been Blizzard's only game, but by chance or design, it was the only game they released for few years. There was a ton of behind the scenes effort being put into DIII and SCII during those times, but you didn't see it becasue those games weren't slated for release. Now that they are, or are close to, released, you're seeing the effort that's been going on for years. The &quot;emphasis&quot; hasn't changed, it's just that you're seeing results. Blizz isn't ignoring WoW for their new properties, you just didn't know how much effort was or wasn't being put into those properties all along.<br />
<br />
Yes they are ignoring WOW for the new games- their goal is to get subs from WOW to go into their new games. Go watch the last few mins again - somehow you seemed to have missed all of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
They rebuilt the whole damned world for you and changed the play style of almost every class. Sorry it doesn't meet with your approval, but it's hardly an indication that the game is being ignored. You just personally don't like the changes. <br />
<br />
No they did not rebuilt the whole game - they did 1/3rd. They did not change the playstyle of most of the classes - they just created a way for them to balance it very easily. And I never said I didn't like the changes. I said they are doing a very poor job considering the support that the game is getting from the playerbase.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There's not a lack of creativity, there's you being tired of the same game. It's inevitable. You've been playing for 3, 4, 5 years. Short of making the game a completely different game there's probably nothing Blizzard can do to make you happy. Nothing stays fresh forever.<br />
<br />
Yes there is a MAJOR lack of creativity in the WOW development team atm. With a &quot;total&quot; rewamp of the old world (like you claim) they should have worked on the future systems that will become major part of every MMO - Heck that ALREADY has become a major part of every MMO. That would include more custimisation of character and look + armor. That would also involve adding more variety to mobs - improving the engine so that everything doesn't look exactly the same from lvl 1 to lvl 85. Thats something that BLizzard should have been working on IF they were REALLY doing a total rewamp of the old world. THey just didn't. They changed few maps. Rest is left but ugly like felwood.<br />
<br />
Im very dissapointed in the way BLizzard is now JUST thinking on how they can end WOW gracefully - instead of taking the game forward to move it from 12 mills to 20 mills. The potential is there IF they were intrested. THey are not. They are just going to spend their broadband capacity on another game - trying to get WOW players to play some other of their games. And no - thats not what WOW players should take lightly and quietly.</div></div><hr />

I very much like Reckful and consider rogue one of the most well-designed, balanced and actually fun classes in the game. I also like to watch skillful players in pvp videos as much as the next person, but why on earth would showing a random pvp comp's matches deserve space on MMO's front-page?!<br />
<br />
There are so much better events and videos that have occurred recently which show skill and perserverence against the odds. This is including but not limited to Mionelol's solo of Yogg-Saron or even Reckful's Warglaives matches which were at least fun, usual and show off his skill.<br />
<br />
If the purpose was to show off the strength of a pvp comp as to somehow indicate is so much better than other comps, well you're WAY off the mark. There are so many incredibly powerful comps, many of which are not even that well known, including top hunter comps and, the usual suspects, semi-faceroll dk comps (which oddly enough hunter comps seem to counter quite hard).<br />
<br />
If the purpose was to show off Reckful or increase his exposure and revenues because he is a professional gamer (i.e. earns money based from sponsers) and a friend, then obviously that would seem at best &quot;unhealthy&quot; to most people.<br />

The problem, if any, is not at Blizzard - it is the community growing &quot;older&quot; (as in - having played the game for longer). This happens with any persistent game world or similar: The longer something exists, the more legacy matters to the community, the less room for &quot;Hey, we got this great new idea that will upset everything you thought you knew&quot;. At some point, which WoW is already past, the community becomes an obstacle to implementing creativity. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You are forgetting one important factor: Blizzard is a company. As such, their main objective is making products that makes as much money for the shareholders as possible. There is no way Blizzard folks are telling their Activision (and other) owners: Hey, we're bored of making tons of money through the product we KNOW is working with customers, so we're gonna fold it as fast as we can and spend all our money on a cool new project that no one knows if it is going to be a flop or success. <br />
<br />
Things just don't work like that in the coprporate world. I'll tell you how it works:<br />
<br />
Blizz devs: &quot;We'd like to invest in this new awesome future project, we can do cool new stuff there that the legacy of WoW is not allowing us to, we're all excited about it here!&quot;<br />
Money guys: &quot;Cool, just make sure WoW remains a cash cow for as long as it can possibly be, and stay on budget for the risky new stuff&quot;<br />
Blizz devs: &quot;Er... we were thinking just shutting down WoW and tell our customers to go to this other new shiny thing instead&quot;<br />
Money guys: &quot;Forget that. We're happy to see you invest in the next cash cow, but as long as there is a subscriber base for WoW, you ARE going to deliver regular expansion packs that generate tons of money for us, and keep an as large subscriber base as humanly possible. Then at some future point, if indeed the Shiny New Thing turns out a success so big we don't need WoW anymore, then we can possibly discuss folding WoW gracefully, but that's going to be at earliest 5-10 years from now&quot;</div></div><hr />

I suggest you watch the retrospective video that was posted in this very thread. There, you will discovery that WoW and Wc3 were kinda developed side by side. Maybe WoW started a bit later, but it doesn't really matter because they spent 5 years on WoW and therefore launched later.<br />
Now, look back to WoW launch. Tell me, how much pvp was there? Oh yeah, just PvP realms. There wasn't honor until patch 1.4 (http://www.wowpedia.org/Patch_1.4.0) and battlegrounds (AV/WSG only) until patch 1.5 (http://www.wowpedia.org/Patch_1.5.0).<br />

i come to this site to see class changes and whatnot to find out how it will affect my class in pvp. its nice, FOR ONCE, to see a pvp video on the front page. <br />
<br />
<br />
im simply shocked at how much hate there is for this video being put up. he is incredibly skilled, and watching how he sets up his kills is awesome. its extremely obvious that all this hate is coming from people who are literally clueless as to what he is doing.<br />
<br />
if you didnt like it, move on, it simply wasnt for you. i dont watch any of the heroic kills, because i know its not for me. but i dont hate on it everytime i see them posted.</div></div><hr />

Reckful is atm. one of the best ( if not the best ) rogue in the world. If you even watched a whole movie, you'll see that he's doing like few things in a short time, so it really takes a bit skill to play like him. He even explained what he's doing ( yup, small white letters in some parts of movie ). So Reckful was actually amazing.<br />

Very good video, only part of this new post I bothered to watch/read frankly.<br />
Reckful has earned every single gladiator title from season 3 on. He is the only player to do a similar feat...sure multiple season glads aren't entirely uncommon, but very few of them have been rated #1 in their battlegroup (and reckful plays on one of the most competitive battlegroups out there) consistently for 7 seasons in a row now. Vengeful/Brutal/Deadly/Furious/Relentless/Wrathful (and soon to be Vicious) Gladiator Reckful is indeed a big deal. Pretty much hands down the best rogue in the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theendgamelv3</div><div class="date">2011-03-09, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a boring video. 2 people who like PVP vids and know who Reckful is found it boring and one of those guys suggested other videos of his. I watched the video for 3-4 mins and there wasn't anything too exciting for me. As a video to learn or to analyze, yea it might be a good video for that, but it isn't that enjoyable to watch. With that said, PVE videos are JUST AS BORING. Seriously, watching WoW videos with gameplay in general are boring as hell. I watched some of Paragon's video of Sinestra not for entertainment, but to see a fight I may or may not never see and to see what they were doing. I was more interested when the hunter POV came up. <br />
<br />
To say PVP takes more skill than PVE isn't fact and will never be fact nor is PVE takes more skill than PVP. As someone said, apples to oranges. To say PVP takes more skill, do you honestly think that the top PVP players if they were in a guild together and did PVE content do better than Paragon? At the same time I don't think the guys at Paragon could out best the best pvp players in the world. PVP and PVE are 2 different beasts. The top guys who PVP like Reckful deserve alot of props, they are the best of the best just like Paragon and top guilds in the world for PVE.<br />

While Reckful is a great player, his video was fucking boring.<br />
<br />
I wish people would stop sucking up to him and taking the video for the video, instead of argumenting that the video is great because the player is great, which is a terrible logical fallacy.<br />
<br />
If you pick any 5 videos to watch from Glads at AJ right now, I can guarantee at least 4 of them will be better than this. I would know, I actually watch PvP videos. The only particularly enjoyable scene here was he controlling the Rogue with re-saps (even resapping while shadow dancing) while killing his teammate, everything else was duelist skill at best.</div></div><hr />

Boring for scrubs like you that don't understand what is going on, sure. It just looks like a bunch of random pvp to the uninitiated. You can see the skill of him and his teammates quite clearly on display, the way he shadowsteps to kick healers when their dps is close to dropping or even stays on them to allow the shadow priest and dots to finish him off, and the way his shadow priest utilizes leap of faith, and the druid uses nature's grasp when his shadowstep is on cooldown at the appropriate times.<br />
<br />
The rest of your post shows you to be an obvious troll so I'll just leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Fact is that most of the &quot;entertaining&quot; pvp videos out there are full of scrubs and usually lots of gimmicks (SEE: MERCADER, a decent pvp rogue without even a duelist title backing him up, yet he gets praise from all the masses on boards like this due to his entertaining gimmicks), and this one is not. You can learn from watching this. And that makes it far more worth it to take a look.</div></div><hr />

His video is boring (even if you know what's going on most of the time), with the included horrible music, is terrible. If you're going to make a video &quot;for people&quot;, which you are if you're posting this stuff up on YT, please stop putting music &quot;you think is great&quot; in there because many won't like it. Then again, I think PVE-kill vids are boring too, dealing with scripted fights with mechanics that sometimes RNG for you or against you. WoW isn't a game to demonstrate superior player skills anyways, as it's very-very casual at it's core. PVE is &quot;who has the most time, the luckiest RNG, best latencies&quot;, while PVP has an added layer of &quot;human touch&quot; meaning it can't be scripted but usually people go for the same &quot;strat&quot; anyways based on comps. IMHO: player skill level demonstration: WoW PVE --&gt; WoW PVP -&gt; RTS --------&gt; Solo FPS --&gt; Team Based Objective FPS. There's really no disputing it neither in my mind, as I've tried numerous times already.<br />
<br />
Firelands raid looks more of the same'ol-same'ol. Maybe the final product will look 10x's better or at least look different, we'll see. I hope they don't plan on leaving in a raid with only 7-bosses for an entire tier as that'll get beat as fast as it's up, or after their stupid &quot;gating to artificially extend said content!&quot; is up. I was under the assumption from reading past articles prior to Cata we'd get TWO RAIDS per patch plus a bonus lottery boss. If we get 7+1, we're getting hosed.</div></div><hr />

We do not yet know all of the content coming out in patch 4.2. It is likely that there are other raids as well that we have not yet been told about. Firelands is a given, since we already know what's going on in Hyjal. There's probably more surprises in store for us, Blizzard did state that their raid model for Cataclysm would be to have several smaller raids for the first few tiers, and 7 bosses indeed is a small raid.</div></div><hr />

You can learn from watching this. And that makes it far more worth it to take a look.<br />
<br />
So, in your eyes, mixing Ad Hominem attacks with counter-arguments that are barely tangents to the main arguments while speaking eloquently disqualifies your post as a troll? Good one.<br />
<br />
Shadowstep kicking focus targets is a challenger skill at best.<br />
Smoke bombing a dps under 2-4k health and then letting him die to his partner dots isn't gladiator level either.<br />
Anyone who has been doing arena for Wrath know more than a handful of Death Grip tricks and using Life Grip in reverse isn't something that would take a brain surgeon level of intelligence to do. Chase Warlock down the dalaran arena because he's obviously going to teleport back up, Life Grip Rogue back upstairs, wow, that was so hard/unpredictable to pull off.<br />
<br />
I suggest you go &quot;initiate&quot; yourself into what high level PvP feels like, because one could not simply believe this video was one of the best high level matches that players have to offer unless he is a total scrub, or a sheep devoid of his/her own opinions that just regurgitates whatever nonsense his/her internet gods speak...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TurdChef</div><div class="date">2011-03-09, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's with this PVP video? I much prefer watching a mage pressing a one button macro for 2 minutes against a big boss model, and occasionally having to move out of a cyclone or chain lightening. Not forgetting the exciting part of the 5 minute encounter - bloodlust!!!<br />
<br />
That video does show the difference between PvP and PvE. <br />
<br />
They're completely different skill sets - <br />
<br />
PvP: Thinking what to do in the next 2 seconds, watching your health bar religiously<br />
PvE: Being organised as a team and also very patient.<br />
<br />
Sadly team-based PvP (battlegrounds) doesn't bridge the gap at all. Arena at the top ranks is very skillful but down at 1000-1500 sorry but it's just a gear, health point and class battle.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaril</div><div class="date">2011-03-09, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You obviosly lost the part where BLizzard were talking about the future in the last few mins...<br />
Yes, all companies talk about the future. <br />
<br />
You do know that after Warcraft 2 was released, they still had patches and support for warcraft 1 right?<br />
They still supported warcraft 2 after 3 was released.<br />
<br />
They STILL make patches and support both Warcraft 3 and diablo 2 (although its been a while). Blizzard doesn't want to lose any of their +12million players to any other game except for a blizzard game. They have a HUGE development staff dedicated to their new project. Warcraft has many years left in its life and no one at blizzard has ever said anything about it slowing down.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THey did not complete remodel anything... go read the inerviews that were taken with BLizzard devs in GDC 11. THey talked about doing 1/3 rd of the game in Cataclysm. And if you fly over places like felwood you will see how your &quot;total remodel&quot; is just bull. <br />
<br />
You have no idea what you're talking about. The entire world of azeroth outside of northrend was not modeled for flying like northrend is. There was invisible walls everywhere, invisible zone boundaries you couldn't cross, mountains with no textures on the other side. The Kalamidor and the eastern kingdoms had to be redrawn and remodeled completely. The simple fact that you can fly over felwood disproves your statement about not remodeling the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont find it staggering.. I find it very badly done and will not stand the test of time over the next 5-6 years. They needed to do alot more and do it alot better to actually make the game stick for the future. They didn't. Nothing staggering about that.<br />
<br />
I have absolutely 0 doubt that the next 2 expansions will continue to improve warcraft in ways that we cannot yet imagine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes they are ignoring WOW for the new games- their goal is to get subs from WOW to go into their new games. Go watch the last few mins again - somehow you seemed to have missed all of it. <br />
<br />
You seem to lack the basic understanding that a company can hire a new development staff to either continue work on existing projects or create new projects...<br />
<br />
but you may be right, 2 more expected expansions and dozens of patches adding dungeons, raids, quests and other content over the next 3-4 years is definitely ignoring the world of warcraft<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No they did not rebuilt the whole game - they did 1/3rd. They did not change the playstyle of most of the classes - they just created a way for them to balance it very easily. And I never said I didn't like the changes. I said they are doing a very poor job considering the support that the game is getting from the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Something tells you me you play a deathknight, the only class they didn't change the playstyle of because they had already created the new playstyle in WotLK.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes there is a MAJOR lack of creativity in the WOW development team atm. With a &quot;total&quot; rewamp of the old world (like you claim) they should have worked on the future systems that will become major part of every MMO - Heck that ALREADY has become a major part of every MMO. That would include more custimisation of character and look + armor. That would also involve adding more variety to mobs - improving the engine so that everything doesn't look exactly the same from lvl 1 to lvl 85. Thats something that BLizzard should have been working on IF they were REALLY doing a total rewamp of the old world. THey just didn't. They changed few maps. Rest is left but ugly like felwood.<br />
<br />
This makes absolutely no logical sense. It's kind of like you're drunk and rambling on about how the cap and trade bill is going to hurt our economic growth causing companies to go out of business because they can't afford to hire 2 new employees to monitor their carbon emissions because it would reduce their profit from $2b/year to $1,999,900,000/year.<br />
<br />
You can read the patch notes again if you want to.<br />
almost everything changed in wow.<br />
They have a 100% re-written game engine that warcraft uses. <br />
They have completely rebuilt 2 of the 4 landmasses in warcraft.<br />
They went through every [armor/weapon] item in warcraft and had to remodel it in some fashion.<br />
They changed how nearly every talent, skill and ability works.<br />
Nearly every character and monster WotLK and earlier has has new models. <br />
Every zone in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms has changed in some way, some zones had dramatic transformations , some had minor ones.<br />
<br />
These were in the expansion release notes and documented on this website.<br />
<br />
Blizzards next generation MMO engine is not going to be something that other mmo's can do (things like more character customizations, roffle), but is going to be something that once again is going to change the entire MMO gaming industry.<br />
<br />
They are still adding new raids, new content, new story lines, new zones, new world(s) to explore, new (and old) villians to defeat and new heroes for us to fight beside. We will have YEARS to go before we've been able to exhaust all of the probable stories of warcraft. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Im very dissapointed in the way BLizzard is now JUST thinking on how they can end WOW gracefully - instead of taking the game forward to move it from 12 mills to 20 mills. The potential is there IF they were intrested. THey are not. They are just going to spend their broadband capacity on another game - trying to get WOW players to play some other of their games. And no - thats not what WOW players should take lightly and quietly.<br />

Some of you guys are completely, totally brainwashed. Lot's of the other stuff you said is wacky, but this is over the top. Blizzard is lucky to have people like yourself because no matter what they do to you, you'll come crawling back to them making excuses for why you deserved to get backhanded. FACT is, this is NOT the blizzard of old. That blizzard died years ago, namely when they signed into contracts with Activision, becoming Actiblizzard. They answer to Bob Kotick now, and Kotick only knows one thing; &quot;ring the customer for every last bleeding cent&quot;. Ohhhh, hai sparkle pony, $25 plz. &quot;New this new that, but hey, we recycled Tier sets, again.

I'm not looking forward to an entire tier of FIRE (didn't they learn from ICC?),<br />
but with all of that crankiness aside...<br />
<br />
Yeah, i still want two raids to come out in 4.2.</div></div><hr />

That's fine. If didn't know that Fandral went nuts then you haven't really been paying attention anyways. Buh bye!<br />

The point of me even writing that there was to point out that there was some importance to that, not to make someone put spoiler tags on it.<br />
<br />
Ok I gotcha. I thought you were QQing about it. Every once in a while some idiot gets on here and totally freaks out about spoilers, which is really quite baffling.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as people not liking/caring about the pvp video, for me personally it wasn't because I don't pvp. I like pvp and I like watching pvp. It's because it was a shitty video. Wreckful is a badass, we get that you fanboys. The video was still bad. The music sucked, the quality was shit so you couldn't see what the hell was going on and there was no narration so you couldn't hear what was going on. It was just a big blob of pixels attacking other big blobs of pixels. If it was in high def with some narration that would be one thing, but it wasn't. It was a poorly made video.</div></div><hr />

Yeah he has skill and he is most likely super awesome. <br />
<br />
However it was way to fast edited and not nearly enough explanitory so for us who have never played high-ranked arena or a rogue was totally lost in the video, atleast i was. Please link some better PvP videos next time, like old Laintime vids :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruffertus</div><div class="date">2011-03-10, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reckful has earned every single gladiator title from season 3 on. He is the only player to do a similar feat...sure multiple season glads aren't entirely uncommon, but very few of them have been rated #1 in their battlegroup (and reckful plays on one of the most competitive battlegroups out there) consistently for 7 seasons in a row now. Vengeful/Brutal/Deadly/Furious/Relentless/Wrathful (and soon to be Vicious) Gladiator Reckful is indeed a big deal. Pretty much hands down the best rogue in the game.<br />
<br />
I don't see Dragonslayer on her titles, so let's stick to &quot;best PvP rogue&quot;, yeah?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freia</div><div class="date">2011-03-10, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to see him play an Enhance shaman, Feral Druid or Balance druid and do well, the matter of the fact is, rogues been strong on most seasons, i know since i have 1.<br />
<br />
He's skilled, there's no doubt about it, his video was meh, some good some bad, But he's priest partner really is insanely skilled, more so than the rogue, and why does so many mages use blink and iceblock on so so stupid times?, and they don't use pet frost nova, or anything, hunters that don't use Detterence/disengage, classes with disarm that does not use it, he does play a few good people, but loads of them just plainly sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems like Dispel has become the number 1 spell to use in PvP now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love seeing all the morons comment about Reckful's teammates being so much more skilled them him. Watch his video control. Rogues are about control not damage. They reason why his teammates can do what they do is because he is controlling the other team. And here is the thing Reckful has been good even in season where rogues were bad (last season for instance). And he has been sub even when sub was not the optimal spec.<br />
<br />
And mages do use their nova's here is the thing...they have no dispel protection! So getting a nova to stick is hard for teams with defensive dispels.</div></div><hr />

I will respect it tho, since I know I can't do what he/she is capable of doing since I don't have enough situational awareness or good enough reflexes to do what they do</div></div><hr />

but i bet Blizzard has something epic ready for this fight.<br />

other elementals in the game don't seem to have any problem moving around without legs though....</div></div><hr />

This guy has some personality!&quot; I actually took an interest and looked up his story, and I've loved him ever since. He's why I'll be reading the books. <br />
<br />
If we have to kill him, it's a crying shame. If the twilight caught him and manipulated him in his shattered state of mind, then we are total failures. If I have to kill him, with 24 of my buddies, then I wanna see his spirit reunited with his family.</div></div><hr />

I really wanted to see some good fights but it was just clips of a very geared rogue owning people with crappy gear. The only time I saw he fight someone decently geared it skipped over to another battle, without showing the outcome. <br />
<br />
With what I saw I can't tell if the player is good, or if he just has a few lucky streaks. He has to be good with that rating... the video just doesn't show it.</div></div><hr />
