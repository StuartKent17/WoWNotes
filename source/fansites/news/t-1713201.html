Patch 6.1 - Dungeon Quests<br />
But now, since I've out geared them...why should I bother returning? All that hard work put into dungeons by Blizzard and I only have enough incentive to run them for 1-2 weeks before never returning to them for the rest of the expansion.<br />
6.1 introduces new daily quests that set you on a number of different types of tasks. You're provided a random task type each day, and within that type a quest is chosen out of a bucket of possible quests. One of the task types is to complete a specific dungeon, and you'll receive a bag with gear up to (I believe) 655 ilvl. Say you get the dungeon daily, and so do I, we'll both have the same quest for that day to go (for example) go do Everbloom. Whereas our friends may get tasks of the other quest types (bounty kills, treasure hunts, raids, professions, etc). So you can visit each others Garrisons to pick up the quests you want to do that day. You can do all of them by coordinating who has what quest types available, or just do the one that's in your Garrison for that day. <br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Itemization and Stats<br />
Their original reason for removing Reforging was the fact that everyone was using it solely to maintain Hit and Expertise cap. with those two stats gone, I legitimately see no reason why Reforging cannot be brought back and used in the way it was originally designed for.<br />
<br />
That was one part, but the bigger part was that it doesn't actually improve the game experience. There are still soft caps for some stats, but ultimately Reforging just didn't provide any engaging gameplay to get an item and then reforge it to whatever your best stat is based on a sim or recommendation from a website. That's not creating engaging gameplay. If the desire for Reforging is based on &quot;I'd like to make my items better by picking the stats I want more.&quot; the simpler answer there, and the one that does create engaging gameplay and interaction with the game world and other players, is &quot;Get better items.&quot;<br />
<br />
my haste was still higher, and I was stuck with a crappy haste buff from food. I finally managed to fix that last week with a nice trinket drop that was loaded with mastery.<br />
<br />
The moral of my story is two-fold: a) the food buff system needs to be revisited, so that people don't have to remove gear to get the buff they want (or not get it even if they do, as the case may be); and b) reforging needs to make its return, so that people don't get sad when they get new gear.<br />
Why weren't you making/buying food with the specific buff you wanted? You don't have to eat feasts.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there have been other sources of items than purely through drops, and other gearing sources are probably what you would have wanted to look at. But that all coalesces a bit back towards focused boss drops with the release of Foundry, which has larger drop tables and thus more items with a wider variety of stat focuses. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/361722-raid-loot-itemization-why-is-it-wrong/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16285109103?page=10#198))<br />
<br />
<br />
Premade Groups<br />
That's not fair i figure cause i pay monthly like everyone else I should be entitled to get into open raids without being denied by some one who probably doesn't know the fights as well as I do anyhow.<br />
Well, to flip it around: &quot;It's not fair I'm forced to invite people to my group I don't want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone pays the same and plays the same game, and everyone is capable of doing the same activities. I wouldn't put too much brain power into trying to figure out why other people are the way they are (unless you're getting paid for it. ;D). Instead I would make your options work for you, like finding a guild that's running Normal on a flexible schedule you can attend regularly, creating a group with friends and building a group that way, or just starting your own Normal group through the Premade Groups finder and inviting the people you want to invite.<br />
<br />
That last one is kind of the kicker. If you were to run your own group, would you invite yourself? Why or why not? What could you do to make yourself more appealing as a player to yourself as a group leader? Maybe it's better gear, but maybe it's also including a note about your experience/skill. Or whispering the leader. Or maybe it's just finding a group that isn't full on DPS? And then, if you were to make your own group, if you were very open about inviting people regardless of class/spec/gear/skill/experience, and you repeatedly wiped on the run, how might that influence your future decisions? What if you only picked people with high ilvl and you succeeded, how might that impact your future decisions?

Speaking of the coin, can we coin the mount from Rukhmar?<br />
The mount from Rukhmar cannot be obtained through a bonus roll, only through a direct loot of the corpse. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562720166157762561))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
For the New Garrison Visitors in 6.1, do they only spawn in Level 3 Town Halls? Currently it seems that way on PTR @WarcraftDevs<br />
Correct, new visitors will only show up in Garrisons that have been upgraded to level 3. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562742690283270144))<br />
<br />
.Any chance we will soon be able to use our cooking skill with the fires places in the Garrison Inns? Seems odd that we can't.<br />
Yes, this is fixed In 6.1; you'll be able to use them for cooking in the T2 &amp; T3 Horde/Alliance Inns, and Alliance Town Hall. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562750435795435521))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably to offset the Treasure Hunter trait, but yeah. I was expecting them to lower the effectiveness of the trait, not increase the 'need' for it by reducing the base gold you can get.<br />
<br />
It's the exact opposite of what they did with Scavengers; too many people were going solely for Scavengers, so they reduced the trait's effectiveness and increase the Resource yield from missions, so people didn't feel as obligated to get Scavenger followers.<br />
<br />
Now Gold missions are less lucrative and the trait is still, over all, a bonus, just not as much as a bonus as it would have been. Seems to me leaving the missions as they were and reducing Treasure Hunter to, say, a 40% or 50% boost to Gold reward would have been better.</div></div><hr />

Same boat.<br />
<br />
I have a toon with two gather proffs (when I first rolled her, it was on a brand new server, and had no access to gold), but the gathering exp plus the sales I made from two gathers more than outweighed not having a top end profession. My profession was resource selling. heh<br />
<br />
With the changes to resources in WoD, my gold making ability got clipped almost by like, 75%. <br />
<br />
These quests for my followers were a great way to subsidize my gold income. But now that I've started raiding, it feels like all I do is break about even now. <br />
<br />
....these nerfs to the gold are gonna be brutal. I guess they are doing them because of the new followers that net you more gold. But still, blah.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me like they are trying out with how little effort and money spend they can get by without losing to much subscribers, i wonder how this will work out.....<br />
for a multi billion dollar corporation this just is pathetic,Blizzard was such a great and unique gaming company before the Devil eh i mean Activision bought them out (c'mon Kotick is even a Ginger everyone knows they have no Soul^^) Activision and EA are the cancer of the gaming industry<br />
buy everything remotely unique and turn it to shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? No! How could you say such a thing! Blizzard was gracious enough to even provide us filthy peasants with free additional content! They're a business, it's their job to make money and even having content patches at all just shows how much they care about us! Personally I wish Blizzard would stop adding content into the game post expansion release. Why should they slave over code, working grueling hours for pennies just to provide us greedy consumers with 'things to do'! <br />

You'll fucking love Twitter and selfies or you can quit you hater! <br />

You can do all of them by coordinating who has what quest types available, or just do the one that's in your Garrison for that day.<br />
<br />
Fuck that, really.<br />
<br />
I presume you can't just share the quests, from the way it's worded. It's the whole faff of the &quot;let's visit thingy's garrison!&quot; Just makes picking things up more tedious.<br />
<br />
If they can be shared, it's less annoying. Though I'd still rather just be able to pick them up by myself.</div></div><hr />

I never hibernated that early in an add on. The garrison is not that time sink they hoped-for, the dungeons getting old fast, the raids also (the bosses are too easy - never got with pug groups that far in a raid tier) - alts are also geared fast. One can reach the state of boredom very fast with this add on. I like WoW that's why I’m playing it since beta - I hope it will reach the state of entertaining me and not boring me.</div></div><hr />

That's not fair i figure cause i pay monthly like everyone else I should be entitled to get into open raids without being denied by some one who probably doesn't know the fights as well as I do anyhow.&quot;<br />

had to be posted by some kid someday, i mean seriously, if it's not fair then start your own fricking raid or start a guild and raid with the guild!<br />

<br />
I raid once a week and are progressing slowly through the raids. I have no problem with the raid content at all, but there's nothing compelling for me to do on a day to day basis, might log on for 20 minutes a day, if that.<br />
<br />
This situation isn't new, but I was hoping I wouldn't feel this bored after just three months (well, less than that, I've felt like this for a while). Previous expansions kept me engaged longer before the ennui set in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW is a carrot-on-a-stick game and NOT a sandbox experience. As such, there's usually a purpose to all that you do, quite often driven by some rewards.<br />
<br />
I have been playing the game since open beta some 10 years ago, with the occasional breaks. I am currently very casual. Have started playing the expansion 4-5 weeks later and very often majority of my week would go like this - log in the evening, send followers on missions, go to bed. By the time I had my first level 100 follower, people have been getting Mythic Caches from missions with 100% success and 645-decked army. I don't play a lot, I don't even have time to raid outside of pugs. Yet, with all that said, I have managed to get a full kit of 25 followers x 645 ilvl, to clear Highmaul HC and to get 660 ilvl worth of gear. <br />
<br />
Now, if I put the non-content features aside (Twitter, GFX effects, etc) and focus on the closest thing to &quot;content&quot; that they are adding - new Garrison missions and daily quests for outdoor bosses. Can anyone explain to me why the hell all these things provide 630-645-655 rewards when this benefits nobody but alts and people who play once per month....? Seriously, I have to re-run an already existing dungeon that is obsolete, just to get some reward that is 5-30 ilvls lower than the gear of a CASUALLY playing dude. <br />
<br />
Where's the incentive to run all of this, honestly? And like other people said - for those who raid in guilds, the average guild raids 2/3 days per week. What's in store for those guilds to do in the other 4/5 days that this MAJOR (it's labeled 6.x, not 6.0.x) patch brings?<br />
<br />
And that &quot;if you don't like it, don't play it&quot; argument is the most bullsh*t thing I have ever heard in my life. How about instead of abandoning a product at first sight, we express our opinion and try to influence its development? It's friggin' logical, you know? If I have voted for a party that forms the government and the government does sh*t, I will go out on the streets and try to change something, not take the flight and move to another country... (&quot;if you don't like it, play another game, yo!&quot;). If I am PAYING for something, I do have the right to express my opinion for the quality of the service/product I am getting and to have that direct feedback go directly to the provider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, &quot;get better items, &quot; I'm trying blizzard, but given that im still using a 645 dasher and pooling coins for dagger rolls (that yield nothing) your commentary is largely stupid. <br />
<br />
Some of the itemization is just horrendous. The challenge for dual-weilders to port out competetive dps needing x2 weapons comes to mind. It's true that trinkets aren't nearly add important as they once were, but for melee, weapons are still king (and for autoattack rogues, morseso than ever) so reforging actually have me some comfort and control in your rng-fest</div></div><hr />

It's just that all the content of 5.3 was concentrated into one thing that Blizzard could slap a label on, and 6.1's content is all over the place and thus harder to quantify. I'm more excited for 6.1's content than I was for 5.3's, for sure, although I do wish we had gotten the Iron Docks stuff and made this patch more like 5.1.<br />

I personally don't care. 4.2 will be around soon enough with more content.<br />

Not to nitpick your post, but the x.x.x version system is major.minor.revision, so 6.1 is not a major patch.<br />
<br />
I agree with you on most of your other points though, I play a lot and I'm pretty much at the point where outside of raids and rated pvp, all I can do is repeat the same stuff on alts. This is not really new, but it definitely got to that point a lot faster lol.</div></div><hr />

BRF should of just been released at launch - it is the same raid tier. Highmaul was a teaser raid to keep people strung along with &quot;content&quot; for a bit until the real raid was released. So, no. Who cares about the raid, casual everyday content is non-existent or sucks - horribly. When I can say that Cataclysm was more entertaining at this point in the expansion, something is seriously wrong.</div></div><hr />

Define &quot;held off&quot;.<br />
<br />
Do you mean that the raid wouldn't have been announced until 6.1 hit the PTR? Because that would be a little better, albeit the problem with 6.0 being a barren wasteland would be even worse.<br />
<br />
Or do you mean that the content that was tested and announced for 6.0 would be blatantly delayed to artificially inflate the amount of content that 6.1 could claim to have? Because I can't imagine anyone being even remotely okay with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, let's have raiders have to go to both BRF and Highmaul right at the start. I wonder why you're not a Blizzard Dev when you have such brilliant ideas. Let's not even mention your sharp eyes on noticing the npcs talking about needing to kill the Iron Horde's allies before being able to attack one of their strongholds. Let's not even mention anything about the legendary questline, which required both raids to be done for their respective quests.<br />
<br />
It seems like you're not actually raiding if you honestly thought Highmaul was a &quot;teaser raid&quot;. Have you even attempted anything past Mythic Kargath, let alone Mythic Twins?<br />
<br />
Inb4 &quot;I have a life outside of wow, noob&quot; , &quot;You dont need to do mythic to complete the game&quot; or other bs rebuttals.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I for one welcome our versatility-filled overlords. I'd be less upset about the lack of reforging if it weren't for the fact that we didn't have to deal with the cognitive dissonance that is Blizzard wanting engaging gameplay and throwing versatility on gear.</div></div><hr />

There isnt one, this is all waste of time content, I dont even consider it content. Making up a quest to go kill a guy with no lore or reasoning behind it is as lazy as it gets. NO lore reasons to do it, no player power reason to do it. IE no reason to do it.<br />

No because lack of raid content is not the issue. Not having anything to do outside of raid time is the issue. They could put in 100 bosses they could be the best bosses ever, I still only raid 3 nights a week. Those other 4 nights are the ones that I have nothing to do.</div></div><hr />

Past expansions, patches either had enormous gaps in between patches, or they were released more frequently with less content. Yeah, it would be great if Blizzard could give us a new raid in 6.1, yeah I would love it if they added a lot of different things to make the game more enjoyable. But I don't think that's going to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If you aren't 100% satisfied with the game, you should quit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vote with your wallet. One of the few ways they will know if they do something that's regarded as widely unpopular is if subs start to drop. I want you to post what you don't like about the game on here obviously, you have every right to and it enables discussion which is a good thing imo. But if you really want to show Blizzard you don't like what they're doing, unsubbing is a damn good way to show that to them.<br />
<br />
On a different note, I'm not a fan of their reasoning behind taking away reforging. As a fury warrior, I was bummed when I got a mythic cache that had Ko'ragh's necklace in there. I need crit, and the damn thing had no crit, but I wasn't about to give up the huge strength increase, and I could enchant it. I still ended up with less crit than I had before, so it would have been really nice to trade some of that versatility, which is garbage for fury, for some crit. Also rerolling on bosses and getting a plate item that doesn't have crit is the saddest thing ever :(</div></div><hr />
