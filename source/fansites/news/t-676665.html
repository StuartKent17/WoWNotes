The Day of the Dead is a new mini world event added to the game with Wrath of the Lich King. Let's just say it's the Pirate's Day with a few more things, including a temporary companion pet : Macabre Marionette (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46831/macabre-marionette/). <br />
<br />
But first, you will most likely want to complete Dead Man's Party (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3456/dead-mans-party/).<br />
<br />
Go to any graveyard, preferably the one of your faction's capital city. (We'll get to that later)<br />
Dance with Catrina here. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/dayofthedead_1.jpg))<br />
That's it!<br />
<br />
Now let's get you a Macabre Marionette (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46831/macabre-marionette/). <br />
<br />
Buy the Recipe: Bread of the Dead (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46710/recipe-bread-of-the-dead/) from Chapman next to Catrina and learn it.<br />
Buy the Simple Flour (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/30817/simple-flour/) from any cooking supplies NPC (just take the one next to the trainer if you don't know where they are) and Ice Cold Milk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/1179/ice-cold-milk/) from most Innkeeper and Food/Drink vendors. <br />
Go to the graveyard of your faction's capital city and go to the Ghostly Cooking Fire (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/dayofthedead_7.jpg) next to Catrina.<br />
Create a Bread of the Dead (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46691/bread-of-the-dead/). <br />
Buy an Orange Marigold (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46718/orange-marigold/) or a Bouquet of Orange Marigolds (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46861/bouquet-of-orange-marigolds/) from Chapman (the NPC who sells the recipe) and use it. Ghosts will appear in the graveyard.<br />
One of the ghosts will offer the following quest : The Grateful Dead (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14166/the-grateful-dead/).<br />
Give the bread to the ghost to receive your Macabre Marionette (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46831/macabre-marionette/)!<br />

<br />
And you're done with the Day of the Dead. Below is the description from the official page (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/events/dayofthedead/index.html).<br />
During the Day of the Dead, the people of Azeroth gather in graveyards to celebrate and cherish the spirits of those they have lost. One can find the festivities in the cemeteries of any major city where celebrants cook, drink, don costumes and more.<br />
<br />
Can you feel it? The spirit world draws close during the Day of the Dead. This is why we decorate the graves of our dearly departed with flowers and candles and offerings: to welcome them back, even if only for a time. <br />
<br />
Features<br />
Type: Memorial Holiday<br />
Date: November 1-2<br />
Locations: Graveyards of all Major Cities: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar, Orgrimmar, Undercity, Silvermoon City, Thunderbluff, Shattrath City, and Dalaran City<br />
<br />
Dance with Catrina<br />
Come dance with her. Let us cherish and honor those we have lost in their ghostly presence, so that they might eat and drink and smile and know that they are loved. Walk up to Catrina, select her, and type /dance. You will receive an achievement and a 12 hour buff: Honor the Dead, which will change your appearance to that of Catrina or Chapman. <br />
<br />
The Grateful Dead<br />
Purchase some Orange Marigold or Bouquet of Orange Marigolds from Chapman and use them to see the otherwise invisible spirit in the graveyard.<br />
<br />
It's good to visit with friends and family again, though I may have overdone it... I've already eaten everything they made for me, says the Cheerful Human Spirit. Might I trouble you for some of that delicious Bread of the Dead? I'd be most grateful. Chapman there sells the recipe, I think.<br />
<br />
Acquire some Bread of the Dead and give it to the Cheerful Spirit.<br />
<br />
Your reward is a Macabre Marionette, a small pet that looks like a skeleton wearing a sombrero and holding a pair of maracas. This pet can only be used during the Day of the Dead event - it cannot be learned and kept like other small pets.</div></div><hr />

I thrilled at infecting all of the battlemasters and listening to the QQ in trade. A friend and I managed to get the Hall of Legends locked down for even more frustration. Unfortunately, the carnage wasn't well received by most players and I believe I even read a posting somewhere that indicated the event was shortened precisely because of the backlash it generated. I'd still love to see it happen once a year for fun, but I think we can assume that it will never happen again.<br />
<br />
As for this particular event upcoming ... it's a little underwhelming for most of us. I suppose the RPers in the community could have great fun with this event. I'll be getting the marionette as soon as possible and taking some screenshots for my collection to remember him by until next year. <br />
<br />
I'm a little holiday'd out anyhow with all the grinding it took for my Death Knight to get the Sinister achievement from this year's Hallow's End.</div></div><hr />

Just like they can't have undead with bones showing, they can't have this pet. <br />

EU ppl complain when the US gets something that they don't, we complain when we don't get something they do too<br />
<br />
Well China is the same... Blizz aren't making it temporary in response to anything. It's merely a logical preemptive step. If this pet were not temporary, then we would be able to keep a pet that they 'unfairly' can't get. This would also count towards that pointless number of pets achievement and make more qqers. <br />

and of course some ppl will say this has nothing to do with why the pet is temp -_-. to them i /suggest to check out why blizz said panderan won't be added to wow.</div></div><hr />

It can't be a problem with China not having the pet. Korea and China have both had promotions that gave pets to people playing ONLY on those location's servers. If anything, EU/US players should be complaining.</div></div><hr />

I collect minipets in-game, and it does piss me off a little that this guy is only a temp. It's a marionette, why should that be temporary? It could be argued that my Dragon Kite is more delicate that some marionette, but the kite is permanent. Go figure.<br />

I really don't think the designers understand &quot;fun&quot; outside of raiding and arenas (until their community yells loud enough about BGs). I know a lot of the top designers worked on EQ1 for years. You'd think because of that they'd have a clue that customers would want and enjoy &quot;fluff&quot; items that have decent durations and short cooldowns. Sadly, they have demonstrated a lack of that wisdom.<br />
<br />
Add this pet to yet another lame &quot;fluff&quot; item in World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

China got a pet for the olympics the other year that was not available to anyone else. You also have collector's edition pets, pets from Blizz-Con and pets from the card game. These are not available to everyone and yet they are in game. Why not make this pet permanent? Seems like a lot wasted time to create an event and only get a pet for a day, day and half.<br />

Ok for everyone that thinks that the Mexicans came up with &quot;Dia de Los Muertos&quot; are wrong. Day of the Dead was a Roman holiday back around when Christ was alive and then was adopted by the Roman Cathlic Church and then made it over here to Mexico.

Go to the graveyard of your faction's capital city and go to the Ghostly Cooking Fire (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/dayofthedead_7.jpg) next to Catrina.When you write &quot;faction,&quot; it should be &quot;race.&quot; I went on my draenei shaman to the Stormwind graveyard (part of my Alliance faction) and the quest wasn't available to me.<br />

Both Roman and Jewish (non-Christian) records from the time, as well as writings from contemporary secular Roman and Jewish historians and authorities demonstrate that Jesus was a real person.

So I guess when you're dead we can deny your existence through time, seeing that even though you have a birth certificate etc and can make lame anti-christian sentiment posts. I doubt the history books will acknowledge you. Keep the topic about the game or shut up.<br />

<br />
Yo buddy, take a look at this funny stuff i've found about your Roman holiday:<br />
<br />
The Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico can be traced back to the indigenous Olmec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Mexican or Aztec, Maya, P'urhépecha, and Totonac. Rituals celebrating the deaths of ancestors have been observed by these civilizations perhaps for as long as 2500–3000 years.[1] In the pre-Hispanic era, it was common to keep skulls as trophies and display them during the rituals to symbolize death and rebirth.<br />
<br />
Just enjoy the game dude... and eat some &quot;Pan de muerto&quot;, it's delicious ;)<br />

It's like saying &quot;even the Bible acknowledges the existance of Moses.&quot; The Qu'ran speaks very highly of Jesus and his teachings, but just as Christians consider the teachings of Moses to be incomplete, so to does Islam consider the teachings of Christ to be incomplete. <br />
<br />
I think that most historians will agree that Jesus the man existed, in one form or another. That a man was born, taught in Israel and was eventually killed by the Romans and/or Jews for his teachings, I doubt you'll find a great deal of disagreement. Any question of the divinity of Christ is another matter entirely, as are questions about whether everything in the Gospels attributed to Christ actually was done by Christ, or whether the stories were... embellished. <br />
<br />
The wiki articles on Christ and his history aren't exactly ideal sources (it's wikipedia, after all), but http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus is as good a place as any to start if you've never looked for modern viewpoints on a historical Jesus. Viewpoints range from that the Bible is word-for-word correct to that there was no such person, he was made up to inspire the Jewish people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant a few things.<br />
<br />
a) Christians and Jews do have different religious outlooks. That the Bible includes the Torah does not indicate that Christians look at the Torah in the same ways that Jews interpret the Torah and the actors therein. By the same token, the Islamic view of Jesus differs from the Christian view of Jesus in several important respects.<br />
b) That a later book has an actor from a previous book does not serve to validate that the earlier book is itself fact. That the Baha'i faith agrees that the Moses, Jesus and Mohammed all existed more or less as they appear in their respective holy books does not serve in of itself as a validation that the Qu'ran is correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Source? To my knowledge the only records of a guy who could be Jesus (could because there was no reference to his name).. can not really be taken into account if you want to _prove_ his existence. I mean.. heck King Arthur, Achilles, Hercules or even gods have been documented in &quot;historical&quot; documents.. <br />
<br />
Sure it's well within possibilities that some or all of these really existed.. but to think this is a legit prove.. with all the nonsense they put into history books back then.. I mean even these days you can read shit after shit in historical documents... and it's an undeniable fact that back in the days they really liked to modify stuff so it sounds more interesting.. doesn't make it any more real than the story of Little Red Riding Hood (and I'm not saying I don't believe that the little girl with the hood existed)</div></div><hr />

The holiday in WoW makes reference to the Mexican holiday, not the romans, romans don't have marionettes, cempazuchitl flowers, etc.<br />
<br />
And the holiday in Mexico has it's backgrounds on the prehispanic civilizations, back in the day when Europe didn't know about America, spaniards just move the date to match the roman's day of all saints...<br />

Are there not enough OTHER topics you can bring religion into? Do you have to have an internets argument over Religion, the validity of jesus or god, or whatever stemming from what was meant to be a fun and cute holiday in World of Warcraft? <br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I'm sick of religion being brought into everything. Shove your religion, if I want to know more about something I'll go look it up. IMO a World of Warcraft forum is not the place. <br />
<br />
ps Xenryusho? You are a frickin tard. Read the last two sentences of the first paragraph of his post and his point is pretty clearly written. <br />
<br />
Also, as of server down today my marionette hadn't despawned. Anyone know if it was supposed to like the brooms did? <br />
