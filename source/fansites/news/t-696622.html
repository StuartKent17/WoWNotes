In the next minor content patch, we will be making some minor alterations to the way in which the internal balance system for Wintergrasp works in an attempt to better support realms with greater variations in the level of participation between the Alliance and Horde. Since we have never gone into much detail about how this hidden system currently works, we’d like to explain exactly how it will work in the next patch. Keep in mind that, although this information may feel very new to you, the actual changes being made in the patch to the current system are relatively minor.<br />
<br />
Here are the key systems in place behind the hidden Wintergrasp advantages and how they will function in the upcoming patch:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt; There is an internal tug-of-war scale not visible by players which will shift under specific conditions.&#13; The scale starts at 0 (neutral) and can move up to 700 points in either direction favoring the Alliance at one end, and Horde at the other.&#13; This scale is persistent and does not reset to 0 whenever control of Wintergrasp shifts.&#13; If an attacking force captures Wintergrasp Fortress while under the effects of any of the advantages listed below (400-700 points in their favor), the scale tips 100 points in favor of the opposing faction.&#13; If a defending force successfully defends Wintergrasp Fortress two battles in a row, the scale tips 100 points in favor of the opposing faction.&#13; Each consecutive successful defense after a faction’s first two consecutive defenses will further tip the scale 100 points in favor of the opposing faction.<br />
&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt; As a quick example, if the scale is at 0 and the Alliance capture Wintergrasp fortress while attacking, the scale will not move. If the Alliance defend Wintergrasp twice in a row after this, the scale will move 100 points in favor of the Horde. Each consecutive defense by the Alliance after this will move the scale 100 points further in favor of the Horde each time, bringing the Horde to 400 points in their favor after one unsuccessful defense and five unsuccessful attacks, a total of six Horde losses in a row.<br />
&#13;&#13; As another example, if the scale is at 400 in favor of the Horde and they capture Wintergrasp fortress while attacking, the scale will move 100 points in favor of the Alliance. If the Horde defend Wintergrasp twice in a row after this, the scale will move 100 points in favor of the Alliance. Each consecutive defense by the Horde after this will move the scale 100 points further in favor of the Alliance each time, bringing the Alliance to 100 points in their favor after one unsuccessful defense and five unsuccessful attacks, a total of six Alliance losses in a row.[/list]<br />
&#13;&#13; The following advantages are provided at the beginning of the battle for Wintergrasp whenever these corresponding ranges on the scale have been reached:<br />
&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt; 0-300: No advantages granted.&#13; 400: Faction starts with the Sunken Ring Factory under their control.&#13; 500: Faction starts with the Sunken Ring and Broken Temple Factories under their control.&#13; 600: Faction starts with the Sunken Ring and Broken Temple Factories under their control and gains access to Catapults after earning 1 kill in battle.&#13; 700: Faction starts with the Sunken Ring and Broken Temple Factories under their control and gains access to Catapults, Siege Engines, and Demolishers after earning 1 kill in battle.&#13;[/list][/list]</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem comes that if the Ally-Horde ratio is REALLY unbalanced, the system would still prove ineffective. That system is made just for that reason but yet, I don't think they could win even with the 700 point bonuses. The discrepancy would be too large and this system won't fix anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By that logic, DKs should know that frost presence almost doubles their threat and trying to tank in anything else is idiotic. LFD has proved this is not the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On certain servers, one faction completely dominates Wintergrasp (like mine, Horde on US-Arthas), and the other faction gets a very fraction of time in which to complete VoA in a given week.<br />
<br />
Horde has an iron fist on WG on my server. Alliance have tried some tricks to enable them to get siege tanks at the start of WG, and Horde still wins. I don't think this will change a whole lot in my case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it IS cheating to the players since this &quot;system&quot; has never been discussed<br />

honestly, i just think this &quot;system&quot; is what they're using to fix this all instead of saying &quot;it's buggy and we don't know how to fix it&quot;.<br />

after all the qq about this they'd have brought up this &quot;system&quot; before i'm sure IF it were something that had been implemented<br />

This is going to be difficult for you to comprehend, but when I zone into Wintergrasp on my Fruit Elf Druid and am promoted to First Lieutenant before I even pass the Sunken Ring Workshop on my ULTRA FAST ULTRA PURPLE ULTRA RAM mount, I am not &quot;cheating.&quot; Nor is any other Alliance on Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Or anybody else on servers where one faction tends to dominate the other.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a potential unbalance at 400 advantage. I think this gives the horde an advantage, since the horde will attack the broken temple right from the start, it allows them to more easily control both seige workshops until the alliance go down and take back sunken ring (which a few horde may be defending). Having sunken ring for the alliance at the start is pretty minor as with that being the first target it gets taken quickly.<br />
<br />
Also, this system fails to account for different participation levels at different times of day. On my server, the horde comes out much stronger after midnight, so this system pretty much gives the graveyard team an easy few victories, while really punishing them in the morning.<br />
<br />
I think the reason for this is that younger players are more likely to choose alliance, as they can better identify with them (since humans are alliance), and they are closer to being the good side. Hopefully this will calm down some with cata, when the humans are given more of a 'jerk' attitude.</div></div><hr />

From a development viewpoint it makes sense to use larger numbers. If you use large numbers, making changes in the future is easier. For example, if you want to make something add only half of the points, you could do that, change the amount of points to 50. If you want small events to have effect too and only add maybe 5 points and maybe want something to happen at 325 points - with the current system, you could do that. Othewise you'd have to rewrite all values, which takes additional development time. This technique is used in software development a lot, it's not only because they want to present big numbers - heck, if they wanted that, they could've taken something like 75000 (same as honor cap) and call it something like Honorous Hand to make it feel really epic.</div></div><hr />

Because there's probably other things that change the way the scale slides as well, or they can further fine tune it this way if it doesn't prove to be efficient enough to their desire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is common practice in programming .. you want to leave margin in between in case you'd want to add more levels in the future. If you'd use 0-7 as you suggested and you want to add 2 more levels which would basically be in between 2-3 and 5-6 (for example) you would have to shift all the values and it would be confusing to keep track of and possibly even break some of your code.</div></div><hr />

I'd imagine this already exists in the system.<br />

On our server as alliance we have 5-10 usually, and I went for almost 2 weeks without seeing wg belong to us. (granted I don't log on every 2.5 hours, but still)</div></div><hr />

On my server, horde generally gets instant rank, rushes the keep with max sieges then proceeds to have them all get blown to hell breaking into the inner courtyard, by which point we're so badly outnumbered that we can't get a push going from any side reliably.<br />
<br />
Make tenacity buff vehicle speed and damage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tenzing21</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is yet another awful epic fail by a dev team that is so out of step with the precepts of reality and basic math that I wonder on a daily basis how this game got of the ground.<br />
<br />
So, if the horde win one time and then the ally 7, the ally get closer to a boost? Are you fucking shitting me?!?!?! Why on Gods green earth would you ever believe that the one time horde won, was NOT due to the internal tug-of-war? Awful. If a side is x&gt;y down, then the imbalance causing objectives and kills-needed to become easier or auto-supplied, and the internal tug-of-war should NOT BUDGE AT ALL til the losers have won as many in a row as the winners in the previous winning spree. How can you NOT see this? <br />
<br />
Basic math for the win. <br />
<br />
I've done WG as horde and ally on two servers, and I can see the disparity caused by lack of basic appreciation for both common sence on the part of the would-be participant (13:23 [Immasmazu] guild says: &quot;Hey gais the dude is shremin wintersgrass is about to happen.&quot; 13:23 [Allyrnub] guild says: &quot;Yeah see, the thing is, no one in this guild nor this server cares, and that's coz we lose, on average 19 out of 20 WGs.&quot; 13:23[Capnonetime] guild says: &quot;Well the internal metrics show that Horde are just awful at knowing how to read MMO-champ and push buttons in a timely fashion, they use some hell-forsaken IP with latency in the low millions and they refuse to use addons or visit EJ forums. We deserve to lose and there's simply no way around it.&quot; 13:23 Meowndisjnt has kicked Capnonetime from the guild) and the inability of one side to overcome the randomness of the willingness to participate (due to either real or perceived imbalances and player apathy per pt. 1) coupled with yes, the sheer overwhelming numbers of active participants (also know as faction imbalances.) Any panacea needs to be adjusted on a realm by realm basis, and I'd say that WG should have a way to allow sheer participation and not *simply* wins/loses to be the determining factor in acquiring the WG blessing or any other in-game trophy or loot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nubs</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a similar problem, but people aren't talking about the real problem that these imbalances cause. On my server (US-Deathwing) Alliance gets siege vehicles in less than two minutes and owns WG in less than three minutes. Are there less Alliance than Horde? No, there's rarely tenacity on either side. So we have no tenacity and they completely steam roll WG. Then when we go to attack, neither side has tenacity and it takes us down to about the 5 minute (left) mark to capture WG.<br />
<br />
The system is obviously broken when the side that needs the help steam rolls the other faction during their offensive, yet can nearly hold off on defense every time the other faction is on the offensive.</div></div><hr />

this &quot;updated&quot; system wont fix a thing... it's in no way going to even come close to fixing the imbalance that is most pvp realms, and especially those that host some of the best pvp teams in the world... they need to limit the battles to a 1:1 ratio, rather than the fix number they have now (especially on BR, there's always horde waiting to go to WG after being kicked out from them being numbers capped, but there's never alliance waiting and there is always a heap of free spots)...</div></div><hr />

The dungeon deserter and dungeon finder debuffs are just the most awful things ever. Blizzard doesn't seem to realize that at level 80, a heroic usually only takes 15-20 minutes. So, if I get into a group as a tank and some idiot DPS pulls the first group because I have to drink up after buffing everyone, I can't kick that jerk because of the dungeon finder debuff. That means I have to deal with the idiot or leave myself. In which case, I'm going to be punished.<br />

<br />
So, if the horde win one time and then the ally 7, the ally get closer to a boost? Are you fucking shitting me?!?!?! Why on Gods green earth would you ever believe that the one time horde won, was NOT due to the internal tug-of-war? Awful. If a side is x&gt;y down, then the imbalance causing objectives and kills-needed to become easier or auto-supplied, and the internal tug-of-war should NOT BUDGE AT ALL til the losers have won as many in a row as the winners in the previous winning spree. How can you NOT see this? <br />
<br />
Basic math for the win. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the hell are you talking about? If the Horde wins once, and then the Alliance wins seven times, the HORDE get increasing bonuses, not the Alliance. The tug of war attempts to reach a balance point giving just enough for the battle to be decided closely. Your system where the winner's streak is copied has way too much lag time to adjust bonuses such that battles are closely decided.<br />
<br />
We should be glad you're not the devs. You've completely missed the point of the tug of war system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why not 0-7 and increase advantage by 1 point each double win/loose?<br />
<br />
<br />
One reason could be that with a few extra digits in there they have a lot more room to tweak the numbers later on. <br />
For example:<br />
&quot;Ok. This system didn't equalize things to a degree we are happy with. Let's say a winning streak under the influence of &quot;Ze Advantage&quot; only brings you 50 closer to neutral, and see how this works out...&quot; <br />
<br />
Two weeks later after ballance has shifted completely:<br />
&quot;Hmm... No - 50 is not enough. how about 75 - first bonus gone after two nods, and second bonus gone right after the third...&quot;<br />
<br />
You know... Tweaking.. Yes. It could be done with decimals, but it is a lot tidier to do without those when programming this sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

Now winning a defense is out of the question and we win half the attacks. Why? Bcuz we always have 2-3 tenacity, meaning we're out numbered. And tbh most ppl just gave up trying<br />
<br />
<br />
2-3 isn't that bad, on my realm, we're usually at 15 to 20, most the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are already on Live and have been for some time, and they dont help because hey! if you dont have a full team to fill up the siege engines you all can build... AND have enough people to defend them.... you're going to lose anyways. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, tenacity needs to effect siege vehicles more(speed, dmg, health)..... needs to reduce stun/silence duration. And needs to provide -dmg taken while you have the buff. (all in moderation and stacking)<br />
<br />
I mean, i can have this lovely tenacity buff that lets me rip people apart 1 on 1..... but when theres 4 people attacking me stunning and silencing me.... it doesn't equal out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, sorry forgot to phrase it as &quot;If the Horde wins once, and then the Alliance wins seven times, then the horde wins once, the ally get closer to a bonus.&quot; The point of my post was that if the horde are at 700 tug of war, then go and win, the ally actually get closer to a bonus. Which makes no sense. If the Horde need 700 bonus pts to win, maybe the whole damn system is flawed and the last thing we need is letting the historical WG hegemony get closer to retaining or re-acquiring the WG blessing. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abron</div><div class="date">2010-02-20, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a server where the faction transfer drastically altered the balance in PvP zones like WG this simply will not help.<br />
<br />
The problem is with tenacity and its lackluster to laughably ineffectual benefit.<br />
<br />
Whatever increase obtained due to any number of stacks of tenacity is blown away by the sheer overwhelming amount of crowd control the opposing faction can inflict and subsequently stun lock an opponent from 100-0%.<br />
<br />
Tenacity also does not transfer all its effects to vehicles (although it certainly feels like it doesn’t apply ANY transferable effects to vehicles at all). Neither does resilience, or ilvl. I’ve been in battles where my vehicle can be destroyed in a number of seconds by a single opponent and in many cases the enemy get out of their guns, along the keep and towers, to simply melee/range my vehicles to death.<br />
<br />
Also tenacity does not benefit a lesser number of players from capturing a shop from a larger number of opponents. So a group with tenacity cannot hold control of a shop even if they tear through an overwhelming number of opponents.<br />
<br />
The only solutions I can see are to:<br />
<br />
A) Limit the number of players to an equal amount on both sides, thereby eliminating the need for tenacity (and effectively turning the zone into a BG with a 2 hour queue).<br />
<br />
B) Buff tenacity in the following ways:<br />
<br />
1) Increase its effectiveness to 50-100% per stack including either increased diminishing returns or a resistance percentage to crowd control effects/abilities.<br />
<br />
2) Allow tenacity to transfer its full effects to vehicles, as well as the aforementioned resilience and ilvl stats.<br />
<br />
3) Allow tenacity to increase the speed at which a shop can be captured.</div></div><hr />

why not 0-7 and increase advantage by 1 point each double win/loose?<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably because it makes it trivial to add in additional conditions that change the scale by smaller increments.<br />
<br />
Like how most states number interstate exits by miles, and then by the alphabet (101a, 101b, etc.) if there are multiple exits within the same mile. Compare that to the New Jersey Turnpike, where they just numbered the exits 1-7 originally. Now they've added a dozen other exits between 1 and 7, and it's a complete nonsensical mess, because they had to keep exits 1-7 numbered the same to keep maps and directions accurate.<br />
<br />
*Oops, about twenty people responded before me. I still like my interstate analogy though so I'll leave it ;)</div></div><hr />

Either way, one faction is always going to have decent access to it and its rewards. <br />
The general consensus is that on a lot of imbalanced servers its horde that are dominating. I'm on Dreadmaul Oceanic and this week I have been on every day for several hours and have lost every single battle to the point where horde have even been ganking our GY- honestly i think i have seen one wall come down that's about it.<br />
Even in stronger times, Alliance never really defended it well. Sure there are a lot of factors like people not bothering etc etc but it seems like a hell of a lot more people are Horde in general and it is really ruining the experience of VOA.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabbaell</div><div class="date">2010-02-21, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd prefer to see them actually putting more effort into balancing servers in the first place so this kind of thing isn't needed. Seriously, why allow faction changes and new players on a faction that already massively outnumbers the other? Also, if they can do things like this for WG, why can't they come up with something for the unbalanced battlegroups that they've said they can't do anything to make more balanced. Having to pay for a server transfer if you don't want to keep losing over 80% of battlegrounds is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />
