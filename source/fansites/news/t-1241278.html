I think there's probably more, yet it seems the other classes that have been a bit too &quot;strong&quot; in PvP got hit with the nerfbat (e.g. warlocks) and warriors will just keep going at it.

Not sure what game you're playing, but as a Guardian druid, I'm often in the top five damage done for raids and first for 5-mans. Protection paladins are the ones with damage problems, 'though if the data mined information is any indication, Blizzard at least recognizes that.</div></div><hr />

Even if these were official patch notes from a PTR a week before it goes live, there is nothing really in there that is devastating to any class. Most of it appears to be shifting burst dps to sustained dps. Of course the people who cry about ´x´ being OP only read the buff to sustained dps and ignore the nerf.<br />
<br />
in any event, this is 2 months away from going live at least. Relax.. save the crying for your playing ability on live.</div></div><hr />

Lol blood fear is rubbish now. Only melee attacks. Lulz I'll take Howl of Terror instead me thinks.<br />
<br />
I will focus on PVE because that's what i play the most on my warlock. I've tried the 3 specs this tier, and eventually settled on Affliction for the majority of fights (then my raiding group came to a spot and i couldn't experience much more than lfr for a couple weeks now...) but from what i've gathered, the way warlocks were tuned now, allowed us to stay competitive against other nuking classes. Last expansion i was an avid raider on a group pushing heroic progression, and i was confortably on the top 3 dps all the time, since this tier i've felt the need to bring my A game to stay on par of other classes. Nerfing our &quot;big weapons&quot; will be an invite to opt for other classes other than warlocks.<br />
<br />
Regarding pvp, Chaos Bolt sure has a long casting time, but correctly using cds a warlock can get an interruptable CB, that hitting at the right time can make the difference between a live opponent or a dead one. Yet that still remains untouched...<br />

<br />
My Windwalker should be happy with most of this stuff. Turning Combo Breaker into a base ability and making our new Mastery increase the damage of our main brew is an interesting idea. I got rid of my mage, warrior, rogue, and druid since the amount of alts I owned was getting stupid. In the end, it's all numbers and doing slightly different things to create slightly different numbers is pretty boring.<br />
<br />
I'm liking the amount of bosses this tier and seeing Jin'rokh should be fun. Looking forward to seeing the rest. I'm sure people are going to be convinced that the sky is falling, but according to them, WoW has been dying horribly for the past eight years and I'm unsubscribing and Blizzard is gonna be sorry, etc.<br />

Except dinosaurs aren't really a thing of Azeroth's past. There are still plenty around and often in abundance in many zones. Or do people forget that raptors, one of Azeroth's more plentiful and widespread species of wildlife, are, in fact, dinosaurs?</div></div><hr />

Lol what ? 2 chi, 0s cooldown VS 0 chi, 30s cooldown. Isnt it obvious, the old one is WAY better ? Chi cost is irrelevant when the cooldown is so high anyway...<br />

If you put your mouse over it, it says 1.3<br />
<br />
WowHead datamined changes says:<br />

<br />
SO perhaps it's just a typo.<br />
<br />
--<br />
But the thing that I noticed first is this:<br />
Glyph of Inferno Blast : Your Inferno Blast spell spreads Pyroblast, Ignite, and Combustion to 1 additional target. <br />
That means you can't put Living Bomb in one target and spread to adds anymore now. <br />
But adds one target to the other dots, so it means 5 targets with Pyro/Ignite/Combustion...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are these the only notes? If that's it, then our hope of Warriors being anywhere near balanced for PvP is long gone, heh.<br />
<br />
Looks like they nerfed the healing from 3% to 2%(1.7% in PvP, as it's affected by the 30% healing nerf) plus the rage. They should have nerfed Def stance - that was the real problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
You had your 4 months on the top of the meters.<br />

lol! Yup, they did.<br />

Looks like Ret Elemental and Shadow will remain joke specs until more people start playing healers, although Ret paladins have had the mana-cost of judgement reduced!<br />

Elemental got nice buffs. Shadow got nothing(but they didn't need much, really) and Ret got a few tweaks.<br />

Lawl just lawl, check your facts go to worldoflogs.com and if you still think your right then yea replace the word &quot;warlock&quot; with &quot;firemage&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the subject of the warlock nerfs I agree blood fear needed a longer cd and needed to break on low damage, in addition I'd be alright with it being a much shorter duration too. However the change they have made to it basically means it's a talent that know one will take esspecially costing 20% hp what a joke.<br />
<br />
Here it is guys people have been qqing about our class since expansion launched some of it justified some of it jealousy cause of the new spell effects etc we got and they didn't (I'm looking at you mages!!!) but the bottum line is this warlock is the least played class next to maybe rogue. So when every other class crys for us to get nerfd it's a lot easier for blizz to keep the majority of people happy rather than the small percentage of people that play locks. It's always been this way hell they care so little about the people playing this class they didn't even bother to put the nerf to chaos bolt in the patch notes.</div></div><hr />

PvP: Cyclone still has 20yards range unlike min 30yards like every other class' CC<br />
PvE: Nature's Vigil nerf won't reduce too much our damage (a bit reduced because using jade serpent potion in conjuction with the talent will give a smaller boost)<br />
PvE: Nature's Vigil nerf is not justified and will reduce our capability to burst<br />
PvE: Soul of the Forest is far more interesting, but giving up Incarnation + nerfed Nature's Vigil will totally remove burst from a class that already lack an Execute phase dmg increment</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is it a special snowflake thing? It's just another level of content for the people who can get there,and besides,it's just one boss,we can still do 12</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure everyone who wants to see the last boss will get a chance to do so, whether it's this tier, next tier, or whenever.<br />
<br />
The special snowflake stuff is when people want to prevent other people from seeing content or gaining something based on their skill. We don't have any reason to believe that Blizzard will do that here.</div></div><hr />

So you are quiting WoW due to some preliminary changes to the class you play? New gaming generation at his best ... hard times to be a game developer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may want to check again by date. Fire Mages got a sizable nerf a few weeks back that made a great deal of them switch to Frost or Arcane.<br />
<br />
EDIT: After looking through there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to sort out anything by date, so that kind of defeats my &quot;advice.&quot; Ah well.</div></div><hr />

No,the special snowflakes would be those that believe they are entitled to have everything handed to them, simply because they pay the same money as everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bitterness aside, that's not the definition. It's called &quot;special snowflake&quot; because you want to be &quot;unique.&quot; Even if casuals demanded access to Heroic Elite items they'd still not be &quot;special snowflakes.&quot; They'd be &quot;xerox snowflakes.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
TA DA!<br />
<br />
Now you can re-buy ALLLLLL your heirlooms all over again! Yay!<br />
<br />
(On a serious note, I really hope there's a way to exchange or &quot;upgrade&quot; them for a fee, the way you trade gear + token for heroic versions)<br />
<br />
They look like exactly the same item with the exception of the new shields. Seems more like the one's you have will now just scale to 85...</div></div><hr />

Which sadly will just sit in my bank alt's bank because I have 11 of every class on my server, and there's no way to transfer heirlooms cross-server.<br />
<br />
Though I wonder how they'll be acquired. The first heirlooms were bought with what is now honor points and justice points back in wrath, then cata introduced buying them with gold (but gated with guild rep). Will these follow the wrath model, the cata model, or something else?<br />
<br />
Lots of new weapons, at any rate, looks like I should start gathering mats for heirloom enchants.</div></div><hr />

Yay i get god damn bells and candles on my helm and shoulders... seroiusly.... candles...<br />
Not to mention the nice large bell above my head on the helm. DING DING FRESH MEAT ON THE MENU BOYS. What a waste of time.<br />
The pvp set looks only slightly better but is just boring and lame. Oh minus the massive sun like thing on the pvp helm? WTF?<br />
A priest set hasnt looked good since the days of ICC and that was only okish.....<br />
<br />
Zero buffs to holy.... <br />
Next to no healing pvp things added.... <br />

dead class PVE disc and shadow are ok. PVP shadow is ok. Everything else.... worthless. thanks blizz</div></div><hr />

Well played Blizzard. Pretty sure most already know but the August Celestials are based off of <br />
the Universe of the Four Gods.<br />
<br />
Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent - Seiryuu of the East (blue dragon)<br />
Chi'ji, the Red Crane - Suzaku of the South (red phoenix/bird)<br />
Xu'en, the White Tiger - Byakko of the West (white tiger)<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, instead of having a black turtle, Genbu, we got a <br />
black bull, Nu'ziao. Wouldn't be surprised if in the fight with whatever<br />
that Genbu looking turtle Nu'ziao came and help and I wouldn't be <br />
surprised if that turtle use to be one of the August Celestials as well.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard changed most main hand weapons to one hand so that they can be equipped in either hand for transmog purposes.</div></div><hr />

Also nerf to grimoire of sacrifice? Destro locks are already far from topping dps charts in pve, this won't help at all.<br />
Curse of enfeeblement which was not very good is now crap (in the same way that curse of exhaustion was made irrelevant in cataclysm already, just when any melee seems able to jumps, teleport and whatnot. But then again affli pvp was destroyed in MoP).</div></div><hr />
