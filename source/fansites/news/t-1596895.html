<br />
How do you figure $40 for a pet?<br />
<br />
When for $40 you get:<br />
<br />
<br />
Virtual Access to Blizzcon and all the panels<br />
WoW Pet<br />
Hearthstone Card back<br />
SC 2 Portait and Decal<br />
D3 Transmogs<br />
Hereos of the Storm Mount &amp; Portrait<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you really meant to say for $40 you are only interested in the pet so it's not worth it then that would make sense, but your comment seems to insinuate that you only get the pet for $40.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO only one weapon für each class is a little bit weak. Why not using more generic weapontypes, so you can get for example that mace for a crusader, or a one handed weapon for your dual wield barbarian?</div></div><hr />

Well the post says 6 transmogs. It doesn't say exactly what types and what each one can be used on. All we know is what the image shows. The Weapon they show could work for 1H/2H weapons (interchanges weapon sizes and such), etc.</div></div><hr />

no... just no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hm, yeah you are right. I discovered this one here, showing all six:<br />
http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/15977182/<br />
<br />
It appears like we got several items from the Warlords:<br />
-Ner'zhul's staff<br />
-Kilrogg's mace<br />
-Blackhands hammer<br />
-Kargath's bladefist<br />
-Gul'dan's bock <br />
<br />
And a bow, not belonging to any of the warlords.<br />
<br />
It seems like some items are indeed class specific, while others are not.<br />
Book, Bow (Technically not, but de facto it is), and bladefists are class specific, the staff is not class specific... and the maces are questionable, though i highly doubt, that that Kilrogg thing is supposed to be a flail, so it will most likely be just a normal mace.</div></div><hr />

Going by the full preview image that shows all six, starting with the Barbarian and going clockwise:<br />
<br />
The Blackrock Destroyer: 2H Mighty Weapon<br />
Gul’dan’s Secret: Source<br />
Ner’zhul’s Staff of Shadowmoon: Staff<br />
Deadeye’s Mace: 1H Mace<br />
Fist Weapon of the Shattered Hand: Fist Weapon<br />
Bow of the Lost Warlord: Bow<br />

<br />
Yes, your account will be flagged. So when/if you buy Diablo 3 for PC/Mac, the items will be added to your transmog panel. At least that's how any type of bonuses linked to bnet accounts have worked in the past. So it would only be logical that it will work that way as well.</div></div><hr />

Yea, see I just looked at the initial image on MMO-Champ lol. Either way as you said it's subject to change and who knows if people complain about certain items not being moggable from Virtual Ticket they may either add more or add more sources to each type. Who knows.</div></div><hr />

Ahh wicked! Thanks man, ya just sold me :) Couldn't justify buying the ticket for just Gromloc and A card back :P But to wield Blackhands hammer? AYE! AYYYE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was once a Blizzcon Polar Bear Mount. You'd think coming up to the 10 year anniversary of WoW and release of WoD they would try to add hype via a unique mount and pet (Grommloc is terrible, no two ways about it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you might have nailed it. Murkalot was pretty awesome, Grommloc is a disappointing followup. The Heroes of the Storm mount looks cool, but I don't know if I'm going to even play that. Diablo t-mogs are meh... I don't seem to use that feature much. I dunno, just not all that excited about it this year.</div></div><hr />

I don't find the Grommloc all that aesthetically pleasing. I love my Murkalot even if he's from a silly place. <br />
<br />
A mount would've been nice for a change, but what do you expect from actiblizz? Players gets strung along, given just enough to keep them interested. It's minimal effort, high profit strategy. I don't blame the people who feel gypped by this.</div></div><hr />

How is it that the murloc joke thing still entertains people to this day? Is WoW really that devoid of other races? Is making something like Mini Tyrael really that hard?</div></div><hr />

No and I don't expect that, but a blizzcon mount would've been cool for a change. They could have sold VIP tickets that included a mount fo $20 or $30 more? Maybe that would include interviews or behind the scenes who knows. Ideas man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because you don't play Heroes of the Storm... YET. It's quite good, and since getting into alpha 4 months ago I've basically played nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Hours? I'd say minutes! Yeah, the goodies this year seem kinda lame ...maybe the Nexus mount for HOTS but God knows if i'll be able to play that one and the murloc is another painful reminder of an orc themed expansion.</div></div><hr />
