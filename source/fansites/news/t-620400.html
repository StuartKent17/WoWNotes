Used the good old corpse explosion in org AH. One paladin tried to cleanse it off himself at least 5 times (the one's i noticed) without any success, and the debuff was on a 5min timer now, while others still had 10mins and got cleansed off on the first try.<br />

Edit: anyone could refresh my memory if the guards we're lvl60 regardless on their lvl while non-zombified. A lvl75 guard turned into a lvl70 zombie.<br />

Well as a zombie you can interact with them and put on them someone's head :o<br />

i bumped my hit to 200+ and its much easier to cleanse the debuff(usually get it within 1~3hit)<br />

Chamber of Secrets<br />
The Argent Dawn Emissary wants you to search the chamber of Tenris Mirkblood within the Servant's Quarters of Karazhan.<br />

Excellent, an experienced adventurer. Precisely what we need.<br />

Went exploring as a Zombie and ended up walking through Terrorweb Tunnel, that connects EPL and WPL. At certain spots on the floor, your entire screen gets a strange animation. The red on the edge of your screen narrows into tunnel vison, and two things (they look somewhat like hands) come together in the center. It seemed to be triggered only by movement and location (not mobs, and standing still gets nothing). No other effect that I noticed. This was on the Runetotem server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason why you can interact with such things is simple.<br />
The sourge was an own faction since the very early beginning of WoW besides the horde, the alliance, the goblin factions and gnome factions, troll faction and what we all know.<br />
<br />
So, why can you interact with this stuff?<br />
<br />
The only reason is, that the &quot;scourge faction&quot; isn't bugless yet.<br />
Just think as a game designer:<br />
You put mobs in the game, give them the faction &quot;scourge&quot;. Okay, sounds logic,<br />
if you're alliance or horde or goblin or stuff you can actually kill it.<br />
Thats what it supposed to do. Just get killed.<br />
<br />
The other things like the spike with the head on it near thrall (I think it's this head<br />
which you can turn in, some orc from BWL drop it) was supposed to be used<br />
by the alliance and by the horde, since they didn't know that they will inplement<br />
the ability to be friendly to the scourge (or in other words: to join the scourge), so<br />
these objects ingame are &quot;unscripted&quot; if you interact with them as a member of the scourge.<br />
<br />
Might be turn out fun, let's see what kind of bugs / exploits pop up next :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing if there were a zombie boss that dropped free epix it would have been &quot;good&quot; for something right?<br />
Why not enjoy the fact that there's actually something new and dynamic to the game at least for the following days. The whole game is messed up anyway with the expansion aproaching and the new talents/achievements so why not just kick back with a few friends, turn into a zombie pack and have some fun for a change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the same Putress responsible for discovering the cure for the recent Scourge plague outbreak. <br />

Looks like pretty soon nobody will be able to cure it. And we finally get some history behind Putress.</div></div><hr />
