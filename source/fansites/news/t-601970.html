<br />
The first plan was to lower it to one month in the US and in Europe, but we decided to go for three months instead. The change of mind came between the US and European posts being made, hence why the one month cool-down was posted (and active for a short time) in the US, but not in Europe. <br />

AFK Debuff in Alterac Valley<br />
Hortus made a very small post about the report of AFK players in Alterac Valley. He didn't give an exact value but it seems that the amount of reports required to put a debuff on a player will be low.<br />
It does not require 30 people to trigger the AFK buff... I don't know where people are getting this idea.<br />

<br />
Reminder if you don't know yet what's the debuff<br />
We are adding a feature with patch 2.2.0 that gives players the ability to report afkers in the battlegrounds. Once they have enough reports on them they will get a debuff that will count down 30 seconds. They will need to engage in combat during that time or they will get another debuff that will prevent them from gaining any further honor. Once they engage in combat, the debuff is removed immediately.<br />
<br />
There is debate on both sides of the coin as to whether this will be the solution to AFKers, but we wanted to give a way for players to take some action against people camping in Battlegrounds that had some impact. <br />

<br />
<br />
As the guild master of one of those 'big guild', I'm going to step in here and ask what on earth you're talking about? Daggerspine, as far as I'm aware, didn't get a direct server transfer at any point, it simply suffered from the same problem that my current realm (Kazzak) is suffering from... that being a large number of high end raiding guilds. (As an example, we’re looking to start work on Illidan this week and we’re ranked 5th or 6th on the server, so the quality is pretty high). This large number of top guilds attracts people from other servers, looking to join one, who then mill around in IF, moaning that the big guilds are all nubs and elitist. <br />
<br />
Daggerspine wasn’t split in two – the top guilds simply chose to move to a new realm when one was offered to try and avoid this problem that had been plaguing us since around the start of Naxx. Unfortunately its followed us to Kazzak, and now Blizzard have taken measures to avoid it reaching the same crisis point it did on Dspine. I, and my guild, applaud them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The poster of the thread the EU-CM replied to referred to a post by Drysc from 2006 when they changed it from 6 months to 1 month, and then changed their mind shortly after that and made it 3 months. He must've not noticed or known, heh. There were no recent rumors I have heard about nor was anything changed, it's been 3 months for quite a while now.</div></div><hr />
