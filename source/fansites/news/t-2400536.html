I feel the same. But if we ever do get a Warcraft IV, I imagined he would be an adult and likely an important character so it would be nice to see a little bit of him now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or is it to simply show Magni having to choose between the two?<br />

Reason is that by contemplating his failures as a father to Moira, he's not gonna &quot;give up or make it worse&quot; with Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

Since he got a male heir, his grandson, he can focus on Azeroth. And that's a pretty boring trade up with less personal stake. Generic Speaker for [Spirit], like Aggra and Thrall. He'd be more more interesting if he was involved in dwarven politics.<br />
<br />
I cant quite articulate it, but its nowhere near as interesting as Jaina's comic. She has relationships, politics, and personal motives to work on, Magni's arch is &quot;Save da world!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Have to agree. He also did work on Harbingers, and while I enjoyed Gul'dan and Khadgar's (despite a bit of retconning and confusing messages), Illidan's was a tad bit too edgy for my tastes.<br />
<br />
As for the Jaina comic, it did well when it came to recalling everything about Jaina's past, but... what did the comic accomplish, exactly? It didn't establish anything new (except that hey, Jaina wasn't 100% useless after the Broken Shore incident), and it didn't make me like or sympathize with Jaina any more than I already did (which, spoiler alert, I honestly didn't), if that's what it was trying to do.<br />
<br />
I really liked this one though, because it added some depth to Magni as well as some new things about his past that we didn't know before, while still building around his original character. High hopes for the third and final comic in this series.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The primary function of the Jaina comic, aside from giving insight into her thoughts and emotions regarding past events of her life, was to establish the political climate of Kul Tiras and what drives her to return to help her people in spite of/because of everything that has happened... along with showing that no, she wasn't useless during Legion. She just acted independently from any major organizations. As for your feelings regarding her, Jaina's plight won't be universally sympathized with so that's understandable.<br />
<br />
I do really like this comic, though. Anything that adds a new facet to a character is fantastic. Now I know that Magni's relationship with Azeroth is mirroring his relationship with his daughter. Furthermore, we realize Azeroth's personality is like that of a scared newborn. I like the subversion of a great cosmic entity being seen in a vulnerable state, a mortal state: confusion, pain, a yearning to know what it is, what it is meant to do, what it is meant to be. It lacks guidance, and Magni, who failed to properly guide his daughter and knows the sting of such a failure, has learned from the experience and will be able to do it right this time. It's a chance for him to redeem himself as a poor father.<br />
<br />
I take umbrage with anyone who complains this does not 'progress' the story (not you, by the way, you've been lovely and thought out). A single footstep into a fresh new landscape is better than a thousand miles spent on meaningless, arbitrary change. A proper story must learn to pace itself properly. As small as this story is, it does a lot with what little it gives.</div></div><hr />

Azeroth can't speak to him anymore, and he relates Azeroth to his daughter, and how he cared for her after the death of the Queen.</div></div><hr />
