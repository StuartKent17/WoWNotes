WotLK Beta - Blue posts<br />
Developpers have been very active on forums lately, below you'll find a few more posts about class changes and other important features of WotLK. Some of these changes probably went live with the latest beta build but these days, it's always better to have two confirmations of a change instead of none. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
We think we have a pretty good idea now about what kind of death knight abilities are fun and useful and which ones are clunky or confusing. So now feels like the time to get the death knight into a more shippable state. A big change you'll see in the next patch or two is consolidating death knight diseases. We like the gameplay that evolves from trying to get a disease on a target in order to do cool things. On the other hand, we need to fix<br />
The confusing array of diseases with their different durations, effects and stacking rules.<br />
The crazy number of debuff slots a death knight can occupy on a target.<br />
Diseases not playing well with freezing targets.<br />
Getting a new talented ability only to find that you don't have the runes availble to incorporate it into your rotation.<br />
<br />
The kinds of changes you're likely to see include: meh abilities going away or getting packaged together, talents sliding around in talent trees, and more logical synergies and rotations. We don't want to lose the depth that the class offers and certainly don't want to lose what's fun about being a DK. We'll try and get the official talent trees updated when the changes are ready, because that will explain things better than me trying to do it all here in a wall of text. But I wanted to mention these changes in case it affected any of your feedback on the class. (Which continues to be awesome, in this forum, online and throughout the community.) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557066434&amp;postId=85562766506&amp;sid=1#0))<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
There is a bug right now preventing normalized attacks from doing non-physical damage. Frost Strike will be normalized when that bug is fixed. (Obliterate will also be normalized.)<br />
<br />
But, sadly, instant attacks do less damage than next-swing attacks, since an instant attack also lets you get the full benefit from the normal melee swing. That's why Frost Strike does less damage now. The freezing part wasn't even factored into the damage calculation because we want to mess with that some more... as well as get feedback. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8537833931&amp;postId=85399257312&amp;sid=1#20))<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
The reason Heart Strike is on next swing is you want to be able to get it off before you or your allies do too much damage to an enemy. The earlier you get it off, the better. It can be renewed if it falls off too. I've seen enough people play with it to know that it can feel underwhelming, and a big part of that is because the enemy's hp bar barely moves. You have reduced what &quot;100%&quot; means for the enemy, not knocked it from 100% to 90%. But it is still a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
This is going to be a pretty scary ability in PvP and it's very useful in PvE once you start fighting challenging enemies, like bosses. If you're blasting through things quickly, then there are probably a lot of abilities that seem of questionable use. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8430106264&amp;postId=85369255066&amp;sid=1#17))<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
The damage from Degeneration is supposed to be small, unless you hit a target with a hot on it. It's not a bad way to use up a spare unholy rune most of the time, because you don't always have a lot of options with unholy, but it's not going to do huge damage in a lot of cases. (Now getting a disease on a target period can pay off for a death knight in lots of cases anyway.)<br />
<br />
Unholy Blight can get a stack of diseases on a lot of targets pretty quickly and those diseases can be pretty debilitating depending on your other talents. It's not going to do huge AE damage like say Blizzard or Volley (all channeled AEs do a lot more damage now), but it isn't intended to be just for tanking either. The death knight spells tend to be pretty complex so it's possible we just broke something since we are still iterating on a lot of spells and abilities pretty quickly. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8402820514&amp;postId=85369254870&amp;sid=1#9))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
Maim will break from the same amount of damage that Fear, Entangling Roots etc. breaks with now. It's a flat amount of damage based on the HP pool of the target (its' different for players and creatures), we haven't settled on the right number yet though. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8537784693&amp;postId=85561658456&amp;sid=1#6))<br />

In the future, Hunters will be able to use Master's Call while stunned. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557065707&amp;postId=85561658106&amp;sid=1#6))<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
The exotic pets will be different from normal pets. Ideally they might even be a little bit better, but we're very hesitant to make them too good lest we see every hunter stampede over to the BM tree. Pets are supposed to be something important to all kinds of hunters, and the BM tree already offers some amazing pet buffs and synergy. We just don't want to overdo it with this talent.<br />
<br />
At the very least, the exotic pets will have a new family ability that will ideally be really useful in some situations. I'm making this one up, but imagine that since normal crabs have Pin, an exotic pet might have a Pin-like ability that did fire damage. Or imagine that you could tame a drake (you can't, because they aren't beasts) and that instead of lightning or fire breath, it had frost breath that could freeze an enemy, death knight style. Would this be useful? Probably. Does it make the 51-point talent mandatory? Ideally not. Though those 5 talent points aren't bad....<br />
<br />
As far as what happens if you have an exotic pet and respec, most likely the pet's talents will just reset. Yeah you get a free pet respec out of the deal, but it's not as if it's free since the hunter has to respec. Any exotic pets in the stable won't be lost, but you wouldn't be able to get them out of the stable either. If you have an exotic pet at the moment you respec, then it will probably be dismissed (but not abandoned) and you won't be able to summon it again, forcing you to go swap it into the stable. (Or abandon it if you're THAT kind of hunter.) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202607002&amp;postId=85369255560&amp;sid=1#23))<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
The bottom talents in particular need to have some pretty stringent pre-reqs so that hunters can't just cherry pick all of the active abilities. We can and will iterate on what those pre-req talents are though.<br />
<br />
Active pet abilities in general represent some interesting design challenges. On the one hand, if the hunter just programs the pet and puts it on autopilot, then having unique abilities just sort of blends into a generic +dps for the pet. On the other hand, it would be sad if hunters never took the active abilities because the pet has trouble using the expensive ones and the hunter feels like he already has too many of his own abilities to hit. This is something on which we'll try to hit a reasonable balance. Warlocks seem to have a pretty decent mix of demon abilities that can be used by the demon AI and some that the warlock specifically needs to use.

Mages are still in line for more changes, most of them are talent oriented so it's not really as easy to copy and paste for you. The talent calculator should be updated soon, though. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8402530840&amp;postId=85368455816&amp;sid=1#5))<br />

Lightning Bolt always had a higher coefficient than similar bolt spells. This was because there weren't as much/any nature damage debuffs. Now that they exist, we're restoring Lightning Bolt to it's intended coefficient. Your DPS in a raid setting will if anything be higher with these changes.

You should have to sorta swap between the two based on the situation (water and lightning), based on if you need mana or not. It also sort of has to do with your itemization. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202607403&amp;postId=85368455639&amp;sid=1#13))<br />

We're in the process of re-designing that talent. We definitely want Destro locks to have an advantage from Conflagrate, though. The new Backdraft increases your haste by 10/20/30% and reduces the mana cost by 10/20/30% for your next 3 Destruction spells.

Something like that, also hopefully work in Chaos Bolt in there somewhere (still seeing if we can give that spell better raid/dps utility). Also just boosted the imp's mana regen around 200%, health by 20%, armor by 16% and gave it 80% avoidance (dmg reduction) to AOE's. So he's just about ready to do some business.

We do forsee Affliction Warlocks in raid PvE using Shadow Bolt and Haunt, which are both cast time and capable of critting (so haste and crit do help those). In terms of actual DoTs critting, we currently don't have any intention of doing that. We did make haste lower your GCD, which can help if you want to chain cast DoTs. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8429966288&amp;postId=85368454895&amp;sid=1#7))<br />
Bane should also be working with Haunt (reducing it from 2.0-&gt;1.5), not sure if that was in the talent update or not. Previously we had Haunt at a base 1.5, but this allows us to give it a higher coefficient. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8429966288&amp;postId=85368455578&amp;sid=1#11))<br />
Affliction and Demonology Warlocks should be able to compete on DPS meters for raids, while Affliction may be the best &quot;leveling spec,&quot; it isn't intended to be limited to such.

We've looked into this and verified that the talent calculator is incorrect. Aftermath is now only a two-point talent down from a five-point talent, however the talent is actually providing a 5/10% chance to daze a target off of destruction spells, not 2/4%.

WotLK Multi Talent Spec<br />

Currently we have plans to add account-wide achievements in the future, I just wouldn't expect them at the launch of Wrath of the Lich King.

Actually, the quest achievements do have progress bars. They are broken in the current beta build but you'll see them again as soon as we patch. We'll also have progress bars for the pets as well. We're working on a solution for the Tabard achievement UI. Hopefully, we'll be able to have a progress bar for that one as well.

For basic quest achievements, assume that Daily Quests or any repeatable quest (this includes most world event quests) *DO NOT* count. If an achievement is looking toward a daily quest or repeatable quest, it will specifically mention that or it will mention the specific quest title.

Just to make sure this clear, this achievement is definitely doable by both factions. You will be able to see which zones you haven't fully explored so you can focus on those areas if you want to complete all of them. Yes, exploring the capital cities of the opposing faction can be a little challenging, but so is killing the faction leaders - it just depends on how much effort you plan to put into it.

Zul'aman Bear<br />
The Zul'Aman bear will no longer be available. But the other mounts you mentioned will remain unchanged. The reasoning behind this is that the Zul'Aman bear is obtained during an event which requires precision and skill at level 70. The accomplishment for those who have legitimately earned the mount would be diminished if we continued to allow players to obtain the mount once the level cap is raised to 80.

<br />
Do you think they will add other account wide things?? Like Rep,Honor,Badges,Keys etc etc. I know its pretty easy these days to get all of the above,But after the 10th toon it gets to be a bit much.Would be great to have 1 raiding toon and be able to toss your left over badges to an alt to gear up.<br />

Correct, when the 3.0 patch hits, all your badges can be freely transferred or sold to anyone. <br />
And used as you wish, alts of auction house.<br />
<br />
Epic gem prices will plummet, and everyone will have easy access to epic BT equivalent starter gear on their alts and new death knights. A level playfield just as blizzard intended.<br />

<br />
I feel the opposite way. As someone with a bear mount, I know better than to think that mean anything after a month into WotLK. These items just fade into memory and people either won't recognize them or just laugh at you for celebrating some old challenge. &quot;Hey noob, where's your Malygos mount?&quot;<br />
<br />
Few people care about these old challenges. I don't hear anyone celebrating a Nefarian kill. I hear them mocking those who can't kill Illidan. The bear mount will mean about as much as a Hand of A'dal title does right now. I think Tigole and the others are deluding themselves here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's one bad thing about this game, as long as new content keeps flowing in our pcs/macs, gear, titles, mounts, etc will mean jack squat.<br />
<br />
That's why hopefully this game will eventually have a true lvl CAP and just expand from there, no one will want to lvl from 1-100, etc in 2-3 years and keep having to trash their epics and legendaries for next lvl expansion greens. The accomplishment in WoW will diminish and people will say screw it all.<br />
<br />
Luckily, we're only in our second expansion so those feelings haven't blown up to really notice as much, and with the cool new content, etc, it masks knowing we have to &quot;start all over again&quot;<br />
<br />
i think lvl 80 is a great final lvl cap, with the proceeding expansions being the inclusion of new hero classes and abilities....though..knowing any company...if you have something thats hot, why not stop at 100 instead and round things off?? A smart thing to do would be to skip a new lvl cap at the next expansion and if they really want to push the envelope once again, maybe 85 would be the next stepping stone. Slowing down the jump would make things more interesting.<br />
<br />
WoW 4 Life though...<br />
<br />
Wotlk will be a lot of fun</div></div><hr />

i made no assumptions....only statements...<br />
my point is to state that this game is designed for everyone...not just the people who have no lives...and burn through content in a month...im not saying that if u have good gear then you are one of these types, but merely saying that the game is not designed for people who finish SW in a month and then gripe about how the game isnt hard anymore.</div></div><hr />

To help deal with this issue, in the next data push, Druids should find their melee critical strike chance is about 5% higher.<br />
<br />
The conversion of agility to critical strike chance remains the same 40:1 at level 70, but the base amount for 0 agility has been increased by 5%.<br />
<br />
Lots on Omen of Clarity and even Feral PvP/Range Bug (yes, they are actually acknowledging that Ferals have a problem!)<br />
In the next data push, you will find Omen of Clarity has been changed a bit. The 10 second cooldown has been removed, the procs per minute has been raised from 2 to 3.5, and melee abilities no longer trigger it. Spell interaction with Omen of Clarity remains relatively unchanged, with its hidden chance to trigger off spells reduced by half (and rolling the dice about 2x as often).<br />
<br />
What this means is that more auto-attacks landing on the target will increase the benefit from Omen of Clarity. Haste, increased hit chance, and expertise will all make Omen of Clarity better.<br />
<br />
We are aware of the concerns with reaching the hit rating cap, and will make sure Druids can pick up Rogue items to wear without exceeding that cap. This means Rogues will likely socket for hit, while Druids socket for Strength or Agility.<br />
<br />
Before LK goes live, we will do extensive testing on how much damage classes do, and will increase or decrease their power as appropriate to meet our targets. Cat raid DPS suffered relative to other melee in BC for lack of an Combat Potency equivalent talent (OOC should now be roughly equal), for lack of a scaling finishing move (Savage Roar answers that), for lack of benefitting from Windfury Totem, and for lack of weapon procs (+35 agility != Mongoose). All of those lacks have been addressed. In addition, a change has been made to make the agility rebalance less severe (as I posted in another thread).<br />
<br />
In PvP, we are adding many tools to the Feral Druid arsenal, including the redesigned Maim, Infected Wounds, King of the Jungle, and Berserk. We have also made some improvements to the &quot;range bug&quot;. Attacks that require you to be behind a target will no longer be able to be parried, nor able to be dodged by a player. Our movement engine will now smoothly interpolate positions of moving units, preventing the &quot;Out of range/You must be behind your target/Out of range/You must be behind your target/Out of range/You must be behind your target...&quot; sequence from occuring any more. In addition, being able to apply a snare makes the Feral Druid able to slow down their target and lessen the severity of the &quot;range bug&quot;. Yes, there are still issues with the model, especially when switching into and out of cat form, but many of the issues are being dealt with.<br />
<br />
Druids are not being ignored; this forum is being read daily by developers.<br />

Non-blue theorycraft about this (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202657569&amp;sid=2000&amp;pageNo=2#28), confirmed by Jimmythenumbers in the next post:<br />
<br />
With no cooldown and a 3.5 procs per minute, what this really means is that your melee attacks have a 5.83% (3.5/60) chance of proccing omen of clarity. Capping hit and having expertise makes sure you don't fail to land attacks that might have been hits that proc omen of clarity, and haste means you land more attacks per minute.<br />
<br />
PPM isn't a mechanic where its only possible to have it proc 3.5 times a minute, it means it'll do that on average.<br />
<br />
If you get to 10% haste and land 66 attacks in a minute instead of 60, you now will have 3.85 procs per minute on average.<br />
<br />
Means being hit/expertise-capped will still be useful, and Haste has a greater impact on Feral DPS, at least more of that &quot;nice to have&quot; feeling, since Agility will probably still be superior (once hitcapped)</div></div><hr />

Good luck with that.<br />

That includes Blood Elf Death Knights. Now, don't get me wrong, the colour is appropriate, but the problem is with BLOOD ELF blue eyes since blue eyes on a pale skinned elf means the elf is a High Elf (and thus Alliance loyal). Ah well, have no doubt the hue and texture will be different, but...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After the armored double passenger bear mounts start to cover northrend, people are going to say, &quot;zulaman bear who?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's one bad thing about this game, as long as new content keeps flowing in our pcs/macs, gear, titles, mounts, etc will mean jack squat.<br />
<br />
That's why hopefully this game will eventually have a true lvl CAP and just expand from there, no one will want to lvl from 1-100, etc in 2-3 years and keep having to trash their epics and legendaries for next lvl expansion greens. The accomplishment in WoW will diminish and people will say screw it all.<br />
In related news, each patch that passes the old PvP titles get more and more unique. Even a measly Scout title will be rather unique at level 80. No Draenei, Blood Elf nor Death Knight will ever have those (unless Blizz messes it all up and let us buy them for honour)<br />
<br />
Oh, and there's plans for taking WoW to level 100 from what I hear.</div></div><hr />

Made my day. <br />
<br />
<br />
Heck, that gives me the idea of creating a &quot;Cold-Weather Flying Trainer&quot; guild and just stand there, collecting money from people like Onb. just for pointing them at the quest.</div></div><hr />
