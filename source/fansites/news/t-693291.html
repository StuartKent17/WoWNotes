Yes it seems this bug does relate to our kill. We had no idea that our Rogues using Saronite Bombs in their rotation (as they always do) was causing it and thusly it occured every try we did. Short version, we're not going to stop trying the boss when all we are doing is playing our normal game. It would be nice if these kinds of things, much the same as Holy Wrath on Anub, were tested before release. 
 
It does make the fight easier," />

<br />
It does make the fight easier, but we are 100% sure it would have died either way. It only affects one of the easier phases.<br />
<br />
As a side note this only occured in 25 man.<br />
<br />
Update - It seems that a bug just got hotfixed on live servers, at this point I'm not sure yet if it is related to Ensidia's kill or not. <br />
We just made a hotfix that disables the siege damage dealt by Saronite Bombs and the Global Thermal Sapper Charge. The siege damage of the bombs was causing the Frozen Throne platform to rebuild, which greatly decreases the difficulty of the encounter.<br />
<br />
We'll reenable the siege damage in a later update when the issue with the Frozen Throne is fixed. <br />

Lich King World First Kill by Ensidia<br />
A couple of minutes ago, Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com) became the first guild to defeat the Lich King in 25-Man mode. They are the first guild to unlock the hard modes in Icecrown Citadel-25 and the real challenge will start next week for them and probably a few other guilds. Congratulations to them!<br />

Reminder - The Lich King Loot Table<br />
It took a little longer than intended to get all the screenshots done but here it is, the final loot table for the Lich King encounter! One interesting change with this patch, Heroic items have yellow text and normal items don't.<br />
<br />

<br />
Because they are the same reset, you chose on each boss if it's normal or heroic, it's not a separate raid id like previous raids.</div></div><hr />

It counts as a single instance, there aren't two separate instances for each difficulty.</div></div><hr />

We just made a hotfix that disables the siege damage dealt by Saronite Bombs and the Global Thermal Sapper Charge. The siege damage of the bombs was causing the Frozen Throne platform to rebuild, which greatly decreases the difficulty of the encounter. <br />
<br />
We'll reenable the siege damage in a later update when the issue with the Frozen Throne is fixed.</div></div><hr />

It's VERY easy to tell that they used the Sapper charge mechanic on the platform.<br />
<br />
Well, it's still a world first, but what happens now? Do people just push it under the rug?<br />

If they cheated its not a clever use. These are professional gamers, i didnt realize &quot;alleged&quot; exploiting of game mechanics is something to be proud of. This is no world first kill for ensidia unless they did indeed not use the method that has been corrected.</div></div><hr />

Everyone complains about what a faceroll PVE is, yet your congratulating the supposed &quot;best players&quot; in the world for cheating in such an easy game. no skill was shown here other than the ability to find an exploit and utilize it. <br />

They don't brag for the kill or cause a world first. This is no different than the Yogg 0 crap which caused another guild to get a 3 day ban. It's easy comparing Blood Legions screenshot to Ensidias to see that they used it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Yes it seems this bug does relate to our kill. We had no idea that our Rogues using Saronite Bombs in their rotation (as they always do) was causing it and thusly it occured every try we did. Short version, we're not going to stop trying the boss when all we are doing is playing our normal game. It would be nice if these kinds of things, much the same as Holy Wrath on Anub, were tested before release.<br />
<br />
It does make the fight easier, but we are 100% sure it would have died either way. It only affects one of the easier phases.<br />

Now even IF they didn't intend on doing that it still is pretty common sense that is was something players were doing that was causing it. Now maybe they truly were ignorant to why it was happening (although to bring all the platforms back like that shows some intent) I wouldn't consider this kill a true world first since it trivializes the encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Arthas spawns Val'kyrs which pick up raid members and drop them over the edge, where the shattered edge was, if that edge is there you can ignore this mechanic entirely. Additionally there is a mechanic which makes you spread out, but you can't do it too far, or the Val'kyr won't have to travel far to drop you off the edge.<br />
<br />
Having the edge in these phases completely removes the only two parts of the fight that actually make this fight NOT patchwerk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ensidia Gets World First Hardmodes Unlocked. Then they report a bug they used to kill the boss, a bug which will now &quot;greatly decreases Increases the difficulty&quot;. Now guilds are going to fight LK Normal mode, at the difficulty intended. Thus Ensidia, has once again, close the door behind them to HM World Firsts. <br />
<br />
IIRC - This happened in Ulduar, SSC, Sunwell, then trace back select players to even AQ40.<br />
<br />
The excuse &quot;we didnt know&quot; is garbage too. Oh &quot;something is causing the fight to Bug, but lets continue to exploit this unknown bug until we kill it.&quot; - Yeah and Exodus didnt know a pally sitting in Yoggs room was causing Guardians to evade bug.<br />

<br />
All Rogues should use that in their rotation, if they can, but did they have to pop it after the platform was down, or was popping it in the beginning of the fight blocking it for the entire fight?

Meanwhile here's what they said in relation to Exodus's exploited 1st on Yogg +0 many months back:<br />
<br />
&quot;We found the exploit that makes phase 3 a tank and spank and the easiest phase of the whole fight almost instantly (its so easy to pull off, im suprised it took this long for a guild to use it), of course we arent going to kill it like that&quot; -Zemme of Ensidia<br />

And their &quot;professional&quot; gamers. They knew something was up, claiming ignorance is foolish. if they found a bug &quot; and yes they knew something was wrong in the fight&quot; then they should report it. <br />

Cheating is not acceptable. especially when WoW is already a faceroll according to the posts i read. <br />

If their rogues consistently used saronite bombs in all their rotations i would assume this would appear in combat logs from other fights, not sure if the &quot;bestlol&quot; guild posts their logs.</div></div><hr />

You are sad if you don't see the difference between the two kills. The &quot;exploit&quot; is a part of their rogues normal rotation, how where they supposed to know what was causing the bug? Exodus (seems to be a forgotten guild) on the other hand used a mechanic they knew was wrong, and did something that wasn't natural to get to it.<br />

Having the edge in these phases completely removes the only two parts of the fight that actually make this fight NOT patchwerk.<br />
Thank you for the information. I personally haven't made it to Arthas yet, so I wasn't sure what I was looking for after this bug fix.<br />
<br />
Since they have done the 10-man, and did 10 attempts on 25-man, it'd be ignorant to assume they didn't know what they were doing. Having an entire mechanic of the fight cut out?<br />
<br />
I realize this is only the second day of the patch, but it's my personal belief that instead of rushing to the kill, they would have done the honorable thing and reported it before they killed him. Not only does it insult the other guilds who are trying very hard to clear the content in the race for world first status, but it spawns a lot of hatred/flaming/elitism on all sides of every fence. It raises the question, are they even capable of clearing Arthas as he was intended to be fought?<br />
<br />
If they can't do it again next week, I guess we'll have our answer.<br />
<br />
It's things like this that completely invalidate the &quot;World First&quot; anything- the instant hotfix that closes gates, breaks spirits, and encourages exploiting as long as it wins you the gold.<br />
<br />
Seeing Arthas thoroughly tested over the next few weeks -should- mean that it won't be possible to exploit through the Heroic kills (the only ones that should matter, assuming they are properly tuned and bug/exploit-free).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I beg to differ. They used a way to get into the brain when you where not supposed to be able to be there, and having a lock and a pally inside made the fight a joke. The only hard element was removed. <br />
<br />
Ensidia, speaking about Hodir, added some mobs to the fight, and beat it with not even a second to spare. The fight was overtuned, and already beaten, something that would have given Method and IS (?) an advantage. If adding the mobs would have led to a one min kill, it would clearly be something to ban for, but with not even one second to spare, it's different. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Whoever says we &quot;exploited&quot; intentionally. How crazy are you? How on EARTH do you think we went in there on a boss where you have 20 tries, &quot;OH ok lets use tries to test if saronite bombs is going to rebuild the platform, because its SO OBVIOUS that it will!&quot;<br />
<br />
It happened on every try at one point or another and we had no idea what caused it and thats all i need to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
In all honestly, if you have limited attempts on a boss and a floor magically respawns out of nowhere making the encounter surely easier. What would you do? You have no clue WHY this is happening, we all thought it was a bug in the coding rather then Saronite Bombs (?). What would you have done, wiped and wasted a try every time it happened? There is a huge difference between exploits and &quot;exploits&quot;, knowing how to actually bug something and abuse it (aka lets stand in yoggs brain and make adds evade lol), is totally different from &quot;using&quot; a bug that can't really be explained nor prevented.<br />
<br />
What Mackzter and Poptisse said. Call me butthurt or what ever, but this doesn't sound too increadible to be true. Or did they &quot;omgomgomgomgomgomg we found an exploit, Muqq and Munken, start making a story about how it 'really' happened&quot;? I Believe them.</div></div><hr />

Put yourself in the shoes of a top 25 man guild who have had 3-4 wipes on LK25 on under 10%.. You then read that Ensidia exploit it, report it and make your fight a shit load harder. You think that's fair?<br />

Any top-end raiding Rogue with the Engineering profession should know this and this has long been part of the min-max theorycrafting on the Rogue subforum on EJ.<br />
<br />
If Saronite Bomb is not used on every cooldown, then the total effective DPS gained from Engineering will be lower than the static 60 AP bonuses provided by other professions. If it is used on every cooldown, the total gain will be significantly higher.<br />
<br />
As a rogue, I find Ensidia's explanation perfectly logical. As to whether they still deserve the &quot;honor&quot; of being world first in spite of this accidental exploit, that's a discussion I will not go into.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 tries.<br />
<br />
Apparently, there's an aura, or something, at the center of the platform, forcing players to stay as far away as they can. However, Valkyrs pick up players and fly them away as fast as possible, and (if i understand correctly) dps has to kill the valkyrs before the players are flown off.<br />
<br />
Without this exploit, depending on how far away from the center they could handle, i'd assume maybe a few seconds to kill the valkyr or do whatever to make it drop the player?<br />
and, With the exploit... the valkyr drops the player onto the outside platform.<br />
<br />
At first i thought, maybe they just didn't notice. but seriously, why the HECK would blizzard have Arthas summon Valkyrs to HELP you by flying you away from the bad aura in the center of the room?? this is OBVIOUSLY not intended.<br />
<br />
also since when does a platform magically reappear? if ensidia had half the brains to be able to get to the Lich King, they'd realize that respawning platforms isn't intended.<br />
Finally, why the hell did they all switch to engineering for the encounter, AFTER they had their first couple attempts, and then switch back and bug report asap.<br />
<br />
there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY they were ignorant/clueless.<br />

Yes, their kill was accompanied by an UNKNOWN bug that made the fight easier. Someone else said it perfectly &quot;Would you stop the fight and wipe every time it happened, knowing that you only had a limited number of attempts?&quot; It wasn't even clear what was causing the bug. I know plenty of Rogues that use Saronite Bombs in their rotation, it's not uncommon. <br />
<br />
There are two kinds of people in this thread:<br />
A) Those who are jealous<br />
and<br />
B) Those who show respect where respect is earned<br />
<br />
Personally, I haven't seen past the Plagueworks, I haven't been able to play in a few weeks, something that has hurt my guild tremendously. We were never in a position to jockey for the first Lich King kill. Chances are, most of you crying in here aren't either. <br />
<br />
I know that if a bug was occurring during a fight, I wouldn't sit down and wipe, I would push on, no matter what the situation, I'm not surprised they kept going in a World First situation. Quit raging on unofficial forums, and give the guild the respect they earned. Plenty of guilds won't even make it to the Lich King this week, let alone with more than 10 tries left, that is a feat in and of itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fight is probably the same just from what they say the exploit doesnt occur in 10 man, here's a screenshot from they're kill in 10man<br />

No your not, everyone just said it was clever use of game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Now ensidia come along and there Rogues use there normal dps rotation using there saronite bombs and this happens to 'cause this slight bug; it's not like it completely trivialised the fight, it made a simple part of the fight just alittle easier, nothing more.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the majority of people posting here haven't even seen the fight, heck I bet most of them are getting stuck on Saufang now he's been &quot;buffed&quot;; I know ALOT of other top guilds will kill it before the end of the week, no biggie.<br />
<br />
Why is it that when some guilds do &quot;exploits&quot; people call it clever use of game mechanics, yet every time I see Ensidia get a kill people jump to the conclusion that they've exploited there way to it(Like everyone saying they all changed to Blood Elves to make Anub'arak Heroic easier), seriously people jsut get of your high horses and respect that these people are simply better than you at this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure other guilds running 25man also ran into this, because being a top guild you'd have your raiders having there best professions; with engineering being sucha good profession I have no doubt that plenty of other guilds on the encounter ran into this, yet no-one has said anything about it.</div></div><hr />

Actually, using Saronite Bombs is an easy way to put in more dps as a melee class, as they're cheap to make, is instant cast, and doesn't trigger the GCD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pathetic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
actually, that DOESNT work here, because they either: <br />
<br />
a. used the same bug, therefor would be as much guilty if they had the first kill and have no right to complain<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
b. didnt use bug and were doing it with normal difficulty, therefor it would have NO effect on the difficulity of their fight.<br />

I remember at Yogg when they didnt manage to get the world first zero watchers. Obviously they found the bug exo used, reported it and called the raid.<br />
<br />
Now, why didnt they just report the bug this time aswell? If any other guild would have killed it with the bombs, it would be the same thing. They could still have killed him legit after the fix was applied since &quot;he would have been dead anyway&quot;, right?</div></div><hr />

You must not raid much.<br />
I know at least 5 Rogues that use Saronite Bombs on cooldown in their rotation. It's a free 1000 Damage that's off the GCD, who wouldn't use it? Add that to the fact that Engineering gives other buffs that increase DPS, and you have a very solid profession.</div></div><hr />

so? like many have said, even if they knew; what should they do about it? I sure wouldnt stop just cause things go different, if the game i pay for is bugged i'll play it until it kicks me out of the game cause the bug is a critical one, they're not exploiting not even slightly, the exodus was an exploit, is like when you fight van cleef and have the healer put the adds on evade, they knew it would happened and they exploited it, now ensidia didnt even know why it was happening, it just was and it's because blizzard didnt fix the bug before hand, they didnt exploit the gameplay, it just happened.</div></div><hr />

Ya but whoops or no whoops, it's always them, they know how the game works so well that they know what they're doing to get around things, it's a talent in itself tbh, if it was so easy to exploit to get world first then world first would go to all sort of random guilds.</div></div><hr />

Blizz says it made it considerably easier and they respond with oops didnt know and wouldnt have made a difference. doesnt sound like much of an explanation for a guild that breaks down attempts and &quot;thinks outside the box&quot; a lot. Would really like to see their gchat or raid chat during this day and fraps. But that will never happen. Imo ban and achievement strip just like they have sought for other guilds.<br />

They &quot;should&quot; know platforms reappearing in 25 mode is a bug since it didn't happen in 10?<br />
Gimme a break, remember how the community cries &quot;25 men bugged there's only 1 abom in prof&quot;<br />
NO ONE knows whether it's part of mechanic or not until blue/GM clarify. I blame blizzard's QA.<br />
Blizzard never disclose boss strat. who knows if saronite bomb spawning platform isn't part of the fight?<br />
<br />
&quot;YES saronite bomb is part of the fight, just as we assume there'll be a priest in 25 raid we think it's fair to assume there'll be engineer in a 25men fight&quot;<br />

<br />
Now I don't know how the bug works, but lets look at what is known. Do you really think a competitive guild like Ensidia didn't do any research on the Lich King encounter? It has been known for a long time that the floor breaks away. Do you really think that there were no visual clues to the exploit after 20 something attempts? <br />
<br />
I don't know for sure, but I've read some comments about them killing him in 10-man first. Do you really think they thought that the encounter would be different in 25-man, the only thing being the floor doesn't break?<br />

Yeah was going to mention that. Also the bonuses from JC/BS, which they had before, were much better for PvE. It's pretty weird that they suddenly switched. <br />
<br />
<br />
I fail to see why this &quot;LOL everyone rerolled engineering to exploit the kill&quot; is standing as some kind of plausable statement.<br />
<br />
It would ONLY REQUIRE ONE ENGINEER TO USE ONE BOMB TO CAUSE THE BUG. Seriously, some people need to use there heads before posting.<br />

It's on a 1 minute cooldown. That's too long to exploit it to the extent that they did is why.</div></div><hr />

If saronite bombs were part of a rogues rotation (at competitive levels) and blizzard likes to test their encounters in lots of ways, how would they miss something so standard in a hardcore dps rotation. especially if the use of the bombs is talked about on EJ and in various logs of boss fights.<br />

Off the top of my head Aryu a mage (since when is that a good mage prof) and Mek their shaman. I am basing this off their statistics page which shows what they recently got and in their case that was engineering recipes. It's not a 100% thing but the 2 classes/specs with it right there is kinda awkward for a guild all about min/maxing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wheres the source on this? Right now it looks like only 5 had engineering on the kill. And those 5 had it pre-patch...<br />
<br />
Although I still think that a guild as high up in the ranks as Ensidia should of known better, surely they would of noticed. They are meant to be the 'best' for a reason. Or it could be completely innocent and just a buggy encounter.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeh, I totally forget that The Lich king repeatedly cast the spell to destroy the platforms every 10 seconds, require you to have a rotation of bomb throwing so the platform rebuilt themselves to make the encounter easier.<br />
<br />
So again, why would you need everyone to throw bombs, when one bomb would do the job after he'd already destroyed the sides once?</div></div><hr />

We continue to closely monitor all 25 player Lich King attempts and will take action if we deem players blatantly exploiting the encounter. <br />

Since bombs are part of normal dps rotation I don't see it as &quot;blatantly exploiting the encounter&quot;. Unless you can prove &quot;hey they throw bombs JUST to make platform reappear&quot;</div></div><hr />

I would certainly hope so. This is ridiculous the most iconic character in the entire warcraft series defeated by exploiters. Should ensidia get the world first kill on the most iconic boss in the game, Yea i think they should ive played for 5 years and this is their game as theyve made clear by their dedication and skill?. Instead they choose to &quot;slap blizzard in the face&quot; with a clear exploit. <br />
<br />
Should the world first and achievements be rewarded by using a clearly obvious exploit NO. they certainly should not. Spanking ensidia would set a precedent that cheating is not tolerated by Blizzard ( i already thought it wasnt). Bad way to build into the competitive new battle.net system imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
I can't fathom how a bug such as this would escape Blizzard. There'd eventually be thousands of engineers fighting the Lich King and I'm fairly sure a substantial amount of them would use the Saronite Bombs. The GCD-free damage from it makes it benificial to add in a rotation where you can without any penalty whatsoever, people would use it and Blizzard should've expected it. In fact, judging from the bug that could destroy Wintergrasp gates and the hotfix of that, they should've known there were issues with the charges doing siege damage and at least had it on a &quot;What if..?&quot; list but apparently, the internal testing at Blizzard HQ isn't very sound.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the stuns on Anub'arak for that matter. I can understand the bugg on Yogg being harder to catch since it's not as easy as just pressing a given skill randomly but require a setup, but something as simple as using a profession or an ability that makes sense? I do not see how they can miss that, but eh, if they want to released bugged encounters then that's their choice. It does, however, seem natural that they might be better off actually increasing the playtesting or replacing some of the people in the QA section to actually smooth out such flaws.<br />
A whole year's build up and they drop the ball on the one encounter that everyone would focus on? Tad ridiculous isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Its hard to find whats 'cause a bug, then you did exactly the same thing in the 10man encount and said bug didnt occur. Maybe it was setting down totems at a certain time, maybe it was a warlock portal, maybe it was a mage blinking or maybe the engineering boots changed it?<br />
<br />
If you do exactly the same as you have always done, but then a boss suddenly bugs out; your first reaction would be that the boss is bugged. Seeing that this boss has been out just over a day, not many people know its true mechanics(Maybe 10man was bugged and that the platforms were supposed to rebuild, but they didnt in 10man for some reason?[whish we know now isn't true, but at the time there was nothing suggesting it wasn't true]).<br />
<br />
Another reason for so many rerolling engineering is because its more favourable to certain spec with ICC gear. Lets talk about specs with ArP, before 3.3 it was hard to hit the cap with gear, so being BS/JCing would give you them extra gems to get close to the gap. Now that ICC gear is out, with alot more ArP, then you dont need these extra gems/gem slots(bearing in mind, these we're the only two profesions boosting ArP afaik), then you can hit the ArP cap with normal gear, so Engineering would be a better profession as it adds other things to your DPS that you can use.<br />
<br />
Someone talked about Mek rerolling Engineering; For elemental shamans engineering is a great profession, popping EM + Gloves haste thing is practically a 2nd heroism, bringing LB down to 1 second casts; and mages using this can do the same, proccing all CDs and gloves enchant = mighty DPS boost.<br />

There will always be things missed and that is balanced against their desire to keep things out of circulation to add some gravitas to the encounter. The game has lost something by people knowing everything about a fight before they even set foot inside the instance, but to not learn it is to limit yourself. <br />
<br />
Blizzard relies on people to advise them of any problems they miss and trusts them not to abuse any issues that arise, they then generally take swift action - as they have in this case - to correct it. There has to be balance and while people like to focus on the negative the fight will be fine when most people get to it.<br />
<br />
As others have said the real question is &quot;Did Ensidia know?&quot; if they did they clearly accepted that they were utilising an exploit and should therefore accept any consequences. If they really didnt know well thats what we call an accident and well accidents happen, chalk it up and move on.<br />

Use of abilities in an intended manner (spamming Holy Wrath) is one thing, use of abilities that causes the fight to behave in a manner that it clearly should not is another. <br />
<br />
Even allowing for that fact that they might not have known exactly what was causing the platform to respawn, they surely had to know that something was. They had completed it on 10M. They knew. To maintain legitimacy, their best recourse would have been to report that something was causing the floor to respawn, sit and wait. Anyone who completed the encounter before the cause of the bug was hotfixed, would have their kills reviewed. Ensidia looks the hero for saving the integrity of the encounter while refraining from cheesing it. They chose to continue on and complete an obviously bugged encounter, report their kill, then report the bug, locking access to it for guilds on teh same level. <br />
<br />
It looks highly suspicious, and is not becoming of a world class guild. But hey, the fact that everyone is calling them on it is enough for me. Hopefully, the truth will out.</div></div><hr />

However saronite bombs are not on the GCD, and even if they were rogues have free GCD's due to waiting energy.

<br />
<br />
1) If you go into 10man Arthas do the fight and then go into 25 man Arthas, and you find the behavior is significantly altered (platforms that were never there suddenly re-appearing) causing the fight to become much easier red warning lights and flags should be going off in your head.<br />
<br />
2) I know of several people who have actually went and picked up Engineering specifically for the Saronite Bomb abilities. Our mage and guild leader had done this change several weeks ago and worked it into his rotation, so I can believe that other classes had done the same.<br />
<br />
3) Given Ensidia/Nihilium's history with previous notable bosses:<br />
--C'thun<br />
-- Vashj<br />
--Mimiron<br />
--Hodir<br />
---After Exodus exploited Yogg+0 and how quickly Ensidia was able to pick up on the exploit and &quot;totally report it&quot;<br />
-- Anub (I'm speculating on this one if they discovered the holy wrath and used it or not)<br />
---and now Arthas....<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm unfortunately finding too much of a pattern in the above trend to really begin taking them at face value as they shrug and say &quot;Oopsies! We would have got it anyways.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sadly, we will never know and this very notable boss is, once again, mired in controversy, US vs EU e-peen wagging and forum flames.....that's very unfortunate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerts</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about this Saronite Bombs/Thermal Sapper.<br />
<br />
This &quot;cleans&quot; their innoncense to me.<br />
Does the floor rebuilds JUST where the explosion was, or is it &quot;one bomb in mid repairs ALL floor in the room&quot;?<br />
<br />
If it was first, Sorry you cannot say &quot;Oh we didn't know&quot;, cause then blowing things up where the boss wasn't is just ...well. Enough said about that.<br />
<br />
If second, then it's bug, not a cheat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless of how the floor actually comes back into the equation, the fact that it does is the biggest problem with their defense. It wouldn't have been that serious if they had not already defeated the Lich King on 10 man difficulty, their &quot;ignorance&quot; would have been legitimate. The problem lies in the fact that they knew before hand every mechanic this fight had to offer, and openly admitted that the return of the floors made a phase &quot;easier&quot;.<br />
<br />
Where does the line get drawn is the question. Had they not killed the Lich King you could certainly chalk it up to ignorance, though even then the floors falling off were a well known part of the encounter. <br />
<br />
Either way, you can't take what Ensidia said as truth, but you definitely can't listen to everyone that's mindlessly insulting them either. Use logic.<br />
<br />
They knew the mechanics of the fight, they knew something was wrong as evident in their response to the discovery and subsequent hotfix, they decided to continue regardless of a bug that was more than obvious.<br />
<br />
It's an exploit, plain and simple, even if it was unintentional; taking advantage of a bug, accidental or not, is an exploit.<br />
<br />
In Molten Core days, Conquest was banned for ice trapping the adds on Gehennas and were banned for a long time before they got it lifted. That was clever use of mechanics, this is bypassing a fight they already knew the mechanics to.<br />
<br />
Action should be taken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you dont know how a fight is supposed to go(no data on the fight was datamined until the patch went live) then how are you supposed to know whats bugged and whats not. Just because they did 10man first doesn't mean 10man was the non-bugged encounter. If everyone had done 25man first, then done 10man and found the platforms not reappearing, would you say theres a bug with the 10man?<br />
<br />
&quot;But hey, the fact that everyone is calling them on it is enough for me.&quot; - So you saying because everyone else is splurting out mindless comments, you just gonna go with the flow and expect everyone else to be right?<br />
<br />
This isn't compareable to the Exodus exploit of Yogg0, what they did was turn the hardest part of a fight(p1+2 are really easily done once you get yourselves set, p3 iswas the big race and RNG part); they essentially stopped all incoming damage, leave you to just dps the boss down until it was dead, basically turning Yogg into a target dummy.<br />
<br />
What happend here didnt stop LK from attacking, didn't stop any AoE damage, didn't turn LK into a target dummy; it didnt effect ONE aspect of the fight, one which isn't even that hard(Just gotta DPS the add down before it reaches the edge, seeing as the add doesn't have massive hitpoints it wasn't exactly hard before-hand).</div></div><hr />

When you only have 20 attempt on him max and you might wipe on 1%, every bit of dps matters.<br />

<br />
It's not &quot;holes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Look at the outside of the whole platform, you can even see where it's supposed to break in the Ensidia picture. For reference, use the grey point that is near the edge in both of them.<br />
<br />
It could just be the angle Blood Legion takes the picture, but the platform is much longer in Ensidia's picture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Besides the fact that a few live streams of the encounter were up, and no one (blizzard employees included who you know damn well were keeping an eye on those) seemed to have a problem with how those kills went. So obviously that was they way the fight was supposed to work. Then they get into 25M and the mechanics are set up to make that phase of the fight easier? Be serious. Use logic. It would be ass backwards to assume that the 25 man version was set up to be easier than 10, and the 10 man had already been completed with no issues cropping up, so there would be no reason to beleive that it was the bugged version.<br />

I'm not just going with the flow. I'm presenting valid arguments, and I'm only speaking about the other people who are doing the same. Read my post. I am not putting Ensidia on blast as cheaters. I'm merely pointing to the fact that if they wanted a legitimate and undeniable claim to FIRST! then they should have tried their best to complete the encounter under unquestionable circumstances. Especially considering their spotty past.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully we will manage to kill the Lich King with our alt raid in Normal but the DPS requirements seem quite high!<br />

This was before the bug came out. I don't really buy it, their alts also farmed totgc insanity before icecrown came out, their alts have also been farming all ICC 10/25 content since it's come out- the DPS of their alts isnt going to be much lower. Knowing they killed it exploiting a bug however, now that could make them question their abbility to have their alts kill it.<br />

<br />
Makes me lol a bit.<br />
<br />
On a serious note, the guild is so devoted to the game that i really don't think that the exploits won them the fight. Each raider in Ensidia has an ALT of the same class which they use in their other 25 man run. Giving them more times to see fights and also more time learn shit. Not as if thats needed, but in a game where everything is gated and that determines progression, the insane people who are willing to go the extra mile are the ones on top. In this case its a guild like Ensidia. (Again, I know they don't even need it, but if they did, they have it there available).<br />

They figured out some part of the encounter wasn't triggering correctly if they used them consistently, and didn't bother to stop so they could get their precious 'first'. <br />

Exactly, its price for having it new and exciting to all encountering that fight. Tbh this is totally Blizzards fault in testing department, as they should be using same way normal guilds kill him - aka even having eng using free dps boost every cd.<br />
I was a bit sceptical when Ensidia confirmed that this wasnt done in 10m but cant blame them for going for fast kill (world first) instead of doing testing for Blizzard and lose their limited attemps.<br />
