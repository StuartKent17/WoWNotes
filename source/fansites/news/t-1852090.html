Armory Stats - Races and Genders<br />
Today we are taking a look at character races and genders. The last time we looked at this data was in 2011 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2407-Character-Gender-Ratios-Blue-Posts-Fan-Wallpaper-TCG-Artworks) and things have changed since then. New character models were added and every race now has a higher percentage of female characters. Tauren, Dwarves, and Undead had the smallest increase, while Draenei, Night Elves, and Blood Elves had the largest. Night Elves and Blood Elves went from being a majority of male to a majority of female characters.<br />
<br />
The data today is based on 6.1 million characters that have been active since June 1, 2015. The first chart shows character genders for each race, only within that race. This means that each race will add up to 100%. You can click on the titles in the legend to turn on and off different data series.<br />
<br />
The second chart shows character genders for each race, but weighted to their overall proportion. This allows you to see that even with the new character models, Female Dwarves are still the least popular. <br />
<br />
The final chart shows the races without gender specific information. <br />

Crystallized Fel loot from Archimonde resets together with weekly LFR Reset OR with norm/heroic/mythic reset ?<br />
This resets with weekly quest tracking, as do all other Legendary quest steps. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/634851503799296000))<br />
<br />
UI<br />
Any hope to fix Tab-Targetting? Been broken since 6.x: https://gfycat.com/NeighboringUnimportantEchidna<br />
Appreciate the report. We're currently investigating this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/634861199851581440))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
How much of an impact(if any) do you think Activision has had on the creative process of Blizzard?<br />
None. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/632386047503003648))<br />
<br />
Love hard dungeons, but hard as in coordinating CC, using interrupts, stuns, ect. One shot death mechanics = not fun.<br />
Agree, but they often go together. If it's is just &quot;lots of damage&quot; the healer gets blamed. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/632937347517050881))<br />
<br />
Do you think convenience is a double edged sword? at what point does clicking menus/teleports jeopardize the RPG in MMORPG?<br />
Fast travel is a risk in a lot of games. The Witcher 3, a great game, risks losing its sense of world from click to teleport. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/632936972827291648))<br />
I get why players like it. I like it. But I don't think we always recognize what we are giving up for convenience. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/632937105635676160))<br />
<br />
I'm curious... if he'll answer... what community has worse personal attacks on its designers? WoW or LoL?<br />
WoW in my experience. I think it has something to do with long term investment in a character which feels like higher stakes. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/633050270495191040))<br />
Also I guess with LoL you know exactly what you're getting into, but people play WoW for many reasons. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/633050461860331520))<br />
However it's also possible I'm just more experienced communicating now and may fewer flubs. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/633050758741495808))<br />
Riot and Blizzard also have very different communication styles. Blizzard practices polish so players expect that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/633050899334586368))<br />

That will be the main reason for some, but I doubt for the majority. Human characters are the easiest to associate to. For many, they were also the only choice for playing a paladin (because they don't like to be short or tentacled).</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure there is dwarf paladins? &gt;.&gt; Wait misread short, lol think gnomes as short.</div></div><hr />

Human males and females gear is perfectly proportioned without tiny shoulderpads or weapons, as are orcs and for the most part taurens. Blood elf females and Draenei females have tiny little shoulderpads, but are the go to pretty character if you just want something that will look good and curvy. <br />
<br />
Night elves are pretty good too with the gear scale.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dwarf females, goblins, and gnomes just look comical and you can't see a lot of the armor pieces like the chest piece and stuff with it already being 2d texture anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also do not find human male% that surprising as human male will be the &quot;default&quot; choice for many male players as they are the easiest to associate with. As female Night Elves and Blood elves are rather &quot;conventionally attractive&quot; feminine models, I can guess that female players have it much easier to associate with those races as well, making up for the greater disparity. As clumsy as the male human is still looking, he isn't &quot;ugly&quot; enough and is modeled after a general &quot;heroic shape&quot; which puts him right into the &quot;standard male player's&quot; comfort zone ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Insofin</div><div class="date">2015-08-25, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you put the male and female ratios of 2011 and 2015, it would have been great that you also added the % of a race representation of 2011, so that we can see which classes have picked new players. For example, humans represent nowadays 19.35% of the playerbase, maybe in 2011 it was 14.75%? Just a random number, it's an example.<br />
<br />
<br />
That will be the main reason for some, but I doubt for the majority. Human characters are the easiest to associate to. For many, they were also the only choice for playing a paladin (because they don't like to be short or tentacled).<br />
It would have been great to add the % of human representation before the racial got changed.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
Regarding the statistics. My very first character was a male tauren, that got deleted at level 5 due to a &quot;bad decision with the realm&quot; (it was back in vanilla and my friends had their alliance toons in the realm I decided to start) so I had to delete the character and ended up creating a male human warlock instead.<br />
<br />
However, as time went by, I ended up having enough with male characters. To me, most of the male characters are less attractive visually than the female ones. And I'm not talking about females having a nice chest or ass. I talk about male characters being most of them moles of muscle extremely oversized. The only male races I play are: Dwarves (because female dwarves... how about no), gnomes (I play some, but 3 out of my 4 gnomes are females also), taurens (same reason with female dwarves), undeads (50-50, I like both of them) and my main human (the only one), because I don't want to race change it. I must add that male trolls, night elves and orcs rock, but female versions rock even more. To me, female trolls have the best set of hair models in the game, followed up by the female worgen's set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen. Tried every race for my main apart from troll before I got to female Orc. Haven't race changed since. They look bad-ass in just about anything at that.</div></div><hr />

No wonder since Blizzard designs armor for Orcs &amp; Humans and merely slaps them on the other races as a resize.<br />
<br />
@20% humans: 1)PvP 2) most people actually try to recreate themselves in games like this. So it's natural that humans will have the largest representation.<br />

What was he going to say? &quot;Yes.&quot;?<br />

Even if he did personally agree that Activision has had a negative effect on Blizzard to some extent, there's no way he'd ever publicly say it, regardless of where he works now. That would be like the president confirming Area 51 after leaving Office.</div></div><hr />

I agree about the orc female model, it's without a doubt the best model on the horde-side. Armor just looks good and proportional overall. I do prefer the alliance races overall tho, sadly I'm sticking to horde.</div></div><hr />

As female Night Elves and Blood elves are rather &quot;conventionally attractive&quot; feminine models, I can guess that female players have it much easier to associate with those races as well, making up for the greater disparity. From all the females I've met in the game I'd say most popular combos they picked so far was female nelf resto druid and female human mage. Don't ask me why. Since I didn't play much horde since WOTLK can't say how is it on the other faction, but I'd wager Blood Elves take the lead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't surprise me since WoW often adds large amounts of content and changes it's game systems completely around every now and then and so devs are much more in the spotlight and have much more influence on the individual gaming experience than on LoL where they only do some balancing and add some heroes. It's not that they come up with stuff like &quot;We don't believe in multiple lanes anymore so we remove them&quot; or try to force all players into dominion.<br />
<br />
You can't really compare those.</div></div><hr />

It can't be that hard to fix. I just started playing SWTOR and the tab targeting in that game has never targeted the mob 50 yards behind me. <br />
<br />
And the targeting system in SWTOR also seems to recognize that you just encountered 3 mobs and targets the next mob in that group automatically...none of this encounter 3 mobs stuff, kill 2 and have to re-target the 3rd mob that is standing in front of you punching you in the face.<br />
<br />
If they can do it it intelligently in SWTOR surely they can do it in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alliance has always been the slightly more popular faction. Humans have been the most popular race since vanilla. Blood Elves have been the most popular Horde race by far (I think they were like 3 to 1 at one point) since TBC.<br />
<br />
Has nothing to do with game mechanics and everything to do with people in general preferring avatars that aesthetically appear like a normal person (albeit a bodybuilder or a supermodel).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure this goes beyond MMOs. Every RPG in general that had race options tended to be human dominated... well those that bothered to collect and publish those statistics anyway.<br />
<br />
As for WoW. My Dwarf Female Warlock is one of my favorite and most played characters. She is the only one I've bothered to get all professions to max on, anyway. I'd probably play her a lot more if it weren't for my frustration with the warlock class atm.</div></div><hr />

To add to this, there is also the issue of Humans being..well..Humans.<br />
<br />
Even in RPGs without real racial differences except looks the &quot;Human&quot; race is usually the most often picked one. SImply because there is a large group of people who are more comfortable with playing something &quot;familiar&quot; instead of a spacegoat or a ped pandabear.</div></div><hr />

Dwarves are the only race that I can enjoy in alliance faction, and females more than males, they r strong women and have alot of personality and awesome hairstyles (plus they have incredibles animations for casters and melees classes).<br />
<br />
Everybody tell me &quot;another dwarf fem?&quot; and no ones question the other players that have ...mmmmm... 7 human females charas? terrible. <br />
Luckily, since cata, dwarves have all combo classes except druid, thx Blizzard :)<br />
<br />
<br />
pd: my paladin is a fem dwarf too <br />
pd2: I hate humans in every fantasy game...boredddddddd raceeeeeeeeeee...</div></div><hr />

People play with what's familiar and what's easiest to relate to. Others have said the same thing. I remember when Dragon Age Inquisition was still in development. At one point, there were only going to be humans, then dwarves and elves got added. After some begging, qunari also got added. Reason why Bioware was going to only go with humans (like they did with Dragon Age 2) was because so few players played the other races in Dragon Age Origins. It wasn't worth the development time and money for them to add something that appealed to a tiny percentage of the player base. Ultimately, they changed their mind which was likely due to the game being given another year of development. If the game came out a year sooner, humans would have likely been the only playable race.<br />
<br />
I have a single human female in WoW. I do not PvP on her. She's a mage. Reason I picked human and a mage was because I liked the casting animation. On the odd chance I do PvP, it's on a draenei shaman or a blood elf paladin and both are healing so sitting in the back trying to avoid getting noticed. I don't use arcane torrent on my paladin as a result since I'm rarely in the fray. My shaman is the one I've PvPed on the most and shamans suck in PvP. Draenei also don't have a real PvP racial. So just because I have a human mage doesn't mean that's the one I PvP on. Try (or rather fail) harder.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest not to look much into humans having a higher percentage. Humans will ALWAYS be the most common race in any game with multiple races. It's just how many of us work. We go for what we can relate to. Not everyone can branch off and relate to a furry wolf or a cow or some alien from another world. And don't assume because you know one person who plays a race for a given reason that EVERYONE who plays that race plays it for the same reason. Don't assume. It only makes you look like an ass. Get the whole picture and not what YOU think is the reason. There's always more to the story than what there appears to be.</div></div><hr />

I always wondered on those people why they try to remake themselves in a fantasy game (human-like, same hair color etc.)... <br />
What is the point? Are your life so crap you want to remake in there? So pitty.<br />
I thought people play these games to try something new. Maybe I am different.</div></div><hr />

Because humans are always the &quot;default&quot; race for everyone I tend to avoid rolling them for that exact reason unless the game gives me no choice (like diablo 3 or dragon age 2). In Dragon Age Origins I made Elf Mage and in Inquisition Qunari Mage. In WoW the only 2 races I've never played were Humans and Taurens (sorry, I can play a panda bear or a dog but a cow is too much). But I think even people like me who like to play exotic races and not ordinary humans more often gravitate towards something that looks heroic, pretty or cool than something &quot;silly&quot;, &quot;joke race&quot;, that's why we see overall more Orcs, Elves and Draenei and less Gnomes, Goblins and Pandas. They have their fanbase but it's a niche. <br />

Remind me if it doesn't appear in the next few days. Would be very interesting. I'm pretty sure the usual tendencies will still show, but I'm curious how much right / wrong I am. For example I'm pretty sure if a class can be very few races it will be top pick among that race, for example there will be more Draenei Shamans, Blood Elf Paladins, Night Elf or Troll Druids than other classes within that race because for example Warriors or Rogues will be more spread between races. Also new class combos like Undead Hunter or Night Elf Mage will be behind old class combos for that class, for example behind Orc Hunters and Human Mages because if you had your character since vanilla you'll be reluctant to reroll or pay for racechange, unless there's a big reason to do so. <br />
<br />
I'm also very much curious what is the rarest class + race + gender combo! My bet would go to female dwarf mage or warlock, or female tauren priest or monk. But I'd like to see confirmation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that why it takes them so loooong to release new expansions for WoW, because they rush them? Are they pumping out D3 and SC expansions in an unfinished state every 12 months? Did they or did they not shut down development on Titan, a game they had already sunk tens of millions of dollars into?<br />
<br />
These don't sound like the actions of a company that purposefully rushes out shit to meet a deadline in order to satisfy a giggling Bobby Kotick.</div></div><hr />

It can't be that hard to fix. I just started playing SWTOR and the tab targeting in that game has never targeted the mob 50 yards behind me. <br />
<br />
And the targeting system in SWTOR also seems to recognize that you just encountered 3 mobs and targets the next mob in that group automatically...none of this encounter 3 mobs stuff, kill 2 and have to re-target the 3rd mob that is standing in front of you punching you in the face.<br />
<br />
If they can do it it intelligently in SWTOR surely they can do it in WoW.<br />
<br />
Tab targetting was broken in cata. Lots of people complained on the forums and they said it would require a client side patch, that they couldn't hotfix. A few months later the patch came and it was still broken. So people started posting threads on the forums again asking why it wasn't fixed and they kept deleting the threads. So I made a thread in MoP asking if they would finally fix tab targetting like they promised they would back in cata and it too was deleted. So don't expect them to fix this shit.</div></div><hr />
