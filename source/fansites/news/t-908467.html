<br />
Well, blizzard not balancing game around competent people but rather pretty average player who have little to nothing of knowledge on how to play their class properly.<br />
If DK, for example, doing a lot of damage without much effort and his target have no idea how to counter it, like run, slow, silence DK etc, blizzard will nerf DK since they have little hope for people to actually learn on how to play their class. And if PVE gets damaged in a process, oh well, who cares.</div></div><hr />

You have careful aim.<br />
http://www.simulationcraft.org/410/Raid_T11_372.html<br />
Yes, Hunters are ontop right now, but it's not that much of a leap. In 4.2 due to the way frost DKs scale, right now, They'll probably be ontop by a mile n a half, coupled with Arms warriors and Arcane mages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More to the point, why the hell are the messing with death knights so much? When was the last time you EVER (and this goes for everybody) seen a DK at the top of the dps meters?<br />
<br />
This is all about PvP, and why blizz has lost so many subs imo. <br />
<br />
They tinker and &quot;balance&quot; classes, but in pve classes have never been so unbalanced. 5K dps difference in the same ilvl gear from the same skilled player is not balance.</div></div><hr />

I tend to use Healing Surge way more in PvE (5 mans) than GHW. Never have any mana issues either. So yeah, it does get used in PvE. At least by me. Now I'm not a pro raid healer but I'm sure this is going to affect my healing in heroics. WTB 200% healing crits already to make up for this nerf in healing done.</div></div><hr />

I don't use it much in heroics myself. If someone is getting low on health, I simply use a Riptide+GHW combo and then move on to my next target because it is more efficient than spamming HS twice.</div></div><hr />

dont they play their game? dont they test their dps, tank,heals?<br />
i mean, just weeks ago, DK was buffed, weeks later they felt its too buffed, and nerfed it,<br />
<br />
u get where im driving at?<br />
its like when they buffed it, they didnt test it? why suddenly nerf it again? reason was: &quot; oh we realised the obliterate damage was too high&quot;<br />
then i reply you<br />
&quot;why is it too high/low? dont u freaking test the damage,heals etc after u buff/nerf it?&quot;<br />
<br />
i dont get why has skills got to be nerfed or buffed at all, it sshould be a fixed for every major patch,<br />
if u wanna buff a class (because new bosses are out thus need more dps or noob bosses out, need less dps etc)<br />
that i get it<br />
but every minor patches buff/nerf?</div></div><hr />

2nd, there isn't even 1 frost dk on the worldoflogs top 10 for any fight in cata, NOT 1. so why nerf dks. who the hell knows. i do pvp!<br />
<br />
do alot of howling blast spamming in a pve setup do ya? No wonder frost dks are not at the top<br />
<br />
as for the pvp nerf, yeah it was much needed<br />

<br />
My guess is that this is the misconception of someone that is somewhat new to raiding and most of his/her concerns come from not being as skilled or geared as the other players he raids with or...does a lot of 5mans and is judging off of the dps in 5mans where warlocks fall behind unless the fight last for any decent amount of time. Yes, I am a 366 geared warlock and frequent WOL ranker and I still get out bursted by 359 hunters/shamans and other classes from time to time in 5mans.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, warlocks are generally in the top 5 for almost all fights in 25m, sometimes even chart topping. If anything affliction is way ahead of most classes. <br />
Drain life itself doesn't tick very hard, that point may be true, but it does add an additional affliction spell to the target to allow your felhunter to hit much harder. However, as far as I'm aware, drainlife affliction is still the top specc even after the nerf and will probably use this until t12 4set. I agree that a pet critting for 75k is a bit crazy, especially when you already have dots rolling. So the nerf to drain life is probably to help ease the pvp pain some.</div></div><hr />

ding ding ding ding. Someone gets it!<br />
<br />
But in all honesty (concerning the rest of the nerfs), I'm waiting for the day that Blizzard just gives up and sets up two spell rulesets -- one for PvE and one for PvP. They're trying to make an E-Sport out of Arenas (and I guess rated BGs), not world PvP -- which is DEAD for the most part -- so the imbalances there shouldn't be an issue.<br />

<br />
This. The devs want you to make a decision on your filler. SB for more damage, or Drain for the healing. It had gotten to the point where Drain was always the choice. Blizzard likes it when current circumstances make you make hard choices, it is what separates the good players from the average players. When Drain is always the correct choice, it takes away that distinction.<br />
<br />
I think frost DKs are going to be in for some bumpy ups and downs over the next few months. That big change in 4.1 (no more blood runes) caused a pretty big change to gameplay, which means a lot of fine-tuning needs to be done to get things balanced again.</div></div><hr />

More to the point, why the hell are the messing with death knights so much? When was the last time you EVER (and this goes for everybody) seen a DK at the top of the dps meters?<br />
<br />
This is all about PvP, and why blizz has lost so many subs imo. <br />
<br />
They tinker and &quot;balance&quot; classes, but in pve classes have never been so unbalanced. 5K dps difference in the same ilvl gear from the same skilled player is not balance.<br />
<br />
I think it is hilarious when PVE players cry about PVP ruining the game. The developers have literally shifted all their efforts to PVE and they are losing so many subscriptions. Just look at the new Tier set bonuses and they are changing specs based on a gear bonus.... Really? PVE is killing this game because they are destroying everything else to appease idiots who care about how much damage they do to a boss.</div></div><hr />

If DK, for example, doing a lot of damage without much effort and his target have no idea how to counter it, like run, slow, silence DK etc, blizzard will nerf DK since they have little hope for people to actually learn on how to play their class. And if PVE gets damaged in a process, oh well, who cares.<br />

Anecdote inc : Hi i'm a dk, i'm immune to magic for 7 secs every 45, immune to stuns for 15? secs every 3 minutes, immune to fear for 10 secs every 2 minutes and immune to knockbacks for 12 secs every minute. I also have a 25 second cooldown death grip, the ability to root and slow any target at a range whilst also deploying descecration every necrotic strike. I also have a one minute cooldown aoe cc ability that synergises rediculously with death grip and goes through pillars. :) Have fun peeling me while I kill your healer!<br />

Yes, Hunters are ontop right now, but it's not that much of a leap. In 4.2 due to the way frost DKs scale, right now, They'll probably be ontop by a mile n a half, coupled with Arms warriors and Arcane mages.<br />
<br />
arms warriors are only so high because in the simulation results warriors had like 40 charges, meaning the charge bug is enabled, which is a 2-3k dps gain.</div></div><hr />

2nd, there isn't even 1 frost dk on the worldoflogs top 10 for any fight in cata, NOT 1. so why nerf dks. who the hell knows. i do pvp!<br />
<br />
How many DPS-Specs do we have?<br />
Rogue - 3<br />
Hunter - 3<br />
Mage - 3<br />
Warlock - 3<br />
Druid - 2<br />
Shaman - 2<br />
Warrior - 2<br />
Deathknight - 2<br />
Paladin - 1<br />
Priest - 1<br />
<br />
So we get 22 DPS-Specs, und thus more than 50% of all DPS-Specs will never be seen in the Top10 at any given Encounter. And then we get some Specs like Moonkin or Shadowpriest, which do a lot of damage by using DoTs, so first they can Multidot and second they are doing good damage even if they just walk around. They are ranged DPS, too, thus they will alway have some kind of advantage, because most encounter will prefer ranged DPS by their mechanic. And last but not least, many players ranked on WoL (dps and hps) are pushed to be ranked, so this ranking is some kind of meaningless.<br />
<br />
But yeah, nerfs are never a good thing no matter which class or spec is nerfed. As a PvE'er I don't fight against other players, I fight with them, so I'm not a fan of nerfs overall, better buff underpowered classes to be on par.</div></div><hr />

It's a better use of runes to use HB and NS than for Oblit until you fully setup killing blows on clothies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is a difference between feeling &quot;you must do top 3 dps&quot; and critising a nerf while you dont do top3 dmg. Because obviously if your dmg gets lowered it implies it was to high in the first place. But since DKs dont even come close to dominate the dmg parses , which means other classes do more dmg.... Its kind of a contradiction to see DKs nerfed, while those classes topping the meters stay unchanged. What I mean is it is against any logic to nerf any specc, as long as the speccs dealing more dmg stay unchanged.<br />
<br />
And its even more frustrating to see this HOTFIXED in. They tested this not even 1 week on the PTR ( HB change was just a few days ago) , it will nerf PVE dmg where we were at a reasonable level and will leave PVP mostly untouched.... You can already predict that in 2-3 months they will suddenly regain some brain and notice that they overdid it again. Look at Unholy... The whole hotfix nerf which came about 12 hours after 4.0.6 will be undone.... Well cool, but have they learnt? NO.....They just throw out another pretty much untested Hotfix nerf.... Whole cata for DK DDs was a rollercoaster, up and down...but on average the pattern is always down.<br />
<br />
http://stateofdps.com/<br />
<br />
Honestly.....Does that look like we need to be nerfed??? And btw look at Unholy to see how intelligent blizz applies hotfixes....<br />
<br />
And as far as I know there is also a 5% Strength buff to Unholy on the PTR... Seems like a very minor buff to a totally ruined dps specc needs more testing.... oh the irony....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind that Live vs PTR mean nothing.<br />
<br />
Basically, this nerf shows up after its been used for over 5 months and in the form of a hotfix. Of the 3 DK changes, really only the HB was changed in 4.1 and even that was changed in two ways to be about the same as pre 4.1 overall. <br />
The net result of this change leaves the area-of-effect damage roughly the same as 4.0.6 numbers.<br />
<br />
This is simply a fail on Blizzards behalf. Regardless of whatever the changes may be, the abilities have been being used since launch, I do not see any reason it would have taken over 5 months for someone to see that a change was needed. They already admitted that there is not enough of a basis to actually listen to what the players say when it comes to PvE content on the PTR and this just proves that they do not do any form of testing when it comes to PvP as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DK's: Because 9-10k Howling Blast hits, non-crit, on 3.6k+ resil targets is quite ridiculous.. considering you can spam it twice in a row and is a ranged attack; enough said. <br />
Healing Surge: Enh Shamans Healing Surge heals more than a Boomkin's Regrowth; Enh Shammies don't use intellect.<br />

And item lvl dk with 344. Can easily do 19-22k dps. &quot;with 5-14%&quot; buff from ZG/ZA..<br />
<br />
I play dk aswell, Somehow they have to change it so we scale with AP. And not the weps &quot;dps&quot; Since that seems to be the deal here. As obi takes the dps from the wep. and plus some % of ap. Perhaps, edit it to scale abit more with ilvl gear of higher geared folks. I perhaps have no clue what im talking about. But who cares?<br />
<br />
Anyway, do something about the scaling. I play dk aswel, so yeah im reasonable.<br />
Dk isn't my main, do yeah whatever!<br />

How many times has it been the other way around. It has been said a lot lately, this unbalance will continue until Blizzard separates the way an ability performs in pve and pvp.

But really, somehow this works for them (blizzard). As some a stupid enough to reroll classes if they get nerfed enough. <br />
<br />
I got a lvl 85 dk, and i barely play it. But really they are insane atm in burst dmg etc. But simply just just scale to highly for there current ilvl.<br />
Nerf that somehow. thats the factor they should be nerfing imo.<br />
<br />
And to the reroll stuff, I simply rerolled Priest and i can easily see why nerf paladins &quot;holy&quot; all the times, Since they are simply faceroll, (and im a endgame raider, 3-4 buttoms really?) and got way to much mana regen. Perhaps they aren't top anymore on the healing meter as we are allowed to slack compared to before. As we don't carry the raid anymore healing wise.<br />
<br />
So overall, stop whining. there is no point in it. Bliizzard had made some calculations before evening consitter this. This is just a way to set things abit straight.<br />
And might be the wrong place add the nerfment. Since they got classes that's way about frost dk's still. <br />
<br />
*cough* Hunters; surv &amp; MM, Warr and arcane. specially hunters and warriores.<br />
<br />
And now, start set some changes to pvp, when it comes to nerfing. As you did to CC during pvp last only sec. <br />
Simply, nerf frost dks &amp; warriors in pvp, aka, there burst dmg, or the selfhealing as you did for paladins.<br />
<br />
As i simply stopped playing retri pvp, during to the nerf GoW. Simply handling of warriors dps on pvp is 3-5% dps nerf in pvp. just do it man.<br />
<br />
all for now.<br />

<br />
No, it hasn't been going on for years.<br />
<br />
Tweaks, nerfs in general? Yes.<br />
20-30% changes to multiple abilities for several classes every patch, and now even in hotfixes? No, that's brand spanking new.<br />
<br />
Players had to swallow very bitter homogenization of classes/roles with Cata, with the primary upside being that balancing would be easier. But balancing has been horrific, so it's a double whammy.<br />
<br />
And people have been taking your advice (to gtfo). That line was all well and good when WoW was growing, but now that it's on the decline, it's the last thing any fan of the game should be saying to anyone. Half-abandoned servers will outright ruin your gameplay (just ask the folks already playing on dead realms).</div></div><hr />

Yes, Hunters are ontop right now, but it's not that much of a leap. In 4.2 due to the way frost DKs scale, right now, They'll probably be ontop by a mile n a half, coupled with Arms warriors and Arcane mages.<br />
Could you go into detail on this one? This is not some sort of stupid offence, I just would like you to specify your statement, since the current Tier alre dy showed how Frost scales (through changes, not through the gear). I play DK myself, the nerf doesn't hit me that hard, since it's only a slight decrease of DPS overall. What I don't get is why Blizz deals with the PvP/PvE balance almost properly (for instance Fury Warrs who have a &quot;on players it does only XX% ignore&quot; policy) and for some classes, my own one, completely ignore that opportunity.<br />

Pretty sure PvP is already in WCG btw, which makes it an e-sport by definition. What's the skill involved in killing some boss casting the same spells in the same order on the same person for 20 fucking mintues to get some piece of gear with slightly higher numbers on it so that ur numbers will come out bigger the next time u do the same fucking raid again and again so then you can brag to everyone about how big your numbers are and then sit around alone at night (assuming ur alone cause ur a sad raiding nerd) and jizz over your massive numbers. You're pathetic.<br />
<br />
On my original point. I wouldnt call 20% healing surge reduction a minor nerfbat, 20% on a primary spell is pretty massive lol.</div></div><hr />

You don't PvP much, do you?<br />
<br />
Step 1. Be a resto shaman with a reasonable amount of resilience.<br />
Step 2. Walk into arena.<br />
Step 3. Live forever.<br />
<br />
I know it sounds like an exaggeration, but really, I... I don't know how else to explain it. Where the other three healers have their weaknesses, it feels like shaman doesn't have one. They have good cc, one of the best interrupts available, snare reduction that also boosts speed, instant heals, hots, a heal outside their primary school, three available schools and two with cast bars for baiting interrupts, plenty of modifiers to make for big heals (Shaman's the only one I've seen bring someone from sub-10% to full in two GCDs, outside of lay on hands), absorbs, slows, a wide range of buffs and debuffs, high armor, a self-damage cc breaker (on a long cooldown, in all fairness), the best mana regen cooldown, the ability to still act while silenced (totems), probably the highest or second highest healer dps for when extra pressure's needed, a potential spell reflect (though most just go for the deflect, which is worth noting in and of itself)... am I missing anything? I feel like I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

You're wrong. Shaman have a weakness. They are EASILY killable... IF they dont have any partners in 3v3.<br />
Other then that you're right ;D More nerfs please!</div></div><hr />

<br />
frost is over 2000 (!) dps away from fire mages, mm hunter, shadow priests and boomkin druids (4 classes of which only 1 -namely shadows- receives dps relevant nerfs)<br />
it isnt even the best melee dps yet they nerf the main pve ability which is only sitautionally used in pvp (obliterate) to bring it in line for lol-arena-lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
but hey, no need to be upset:<br />
my hunter alt is already 71 and should be 85 and waiting with 4000 points till the day 4.2 hits... gearing him up to the item level my &quot;main&quot; is now is probably a matter of 1 week in 4.2 and blizzard really cant be bothered with the irrelevant fact that i LIKE playing my dk<br />

<br />
All it does is derive its data from the top 200 or so parses in WoL, and thus is in no shape way or form reliable information.<br />
And yes, I know I'm not the 1st to state it, and most likely not the last.<br />
<br />
Just noticed, it is even using 4.0.6 data and not 4.1.</div></div><hr />

But considering the healing model in this expansion, Necrotic Strike should steal a<br />
small amount of healing. It should not become a de-facto 75% MS by absorbing 50K worth of healing, which is where it was headed too. <br />
Ideally NS should have a short cooldown and only absorb something like 5K healing. With the debuff being shorter than the cooldown. <br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Surge seems like a huge nerf, and perhaps unnecessary. As a Holy Pally, they nerfed Holy Pally for Cataclysm and everywhere they nerfed<br />
they buffed shaman. So it seems to be a &quot;lets gut class A to make class B more attractive to make up for how much we fucked up class B&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />

we all get our time of nerf or OP fun, life goes on.<br />
<br />
1st off I wasn't talking about trash mobs in HC's, but near every boss I do in HC dungeons I am on top of dps, even after the 3rd or 4th nerf now. but thats my casual experiance, in which I am not a full time raider.<br />
2nd'ly I feel bad for Sub Rogue's (Looking at that DPS State..<br />
Oh and 3rd'ly - Stop the QQ yo full of it lol you not makin sense bra'</div></div><hr />
