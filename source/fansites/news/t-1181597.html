<br />
Currency Conversion Before and After Mists of Pandaria<br />
The currency conversion coming with Mists of Pandaria is going to happen in three stages, and this is how we plan for it to progress:<br />
<br />
With Patch 5.0.4 on August 28<br />
<br />
Valor points will be converted to Justice points, and Conquest points will be converted to Honor points.<br />
<br />
Neither of the resultant currencies (Justice and Honor) will have an enforced hard-cap at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
The current Arena season will end.<br />
Players will no longer be able to earn Valor or Conquest points (bosses will drop Justice, Arenas will be closed).<br />
Items formerly purchasable for Valor/Conquest will be available for Justice/Honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
With Mists of Pandaria on September 25<br />
<br />
Valor can be earned again.<br />
<br />
Characters can earn up to 1000 Valor per week, and carry a maximum of 3000 Valor.<br />
Daily quests, random Scenarios, random Heroic dungeons, and all levels of raiding will reward Valor.<br />
Valor will be used to purchase ilvl 489 gear in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
The Klaxxi (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1337-the-klaxxi), Golden Lotus (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1269-golden-lotus), Shado-Pan (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1270-shado-pan), and August Celestials (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1341-the-august-celestials) factions will sell this gear.<br />
Revered reputation with each faction will be required.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conquest will become earnable.<br />
<br />
There is a cap of 4000 Conquest points.<br />
Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds reward Conquest.<br />
It will be used to purchase ilvl 483 gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Malevolent+Gladiator%27s) from Pandaren battlemasters (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/65165-doris-chiltonius) on the Great Wall.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With Mists of Pandaria, Patch 5.1<br />
<br />
We currently plan to upgrade the Valor system as Ghostcrawler described in Mists of Pandaria Looting Explained (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219630-dev-watercooler-mists-of-pandaria-looting-explained/) in the 5.1 patch, allowing you to upgrade your gear using Valor points. Weâ€™ll have additional information once Mists of Pandaria launches and we get closer to the 5.1 patch release.<br />
<br />

Raid DPS Test Dummies<br />
We're aware of the issue with pets getting debuffed by the dummies and have a fix coming for that. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/232482-raid-dps-test-dummies/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6307802424?page=13#260))<br />

LFR Feedback<br />
never understood what's so bad about wanting to be a special snowflake, btw. If some people get sense of joy from that, why not let them.<br />
There's nothing bad about it. The issue comes when demands are made to artificially create an environment that lets someone be identified as a &quot;snowflake&quot;. If someone wants to be a snowflake, you'll have to go the extra mile, prove your worth, do what others don't... but not sit in a corner asking to please prevent others from getting what you did long ago.<br />
<br />
The issue with these kind of discussions is that at some point, they end up being driven by hyperbole and harassment. <br />
<br />
If all your arguments (in either direction) revolve around discrediting others through personal attacks rather than their arguments, then it's probably time to lock the thread.<br />
<br />
However, my main concern with both LFR and LFD is the removal of the player from the world environment. Whilst I do believe LFD is a great tool for servers with a low population (I used to be on Dragonmaw which has a very low population and finding a group for just a 5 man could have taken hours), finding groups for dungeons and raids and then travelling to the instance felt like an important part of the game and kept the virtual idea of a world. The removal of this feature, and the lack of motivation and incentive to form groups with people on your own server has damaged realm society in my opinion.<br />
Mists of Pandaria comes with plenty of level 90 content. All the daily quests available throughout Pandaria (remember, there's no daily cap in Mists), Pet battles, Challenge Dungeons (which can't be accessed through the Dungeon Finder and require groups to be manually formed), and the two new world bosses in Valley of the Four Winds and Kun-Lai Summit will hopefully provide plenty of reason to go outside the faction cities.<br />
<br />
We'll wait and see I guess, since whatever concern we try to explain gets countered with the sheer overwhelming blinding light at the end of the tunnel called MoP. Overly sarcastic? Yes, perhaps, simply because currently you're bringing arguments to the table we cannot refute due to the content not being out.<br />
I know the only thing you can do on this regard is &quot;wait and see&quot;. I'm not saying &quot;MoP will fix it and there'll be rainbows and unicorns&quot;, but I do believe that if you take into account all the features and new raiding content coming up at level 90, things will look very different to most players compared to these days.

<br />
Yeah, there really will be no reason to stockpile JP. I think you will be able to buy 8 pieces of gear (depending on your spec) and it will be spread across 4 factions. JP gear only requires Honored, which you will get from questing through the appropriate zones. But the big thing is that the JP gear you can buy from the faction vendors is a tier below what drops in heroic dungeons. It isnÂ´t like previous expansion where JP gear was equal to heroic gear.<br />
<br />
But I kinda messed up. I have already started preparing for the 4000 JP cap by transfering my JP into Honor. Now we know there isnÂ´t a cap, I will lose some more for transfering. I was basing it on the PTR, where there was a 4000 JP cap and you got gold for anything over 4k.</div></div><hr />

Daily quests, random Scenarios, random Heroic dungeons, and all levels of raiding will reward Valor.<br />

This implies that you'll get Valor points not just from daily Heroic dungeons, but from all of them (regardless of how many you do). And also from Scenarios, it seems. This brings up two questions;<br />

I believe justice points are awarded for normal instances in MOP. The idea is that you can get JP to buy rares from the venders in order to prepare for Heroic MOP instances that will give you VP.</div></div><hr />

Once you get to revered which shouldn't take that long you won't have to do those dailies anymore unless you want the mounts. Then once you have gotten to revered you can grind H dungeons / scenarios and challenge modes for VP's.</div></div><hr />

I've played around with PvP on the Beta, and if they're wearing PvE gear and you're wearing PvP, they won't even scratch you. PvP Power is necessary to lower your resil which with PvP Defense gets a little insane. I think my SPriest has around 80% Reduced Damage from Players from Resil alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) On 8/28 (Patch Day), VP and CP get converted to JP and HP respectively. No cap to JP and HP. VP and CP gear purchasable with JP and HP. Elite CP Gear removed.<br />
2) On 9/25 (XPac Day), Hard Cap of JP and HP of 4k is put back. Points over 4k are converted to gold. Points under 4k are kept.<br />
<br />
JP gear is pretty weak in the first tier (iirc, lower ilvl than heroic dungeon drops). VP gear is also nothing to write home about (iirc, lower ilvl than LFR drops). They're there mostly to fill in gaps where you've had bad luck with drops.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but doesn't it take a minimum of 2-3 weeks to get enough VP for just ONE piece of valor gear?<br />
<br />
I've said this before, but I don't think people realize that VP vendors aren't supposed to be a primary way to gear up anymore. They're more like the BC badge vendors, ways to supplement your dungeon/raid drops if you're not very lucky.<br />
<br />
Trying to put together a full set of VP gear from VP vendors isn't going to be very viable, since it would take several months to earn the VP, nevermind the reputation grinding.</div></div><hr />

If u read a little closer you will see that when the conversion occurs there will temporarily be no cap on VP</div></div><hr />

right, vp never had a cap. just trying to find out if there will still be a jp cap. converting all that vp to jp i figure the leftover would be mailed to me. i shouldn't lose any of it. i need it for boa gear.<br />
<br />
edit: oops nevermind. just had to read it again. guess it will all goto currency and nothing mailed out since no leftovers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
JP gear is pretty weak in the first tier (iirc, lower ilvl than heroic dungeon drops). <br />
<br />
It's worse than that, JP gear is weaker than honor gear.<br />
<br />
Take a look at, for example:<br />
<br />
http://mop.wowhead.com/compare?items=89524;84371<br />
<br />
Honor gear is 14 ilvl higher than JP gear AND now has no budget penalty for what it spends on Resilience. If things stay this way I'll be grinding honor to gear up for LFR instead of heroics.<br />
<br />
VP gear beats Conquest gear (mostly through being 6 ilvl HIGHER) so JP gear appears to be about 14-20 ilvl too low to be worth it. Heroic dungeons (which I presume we're going to grind to get the JP in the first place) drop ilvl 463 gear, which beats the JP gear. Add to that the fact that many JP items require reputation (which could take weeks of dailies to reach) and suddenly it seems the ONLY use for JP will be if you run heroics for several weeks and never get something better than your questing greens to drop for a slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can understand the difference. Shoulder enchants are more necessary irregardless of of what tier or Ilvl gear you are applying it to. Valor gear is &quot;optional&quot;. The shoulder enchants are not really optional.</div></div><hr />
