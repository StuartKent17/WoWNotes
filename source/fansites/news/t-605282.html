The global cooldown on casting totems has been reduced. It is now 1 second instead of 1.5<br />
Flametongue Weapon now reduces the effectiveness of healing spells on your target by 50%. Lasts 5 seconds and refresh every hits. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/flametonguedebuff.jpg))<br />
Toughness now Increases your armor value from items by 2/4/6/8/10% and reduces the duration of movement impairing effects on you by -10/20/30/40/50%.<br />
Shamanistic rage now let you regenerate mana equal to 30% of your attack power instead of 15. Duration reduced to 15 seconds. (Was 30 seconds)<br />

+119 healing, (or +40dmg..)<br />
<br />
Also nice they add epic versions of the haste rating gems, but I dont really see the point of that 12 def rating enchant. I am pretty sure every tank would prefer 12 dodge/12agi over 12 def? Seeing the mats I am sure the really cheapass ones will even prefer 120 armor.<br />
<br />
As for the Lifetap change, 20% to 20% so with talents this will become 20% to 24%?<br />
But I am glad they added some lower ranks aswel. Now lets hope they dont change too much drastic stuff about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The enhance buffs are nice and sensible, faster GW and toughness reducing movement impairing affects will help their mobility which they needed.<br />

I think next they will add to resilience what they did to mana burns, <br />
<br />
Reduce the effectiveness of healing debuffs by XX for some resilience, <br />

and there goes the buff for shamans :-\<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, every other melee class has one, we have no antiheal utility or plate bursting. I think it's fair.<br />
<br />
but shamans aren't a melee class, hunters, warriors and rogues can't heal themselves or other players, handing out mortal strike debuffs for everyone seems like an easy way to fix things for blizzard but it's not the buff shamans really need and it's not limited to enhancement spec shamans either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly, if they do have to give ms to every class, they should all have goofy versions like shaman and rogues get<br />
they have to SACRIFICE DAMAGE in order to use it, rogues would rather be using slow or damage poisons, shamans would rather be windfurying<br />
<br />
there is no need for more arcane shot treatment where they buff a move that was already CONSTANTLY used<br />
<br />
my opinion anyway.<br />
also 90% chance it will be on elemental weapons talent next update.</div></div><hr />

Spell reflect and intercept are nice but so are frostshock and earthshock. You cant even pull the &quot;endless rage&quot; thing, with water shield they have near infinite mana, if they dont need it to heal themselves.<br />
And its not like heroism isnt a big factor in arenas.<br />
<br />
I still believe shamans deserve some buffs .... but this is too much at once. I suggest to every shamans to go try thoses changes on the PTR, because i cant believe they will come intact to the live servers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creedalba</div><div class="date">2008-02-28, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've not read all of the comments here yet but personally I think the Shammy healing debuff is rediculous.<br />
<br />
I know that Shammies are way under represented in arena but this helps Resto/Ele shammies in no way. This will make enhance shammies a huge pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
Lasts 5 seconds and is applied on every melee attack? That is going to mean that their target will have a healing debuff on them 90% of the fight unless you are able to Kite the Shammy. The only way I could see this being viable is if it is a dispellable debuff. It doesn't say anywhere that it is a Mortal Strike so if it is perhaps a magic effect that can be removed I won't complain. It will still be a huge buff to enhance shammies.<br />
<br />
The spell pushback/purge from an enhance shammy already makes them a huge problem for most healers. I would hope this gets changed somehow to a new shock that needs to be reapplied to the target constantly during the fight with the normal Shock CD that way it buffs all 3 specs evenly and cannot be on the target for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents:)<br />

<br />
<br />
If you consider negative scaling to be &quot;truly scaling&quot;, sure. Warlocks itemize for stamina, and that means that Life Tap effectively gets more expensive the better gear you get.<br />
<br />
In fact, most warlock gear has more stamina than int on it, thus Life Tap actually most likely will return a worse HP-&gt;MP conversion the better one's gear gets (not to mention PvP gear, which has little to no int).<br />
<br />
All in all, it's a really stupid way to change Life Tap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Windfury proc vs. Constant 50% healing debuff? Doesn't sound like much of a sacrifice to me.<br />
<br />
Also, my main point was that this will not help Ele/Resto in arena.<br />
<br />
Most Enhance Shammies in arena right now for 3v3 and 5v5 run with an Arms warrior. The Arms Warrior MS + Enh Shammy Windfury/Heroism are what make the team viable. Huge burst right there that normally wipes out 1dps immediately unless going against a double healer team. This wont be affected by the healing debuff because Windfury is a huge bonus for the Arms warrior and the Arms warrior has MS up on the target being nuked. With this I can see your point that Windfury cannot be replaced.<br />
<br />
For 2v2 I don't see any comparison though. Enh Shammy+Healer team would benefit a great dead from the Enh Shammies constant healing debuff.<br />
<br />
For Resto and Ele Shammies, they will remain under represented. Only to be taken into 5v5 as a support class. Rarely used in 2v2 or 3v3 because its all about the burst:(</div></div><hr />

well it says 50% reduce to flametounge weapon and well the totem is called flametounge &quot;totem&quot; :) so the answer to your question is no. and if you think about it u shouldnt even be needing to ask this :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As I said before, kiting is an option.<br />
<br />
For 2v2 though, what if you run Enh Shammy/Resto Druid and run into MS War/Resto Druid? Neither dps will be able to catch a decent Resto Druid so its MS War vs Enh Shammy with healing debuffs burning druid mana. A constant 50% healing debuff will drain the war/druid mana a heck of a lot faster than MS will. Or how about Rogue/Druid? Rogue poison will just be removed the majority of the fight leaving only the shammy debuff up.<br />
<br />
Giving the shammy a 50% healing debuff that is reapplied constantly and cannot be removed will put them miles ahead of the other 2v2 dps classes.</div></div><hr />

Since when have I ever seen a shaman drop a flametongue totem? :P<br />
And while I know what the top post says, there isn't anything I can find about it on the official forums, and the tooltip in the SS, while yes I understand that there is a shaman in the SS, doesn't seem to differentiate between either the totem proc or the weapon imbue proc.<br />
So yes, I do feel there's a need to ask.<br />

sure it will be a huge dps mali, if you still uses a 2.6 weapon speed weapon!<br />
but if you invest the talent points in mental quickness, using a speedy weapon and put flametounge on it...<br />
there would be nearly no dps drop!<br />
only later on, with a huge amount of armor pen, flametounge is scaling to bad, but your dps is still enoug, and the healing reduce buff is very nice!<br />
for all the QQing....<br />
have you ever finghting melee+ heal VS melee + heal + MS?<br />
the best parner for an melee schamy is an disc priest, disc priest aren´t made for healing, they are made for dispelling and heal a little bit!<br />
so it´s a normal team setting, enhancment + disc VS warri + druid... <br />
HOW should a discpriest heal against an MS warri? for sure, the shield.. lol<br />
the druid is running in circels, far away from the schamy, hotting and running...<br />
of course it´s possible to get him.... but till then the mana of the disc priest is somewhere below zero...<br />
<br />
and in 3on3, new team settings are awailable, retri pala /fury warrior + enh. schamy + disc priest/dudu/pala<br />
of course these changes are huge, I think the MS effekt will be to heavy, but we will se... OP are other classes, maybe the enh. schamy is closing up! =)<br />
<br />
and to ele schamys: every class has ONE tree for pvp, one tree for being able to make pvp, and one tree which has NOTHING to do with pvp<br />
<br />
enhancment &gt; heal &gt; ele i would say for future, but we will see ;)</div></div><hr />

Warlocks itemize for stamina, and that means that Life Tap effectively gets more expensive the better gear you get.<br />
<br />
In fact, most warlock gear has more stamina than int on it, thus Life Tap actually most likely will return a worse HP-&gt;MP conversion the better one's gear gets (not to mention PvP gear, which has little to no int).<br />
<br />
All in all, it's a really stupid way to change Life Tap.<br />
<br />
<br />
The more &quot;safe&quot; (i.e. more stamina) the equipment is, the less efficient it becomes. The same goes for every other caster in the game (e.g. priests and mages) for high party damage encounters. They need to gimp their healing/damage to survive the fights.<br />
<br />
Stamina has a double utility for warlocks - which is a great thing. Blizzard may have thought it was becoming too much of a great thing.<br />
<br />
But be happy - they could have changed LT in order to follow the STA budget cost at TBC launch =&gt; 2 HP = 1 MP...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
its a PVP nerf that yet again affect PVE <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems (to me) that is also (or mostly) a PVE change and Blizzard wants to avoid locks only to have a modicum of intelligence and then STA all the way.</div></div><hr />

OK first off ppl its NOT the flametongue totem that will get MS effect. its the flametongue weapon enchant, witch only the shaman can get. So stop dreaming.<br />

And btw w8 and see. I got a 70 enhc shamy, and even i think this buff will be to mutch. I dont think we need a buff like this. And sacrifice an offhand Windfury is not that big drop of dmg. Still got WF on MH. Flametongue weapon enchant also deal some fire dmg on eatch attack.</div></div><hr />

Correction, rogues have a 30% chance to apply a 10% healing debuff on every swing.. so for 50% on average you need 15 attacks to apply. coming from 1 blade that tends to take time.. alot of time. Sure you can shiv it for 100% application but then any poison cleanse might remove your crippling which also only has 30% chance to apply per hit making it hard to stay on your target.<br />
But indeed, give rogues 75% or so chance to apply woundpoison please, it would still take us ~7 hits to stack it fully.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You may think that but as the ONLY class whose healingdebuff is removable, by ALL healers except the priest no less. Which also has the lowest chance to 'proc' and on top of it all we need to give up heroism and other weaponenchants (we need wound and crippling poison as a minimum).<br />
Then we get penalized again for cripling which we need to again use as a weaponenchant. Slows the most, duration 12s but renewable, with 30% procchance. And all these poisons cost us time and gold to make btw.<br />
I think a rogues poisons are the worst of all the healing debuffs.<br />
<br />
Wariors get it for free on a serious damaging ability they can spam every 6s.. even if no healign is involved they will be spammign that MS button whenever they can so basicly they get it at no cost at all. <br />
And offcourse hamstring, only 50% but longer duration, non-dispellable with peanut damage on top. Ohh. and talented for a 15% chance at 5s freeze.. pretty imba too.<br />
<br />
Hunters have a 2.5s cast which is pretty much the only downside to it as it also comes on top off already nice damage.<br />
Slowing methods.. to numourous to mention.. one of the classes key features realy.<br />
<br />
Now shamans get it undispellable with 100% chance to apply while only giving up minimal dps since the weaponenchant it procs off also adds damage and their frostshock comes free from weaponenchants.<br />
Snares with frostshock, moderate damage, useable from 20yrds but dispellable.<br />
<br />
Offcourse I'm a rogue so biased in my oppinion but I can't see how anyone would say rogues get the better deal with healign and speeddebuffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and its not for FREE, if it wasn't 31 pts arms talents pvp warriors would be fury, blizzard at least put imp intercept in arms tree, although at the cost of weapon mastery. crip poison is op, that is not a poison i would complain about. <br />
<br />
correct imp hamstring is talented at 15%, next patch it has an internal cooldown AND comes at the expense of damage talents. shamans is 100% chance correct, but it can be resisted, although that is not too frequent. it is also 5 seconds instead of 10 or 12.<br />
<br />
granted at first look this is pretty op, and may still be changed before 2.4 goes live, but its going to give enhancement shamans the viability in arenas they have never had, without negatively impacting the other class too much. <br />
<br />
btw the grass is always greener on the other side, i would love to have crip and wound psns any day of the week. also, could you imagine rogue + enhance sham as dps in a 3v3, purge and the use of crip + mind numbing, GG rofl'ing a healer with pushback plus earthshock plus kick and all that damage while applying the MS debuff.</div></div><hr />

shamans are still kind of gimped, even with the buff, they still have to be able to hit for it to work, getting kited there goes the buff, getting stun locked oops there it goes again, frost nova'd, ham stringed, cripplin poisoned, i doubt all those slows and lock downs can all be removed fast enough in 5 seconds to re apply that FT buff. and in arena when enhance shamans get bursted down like crazy, gota put a shield on alot. and with a shield on if u wanna keep FT on you lose mass dps, or if u wanna keep some dps u gota keep WF on. so its not totally over powered it just helps a bit<br />
<br />
Warriors have tons more armory, can intercept and charge, and stick on a target better than a shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that they both have an ms affect, warriors still are harder to kill, harder to kite, and are better for arena<br />
<br />
Rouge poisons are just like a bonus, giving them that ms affect was huge anyways<br />
they are like impposible to kite, got like a million cds they can pop, then prep, then repop. o wow wound poison mite be a little hard to put up but they got all that other crap going for them<br />
<br />
Hunters can just kite around, and have ranged ms, id rather be able to cast a MS effect from 35 yards away then having to be 5 yards away</div></div><hr />

No I'm not kidding you.. the rogue is whining about loosing abilities that were once uniquely shared by wars and rogues, now there's already 4 classes. That shamans need buffs fine, but give them their unique buffs.. not ours!<br />
Btw, you keep nagging about enhance shams needing buffs.. you realise this ais a buff to ALL shams?!<br />
<br />
And enough time to apply during stunlock? ? You realise both druid and shaman poison cleanse works over time right? And add a certain trinket...<br />
<br />
And seriously shabuegah, you say yourself it's not what they need.. so WTF should shamans get a healigndebuff?<br />
<br />
And Azain, a rogue with shaman.. you won't be seeing mindnumbing from the rogue I'll bet.. windfury would do more. Besides, shaman buffs make our 12s into 6s. Shamans also pop a poison cleansing totem when fighting rogues.. Not so overpowered now is it?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not complaining about rogues as a total.. but our woundpoisons (and crippling) already comes at the biggest cost of them all. Needed? Who knows. But giving it to every damn class that needs buffs.. no please!</div></div><hr />

just like they make hs 5s, you don't see me starting a QQ fest about having to spam hamstring more than i do. shaman psn cleansing totem was once every 5 seconds, until this patch it was worthless, 2.4 will be different if changes stay the same. <br />
<br />
if your locking down a shaman 1v1 i don't know that he will even have time to drop the totem at the risk of not healing himself, and its not like a gouge -&gt; auto attack totem is out of the question. <br />
<br />
while i agree this may not be the best route for enhancement shamans, because it opens the case for retadins and feral druids to get the same effect, i don't think it will be as game-breaking as everyone's reactions to it. <br />
<br />
personally as a warrior i'm still looking for the equivalent of fleet-footed talents that rogues/hunters get, or even something on par with toughness that shamans get now.</div></div><hr />

If you let a hunter kite you around, THEN get an Aimed Shot off on you, just quit right now. With a three second cast time, you should be able to close the distance or LOS before he hits you.</div></div><hr />

That shamans need buffs fine, but give them their unique buffs.. not ours!<br />
Btw, you keep nagging about enhance shams needing buffs.. you realise this ais a buff to ALL shams?!<br />
<br />
And enough time to apply during stunlock? ? You realise both druid and shaman poison cleanse works over time right? And add a certain trinket...<br />
<br />
And seriously shabuegah, you say yourself it's not what they need.. so WTF should shamans get a healigndebuff?<br />
<br />
And Azain, a rogue with shaman.. you won't be seeing mindnumbing from the rogue I'll bet.. windfury would do more. Besides, shaman buffs make our 12s into 6s. Shamans also pop a poison cleansing totem when fighting rogues.. Not so overpowered now is it?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not complaining about rogues as a total.. but our woundpoisons (and crippling) already comes at the biggest cost of them all. Needed? Who knows. But giving it to every damn class that needs buffs.. no please!<br />
<br />
<br />
dude its neither about making a class unique nor does any class lose something. (you dont lose your ms debuff ...)<br />
<br />
its about making a class competitive in the arena. and a melee-class without an ms debuff is not competitive in the arena at all. It would be obvious to replace him with a melee class WITH ms debuff.<br />
<br />
Personally i think there are already too much healing debuffs in the game, as there is too much crowd control. And i dont think it is the right way to make the enhancer competitive at all. (imo he still sucks even with ms debuff)<br />
But as you might know from the Kalgan interview about shamans, they want to make enhancement viable for 2v2 and well there you need the healing-debuff to compete.<br />
<br />
About the poisons, the abilities to remove them are ridicilous at best. The totem is a joke plus poison cleanse is a waste of global CD, especially if you try to remove talented poisons ...<br />
<br />
<br />
the stupid thing is that the healing debuff comes with Flametongue and not with Stormstrike, that does not make sense at all.<br />
<br />
but probably one of Kalgans buddies started playing enhancer ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And everytime some other class gets something relativly unique to a rogue a rogue looses some of the reasons you bring him along in the first place. See where I'm comign from? No problem buffign enhance shams, but please, don't dilute what makes rogues &quot;attractive&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2008-02-28, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lifetap change is stupid. So now my lvl 1 warlock with her 100 mana pool needs to life tap 5 times in a row to cast a single rank 1 shadowbolt.<br />
<br />
They are going around the life tap change all backwards if you ask me. They should just change the health cost to a fixed percentage, 15%, 20% whatever and leave the mana returned a fixed value that scales with rank. <br />
<br />
E.g.<br />
<br />
Life Tap rank 7: Convert 20% of your health into 580 mana.<br />
<br />
Lastly the fixed percent of both they are implementing if they stay at 20% is actually a buff for PvE warlocks since getting healed generally isn't an issue, at that level the cheapest crappiest heals can pretty much restore 20% of your PvE health anyway so you will just reduce the overheal and more importantly it would mean that lifetap returned much more mana per tap.<br />
<br />
With a raid buffed 12k health and 10k mana you get 2000 mana for 2400 health compared to the ~1800 mana for ~1800 health you were getting with 1550 spell damage (a bit higher than you would have at that level) meaning you spend about 10% less time life tapping which translates into more damage done.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the Flametongue change, it certainly sounds interesting though it would probably make more sense if it was a deep enhancement talented ability as opposed to an across the board shaman ability. As a warrior it is dissapointing to see what is basically a warriors main ability in PvP being handed off to yet another class and considering anytime giving MS effect to Bloodthirst or Shield Slam is mentioned to give non-arms warriors PvP viability is mentioned we basically get the &quot;we want to keep each talent spec unique&quot; line it starts to ring hollow when the same unique ability is being passed around to other classes.<br />
<br />
I think it would make more sense for Blizzard to just sit back and look at how the way healing and resillience are scaling in PvP has created a situation where it is pretty much impossible to out DPS a healer without some sort of healing debuff. I would say it would have been much more interesting if resillience actually increased damage taken by 1% for every 1% reduced crit chance gained because the current simple damage reduction just makes healing scale exponentially with gear in arena as healing done scales at the same time as damage taken goes down. This was obvious at the start where dots were scaling better and blizz fixed it the wrong way, they nerfed the dots whereas they should have instead increased the sustained damage output by non-dot abilities.</div></div><hr />

I'm not upset w/ the Changes at all. In 5s it's great for me. Shammy can trop flametongue to keep the heals mitigated until the enemy's healers are dead then switch to Windfury so I can lay some extra hards hits on whatever's left. Only poison I'll be needing is Crippling, which I can Shiv on. The flexibility is quite welcome, imo.</div></div><hr />

+119 healing, (or +40dmg..)<br />
<br />
<br />
It is still crap compare to the old alchemist stone. +15 ALL stats is superior in more ways then one, to most classes.<br />
<br />
To make it more then equal to the old alchemist stone, they should add attack pwr to the +crit one, stam to the def+, and +int to the healing/casting one. Only THEN can alchemist be considered getting a better trinket from these alchemist stone compare to the old one.<br />
<br />
As for the flametongue changes, I think you guys worry too much. It is PTR, they are still testing stuff. I'm quite sure they will find &quot;refresh on every hit&quot; part way overpowered after testing and will be tone down significantly.<br />
<br />
They have to give shammy something in arena. They know they are weak, they just need to find out what (I recommend taking cyclone away from druid and giving it to shammy, instead of this try-hard MS warrior bs).</div></div><hr />

shamans are still kind of gimped, even with the buff, they still have to be able to hit for it to work, getting kited there goes the buff, getting stun locked oops there it goes again, frost nova'd, ham stringed, cripplin poisoned, i doubt all those slows and lock downs can all be removed fast enough in 5 seconds to re apply that FT buff. and in arena when enhance shamans get bursted down like crazy, gota put a shield on alot. and with a shield on if u wanna keep FT on you lose mass dps, or if u wanna keep some dps u gota keep WF on. so its not totally over powered it just helps a bit<br />
<br />
Warriors have tons more armory, can intercept and charge, and stick on a target better than a shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that they both have an ms affect, warriors still are harder to kill, harder to kite, and are better for arena<br />
<br />
Rouge poisons are just like a bonus, giving them that ms affect was huge anyways<br />
they are like impposible to kite, got like a million cds they can pop, then prep, then repop. o wow wound poison mite be a little hard to put up but they got all that other crap going for them<br />
<br />
Hunters can just kite around, and have ranged ms, id rather be able to cast a MS effect from 35 yards away then having to be 5 yards away<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
Seriously, people are complaining about the worst spec in the game getting a buff? Give me a break. Even with these changes Enhancement shaman can still be kited around forever. If you let one get into melee range you deserve that 50% healing debuff, because it's stupidly easy to avoid.</div></div><hr />
