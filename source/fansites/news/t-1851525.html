Armory Stats - Patch 6.2 Class Representation<br />
It is time to look at Class Representation once again, before everyone becomes a Demon Hunter in Legion! This time we are only including characters that have been active since June 1, 2015. We last looked at this data during Patch 6.1 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4773-BRF-Item-Level-Increase-Effects-Class-Representation-by-Ilvl-Blue-Tweets-DLC-481), but did not only include recently active characters then, so the data isn't directly comparable. <br />
<br />
This sample includes 5.9 million characters for all item levels, 3.4 million for 655+, 2.4 million for 665+, 1.7 million for 675+, 677k for 690+, 205k for 700+, and 51k for 710+. Keep in mind that the higher the item level, the smaller the sample size, which means a less than perfect reflection of the actual class balance at that item level range.<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW and game design. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Player Feedback<br />
What is your process at Riot for reviewing feedback? Sometimes I feel we can't get rito attention without a huge post on reddit with a bunch of stupid memes, but every once in a while, someone will post a real discussion to no avail. It is frustrating that we feel like our feedback never matters.<br />
There isn't a formalized process because as you can imagine the discussion itself is nuanced. We need to evaluate sentiment in all regions, evaluate potential changes against work already in flight, and try and understand if we are hearing from a vocal minority or someone being the spokesperson for a whole bunch of players.<br />
<br />
We don't think the long red post on Reddit really scales well. We are trying to figure out some other options to get our feedback to your feedback out there. A suggestion we hear a lot is some kind of regular state of the game blog.<br />
<br />
I have been talking to players on social media for nearly two decades now and I have experienced this sentiment a lot: that you guys don't feel heard. It's a challenging problem to solve in the absence of an announcement from us that says &quot;we are making the change you suggested in the next patch.&quot; To be clear, sometimes that is going to happen. But there are many reasons that may not happen. If you're asking for a new feature and we are going to announce that feature in a big way in a few weeks, we aren't going to answer on social media and you may feel ignored. As I said we are exploring options for how to make sure you guys understand better what it is we value. We have gotten that message loud and clear. <br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
now i know you don't work for blizzard anymore but can you explain why they seem so threatened by new mmos or expansions for current mmos releasing?<br />
I'm not sure if you are refering to a specific incident or something, but when I was there, there wasn't an excessive focus on what competitors did. It's actually pretty challenging in the game industry, and especially in the MMO space, to tactically respond to competitors. If they announce a new feature, you're probably 4 months away from being able to ship a competiting feature. If they want to launch on a certain day, you have very limited ability to pivot, because you probably locked into your own launch day 6 months ago. <br />
<br />
So you are saying that Blizzard and Valve are reckless for implementing features that LoL doesn't have like voice chat?<br />
I'm not qualified to talk about how Valve makes decisions. I would just be guessing. Blizzard is generally a very deliberate, almost cautious decision-maker, or at least they were two years ago. I would point to their voice chat as a rare misstep though (they would be the first to acknowledge that it isn't very good compared to third party alternatives, and isn't frequently used) so maybe that's not the strongest example to make your point.<br />
<br />
This also doesn't mean adding voice is always a reckless idea. I just mean you need to be really careful about how you roll out some features that risk having more problems than benefits. <br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Do you feel like you're currently making the exact same design mistakes that you previously made at Blizzard? Specifically regarding caring more about new players than old?<br />
Almost everything we do on League is for existing players. In fact, our new player experience is in pretty desperate need of being updated. We will get to it someday.<br />
<br />
On WoW we did focus more on new players. They are just different companies with different priorities. I try to align my priorities to the company I'm at. But I will point out that I annoyed some players by focusing on more challenging dungeons on WoW. <br />
<br />
How does it feel to have completely screwed up WoW, only to get hired at Riot and do the same thing again?<br />
In both cases, I'm just one person on a large team. I have no problem if you want to hold me accountable for design decisions you don't like on either game, but it's pretty unfair to hundreds of people at Blizzard and Riot to imagine that any one person could steer the direction of either game so dramatically. <br />

The Wildstar team announced (http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-08-19-level-up-with-cosmic-rewards/) the system that will unlock game features and cosmetic rewards once the game goes free to play. Players will unlock tiers by purchasing things in the in-game store. The more they spend, the more tiers will be unlocked. Players that don't want to spend any money on the game can still unlock things by using C.R.E.D.D. (Wildstar equivalent of the WoW Token).<br />

<br />
Right now, hunters have very high dps for low complexity, lots of utility, great mobility, and 0 competition for their weapon (more for trinkets/gear, but still not as much as cloth/leather/plate). They don't have to swap specs to fulfill niche rolls on specific fights (unlike rogues, arguably locks, etc). They aren't locked into a specific playstyle (Monks). <br />
<br />
There's a lot of reasons, really. Encounter design. Solo or raid-friendly play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the utility + mobility + ranged component gives high fun factor. Plus the class works well in both PvP and PvE. Another reason for many hunters is simply the cosmetic aspect (pun intended) - Lots of different pet options as opposed to Locks, UH dks or frost mages. <br />
<br />
Personal opinion here, but raiding on a hunter can be a chore if everyone asks you for bitch duty.</div></div><hr />

I would like to hear your thoughts about what i wrote in this thread (monk forum)<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1848729-Really-excited-with-the-6-2-2-buffs-to-WW?p=35781445&amp;viewfull=1#post35781445<br />
<br />
Anyway, as it's clearly shown, monks are the least played.<br />
That's what happens when you make a class that requires almost perfect play JUST to be around the same dps as other more simple classes.<br />
And also don't even give them any raid utility.<br />
<br />
Calimonk said in FnialBoss stream, she thinks blizz made the class bad ON PURPOSE, because they are gonna revamp the class in a major way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because hunters have only been the most played class this tier and are not always one of the most played right? People find them fun, get over it. I have played my hunter since I started in BC because to me having a pet and a bow is the most fun playstyle and it is for plenty others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not very competitive.<br />
They're difficult to play in all specs. They don't require a huge amount of theory crafting, they just have a lot more buttons to push compared to some more 2-dimensional classes.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope they don't dumb them down to increase representation...but those numbers are just depressing. Only class to dip below 5%...<br />
<br />
Also, what's with the marked decrease in Hunters? That's a pretty sharp drop (3%)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just my opinion ofc but I think the release of the DH will hit the monk-community a lot harder than the rogue one. We don't know much about the new class yet but from what we've seen it looks more similar to monk with a DPS/tank option. Rogues still have the whole stealth aspect which I'm sure is the main reason most rogues are playing rogue to begin with.<br />
<br />
I'm a hunter myself and have been for nearly 10 years.

You likely need to calibrate your monitor's color. Windows has something built in, just search for calibrate color.<br />

<br />
and no one's pointed out they screwed up the colours in the graph?<br />
<br />
what does the percentage even mean?.. it says % of total, but... do you have to get the average % of each class to get their overall representation percentage?<br />
<br />
it says say 5.74, 5.24, 5.05, 4.87, 4.86, 5.12, 5.34 or 36.22%<br />
<br />
does this mean that 63.78% of all monks are &lt;level 100 (or at least less than....<br />
<br />
wait no, the 5.74 is 'all'<br />
<br />
so what do the other percentages mean?<br />
<br />
Colors appear to be fine to me. Bars are class colors and legend colors are unrelated. 5.74 means that 5.74% of all level 100 characters are monks. The 5.24% is 5.24% of all level 100 characters with an item level of 655 or higher are monks, and so on. It is pretty clear to me. <br />

<br />
They're not very competitive.<br />
They're difficult to play in all specs. They don't require a huge amount of theory crafting, they just have a lot more buttons to push compared to some more 2-dimensional classes.<br />

I'd say 3 reasons. Third reason being that the class is only 1 expansion old.</div></div><hr />

Great tier to play a hunter or pug with one. Highly desired for raids and easy to pick up. Great dps. Tends to be a lot of them in pugs. Mages are also popular on the alt front this tier, especially with Frost being viable. Some of those melee classes seem to really dropoff before the 710+ bracket though, maybe due to it being more difficult for melee to get in groups. 710+ is mostly the guild raids/main toons.</div></div><hr />

Actually I think this is pretty good representation considering that they were only released last xpac. When you have so many people that have come back from WoD who were previously not subbed through MoP. What should be alarming is the rogue representation a class that has been present since the beginning. It may give credence to some of the rogue concerns regarding lack of uniqueness across specs and even class identity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunters need to be nerfed... or bring other classes up to par. As of last week I have 5 classes now to 100 with the rest sitting at 91-92. Hunters were by far the easiest to play with this xpac and many xpacs. Unmatched utility, dps, survivability, soloable... etc.<br />
<br />
I can solo a ton of content by allowing my pet tank. Skip content by stealthing. Drop out of combat when shit gets hairy. They also have a very simple dps rotation, that scales well with gear.<br />
<br />
I actually started with my shaman (which has been crap this xpac) and it wasn't until hellfire citadel patch (because of gear) that they finally started to become competitive dps wise.<br />
<br />
Blizzard USED to do their balance tuning on a constant basis with each content release responding to performance during previous patch. Now they do all their tuning at the beginning of the xpac according to the ilvl of the final content release. The problem lies with how each class scales with gear...<br />
<br />
Why would someone spend the entire xpac being mediocre when you can play a class that will out perform other simply because blizzard refuses to balance.</div></div><hr />

True, but these aren't new or exciting numbers. Monks barely topped out at 6% for max level characters back in MoP. The classes that have actually a hit this expansion are Mages and Priests, with Warriors having the biggest gains.</div></div><hr />

so Hunters OVERALL are 13.61% of the population, but out of ALL the people with an ilvl of 710+ only 12.91% are Hunters.<br />
<br />
And GG blizz, introduce another melee leather class when monks and rogues are already the lowest represented. I still don't get what is wrong with Demon Hunters wearing mail when shamans and hunters do. I mean ALL the NE looked like they wear the same type in WC3.

Hunters get a bad rep from the huntards running around, is the reality. I know there are damned good hunters playing, I ran into them and had a few in my guild, but the overwhelming majority of them are kids running around being douchenozzles and going &quot;I'm Legolas, pew pew!&quot;, or they're playing the class because it's EZMode.<br />
<br />
It's why I've never been able to level one - even if you try to be good, people treat you differently when on a hunter alt. <br />

I get the pet class thing - i learned it with my Lock. But I just can't level a hunter.<br />

Nah. Rogues have actually increased their proportion in relation to Monks since the end of MoP. It was 6.6% Rogues, 6.1% Monks at the end of MoP; now it's 7.1% Rogues, 5.7% Monks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not really a good measure... I mean my monk's main spec is Mistweaver, I have over a 700 ilvl <br />
<br />
But my os is WW I use that for running dalies, farming old raids for transmog... no crafted gear in this spec (have neck, weapon, trinket for healing spec), still have blue 650 dropped in tannan weapon... so basically my os has shit gear because well I don't care it's her off spec, I never raid or do dungeons in it.<br />
<br />
But 90% of the time when I log out it's after doing dallies, or running an old raid (still need 1 more piece for my firelands look-alike transmog set), farming felblight... so it'll show her in her shitty dps gear. So I go from being in the 700+ monks to the 650ish monks just because of the ilvls of things like the weapons, ring, and back which are spec specific (and I really can't be bothered with doing too much) <br />
<br />
<br />
Just my opinion ofc but I think the release of the DH will hit the monk-community a lot harder than the rogue one.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking they will hit the DKs more than any other class... because a DH is basically just the new DK. Monks are great (I main one, I should know) but they are nor a hero class. DH's are a hero class and I'm sure every one who made a DK to faceroll with back in LK is going to make one and we'll see that dynamic drop down a little bit. As it's a DPS/Tank class, vs monk who has a healer as well and there will still be that advantage to them over a pure dps or a dps tank class like DK or Rogue.</div></div><hr />

It's easy, It's not gimped in a fight where you have to move, the dps is competative and they're good in PvP. They don't have a single weakness except for self heals but meh. <br />

Nah, it`s fked up. Just check the color description under the bars like grey-all, white-655+, pinkish or skinlike:D - 660+, etc. The bars supposed to be different color at each class, like the description says, but instead they did 1 color/class (like 1 bar at monk is grey - all, then 1 white-655+, then 1 green-675+, etc)</div></div><hr />

Shaman and Priest numbers down, the former likely to Ele and Enh deemed to be subpar DPS (as has been mentioned, a spec based chart might reveal a high percentage of resto). With Priests, Shadow has been looked down on since MoP, we have fights we can shine on but they are few and far between. Because of the way our talents interact with stats, Blizz struggle to balance the spec to account for extra orb generation. For healing Priests, Disc being perceived as the only viable spec has pushed the Holy Priest community into a spec they don't enjoy, or into a different class entirely.<br />
<br />
Hits to the Warlock population to be expected when their current iteration is measured against them being King of the Castle in SoO, combined with the Demonology clusterfuck. Rogues actually saw a small gain vs 6.0.2 possibly due to their niche DPS actually not being bad (just inconvenient to keep switching on a fight by fight basis). I enjoy my Monk alt but agree they are needlessly complex when placed alongside their peers in each role. Their niche toolkit seems to fit mythic well though judging by the upturn in well geared vs baleful kit. Can't really explain the gain in Warrior numbers, if I was to hazard a guess I'd say it's a relatively simple rotation (I'm looking at you, Arms) producing great results.<br />

Basically, all the classic tanking classes (plus hunters who have cool mechanics (pets which are mini-tanks) and cool iconography (bows, guns)) make up the top slots and the newest class is struggling to find a place in a very crowded field. <br />
<br />
There is no universe of perfect class balance where druids, paladins, and hunters do not have more representation than other classes. They are too versatile and have too much built in cool.</div></div><hr />

It's maybe mildly surprising that hunters make up 15% of the population (I would have guessed 12-13) but there are 11 classes so perfect &quot;balance&quot; numerically would be 9% for each.

<br />
If other classes got more utility/cool stuff to make up for the lack of versatility, things would be more balanced.<br />

Monks..well. We didn't need another melee dps, we didn't need another leather class (hi, DH...), as a tank they're one of the more perplexing and demanding to play effectively. I can't speak for them as healers--don't have experience. I will say, though--right now the queues wait on healers, not tanks, and I think that has to do with the challenge new players/alts have swapping to heals from dps/tanking. It's an entirely different skillset/playstyle, and honestly demands quite a bit more in general than tanking or dpsing imho.</div></div><hr />

You're right about monks and i think you're right about the issue with healing. I main shadow and while i had a lot of fun healing 90-100 dungeons, the heroics were a slap in the face to my skills and the groups i was with were VERY unfriendly about it, especially given the short amount of time the game had been out. I suppose its fair to say i jumped in too soon but i had to pass the ilvl check and get silver healing so its not like i was a complete scrub either. You can't be an average healer with a group of soft dps and a new tank though. <br />
<br />
As far giving other classes cool, i'm not opposed to giving out more love but seriously, what could you possibly give rogues that compete with a class that transforms into animals and can tank/heal/dps/dps (druids) or a class that tanks/dps/heals (paladins), or hunters who get cool animals and can solo stuff easier and such. Its going to be tough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For A LOT of us playing this game we like the idea of having &quot;one main character&quot; that we do everything on. Besides raiding that's stuff like PVP (if that's to your liking), collecting pets, mounts and other various items, questing, doing world events and holiday events, soloing old content for whatever reason and the list goes on and on and on. If your main is a fire mage or an elemental shaman you might have fun while raiding with your friends but you also might find yourself gimped while attempting to do stuff on your own. This is a big turnoff for a lot of people. Hunter just fits a lot better into the fantasy of that one hero where you don't need to have alts do certain stuff. It's the main reason why I can't see myself maining anything else.<br />
<br />
I had hoped that the addition of bodyguards in WoD would solve this issue but well.. we all know how that turned out :)<br />
<br />
I also think the fact that hunters feel so superior in raids right now is that encounters are getting more and more complex, and more often than not this means a lot more movement, making a hunter feel smooth where you have high to infinite movement with slight to no DPS loss. Sure you could keep tuning hunter damage down and static caster dmg up but all that would do in the end is break the game outside raids or simply make hunters useless at the end of tiers. Making all classes equally desirable for the content outside raids seems like a much better option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same on my DK...I like the dw frost but always found myself playing with a 2 hand..artifacts will solve this issue..finally your spec will not depend on the rng.</div></div><hr />

I don't care what is he speaks about WoW. JUST DON'T REPOST IT! it is that simple... He can live in his barbie world with his dreams, who cares? He was &quot;removed&quot; from the company and the project. He is just a random man who says his own crap.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Just a random man who says his own crap&quot; describes every commenter on this website (with appropriate respect for the boys, girls, and women). <br />
<br />
...and yet, these people feel validated in their own thoughts and feelings, believing that others will care to read them. <br />
<br />
Just get over it already. I don't give a shit about the Sports section of my daily newspaper but I don't complain about it every day; it's obnoxious and immature.</div></div><hr />
