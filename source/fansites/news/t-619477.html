Echoes of Doom Update<br />
Echoes of Doom, the new World of Warcraft content patch that sets the stage for the upcoming release of Wrath of the Lich King, is now live. The patch brings many changes and additions to the game, including the new achievements system, the inscription profession, changes to class and buff mechanics, new talents, and more.<br />
<br />
Since the release of the patch, we have experienced some realm instability as many players logged in to the game for the first time and began to access the new achievement system, resulting in a large amount of data being transferred at once. This led to a variety of issues, including player disconnects and general lag within the game. We have since applied optimizations to improve these issues, and we expect stability to continue to improve in the coming days.<br />
<br />
During the initial instability, some players experienced a loss of mounts or pets after attempting to add them to the new mount and pet interface. We have since resolved this issue and will continue to replace lost mounts and pets for players who have experienced this problem.<br />
<br />
We also wanted to address the concern some players have expressed over the balance between classes now that the new talents (including the new 51-point talents), spells, and abilities are in the game. As with the Before the Storm patch released prior to the launch of The Burning Crusade, many of the changes in Echoes of Doom are intended to act as a bridge to the next expansion and are meant to give players a chance to play with some of the new changes prior to Wrath of the Lich King's release. As such, they have been designed with the 10 additional levels and new gear players will receive in Northrend in mind. While we performed balance testing for level 70 gameplay, our focus was on gameplay beyond level 70. As always, class balancing is an ongoing process, and we will continue to monitor the effects of these new talents, abilities, and spells on the overall game.<br />
<br />
We'd like to thank everyone for their patience during this transition, and we look forward to seeing you all in Northrend! <br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Retribution Paladin Changes<br />
As I stated yesterday, we are happy with Ret's PvE damage and sustatined damage in PvP, but were concerned that the burst damage in PvP could be too high. We discussed this for literally hours yesterday, which was certainly not the first time we have discussed the issue. Thus I hope these changes are not perceived as a knee-jerk reaction, but I am sure that will depend a great deal on which class you play. <br />
<br />
Divine Storm -- the damage was changed from Holy to Physical. As you know, Holy damage is almost never mitigated and this talent could pack a lot into a very short time. This is a nerf to the ability's damage. This change is now active on Live.<br />
<br />
Repentance -- this ability now lasts for only 6 seconds in PvP (down from 10). Obviously this is also a nerf. This change is also active on Live.<br />
<br />
Art of War -- now affects all damage done by Judgements, Crusader Strike and Divine Storm (instead of critical strike damage). Net dps should be about the same but less bursty. This change will be made before Nov 13.<br />
<br />
Righteous Vengeance -- now applies a dot affect similar to Deep Wounds (instead of critical strike damage). This ends up being a significant buff to the ability to make up for the damage lost to Divine Storm, but is also less bursty. This change will be made before Nov 13. EDIT: The dot will NOT break Repentance.<br />
<br />
Glyph of Crusader Strike -- now reduces mana cost (instead of increased damage on stunned targets.) We thought paladins could stack too much damage vs. stunned targets. This change will be made before Nov 13.<br />
<br />
We also fixed a bug with Seal and Judgement of Light that could sometimes result in too much healing.<br />
<br />
In our tests, Retribution dps remains the same over longer periods of time, but they can't do quite so much damage in the initial few seconds of a PvP encounter.<br />
<br />
I know Ret pallies feel a little picked on since we've made this mistake before of having them come out the gate too strong and then had to correct them. For that I do apologize. It's a difficult spec to balance since part of its design is to have large crits and stuns, which have obvious PvP implications. We are pretty confident this will not nerf pallies into the ground as I facetiously promised yesterday, but if we overdid it, we'll be happy to back off some of the changes.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, maybe we'll see fewer BGs with 20 paladins on the opposing side and can get some reasonable feedback on all the other classes in the game.<br />
<br />
EDIT: To clairfy the new dot will not break Repentance. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Small change to Master Demonologist<br />
The Felguard magic damage reduction now extends to Holy. I believe this was hotfixed yesterday.<br />
<br />
Typically we don't change Holy resistance (which this is not), but it's consistent with other damage reduction abilities (which this is) to reduce all magic damage. This should help warlocks stand up to paladins in particular in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
same story happened when lvl 60s got CS, and ret was nerfed because at 60 was OP, but at 70 was lolret, now at 80 is gonna happen the same<br />
<br />
also the more you QQ from people does not make it go fast, Druids it took blizzard more than 8 months to fix them, when they had Godmode, and were unkillable by a single player, you needed around 5 people to kill a single resto druid... 8 months os constant QQ and no answer until now :S</div></div><hr />

Definitely like the deep wounds effect that DS gets now though, but any idea of the duration/type of dot (magic/physical). You will still do a lot of dmg, especially to those squishy clothies :P</div></div><hr />

WOW i understand the burst dmg being nurfed (although i would have reather seen DS stay holy dmg and be taken down to 75% of wep dmg instead of physical...just wow) <br />
.....<br />
BUT seriously the only cc that ret has and i dont consider HoJ one of them was Repentance and now it last 6 secs which means in pvp the person will sit through it instead of havin to trinket it.... LOLRET it is....<br />
<br />
oh and <br />
EDIT: To clairfy the new dot will not break Repentance. <br />
<br />
LOL wuts the fuking point it only last 6 secs not like its a viable cc in pvp anymore... nice going blizz for making yet another retarded change ... no surprises here<br />

<br />
HoJ is a phenominal CC. So is repentance @ 6 seconds. Frost nova lasts 6 seconds and I'd bet you consider it a good cc... And &quot;I don't consider HoJ a cc&quot;. Seriously?<br />
<br />
Why can't people just curb their over-reaction for 2 minutes. This person isn't even close to rational. The biggest change might be the glyph and SoC change that this person didn't even notice... ::)</div></div><hr />

QQ by the way<br />
<br />
Can't say I'm surprised, many smartasses on the forums wrote endless posts about how fine Retribution is, well you were wrong, and there's your only needed fact.<br />
<br />
Oh, and what's wrong is Holy Damage by itself, it should either be added to resists or just removed alltogether.<br />
Least amount of CC ? Ever heard of a Shaman ? Oh wait you probably didn't, because they're the least played class in WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not everyone should have CC + Heal + Damage + Bubble + whatnot, that's what makes characters different and special, you want everyone to have the same skills ? Go play CS.</div></div><hr />

Did you really think that doing that much burst damage in open PVP is viable to the game? Its enough to make people stop PvPing until the expansion its that bad. <br />
<br />
I wanted to see how long i could survive without healing against a ret pally yesterday to see what the changes were like, I was killed buy a season 2 ret pally in 4 seconds. It was retarded, and I have 440 resilience and 12k health. <br />
<br />
Ret pallies have a right to be on a par with every other class, no one will deny them that, but when they are ridiculously over buffed in the burst damage department it HAS to be changed for PvP. All I saw yesterday was ret pallies key mashing and killing people within seconds with no skill whatsoever. There needs to be a balance where they put out competitive DPS in PvE content while being able to have the mechanics to compete well against other classes in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If I didn't play a Paladin (since I'm a good guy and Paladins are protectors and users of Light, no evil side of them except maybe Retri kids), I'd most likely play a Shaman. They're pretty interesting, so I have no idea why more people doesn't play them.<br />
<br />
But at least you get a CC at 80, and a pretty good one too. Hex. :)<br />
<br />
And yes, Retri Paladins deserve a nerf. Except Repentance, that was totally uncalled for.</div></div><hr />

Everyone can do huge amounts of burst damage. Retadins had a bit more, so I'll be interested to see how this nerf affects me.<br />

In all honesty they can go on nerfing our damage, the core aspect of the class has been fixed which is MANA (JotW). I think myself and many other ret pallies will continue to be happy because of this, remembering what it was like before when we were oomadins.</div></div><hr />

If you had gotten a true knee-jerk reaction (like the great bear nerf) it would've been something like DS damage cut in half (hurts PvE and PvP), CS damage cut by 1/3, and vengeance only affecting auto-attack.</div></div><hr />

Nice, honestly, any class is easy to kill when they're stunlocked/rooted/silenced.<br />

Yeah, I think your hope will happen. speaking for myself I'm still really happy with my class. Even if we end up getting massacred by all classes in PvP, I will still have a ton of fun playing my pally while farming :D It's so much fun now, whereas before it was kill three mobs really quickly, drink, kill three mobs quickly, drink... zzzzzz...<br />
<br />
Now farming feels a lot more like my feral druid, except that I have a lot more OH SH@! buttons. It definitely is not a chore like it used to be.</div></div><hr />

I can back you up on this Sethorex, I was in BGs yesterday and was up against a t6 enh shaman (t6 I think, he at least had some pieces on that looked like t6), I utterly destroyed him with my stuns (and I'm in s2). Then again, there was a WSG with a resto shammy with some t6 and she was IMPOSSIBLE to kill. Resto droods are really the only ones that are easiest of the healers to kill now, well them and priests depending on spec..<br />
<br />
I'll be really interested to see if this has changed with the nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, for ret, nothing hit too hard, you got a lot of sustained DPS in trade for the burst, I fail to see the &quot;huge&quot; nerfs. Repentence is the only iffy one, but then you can work around it anyway, somehow warriors and shamans have worked on basically no CC for all this time and can do well, and I've seen enough ret pallies with at least S3/4 weapons...</div></div><hr />

Did you really think that doing that much burst damage in open PVP is viable to the game? Its enough to make people stop PvPing until the expansion its that bad. <br />
<br />
I wanted to see how long i could survive without healing against a ret pally yesterday to see what the changes were like, I was killed buy a season 2 ret pally in 4 seconds. It was retarded, and I have 440 resilience and 12k health. <br />
<br />
Ret pallies have a right to be on a par with every other class, no one will deny them that, but when they are ridiculously over buffed in the burst damage department it HAS to be changed for PvP. All I saw yesterday was ret pallies key mashing and killing people within seconds with no skill whatsoever. There needs to be a balance where they put out competitive DPS in PvE content while being able to have the mechanics to compete well against other classes in PvP.<br />
<br />
There are Enhancement Shamans which do exactly the same... do i hear anyone whine about it? No.<br />
For once the Ret pala was useful and wasnt a freekill anymore all classes stopped &quot;lol'ing&quot; and started &quot;mimimi&quot; ... fu Blizz for give a s**t about what Paladins think - reducing the damage okay, but cut off all the fun is too much.<br />
<br />
god i hate those whiners... i play a Paladin since a long time, i always had to deal with &quot;ololadin&quot; and so on - it wont never change i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me edit it for you....they kill me in the time it takes for me to swing twice...even though im stunned the entire time...is that better for you? can your simple mind process that?<br />
<br />
<br />
i can back this up too.. on my enhance shaman 400ish resil:<br />
<br />
i ran past a pally on my mount.. he repentanced me .. 1 second later my 11k hp was down to 6k... i read a lot about ret pally being OP so i started to run.. hoj, another swing.. and im dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what sort of enhancement shamans you are seeing but none of those I have met have burst me from full to dead while keeping me stunned all the time. The stun makes the world of difference since you can still defend yourself when not stunned. Ask yourself how much damage that shaman does when he is stunned. By all accounts enh damage is going to be toned down a bit too though it seems. Even still, your argument at best works out to saying &quot;its ok for Ret to be overpowered as long as one other class spec is too&quot;. It's a fallacious argument. <br />

Funny, I have been raiding end game as a Ret paladin since the MH/BT patch and the spec has been fine since then. The only place where Ret still had trouble was getting into heroics and a lot of that had to do with poor ret paladins who just spammed burst DPS and pull aggro. Played well you could add a lot to a group, a well timed bubble and some holy lights saved many a wipe.<br />
<br />
CS, Stun, White Hit, Seal Proc, Divine Storm, Judge, White hit, CS, Stun Fades, White Hit, Hammer of Wrath.<br />
<br />
That is 10 attacks all of which hit for 1k+. With a fairly average 2 or 3 crits out of that lot you are going to kill anybody short of a tank. Most classes won't get off more than a white hit during that lot. Anyone seriously trying to argue that that is balanced should rightly be laughed at.<br />
<br />
The most important change is that doing some spot healing as a Ret paladin in those instances is now ezmode, cast your instant heals when they proc (and they are much better heals now with all the spell power you get). Good instance CC in repentance and damage that is much improved.<br />
<br />
Ret paladins have not been a free kill or useless for quite some time now and people claiming they were don't have a lot of credibility. On live the combination of huge burst, stuns and the ability to cast some serious amounts of healing along with having practically infinite mana was nothing short of ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Plz stop the QQ about nerfing ret pallies, DS, and crit damages, and survivability(and they let it on the same lvl:)) were insane, and don't forget that we can still be &quot;rebuffed&quot; on lvl 80, if we come out too weak. Blizzard is doing much better job on balancing, and they react way faster, so plz try not to be pessimistic, it does not make any good for anyone. And lets hope the best for us ;)<br />

The damage isnt too much but the burst is. The burst damage is just too powerful. I ran in and racked up 4 kills in 20 seconds - I am not joking...seriously OP. I do well in BGs - I am always in top 20% for damage, but this was ridiculous. Ret needed fixes to make them more viable in PvE and PvP (arenas). I like what blizz has done mostly, BUT the initial burst damage is too OP.<br />
<br />
Some ideas,<br />
I like the idea of lowering Divine Storm damage, but keep it holy - that sounds more Paladin-like. Repentance can have a 6 second duration - but reduce the cooldown time. Changing the Crusader Strike Glyph is yucky...mana reduction? Come on...How about the glyph causes an extra 5% damage?<br />
<br />
I did get wasted and cc'd fast when people ganged up on me - which was a lot because I was wrecking them 1v1.<br />

Everyone, including myself, seemed to die off fast - did they change resilance or something?</div></div><hr />

They have said serveral times that all new talents and abilitys are tuned for 80.<br />
<br />
That makes me think, why the hell do they release a content patch when they've even alpha + beta + ptr tested it??<br />
Is it to nerf it &quot;TO THE GROUND BABY&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, when are these changes coming live? I've heard that it's &quot;on&quot; in the us servers, but not in the eu yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Honestly, yeah. I have a mostly Sunwell geared (rest being S4) rogue with 300 res (don't laugh on a rogue that's pretty high), unbuffed 2400 and change AP, both 4pc T6 and S4 bonuses that I spend a **LOT** of time on. I've spent many hours in arenas, bg's, and raiding to get to where I am, and I play pretty damn well I might add. So yeah, because I spent all this time, I expect to slice through 99% of the people I see, and I do. Nothing special about me, just this is an MMORPG, and if you get someone with a little degree of skill and a lot of time to build their toon, regardless of class, they'd be the same way.<br />
<br />
But when some scrub in s1 and s2 gear who is keyboard turning can press two buttons and take me down, then yeah, that's imba.<br />

That said, the vast majority of paladins were idiots. Pre-nerf they were beatable. Now they will earn their nickname Lolret back. ;)</div></div><hr />

This ends up being a significant buff to the ability to make up for the damage lost to Divine Storm, but is also less bursty. This change will be made before Nov 13. EDIT: The dot will NOT break Repentance.<br />
<br />
I want to discuss about that.<br />
This means we are nerfed by our dps.<br />
Ghostcrawler stated, that it will be around 40% of crit dmg over 8 seconds.<br />
But there are two abilitys that can procc this DoT and I think the first will be refreshed by the following.<br />
<br />
This means, if you hit critical with Judgement and Divine Storm in a row, Righteous Vengeance cannot tick to its end until it gets refreshed, so you will just have only one DoT on the target but you did 2 crits and the benefit of the first crit gets lost.<br />
<br />
Together with the fact, that Divine Storm has been changed to phys. dmg. the DoT should be a buff to Righteous Vengeance, but it doesn't seem to be so.<br />
<br />
Blizzard stated it will only be a fix to burst dmg, while dps remains the same.<br />
<br />
So I rly hope, that there will be two different DoTs on the Target, one for Judgement and one for Divine Storm.<br />
Otherwhise, this is a nerf to pve dps, no matter what Blizzards tests show.<br />
I will test it, and if I don't have 1500 solo dps again, as I had before, I will complain about this change and many ppl will follow.<br />

<br />
<br />
If as Blizzard say that the problem was caused by the big one time bandwidth hit of lots of people checking their achievements for the first time then it is quite likely that the problem wouldn't of shown up on the PTR where there wouldn't ever have been a huge influx of players like the live realms saw on patch day.<br />
<br />
As for the patch itself, the overall feeling I get in my guild is that everyone is having a lot of fun since the patch. Everyone is loving achievements, our raiding that was dead for the last few weeks is reinvigorated since nobody cares if you bring a bunch of alts or pug people to BH/MH as it just doesn't matter anymore. Yeah, there isn't much challenge there anymore but it is nice to be able to steamroller though the bosses for a couple of weeks at a time when the gear is soon going to become obsolete anyway.<br />
<br />
In effect Blizzard have rebalanced those instances based on the current worth of the gear. It is no longer top end raid gear, it has become levelling gear and the difficulty has been adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
The worst side affect of the patch though is that it killed the wowace updater. So I am without a lot of mods again (and not really missing most of them tbh),</div></div><hr />

You haven't tried the new rogue talents? Or are you just talking in your head? I'm in S3/S4 gear, with s2 weapons, and have no real issue with Retripaladins, well their burst is a bit high at the moment, but so are all classes. This patch is clearly not out to make everything balanced, as some might think. The problem with RetPaladins is not the damage, it the utility with the damage in PVP. As they can heal, they buff, the do high dmg, they have a lot of defensive abilities. That combined makes them to strong at the moment in PVP, and that is not cause of their &quot;wow&quot; 5k burst.<br />
<br />
With assassination spec, I can CS/KS, then my target is usually dead (except paladins, since they can bubble/hand of freedom). Mutilate does sick amount of dmg, and evi for around 3k. Nobody has the health or the healing power to outlast the current dmg from most classes. That just how it is. <br />
<br />
53% crit with mutilate and 48% crit with eviscerate. Thats, well fun.<br />
<br />
Try to stun them, then nuke them like any other class. I feel more for warriors atm, cause they seemed like a joke when trying out some battlegrounds same with all kinds of shamans.</div></div><hr />

Second, for ret, nothing hit too hard, you got a lot of sustained DPS in trade for the burst, I fail to see the &quot;huge&quot; nerfs. Repentence is the only iffy one, but then you can work around it anyway, somehow warriors and shamans have worked on basically no CC for all this time and can do well, and I've seen enough ret pallies with at least S3/4 weapons...<br />

Sure, there are bad everythings. But few specs have been as lol as ret. I can't even think of a spec that has been as mocked or ridiculed and completely ignored. The mocking etc doesn't matter, it is the social opinion. If 99% of people think ret is fail, it doesn't matter how well you play you don't get a chance to show it.</div></div><hr />

Every time some blue poster says something it either &quot;nerf paladins&quot; or buff some other class to deal with paladins. Come on, Felguard has holy resistance now!

<br />
<br />
They have said serveral times that all new talents and abilitys are tuned for 80.<br />
<br />
That makes me think, why the hell do they release a content patch when they've even alpha + beta + ptr tested it??<br />
Is it to nerf it &quot;TO THE GROUND BABY&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, when are these changes coming live? I've heard that it's &quot;on&quot; in the us servers, but not in the eu yet.<br />

If it's *any* consolation, Retribution Paladins have the same amounts of insane burst, on beta, on level 80.<br />

There are more such things. Priest being the dedicated and best healer? Shaman being one of three tanks (Paladins weren't one of them)? Dig deep enough and you'll find a lot of funny things. Hells, Paladins were even designed originally to be more Retribution than anything, and it's been the opposite a long long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy is a type of magic damage, the talent and spell effect &quot;Master Demonologist&quot; as it applies to the Felguard, reduces all damage taken. Apparently it did not affect holy damage as it should because it is a type of damage thus it now takes that into account. It is a hotfix! Not adding holy resistance, please did you even read the patch notes?!<br />
<br />
The Felguard magic damage reduction now extends to Holy. I believe this was hotfixed yesterday.<br />
<br />
Typically we don't change Holy resistance (which this is not), but it's consistent with other damage reduction abilities (which this is) to reduce all magic damage. This should help warlocks stand up to paladins in particular in PvP.</div></div><hr />

We should still have some nice burst potential when SoC procs &amp; we crusader strike or divine storm &amp; judge at the same time.<br />
Having a DoT is nice against rogues &amp; druids &amp; something we've been lacking.<br />
<br />
The only think id say is maybe put a small healing debuff with crusader strike or divine storm if our burst is no longer sufficient to put down casters (which obviously remains to be seen).<br />

For now this patch means ill probably drop a bit of crit on my gems/trinket &amp; pick up a bit more AP.</div></div><hr />

Pleas realy the nerfs for lvl 70 are needed (ret pala myself) and yes the holy-&gt;Physical damage of DS is a bit questionable (we arent wars we are holy beings!!) but indeed the burst damage was OP =P soz have to agree there. But wil we be able to keep up at 80 -.- I DUNNO!!. i tell you this is if we suck balls at 80 bliz wil change the crap again anyways =P to keep balance so QQing about it now wont bring you closer to anything realy. And the useless Glyph of crusaders strike giving a mana reduction instead of extra damage is pretty useless even in a long combat il be able to atleast have 50% mana left (talking about killing 7 8 mobs right after another) and i realy dont care about the pvp nerf i seldomely PvP so realy =p. <br />
<br />
PS did any of you palys notice the hate against palys as of late? I am being attacked by anything of the opposite faction like on sight -.- even when i am attacked by a few mobs realy sad =p even a prot war (pre 3.0.2) could kill someone that way =P realy honerable and realy shows youre imbaness that way NOT!!!!!!!.</div></div><hr />

DONT NERF PALLYS<br />
I like being op, cuz its fun as hell, i like to kill all classes, i like to kill classes more geared than me, or even more experienced<br />
i like to be the top of dps and killing blow chart in bg<br />
i dont care if u guys r not having fun, but i really am and im enjoying it<br />
blizzard should keep pallys or make them god and screw everything else. <br />
<br />
<br />
rofl lol lol. jk <br />
but seriously, if blizz nerfs pallys too much. and they become like losers like before, well, its just not right<br />
First OP class was enhancement shaman at 60, then it was warlock. then warr/hunter/rogue, then rogue again and druid, now its time for Ret pallys to be OP and have a lil fun. i think later DK will be op. who knows, its like a cycle</div></div><hr />

WTF is that ??? A blue energy, not mana. He had the lowest number of kills in the whole BG, not to mention the top 10 places of highest DPS for paladins. Something is SURELY not right. <br />
<br />
he only went down if he was alone and focus fired. But 5 retardins in one spot was a complete devastation.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cab</div><div class="date">2008-10-19, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If as Blizzard say that the problem was caused by the big one time bandwidth hit of lots of people checking their achievements for the first time then it is quite likely that the problem wouldn't of shown up on the PTR where there wouldn't ever have been a huge influx of players like the live realms saw on patch day.<br />
<br />
As for the patch itself, the overall feeling I get in my guild is that everyone is having a lot of fun since the patch. Everyone is loving achievements, our raiding that was dead for the last few weeks is reinvigorated since nobody cares if you bring a bunch of alts or pug people to BH/MH as it just doesn't matter anymore. Yeah, there isn't much challenge there anymore but it is nice to be able to steamroller though the bosses for a couple of weeks at a time when the gear is soon going to become obsolete anyway.<br />
<br />
In effect Blizzard have rebalanced those instances based on the current worth of the gear. It is no longer top end raid gear, it has become levelling gear and the difficulty has been adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
The worst side affect of the patch though is that it killed the wowace updater. So I am without a lot of mods again (and not really missing most of them tbh),<br />
<br />
Um, no - leveling gear is now what you get on blue stuff or from questing until lvl70. If you have raidgear now it has to be overpowered for the next expansion because if new people level up to 80, they wont have T6 gear ..not even T4 or S2! And this is what Blizzard has to take into consideration. Otherwise it would be almost impossible for new people to get to level 80 in green/blue gear. This is also why almost everyone feels overpowered atm - but it will tone down during the next expansion...thats for sure.<br />
<br />
For the Paladin nerfs - do we really want to see lvl80 Loladins again? I say no... they deserve to be buffed - not like they are atm maybe..but Blizzard should at least wait until they Hit lvl 80. On the other Hand - Rogues still can kill me as a Ret, Warlocks still can, Priests ....lol of course, Frostmages ...they never had und will never have any problems killing me. Its just not THAT easy anymore because if we get close...you are pretty much srewed^^ But that should be okay. Just learn how to deal with it and you are fine.</div></div><hr />

Even S2 paladins seems to pwn everyone.<br />
<br />
Its really nice to see that they got some &quot;love&quot; from Blizzard, but dont u think that this &quot;love&quot; has become more like a &quot;passion&quot; ? Did u encounter retribution paladin with a rouge in 2vs2 ? You are dead within seconds. Or did u ever had to deal with 2 retribution paladis in bgs? Its all about stuns and 2k 2k 3k dead!<br />
<br />
At least remove the bubble, or the heals. If are a good dps class e.g warlock which seems to be the only ones that can kill them, imagine the frustration of the player watching a paladin with 300health left bubbling and healing him self up to the maximum.<br />

Bolded and underlined are the specs you mentioned that have more than one choice for DPS. Paladins have one choice and it has been gimped since... erm, when did WoW come out again? Kind of funny how the only gimped spec left was another paladin one. haha GO GO HOLY!<br />
<br />
Second. I never said b/c ret has been terrible it deserves to be made OP so we can have blood to satisfy our nerd rage. <br />
<br />
Third. It isn't like there weren't PTR tests before the patch. WTF. They're suddenly like &quot;HOLY FUCK! DID YOU SEE HOW MUCH DAMAGE THAT PALADIN DID?! NERF THAT SHIT IN THE NEXT DAY OR YOU ARE ALL FIRED!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact that it is hot-fixed in one day blows my mind. They across-the-board nerfed a class in less than a day. They talk shit about how &quot;we can't change this-or-that yet b/c we need more numbers and we need to discuss etc etc&quot; but Paladins, OH SHIT we can get nerfed instantly.<br />

Locks most of the times for me.. Maybe a full brutal player but in general locks and spriests came first..<br />
<br />
Did u notice now the first 3 positions of TOP DPS? RETRIBUTION PALADINS... Its so fuckin obvious that blizzard failed. I mean every level 70 friend appears offline cause they are in Silvermoon city leveling a paladin.. <br />
<br />
However enough with the crying.. Am just saying the truth and i wont even bother reading this again so dont answer me. Am a lock me self and i dont really care if retr.palas are op cause i can beat them to death!<br />
All the crying will end in a few days when level 80 will be available. Study ur talents well, spend endless nights in arena and bgs to get ur gear and then u are good to go.<br />
<br />
PS: Losers with S2 or gear from Kara whinning all day &quot;OMG PALADINS KILL US&quot; log off and delete ur accounts . Oh and the excuse &quot;am working till late..so i dont have time for bgs and arena&quot; IS NOT an excuse..

Can't say much but you are totally right. I play my human paladin for quite long now, since 60 back when BoK was the &quot;ultimate&quot; paladin skill(aka 41 talent pts in retri). I can say that Retribution Paladins were always a class that wasnt respectable and everyone was like: &quot;prefer some real dps rather than you&quot;. I hated that, and it was the reason respeccing to Protection where i had some glorius moments. The fact is that as long as i can remember before TBC was released(1 month or so) back when i was PvPing in Bg's endless hours and raiding active, I was 1shoting players with the &quot;imbah&quot; Crusader Strike, in Battlegrounds. I achieved that by having GM PvP gear and some good PvE too, spent too much time to gear up as Retribution the time noone was accepting my mainspecc. I was raiding as Holy its true, but it was oneway. In TBC i gathered some good gear i can say, and atm im my guilds &quot;Retradin&quot; and at last i can see that i am in the top 3 of DPS and Damage Done. To achieve that tho I spent bunch of hours on my computer, and im coming back to the thing that you said about: &quot;wow is just like life, the more you play the more you achieve&quot; I believe that and im kinda pissed because the game became just -too easy- really now how can everyone have s2 gear w/o even tryin' but &quot;farming&quot; honor and pvp badges to get the gear. Also, I cant stand people complain for the Retribution specc power, as you said you can kill Paladins and i believe so because i have challenged a lot of people to a Duel plus in PvP. Everyone can kill a Retradin and a Retradin can kill everyone, my point is: Learn To Play your class and dont whine about the retribution tree. Warlocks/Rogues/Mages/Priests... everyone can beat Paladin and in my opinion every class is unique in PvP and can prevail but for people that want to do that i suggest them to play their class more and learn and use even the most &quot;useless&quot; ability everywhere because Blizzard may &quot;buff up&quot; classes or &quot;nerf&quot; them but Blizzard spent time in everything, calculating everything, designers arent like: &quot;Oh lets buff retradins before wolk&quot; they know what they do these talents are for level 80 and with 71 talent points pure DPS classes will be in need of a &quot;nerf&quot; because people cant see that retribution paladin is 1 tree and 51 pts are enough to burst as hell. But a rog or a warlock (I like these classes thats why i speak about them) will be far above a retri paladin and thats it. Its ok by me for blizzard to nerf the PvP burst damage of Retribution i dont care but I will be really disapointed if PvE retribution isnt the same anymore. Well, thats it dont have more to say except that WOW is like life the more you &quot;burn&quot; the more you will achieve, If you want to be great focus on something. Cheers. :)</div></div><hr />

You implied it, and many others in this thread have said it outright. Deny that many paladins feel it is their right to be top DPS and top in PVP too after so long, go ahead.<br />

Also, who cares how long they took to fix it. It was in the works for a long time, it just happened to coincide shortly after 3.0 went live. Ret pallies had been OP for a long ass time in Beta, and there was a lot of feedback given to blizz on the subject.</div></div><hr />

So in your twisted mind you accuse me of something I didn't do but that you read into?<br />
<br />
I don't care about Paladins being OP or not. I care about being viable. Yeah, I've heard of Wa/RetP/Sh, but guess what? That team, statistically, didnt go anywhere. Why? No drood or rogue. (partial sarcasm)<br />
<br />
Moreover, I care how long it takes to fix because I'm paying for the same service other classes are. QQ/mock all you want, but dig through blue posts and it is admitted by Blizzard that they knew Resto Droods were OP but that they didn't do anything for over EIGHT MONTHS! Because they were worried about possible ramifications. So they left it for the expansion.<br />
Explain to me how droods can be admittedly OP for eight months but Blizzard has no problems across-the-board nerfing Ret Paladins through a HOTFIX in a SINGLE DAY. Call me paranoid or cynical, but I think that is just down-right wrong.<br />
<br />
Either way I won't know how these nerfs work out until WotLK arrives and everyone is level 80 and doing real raiding and real PvP. To base such a huge nerf on level 70 content and level 70 whining is ridiculous. They didn't change it during their &quot;months&quot; of beta testing, rather they changed it WITHIN FORTY-EIGHT hours of more QQ than has existed since... erm... I can't really remember the last time the forums exploded like this.<br />
<br />
TLDR: You are dumb. I never said that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The forums explode like that every single patch. Ret pallies were nothing special.<br />
<br />
Also, Resto druids were nerfed plenty when people started QQing about them. It's called patch 2.4.0, go read the patch notes.<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch2p43.html<br />
(P.S. that took like 2 minutes of &quot;digging.&quot; Any blue posts you saw would have been made by mere CM's with no power to say that they will get something changed/nerfed, not Devs, and they were worried about Resto druid's PVE viability. Which was extremely valid, because resto druids sucked ass in PVE. They went ahead and nerfed them anyway.)<br />
<br />
And they didn't change it during beta because they were still running their number parses. They said many times during beta that numbers weren't final, but they wanted to finish getting their data (they have MASSIVE spreadsheets) before they drastically changed anything.<br />
<br />
They also probably got more PVP testing in the first 2 days of live than the whole beta test, honestly.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's not like ret pallies are BAD now, they're still very VIABLE, which is your whole &quot;goal.&quot; The changes were widespread, but they weren't huge OMGWTF nerfs. (For an example of that, see feral druids in patch 2.0.12). In fact, they didn't even change your DPS much.<br />
<br />
That combo (W/P/S) was fine against druids. In fact, it was probably the hardest counter resto druids had in 3's from the moment they revamped ret pallies a few content patches ago. It was just slightly lacking *overall.*<br />
<br />
Ok, I guess I'm gonna have to lead your moronic ass through this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But few specs have been as lol as ret. I can't even think of a spec that has been as mocked or ridiculed and completely ignored.<br />
<br />
First you say this. Now you're arguing that the rebalancing they did after 3.0 went live ruined the class and was completely unjustified. YOU. WERE. OP. And you're arguing that you should have stayed OP for 2 more MONTHS?<br />
<br />
That is where I get my statement. And I never said &quot;accuse&quot; specifically, now you're the one talking about stuff &quot;I didn't do but that you read into.&quot;<br />
<br />
See how fucking retarded that statement is? You don't have to say something in some exact format to mean it. Moron.</div></div><hr />
