Drysc finally gave more details about the rating requirements on arena gear in season 3, he also confirmed that players will also be able to buy season 1 weapons. (As a reminder, you will be able to buy season 1 gear with honor)<br />
You will only need a specific rating to purchase the items, it won't be required for their use. If you hit 1900 (for instance, this isn't a final number by any means) you'll be able to purchase and use the items, and if you dip below that you won't be able to buy them, but you'll be able to continue using those you've already purchased. <br />
<br />
We're also well aware that this could potentially encourage players to join higher rated teams for a chance to obtain the items, and at later time we'll be discussing the solution coming that will prohibit it.<br />
<br />
We've stated on numerous occasions that Season 1 items will be available from honor vendors, and this does include weapons. <br />
<br />
Points reset at the beginning of the season 3<br />
Also, we got the confirmation that they don't plan to reset arena and honor points when the season 3 go live.<br />
We currently have no plans to reset honor or arena points whenever season 3 begins. We didn't reset honor or arena points between seasons 1 and 2 and it worked just fine for everybody, so we plan to continue this when season 3 comes around. At this time we also have no plans to reset honor or arena points in any future patch.<br />
<br />
Season 3 release date<br />
And before you ask when the season 3 will go live :<br />
We don't have an ETA for this as of yet. We do plan to give at least two weeks of advance notice to everyone so that they can be prepared for it.<br />
<br />
Changes to Interface in 2.3<br />
There are two new changes to the interface in 2.3 (not 2.2)<br />
<br />
QueryAuctionItems<br />
New argument (bool), setting it to true will retrieve all auction house data (not just 50 items). This can only be used once every 15 minutes. This is intended to reduce our load from add-ons such as auctioneer that are going to download the entire auction house anyways. <br />
<br />
Multi-attachments<br />
When composing mail, there are now “slots”, that you can drag items into (1 is the first slot, 2 is the second slot, etc). Once the mail arrives, you use an “index” to refer to each attachment.<br />
<br />
According to this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=879058320&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#78) the maximum number of slots for mail attachments will be 12<br />
<br />
Titles for killing bosses<br />
Short answer : nop.<br />
C'thun Eye Vanquisher? We do plan to add more titles in the game in the future but not necessarily for just defeating end game bosses. We plan to keep them somewhat rare like they have been so far.<br />
<br />
Ulduar<br />
Salthem updated the &quot;Information on Northrend&quot; post with a few information about Ulduar (http://www.wowwiki.com/Ulduar)<br />
The Iron Dwarfs are involved in the instance Ulduar, which is accessible to both Alliance and Horde, so yes, you should be able to get involved in their story too. I have added this information to the Opening Post.<br />
<br />
Death Knights are nice guys<br />
They're not that evil, they just want to help you.<br />
This was discussed at the Lore &amp; Quest panel at BlizzCon a little while back. The idea is that a character goes to become a Death Knight, is trained as a Death Knight, but then realizes they doen't want to go through with the evil acts they are instructed to perform. So the character finds a new Alliance or Horde home who accept them as a necessary evil (like warlocks) to help them fight their enemies.<br />
<br />
New sound engine in 2.2<br />
In the upcoming content patch 2.2, the in-game sound engine is being changed to a new, exclusively software-based system. This change is being made to allow for a much greater range of compatibility and should result in improved sound performance for many users. The new sound engine provides all of the same features that have always been available in the game, but now extends those features, such as reverb effects, to players who previously couldn’t take advantage of them. This change also allows us greater control and ease in supporting and developing for the wide range of sound hardware, as well as future upgrades and improvements to the in-game sound effects and options.<br />
<br />
While the switch to the new unified sound engine should be seamless for most users, we ask that any players experiencing issues with their sound after the release of the patch please contact technical support after following basic troubleshooting steps at this link : http://www.blizzard.com/support/wow/?id=aww01706p (http://www.blizzard.com/support/wow/?id=aww01706p)<br />
<br />
No more voice chat on PTR<br />
I don't really see why they're doing this, but they've probably got very good reasons. (And maybe that's related to an upgrade of FMOD, the new sound engine, released a few days ago)<br />
At approximately 7:00 PM PDT we will temporarily be disabling Voice Chat on the Public Test Realms. After this is done we will be restarting the PTRs and they will be accessible again shortly thereafter. We will reactive Voice Chat later in the week as we continue testing this exciting new feature.<br />
<br />
[b]New video : Lament of the Highborne[b]<br />
Blizzard released their own version of Lament of the Highborne (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/movies.html#lament) on the official site. The video itself isn't really awesome, but you'll get a chance to see Arthas and Frostmourne in it. If you can't use the Blizzard Downloader I also mirrored the video on Rapidshare (http://rapidshare.com/files/56702419/LamentoftheHighborne.avi).<br />

Okay they want to have easier support of many systems, fair enough, but I surely hope that there is still hardware support for those who got a decent soundcard, anything else would be plain stupid. I don't want to use my CPU for sound calculations if I have bought a 100$ soundcard, a CPU that is already heavily loaded by the way they designed wow.</div></div><hr />

Season 3 Rating requirements<br />
Drysc finally gave more details about the rating requirements on arena gear in season 3, he also confirmed that players will also be able to buy season 1 weapons. (As a reminder, you will be able to buy season 1 gear with honor)<br />
You will only need a specific rating to purchase the items, it won't be required for their use. If you hit 1900 (for instance, this isn't a final number by any means) you'll be able to purchase and use the items, and if you dip below that you won't be able to buy them, but you'll be able to continue using those you've already purchased. <br />
<br />
We're also well aware that this could potentially encourage players to join higher rated teams for a chance to obtain the items, and at later time we'll be discussing the solution coming that will prohibit it.<br />
<br />
We've stated on numerous occasions that Season 1 items will be available from honor vendors, and this does include weapons. <br />
<br />
wow, i didnt know the rating requirement would affect the gear as well, i thought only the weapons, hmm, arena might take a hit...</div></div><hr />

Good to know. <br />

And if rating reqs will be implemented on A3 armor as well, then it's a good thing I'm investing in my A2 right now.</div></div><hr />

That's probably good somehow, it will create a rating gap (probably) and top teams will have A3 armors and weps , and will always face teams with a3 armor and weps</div></div><hr />

I will tell you what i know what will happen. Teams that get their rating to get S3 weapons/gear will get them. Then there will be people who have points fo S3 Weapons/Gear but dont/cant get/have the rating. Blizzard forces some 'restricition' on jumping from team to team ( whatever it is they implement) <br />
<br />
Ok easy way around it. Create a brand new team, made up of people in S3 gear except for the person'(s) who want the rating to spend their points, and boom, 'rating gap' neutralize because those teams are gonna blow by the competition in those ratings, and we will be in a much worse situation than we have now. Right now it is only the hardcore pvpers upset that 'scrubs' are getting Arena gear, but after this requirement i feel that BOTH Casuals/scrubs/hardcore people will be upset. Its my theory anyways...<br />
<br />
Now, im not a 'scrub' player but im by no means uber. What i want to say is our teams actually do try to have a good rating and the highest we have been able to attain was a 1725 for one week, then now we avg about, id say a 1640 avg. Now, that probably goes for a lot of people that really do try. If people cant get rewarded for their efforts then people just wont play....the old honor system all over again.<br />
<br />
Then again, ive proposed this idea before, Make it so that instead of being able to just buy the weapons, make it so you have to buy 2-3 pieces of the gear first, that will make 'scrub' players actually care about arena because now, their points mean something other than just &quot;ooh big shiny weapon&quot;<br />

The question is, why the hell would a hardcore PvP team feel so inclined as to dissolve its own team and reform with a fresh 1500 and parasite point farmers in the team that want to be powerlevelled to 1900 ratings? *If these guys are as hardcore as they make themselves out to be, the sheer amount of pride they'd take in their rating, gear, and overall elite status would make this unthinkable, since it's these people who were upset about people point farming Arena for gear in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, Sylvanas did not possess an Elven Ranger. *Nowhere did it ever state that. *WCIII created Banshees and Sylvanas' death provided the proper backstory for explaining the creation of Banshees in general, much the same way as Arthas' corruption provided the gist of the backstory for the creation of Death Knights in general. *<br />
Frozen Throne's storyline explained that Sylvanas regained control over herself after the Lich King's dominion over the Scourge began to wane. *Because Blizzard gave Sylvanas a much more important role in the x-pac, and, subsequently WOW, they ditched the initial Banshee model she had in WCIII, reskinned her original Ranger model with an undead touch, and introduced the Dark Ranger hero unit. *<br />
<br />
Basically, Frozen Throne retconned her from vanilla run-of-the-mill Banshee into the bad-ass queen of the damned that she is today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe for the gold they'd be making off that Arena Point farmer? The dollar/coin goes a LONG way!? Im guessing that would the primary motivation, as they dont have to dissolve their own team, only join a fresh new one, that the point farmer created? I mean, which would most rather take, hours of farming, or just 10 games a week for x amount of gold? <br />
<br />
The side effect of this though is you get 1500 rated teams, with people with A3 gear, who mop the floor in the ratings bracket,much like what we are seeing now, only i think it would be worse. <br />
<br />
I dont know Dusk, i see where you are coming from, in that at least our teams, take some 'pride' in our ratings and team effort. Yet, there are others dont only care about the loot, and getting enchants for said loot, and how do you get said enchants? gold, or farm. <br />
<br />
The thing i don't understand is 'Hardcore pvpers' are already rewarded for their skill by having their gear Months, even Seasons ahead of the competition, thus they have MORE time to 'farm' for their gear the next season. Now, take the average joe, who is not that good at pvp, doesnt have fast reflexes, and you know gets a group of like minded members but their group make up in not optimal, eventually they will get better, but to totally cut them off from their rewards i believe is not fair to them, they will forever be getting beat on by the 'hardcore'. so what? he doesnt deserve gear? Well, i believe the 'hardcore' are in the minority, and average joe is in the majority and if average joe stops playing, then Arena as a whole will take a hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If they're going to create a significant penalty to deter &quot;team-hopping,&quot; it'll affect ALL PvPers, not just point farmers looking to piggyback the 1900 teams. This would essentially leave a complete dissolution/reformation of a team as the only viable alternative. You couldn't pay a bleeding-heart PVPer enough to help out the very bottomfeeders he's against.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT how do we know that the bleeding-heart PVPer WOULDN'T want to make a quick buck?? See, the same people labeling, the 'low rated' teams as &quot;not caring&quot; about their rating, COULD be the same people aiding in low rated team point farming!? <br />
<br />
See how that works dusk, just like &quot;all low rated&quot; rated dont care about their ratings, that could mean that &quot;bleeding heart pvpers&quot; do help the bottom feeders for the right price.<br />
<br />
I agree with what you say tho dusk, im just pointing out that you can also say the same thing about hardcore pvpers as they say about the 'low rated teams'.<br />
<br />
Like i said, we both have teams that actually strive to get better, and we also help out guildies try to get better at pvp, usually at the cost of our own rating. Does that make us bottom feeders? well i know we are not, but to the hardcore, because our rating is only avging 1600s+, we probably are considered 'bottom feeders' yet WE know we are not</div></div><hr />

No self-respecting PvPer would sell himself out for a &quot;quick buck&quot; if it meant having to dissolve his elite team to carry a deadweight player on his back for a minimum of 2-3 weeks. Unless you have absolutely no commitments to the real world (job, family, social life), you can't solo 2v2 from 1500 to a 1900 rating in a week. Hell, if your team is essentially at a one player handicap in general, regarless of size, you won't hit 1900 in a week if penalties for deserting your initial team force you to build a new one from scratch. At some point you WILL hit a glass ceiling where equally skilled players impede your way up the ladder. Handicapping yourself one player will ascertain that you hit that glass ceiling sooner and the very involvement of the player you're trying to power-rate will prevent him from reaching his goal.<br />

It's not worth the hassle, aggravation, gold, or sacrifice of pride/personal integrity.</div></div><hr />

If you are trying to piggyback someone to 1900 in a 2v2, and they have to play 2/10 games, you will loose both of these most likely and therefore 1900 will be a pretty hard feat to accomplish. I know as 1500 (We hover +/- 20 each week) if we loose to a team that is at 1350 or so (which there are many) we loose 18 or so rating... If we win we only get 12. Therefore, they loose 2 games to easy teams and you are down 40 and then win 8 and you are up 100... thats an increase of 60 rating after 10 games. 1900 Will take a long time at that rate.</div></div><hr />

The cost should be based on a percentage of the player's overall earned Arena points and would graduate with the frequency in which that player changes teams. This would mitigate the penalty for low-point players and prevent them from being discouraged to find a more properly suited team. Conversely, it would penalize point farmers significantly for hopping from team to team and penalize high-rated players who would consider power-rating point farmers.</div></div><hr />

But there are people out there that do just that. They lv characters just to sell them, they farm gold and other gear just to sell them, and they will create high rated teams just to be able to do what we are afraid of them doing. That's just how it is in any game where money can be made.</div></div><hr />
