World of Warcraft: Azeroth by the Numbers<br />
Blizzard released a nice infographic today that shares lots of fun WoW stats!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/thumb/infoGnomic.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/infoGnomic.jpg) <br />
<br />
From the rise of Onyxia to the fight for Pandaria, more than 100 million of you across the globe have visited Azeroth since the first realms went live in 2004. We’ve gathered some epic statistics to show what you’ve been up to all this time.<br />
<br />
Curious about the faction breakdown among the 500 million characters you’ve created? Wonder how many instances your fellow adventurers run every day, or which pet is the most popular? Take a look at World of Warcraft’s first official infographic below for some fun and surprising never-before-seen facts about the game.<br />
<br />
We hope everyone enjoys this glimpse at the inner workings of Azeroth—feel free to find and share it on Facebook and Twitter. Thanks for being a part of World of Warcraft’s history, and here’s to new adventures with you in Warlords of Draenor!<br />
<br />

Garrosh Heirlooms and Bonus Rolls<br />
Following up on the Garrosh Heirloom bonus roll information yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3721-Level-90-Boost-Heirlooms-and-Bonus-Rolls-Dampening-Change-Low-Level-BGs-DLC) comes some more bonus roll clarifications:<br />
<br />
<br />
Quivering Blob (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97959-quivering-blob) can be won with a bonus roll, and doesn't take the place of an item you would have won. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428226900054376448))<br />
Nalak, Oondasta, Galleon, and Sha of Anger mounts can be Bonus Rolled. Raid mounts cannot. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428229005221691392))<br />
Reins of the Astral Cloud Serpent aren't (and have never been) Bonus Rollable. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428333691421487105))<br />
Kor'kron Shaman's Treasure (http://www.wowdb.com/items/105751-korkron-shamans-treasure) cannot be bonus rolled. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428229753108058112))<br />
You can bonus roll Siege pets in appropriate difficulties due to community feedback about Quivering Blob. The pet is a separate roll from items, so it doesn't have any impact on winning other loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/428234255269756928))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.2 Hotfixes: January 28<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar<br />
<br />
Immerseus<br />
<br />
Immerseus' Swelling Corruption ability should no longer be incorrectly triggering from Balance Druid's Starfall and the Hunter talent, A Murder of Crows on Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
General Nazgrim<br />
<br />
General Nazgrim should no longer incorrectly be gaining Rage while in Defensive Stance from Balance Druid's Starfall and the Hunter talent, A Murder of Crows.<br />
<br />
Malkorok<br />
<br />
Living Corruption's Languish effect should no longer be incorrectly reapplied to players that were under the effect of a Mage's Alter Time spell on Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Figurine - Khorium Boar should no longer incorrectly summon more than one Khorium Boar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.7 PTR Notes Update - Jan 28<br />
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
For the 2v2 Arena bracket, Dampening is now applied to the match starting at the 5 minute mark (down from 10 minutes).<br />
For 3v3 and 5v5 Arena brackets, there is no change. Dampening will continue to be applied at the 10 minute mark.<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley<br />
<br />
The following NPCs now have more health and deal more damage.<br />
<br />
Alliance: Vanndar Stormpike, Balinda Stonehearth, Stormpike Defenders, Stormpike Bowman, and all Marshals.<br />
Horde: Captain Galvangar, Drek'thar, Frostwolf Guardian, Frostwolf Bowman, and all Warmasters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Random Battleground Balance and Queue Times<br />
We talk about stuff like this from time to time, but it's not quite so simple. For example, queue times are a big issue. Separating players out by item level certainly wouldn't help, and in fact, could make things far worse. Having more equally-matched opponents in your random BG would be nice, but having to wait an hour or longer... not so much.<br />
<br />
That said, we're hoping to make a lot of improvements to Random BG's in Warlords. If we get the opportunity to do something like this, we can look into it.<br />
<br />
Side note since I brought it up: we're also looking into queue times. We have a few ideas for changes we might make, but nothing for certain to share just yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/291711-just-an-idea-for-bgs-item-lvl-requirement/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11422772925?page=1#13))<br />
<br />
PvP Blue Posts<br />
One of my personal goals since I started at Blizzard has been to help improve communication with the PvP community. And, though I know it's technically a different forum, I've been as active as possible on the Arena forums contributing what I can. Many of those concerns extend to BGs and RBGs as well, and if you have a concern here that's PvP-related but not necessarily specific to Battlegrounds, it might be a good idea to check the Arena forums too just in case.<br />
<br />
That said, I completely hear you guys on wanting to see more interaction in the Battlegrounds forums. I do read them regularly already, but I'll make a stronger effort to interact here more often. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/291684-670k-pvp-instance-900k-pve-instances/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11424092904?page=2#35))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
I miss using CC in dungeons and raids. Will this come back in WoD?<br />
Not using CC in dungeons currently is mostly a result of being way stronger than the content is designed for. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422465768588967936))<br />
I have needed 0 CC in MoP dungeons ever. Day 1 they were faceroll. Not saying that's 100% bad but it is true.<br />
You are more experienced/skilled than most. That was not the experience for the majority. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422595645359157249))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
With cross-realm arena it feels like there is still one final barrier: faction. Any plans for cross-faction teaming for real ID?<br />
No plans for that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423191814128943104))<br />
<br />
yeah probably. I blame the 15 min ques between games! why are Horde ques so terrible?<br />
There are more horde queuing. The problem is exacerbated if you opt out of unpopular BGs. Looking into options. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423190461180674048))<br />
<br />
Future<br />
Trying Monk heals on my 90, all proving grounds does is say &quot;you suck&quot; No benefit to me over failing thru LFR<br />
Proving Grounds currently just &quot;tests&quot;, it doesn't &quot;teach&quot;. That's something we hope to change in the future. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422868523665211392))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
'scuse me could you shed some light on a little red dragon named Andrestrasz? Is he a tribute, a memorial, something else...?<br />
I believe that commented earlier that he was a tribute, but wasn't sure. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422920126875185152))<br />
I'd bet $20 it's a homage to someone's 5 yr old named Andre but would have to dig into data to find out for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/418534750022668288))<br />

It's a small small minority that have more than one account, and it's actually not counting ones that have been perma banned (usually meaning mass produced bots) so all of these are merely inactive and therefore have been played at a time.<br />
<br />
You may KNOW many people with multiple accounts because you associate with like minded individuals but for the majority 100million is a mere round up of the likely 99million accounts that have been made by one person.<br />
<br />
It's not a lie, it'd be a lie if they said they have 100million people PLAYING for sure.</div></div><hr />

I used stuns or silences here and there to help with the healers or to get mobs to group better for AoE, but hard CC being needed for the majority from expansion launch is really odd to hear especially with the players who complained about Cata heroics having CC to MoP heroics not having CC.<br />
<br />
In ether case if WoD heroics are pointing to Vortex Pinicle for difficulty then I expect some CC and LoS. Actually I think it was among the few that had LoS pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree. Ahahahahaha. This is gold. All MoP dungeons were faceroll day 1 and they know it. &quot;You were a more skilled player&quot;? So every random group in LFD was composed of 1 skilled player (me by the sound of the statement, dps btw) who carried the entire group? Really, that's what your going with? Good to know were all that skilled at this game. LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the information about those mounts actually true? I know several people who claim that they won those mounts via bonus roll. Just yesterday someone on my FL said he got Ji-Kun mount via bonus roll. I don't really trust any blizzard employee on things like that tbh...</div></div><hr />

Especially when I have 5 accounts myself over my WoW career, and I know countless others with 3 or more.<br />
<br />
Simplifying maybe, should say accounts not players.<br />
<br />
I have had 3-4 accounts in my time, it's not uncommon for long term players to have more than one but what you're not looking at is the vast number of more casual players who would only have one. I bet the real number is not so far off.<br />
<br />
Also bear in mind a lot of people share their accounts with others (despite it being against the TOC) so that actually skews the true number of unique players higher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
P.S. Wooooo pet battles, number 1 content in the game! More pet battles each day than PVE and PVP combined! More than double! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Simplifying maybe, should say accounts not players.<br />
<br />
I have had 3-4 accounts in my time, it's not uncommon for long term players to have more than one but what you're not looking at is the vast number of more casual players who would only have one. I bet the real number is not so far off.<br />
<br />
Also bear in mind a lot of people share their accounts with others (despite it being against the TOC) so that actually skews the true number of unique players higher.<br />
<br />
The number they got could only be reached with the trail accounts.<br />
<br />
Also betting the &quot;rarest mount&quot; doesn't include discontented mounts.</div></div><hr />

I know several people who claim that they won those mounts via bonus roll. Just yesterday someone on my FL said he got Ji-Kun mount via bonus roll. I don't really trust any blizzard employee on things like that tbh...<br />
<br />
You shouldn't trust them. There was 0% chance of the mount dropping from Galleon. It was obvious Blizzard forgot to turn on the drop chance. There was a HUGE thread on both the EU and US forums about it. Showing that there was not one person in all the population that had the mount on the armory. People demanded to know what the hell was going on. Why millions of people were wasting bonus rolls on the world boss mounts for MONTHS. Instead of responding, and admitting they made a mistake they closed the threads and a hotfix went out the next week. Then whattya know, tons of people start getting world boss mounts.<br />
<br />
Of course fanboys claimed it was just a coincidence. Always blindly devoted to mother Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Good to know were all that skilled at this game. LOL.<br />
<br />
MoP dungeons and heroics are a joke, no need to be bulls*itting people about it Blizz. In terms of difficulty this whole game became sort of a joke (not talking about Heroic raiding). I guess Blizz has only two modes: &quot;balls-to-the-wall hard&quot; and &quot;easy-peasy&quot; they make heroic raids quite hard and enjoyable but dungeons are designed for braindead monkeys with no opposable thumbs. Half of these skills that they design are of no use to the average player to be honest, you simply have to nuke the shit out of everything until it falls to the ground, that's the principle Blizzard is going with nowadays I suppose.</div></div><hr />

I think, under CCs he means (aoe)stuns, interrupts. Not presheep etc. MoP dungeons are faceroll, no question about it.</div></div><hr />

I remember making liberal use of remorseless winter on my DK back then, but definitely no pre-pull CC like poly or sap. I guess that sort of counts<br />
<br />
And warriors used Shockwave... I don't count that as CC when it is basically part of your rotation, especially when it is not even needed. And skills like Remorseless Winter which do not take any thinking :|. But yes, technically we used CC... lol.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. I am not overly skilled, I am a casual (very) casual player, and no matter which instance or raid I've done in MoP I've -never- used CC or seen it being used, even on fights which are meant for it.</div></div><hr />

WTF is he smoking. Who used CC in MoP dungeons? Unless he misread and meant challenge modes and even then there is a lot of brute forcing with the use of interrupts and short term stuns, but that doesnt match with the previous statement of saying he outgeared the content.<br />

However the 504 unique mounts is not jiving for me. Guildox only lists 409 mounts which includes all the gladiators and original unarmored mounts and everything. All it doesn't list is class mounts which adds up to i believe 14 unique mounts? Thus does that mean they are counting all the never implemented re-skins they've had on file over the years? Because that is just plain dirty. Not to mention that means some 80 reskins that never made it in? I can only think of about 30-40. Huh.</div></div><hr />

is the default titles when you create a new alt...I had the jenkins title for long time on my alt until I enabled to see titles in names and said &quot;wtf&quot;? and changed it immediately. Also I think that is the only titles you can have until you reach a certain level (60+).</div></div><hr />

Yes if your healer was afk or not paying attention (watching tv) which has absolutely nothing to do with experience or skill :P.<br />

Blizzard apparently thinks following your group, selecting a character and pressing two keys without having to pay too much attention to it requires experience or skill. :D</div></div><hr />

Thanks for sharing my opinion, but I have to say, I don't share yours. I mean.. you are leaning toward the opposite end of extreme in terms of processing and translating their numbers. Just because out of 10 people who played 5-10 years only 1 is playing actively still, it doesn't mean that those 9 people opinion is that this game doesn't worth its price.<br />
<br />
I for one played since 2005, played casually at the start and ended up playing on the most hardcore levels of the PvE side of the game. I quit ~2 years ago.. because of life changes, interest changes and so on.<br />
<br />
MoP haven't had any effect on me to renew my sub, but Warlords of Draenor might have, but who knows... I was in my 20s when I started playing, I am past 30 now and I cannot predict if and for how long WoD might keep my interest again.<br />
<br />
I am just saying I don't hate WoW, not saying its not worth the price... quite the opposite, otherwise how could i been playing it for 7 years? :)<br />
<br />
On the other hand I was never the fan of Blizzard's Community Manager's communication style. They like to talk about nothing for pages long. Explaining a very simple thing in pages long that people might think its a big thing or whatever.<br />
I know its a way to keep up the hype and interest, but they are are just not very informative, they losing in meaningless details, twisting out things and words and sentences to make their agenda sound better and so on.<br />
That is what I was pointing at with my previous post.</div></div><hr />

I can understand people asking in LFR, (heart of fear for example had a boss fight where cc was key), but not the regular 5 mans. They are very very easy on normal or *heroic. I think the worst part isnt the ease but they arent engaging at all, we ran 5 mans tons during wrath, and it got tiresome but in MOP the 5 mans just plan suck, you run them a couple times and they are so mind numbingly boring you never want to go back.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHA, bu**sh*t!<br />
<br />
Reality: &quot;Try to not lose 5 million old players in the next quarter and hope the new 1 million players will be us before the next Exp. (WoD)&quot;<br />
Remember: after ICC WoW losing 140k subs/month<br />
NUMBERS don't give those to the PR managers! Burn them with FIRE!</div></div><hr />

The ones about titles are meaningless because they are the default titles your alts get. The 100M is meaningless because it includes trial accounts.<br />
<br />
the most interesting one for me is the # of pet battles. Is there any doubt why Garrisons are going to be the big feature of the next expansion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many 10 year old games have retained 7% of all players who have ever purchased/made an account after that amount of time with a monthly subscription cost?<br />
<br />
I have no facts to back it up, but I would make an educated guess that the answer is &quot;one&quot;. World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alltat</div><div class="date">2014-01-29, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if they count Battle.net accounts that have tried WoW or just WoW accounts. I missclicked in account management once and accidentally added a trial account to my already active WoW account. It still shows up as a separate game on my B.net account.<br />

<br />
100 Million &quot;players&quot; (bullshit detector is going nuts) with ~7 million active is a horrible retention rate.<br />
Over almost ten years, it's pretty good. That 7% of all people who tried the demo would still be playing is a great figure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to give you perspective, look at a website like Skyrim Nexus where even the top rated mods only have about 1 or 2% of the downloaders actually endorsing them. Seems like the same concept. 7% is a good number.</div></div><hr />

I have a hard time believing that too. I saw 3 people having the serpent in my server while I saw the Qiraji only once.</div></div><hr />

It is okay if you do not know every country what belongs to EU, afterall most European couldn't tell each and every states of the US.. but thinking UK == EU is kinda harsh...</div></div><hr />

I think they made this one up so they could have a new and nice looking mount there. The Sha serpent is a nice mount which represents the current expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I found that number to be pretty funny too. Blizzard counts all those bots and gold spammers as &quot;players&quot; I guess. A fine example of false advertising here.</div></div><hr />

pretty sure they only use obtainable mounts. showing an un-obtainable mount is poor marketing</div></div><hr />
