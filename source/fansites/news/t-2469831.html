Well they haven't talked much about the Art and from what I've seen here arounds, that's the only thing people seem to really like - and it's always worth talking about something positive once in a while.<br />
<br />
I'm still unhappy with how awful the new Nightborne models look compared to the NPC versions, but overall I do agree that the art is still up there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like hearing about the art side more than the Dev side. I also don't have an active sub and won't until the Blizzard Access service comes out providing access to all their games including wow for like 20$ a month, which will happen or they will be crushed by Game Pass and EA Access which provide far more bang for your buck and Bobby is all about games as a service. WoW holds very little value anymore on it's own at 15$ a month and they know it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and if you want to actually keep your progress and not start the entire expansion over, it'll be another $25 for that race change.<br />
<br />
Weird, almost like this was entirely planned to milk as much money as possible from us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cause the same dude whose been looking at scaley ass meshes for the past 6 months totally wears the numbers hat.<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually quite liked this stream. I just wish they could've taken some questions though, but still.<br />
<br />
The problem is people asking anything was either about Vulpera (which, ultimately, is fine for an art team) or anything that is tied to the fundamental mechanisms in the game that's hot garbage. <br />
<br />
I would have loved to asked how the Vulpera and the PC creation system affected how they look at future non-playable race design going forward.</div></div><hr />

Yet you continue to come on MMO-champion forums to complain about it and let everyone know you quit.</div></div><hr />

Is there something wrong with that? MMO-Champ has two different types of wow users. <br />
<br />
1. The people who quit and let it be known with their criticism <br />
2. The people who are subbed and have gaping assholes for Activision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Patches in US are released on Tuesdays, in EU on Wednesdays and if I remember correctly China gets them on Thursdays. That's why they say the week of 12th because in different regions patches are on different days. Just look up in the callendar, find 12th. Patch will be this week the reset day, whenever that is depending on your region(12th for US, 13th for EU, 14th for China). So to answer your question it will be on 12th or after depending on the region.</div></div><hr />

Keep going. Nothing is so constructive as being bitter about something you don't like, and can choose not to do/spend time on. Lingering here spreading bile is the way to go!</div></div><hr />

I personally love the community more than WoW at this point, it is why I filtered out anything WoW related from the forum posts lol.</div></div><hr />

If you're bored of it stop playing it. It's meant to entertain you but you can't expect it to forever 24/7. It's like going to a Katy Perry concert, super fun time but if you did it every night for years you'll start to hate Katy Perry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Misuteri</div><div class="date">2019-03-01, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the most under appreciated things in WoW is the sound design/effects.<br />
<br />
For example, Prayer of Mending is so cool that I found a sample of it to use when I receive text messages.<br />
<br />
How many players in PVP hate hearing their character getting that distinctive Cheap Shot from a rogue? We all know the whoosh of a chaos bolt. The sound effects from Loque’Nahak are so distinctive that I sought out the pet just to hear it when I play.<br />
<br />
The zone design and instances has always been top notch. Give credit where it’s due; art and sound have never been wanting IMHO in this game.</div></div><hr />
