Patch 4.1 adds a very useful feature to the game, anything you target will now have its position displayed on the minimap! It's obviously very useful when you're looking for a NPC after using the /target command and I'm sure it will make a couple of rare elite hunters happy. (Unless you have NPCScan, in this case you're probably already happy)

Weekly Daily Quest Cap on PTRs<br />
The change to the daily quest cap I mentioned yesterday is now available for testing on PTRs! For the few people who do not trust file changes for that kind of stuff, here is a nice screenshot of the new LFD Panel with the updated text + the new options. <br />
<br />
Unless a blue poster says something about it, you can probably expect this change to go live and grinding dungeons might get considerably easier for some of you. <br />

Blizzard promised me a pony! (and a raid in 4.1 at Blizzcon)<br />
BlizzCon is a behind the scenes look into the development process. We offer that behind the scenes look because we know people enjoy being able to see our processes, and also hear about what we're thinking about and planning. That comes with the hope that the information is indeed taken as we intend it, which is a candid look at our thoughts and processes. Not bullet points of finalized game features.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately those candid thoughts and processes are sometimes interpreted as promises for the development of our games.<br />
<br />
The reason we commonly do not discuss our plans until they're in the process of being implemented, or actually complete, is exactly for that reason. BlizzCon is a huge exception to our rule, and while we're not going to stop having BlizzCons and offering those behind the scenes looks for those in attendance who come to see exactly those things, it's really unfortunate to see when they're referenced as promises.

The death of World PvP<br />
Hrm, I reckon it's rewards that ruined world PvP. Everyone harkens back to TM/SS as the holy grail of world PvP, and that was before and maybe slightly after the honor system was implemented (but before real rewards existed from it). I think you can encourage world PvP all you want, and if there aren't rewards behind it you'll keep people interested for about as long as it takes them to realize there are other things to do that give real power increases. Why would anyone spend any amount of time just pushing back and forth for no reason when you can spend your time toward actual rewards and character improvement? Maybe there are some of you, but I guarantee it'd be short lived.<br />
<br />
I mean shoot, you have Isle of Quel'Danas or even quest hubs in Cataclysm where people are literally forced together, and there's complaints that they just want people to stop PvPing so they can get their stuff done so they can get their rewards. That's kind of unfair because I know many did enjoy those situations, but somehow it never meets the awesomeness of TM/SS, and I reckon it just never could again.<br />
<br />
The best I can think that you could do is create a specific world PvP zone where you don't allow flying mounts, give some objective to tug-o-war over, and so you can justify giving some semi-meaningful rewards and keep people interested you'd need to find some way to even up the sides (because world PvP is inherently going to be unfair). I think you do all that and you probably have the best working solution for bringing back world PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164472/high-level-guards-ruin-world-pvp))<br />

Hey, here's a PvP objective in the middle of the zone. If you take it, you get stuff. Instead of worthless Honor Hold tokens, make a world PvP currency that you can use to buy real gear. Put in a few more towns that can be held by either the Alliance or Horde. Southern Barrens would be a great place for one. Hell, most contested zones should have one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Is the dungeon finder change just for heroics? I'd like to see the change for normal dungeons too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of this tier&quot; is the generic text on the Random Dungeon page, refering to the 'tier' of dungeon you're randoming, and completely unrelated to the raid based Tier progression. Edit: I should clarify, to be certain my point isn't mistaken - the words 'of this tier' are included because there are already three tiers of Dungeon on the PTR. Whether or not Blizzard decides to alter the rewards from any given 'tier' of dungeon is entirely unrelated to this change in the dungeon finder.<br />
<br />
<br />
The three 'tiers' of Dungeon active on the 4.1 PTR are:<br />
<br />
Random Cataclysm Dungeon - 140 JP and 62g (or similar XP values for under-85 characters, I'd assume)<br />
Random Cataclysm Heroic - 70 VP and 83g<br />
Random Rise of the Zandalari Heroic - 140 VP and 83g<br />
<br />
So, yes, regular dungeons are included.</div></div><hr />

if u made it that every kill of another player gained u like 100-200honour, if done alone, and shared if done with a group it would be ALOT popular. atm u kill somone and get pretty much no reward so there is no point. but with high honour available it would be more then worth it.</div></div><hr />

yeah and there you have 1000 exploiters hiding somewhere in ashevale killing them 10000 times after the pvp bonus is gone <br />

<br />
The problem with that is that once someone is honor capped there's no real point. Offer achievements, temporary titles, stuff like that, and imo it will be more successful than just currency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree! The Outlands concept of World PvP which continued what we saw in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands should be brought back in Cata. Halaa was simply epic; we need that kind of world PvP in Cataclysm, which is supposed to be all about a war between Horde and Alliance.<br />

That target on minimap thing is going to suck for stealth classes; when people are magically still targeting you even after vanishing and running 40 yards away.<br />

I'd anticipate it wouldn't display you on the minimap as soon as you go invisible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here is the problem with that. Servers are not balanced. Horde on let's say Illidan probably outnumber alliance 20 to 1. That is why Blizzard has steered away from those type of PVP situations. It's also why they make Tol barad an even number of people on each team so that lesser population on a faction have a chance equal to the others.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I've seen is world ganking and in general, on pvp servers, people are actually NOT looking for challenge, they jump on you if the overgear you by 3000 miles or outlevel you by 2000. This or they play a lolclass (see mage atm or DK). The only real world pvp I did was back then at lvl59 DK against other DKs at the start of WotLK in Hellfire Penninsula.<br />
<br />
But, if HL world pvp is dead, it's still possible to have fun at low level. For exemple, I created a lvl1 hunter haste twink (78% haste) and around 400 life buffed with 15 resilience (48% reduction damage @ lvl1) and spend my week ends pvp flaged (pve server) in Azshara as alliance, killing quest npc and stuff. In general goblin fotm rerollers (mage) decked in BoA just attack me as they overlevel me by miles and expect me to be a quick kill and flag themselves. I then proceed and have fun killing them. <br />
<br />
World pvp is still around but you need to trigger it.</div></div><hr />

Been waiting for a change like this, something like the Warhammer Online thing where you get an arrow underneath your character that points to the thing you targetted.

7 ? Nice job Blizzard. I have to play and play and play<br />
It is possible that you enter the same rnd dungeon an Monday and on Tuesday. Will that be changed then ? Hope so...<br />
After one week of let´s say playiny 6 rnd dungeons will that vanish on day 7 without getting any valor points ? <br />
<br />
When you have a life and can only play in the evenings 3 days a week you will never be get Valor Points from rnd dungeons.<br />

I think he was referring to the guy who wanted to bring world PvP back by giving 200 honor points when you kill an opposite faction player somewhere in the world.<br />
<br />
This Guy:<br />
<br />
SOLUTION TO WORLD PVP....<br />
if u made it that every kill of another player gained u like 100-200honour, if done alone, and shared if done with a group it would be ALOT popular. atm u kill somone and get pretty much no reward so there is no point. but with high honour available it would be more then worth it.<br />
And yes, that would be overpowered. Like Uselessrogue stated above, there would be a huge amount of exploiters who would just farm the honor with friends or such. You could easily cap the honor points in less than 5minutes if done near a GY. And now that we are available to buy stuff like Elementium ore and Savage leather for honor points, I really don't want to even think what would happen to those &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

7 ? Nice job Blizzard. I have to play and play and play<br />
It is possible that you enter the same rnd dungeon an Monday and on Tuesday. Will that be changed then ? Hope so...<br />
After one week of let´s say playiny 6 rnd dungeons will that vanish on day 7 without getting any valor points ? <br />
<br />
When you have a life and can only play in the evenings 3 days a week you will never be get Valor Points from rnd dungeons.<br />

<br />
7 randoms for 7 times 70 valor points<br />
Its really nothing more than &quot;7 Per Week Instead of 1 Per Day&quot;.<br />
ITS A GOOD CHANGE FOR PEOPLE WITH A LIFE. It means you can get the same rewards for playing 3 days a week and doing 7 dungeons, or playing 7 days a week and doing 7 dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World pvp was great, but occasionally it crashed servers and Blizzard literally tried to kill it off. First they removed Honor kills from guards, which is fine. Then they implemented -honor points (dishonorable Kills) for killing guards, effectively halving the amount of open world pvp and then they implemented BG's and gave it more honor than outdoors pvp. Blizzard killed outdoor pvp and now they're going &quot;Oh gosh, we never saw that coming&quot;. Screw you Blizzard. I'm happy I left for Rift.<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention they also upped the amount of guards that spawned in towns at the same time with the dishonorable kills, so you could never get more +points than -points.</div></div><hr />

And in my opinion, they're just not as fun. Rewards don't make those canned pvp zones &quot;fun&quot; either (it just makes it a different grind if you need those items), so I don't really see the point in comparing the two. Okay, fine, maybe world pvp wasn't the most &quot;balanced&quot; but it never really seemed like they promoted making it more viable, either.<br />
<br />
At this point though it really is doubtful world pvp or anything like it will be back. I'd be surprised if a quest hub like Isle of Quel'Danas is implemented again, since people would just bitch endlessly about it.<br />
<br />
In my opinion and experience, this is the problem: canned rewarded items that are the same for everyone don't make for as much fun as unique experiences such as when you tell your friend, &quot;....and I was taking on five mobs and a rogue came out of nowhere, tried to gank me, but I killed him!&quot; Those are the kinds of things that make games fun, in my opinion. Unfortunately, WoW has less and less of those unique experiences... so, maybe I'm just playing the wrong game. I've really deviated topic :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It relieves the stress off the players who want the maximum amount of valorpoints each week, while perhaps not clearing all current content yet and as such, still 'need' the points from the daily dungeon.<br />
<br />
Can you actually clear current content and not need the daily dungeons? Does anyone know if heroic raids yield more points then kills on normal?<br />
<br />
currently there are 14 killable bosses, of which 1 only on heroic, so lets say, 13 (yes i included Tol Barads' lootpinata), thats in the worst case, 13x70=910 thats still 340 shy off the weekly maximum, thats 5 dungeons, so instead of actually being online 5 days, and getting the time to do them, you could just do it in the weekend or on non-raiding days.<br />
<br />
For 25mans its even easier, 13x90=1170 thats only 80 shy of the weekly maximum, so only needing to actually do 2 (which the last one will overcap you by 60).</div></div><hr />

No, you misunderstood the new system. It doesn't say &quot; the first seven bla bla bla will earn you 490 valor points&quot;, but just 70 valor points. So, you'll only get 70 points/week instead of the currently 490.</div></div><hr />

hä? In the Rnd HC UI there is clearly stated &quot;the first seven heroics you complete each weak will earn you 70 VP&quot; There ist the phrase &quot;70VP each hc&quot; missing. So you can get a total of 490 a weak as it is now, but you can do those 7 random hcs in one go and whenever you want.<br />

On that same topic, I think they should introduce some sort of reward for downing each others city leaders, nothing much, but maybe like a 5% xp bonus similar to WG since the tension has been way higher in cata.

<br />
If you can that means you can now get 7x70 + 7xZA/ZG as they are a seperate tier. I only went on PTR once and i cant find the post here which stated the VP reward but i think its 140 VP for a daily ZA/ZG instance. <br />
<br />
Potential total for non raid VP could be as high as 1470 a week now and in only 1 day with 14 runs :) It seems clear if that is the case that Bliz really wants people to get their valor gear before 4.2 to prevent the likely whining from people who still have poor gear levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it could be through a series of weekly quest chains that would award you 70 VP for each chain you complete. Time invested should be around 30 min max I guess, on each chain. Price money shoukld be 90-120 gold or something. The same you get from completing a dungeon.<br />
<br />
They could also just mix it all up, and make a weekly quest that if you kill this or this leader of the enemy faction you gain 70 valor points. They could also make quests that says if you hold this position under your factions control for 15 minutes you will gain 70 valor points. A position beeing a village or something in a contested area. This could also help the world PvP scene, as yopu would get a lot more people involed. Problem is that most of these PvP options wouldn't really work on non-PvP realms. Still I feel like they should offer more possibilities of earning those 490 valor points each week. If nothing else, then to mix it up a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another majorly forgotten issue on Bashiok's part, something Blizzard has been trying to craft while at the same time destroying it from the inside: COMMUNITY. World PvP requires a community. There is no Horde or Alliance anymore, it's just masses. There is no server anymore, it's just masses.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, you constantly attempt to make new tools with which to allow players to get together. To bring us all together in one big happy family. That is great on you for the most part! Those tools can be useful. The problem is that your game no longer encourages players to actually get together and be a community. It's a game full of community tools with no need for a community.<br />
<br />
I could elaborate but I won't because it would turn into a giant list. I'll just repeat it. WoW is a game full of community tools with no need for a community.</div></div><hr />

There should be no problem at all now with catching up with the latest tier, and is excellent for people with alts.<br />
<br />
490 Valor Points a week for Random Heroic + 980 Valor Points a week for the new ZA/ZG if you run it once a day ( Although I am not certain on that fact, but it seems that's what it is ) Thats a total of 1470 Valor Points a week. Which is great if you need that gear badly.<br />
<br />
Its clearly intended by Blizzard so that when next raid content rolls around, most people will be geared up to at least try it. And if you don't raid, then the PVP rewards are there for you. Good change imo.</div></div><hr />

You never did world PVP at TM/SS for rewards, you did it to kill the opposing faction yet as I said, people just can't be arsed and don't see the game as alliance vs horde anymore so when 1 attacks the other's major cities the reaction is who cares.<br />
<br />
World PVP was always here, you can do it at Halaa, you can do it in any major city if you're brave enough and you also have WG/TB to do it in, yet people just can't be arsed, don't blame Blizzard, blame yourselves.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rozaparks</div><div class="date">2011-03-18, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naoto is somewhat true. Pre-BC the rewards were nearly non-existant for World PvP. You had to take initiative and find or create your own World PvP. You didn't just step outside the gates of SW and *poof* there it was, waiting for you. The truth was that you either had to stir up enough commotion to lure 60's out, visit hotspots like Felwood and BRM, and/or directly attack a city.<br />
<br />
It is true that Blizzard has implemented things in this game that has made World PvP less popular. There are multiple reasons, but they have already been brought to light. All this means is that World PvP is harder to come by. You will just have to try harder to create or engage in World PvP. If you truly enjoy World PvP, then you will be the kind of person that goes to any length to get a kill and get the commotion stirring. <br />
<br />
What it boils down to is Blizzards repeated effort to separate PvP - PvE. If you're on a PvP server, then you are playing in an environment where PvP and PvE are likely to collide and engage each other. Creating, &quot;PvP specific zones&quot; is not a solution. What you're doing is creating an environment where only the people that are ready and willing to pvp are participating. Yes it's good and, &quot;honorable&quot; (dumb word) to fight people that are ready for attacks, but those people that are willing, able, and ready to accept death as a risk of PvP are slim. You need to have the option to kill the person questing, gathering, and/or farming. World PvP is random PvP at its best. You don't know what you're going to get. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard doesn't want to encourage World PvP and take steps towards fixing the real issue with it, then they need to change PvP servers to PvE servers. If the only distinguishing trait between PvP and PvE servers is that you are instantly flagged involuntarily on a PvP server (which no one cares to take advantage of or participate it) then that's very lame.</div></div><hr />

Tauren Mill - Southshore They were two opposing towns in Hillsbred that were close together. For some reason, they became the ´default´place to pvp. There was no objective other than to invade the other town. Most of the fighting happened in the middle. Usually it was lvl 60s fighting in a lvl 30 zone, which was annoying to a lot of people who were trying to quest through the zone, because either you were getting ganked by high level characters, or else your quest givers and flightmasters were dead.<br />
<br />
Like many things in WOW, it is greatly romanticizes now ( ie. rose tinted glasses) after it was removed. The thing is, it never really was removed, what happened is Blizz added battlegrounds and ways to actually gain gear by pvping, so people stopped going to TM-SS..</div></div><hr />

Well, I do raid, and honestly it's really the only thing worth doing in the game currently. I wasn't thinking so much about myself as the general wow player. At this point in time I don't care about valor points, but I have alts and I must admit that I don't really feel like grinding dungeons just for valor points. It is a retarded system. I have no problem grinding dungeons for the gear that the bosses in there can drop, but the fact that you need to complete an entire dungeon, where you can't use any of the gear that actuelly drops in there is just stupid. It's a tedious grind.<br />
And the fact remains, if you wanna stay on top once a new tier of raid emerges, you will have to do that grind, where you kill 4 dungeon bosses only to get the 70 valor points it drops in the end. I just feel like there should be other ways to get those points.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't thinking so much about myself as the general wow player. At this point in time I don't care about valor points, but I have alts and I must admit that I don't really feel like grinding dungeons just for valor points. It is a retarded system. I have no problem grinding dungeons for the gear that the bosses in there can drop, but the fact that you need to complete an entire dungeon, where you can't use any of the gear that actuelly drops in there is just stupid. It's a tedious grind.<br />
And the fact remains, if you wanna stay on top once a new tier of raid emerges, you will have to do that grind, where you kill 4 dungeon bosses only to get the 70 valor points it drops in the end. I just feel like there should be other ways to get those points.<br />
<br />
Find like minded peeps and QQ A LOT on the official forums. Maybe Blizz will just start giving VPs for every critter we kill... But wait OMFG that's a grind too!!! <br />
<br />
Just ask Blizz to mail every char 490VPs each week.<br />
<br />
C'mon people. Everybody wants everything but no one wants to do a fucking thing to get them aside loitering in SW or Ogrimmar. Soon even that will be considered a grind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I first heard about it it I assumed that you could &quot;bank&quot; 1 random per day, so that if you only played on weekends you could still do just as many randoms to get the same VP. However reading it, it looks like you get all 7 per week right up front? If that's so, outcomes I am imagining are:<br />
<br />
1) Tues/Wed LFD is packed as people burn through all their 7 dungeons ASAP.<br />
2) Near the end of the week, there is no one left in the queue. On top of that the majority of the &quot;good&quot; players (who tend to play much more frequently, yes there are good players who only hit weekends, etc, but you would assume they would be in smaller number to the ones that play nearly daily) are already done. So when you finally do get a group its with those guys who only play 2 hours a week and so are not as.... experienced at the dungeons.<br />
<br />
I really hope this just lets you bank the days so by the following Monday you can still run 7 randoms if you didn't do any... but this looks more like I can run all 7 at the START of the week...</div></div><hr />

Fucking mystical mass spawning guards in cities than can shoot through walls that hit like trucks when there is a few of them on you. A few elite guards with loads of hp in cities? I can take. The fact that you are out numbered by the opposite faction, i can take (its part of the fun), the fact that the guards just casually spawn wherever really pisses me off.<br />
<br />
What are they really there for? To stop people killing npcs that basicly spawn back in 5 seconds anyway? Griefing UNFLAGGED enemies? On pvp servers players should be flagged regardless of where they are, maybe max level only but it would be nice to be able to attack people instead of them just standing around lolling at you while you get rattled by 20 guards that just spawned on you.<br />
<br />
Another thing, move the graveyard closer to the cities even for enemy players. The horde one for Stormwind is the lumber camp nearly a zone away, takes years to get back, just to get killed by guards making your battles even more unfair.

<br />
What can you possibly think it's about? It's about the tiny-barely noticeable graphical changes they've implemented into the game. It's not like it's going to make the game relevant graphically due to it being running on an engine that was probably designed 7+ years ago. It's still going to look incredibly and laughably out-dated. The game needs a massive engine overhaul, and it's not going to get it anytime soon. Besides, blizzard's known that their graphical prowess is incredibly weak compared to other AAA-devs, usually it's the merit of their gameplay and content that keeps them afloat.</div></div><hr />

There is an easier way of getting them for alts. Once the next tier is released and all of the current VP items are purchasable in a fraction of the time with JPs. <br />
<br />
But for whoever wants several chars with the top gear right now or at any given moment, then that requires the appropriate effort and time.</div></div><hr />

Tauren Mill - Southshore They were two opposing towns in Hillsbred that were close together. For some reason, they became the ´default´place to pvp. There was no objective other than to invade the other town. Most of the fighting happened in the middle. Usually it was lvl 60s fighting in a lvl 30 zone, which was annoying to a lot of people who were trying to quest through the zone, because either you were getting ganked by high level characters, or else your quest givers and flightmasters were dead.<br />
<br />
Like many things in WOW, it is greatly romanticizes now ( ie. rose tinted glasses) after it was removed. The thing is, it never really was removed, what happened is Blizz added battlegrounds and ways to actually gain gear by pvping, so people stopped going to TM-SS..<br />

<br />
First, what is world pvp? <br />
I see it either, or even both as:<br />
1. PvP outside an instance<br />
2. PvP without objectives.<br />
<br />
The problem with #1 is it can interfere with players who don't want to pvp, and unless you enforce side balance, they almost will never be balanced.<br />
The problem with #2 is that player's don't ever feel it being done, or accomplishing anything at the end of the day.</div></div><hr />

You sure did. Unlike you, there are people who play this game AND have lives. People work and stuff on Tuesdays, so you'll probably see activity dip on Thu and Fri and pick back up on Sat and Sun. Plus, not everyone can run 7 dungeons in one day. That is A LOT of playtime, even if you are geared and get through them relatively quickly.</div></div><hr />

I have to complete 7 random dungens in one week to earn 70 Valor Points ? <br />
7 ? Nice job Blizzard. I have to play and play and play<br />
It is possible that you enter the same rnd dungeon an Monday and on Tuesday. Will that be changed then ? Hope so...<br />
After one week of let´s say playiny 6 rnd dungeons will that vanish on day 7 without getting any valor points ? <br />
<br />
When you have a life and can only play in the evenings 3 days a week you will never be get Valor Points from rnd dungeons.<br />
Perfect for all who can play and play and play. Bullshit for all others. This is not an improvement. <br />
<br />
Blizzard please remove this point crap completly from this game. This was and will always be crap. <br />
To get high level epics from doing daily hero kindergarten is a slap in the face for raiders.<br />
<br />
Well, please re-read because you got it completely wrong. 70 each for the first 7 heroics whether you do them on day 1 of the week or spread out all week. 3 evenings of play could mean 3 toons maxed on valor points from heroics (490) for the entire week if you can get a good group to run them with you.<br />

No, you misunderstood the new system. It doesn't say &quot; the first seven bla bla bla will earn you 490 valor points&quot;, but just 70 valor points. So, you'll only get 70 points/week instead of the currently 490.<br />
<br />
70 for each one of the first 7 = 490. If u don't think the 'each' is implied, log on to the PTR and see for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
70/490 Valor<br />
140/490 Valor<br />
210/490 Valor<br />

As straight up DPS toons, I usually get a heroic queue to pop every 20-30 minutes. Do some dailies or AH during the queue and its really no big deal to get 3-4 done in an evening. Since queues are region wide now, people that say they 'can't', just aren't trying. Sure its faster if you have a healer or tank, but far from impossible as dps.</div></div><hr />

Ha. Ha. Ha.<br />
<br />
You should calm down. Count to 10. It's a game. Go outside. Roll around in the grass.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of people in this thread complaining about world PVP and I'm betting you weren't around for TM/SS. I was! And it was a fucking nightmare unless YOU were the level 60. And even then, as tiers progressed, you were easily outclassed by people who had higher PVE or PVP progression than you. That's right. With no resilience, PVE raiders would also destroy the 2 cities and make life generally unpleasant. From camping bodies by Nesingwary in STV for HOURS to halting all questing in the Hillsbrad zone for even longer, I fail to see how people remember this fondly unless you were constantly with the upperhand. And even then, you know why people went to TM/SS? Because they were bored. They had nothing to do. They didn't raid or pvp so they went there to kill lowbies who had zero chance of retaliation. That, my friends, is your wonderful WORLD PVP! Sounds amazing, huh? Not. It wasn't until the high rated PVPers and PVEers came to the rescue that it turned into huge brawls. <br />
<br />
Same with IQD. What a lovely island. Full of corpse camping, bugged guards, wildly unbalanced classes (sub rogues, arms warriors, resto druids, DEMO LOCKS, eventually ret paladins), and times where one faction would be able to completely lock down all dailies. For people who raid or people who play organized pvp and don't care to world pvp, it was a nightmare sometimes. It was fun when you had the upperhand and in IQD the upper hand shifted more often than the TM/SS battles, but still. <br />
<br />
It is my opinion that classes have become wildly specialized and grandiose and too much so for world PVP. In a setting like Alterac Valley, its alright because you can randomly happen upon people 1v1 or even 2v1 and do well but you still have an objective so it doesn't always become simply a corpse camp party. In world pvp, the objective was always to force the other person to log off. Methinks there are better ways to spend your time instead of ruining another person's day because you are bored. That isn't the objective of the game and never was.</div></div><hr />

in TBC this was possible because of the low-dps-to-health ratios, In wrath (and to a lesser degree cataclysm) the fact that you can die in a matter of seconds means it is nearly impossible to turn the tables on a ganker. That changes was the final nail in the coffin for world PvP for me.</div></div><hr />

Ha. Ha. Ha.<br />

You should calm down. Count to 10. It's a game. Go outside. Roll around in the grass.<br />

I see a lot of people in this thread complaining about world PVP and I'm betting you weren't around for TM/SS. I was! And it was a fucking nightmare unless YOU were the level 60. And even then, as tiers progressed, you were easily outclassed by people who had higher PVE or PVP progression than you. That's right. With no resilience, PVE raiders would also destroy the 2 cities and make life generally unpleasant. From camping bodies by Nesingwary in STV for HOURS to halting all questing in the Hillsbrad zone for even longer, I fail to see how people remember this fondly unless you were constantly with the upperhand. And even then, you know why people went to TM/SS? Because they were bored. They had nothing to do. They didn't raid or pvp so they went there to kill lowbies who had zero chance of retaliation. That, my friends, is your wonderful WORLD PVP! Sounds amazing, huh? Not. It wasn't until the high rated PVPers and PVEers came to the rescue that it turned into huge brawls. <br />
<br />
Same with IQD. What a lovely island. Full of corpse camping, bugged guards, wildly unbalanced classes (sub rogues, arms warriors, resto druids, DEMO LOCKS, eventually ret paladins), and times where one faction would be able to completely lock down all dailies. For people who raid or people who play organized pvp and don't care to world pvp, it was a nightmare sometimes. It was fun when you had the upperhand and in IQD the upper hand shifted more often than the TM/SS battles, but still. <br />
<br />
It is my opinion that classes have become wildly specialized and grandiose and too much so for world PVP. In a setting like Alterac Valley, its alright because you can randomly happen upon people 1v1 or even 2v1 and do well but you still have an objective so it doesn't always become simply a corpse camp party. In world pvp, the objective was always to force the other person to log off. Methinks there are better ways to spend your time instead of ruining another person's day because you are bored. That isn't the objective of the game and never was.<br />
<br />
Simple solution. Reroll to a PvE server. <br />
