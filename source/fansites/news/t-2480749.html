Patch 8.2 PTR - Caverns of Time Portal Added to Stormwind Portal Room<br />
The latest version of the PTR added a Caverns of Time Portal to the Stormwind Portal Room. As of now it is unusable. There is currently not one implemented in the Orgrimmar Portal Room, but they will definitely find a place for it!<br />
<br />

<br />
Clarification on the “Against Overwhelming Odds” Quest Reward<br />
There is currently a display error which is causing some characters that are eligible to receive the “Against Overwhelming Odds” quest to see an incorrect item level listed as the reward. However, the rewards are working as intended. Azerite rewards are now meant to be item level 400 and non-Azerite rewards are now meant to be item level 395. The quest chooses one at random for each character. Thank you for your patience as we work to resolve this issue and have the correct item level displayed.<br />
<br />
As an additional note, when Rise of Azshara releases, this quest will be removed from a character’s quest log if it hasn’t been turned in before it becomes unavailable during a Tuesday morning weekly reset.</div></div><hr />

If you are referring to Naga wearing armor, their model has been able to since vanilla.<br />

It is the reward for completing the Stratholme pet dungeon (It is a pet).<br />
<br />
<br />
It's got one lonely stitch holding his butt cheeks together<br />
<br />
I think that is also a pet you can get from the new pet dungeon currency. The Virmin is too.</div></div><hr />

Even though that's awful that's some how better than yet ANOTHER Twilight Dragon which are insanely and unrealisticly over-present and more numerable than any other dragon flight in the game.</div></div><hr />

Probably patting themselves on the back, and of course there are people commending Blizzard for a job well done and for listening to its playerbase LOL</div></div><hr />
