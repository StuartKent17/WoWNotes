<br />
Also spotted some Hunter changes. I am not sure I am reading it correctly, but it seems they may be giving Survival the [Bear Trap] ability, as a new spell, rather than max level talent, so they too can pick the new [Exotic Munitions] talent. From previous Twitter, it seemed they were considering it as talent. I like it more like this. [Exotic Munitions] sounds very interesting!<br />
<br />
Otherwise I'm a bit saddened that most of this class stuff is just number changes. Here's hoping they'll make up for it with a ton of fun Minor Glyphs soon! :D</div></div><hr />

I'm more interested in Demonbolt. Sounds like it's going to be far more powerful than chaos bolt and might make demonology a little more powerful/easier to get the rotation down for people like me. <br />
<br />
Just wish I already had the talent so I could see how much it does before squish.<br />

Plus the mastery. Could be amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. Even IF they plan to drop the beta in the next couple of weeks to counter Wildstar and the beta is much more complete than previous expansions and the beta test itself will be shorter than previous expansions.. they still have a content issue. I agree with you. I think it's unforgivable. Especially for a game with so many subscribers. It just smacks of &quot;Oh hey.. we'll gladly take your money.. and use it to build other games&quot;. But that's their choice. I suspect they will be shown up pretty soon in the content department and perhaps it will force them to address the situation. But for many players it will come far too late.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoaric</div><div class="date">2014-05-22, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, didn't think of it like that. I brought it up because he was alive in the past, and was still is in our future.<br />
<br />
Yup yup. Here's sorta how it all goes down:<br />
<br />
Garrosh goes back in time, thereby creating an alternate dimension of Draenor 30 years<br />
ago, right before the orcs outside of Gul'dan's can were to drink demon blood. Garrosh<br />
stops the blood drinking idea, convinces them that Azeroth is weak and a better place<br />
to attack, especially with the war machines they can build with his know-how. They <br />
listen, and build the Iron Horde. The Iron Horde then creates the Dark Portal, and sends <br />
shock-troopers through. As soon as these troopers go through the portal, Alternate<br />
Draenor is sort of in it's own pocket dimension connected to our time. The Dark Portal <br />
there is now attached to ours, and ours no longer leads to Outland.</div></div><hr />

So... what's the problem? Can't they do an alternate timeline story because someone else already did it? Future Trunks and Cell should go ahead and sue all of those who did it after them. Shame they'd have those who did it before them all over their asses.</div></div><hr />

Please never read alpha or beta notes again.<br />
<br />
First off, everything is being rescaled all the way to 100. We have a bunch of new stats, a bunch of removed stats and about a million talent changes, all of which will affect DPS charts at 100.<br />
<br />
Next, these alpha notes are comparing to the old alpha notes, which none of us have played. If mages in the old alpha were 500% OP, and they get a 50% nerf in this alpha.. that is nothing. Since we have no idea how they were playing in the last alpha round, either a buff or nerf is meaningless information to us.<br />
<br />
it is just stupid how people read patch notes, then say ´omg, frost mages were mid-pack on SoO, why are we getting a 50% nerf to our main ability in these patch notes´.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Are there rules against releasing stuff at the end of May?<br />
<br />
because you know WOW is so afraid of Wildstar that they are announcing these alpha notes within 2 months of Wildstar release. It should be clear to anyone that WOW had all of this stuff ready back in January, but has held onto it just so they can release these alpha notes 2 weeks before wildstar. Because you know, reading that Mangle now does 180% weapon damage compared to 220% weapon damage is totally going to make me forget about Wildstar.<br />
<br />

<br />
A new alpha build the very same day TESO gets its first major content patch release. Those pure coincidences just keep piling up.<br />
<br />
lol.. really.. so you aren´t going to play TESO today because of the 3 minutes it takes you to read alpha notes?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think TESO released their patch today to counter WildStar..<br />
<br />
it is irrelevant.. TESO is already a dead game that will go F2P as soon as the devs have time to implement it. It really had nothing to do with WOW releasing alpha notes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A pretty quote from Dakeshi regarding these nerfs:<br />
<br />
<br />
Strengths value has increased tremendously per point because of the attack power changes. This is obviously subject to change since alpha is beta is alpha is release is alpha alpha alpha, but currently:<br />
<br />
MoP: Strength gives you 2 attack power, and 14 attack power=1 weapon damage dps.<br />
WoD: Strength gives you 1 attack power, and 3.5 attack power=1 weapon damage dps.<br />
<br />
Before, you got 1 weapon dps for 7 strength, now you get 2 weapon dps for 7 strength.<br />
<br />
If numbers stayed like they are in WoD, abilities would be far stronger than they currently are, hence the &quot;nerfs&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am not saying this is the only reason and this is why abilities are nerfed, i'm saying this is a factor and it seems like people have forgot about this change.</div></div><hr />

The Azeroth Chopper mount mostly. Gives players the impression they still &quot;have&quot; the mount even if certain (or all of) toons of theirs can't ride it. They'll be able to see the in-game model at least, but ideally it would encourage them to give the opposite faction a try.</div></div><hr />

nerfs from what? Stop being stupid, you aren´t playing Alpha so you have no idea what they are nerfing from. Seriously please stop reading alpha patch notes, you have no clue. Unless you are playing alpha you have no idea what is OP at the moment at lvl 100. Therefore it is stupid to cry about nerfs.</div></div><hr />

They won't even have to try either, with the new 50% slow ammo they apply on all attacks. Not that zero CD disengage isn't op enough on it's own.<br />

You go make a new skeleton and animate it with the fluidity that they do with all the cycles they have. Then you can go bitch at them, or just don't play it.</div></div><hr />

Could they please stop recycling 10 year old models?<br />

I agree they could have at least polished the model's shapes a little, to make them less sharp .. and y'know.. from 10 years ago. I like the cosmic theme to it, but it would be so easy for them to just add a few more polygons to the voidwalker model and make some new textures. :/</div></div><hr />

Shoulders could be a scaling issue-- model viewer is notorious for not scaling properly. Lots of weaps that have been scraped so far had a &quot;raw&quot; value so they looked ENORMOUS, but won't look that big when actually equipped in-game. Early scrapes often lack the race-specific info for scaling properly.</div></div><hr />

Yeah! The team that designs the skeletons clearly has nothing to do right now. They don't have a massive project they're working on or anything like that.<br />
Blizzard could come up with 112 new skeletons this expansion and you would call them lazy for not creating 113.</div></div><hr />

The monk class wasn't prominent in orcish history, so it's tricky to find their niche in WoD. That being said, I think modeling the monk set from the Fomor or earth giants isn't ideal, as the earth theme is more the shaman's theme. Since monks are more in tune with wind, their armor should be inspired by the arakkoa...which is likely reserved for the druid set.</div></div><hr />

BC has some of my favourite armor sets across all classes. There was more colour, variety and general feel of special in that expansion than in the following three. It seems that so many people complained about the colour in BC that we all ended up with muted choices in the next few expacs.<br />
<br />
A lot of the WoD armor art released so far (and yes I know it's by no means a complete look) seems to be going back to the &quot;realistic&quot; look of rock, metal and tanned hides. Please don't revert to the beige/grey colour palette. We have transmog now, we can mix and match to fill gaps so we don't look like clowns (the BC complaint). I would love to see more art inspired by the bold colours and styles found in BC, not more of the same &quot;blend in&quot; dullness we have seen in later expacs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously? Shows what little you know about alpha builds….what did you expect a few buildings? They're in the process of building the game client. What you're seeing is the various departments starting to add in their contributions…nothing more and nothing less. You don't think they add all the dialogue a week before they print the gold master do you? You don't think they add the phases until the 2 or 3rd beta build do you? Or the gear or the maps etc etc.<br />
<br />
They obviously have also done a first tuning pass / reintegration of talents but even that is standard operating procedure and the first of many to come.<br />
<br />
And most past betas, which have lasted 4 to 6 months, were essentially complete (which this alpha build isn't) and meant for debugging / tuning passes etc - with the exception of Jade Forest they haven't in the past made significant changes to their betas (i.e. Path of Titans was killed off in pre/early alpha not in beta).<br />
<br />
So while you are seeing a lot of info in this data dump it really tells you very little about the state of the client and you most certainly can't extrapolate or even make a wild guess in regards to what this means in relation to a) a public beta test date, b) the length of that beta and c) release date of the game.<br />
<br />
In fact the very calculated reason you're even seeing all this info is to hide the fact that Blizz is way behind schedule and that the final tier of MoP will likely be the longest in history. They are trying to make you forget all that and tempt you to stay subscribed / pre-order / not play wildstar etc by putting their alpha on public servers knowing it will be data mined. MMO Champion etc are serving as cheap marketing / publicity for them in the process. If they weren't somewhat desperate, because there are potential negatives (i.e. seeing info out of context and cancelling because your favourite character got nerfed / no tier in LFR / over-exposure - no mystery etc), the alpha would be on non public servers and subject to an NDA like all others alphas have been. <br />
<br />
They have obviously fooled a few.</div></div><hr />

Well from what I could tell, there are two different raid armor models. The normal, I'm guessing and the heroic model, as well as a completely different mythic model. If you look at the first warrior tier 17 model, you can notice it is a slightly watered down in detail version of the mythic model. <br />
<br />
So for instance the shaman model, as well as like the rogue, mage, and monk are the normal/heroic models, and there is most likely a 10x more badass version of the mythic model, that we have yet to see. This is all just a hypothesis and I don't know if this is in fact how it's going to work, but the warrior so far has two models, and the pally also has two models.</div></div><hr />

Someone would say, hey it's a monk, it should have pattern. Then why paladins aren't always full plate knights? Same with shamans. I love T6/8/10 but now, especially T16 is not funny for me. I hoped T17 will have some kick ass effects but maybe they saving them for mythic. Hope so.<br />
<br />
About other datamines. Talador map looks pretty, I love almost every Blizz map in-game.<br />
<br />
Gronn model is nice but I liked more old one (same with clefthoof).</div></div><hr />

Rogue is a litte too much steampunk for my taste. Warrior mythic looks like a stag beetle and the other one too generic. The Monk armour, well, I'm a little speechless but not in a good way. The shaman brought his own air conditioner, but looks somehow half-finished.</div></div><hr />

Quit the game if you are this negative about everything. It's a game and should be filled with people who enjoy it.<br />

It seems like they just design everything to look ridiculous and over the top now. It's not good design, nice aesthetic, or even immersive design. Now, it's just about making a weapon the size of your character, or armor with as many spiky things and huge protrusions as possible, so everyone knows you have high-end gear.</div></div><hr />
