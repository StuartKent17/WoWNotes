Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Warrior—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Warrior. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Warrior in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.<br />
<br />
Warriors are thematically informed by our own history, dating back to ancient clashes when close-quarters, shield-and-sword combat was the backbone of battlefield strategy. Warriors in WoW are steeped in this tradition, with each specialization filling distinct niches.<br />
One notable goal we have for Warriors in Legion is to significantly expand their customizability through talents, especially for Arms and Fury. If the below core abilities seem sparse, it’s to leave room for more from talents than ever before. Both specs now have five rows of core throughput talents (mostly different between Arms and Fury, too), with a strong mix of active rotational abilities, passives, procs, cooldowns, and other interesting effects. You’ll find old favorites like Overpower, Heroic Strike, and Opportunity Strikes, returning classics like Avatar, Dragon Roar, and Storm Bolt, along with a host of brand new talents. We look forward to seeing the combinations that you put together.<br />
<br />
Arms[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Across culture and kingdom, men and women who demonstrate great physical aptitude are transformed into mighty warriors through tests of strength, endurance, and fighting capability. Their friendships are forged not in the classroom, tavern, or workshop, but in the dueling pits and on the arena floor. As a childhood of sparring defines a warrior’s destiny, so too does one’s choice of weapon determine their role on the battlefield. Arms warriors gravitate toward two-handed weapons instinctively. It’s more than a matter of preference—it speaks to the character of the wielder. Arms warriors are patient in a fight, waiting to capitalize on moments when an opponent is left exposed. Two-handed weapons allow them to deliver devastating, overpowering blows, fully exploiting their enemies’ weaknesses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Arms warriors are patient in a fight, waiting to capitalize on moments when an opponent is left exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
The defining character traits of Arms Warriors already mesh well with their gameplay, but there’s room for more flavor. In Legion we’ve opened up a wider variety of potential gameplay styles based on your talent choices, as discussed above. We also replaced their Mastery with Colossal Might, which increases the effectiveness of Colossus Smash, playing into their theme more directly. As before, Arms Warrior Rage generation comes from auto-attacks.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Arms Warriors:<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike<br />
<br />
20 Rage, Melee Range, Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
A vicious strike that deals strong Physical damage and reduces the effectiveness of healing on the target for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slam<br />
<br />
15 Rage, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Slam an opponent, causing moderate Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Colossus Smash<br />
<br />
Melee Range, Instant, 45 sec cooldown<br />
Smashes the enemy’s armor, dealing massive Physical damage, and increasing damage you deal to them by 20% for 6 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Execute<br />
<br />
10 Rage, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Attempt to finish off a foe, causing strong Physical damage to the target, and consuming up to 30 additional Rage to deal up to massive additional damage. Only usable on enemies that have less than 20% health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tactician<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Slam, Whirlwind, and Execute have a 20% chance per target hit to reset the cooldown on Colossus Smash.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Colossal Might<br />
<br />
Increases the damage of your Colossus Smash by 50%, and causes it to increase damage taken by an additional 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Arms-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Titanic Might<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Increases the duration of Colossus Smash by 200%, but halves its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fury[/b][/size][/center]<br />
On the battlefield and in the arena, the most feared combatants are often the furious berserkers who lust for battle and thirst for blood. Through a lifetime of training and sparring, these merciless warriors have become masters of carnage—often wielding a weapon in each hand to maximize the destruction. Even without the protection of a shield, the fury warrior leaves little opportunity for an opponent to strike without suffering grievous wounds in return—delivered in a whirlwind of blades that dooms anyone its wake. Brute force becomes a breathtaking display when fury warriors relentlessly dive into the fray. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brute force becomes a breathtaking display when fury warriors relentlessly dive into the fray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Fury is a thematically grandiose take on the classic warrior archetype, and in Legion we want the gameplay to convey this better. To help deliver on the fantasy of a relentless death-dealer, we’ve bolstered their gameplay around quickly building Rage and then going wild with Rampage. In particular, Enrage is now considerably more powerful, doubling your attack speed (and thus Rage generation, since the majority of Rage is still generated by auto-attacks), along with increasing damage based on Mastery. Similar to Arms, a multitude of talent options will expand your combat abilities in a wide variety of ways.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Fury Warriors:<br />
<br />
Bloodthirst<br />
<br />
Melee Range, Instant, 4.5 sec cooldown<br />
Attack the target in a bloodthirsty craze, dealing moderate Physical damage, generating 10 Rage, and restoring 5% of your health.<br />
Bloodthirst has an additional 40% chance to be a critical strike.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enrage<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Bloodthirst critical strikes or activating Berserker Rage will Enrage you, increasing attack speed by 100% and damage taken by 30% for 6 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raging Blow<br />
<br />
10 Rage, Melee Range, Instant<br />
A mighty blow with both weapons that deals a total of strong Physical damage.<br />
Only usable while Enraged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rampage<br />
<br />
50 Rage, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Unleash a series of 5 brutal strikes over 2 sec for a total of massive Physical damage.<br />
Rampage always deals damage as if you were Enraged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Execute<br />
<br />
30 Rage, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Attempt to finish off a foe, causing a total of massive damage Physical damage. Only usable on enemies that have less than 20% health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Unshackled Fury<br />
<br />
Increases damage done while Enraged by 28% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Fury-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Frenzy<br />
<br />
15 Rage, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Furiously slash at the target, dealing moderate Physical damage, and increasing your Haste by 5% for 10 sec. Stacks up to 5 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Protection[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Like their counterparts, protection warriors are virtually bred for physical dominance, having been raised in the art of close-quarters combat—but their measured approach to battle is what distinguishes them from their comrades-in-arms. They demonstrate an uncanny knack for blade and shield, nullifying an opponent’s advances and creating opportunities for counterattacks. For the protection warrior, being the toughest soldier on the front means nothing if allies are left vulnerable to the enemy’s attack. Stalwart defenders are integral to the success of any military campaign—the protection warrior seeks to be an unbreakable wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the protection warrior, being the toughest soldier on the front means nothing if allies are left vulnerable to the enemy’s attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Protection gameplay ties strongly to Warrior lore and exemplifies the very foundation of the tank role in the game, so we’re primarily focused on fine-tuning their mechanics. Shield Block and Shield Barrier in particular often created a trap choice for players. We’ve replaced Shield Barrier with a new ability, Ignore Pain, which massively reduces damage taken (up to a cap based on maximum health) and functions as your primary defensive Rage-spender. It doesn’t compete as much with Shield Block, and thus provides you with distinct tools in your arsenal to apply to different situations. In terms of Rage, Protection Warriors now primarily generate Rage through taking damage, supplemented by a baseline Rage income from ability usage. This plays well with Ignore Pain as their primary Rage-spender; it’s most useful when you’re taking a lot of damage, which is also when you’ll have a lot of Rage to use on it.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Protection Warriors:<br />
<br />
Offensive<br />
<br />
Devastate<br />
<br />
Melee Range, Instant<br />
A direct strike, dealing moderate Physical damage.<br />
Devastate has a 30% chance to reset the cooldown of Shield Slam.<br />
<br />
<br />
Revenge<br />
<br />
Melee Range, Instant, 9 sec cooldown<br />
Swing in a wide arc, dealing strong damage to all enemies in front of you.<br />
Generates 4 Rage.<br />
Your successful dodges and parries reset the cooldown of Revenge (cannot occur more than once every 3 sec).<br />
<br />
<br />
Deep Wounds<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your Devastate and Revenge cause the target to bleed for strong Physical damage over 15 sec.<br />
This effect is cancelled if the target reaches full health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap<br />
<br />
Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
Blasts all enemies within 8 yards for moderate damage and reduces their movement speed by 50% for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shield Slam<br />
<br />
Melee Range, Instant, 9 sec cooldown<br />
Slam the target with your shield, causing strong Physical damage.<br />
Generates 6 Rage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike<br />
<br />
30 Rage, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Instantly deals moderate Physical damage.<br />
This ability is not on the global cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive<br />
<br />
Shield Block<br />
<br />
10 Rage, Instant, 12 sec recharge, 2 charges<br />
Raise your shield, blocking every melee attack against you for 6 sec. These blocks can be critical blocks.<br />
Shield Slam deals 30% additional damage while Shield Block is active.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ignore Pain<br />
<br />
40 Rage, Instant<br />
Fight through the pain, ignoring 90% of the next massive amount (based on maximum health) of damage you take.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Reflection<br />
<br />
Instant, 25 sec cooldown<br />
Raise your shield, reflecting spells cast on you and reducing magical damage taken by 30%. Lasts 5 sec or until a spell is reflected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Critical Block<br />
<br />
Increases your chance to block by 10% (with Mastery from typical gear) and your chance to critically block by 30% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
Also increases your attack power by 20% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Protection-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Shield Discipline<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Shield Slam extends the duration of Shield Block by 2 sec.<br />
Shield Block increases the damage of Shield Slam by an additional 30%.<br />
<br />

<br />
Rampage always deals damage as if you were enraged, at least. It seems like that is replacing WS as the rage dump, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the flipside though, no mention of Rend so Arms will be fun to play again :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sliske</div><div class="date">2015-11-11, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so the same problems exist then?<br />
<br />
Arms - You suck if you have 1 second of downtime. A rogues energy regens, an eles cooldowns cycle. An arms warrior does nothing. He still has to go back into the fight, auto a few times and THEN start hitting. Why the hell did they write Whirlwind in the mastery, yet don't give us an actual tooltip of Whirlwind. I want to know whether its going to be hitting for 1/50th of my other spells or not. Are we getting what we enjoyed back? Are we getting heroic strike? Is WW going to be useful again? Is execute still going to be our main weakness and strength? Is our entire class going to be held up by whether or not we got a decent set bonus to fill the major, major fucking flaws with the spec? I can't see how this is appealing to anyone. Its a shame, but as of now, I certainly won't be returning to my 9 years main. I probably won't even play at all at this rate. This is some shoddy D- work. Work, might I add, that was already done for them by the thousands of posts of extremely valuable feedback with detailed descriptions of abilities and how they work, their weaknesses and strengths. We literally did it for you Blizzard, we were all there months ago writing it out for you, and you were too lazy to implement it. GG, no re.<br />
<br />
Fury - So apparently its weird that we used zerker stance to take damage to get rage, yet they're fine with giving us a 30% vulnerability permanently? Again with the stupid as fuck double standards. Are they going to address how crippled warrior has become due to talents? Talents were suppose to be roughly paraphrasing &quot;If you want to play more passive, take the passive talents, if you want to be more involved, take the cooldown talents&quot;. Ok. So tell me where that choice is for warrior? No talents and you have a 2 button class. Yet if we take 1 talent from each tree we arrive with an extra 5-6 buttons. Consistency, Blizzard. Even if the idea sucks, be consistent and actually do it. Not only where you not consistent (and still aren't) but your replacement outcome is just as bad.<br />
<br />
I don't play prot, so won't comment on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It &quot;must&quot; be gone, because they will not allow only warriors to use the same artifacts in two specs or simply damage vs tanking. This would cause problems with all tanks and heals!</div></div><hr />

The rest have already been commented on, but I wouldn't bring a fury warrior at all to my raids with their inherent 30% increased damage taken over any other classes now; unless they deal 30% higher dps than #2 on the meters.</div></div><hr />

Most of these changes haven't been super-drastic, and still loads of tuning passes to come before the final Legion %'s come out. Let's not scare Blizz into thinking they can't change anything for fear of a wall of raging, some/most of these changes are improvements for the better.<br />
<br />
Overall these seem fine, my only suggestion would be like others said to remove the 30% increased damage while enraged. Bosses don't take increased damage while enraged, so it feels odd to have a different enrage behavior for players. If it's a balance issue, just cut out the damage portion altogether and make it a simple increases melee speed by x% cd buff.</div></div><hr />

I know that this is just the shell and baseline, but the previews for Arms and Fury don't sound awesome. In particular, I think they missed the mark with Arms when delivering on the class fantasy, as I don't think the current iteration delivers and there were few changes. I don't play Fury but it looks very similar, except for the Rampage ability? <br />
<br />
Aside, I assume the 30% damage taken is some sort of placeholder or flavor debuff that will be rolled back. I think we are beyond the stage in the game where flavor debuffs of this magnitude are reasonable from a competitive standpoint...</div></div><hr />

well 3rd day in to the class previews and i noticed something, a recurring theme to most specs.<br />
they all have the same mechanic having a long cd skill and some other skill that has a chance to reset the cd.<br />
<br />
so wth are u doing?<br />
making everyone be the same just give them different names?</div></div><hr />

Being enraged makes you TAKE 30% more damage?! That would mean you have to auto-attack whenever a boss is about to do an aoe or targeted attack just in case you get hit so you don't take a massive hit.

Again with the stupid as fuck double standards.<br />
<br />
I assume you're taking more damage while enraged now, to fit the theme of an almost out-of-control killing machine. It does sort of fit that you might be more careless and take more damage. It's also completely different from the old &quot;taking damage to gain rage&quot; - that encouraged players to stand in damaging mechanics. This is actually the complete opposite of that. Not sure how that's a double standard.<br />
<br />
I do agree that 30% increased damage taken seems like a bit much. Maybe they'll tone it down before it goes live, or have talents that help reduce that in some way.</div></div><hr />

It's definitely a typo. The Rampage part says: &quot;Rampage always deals damage as if you were Enraged.&quot;<br />

Definitely not a typo. Did you read what their mastery is? Increases dmg while enraged. And people, ffs, it thematically makes sense! My guess is that they'll drop it to 10-20%. (Shit, as stated above, zerker stance used to increase crit chance at the expense of increased damage taken!)<br />

<br />
No, typical tank cooldowns are around 40-50%. And even at 30%, 30% damage reduction is statistically more meaningful than 30% extra damage taken. Someone taking 100% (regular) damage would last exactly 30% longer than someone taking 130% damage, assuming exactly consistent incoming damage, whereas someone taking 70% damage as opposed to 100% damage would last 42.85% longer, assuming they had the exact same health pool.<br />
<br />
In other words there are increasing returns on damage taken reductions, and diminishing returns on damage taken increments.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, we still don't know the bigger picture for fury. It's possible they'll be adding an extra mechanic to counteract the damage vulnerability, or they'll possibly nerf it to 10% so it's in line with the Berserker Stance of old. Perhaps they'll give warriors some excellent self-heals to compensate, maybe in the form of talents?</div></div><hr />

I'd argue two points: <br />
<br />
1) Ret Paladins offered a lot more utility back then than a Fury Warrior does now (or likely will in Legion)<br />
<br />
2) DPS gameplay has greatly favoured ranged for the last two expansions, and we're about to get another influx of melee DPS with Demon Hunters. Who do you think healers are going to want in their group? The ones that make their jobs that much harder, or the ones that do not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not about the artifact. This is about the core warrior spirit and basic thoughts behind it. If you're backing up the idea of playing arms that way, fine. I don't. Read the names of the class abilities. Recklessness. Overpower. Mortal Strike. So you expect to be a &quot;controlled killer&quot;, waiting for the perfect time to be brutal? I don't. The basic thoughts behind a warrior to me are &quot;Me smash, you die&quot;. I'm sorry I hurt your magey feelings, mister.<br />

Arms seems pretty much the same to me. Tho it now seems to build alot more on Colossus Smash. I'll probably try it.<br />
Fury seems, well, more like arms now. Kinda plain. use Bloodthirst on dc, when Enrage is up use Raging Blow, when no enrage use Rampage. Execute at 20% hp. Will still play it tho...I like Fury :)<br />
Prot..looks good :) I like it, might actually play tank again.<br />

If they can add and extra 30% damage vs another class maybe it will make up for the extra heals needed. Sort of a race condition between extra damage (hit to the healers mana) and the the damage output of the war? /shrug</div></div><hr />

For fury even if the 30% damage increase while enraged stays, don't ignore the fact that fury will have a lot of self healing and/or a way to mitigate that damage in talents.<br />

&quot;Enrage is now considerably more powerful, doubling your attack speed (and thus Rage generation, since the majority of Rage is still generated by auto-attacks), along with increasing damage based on Mastery.&quot; That's from the blurb.<br />

Rampage always deals damage as if you were Enraged.<br />

<br />
You are going to have to explain some of your logic here to me, you hope it isn't a typo, because if it isn't then warriors will suck while not enraged, but can potentially get to low HP or even killed by pulsating boss AOEs or other mechanics because they now take an additional 30% damage while enraged, rather than if it is a typo and we do 30% more damage while enraged.</div></div><hr />

Especially not in WoD where they removed every defensive stat except armor, and even then only put that on a select few items.<br />
<br />
It's like all the parts of WoW are designed by different teams, and they only found out that everything is wrong when they glue all the parts together and find that nothing fits. Then they cut the bumps off the jigsaw pieces and stick them together anyway.<br />
<br />
Except it was highly enjoyable for a large number of players. I personally loved, and still love to play Gladiator. It's playstyle used Prot's offensives in such a way though that it was barely similar to Prot spec, enough that it should have warranted a 4th spec. Yes, they got rid of a lot of defensives for Warriors in stats, but at the same time, almost all tanks perform around the same across the board, depending on fights up to heroic levels of raiding. <br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't design classes so they all are mythic viable, after all. Hardcore mythic raiders know this. There are a lot of classes and specs that simply can never reach the minimum in time for fresh Mythic, and can't keep up as well as their competitors, always. Heroic, everything is mostly managing mechanics and mastering your spec as a player, not so much simply being the class with higher base damage (Hunteeeeeeeeeeeers), though your item level does come into play as the base requirement for entry. <br />
<br />
I hope they keep Gladiator Stance. I'll stop playing my warrior if they get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arms will be shit unless they change Mortal Strike into a generator like it's been for the longest time.<br />
<br />
Fury is looking pretty good, although Enrage mechanic went full retard and Bloodthirst still doesn't auto-crit. They should've just made Rampage a passive that lets Fury spend an Enrage to use Execute early.<br />
<br />
Prot has still has devastate and heroic strike? One or the other Blizz. Remove Heroic Strike and change Revenge into a dump that gives rage per enemy hit, and let it remove the rage cost on parry/dodge. Add back Execute.<br />
<br />
The Spell-Reflect change is also stupid. Just let Block work with all spells (not just melee), problem solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Arms they've made Colossus Smash's effect central, which means to balance Warriors they'll need to make us pretty crap outside of Colossus Smash.<br />
<br />
With Fury it's essentially the same thing but with Enrage instead, that said it also has the added &quot;bonus&quot; of taking 30% more damage? Boss AoE = death. Zerker Rage to break fear in PvP = death. Crit with Bloodthirst before getting Frost Nova'd in PvP = death.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I get the feeling they just pull this crap out like &quot;Wow, that's cool!&quot; without actually thinking of the ramifications in an applied situation.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Both specs now have five rows of core throughput talents (mostly different between Arms and Fury, too), with a strong mix of active rotational abilities, passives, procs, cooldowns, and other interesting effects. You’ll find old favorites like Overpower, Heroic Strike, and Opportunity Strikes, returning classics like Avatar, Dragon Roar, and Storm Bolt, along with a host of brand new talents. We look forward to seeing the combinations that you put together.&quot;</div></div><hr />

This heavily implies that your damage done is increased while enraged, not your damage taken.<br />

Mastery: Unshackled Fury<br />
Increases damage done while Enraged by 28% (with Mastery from typical gear).</div></div><hr />

Did I read correctly that Fury *takes* 30% more dmg while Enraged?<br />
<br />
Correct. Being Enraged reduces your defenses. However, that's offset by a much higher max health, and very high self-healing. We'll tune this as needed to ensure that Fury Warriors are not a liability. 30% may not be the correct number.</div></div><hr />

Did we draw the short straw again when it comes to class developers? Did they run out of ideas when they got to the W for Warrior as the other classes got some really cool mechanics to them....<br />
<br />
For gods sake they can't even get their own &quot;fantasy&quot; for the class right in the description.... I've lost all hope for this class tbh.<br />
<br />
They state:<br />
<br />
<br />
On the battlefield and in the arena, the most feared combatants are often the furious berserkers who lust for battle and thirst for blood. <br />
Through a lifetime of training and sparring, these merciless warriors have become masters of carnage—often wielding a weapon in each hand to maximize the destruction. Even without the protection of a shield, the fury warrior leaves little opportunity for an opponent to strike without suffering grievous wounds in return—delivered in a whirlwind of blades that dooms anyone its wake. Brute force becomes a breathtaking display when fury warriors relentlessly dive into the fray.<br />

Lets break it down...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Ohhh yeah, everybody on the battlefield and in the arena is really going to fear the guy who takes 30% more damage...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
A lifetime of training and sparring only to loose all sense of defence by mindlessly swinging their weapons from left to right and hoping to hit something all the while maximizing their own destruction....<br />
<br />
<br />
Even without the protection of a shield, the fury warrior leaves little opportunity for an opponent to strike without suffering grievous wounds in return<br />
<br />
lol so the fury warrior leaves little opportunity for an opponent to strike without suffering wounds yet we do take 30% extra damage from those strikes we gave them little opportunity to perform... Sure, makes sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
delivered in a whirlwind of blades that dooms anyone its wake. Brute force becomes a breathtaking display when fury warriors relentlessly dive into the fray. <br />
<br />
Apparently we only doom ourselves by getting enraged..... Maybe instead of &quot;Brute force becomes a breathtaking display when fury warriors relentlessly dive into the fray.&quot; it should read &quot;Brute force becomes a breathtaking display (as the other classes are laughing their asses off) when fury warriors dive into the fray like mindless idiots hacking at everything that moves with no regard for their own defence and years of training&quot; <br />
<br />
Again... I give up on this class.....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrotosTheTank</div><div class="date">2015-11-11, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some MASSIVE babies here on this forum about the 30% increase to damage taken. You take that as if you're the TANK who is getting this damage increase.... FFS it's more raid damage taken, if they continue the WoD ratio of health to damage you will never be in a one shot scenario. The only times there's massive damage taken is when it becomes a % of health based attack which is not influenced by damage taken modifiers. All else builds to steady raid-wide damage that can be too much for heals and cause wipes without proper game play. What you're all missing when comparing to &quot;other dps&quot; is how many of these &quot;other dps&quot; have a 5% heal part of your main rotation on a 4.5 sec CD. Have any of you actually raided? or better yet. have any of you raided with raid leaders that are worth a shit and understand game mechanics? <br />
<br />
All that aside, these are initial numbers, I for one welcome the concept. The number may not stick but I sure hell hope you pussies (don't go around acting like a tough warrior after these shitty pleas) don't get your wish and they remove an interesting aspect of a spec, especially one that calls back to the old berserker stance. You know, the one that warriors had where they apparently were never taken to raids and had less self heals than they will in Legion.<br />

Melee Range, Instant, 45 sec cooldown<br />
Smashes the enemy’s armor, dealing massive Physical damage, and increasing damage you deal to them by 20% for 6 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tactician<br />
Passive<br />
Slam, Whirlwind, and Execute have a 20% chance per target hit to reset the cooldown on Colossus Smash.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Titanic Might<br />
Passive<br />
Increases the duration of Colossus Smash by 200%, but halves its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Titanic might seems a bit underwhelming. Slam only costs 15 rage and has a 20% chance to reset cd on Colossus Smash. On average it should take you 3 slams/whirlwinds/executes to proc Tactician, that's 45 rage in case of slam only, +20 rage for MS which has a 6s cooldown.<br />
<br />
So in most cases you would need to regenerate ~11 rage per second to maintain colossus smash and use mortal strike on cooldown.<br />
<br />
(also, Tactician hints at WW still being in the game. Hopefully not a part of single target rotation.)<br />

good to know that at least you have clues... <br />
you can use defensive cooldowns, you can avoid dmg, you can play properly and not just wait from healers.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you play warrior or how many years you've been playing, but since tbc (that I first started playing warrior after dumbing my mage) fury warrior had never issues with extra dmg from enrage in raids etc... it had though in pvp - that's a different story and I will agree with anyone saying that there could be a serious issue there.<br />
<br />
Also there is no such thing as one shot in blizzards world in any raid ever if you are geared up properly for the tier and you are at full health (maybe in Cata that I didnt played)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeldorian</div><div class="date">2015-11-12, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We talked about this a lot yesterday in the fury legion discussion thread, and most of us there already have accepted (not really accepted..but) the fact fury warriors will not be taken to raids if this stays. <br />
<br />
Stop saying &quot;Oh but we'll probably get extra self heals and shit&quot;. Why even add the 30% damage taken thing if they are just going to counter it with self heals, that makes the point of the 30% modifier null. Our survival kit is already shit anyway, the extra 30% damage taken and self heals will end up cancelling each other out, or making us unacceptable in raids. Focusing on healing ourselves instead of DPSing will be a problem, and that does not fit the theme of the warrior &quot;berserker&quot; at all.<br />
<br />
Reason for not being taken to raids: Melee are already just a &quot;meh&quot; thing to take in raids, but as it stands with this preview, why take a warrior who takes 30% extra damage and makes the healers heal for more (warriors are berserkers, not self healers if you want to go by fantasy) when they could take a DK who self heals more than a warrior, and takes less damage. Taking a fury warrior now would just be a liability to the raid and no healers are going to want to work harder to heal just one person in the raid, especially when there are other options like DK who can self heal a lot more without even trying, and don't take 30% extra damage.<br />
<br />
Let me TLDR this: No amount of self heals will cancel that 30% damage modifier out, unless half of our abilities are heals. They already said our health pool will be increased by 31% above the average person, (25% base health pool, 6% extra hp from TG) so that makes the 30% damage taken useless, but we will still require more healing in raids, whether our health pool is larger than others or not. That makes us both a liability in our raid, and a hindrance on healers in our raid group. Sure, we haven't seen the other talents yet, and this probably still has to be tuned accordingly, but I'm speaking about what we see right now. Can't speak about talents and abilities we haven't seen yet, and I'm not going to place my hopes and dreams there.</div></div><hr />
