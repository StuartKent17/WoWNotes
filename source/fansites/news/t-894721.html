Cory Stockton interview on Buffed.de - Patch 4.2 Extra Information<br />
We're finally bathing in tons of delicious Patch 4.2 information and the latest update comes from an interview of Cory Stockton on Buffed.de (http://www.buffed.de/World-of-Warcraft-PC-16678/Specials/WoW-Patch-42-Epische-Quest-Reihe-Feuerland-Bosse-und-mehr-Lead-Content-Designer-Cory-Stockton-im-Interview-zu-Patch-42-822077/)! <br />
<br />
List mostly built from the translation posted by Samin on our forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/894673-4.2-New-Information?p=11247718). <br />
<br />
Firelands Raid:<br />
<br />
The raid instance is supposed to be 4 times the size of Obsidian Sanctum, roughly the size of Alterac Valley<br />
All the bosses will have new models<br />
Ground mounts will be allowed.<br />
The first four bosses will be non-linear before you get to the final three that are in a linear fashion, with Ragnaros at the end. <br />
Ragnaros will be the final boss. It will NOT be an heroic-only encounter like Sinestra but the heroic version will be completely different from the normal one and developers wanted to make sure it feels really unique and pretty hardcore. <br />
There will be more bars/meters to make it easier to watch certain mechanics in contrast to a simple debuff stacking<br />
You won't need fire resistance and bosses won't have any either. <br />
There will be epic recipies drops for all the usual professions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 12 Armor Sets<br />
<br />
All T12 sets will be fire themed (duh)<br />
Not new but reminder: Warlock will be themed after those awesome looking fire spiders<br />
One plate set will be themed after the new fire giants (Anthricyst maybe?), the shoulders will be like the fire giant's face.<br />
Set bonus will be firelands themed too and may resemble certain boss abilities<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Misc.<br />
<br />
There will be a new Baradin Hold boss - another loot pinata (his words!)<br />
The interviewer also asked for a second raid dungeon, Cory ignored that part and only answered the Baradin Hold part - interpret yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legendary:<br />
<br />
The proc of the weapon will be offensive and not suited for healers<br />
Weapon will be forged in major cities (Stormwind and Orgrimmar respectively)<br />
There will be a 'very long' event with a lot of voice acting and the Blue Dragonflight.<br />
Your guild will get a reward if you complete the achievement for the Legendary staff. It will most likely be a pet, it will have an unique look (not necessarily fiery) and a &quot;legendary&quot; feel. <br />
Both 10 &amp; 25 are supposed to get the weapon roughly at the same pace<br />
25M will have s small advantage of getting the profession related parts done quicker<br />
Nothing more on what profession related parts of the legendary are but it will be only a minor part of the progression to the legendary, focus is on raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Encounter Journal (i.e. boss guides):<br />
<br />
Will be on PTR<br />
Will not require unlocking by killing the boss or something<br />
They start with entries for Cataclysm content only but plan to add WotLK, TBC and vanilla entries too - later<br />
There will be no loot wishlist but they have plans for that. Loot will be listed for encounters and sorted by difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests:<br />
<br />
There will be a new epic level 85 questline around Thrall<br />
It's not revealed if that is about Thrall (maybe) becoming the new aspect of earth<br />
No epics as reward, story is the reward<br />
This new questline can be completed entirely in solo.<br />
New Daily quests will be &quot;modular&quot; i.e. you start with a base set of quests and earn a currency as reward. With this currency you can unlock other quest hubs and decide how you unlock all of the dailies. This will be acompanied by heavy phasing.<br />
Phasing will only change the area, you will still be able to play with your friends even if they have progressed further<br />
There will be new gear, cosmetic rewards, and mounts. <br />
<br />

<br />
Please note that this only refers to Ragnaros! At least that's what can be read from the interview, no word on other heroic encounters.<br />
<br />
@Boubouille: I clarified a few things in my original forum post, but I guess that line about heroic encounters definitely needs to be updated to not be misunderstood.</div></div><hr />

It's the boss information thing they announced for cataclysm. So on the dungeon map (I guess) you can click on the boss room and it will give you a list of abilities and a general direction on what to watch out for, ofc without explaining you how to do the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The news about Firelands sounds interesting, but I'll withhold judgement until I see the actual instance. Seven bosses seems rather low given how long it's taking them to get the instance out.</div></div><hr />

It actually contains a bunch of new information. Like:<br />
<br />
<br />
This time around they have, however, resulting in some sexy Ragnaros-styled armor, a new non-legendary version of his mace, Sulfuros, and a druid staff that drops off one of raid's other bosses that transforms the wielder into a molten cat.<br />
<br />
The new dungeon even boasts three new mounts; one for competing all of the raid achievements, one random drop, and a special mount that drops every time Ragnaros fails.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, this is the most important change on that list!<br />
<br />
If they change all the current phasing quests in both the old world and in the Cataclysm zones to work like that, it would pretty much fix the whole leveling experience :D<br />
<br />
Now they just need to make the Dungeon Finder server-only and I might just consider resubbing ^^</div></div><hr />

I hope the warrior gets a set that looks like steel plating again. i just dont like this &quot;stoned&quot; gem look the t11 has. <br />
something like t5 shoulders with a bit more of firelands style and a head like the t6 would be nice ^^<br />

<br />
OS is actually pretty big. Just because it's only one boss doesn't mean it's tiny. If you put 4 of those together you get a pretty huge zone. Of course it won't LOOK like 4 OS - space will be used in totally different ways.</div></div><hr />

Kalecgos replaced him as the Leader of the Blue Dragonflight, he is no where near as powerful as Malygos was, due to him not being blessed by Norgannon, same thing here, except it's more stupid cause only dragons should be able to become Aspects, seems like a really bad retcon if it's true.</div></div><hr />

Mah, they said it just over a year ago (http://www.wowblues.com/eu/cataclysm-raid-progression-refinements-13200223842.html), things change in a year. This has been &quot;the Firelands patch&quot; for long enough that I think everyone knew what they were getting.</div></div><hr />

Multiple raids PER TIER.<br />
<br />
T11 has 3 raids, 1 mini-raid. T12, SO FAR, has 1 raid, and 1 mini-raid. They never said anything about multiple raids per patch; they said multiple raids per tier. There's still plenty of time to patch in another raid, and to give it more build-up/presentation rather than rushing it out.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember blizzard EVER releasing a major patch during the summer holidays, and my guild will collectively feel suicidal if it turns out it's after.

It's possible that the staff is a relic of the blue dragonflight, lost when Deathwing defeated them. I'm guessing once you obtain all the fragments you'll need to go to Coldarra to forge the weapon, given all the ley lines and arcane energy around the area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree that the uncorrupted egg is more likely for the position of the Aspect of Earth, where does it say that all Aspects Have to be dragons? Yes, the Titans empowered 5 Dragons, because they were the dominant species at the time. That does not entail that only dragons can be Aspects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they change all the current phasing quests in both the old world and in the Cataclysm zones to work like that, it would pretty much fix the whole leveling experience :D<br />
<br />
Now they just need to make the Dungeon Finder server-only and I might just consider resubbing ^^<br />
<br />
i'd love a checkbox for that in dungeonfinder ... cause at night when few people are on or i am levelling twinks in 1-80 dungeons i dont actually care where people come from ... when doing 85 heroics esp in prime time 19-23h i DO care and would want them from my own server</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously. If blizzard make Thrall into the aspect of earth, it would kill the story for me in wow. All this promise that Thrall would return one day to the horde, would be cut right there. They'd make Thrall into a demi god, and he'd never be able to return.<br />
<br />
If this goes about, any hope I had in the story of wow would be gone, and thats pretty much the only thing keeping me playing it these days.<br />

<br />
My thoughts exactly. Thrall has to be mortal. What he does it part of the mortal plane. He's a hero because of who and what he is, an orc unlike any other. If they make him into an overpowered aspect, he would either have to be made into a dragon, or just be so powerful he'd need to be godlike, and when he becomes godlike, he'd never be able to return to the mortal world or among his people.<br />
<br />
This would kill his character, and just like Bolvar, shove him out of sight and mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your only choice is the hard mode. And that's the way it really should be. Saying you want to experience the HC fight without being in a HC is like saying that you want to get paid without working a single hour. It's unreasonable. <br />
<br />
And as a clarification, I'm a huge fan of the &quot;casualcraft&quot; this game has become, it leaves me with so much more to do when I don't have the time/will to raid regularily. But I don't go around demanding to eat the same cake as the HC raiders, it just doesn't work that way.</div></div><hr />
