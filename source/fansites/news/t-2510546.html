Really? I mean I haven't seen any of the actual quest content coming in the patch, but that's really all they're adding unless you're Alliance and can farm the bee mount. I'm excited, but doesn't seem like it'll take that long to go through the content personally.</div></div><hr />

It seems pretty big for a .5 to me. Mainly I'm just curious to find out what all the encrypted quests and cutscenes are. This is the first time we're going into a storyline completely blind.</div></div><hr />

I think (hope) it's just the model viewer displaying it incorrectly. I think it is supposed to be rather classic ponytail.</div></div><hr />

The model viewer doesn't apply physics, so her hair doesn't fall down and animate.<br />
<br />
Personally I would just love for it to remain that way. Imagine all those deadly serious conversations and cinematics with no one even batting an eye at her hair sticking out like that. &quot;Don't mention the hair, she's a master assassin!&quot;</div></div><hr />

It is highly unlikely that this years event will be only two weeks long. What is more likely is that it will start either around October 8th (The 15th CE release/ship date) or November 1st (Blizzcon) So 1-2 months long. Or go even longer into December.</div></div><hr />

In legion they were all big about how the X.X.0 patches would be the big content patches and then the X.X.5 patches would be the patches where they would address class and balance issues since they would have gotten enough info from the mythic raid runs / new seasons / etc.<br />
<br />
This whole expansion is rather lackluster in class changes overal I have to say. <br />
Sure the balance is quite OK when you look at the big picture, but there are a lot of specs still under performing and/or over performing. It wouldn't hurt to shake up the meta slightly once in a while.<br />
To be frank this whole expansion lacks in overal class changes. They have done some slight tweaking left and right, but hardly anything significant.<br />

I had hoped for more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. Right from the beginning, BfA was the first expansion to do almost nothing to the vast majority of classes / specs. So for those who played Legion the entire time, BfA really was nothing more than 7.4.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually, I would say that the balance isn't very okay. Shadow Priests are highly overtuned at 20% to 30% above median dps for most raids, and Arcane Mage is about 20% lower than the median. Even ignoring those outliers, there is a 15% to 20% variation among the rest. That is actually a pretty poor spread to be leaving unaddressed.<br />
<br />
While I've seen bigger discrepancies in the past, I've never seen Blizz ignore that large of a discrepancy with a .0 or a .5 release.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had hoped for more.<br />
<br />
Completely agree. This whole expansion has been done on the cheap. The vast majority of work has been graphical updates (which doesn't cost them much, being pretty cheap and fast to accomplish).<br />
<br />
This isn't really 8.2.5, it is, in reality, 7.6.5, and Blizz were being greedy SoBs to charge $60 for 7.4.</div></div><hr />

LFR does work if you can find enough time, and it's really not that tough to get enough Nazjatar rep. Are you playing the game currently?</div></div><hr />

I cannot find enough time, else Jaina would not be an issue.<br />
<br />
Problem is not Nazjatar rep, problem is followers rep. I am revered with the faction but miss 1500 points or so to reach 3k.<br />
<br />
And btw, why on earth have i to reach 3k with the Nazjatar followers to unlock a quest for the War campaign? They are totally unrelated, of all the stupid rep gates I saw in these 15 years this ranks in the top 3 for sure.<br />
<br />
Edit: indeed they lifted at least the Jaina part. Just logged in and in the Zuldazar boat there was the quest available to pay respect to dead Rastakhan. Now let's see if continuing i can free Baine also without the namor goblins rep.</div></div><hr />
