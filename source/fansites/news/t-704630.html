Gemming Old Items Issue<br />
There is currently an issue that we are aware of where gems and enchantments are missing from items that had them before we released patch 3.3.3 this week. This appears to be affecting some equipment that was acquired before the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. We are planning to resolve this during the next maintenance on Tuesday, March 30th, and recommend that you do not try to gem or re-gem any of this gear until after that time. We will provide further updates if this situation changes.</div></div><hr />

Truth be told, i reported the problem with missing gems on the PTR. Some of my warriors T6 was missing gems, as was my Hunter's &lt;a href=http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=595&gt;lolRPsilverwingsentinal&lt;/a&gt; set. (A must have for any kill shot.)<br />
<br />
It's not the first time reported bugs slipped through the cracks.</div></div><hr />
