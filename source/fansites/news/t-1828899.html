Get Ready for Gamescom 2015!<br />
It looks like the next expansion may not be demoed at Gamescom, as the listing below only talks about playing Warlords.<br />
Blizzard’s gearing up for another epic gamescom this year! From August 5-9, we’ll be providing plenty of entertainment at our biggest booth to date in Hall 7 of the Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany.<br />
<br />
The highlight of the show will happen on the Blizzard stage on Thursday, August 6 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, when we unveil the next expansion for World of Warcraft! Catch it in person or via live stream at www.blizzgc.com.<br />

New Expansion and Communication<br />
Seriously, even though there are people frustrated with aspects of Warlords, or simply just a little worn out from spending so many years playing this game, I hope your curiosity about what we've got cooking is still there. It should be a fun event next week. I trust that many people in this community can check any baggage they might have at the door and earnestly step into the announcement with us.<br />
<br />
It's not just about building hype either. We want to share what lies ahead and get some new conversations going. <br />
<br />
I can say no more!<br />
<br />
Is that not hype? lol<br />
I mean, that's the thing. Hype is innately a part of announcing a thing. I've just seen a lot of people talk about our &quot;hype machine&quot; in a highly cynical fashion lately. I know it's because we've announced some things and then changed our plans or cut them further along in development.<br />
<br />
I'll just say that we're sensitive to that. Our intent is never to share big ideas or plans purely for the purposes of generating additional hype. All that's going to do is breed frustration and mistrust down the road. None of us chose careers in snake oil sales.<br />
<br />
And then, when people don't like what lies ahead and start talking about it, locking those new coversations!<br />
I don't know if that's an honest comment or more of a jab. But either way, I've been moderating and posting in blue on Blizzard forums for 9 years now, and never has there been a time where we've tried to completely stamp out honest conversations of opinions about the game or speculation of what's to come -- at least not simply on the merit that the opinions being expressed on a given topic are largely negative. <br />
<br />
Anyone who reads this and wonders why specific threads they were involved in were deleted in the past, the answer is almost definitely in our forum posting guidelines and Code of Conduct. Nowhere in those guidelines, however, does it say that you aren't allowed to share a negative opinion of the game. For real!<br />
<br />
Zar says easily misconstrued things far to often and when someone calls him out on his often dismissive and arrogant tone he just stops responding or says he was misunderstood. The fact that (as he'll often tell you) he's been a blue for 9 years means he should know to chose what words he uses veeerryy carefully. For that reason, I'm inclined to take everything he says at face value.<br />
I choose my words carefully. But I'm also not going to be a perfectly polished PR robot when I'm sharing in conversation on the forums. I don't think a lot of people would appreciate it if I was either.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with you taking what I say at face value. That's fair. I don't know that your summation of my communication style is very fair though. I'm vastly outnumbered on this forum and my words are in bright blue to attract everyone. And there are scores of people who will take every possible angle to pick at what I'm saying. And I know that that's going to happen before I hit the &quot;Submit&quot; button, but I'm not going to let that completely tongue tie me when I want to talk to people.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for sympathy. It's part of the job, I know. The job also requires a lot of empathy and a lot of rallying on behalf of players when discussing feedback internally. Hopefully, even if my manner of posting rubs you the wrong way, you can at least understand that we're not meant to be at odds with one another. We want a fun video game that brings people together with joy, regardless of how complicated that can be for a game and community of this magnitude.<br />
<br />
My main issue with the blue posting is that they often never respond to well thought out threads regarding actual game suggestions, and threads that are actually addressing valid concerns with the game.<br />
We may not respond to many, but we certainly read them, note them down, and relay the feedback directly to developers. We've said it before; there are times where we just can't comment, or we're privy to information about upcoming changes that we've been asked not to address (we don't want to spoil all the surprises). It's part of the process and part of our job. But that doesn't mean we don't care or aren't reading your feedback. Sure, we could jump into a suggestion or feedback thread and merely post, &quot;Thank you!&quot;, but that's often seen as antagonistic to some, and not nearly enough for others.<br />
<br />
By all means, please keep posting suggestions and feedback. We do appreciate it, and we'll continue to relay it to the developers.<br />
<br />
It makes it very hard for me to get hyped for next expansion when devs in interviews don't focally acknowledge how bad certain things are right now. &quot;We learned some lessons&quot; does not give me hope for a better future, because we've heard that line a thousand times over.<br />
I do understand your point and don't want to distract from it, but also that statement is 100% true every time we use it. We always learn a lot from the design decisions we make, and how they play out in both a test and live environment, that we can carry forward. And that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
There's a vast amount of game design knowledge and expertise on the team, but like virtually any other job you still learn as you go and do your best to positively apply that extra knowledge in your latest work.<br />
<br />
You may not be able to get say much, but a small little pop in saying you at least saw and are relaying the topics would be HUGE. When people see no responces even though we may believe you guys are listening it starts to look otherwise. The players are just as passionate of the game as you guys are and simple small acknowledgements would go a long way to have people at least know you saw the post. Especialy with the big hot topics. I really feel sorry for the pvp'ers. those poor buggers don't get any info at all.and every suggestion seems to be countered with another terrible idea.<br />
I won't say that's a bad idea and I don't mean to come off as stubborn here. In principle I agree with you and we've done those types of acknowledging responses in the past. Sometimes, though, the acknowledgement creates a separate issue unto itself from the &quot;we're being ignored&quot; perception, in that people sometimes take the acknowledgement as an indication of action on our part. At first it's a pretty innocent, positive thing to show acknowledgement. But, depending on what the feedback is about, some people will ask why we haven't done anything about it 24 hours later, a week later, a month later, what have you.<br />
<br />
It creates an almost cyclical pattern where people still feel ignored if we let the acknowledgement sit alone and linger without more input from us, except it can create even more tension 'cause we're viewed as blatantly disregarding something we previously acknowledged. Now suddenly we're viewed as willfully or stubbornly ignoring a topic we've clearly seen. The act of acknowledging is just another empty gesture at that point.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not saying it's never a good idea. It usually depends on the circumstances. But those are just things we have to think about and weigh before tagging something in blue. As I said earlier in the thread, the blue tends to bring a lot more attention to a topic. If we throw acknowledgements around without more meaningful input to provide as a follow-up, or without some type of clear design reaction, after a while it's going to come across as insincere, and synonymous with ignoring the issue anyway.<br />
<br />
The field of Communications can be pretty complicated, even when you want to keep things as simple, transparent, and honest as possible. No matter what type of community is formed around something, especially online, people will dissect everything that's said, pick statements apart, reinterpret words, band together over common beliefs/opinions, drift toward whatever popular theories are going around, etc. And I don't mean any of this in a cynical or condescending way. It's just sort of how we're wired, and the internet adds a whole other element to social behavior in a community. If that makes sense...<br />
Which leads me to this question: do you guys ever post on normal accounts? Participate in a discussion posing as another player, so as to mitigate the influence and impact the blue text has?<br />
No. It feels too shady. I chat with folks on my characters in the game like anyone else, but it just feels different on the forums. When we're not posting as actively on the forums we're often looking at things on a more macro scale -- including using some Community Management System tools behind the scenes for data analysis -- figuring out what are the common points of feedback and such, so for me it'd feel too much like meddling to jump in &quot;anonymously.&quot; (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/382076-dear-zarhym/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300116718?page=10#192))<br />

Why? Its single player &quot;content&quot; where everything is based on timer and accessed through menus. Players are rewarded for logging in every few hours, not for actually playing game. Such game play doesn't have any RPG elements and it has nothing to do with MMO, so why do you want such feature in MMORPG game?<br />
<br />
It is the worst feature ever introduced to game. Several million players quit game because of it.<br />
<br />
I hope none of garrisons and followers crap makes it into next expansion. I want MMORPG back!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barely anyone will use them if they are really optional. Even now when literally EVERYTHING is tied into them and you are almost ruining the game for yourself if you don't use them people still don't want to play in their garrison. It's extremely forced on players and that's why everyone is complaining about them. Make them REALLY optional and that all goes away but then it just becomes a huge waste of developer time and resources.<br />
<br />
I really don't get people who want garrisons to stay. No offense but, get your head out of your ass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benggaul</div><div class="date">2015-07-31, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense but, get your head out of your ass.<br />
<br />
You know, saying &quot;No offense&quot; doesn't really excuse you then immediately saying something offensive.<br />
<br />
Also, it's pretty easy to understand why a lot of players--and it is a lot, by the way--want garrisons to still be a thing in the next expansion. They won't be, according to the devs in previous interviews, but it still remains a fairly popular feature. Why? For one, it makes the average player feel as if they're important. They get to make decisions and build their own area to their liking--to a degree. They get to shape and experience their own part of the story.<br />
<br />
Secondly, alt-aholism aside, &quot;managing your garrison&quot; really doesn't take that long on a daily basis. 15 minutes tops, if you're really trying to get every building humming at maximum and send every one of your followers out for missions (which is really wasted time once they're max level and fully equipped--just send them out on the important or lucrative missions, not just random XP gains for the hope of some petty salvage). I can usually finish anything I need to in my garrison within 5 minutes of logging in by now. Unless you suffer from real OCD issues--which isn't the fault of the game--there's no real reason taking care of the daily stuff in your garrison should be eating up much of your playtime at all.<br />
<br />
Third, it's a great storytelling and immersion tool. You essentially build your own quest hub and get to interact with characters you meet throughout the life of the expansion. Rather than saving someone out in the wild and then watching 20 other people save that person throughout the expansion, they turn up on your doorstep offering to lend a hand, and they stay there with you, offering words of thanks or a helping hand any time you pass by. Some are more useful than others, of course, but seeing your garrison swell from just a few peons and notable NPC's from the start to a town center that is evolving and full of life is desirable for many people.<br />
<br />
And then there's the fact that sometimes you just need a place to rest that isn't occupied by every jackass on the server who just got a mount from an earlier expansion and wants to show it off by sitting on top of an important quest-giver/mailbox/whatever. There's a lot to be said for your own private sanctuary.<br />
<br />
There are many more reasons than I care to spend time listing, but I think these are some of the more important. If garrisons aren't your thing, that's fine, of course, but I'd say putting down the idea itself or those that DO enjoy them is really going too far. I can't stand PvP in this game. I haven't since it was first introduced in Vanilla and I've found no joy in it whatsoever at any point during any of the expansions. I just can't find it in me to find any amusement in it the times I'm forced to do it for some reason or another (and there have been a few times for me where it's been nearly mandatory--admittedly for items or mounts that are not otherwise obtainable). That doesn't, however, mean that I think it's a completely bad idea to have PvP in the game or that those who do participate in it are all somehow mentally challenged.<br />

There will be lot of stuff uploaded by them (wallpapers, artworks, mop like introduction videos, etc), just like how for example Overwatch was handled. You knew nothing of it then bamm, an entire website dedicated to it.<br />
<br />
I expect similiar treatment</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here here! An eloquent and righteous defense of a feature I think too many people demonize. <br />
<br />
Garrisons have some issues (Mining each node is slow and boring when you need to run around and then back out, the gated professions were a bit painful during the most important time when they were needed) but overall I liked it. My biggest complaint would be the alt factor. Doing the same task on 2, 3 or 4, let alone 10 alts is time consuming and can get a bit boring. If something like the garrison is attempted again, being more alt friendly should be a priority - especially in an expansion that sold itself partly on many people creating alts. <br />
<br />
That said, I did love that there was this little corner that was mine, with the things I liked, that had my guild banners waving, that had my followers and pets running around. That meant more to me than the inconveniences.</div></div><hr />

Well they need to stop replying to obvious baiting comments. Its a no-win situation for them.<br />
<br />
Meh. Zarhym baits with the best of them, with comments like &quot;leave your baggage at the door&quot;. In his world, you're either a fanboy with damp panties at every announcement and patch they poop out, or you're a cynical troll with an agenda who's burned out from playing wow too long. <br />
<br />
Honestly, with an attitude like that driving policy there, just shut them down.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, even though there are people frustrated with aspects of Warlords, or simply just a little worn out from spending so many years playing this game, I hope your curiosity about what we've got cooking is still there. It should be a fun event next week. I trust that many people in this community can check any baggage they might have at the door and earnestly step into the announcement with us.<br />

It's not just about building hype either. We want to share what lies ahead and get some new conversations going. <br />

Even now when literally EVERYTHING is tied into them and you are almost ruining the game for yourself if you don't use them people still don't want to play in their garrison. It's extremely forced on players and that's why everyone is complaining about them. Make them REALLY optional and that all goes away but then it just becomes a huge waste of developer time and resources.<br />
<br />
I really don't get people who want garrisons to stay. No offense but, get your head out of your ass.<br />
<br />
Lol. No the wrost feature ever is LFR. Garrision takes the apect of hanging out in the major city, but it promotes logging in. You act like wow didnt feel like a single player game before garrisions, no it gelt like a single player game since yhe introduction of Randon dungeons finder in WOTLK, and the became a full time single player game with LFR, garrision did nothing new to it. People dodnt quit because of garrisions, they quit because of lack of content, dont get the two mess up.<br />
<br />
Garrisions would be great if it wasnt require to optimize raiding or could kill proffessions.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, I'm keeping neutral. I was skeptical for MoP and it turned out as my all-time best time in this game. I was hyped-as-fuck for Cata and WoD and they both turned out as expansions that I couldn't wait to pass in order to get to the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Don't post ignorant shit. Unless you ask every single one why they quit you have no fucking idea what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
You're in the minority. Most people with a brain can figure out there was nothing wrong with garrisons. The problem is revolving an entire expansion around them with nothing else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xcruiser</div><div class="date">2015-08-01, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people with a brain can figure out there was nothing wrong with garrisons.<br />
<br />
Also guilty of making ignorant generalizations and claiming people who don't like garrisons are in the minority. I speak for myself, and I think garrisons are terrible. They are terrible for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, the way they marginalized professions, both gathering materials(for example, in the past I recall running dungeons well past their prime just to acquire necessary crafting materials) and creating items(similarly, patterns for professions were acquired out in the world actually doing something, instead of feeding a machine for a couple of days and out pops the currency to pay for the patterns). Followers/ships are a &quot;feature&quot; that end up feeling like I'm vicariously experiencing content, where NPCs are going on the missions and I'm sitting at my garrison twiddling my thumbs. The concept of being a commander and overseeing the operations of my army/fort is good in theory, but did not translate well at all in execution. I'm thoroughly displeased with WoD's content outside of raiding and ready to move on to the next expansion hoping that the Blizzard WoW team has, in fact, learned from their mistakes this time (where they've said 6.2 was too late to implement any feedback they've gotten between WoD's release and now), and actually give the players a reason to log in besides raiding and chores. Remember &quot;fun&quot;? Let's do that.</div></div><hr />
