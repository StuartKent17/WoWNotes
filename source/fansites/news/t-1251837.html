Heroic Pandaria dungeons now award 100 Justice points per boss. Gold drops for those bosses have also been changed from a static 50 gold to a 40-60 gold range. Less gold will drop in groups consisting of less than 5 players.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria Season 2 Malevolent Gladiator’s PvP gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-search=Malevolent&amp;filter-source=512) can now be purchased with Honor Points instead of Conquest Points, including weapons.<br />
All newly purchased Season 2 Malevolent Gladiator’s armor, offhands, and shields (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-max=476&amp;filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-search=Malevolent%20Gladiator) will have an item level of 476 (was 483). Existing Malevolent items are unaffected.<br />
Balance, Feral, Windwalker, Retribution, Shadow, Enhancement and Elemental now gain 25% of the bonus healing provided by PvP Power (was 0%). Dedicated healers will continue to gain 50% of the bonus healing provided by PvP Power and 0% damage from PvP Power.<br />
For casters and healers, PVP Power is now split evenly between main-hand and off-hand in a manner similar to a dual-wield melee class. This change is retroactive, affecting Season 12 Malevolent and Malevolent Elite items. There should be no net change for any character already using a main-hand/off-hand combination.<br />
PVP Caster weapons in Season 13 cost 2250 Conquest Points (down from 2500) and shields/off-hands cost 1250 (up from 1000), to reflect the increased value of the off-hand slot for classes that use it in this manner. This change is not retroactive and applies only to Season 13 items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Players in low level battlegrounds will have their effective level raised to the maximum level allowed in that battleground bracket. Players' base stats and spells are scaled accordingly and are treated as the same level when determining hits, misses, and critical effect chance.<br />
Rated Battlegrounds now award conquest to the losing team based on their final score. The losing team can earn up to 200 Conquest Points from a very close match.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Transmogrification rules have been broadened for several weapon types.<br />
<br />
Two-handed axes, maces, and swords can be Transmogrified to each other.<br />
One-handed axes, maces, and swords can be Transmogrified to each other.<br />
Staves and polearms can be transmogrified to each other.<br />
<br />
The ethereals that offered to upgrade items using Valor or Justice points have departed Azeroth for the moment. They may yet return in a future patch.<br />
The cost of Valor Point gear introduced in patch 5.0 (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-max=495&amp;filter-source=4096) has been reduced by 50%.<br />
The cost of Valor Point gear introduced in patch 5.1 (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16139&amp;filter-source=4096) has been reduced by 25%.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
The Reputation panel on the character screen will now let players know which reputations they have purchased and used Grand Commendations for.<br />
There is now an option to show absorb effects (such as Power Word: Shield) on player, target, party and raid frames. This feature is currently enabled if you turn on the predictive healing option. Unlike predictive healing, absorb effects will display for enemy targets.<br />

Calm your rage, if the players haven't turned off their exp gains then they won't even be in the same bracket as your twink... In other words, this change has nothing to do with you, just another fun way for lowbies to level. Unless you're one of those lowbie stompers that just hop in a BG to pick on weaker players..

Can you BE any more elitist? Please...<br />
<br />
This change is very nice, particularly for NEW players. &quot;whining noobs that can't afford atleast few heirlooms&quot;. How do you suggest a NEW player should go about buying said heirlooms?<br />
<br />
Also nice to see the change to Chain Lightning. Given it's high mana cost, it was rather ridiculous to keep the &quot;punishment&quot; of diminished damage to secondary targets. You still can't spam Chain Lightning without going oom.</div></div><hr />

There is a reason why they twink at said level.<br />
On a side note, Heirloom gear + enchant on xp-on BGs will always stomp new players. With or without scaling. Period.<br />
<br />
Now about screwing real twinks. <br />
Example:<br />
I play twinks 70 atm.<br />
Before jumping on saying I kill lowbies and ungeared players: nope. My experience is OFF and only play agains other 70s BiS toons. Not leveling players. So haters take your rage elsewhere thanks.<br />
This change means my 70 twinks and their scaling will turn 74 in BG screwing my crits. It means re-gearing completely as a 74. Problem is, 74 gear is bad (beside engi 72 googles). It means: my bracket, my fun dies with this change and most will move on in upper or mostly lower brackets (19 or 64 is my guess). And god knows the fun of many already died with baseline resilience and 90% resilience 70 healers.<br />
<br />
If this goes live I kan kiss most of my fun goodbye.</div></div><hr />

False. It doesn't sound like they level up your gear, just your level apportionment.<br />
<br />
Hell, if anything, now you and your chums can make free accounts and just twink at 20, as you'll be level 24. All for freeeeeee. <br />

Yeah sucks to lose an OP advantage...? Looks like you need to get skills insted of outlvling/gearing everyone with your heirlooms, and no - not everyone can afford them (Me my self got all heirlooms, but that's not the point). So stop bitching about it, this is an awesome change to somewhat balance low lvl brackets, I remember I loved it in SWTOR, where only the gear made the difference.</div></div><hr />

Finaly some warrior nerfs? They have been nerfed the whole season.. I almost feel bad for them, but then they get lucky in a arena match and do a massive critt - and the feelings for them are gone.. The only big nerf they get in 5.2 is survability realy. Wonder how the new ToB will work though.<br />

I knew the last few twinks would rage. Okay soo. &quot;Whining noobs that can't afford heirlooms&quot;, there are still people just starting playing or have 2 accounts, not everyone can afford heirloom simply because they don't have a 90.<br />
&quot;Damn whiners go do dungoes&quot; Reffering to my asnwer above also adding. Not everyone wanna do dungeons.<br />
Twinks ruin the game for the people who actually level doing bgs.<br />
Besides if you really wanna be as good as you think you are, why don't you just do bgs at level 90 or keep the game as close to balance as humanly possible?

Yes because EVERY PERSON in a BG instantly has a level 90 in which to get heirlooms, after all its not like WoW EVER has new players joining amirite!?<br />
<br />
This is more -fair- than you twinks stomping all over everything and laughing. Learn to play the game and max where at least some skill is required. Blizzard has said countless times, over and over that they do not nor will they ever support twinking. It is why they keep doing stuff to counter it. Like adding Exp to PVP and allowing people to turn off exp gains but then get put into their own group and not allowed in the normal BG.</div></div><hr />

And lvl 70 twinks got they exp locked, so they wont be teamed up against/with lvlers. They also do alot of arena, where they are up against equally geared twinks. <br />

So you are saying that the 70 twinks are locked out and only battle against other who have locked they're experiene? Then tell it to blizz, if this is how it works out for 70's blizz should listen. But I haven't heard anything like people in level 70 with exp lock are banned for the other bgs where they actually have exp lock of. If this is true, I take back what I said to him, if not go buy a new life!</div></div><hr />

Everyone that locks their exp wont get into the same BGs as lvlers (Atleast thats how it was a few years ago last time I twinked, and I cant recall hearing anything changed)<br />

Surely the metagem is intended for the meta socket from the 5.1 questline?? Makes more sense to continually upgrade the weapon through each stage than it does to throw a random gem in another piece of gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In theory yes, however I won't say anything for sure as shamans are not a regular customer for being able to use swords in the first place, a warrior can use both sword and axes, however a shaman can't equip a sword. Also illidan's blades are class locked. How this all plays in I am not sure, but from what they are saying, yes you very should be able. But they might have forgotten to add that &quot;wep equip criteries play in&quot;; to the notes.<br />

Last time I was in a bg meeting twinks with full heriloom was back in cata 4.3 So that might have changed back or something, also from what I could tell from honorable kills, achvis etc on the armory, I could only find one logical answer, they exp were indeed locked.</div></div><hr />

Also, because DISC is obviously in a much much better state as HOLY, regarding throughput, people don't play HOLY at all anymore. And you face palm, every time you see three DISC priests fighting over shields on people, like they don't realize their own stupidity, that said HOLY has awesome CD, which sadly thanks to DISC being overpowered are never used, cause nobody and their mother plays full-time HOLY.</div></div><hr />

Hunters, youve recieved buffs after buffs after buffs. please.... you can run and shoot your most powerfull shots with next to 0 penalties. you cant be caught without dealing lethal damage first.<br />

warriors are still recieving the beltwhips but atleast they salvaged abit of second wind.... when were not stunned :p The new TFB is dumbing down the rotation of arms which i find to be a terrible change, it ruins the good timing gameplay we had going with the original one. and it kept heroic strike alive, apart from slowing with it.

Hm I doubt it, A meta gem is the gem which goes in the head whilst the socket we got from 5.1 was a prismatic socket for the weapon i think. Im guessing there might be another sha touched item, this time a head which you can only place this meta gem into or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Power Word: Solace has been replace with a new talent: Solace &amp; Insanity.<br />
•	For Holy and Discipline, Power Word: Solace replaces Holy Fire. It deals the same damage, and interacts with other spells and abilities in the same manner, but is instant, costs no mana, and restores 1% of maximum mana on each cast.<br />
•	For Shadow, this ability causes Mind Flay to gain the Insanity effect when it's cast on a target with 3 Shadow damage-over-time spells on them. Insanity causes Mind Flay to deal double damage for the duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's funny no one noticed that the shadow spec portion of insanity was not put in the right place in the text due to formatting error.<br />

And I don't think this talent will be taken by shadow priests even after this change. Maybe disc will like it - or Holy who theorycraft that the gcd is good to spend to get 1% mana back?</div></div><hr />

Maybe disc will like it - or Holy who theorycraft that the gcd is good to spend to get 1% mana back?<br />
<br />
Solace is extremely good for holy right now, not for disci that are still going with mindbender and casting smite on their pause instead of solace... because avarage damage+free heals is just plain better than low damage+mana-back<br />
With this change disc are probably going with solace too, if it stacks evangelism and heals like holy fire does... Not sure for hpriests: that 10sec cd is terrible.</div></div><hr />

I'm playing Warrior since the Beta of WoW (yes it's over 8 years already). But this time your tiny brains created the biggest bullshit and all other kind of shit you can imagine. Why the fuck you left Arms warriors with only 1 rage generator ability and 4 rage spending abilities? What is the point of that? To fully remove Warriors from PvP because some whining swines can't play even with OP classes? First TFB was with 5 stacks and then the whiners came: &quot;Oooo it's too powerful i can't manage damage like that. I'm being 2 shotted&quot; And then TFB was nerfed to 3 stakcs. But crybabies didn't stop. Then TFB was nerfed to 1 stack, but obviously it's still toooooo damn powerful for most of the noobs. That's why you decided to change the kind of stacks and put a rage cost. So now warriors are allowed to get 5 stacks of Overpower, but not allowed to use them because it costs 10 rage. I'm just wondering from where we should get rage to use these abilities? Just from a Mortal Strike and an autoattacks? In that case 2 of 3 rage spender abilities will be just forgotten. No one will spend rage for Heroic strike or Slam if we must keep rage for Overpower as well. I hate to believe that, but obviously arms warriors will be a class with only 2 abilities with average amount of damage and no chances of beating any other class.<br />
P.S. No wonder that every quarter year you get less and less players in WoW. Because more and more people are getting annoyed of your shit ideas for &quot;balance&quot;</div></div><hr />

developers really gone nuts..I'm really dissapointed, I always use to twink some level brackets when lvling my chars,now they gonna remove it cause of some whining noobs that can't afford atleast few herilooms?!<br />
damn whiners go do dungeons...ffs<br />
some bgs already giving like whole lvl in low lvl brackets, so scrubs now get it even more easy, gg blizzard... gg! finally put twinking to the grave!How is heirlooms related to being scaled to the max level for the bracket if i may ask?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because T15 will be out, and they want people to not do the T14/T15 split, like we most likely would?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marthsk</div><div class="date">2013-01-17, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you are saying that the 70 twinks are locked out and only battle against other who have locked they're experiene? Then tell it to blizz, if this is how it works out for 70's blizz should listen. But I haven't heard anything like people in level 70 with exp lock are banned for the other bgs where they actually have exp lock of. If this is true, I take back what I said to him, if not go buy a new life!<br />
<br />
When a character chooses to lock his experience, he is not going in the same BGs as those with their experience unlocked. They are competing against others who have their XP off, therefore choosing to fight against others who chose the exact same terms as he did.<br />
<br />
Before you go off on people, do a bit of research. Just because you're not aware of something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pizzapies</div><div class="date">2013-01-17, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The obvious fix to the BG problem is to keep the xp off brackets how they are making all of the twinkers happy, and going through with the change to xp on brackets. All of you saying the twinking requires no skill and its just running around with maxxed out gear have no idea what you are talking about. When you twink a character you are but into a separate bracket with other twinks, otherwise you would level out of being a twink in a few bg's. Twinking is an important part of the wow community reserved for those who love pvp but can't stand/or have time for a constant gear grind. i really think they should rethink this and in all honesty it probably will get changed before going live.</div></div><hr />

This is true but it hurts our DPS during the transition between having 2 piece tier 14 and getting upgrade from 5.2</div></div><hr />

Rofl........ So you just cancelled the Nerf for SW but telling ppl Just to stun us at 35% so we can't benefit from it at all so whiners can be happy and kill us with NO SW AT ALL :SSSSS OMG blizzard Well Done ... Really no comment on that..</div></div><hr />

Existing Malevolent items are unaffected.<br />
<br />
Please tell me that im misunderstanding this whole thing. Are they actually going to do this thing AGAIN?<br />
<br />
People with full s12-malevolent will have ALOT more stats than people with full s13-malevolent? Why the fuck do they insist on doing this?<br />
<br />
My fully upgraded s12 t2malevolent char will eat everyone with full non-upgradeable malevolent s13. Nice work, blizz :D</div></div><hr />

I mean, wth is so fun with being an overpowered twink oneshotting everyone else? No skills, no tactics no nothing, whats so brilliant about that? I don't get it??<br />
<br />
whats so fun about doing 90 bgs?<br />
<br />

<br />
What is so fun ganking low levels bad geared people in bgs? What fun am I missing out on. No skills not tacts no nothing. You sir need a life if this is the goodbye letter to the fun... And don't go around giving bullshit about being a 70 twink or whatever. When your a twink you are one, you outgear everyone else trying to level by bg. Go on the trade chat and whine there, then &quot;WTB NEW LIFE&quot; Or find a private server with only twink or convice blizzard to make a realm for twink and twinks only, they ruin the game for everyone else really. So stop whining and acuire some actualy skills.<br />
<br />
Did you not even read his post? or you just going on your personal history twink rage?<br />

No. The same rule still applies in that you have to be able to equip the item (both transmog-ee and transmog-er).</div></div><hr />

I also played warrior for 8 years and I not cry every patch aillor I do not play my warrior since it thrives in the live since I prefer the up my priest.I just hope he will not kill the shadow priest because since the temp is there between the nerve and manaburn billion and other cd, thank you ...</div></div><hr />
