Patch 7.2.5 - Developer Interview<br />
Vanion talked to Lead Encounter Designer Morgan Day about Patch 7.2.5. <br />

<br />
<br />
New tech is being used in the Kil'jaeden encounter, called Fog of War internally. You have limited vision, so you have to use the help of your allies to make your way through that phase. <br />
On lower difficulties, the team just may remove mechanics if they will have to be tuned down to a point where players won't care about them anymore.<br />
There will be a shortcut once you defeat Maiden four times. <br />
Raid tuning isn't done with specific legendary items in mind, just the power increase that comes from two legendary items. <br />
Mythic is tuned around the power increase from players having the Concordance trait. <br />
Normal or Heroic aren't tuned around having a specific class or spec. In Mythic the team tries to come up with multiple ways to complete a mechanic rather than requiring one class or spec. For example, adding a mechanic that requires either a spellsteal or mind control.<br />
Mythic only phases aren't required when designing final raid bosses. The team just does it when it fits. <br />
Titanforged and Warforged do give players a rare chance to get nicer loot, but if you compare a Mythic group and Heroic group, the Mythic group will have a higher item level. <br />
The team doesn't have plans to add a spectator mode for raids right now. There is a concern that guilds would recruit a coach and their role is to watch and direct the raid rather than play the game.<br />

Patch 7.2.5 - New Legendary Item Sources<br />
Blizzard shared some information about the source of the new legendary items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=23910&amp;filter-ilvl-min=910&amp;filter-quality=32) coming in Patch 7.2.5.<br />
Are the new ring legendaries a quest reward or just random drop?<br />
The new legendaries added in Patch 7.2.5 will be new drops, available through the existing system. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/869611706799882240))<br />
<br />
Is there a point in hoarding nethershards right now? Will they be usable for tomb gear once the tomb releases?<br />
Relinquished items purchased with Nethershards are not being updated with Tomb of Sargeras or Patch 7.2.5 and there's no need to hoard them. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/870700747427504128))<br />
But they will be able to proc the new legendaries right?<br />
Legendary items that are being added to the game in Patch 7.2.5 will not be obtainable from Relinquished tokens. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/870704885234139137))<br />

Elemental Discussions - 7.2.5<br />
Hey guys.<br />
<br />
So, part of the reason we haven't had much to share about Elemental is that we don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong with the spec. Most of the changes you've seen to other specs in 7.2.5 thus far have been focused around addressing core mechanical issues. We've only recently begun the process of making changes intended to bring each spec's performance more in line with the others.<br />
<br />
The bulk of the feedback we're seeing (in this thread and others) is that Elemental is fun to play, it just doesn't deal enough damage in certain situations. That's the sort of situation that we'll solve through what we generally refer to as &quot;tuning&quot; - e.g, adjusting things like how much damage a spell does, the chance for an effect to activate, and so on. Based on the feedback, those sound like the sort of changes we'd consider for Elemental.<br />
<br />
Note that how we define a &quot;mechanical change&quot; vs &quot;tuning&quot; can be a bit blurry, which makes it difficult for us to communicate things like this sometimes. Suffice it to say that changes intended to alter the way you play your class are generally considered mechanical, while changes that simply adjust how effective your class is in certain situations are generally considered tuning. That's still not a perfect explanation but hopefully it helps.<br />
<br />
Moreover, tuning isn't a process that's ever really &quot;complete.&quot; We constantly monitor class performance and make adjustments where we think they'll help, and fully expect to continue that in the weeks after Patch 7.2.5 releases. Additionally, it's important to remember that the effectiveness of your spec is measured comparatively to other specs; in other words, tuning down an overpowered spec is an indirect buff to everyone else. Sometimes - and I'm not saying this is the case for Elemental, because I'm honestly not certain off the top of my head - we'll decide that it's better to bring an outlier down than it is to buff everyone else.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the core of what I'm trying to get across here is that Elemental is definitely on our radar as a spec to pay close attention to as we continue class tuning for 7.2.5. We'll be keeping an eye on Elemental's performance as we continue the tuning process.<br />
<br />
However do you not think earthshock damage relative to our other spells and substituting earthquake in single target are possible design flaws?<br />
I can't speak to it personally (I just finished leveling my Shaman a couple weeks ago and I mostly stick to Enhance or Resto) but these are the sorts of things we'd generally look to address via tuning. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1063083-elemental-discussions-725/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753846038?page=17#326))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
What will happen with mithyc guldan mount? will still be 100% until expansion ends? or only until ToS goes up?<br />
The mount is a guaranteed drop until the end of the Legion expansion, and will then be treated like similar mounts from previous expansions. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/867790018428911617))<br />
<br />
Will we be able to cross realm Mythic ToV and Nighthold when 7.2.5 launches?<br />
Yes, you'll be able to form cross-realm groups for Mythic difficulty ToV and Nighthold in Patch 7.2.5. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/867788773303607296))<br />

Only bad thing about this affects mythic raiders - fights are tuned for higher gear that they should be. I don't think anyone would have problem if titanforging would stop with current heroic raid level.</div></div><hr />

Do you PvP? Toxic Blades will be better against classes that can dispel poisons, but worse against classes that can kite us out of melee range. I'm not sure what to make of it, especially since the talent went from a large amount of bonus crit to a flat % damage, and now they keep nerfing the numbers...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wont say its BAD, necessarily, but I can say &quot;I&quot; dont like it. IT makes non uprolled gear seem like shit and unrewarding. Hey, I just killed the same boss as you but I got a piece of gear noticeably shittier, it feels lame. That is why I do not like it, and would like to go back to the old way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly why a Mythic group does NOT have a higher item level, because of RNG. Mythic should have the highest attainable gear in the game and right now the system punishes those who try the hardest content.</div></div><hr />

Archimonde is dead dead as he died in the twisting nether. Thus he is no longer worth mentioning in the equation.

I'm really not looking forward to buggy as shit fog of war stuff.<br />
neither am I. Not seeing doesn't sound fun. It sure isn't when flying in broken shore with all of the fog blocking view distance, now it's coming to my raid encounter. I wish they would just do more challenging stuff with the environment instead of just &quot;what if you were just blind?&quot;, like Heigan, Thaddius(Platform changing), Operator Throgar, Hans/Franz.<br />
<br />
I'll give it a shot though, maybe the fog will be OK.</div></div><hr />

Well sha of anger(i think) had a similar mechanic and addons were useless in that maze.<br />
And touching on the coaching it won't work on twitch, ir has and inherent delay, i think it is at minimum 15 seconds so won't be usefull for coaching/calling. If it is direct spectating with do delay, that isue arises quickly.</div></div><hr />

And if you dont like coaching maybe you can add a delay but might be problematic with the tech from wow in mind.<br />
<br />
Yeah I don't get the problem with &quot;The team doesn't have plans to add a spectator mode for raids right now. There is a concern that guilds would recruit a coach and their role is to watch and direct the raid rather than play the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
They already let you practice the raids on PTR anyway.</div></div><hr />

Came back to the game less than 3 months ago, started with my lock and shes done the three easily. My two druids that I started around 4 and 6 weeks after the lock are both stuck around 810 or 850 ilvl. I guess its going to take at least another month before I get them up to 900 and able to possibly do any of the Broken Shore missions. Pretty much sucks tbh. They are all at this quest level - but have no chance of completing it for a long time yet whatever I do.</div></div><hr />

than you clearly DONT read the interwebz lol.<br />

Only bad thing about this affects mythic raiders - fights are tuned for higher gear that they should be. I don't think anyone would have problem if titanforging would stop with current heroic raid level.<br />
<br />
ehrm no. heroic players that got some WF/TF normal items and run endless heroics without any upgrades want have a talk with you. literall 60-70% of the community that spokes in forums HATE WF/TF, when you read diff forums on a daily base the last half year...<br />

The new legendaries added in Patch 7.2.5 will be new drops, available through the existing system. (WarcraftDevs)<br />
<br />
Why o why ? Are they ignoring us completely now . Not trough the existing system PLZ !!!!!<br />

there are enough morons that grind the hell out of them and pay blizz for that. RNG seems to work fine for blizz. so they just piss on their customers as long as they are stupid enough to do shit longterm and pay for it. what a customerfriendly company ... :)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure he's not the only person who has been hoping for that one legendary since the xpac started who is going to be saddened by this. I don't understand why blizzard keeps making these mechanics be more and more frustrating, is there anyone who likes this? Please let me know if you're the person who thinks this is fun, because I haven't met anyone yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note to self: Also, why the hell isn't that already being done and why aren't I doing it?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailylia</div><div class="date">2017-06-05, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because there is lag to streaming, and to be an effective &quot;coach&quot; you'd have to see things in realtime.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoldor</div><div class="date">2017-06-05, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coaching already happens, and anyone worried about stream lag, even then you can coach. Or even better be in the same room with one of the players! Magic I know. But coaching with minor lag isn't that much of an issue you can still call out timers a head of time etc. Simple stuff. I don't mind coaching for PvE, for PvP I totally understand how that can be bad. Especially if you get a ghost spectator that can move about the map for RBG.</div></div><hr />

There are countless VOIPs that aren't Discord that do live, there are numerous streaming sites that not only let you do real-time but also allow you to only let select people in with passwords. And who's Blizzard to watch you during a fight and go, &quot;We think you're coaching, but we don't have proof, but it's not cool to do&quot;?</div></div><hr />

That was my comment - KJ's voice is just some dude with heavy filters on it. Fan video level stuff. His voice should be a hell of a lot more powerful than that. <br />
<br />
It's my fault for not playing legion at all, but I thought Velen was heading for Argus, what's he doing on a spaceship in the nether?</div></div><hr />

IT makes non uprolled gear seem like shit and unrewarding. Hey, I just killed the same boss as you but I got a piece of gear noticeably shittier, it feels lame. That is why I do not like it, and would like to go back to the old way.<br />
<br />
This.<br />
People getting burned out by clearing the one raid on 4 difficulties because lolol 925 loot drops from lfr. It's not a just a case of &quot;oh boohoo u mythic raiders are just mad kids in lfr have 925 DoS or some shit&quot; <br />
It's not rewarding to clear mythic guldan and still be sitting in my 900 ilvl raid finder tier lmfao. Or hey clear 10/10M get no upgrades, go do a normal get multiple 920 pieces of loot lol. Or to still be doing mythic EN on a weekly basis praying to rngesus that your bis trinket drops tf or even wf. I didn't mind the wf system as that was rather minimal but there needs to be a line drawn somewhere.</div></div><hr />
