Cataclysm details in PC Gamer UK

Cataclysm details in PC Gamer UK<br />
PC Gamer UK (http://www.computerandvideogames.com/sites/pcgamer/) published a few more details on Cataclysm in this month's issue. I could threaten a few people from the UK to get that article or just link to WoW.com's article (http://www.wow.com/2009/09/27/cataclysm-starting-zone-lore-and-other-new-details-revealed/) and keep the interesting parts because they did all the work. <br />
<br />
If you saw the pre-Blizzcon leak (World of Warcraft - Cataclysm (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/)) you might recognize a few things here. <br />
<br />
Garrosh is confirmed to be the new leader of the Horde. He has redesigned Orgrimmar and the Taurens and Orcs are the only races allowed in the center of the city because they're the only ones strong enough to defend it. <br />
The Ruins of Lordaeron / Undercity will be expanded with a pit opening into the Undercity.<br />
Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale will be changed to a Warsong Hold style base. <br />
Stranglethorn will be the most altered zone.<br />
Apparently Southshore wasn't retaken by the horde (it was mentioned during Blizzcon) but has succumbed to tidal waves. <br />
The new raids will be more like Naxxramas than Sartharion. (Probably means that we won't get one-room / one-boss raids this time) <br />
There are a few extra details on the lore behind the Goblins and Worgens starting zones, just check WoW.com's Article (http://www.wow.com/2009/09/27/cataclysm-starting-zone-lore-and-other-new-details-revealed/) for that. <br />

Night Elves Mages in Cataclysm<br />
If we allowed Humans to have Warlocks, despite them being shunned and only barely tolerated, then it's logical that we allow night elf mages to be active in the Alliance even if the folks at Darnassus are a bit uncertain about the situation. Like the Humans, they've every right to be cautious about the things they consider wrong, especially when these are being practiced by their own people. But it may well be that also like the Humans and their warlocks, the Night Elves might find good reason to not completely shun those of their kind who work with the arcane.<br />
<br />
Nobody at the Temple of the Moon is rushing forward with open arms to greet them; the emissary is being given the cold shoulder. Even if we'd like them to hurry with it, they still need time to work over the idea of the arcane being used by their people while representing them in the active ranks of the Alliance. But they're not exactly escorting him out with guards, either... (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/10920803141-serious-lore-problems-with-cataclysm.html))<br />

Blink<br />
There was a fix to Blink crossing terrain (such as indoor to outdoor) in 3.2.2. If you find situations where it fails, it's more helpful to mention those curcumstances than to just say it &quot;always&quot; fails.<br />
<br />
True bugs, like this one, will get processed more quickly if reported in the bug forum. But again, you have to be specific. <br />
<br />
[...] All rapid movement events on a client - server game are going to be tricky. Remember that in addition to having the client and server actually agree on where you are, we also have to bulletproof the heck out of that code to prevent exploits (anything from getting where we don't want you to go to outright hax).<br />
<br />
Charge and Death Grip work more often than Blink because they have another character as a target. Blink (and a few other spells) target a location. Elevation changes or terrain borders (e.g. the infamous Warsong tunnel) can make the movement check more complicated.<br />
<br />
The programmers did a lot of work on Blink (and related events) for 3.2.2 and more fixes are getting made even between patches. I'm just asking you to notice if it works more consistently without just falling back into the &quot;hasn't worked in 5 years, mages aren't a priority&quot; rhetoric (c.f. thread title) that doesn't actually give us information we can use. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20126976367-blink-will-never-be-fixed.html))</div></div><hr />

Wonder if player chars will be allowed acces to the center of ogrimmar - if not, i could totally see garrosh doing something &quot;less than noble&quot; in there - Demon Blood v.2? <br />

Okay, let me get this straight: You can't go to parts of the hordes main city if you are an undead, a troll, a goblin or a bloodelf... i mean come on, give us a break!<br />
<br />
As i play undead myself i think this is kind of ridiculous, and not from a lore point of view but just from the view of an average joe player. I chose to be a part of the horde as i created my undead and know i want to be able to enjoy the same as the other horde players (in the case tauren and orc)!</div></div><hr />

So. Seen this a lot already. The information seems to point to the fact that only guards will be orc/taur, while players of all undead races can probably pass through the parts of org guarded here[/list]</div></div><hr />

The very reason that High Elves and Night Elves went their separate ways was that the Sindorei practised Magery while the Kaldorei did not, as the latter considered Magery to be the cause for the destruction of their civilisation.<br />
<br />
Now, if Night Elves start to dabble into the Occult again, there is absolutely no reason why High Elves and Night Elves live in separate societies, no reason why the Blood Elves should be opposed to Night Elves.<br />
<br />
The Blood Elves may hate the Alliance, but if the Night Elves start to practise the Arcane Arts again after the Great Sundering, this is like telling the High Elves that they were NOT wrong for continuing to practise the arcane all along, thus there is really no reason why Night Elves and Blood Elves/High Elves will contiue to be enemies.<br />
<br />
The Lore was imho stretched to its limit already, when the Sindorei joined the Horde and peacefully co-existed with their Ancient Arch-Enemy the Trolls, but now the Lore is taking its death blow when we are going to see Kaldorei Mages.<br />
<br />
Really, I would like to see none other than Chris Metzen trying to explain to the community exactly what is the reasoning behind Kaldorei Mages. I understand Chris is responsible for coming up with most of the Lore, and his explanation might be at least a little bit more satisfying than the rather lacking latest Blizzard Blue post.<br />

BTW, I am a big fan of WoW Lore, and I have read almost everything that Chris Metzen wrote about it at WoW Wiki.

Considering that since TBC Night elves have been killing blood elves and vice versa (through pvp and through quests etc...) I'm not sure a simple &quot;sorry we were wrong about magic /hug&quot; would make up for it, so I'm guessing thats why NE and BE would still be enemies and as has been said before it's blizzards lore so they can choose how it goes and evolves the sundering obviously causes some Night elves to think that times are changing and that maybe magic is a great help against the new troubles emerging in azeroth. Not every Night elf is rushing to use magic in fact they've stated alot of Night elves still shun it and arent pleased with it but desperate times and all.</div></div><hr />

He said in his previous one he has about 50,000g worth in mats right now, how much do you want to bet this is just a ploy to raise AH prices so he can get the most for his money? And he's screwed us over in the process :(<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay.. everything is making sense &quot;lore wise&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is the point : people in wow are NOT just one mind.<br />
<br />
Blood Elves are not Night Elves are not &quot;high born&quot; are not Kael'thas followers are not High Elves <br />
<br />
the elves are fragmented because of a long story. Like.. real life humans.<br />
<br />
and you can add independent elves, doing anything they want, maybe they were common high elve/night elve/blood elve whatever but they decided to live separately or not politically involved.<br />
<br />
in warcraft, blizzard choose _consciously_ to not restrict EVERY individuals of a people (trolls, gnome , elves, humans) under only ONE mind.<br />
<br />
so, now, when you read quests and dialogs, you learn some elves, the Shen'dralar, (not blood elves neither high elves want to work with Darnassus because they think something will happened and now it's time to be reunited with their own people.<br />
<br />
These old high borns didn't follow the first king of the exiled elves to the sea) living in Athenaeum. They never quit magic, you already have seen them in Warcraft for years. it's not new lore.<br />
<br />
but things are changing, story continue, lore is evolving, now the Shen'dralar want to join night elves.<br />
<br />
if you play a &quot;night elve mage&quot;, in fact he will be an old Highborne or a younger elves choosing to follow the Shen'dralar teachings. Maybe his camarads will disapprove him/her, maybe not. You can imagine here whatever.<br />
<br />
Lore is not an absolute fixed thing. Lore was not ended in warcraft 2. <br />
<br />
-<br />
think about Troll.<br />
<br />
Thousands ago, there was mostly one empire and many tribes, all in war.<br />
<br />
with time, two empire, divided about religious issues.<br />
<br />
Now, trolls are even more fragmented. Even the troll played are not Forest Troll or Zul'amani troll or Savage trolls or whatever. They do not follow Hakkar, They do not eat people (it's written in wow, even if some players choose to deny that)<br />
<br />
Humans are the same. Gilneas' country, Lordaeron, the kingdom of Stormwind and now Theramore are not the same. They were not affiliated under the same banner. Theramore is not under the Varyan authority, but Jaina Proudmore. Even if she has strong link to Stormwind.<br />
<br />
Dalaran was another state city.<br />
<br />
-<br />
Alliance can change, frontiers can change, people can switch and so on. <br />
<br />
You should thank Blizzard to allow elves, trolls, humans, dwarf and others to have a rich background and not simply be &quot;all evil&quot; or &quot;all good&quot; like a stupid fantasy stuff.<br />
<br />
hey, sometimes you can even meet nice polite Ogre.<br />
<br />
-<br />
Wow is not race-driven (it's not simply good elves against bad trolls), but cultural driven.<br />
<br />
and, you can see people having hard decisions to do.<br />
<br />
When Blood Elves (there were named &quot;high elves&quot; before Keal'thas decided to tear all remain of the past) accepted Trolls, they never accepted Zul'Amani troll but Darkspear tribe (the one played).<br />
<br />
You could say Blizzard imagine in a fantasy world, elves can learn to make a difference between hard-cold sacrificial green trolls (zul'aman) and mostly caring blue trolls.<br />
<br />
in story and lore, you can see it's not always easy. Some people can not accept a troll can be something more and will always think whatever the troll, a good troll is a dead troll.<br />
<br />
the same horde can make a difference between not-minded undead and mostly civilized undead with a mind.<br />
<br />
-<br />
in fact, faction who cannot make a difference between a good guy and a bad guy, the Scarlet Crusade, are well explained as _bad_ : extremists.<br />
<br />
you can thank Blizzard for that.<br />
<br />
-<br />
Lore shouldn't be just &quot;here are the bad guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
in the end, no, night elves suddenly don't launch fireball in Darnassus. HighBorne try to be accepted again and explain magic will help all elves.<br />
<br />
they will be like the demonist of Stormwind : despised but useful. Is it immoral? yeah maybe, but World of Warcraft is a world at war (hey!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As someone else has already explained (though in another giant text wall, which is why I am choosing to respond), Night Elf Mages fit lore perfectly. The highborne did not all become High Elves and stop studying arcane magic. This is not a silly retcon or anything either. The Shen'dralar have been in the game since Dire Maul was added, which is the major settlement of remaining highborne. <br />
<br />
They are Night Elves who chose to simply leave the mass population of Night Elves (those of Darnassus now) and continue studying arcane magic. They now have come to realize that it was basically foolish what they did in the past and the split from the remaining Night Elves was needed but that time is over and they seek to rejoin the main branch of Night Elves in Darnassus.<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell, Night Elf mages still existed after the sundering, they have existed in WoW since vanilla, and them trying to rejoin the main branch of Night Elves makes perfect sense lore-wise. If you want to read more about them yourself I suggest reading the [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Shen'dralar]Shen'dralar page on WoWwiki.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Have you forgotten the Shen'dralar living in Dire Maul and practicing arcane arts? Hello, night elf mages? They already exist in-game. You'll just be able to play one now. <br />

Not all that is true. One reason you can tell is that they say &quot;Deepholme (the new Dalaran City)&quot;. Blizzard already stated there wouldn't be any new neutral cities come this expansion.

I'd wager Sylvanas just doesn't give a flying fuck what Garrosh thinks of her. I seriously doubt she has such self-esteem issues that she'd be worried about a brainless orc kicking her people out of the center of Orgrimmar (oh noes, there were sooo many there). The Forsaken are in Plaguelands, at her side. Always. They don't care. Plaguelands is her turf, and she attacks Gilneas because she sees it fit, not because Garrosh would force her. I'd say she had intended to attack Gilneas anyway, when Garrosh orders her to do so. I mean, Arthas is dead, Plaguelands belong to her, might as well show those gits that left her people out there to rot who is in charge of Lordaeron now.</div></div><hr />

No they're not. Not in WoW anyway. They've gone five years without barely doing a damn thing with story. Then they decided they wanted the Horde and Alliance to fight again so they brought in these bozos(Varian and Garrosh) to act as contrived plot devices to make it happen.</div></div><hr />

I liked WoW lore thusfar (apart from the Naaru/Draenei spaceships in TBC), but the way Blizzard is implementing Varian and Garrosh right now really sucks. The fact that Thrall allowed Garrosh to act like a complete moron uptil now was already a bit hard to believe, but him somehow managing to become leader of the horde is just over the top. Not to mention the stupid decisions he's going to make. <br />

<br />
<br />
Given the context of the conversation, do you really need me to answer this? <br />
<br />
He's given one quest for five years. Perfectly emblematic of how little they've cared about developing a well-rounded story. Now, with Wrath of the Lich King they've made a better effort at telling a story, but even still; it's only good compared to what it was coming from. Catacylsm seems poised to make a great shift to better storytelling, which is why it makes it extra annoying to have Garrosh at the helm. <br />
<br />
However, I'll be fine with all of this if they include some &quot;Thrall loyalists&quot; storyline that will culminate with him retaking control in the end.</div></div><hr />

When the time is right, players can join with Thrall and those loyal to him as warchief and proceed go kick Garrosh's ass.<br />
<br />
This whole thing about Tauren and Orc being the only ones in central Org... Sorry it makes little sense for a couple reasons. One, there are the rumors of Cairne becoming killed, possibly by Garrosh, or at least he arranges it. Maybe he sets up Thrall as the culprit and gets the Tauren to back him instead of Thrall? Who knows. Bottom line is I would like to know which of the two players will be following. Garrosh or Thrall? Or both?<br />

<br />
no, the reason having a target helps is because they can asssume that the target is already in a valid position. The key is that they're trying to make blink work WITHOUT enabling exploits. Spawning a new NPC at some set distance in front of you would require all the same checks and calculations that make blink work so terribly (in addition to introducing lag to an ability that's entire purpose requires instant results.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um. No, when an NPC is spawned it has the checks already in place to make sure it doesn't fall through the world and is in a valid location (bugs withstanding). To explain it even more simply; the spawned NPC would just cast a very fast Deathgrip on you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willjones410</div><div class="date">2009-09-29, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, another question I have.<br />
<br />
We know that the Goblin starting quests involve a string where you help save a captured Thrall from humans who are at least dressed in Theramore uniforms. The question, is he still warchief of the Horde when this happens or has Garrosh already taken over. From what I understand he was on his way to negociate with Jaina at Theramore when his ship was attacked and captured. That sounds like he was still representing the Horde.<br />
<br />
My guess would be while Thrall is trying to go talk about peace and getting himself captured, Garrosh will be taking control in his absence.</div></div><hr />

Not quite. He ceased to be a Night Elf because he practised the Arcane. Although it is possible for Night Elves to practise Arcane Magic, they stop being such due to their doing so:<br />
<br />
<br />
Though they started out as regular night elves, they had been transformed by the magic flowing through their veins.S&amp;L 76 Night elves foreswore the use of arcane magic centuries before and even built up great resistance against it. They could master arcane power, although doing so changed them forever. Once a night elf learned to use arcane spellcasting, he suffered a painful transformation that stripped away his native night elf abilities and replaced them with high elf racial abilities. The complete change occurred within the space of a week and could not be reversed once its started.WRPG 45 Although stripped of his racial heritage, his physical attributes did not change.WRPG 57 <br />

First off, are people still saying that Thrall is going to be the next guardian despite evidence to the contrary? Is there an actual blue post confirming that Thrall is the next guardian? If there is, I can't find it, so please help me out here.<br />
<br />
Secondly, this:<br />
<br />
<br />
The New (New) Horde<br />
Thrall will hand over the leadership of the Horde to Garrosh Hellscream, while he serves as a coordinator for both the Horde and Alliance forces in and effort to combat the new threat of the Naga and Black Dragonflight. Without Thrall to keep Garrosh in check, he declares open war on the Alliance. In the political upheaval Cairne Bloodhoof is implicated as a traitor to the Horde and murdered by Garrosh. Cairne's son Baine takes over as the new Tauren chieftan.<br />
So...Thrall simply &quot;hands over&quot; control of the Horde to Garrosh, knowing what he's likely to do with it. Just like that he turns it over.<br />
<br />
If that's true then Garrosh had better have one damn good trump card to force Thrall to lay it down, otherwise I call shenanigans on bad story writing and out of character lore! After everything that's happened so far in Northrend involving Garrosh, knowing where his mind set is, I refuse to believe that Thrall would simply give over and let Garrosh run things. Anyone remember that list of 50 better choices for Warchief than Garrosh Hellscream that was posted on WoW.com a while back? I'm sure Thrall was thinking the same thing.<br />
<br />
It makes more sense that Garrosh actually sacks him and takes control by force.<br />
<br />
And the tauren...after Cairne is murdered by Garrosh, still offering their support in guarding Org. Yeah. Asuming he's not a kinslaying traitor himself, I'm sure that Baine Bloodhoof would not be just a tad pissed at the guy who killed his dad. Not at all.<br />
<br />
Either one of two things need to happen. 1) People need to find better sources of information or 2) Blizzard's story writing department needs a cleanup.</div></div><hr />

You post Wowwiki links but do you even bother to read them? It clearly says the elves in Dire Maul are Night Elves, not High Elves. This was all covered a while back in a blue post from a while back: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=19595071756&amp;pageNo=4&amp;sid=1#61<br />
<br />
<br />
The screenshot has been linked several times in this thread already, but I'd like to reinforce that we're perfectly aware of the way Night Elf society has viewed arcane magic over the years. <br />
<br />
We are similarly aware that Night Elf Mages have been in the game since patch 1.3. Not all Highborne became the High Elves and Blood Elves of today. <br />
<br />
As evidenced in the screenshot linked, patch 3.2.2 begins the explanation. We're not ignoring what came before, but we are moving the storyline forward, and at times, that means change and a shake up in the status quo. <br />
<br />
Those are Night Elves, not High Elves.</div></div><hr />

Quel'Dorei/Highborne refers to both the ancient caste in Night Elf Society and those that became High/Blood Elves.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW Wiki Lore disagrees with you:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Highborne (aka HighbornLoC 17 or High-borne,MoM 66 — quel'dorei meaning &quot;children of noble birth&quot; in Darnassian and &quot;high elves&quot;LoC 113 W3Man 48 in Thalassian) were the upper classes of the Kaldorei civilization and the favored servitors of Queen Azshara. Despite their near-identical physical appearance, the ancient Kaldorei were already split across racial lines as night elves and &quot;Highborn&quot; elves.LoC 17 The Highborne were largely responsible for the War of the Ancients, and most of those Highborne who had allied with the demons and survived the war later became the naga. Those that allied with the Kaldorei Resistance before the last battle of the war evolved into the modern high elves. <br />
<br />
Today, they are obsolete as an organization as most became high elves after they were exiled from Kalimdor. Even the high elves are few in number because most survivors declared themselves blood elves after the Scourge invasion. One notable exception is the Shen'dralar, a holdout group against the Legion during the War of the Ancients. They were able to defend Eldre'Thalas (Dire Maul) but became isolated from the rest of night elf society.<br />
<br />
It can be inferred from the above that:<br />
<br />
a. The Quel`Dorei are racially separated from the Keldorei, thus they no longer are Night Elves.<br />
<br />
b. The Blood Elves are different than the Highborne/High Elves, thus the different name in Lore i.e. Sin`Dorei.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Shen'dralar are an obscure and secretive faction of Highborne who dwell in The Athenaeum within Dire Maul. They are a remnant of the Quel'dorei elves who once populated Dire Maul, or Eldre'Thalas, as it was known in antiquity. Though insular and largely forgotten by the outside world, they are still wise and knowledgeable about a great many secrets including, tantalizingly, the location of the Ashbringer.[1] <br />

These are Highborne/High Elves. Not Night Elves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are incorrect. <br />
<br />
The Highborne in Dire Maul are meant to be Night Elves because they are, in fact, Night Elves. Not all Highborne crossed the sea or fell beneath it.<br />
<br />
<br />
To clarify one last time: <br />
<br />
High Elves were Highborne at one point. Not all Highborne became High Elves and Naga. <br />
<br />
The long, eventual evolution of the High Elves does not automatically occur if one uses arcane magic. <br />
<br />
Concerning models, you are forgetting one key factor in Dire Maul: that there is a Blood Elf in the east wing, and that she used the old Blood Elf model before Burning Crusade. Had we wanted the other NPCs in Dire Maul to be High Elves, they would have been. They are Night Elves. <br />
<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/diremaul.html <br />
<br />
The preview page, written just before patch 1.3 a few years ago, mentions that they are Night Elves. High Elves are not mentioned. <br />
<br />
I would understand the frustration if this were a retcon, but this is not. This is simply a matter of someone being mistaken in their knowledge of the lore.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for posting these. Hadn`t seen them. The fact remains that the Shen`Dralar were not Kaldorei they were Quel`Dorei. As WoW Wiki says, the Highborne (Quel`Dorei) were not the same with the Kaldorei (Night Elves). At some point they decided that the Quel`Dorei of Dire Maul were `Night Elves who had not become High Elves` although as WoW Wiki says `Quel`Dorei means High Elf in Thalassian`.<br />
<br />
So in essense, they are saying that: <br />
<br />
There are `High Elves who never stopped being Night Elves and that they are in fact Night Elves despite their very tribal name meaning High Elves`.<br />
<br />
Go figure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lore-wise, the Orcs love him, and it looks like the Tauren might cozy up to him as well. Lore-wise, the average Horde citizen loves Garrosh because this is what they hear everyday &quot;Garrosh gains victory against Scourge and Alliance!&quot; They didn't hear about what happened at the Violet Citadel, most Horde (lore-wise) don't know his true nature. All they know is that he's leading the Horde to victory. It makes a LOT of sense that he comes to power, most people look at it from a reader's perspective instead of what the characters actually experience.</div></div><hr />

Because language never evolves, and words that mean one thing never come to mean another thing... Oh wait...<br />

If you want an example, I point you to the words &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;gay&quot;. And though this one is much more borderline in acceptability, though closer to the point... &quot;Nigger&quot;.<br />

<br />
The Highborne -were- Night Elves. They were the aristocracy, the nobles. They were &quot;high born&quot; night elves. Hence the name. When Night Elf society fractured the -majority- of the Highborne went on to be come the High Elves (Who kept the name Quel'Dorei to link them to their &quot;noble&quot; past) and the Naga, who went crazier more quickly.<br />

<br />
<br />
Now before we open up the debate on differences between Night and High elves just take in consideration that : <br />
<br />
Cataclysm is probably happening a couple of years after the ''natural event'' itself destroyed most of Azeroth. The first day you will step in the ''new Azeroth'' the wildlife will already have been regenerated, partially at least.<br />
<br />
Now, we know Worgen ''joined'' alliance with help of Night elves. Maybe their human racines introduced arcante into Night elf world. Maybe the fact that they were fighting the forsaken with Worgens and saw the forsaken were ''affected'' by arcane more than any Night elf could have imagined (due to them seeing arcane magic as evil or bad thing) they adopted it. <br />
<br />
Overall, it's bunch of ''MAYBE'' that we will have to wait have the CD/DVD of Cataclysm in our hands before we trully understand/explain it. <br />
<br />
It's strange that we had Azeroth...compared like Americas to Europe/Asia (in term of two big separate parts of earth). And then suddenly, out of nowhere, we discover Groenland (In between these two, north of them). There are holes in the lore, that were made by Blizzard deliberately, for a reason, to allow them changes in the so-said lore, and to us to go nuts explaining something made by a handful of story writers.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh is confirmed to be the new leader of the Horde. He has redesigned Orgrimmar and the Taurens and Orcs are the only races allowed in the center of the city because they're the only ones strong enough to defend it.<br />

Sylvanas Windrunner. Sure she was technically a ranger and not a hunter, but hunter isn't too much of a stretch from ranger.<br />
<br />
I understand the reasoning behind race+class restrictions, and part of me do not agree with the new combos coming out in Cataclysm, but it's probably not hard to explain away most combos unless you are a hardcore lore fanatic.<br />

You kidding me? they can't even wear shoes, that makes them so great?<br />

I would assume the center would be the new base of operations, and if so, what makes it so different from our current one? Thrall's Guards are the Ko'Kron, and they are ALL Orcish.<br />
<br />
Now, sure, the reasons for it is because Garrosh thinks the rest of the horde factions are pussies, but at least we don't cry in front of a fire for an entire expansion.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we'll get to kill him as Horde? Kind of like the Battle of Undercity against Varimathras? Thrall leading the charge alongside a vengeful Baine Bloodhoof and the loyal tauren, along with other Horde leaders possibly in a Horde civil war.<br />

The article mentions that the first few levels of goblin levelling are centred around the goblin city until the cataclysm hits at which point you are forced to flee via passage on a ship. Its during this voyage that you are caught up in a large naval battle between the Horde and Alliance and are shipwrecked on the Lost isles. At some point you then link up with Local horde forces who are on a mission to retrieve the secret cargo the alliance we're carrying so you Hijack a gyrocopter and along with the horde forces board one of the alliance ships. Once onboard you discover what the cargo is the Alliance were carrying. Its Thrall himself bound and caged. You then have to free him and once that parts completed Thrall invites the remaining Goblins back into the horde....<br />
<br />
So it seems to me that Thrall doesn't give the leadership of the Horde away to Garrosh but that the alliance capture Thrall somehow which gives Garrosh a clear reason to assume command in Thrall's absence and declare open war on the alliance.<br />
<br />
In other words the only reason Garrosh becomes the leader of the Horde is that King Varian Wrynn is a total dick...</div></div><hr />

Imo it was one of the few places in the old world that actually looked awesome, that jungle rocks, with the big lake in the middle and the beach on one end, booty bay is awesome. They should do changes to places like Descolace (Boring grey desert) Tanaris (Boring orange desert) Barrens (Another Desert) Arithi Highlands (A big field with a lot of spiders and trees). My point is they as the game designers have great imaginations and creative skills decide to do most of their modifications and changes to the one zone that actually has a lot in it in terms of content and the way it looks. I forgot to mention Gurubashi arena which is also amazing in stv. Seriously add some new content to those sh**ty wastelands that players alt-tab out of while travelling to the next quest location. Think logically for once.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joshmaul</div><div class="date">2009-09-29, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the subject of the capital cities...after reading the article, I came up with the following theories. Either:<br />
<br />
1)Greymane City will be unusable after flooding caused by the Cataclysm, as implied in the PCG UK article; worgen capital is the &quot;worgen district&quot; in Stormwind. Goblin capital in Azshara. Gnomes retake Gnomeregan (finally). Trolls retain Orgrimmar as their capital, albeit set aside in their own little section given Garrosh's apparent racism. Only two capitals added, balance is maintained.<br />
<br />
2)Greymane City, or at least a portion of it, remains usable as a worgen capital (and allows the rep hunters a chance to get some reputation with Gilneas), similar to how the eastern portion of Silvermoon is used as the BE capital. Goblin capital in Azshara. Gnomeregan is changed from a dungeon to an Alliance daily quest hub - they're gonna take it eventually, but not now (maybe in a later patch/expansion). Sen'jin, same thing for Horde (maybe turn the Echo Isles into a daily quest hub, if it wasn't flooded by tidal waves or something). Again, two capitals only, balance is maintained.<br />
<br />
3)Greymane City as worgen capital. Goblin capital in Azshara. Gnomes retake Gnomeregan. Trolls still stuck with Orgrimmar. Two capitals for Alliance, one for Horde. Horde QQ commences.<br />
<br />
4)Greymane City as worgen capital. Goblin capital in Azshara. Gnomes retake Gnomeregan. Sen'jin Village is expanded into a city that may or may not include the Echo Isles (I figure Zalazane is dead by this point, maybe the curse is lifted, etc.). Four capitals, two on each side. Balance maintained, but shit, that's a lot of flight paths to remember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But from a story pointy of view, I can see Garosh laying down the pain to the alliance in some vengence fueled fury. Meanwhile Thrall is travelling about hugging the planet trying to mend the elements. Some of this we already know. <br />
<br />
What i think would be interesting is to have Thrall complete his task(s) in a later patch and return to find the horde this blood crazed war machine led by a warmonger. Garosh so drunk with his own power, refuse to step down for thrall.<br />
<br />
In which case...Thrall will be forced to show him why he is the true warchief and either have us (horde) Invade org as either a raid or a phased quest to forceably remove Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

I have actually heard Horde players say that if the Alliance raided Orgrimmar to kill Garrosh, they would not defend him. I wonder how many others would do that.</div></div><hr />

Like Southshore, Grom'gol Base Camp is destroyed by tidal waves and the Horde move far inland and into Zul'Gurub, which, the city also has a back door to the Blasted Lands.<br />

One that involves `proving` your strength so that you are allowed in it.<br />

I think it would be quite unfair to exclude people, even if I don`t play Horde</div></div><hr />

Uh...No.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrosh Becoming leader is just a terrible Mistake. His character has barely any legs to stand on when it comes to how he's acting, and even if he did, he's just an utterly unlikable character. He went from whiny sissy in Nagrand to some idiot who managed to gain a strategic position within the Horde for Reasons unknown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, I'd sooner Elect the Blood elf Leader as Warchief before that poor excuse of a caricature. <br />
<br />
<br />
...and Hardcore Horde? Really, Really?</div></div><hr />

<br />
...seriously, &quot;the hardcore horde&quot; wouldn't be very efficient without cunning undeads and stuff like it.<br />
<br />
In my opinion this statement to only have tauren and orcs in OG seems quite nice to me, maybe (if it really just doens't mean npcs which isn't much likely) you'll find some people in silvermoon aswell, and with the new changes maybe the cities which are just nowhere are in the place to be then, would be great.<br />
<br />
Anyway...Garrosh seems to be a bad leader and it was Thrall who made a Hordy proud to be one.<br />
Garrosh is much like Tirion and you all know what that means..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muccamilka</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Garrosh seems to be nothing more than a brainless berserk warrior (like his father was), not even capable of strategic thining, not even capable of sitting down and BE QUIET FOR 2 SECONDS! I hope he doesn't really take Horde's leadership, that wuold be a BAD thing for everybody...<br />
So, if the first reason is that he's stupid, the second reason to hate him is that, as it has been said time ago, in the ensuing warrior against the Alliance (that's kinda boring...), that Mag'har bastard will kill Cairne Bloodhoof (our beloved Tauren leader) for &quot;treason&quot; (he will probably try to keep the Horde on a peaceful terms, as he always does)... :'( Well, I'm going to kick YOUR ass, you brown skinned idiot! Why should a tauren remain in the Horde now? Now that Thrall (the man that welcomed us in the Horse) is somewhere else and the one who's in his places slays our leader...??<br />
<br />
That said... I'm not only going to cheer Ally raids killing Garrosh, I'll probably open them the way and clear the obstacles...<br />
The mindless horde nightmare ended lots of years ago, and I find no reason to put it back in lore (and in the game). We're beasts no more, and I don't want to prove that japanese cartoons hair King right...</div></div><hr />

I think that's supposed to be something that happens. Also, hardcore Horde? I laughed. Out loud. You know, in real life. This is a good example of how the Horde can be just as utterly retarded as the Alliance, just in &quot;new&quot; and more &quot;exciting&quot; ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Chuck Norris won't need our help. He'd just stare at anything red and they'd fall dead. If that didn't work, there's always the roundhouse kick. <br />
<br />
See above statement for Saurfang except drop roundhouse kick, and insert cleave.<br />
<br />
As for Kanye, Thrall was the best warchief of all time, I'm just saying as I watch Kanye get ROFLPWD.<br />

I for one welcome this news.

<br />
I run two Blood Elves. The BE paladin was because at the time there wasn't another choice for pallys on the Horde. The BE priest due to the chanting buff and mana pool(plus she looks hot!).<br />
<br />
...and I'm still sticking around...I welcome the conflict!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thrall is in some kind of dept of Hellscream (like he says all the horde are in dept of hellscream to have free the horde from the demon blood + without hellscream killing blow thrall would have been dead, remember wc3 cinematic), so it's make sens to me if Thrall sacrifice himself to save Garrosh... and then maybe after that Garrosh will learn something and get more wise.<br />
<br />
Like his father Garrosh is the kind of orc that kill first and ask question later so he might charge like saurfang's son did.<br />

Of course, Thrall could be doing some sort of Xanatos Gambit by naming Garrosh as leader. He may want to see how well the Horde can do without him, while being saddled with a hothead for a leader.</div></div><hr />

It's amazingly astounding how people can misinterpret things. What it is saying, is that Orc and Tauren NPCs are the only ones found in the center of Orgrimmar. I highly doubt Blizzard will block off an area for the other races.<br />

And it's not like Thrall is completely going away...he'll be there in the background waiting to go &quot;Garrosh, you dipshit, NOW look what you did!&quot; and smash the bastard's skull with the Doomhammer (which, BTW, should get a graphic overhaul like Varian's swords have...twice).</div></div><hr />

I remember briefly, back in 2004, when the RPG part of MMORPG was relevant to WoW. Now I'm not sure what I'm playing. I still enjoy playing it but don't bother calling it an RPG anymore as there is so little consistency there it's stupid.</div></div><hr />
