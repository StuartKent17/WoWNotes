<br />
There is no penalty for streaming. They've started a day later.<br />
<br />
Limit was dumb enough to not farm a new lockout even with the nerf knowledge before NA reset and one day ahead to farm. Method farmed a new lockout. More mythic gear = more power = dead boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, it was a rather stupid move honestly.<br />
you got a week to see if your stats are big enough for the fight by continuous attempts, NA should never holdover if DPS/HPS is all that's lacking for the kill since it takes maybe one hour two tops to clear farm content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The penalty for Method is Limit get to farm gear and have that days raid with a bigger power increase, where method has to wait 24 hours later before them power upgrades are able to be acquired for Method. If the resets were at the same time, Method would of killed is yesterday.<br />
<br />
Why lost Limit the race is not re-farming on mythic the and extending, they lost potentially huge upgrades. Look at Method just by farming today before the kill on mythic, the guild gained 4 Ilvls, thats a huge power gain.<br />
<br />
Limit lost due to bad management decisions, as Method half expected to wake up to Limit 8/8 as that was what the Method players were saying after yesterdays raid before reset.<br />

It didn't take 180 days to clear the raid, it took people 180 days to reach max level and get together a team. I suggest you check just how fucking easy the raids actually are to players doing them these days on Private servers. :)<br />

Hell, in the seconds before and after the kill, they jumped from 120k viewers to 160k+ viewers, and that was Sco alone, not counting the others streaming on the team.</div></div><hr />

Maybe 1% of the playerbase can clear Mythic G'huun. Just stop. Just because Method cleared doesn't mean everyone can - there will be plenty of guilds wiping on him over the Thanksgiving break. <br />

You're mentally challenged. They wouldn't have that lead to begin with if EU realms would get the raid at the same time. Limit got weekly reset AGAIN but threw it away by extending their raid from last week. Limit failed big time. Use your brain.</div></div><hr />

I get that but when we see that a raid can be cleared in what 1-2 resets then it just kind of feels like they should make content harder so you have to farm for weeks and get everyone geared to even be able to clear. I guess akin to Vanilla raids perhaps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't create content based on how the best players in the world are going to clear it otherwise the rest of the players will never be able to actually finish it in a time that is reasonable. Have to realise that these are the best players in the world playing at a level that most players will never reach. They play 16 + hours a day during the progression race whereas most people raid for 3 to 4 hours a day 3 days a week. If a new tier took longer than a week then Raiders like method wouldn't be able to dedicate the time it takes to clear as fast as they do.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who watched them, knows they played 16 - 20 hours a days for 8 days. Most people commenting, admit to not even raiding, or even play wow. You are pretty much assuming that since the top guild can clear it in 8 days, the game are easier than &quot;list expansion that you struggled on back when you played&quot;. <br />

As per usual. Sad! <br />

Going by what the very top 0.1% of 1% can do after spending 16+ hours a day playing in a raid that's new =/= that's what the rest of the 99% are capable of. And I'm willing to bet that Method's players are not 100% done with the game in its literal meaning. <br />

<br />
They didn't. Not extending the lockout is the safest bet, because at this level of raiding, it's not the players their skill holding them back to down the boss, it's the gear. By getting another lockout of mythic gear, they took the safe route.<br />
<br />
Limit risked it all by extending the lockout while they had a 16 hour time advantage over Method. By extending they robbed themselves of the upgrades a fresh mythic lockout would have provided them.</div></div><hr />

You want them to play 16 hours a day for months?? How wouldn't the average guild that only raids 7-9 hours a week be able to complete the raid?<br />

I agree they need to do something about the faction inbalance but your 100% WRONG. The average player, much less the top 1% of the playerbase, are so much better at the game than they were back then.

I don't care about this e-celeb circle-jerking garbage either.

Not extending the lockout is the safest bet, because at this level of raiding, it's not the players their skill holding them back to down the boss, it's the gear. By getting another lockout of mythic gear, they took the safe route.<br />
<br />
Limit risked it all by extending the lockout while they had a 16 hour time advantage over Method. By extending they robbed themselves of the upgrades a fresh mythic lockout would have provided them.<br />
<br />
You never know, bosses could have been bugged, Blizzard might have fucked with one again and didn't tell anyone. They could have ran into major technical issues that drastically cut down there time. Even upgrades themselves may have been the wrong ones for the wrong classes. To many ifs ans and buts. In the end 1 stra beat the other..</div></div><hr />

Limit had every chance to get World First but they made some bad decisions. They can only blame themselves for this mistake. Method killed G'huun for the first time in the whole world and thereby got World First. The race was called the &quot;world first race&quot; and therefore, the guild who killed G'huun for the first time in the world won the race.<br />

If you make your own competition called &quot;who can kill G'huun with the lowest ilvl&quot; then definitely you have the right to say Limit won. But Method won the world first race and no excuses of ilvl etc. can change 'who killed the boss first'.</div></div><hr />

People will as usual make this to a competition between EU and NA. But in the end it’s 40-60 people doing some really good raiding. The rest of NA and EU are casuals who got nothing to do with this race.</div></div><hr />

See what I did there? Just let people be.

You're arguing in the wrong direction. If Limit had won and Method lost, I'd understand, Limit got an extra day, so it's not fair. But that's not what happened, Method won, and they started a day late.<br />
<br />
Also, how it is a made up thing to earn Method money? Please do tell, I couldn't less of a crap about the world first race, but I'm really interested to see your take.<br />

Addons are so much better, seriously the things you can do with Weak Auras are truly amazing.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the players had the tools of today and knowledge of the game, Molten Core would have been full cleared in an hour tops. That content was beyond brain dead simple compared to raids now.<br />
<br />
Looks like you never raided back then, when you needed pots, food (yes you need pots and food now but it took forever to farm em for raid nights), resist gear, actually had to wait to get gear (there was a dkp system for every guild), attunements, you had to watch aggro (yes aggro was a thing back then) and so much more</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grinding for pots and food isn't really a matter of skill. I'm pretty sure he meant theorycraft and strategy in terms of prepping, not basic raid consumables. Attunements were pointless busywork that added nothing to the game, and MC was gated behind a rep grind to even face Majordomo or Raggy, inflating the time it took for him to die anyway. You seriously think guilds today would have difficulty with &quot;You are the bomb&quot;, &quot;Decurse X infinity&quot; or &quot;Don't get knocked in the lava gais!&quot;? <br />
<br />
Fact is, compared to today, vanilla raids were very basic. The best players are better now than they were back then. I can almost guarantee you vanilla raids will go down extremely quickly when classic WoW launches. Now, that's not the same as going in without knowing the fights, but they will still need to go at them from scratch. Aggro back then was horribly implemented. All it did was hamper dps classes from doing their job, &quot;whee I get to stop doing anything, much fun!&quot;, if they got to play their dps specs at all. <br />
<br />
This just sounds like you're clutching at vanilla being the hardest because it was a broken, buggy, horrendously balanced mess and even the best players didn't have the strongest grasp on the mechanics of the game like they do today. And yes, I did raid back then, I have very fond memories of those times. But it doesn't change the fact that I can look back at it and realise what problems they had.</div></div><hr />

Either way Method did something new here this week by showcasing what everybody has wanted to be a part of for years that has an interest in the 'world first race', rather than watching a blank screen chat only on twitch or spamming wowprogress every 10 mins. Hopefully it gets more recognized for them or maybe Blizzard starts to take note a bit more. (After looking at what twitch numbers did for wow i wouldnt be surprised if it got a few people talking high up at blizz office haha $$ )<br />
Winning the race was the icing on the cake for them, Gz and good luck for the next.</div></div><hr />

10 years ago, back when you had to gear up and put effort in to defeat difficult bosses, you had to progress in order to complete harder and harder content.<br />
<br />
High end raiders in 2018 are not more skilled than they were in 2008, the difference is today bosses are tuned for a lower gear level so it's significantly easier to get the gear required for world firsts/etc.<br />
<br />
Here's an example, the raiders who just took down G'huun are not more skilled than the raiders who first took down Kael'Thas, the reason G'huun only took eight days after becoming available and Kael took four months (not even dying until after the next raid tier was available) is because gear is super easy to get today which makes progression much easier.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but when guilds raced for World First in Vanilla and TBC the raiders did put up a lot of time into the game, and everyone had alts as well for swap for mechanics. Differense now and then was that Blizzard didn't go in and nerf the bosses because the raiders were undergeared or didn't kill a boss within the first 24 hours. <br />
<br />
Method has put a nice history on how long the end-boss has survived since the raid got released: https://www.method.gg/raid-history/vanilla<br />
Majority of raids took several weeks up to a month until MoP, where first-clears was done within 1-2 weeks. It's not that people suddenly got skilled after MoP got released and afterwards, but rather that Blizzard has made the raids way too easy.</div></div><hr />

Have to realise that these are the best players in the world playing at a level that most players will never reach. They play 16 + hours a day during the progression race whereas most people raid for 3 to 4 hours a day 3 days a week. If a new tier took longer than a week then Raiders like method wouldn't be able to dedicate the time it takes to clear as fast as they do.<br />
<br />
I am not talking about making content based on the best players, I am talking about making it impossible for even the best players to do until they have gear farmed from other bosses in that raid.<br />

<br />
You want them to play 16 hours a day for months?? How wouldn't the average guild that only raids 7-9 hours a week be able to complete the raid?<br />
<br />
When method raids one day they do the same amount of raid hours our guild would have in weeks.<br />
<br />
Why would they play that much for months? I mean if they want to then go for it. I just think, and this is personal opinion, that you should have to gear most of your raid with gear from that current raid before you have a chance at killing the last boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people will.. Method is just the top 1% of 1%... They can bypass gear with their skill and time dedication. If it took months because of gear requirements people would complain about time gating the raid. And they did gear most of their raid with gear from the raid.. They did mythic+ which gives gear equivalent to the raid. I don't like how mythic+ gives gear = or &gt; mythic raid but that is how it is. Mythic+ on higher difficulties is probably harder than raids anyway.</div></div><hr />

Kinda depends on your definition of hard, yeah? <br />
<br />
Was it hard to deal with getting a couple pieces of loot per boss to equip a 40 man raid? Was it hard to spam one spell for an entire fight as some classes? Was it hard to manage threat? Was it hard to level up and earn enough gold to keep your skills and riding relatively up-to-date? Was it hard to soldier through a 7-10, and often longer, day leveling experience? Was it hard to do endless profession grinding? <br />
<br />
Or is it hard now to get enough AP to stay &quot;competitive&quot;? To grind out M+ to earn AP and gear? To succeed in the higher M+ keys that test every tool your group has at their disposal? With bosses that make every Vanilla, TBC, WoTLK boss look like a trash mod. To kill bosses with tight DPS checks, HPS checks, and/or oodles of crazy unforgiving and sometimes insta-wipe mechanics? To maximize your DPS with the extreme variance from titanforged drops, RNG procs, mechanics RNG, and everything else.<br />
<br />
The bosses took longer then because the road to them TOOK way longer, and just because the top guilds in the world with the best players beat them in the first 3 weeks, doesn't mean anything. Mythic G'huun will still be unbeaten on most servers going into the next raids. <br />
<br />
Idk how you can say players were more skilled then? the bosses were a joke then compared to now G'huun is a 3 times as long fight with less people and about 20 times more ability's.<br />
<br />
All those questions are subjective, and I left out so many things people consider &quot;hard&quot; from each point in time.<br />

Idk man. They're both hard in their own unique ways. But in no way are the players from TBC more skilled then todays players, considering most Nihilum (EU) guild players play today in top guilds. So yeah.</div></div><hr />

What is ironic is that this toxic behaviour is alienating the people who actually elevate his status. We all have encountered people who don't understand the game's mechanics, but to spew out that rhetoric is unnecessary. He also went on to say that casuals don't deserve to breathe... Really? Most &quot;casuals&quot; have families and treat the game as a hobby, and not a full time job. It's like comparing a grand master to an amateur. It just points to how immature and out of touch some of these people are. <br />
<br />
I will not be watching their streams or supporting them in any way. This game needs people with a little more patience, and less toxicity. <br />
<br />
Ironically, JoshPriest's father seems to not be too impressed with his choice to pursue professional gaming. He made a call to his father while streaming to announce his Ghuun kill. Seems there are deeper issues there which is driving his behaviour.</div></div><hr />

It’s purely based on racial abilities. If the Alliance races got the best racials for raiding then all the top Guilds would change to the Alliance. The players of Method spend tons of money on race changes to have the best possibilities for each fight.

I remember how it was in classic. The sheer amount of time invested into reaching max level, farming mats for proffesions and whatnot, getting together 40(!) people that ALL would contribute to the raid. The bossfights themself were not particularly hard, but a guild needed over 40 people commiting alot of time outside raiding just to step into a raid like MC.<br />
<br />
Imagine controlling 40 people, making sure everyone was ready. I remember my guild had people who didnt raid, they just farmed stuff for the raid team. Imagine something like that today lol.<br />
Most fights were just attacking with a few spells. 1-2 abilites to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Bosses were NOT harder in classic. It required ALOT more time to get your raid group ready.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure he meant theorycraft and strategy in terms of prepping, not basic raid consumables. Attunements were pointless busywork that added nothing to the game, and MC was gated behind a rep grind to even face Majordomo or Raggy, inflating the time it took for him to die anyway. You seriously think guilds today would have difficulty with &quot;You are the bomb&quot;, &quot;Decurse X infinity&quot; or &quot;Don't get knocked in the lava gais!&quot;? <br />
<br />
Fact is, compared to today, vanilla raids were very basic. The best players are better now than they were back then. I can almost guarantee you vanilla raids will go down extremely quickly when classic WoW launches. Now, that's not the same as going in without knowing the fights, but they will still need to go at them from scratch. Aggro back then was horribly implemented. All it did was hamper dps classes from doing their job, &quot;whee I get to stop doing anything, much fun!&quot;, if they got to play their dps specs at all. <br />
<br />
This just sounds like you're clutching at vanilla being the hardest because it was a broken, buggy, horrendously balanced mess and even the best players didn't have the strongest grasp on the mechanics of the game like they do today. And yes, I did raid back then, I have very fond memories of those times. But it doesn't change the fact that I can look back at it and realise what problems they had.<br />
<br />
Looks like you're just like him, never raided back then XDD, sorry kid but completing a full raid in less than 3 weeks =/= skill (that's a lot less if you just count normal)<br />
<br />
As you can see every raid after ICC/Wotlk has become a joke, don't give me that piss poor excuse people have gotten better when classes have been gutted every damn expansion, you have a metric ton of addons that play the game for you almost so don't even try to preach about raiding something you never did back at the start of WoW.<br />

Anyone that doesn't agree with you is a kid and didn't raid. Ok dude. Been raiding for 13 odd years, (started playing in 1.8 patch) but whatever. ex dee ex dee lol etc. You also might want to not to invalidate your own argument with your own logic. <br />

Here is your logic in action:<br />
You state people disagreeing with you apparently &quot;didn't raid back then&quot; and thus their opinion is invalid. Therefore, given you admitted you haven't raided properly since ICC, your opinion on the current practical difficulty is also invalid. See how this works against you? Get out of your own arse before you accuse others of talking out of theirs, mate.<br />

I've been raiding since Vanilla and you're right, Mythic is way more difficult that Vanilla raiding ever was. What made raiding difficult in Vanilla (and games like Everquest), was the fact that you needed tons of people and getting useful gear for all of them was tough, since there weren't many ways to get gear. There was much more leeway, though, some fights you'd finish with over half the raid dead! Mythic is much more precise, and each death counts. Add to that mechanics and enrage timers, and you've got a more complex, skill-intensive encounter.</div></div><hr />

LoL. I get your point about &quot;having addons that play the game for you&quot;, but back in vanilla you didn't really need any of todays addons except perhaps bigwigs/ct_raid because there wasn't much to keep track of. Mechanically any raid in vanilla was super easy, there were just bosses that required very specific gear on most of the raid members, which took a long time to get for 40 people. Or the case of 4HM where you had to get 8 warriors with 3 set.</div></div><hr />

Ok dude. Been raiding for 13 odd years, (started playing in 1.8 patch) but whatever. ex dee ex dee lol etc. You also might want to not to invalidate your own argument with your own logic. <br />
<br />
Here is your logic in action:<br />
You state people disagreeing with you apparently &quot;didn't raid back then&quot; and thus their opinion is invalid. Therefore, given you admitted you haven't raided properly since ICC, your opinion on the current practical difficulty is also invalid. See how this works against you? Get out of your own arse before you accuse others of talking out of theirs, mate.<br />
<br />
Moment to moment gameplay in mythic is much more intense and complex now than it ever was in vanilla or tbc and most of Wrath.<br />
<br />
When you already have people soloing MOTHER on normal mode, yea your points are worthless XD, but keep on trying kid.<br />
<br />
You literally have a dungeon journal that tells you what the mechanics are before entering the fight, that would be like fighting a boss in dark souls knowing all of their mechanics before hand you go &quot;man that was hard but I one shot that boss&quot;<br />
<br />
You're just salty raids can be cleared in a week of being released, if you think that is a badge of skill, please raid in classic when it drops cause I'm gonna enjoy watching raiders like you fail. &quot;But but where's my cloak of shadows so I can cheese this fight&quot;, oh it's gonna be glorious seeing people not being able to cheese through dmg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are joking right? You're using the one time exploit solo mother kill in NORMAL (and thus completely irrelevant) as an example of mythic raids being easy? <br />
<br />
You can't do it anymore. It was a unintended use of an ability. It was done once then fixed. &quot;People&quot; aren't soloing normal Mother. <br />
<br />
But hey, Reckoning Bomb was never a thing, right? It's literally that. Or does that not count because it was vanilla?</div></div><hr />

I want to remind you that in classic having to move out of a stacked group due to a clearly telegraphed debuff was considered the pinnacle of personal responsibility (baron geddon). <br />
<br />
If you think that classic raids hold any candle to the complexity and difficulty of today's raids, then you are sorely mistaken.<br />
<br />
Even in naxxrammas, which was the absolute end-end game of classic raiding, things like the heigan dance or moving polarities was considered really difficult.<br />
<br />
Both of these mechanics would be laughed at today.</div></div><hr />

I don't think so.. ;x Sorry for heating some fire here ;D<br />
Racials pushed every guild to horde in order to compete.<br />
But with this leaderboard thing coming into play and a title going to the x first guilds on each faction to clear mythic I'm betting there will be plenty of guilds switching to Alliance side again just so they can be top of that side of the leaderboard and get a the title.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no serious guild has had any issues with it whatsoever. Not even heroic guilds (whose equivalent wouldn't have set foot outside of BWL back in classic. Much less AQ40, much less Naxx) had many problems with that. In fact maiden was considered one of the easier bosses to pug in that dungeon.<br />
<br />
Back then people went barking mad over people not being able to move with the polarities in naxx.<br />
<br />
Even the Heigan dance made a return in WoD with the Archimonde mythic dance. But then this mechanic was only a nuisance at best and only actually became dangerous at all when coupled with having to pre-spread for conduits or meteor overlaps.</div></div><hr />

Yea that's why only 1% of the player base actually did naxx in vanilla XDDD, sorry your feelers got hurt if you think todays raids are hard cause they ain't.<br />
<br />
Lets look at their wipe counter <br />
<br />
Taloc = 0<br />
Mother = 8<br />
Zek'voz, Herald of N'zoth = 8<br />
Vectis = 22<br />
Fetid Devourer = 133<br />
Zul, Reborn = 27<br />
Mythrax the Unraveler = 184<br />
G'huun = 285<br />
<br />
Paragon wiped 500 times just on Rag in Cata, then you had the &quot;next best&quot; guild supposedly took them 3 weeks to kill Rage after paragon, but that's just a sign of easier raids right? XD, your logic is pretty stupid.</div></div><hr />

Who's wipe counter is this ? Method ?. I watched them raid and Ghunn was 1000 pulls easily. They did 285 pulls within the first day and mythrax was just as many. <br />
<br />
Also, I am realizing many of you talk about Vanilla but you didn't actually play so shut up about it. Here's some fact. <br />
<br />
1 - MC didn't get cleared for 3 months because you need to shut the fire before fighting ragnaros. You had to do a quest which required revered with MC, that takes 2 months to do. After that, you had to farm fire gear before you could even attempt ragnaros without dying. That was a 2 - 3 months process. <br />
<br />
2 - BWL required a good amount of gear from MC, which takes 3 - 4 months to get or an amazing group. MC dropped 2 pieces per boss for 40 peoples, it was an extremely slow progress. Let's not forget that everyone had to be attuned and BWL was a guild breaker back then. The second boss was such a crazy DPS check, many guild called it quits, especially since it was a gear check. <br />
<br />
3 - AQ40 had a server wide event that took 2 - 3 months for most server to accomplish, with very few doing it under 1 month. After that, you needed nature resist gear to even get pass some boss which required world dragon that everyone on the server would fight for every 3 days. Cthun was bug to shit for a full month before he was kill able as well. <br />
<br />
4 - Naxx, by the time that instance came out, most guild were disbanded from the previous raid and you needed to have accumulated gear from all the other places, since there was no catch up for gear. Either you had AQ40, BWL gear or you weren't getting pass many fights in NAXX. Very few guild cleared NAXX because vanilla gearing system was progression based and required a year or so of raiding. It was extremely hard for a new guy joining a server, to find a guild to raid when AQ40 came out since the requirement was at least BWL gear or extremely good player. <br />
<br />
People are confusing fast clearing with today's raiding. You can't, today they give people tons of option to gear so that everyone has a chance to raid. In vanilla, they didn't care about that, so it was a very elitist group. Today, you don't need to have raided the previous raid to progress to the next and so on. They give people so many option, to catch up and be part of the latest one.<br />
<br />
Stop acting like Vanilla was hard, it was super easy, the hardest challenge was getting 40 peoples together (that was easily the hardest part) and getting people who actually had the gear to pull it off. Most people used DKP like we did and some of our raider got full tier 1 and tier 2 by the time Naxx came out. An extremely slow process (took me 6 months to get full tier 2 as a tank who got priority but since wrath shoulder and helmet never dropped, it was a tedious process) and this is why people are kind of clueless when they mention how long it took guild to clear old content compare to before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is plain false. They said their pull counts.<br />
Apart from that, if you think a little about and calculate it, they never did so many. <br />
And if you watched the stream you would knwo how &quot;slow&quot; it was between trys because they discussed tactics. <br />
<br />
<br />
On the rest it's true. Apart from some exceptions throughout wow, today's raiding is the most difficult or let's say it another way, it is always evolving.<br />
<br />
Back then, expecially classic, it was way more difficult to fullfill the requirements to raid and to actually gather 40 equipped and somehow capable people for example naxx than the raid itself</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe this specific case is different, but in general the NA guilds do have an advantage because of the one day earlier release and reset.<br />
<br />
You are a fucking dumbass. Yes, they start earlier and it is an advantage. But EU starts later, gets to see how US are killing earlier bosses, gets to spend LESS TIME on BUGGED BOSSES, because they PROGRESS LATER than the NA Guilds. <br />
<br />
IT IS THE SAME FOR BOTH SIDES IN THIS REGARD. You can argue with side of the pie you prefer, but THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF THE PIE. NOT ONE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Limit is more skilled, it's their raid, not Method's lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best fotball team are the ones who pay least for their players, best f1 drivers are those who wastes least money not the ones who crosses the finnishline first. Nice logic u got there mate, Official or Unofficial Method were nice to Limit, letting them leech tacts from their stream, u should thank them for letting US get G'huun down at all :D</div></div><hr />
