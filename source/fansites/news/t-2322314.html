Beta Build Version Number Update<br />
This afternoon the beta version of World of Warcraft was updated to Patch 8.0.0 - Build 25338. There is no data or actual patch, this is just a version number that is mentioned on the patch server. It is likely related to getting a build of the game ready for BlizzCon.</div></div><hr />

There's this AWESOME cutscene that someone shot of Aggramar trying to stomp on us and trying to fight us from the Argus campaign, where they are wearing that Dragon head. Has Aggramar looking menacing, and then this derpy dragon head. I wish I had saved it somewhere.</div></div><hr />

No, since betas have a track record of 100% admittance from day 1, I assume we'll all be playing that instead..</div></div><hr />

8.0.0 on PTR won't be a beta. If 8.0.0 hits PTR it will be pre expansion testing not an actual expansion beta. Also there's no way it would come out just a couple weeks after 7.3.2 it would be much later than that. This is certainly guaranteed to be a build only for Blizzcon and nothing more.</div></div><hr />

I don't know the way Blizzard does development changed over the years and even more so in Legion, we may see the new expansion much sooner than you think!</div></div><hr />

Forgot the new speed of blizzard's develop process? If its a beta, will be the expansion release in the next year...<br />
<br />
And 7.3.2 will be rock because everyone wants to do antorus raid... 8.0 will be Just a test on blizzcon</div></div><hr />

id sort of pencil in a date around late jan to feb for 8.0 beta to kick off with the first of the youtubers and streamers given access + those lucky few plebs with things being buggy and basic probly slowly ramping up to a mid -&gt; late summer 2018 release</div></div><hr />

That may be correct but it will be a closed beta so very few players will have access to it. Blizzard won't do an open beta again after the disaster they went through with MOP. We're easily 6 months out once the beta actually goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what was it exactly about MoP beta that makes people say this? I didn't notice any difference between MoP beta from any of the others. It wasn't an open beta either. It was anyone who signed that they would stay subbed for a year. The only thing I recall happening there were some people weren't overly pleased about being held out until the last few weeks before release. But, the beta servers were just fine. I mean sure things crashed, but that was not unique to the MoP beta.</div></div><hr />

An open beta isn't very useful in terms of development (everyone gets to play it, servers are crashing more regularly, but the feedback remain the same as it would be in closed beta), and it kinda kills the hype of the release, as everyone gets to play the expansion before the release date, so the &quot;Day 1&quot; is not special anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MOP beta was open to anyone who purchased WoW for an entire year. So they were flooded with probably 5x the beta testers as normal. It made overall feedback very cumbersome to sort through and decipher what was actually wrong versus people saying &quot;It's broken&quot; because they don't understand what a beta test is.<br />
<br />
Plus the servers had performance issues from being overloaded and it made it extremely hard to test. With Legion they went back to waves of testers so they could trickle in as they needed to test things.<br />

<br />
Nah they specifically said the feedback was god awful because they had a flood of testers there only to preview the game and didn't understand how a beta works. Blizzard betas are actually for testing versus many companies that strap beta on to a stress test and everyone jumps in to see.</div></div><hr />
