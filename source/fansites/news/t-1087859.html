Patch 4.3.3 on Live Realms (probably) this Week<br />
The final version of Patch 4.3.3 (Build 15354) hit the Blizzard download servers and it means the patch will most likely go live this week. This build seems to be the right one (unless something terrible happens, as usual, but it almost never (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2628-Patch-4.3.2-Going-Live-This-Week-Or-Maybe-Not) does).<br />

<br />
This patch doesn't really have anything interesting for players, it's mostly a bug fix patch with a way to consolidate most of the Patch 4.3 hotfixes into the game files to display them properly.<br />
<br />
If you are testing the 64-bit client, make sure to remove it before the patch, as it blocks the update from working correctly. You can find the full list of files to remove in the support article (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/64bit-client-prevents-patching-to-433). There is no new 64-bit client uploaded yet, so you will have to make do with the old 32-bit client until an update is released. <br />

<br />
The only significant change is the refinement of the Scroll of Resurrection interface (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/ingamescroll.jpg). The new strings hint at the 5 unused invite limit being changed into a daily limit, along with the newly listed 100 limit (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/february/sor100.png) in Account Management. <br />
<br />
<br />
SOR_DEFAULT_MESSAGE - &quot;Remember the good times in WoW? I do, so it's time to come back!&quot;<br />
SOR_DISABLE_CHOOSE_A_TARGET - &quot;Select someone to send the invite to.&quot;<br />
SOR_DISABLE_NO_INVITES_LEFT - &quot;You cannot send any more invites today.&quot;<br />
SOR_INSTRUCTION_EMAIL - &quot;Enter an E-mail address:&quot;<br />
SOR_INSTRUCTION_SELECT - &quot;Select a friend or guild member:&quot;<br />
SOR_NUM_REMAINING - &quot;Invites left today: %d&quot;<br />
SOR_SUCCESSFULLY_SENT - &quot;Your Scroll of Resurrection has been sent!&quot;<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Hard drives remain expensive, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD, as the next generation is a while away and the current prices are fairly flat (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/february/ssdgraph.gif), with sales bringing the cost very close to $1 per gigabyte. <br />
<br />
New Ivy Bridge CPUs from Intel are rumored to be released in April still, so if you are not in a hurry they will be a nice upgrade from Sandy Bridge. The current motherboards should support the new CPUs. <br />
<br />
The new 7970 GPU from AMD has been released and can be had for ~$580 if you can find it in stock. The 7950 is ~$450 and the 7770 is ~$160 and overpriced for the performance. The more interesting GPUs, 7850 and 7870, should be here soon as well. New GPUs from Nvidia likely won't be here before April or May. <br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

The current client updating process doesn't have support for it. All you have to do is delete it, patch, and they should have a new client version up soon!</div></div><hr />

Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's how Deathwing looks in all the Blizzard concept art. I know because I just looked through the Cataclysm art book that came with the CE last night. The art team in game is responsible for him looking less cool than that.</div></div><hr />

First off, it is HUMONGOUS. I am a small female, but this unit is as large as my head. I have a Raven V03 from Silverstone (Case). It's a pretty large case. If I had not have had the version with the display panel it would not have fit. I had to offset one of the fans on the end so I could fit my RAM under it. Corsair Vengence . Those are the only warnings I have for this heatsink. It is so quite I can not tell my PC is running.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone building today should really be buying a 2500k. The 2100 is an okay alternative, or if you can do things that will take advantage of the unlocked 960T it is okay. The CPUs in that price range are not worth buying.</div></div><hr />

You dig through for D3 strings? 4.3.3 should add support for D3 realid, maybe even battletag stuff. going forward D3 is suppose to be tested with cross platform operation with wow. B13 of D3 added support for this, then 4.3.3 hit ptr i figured it would have echoed this support no? not relevent now,, but to support it in 4.3.3 would mean compatible with D3 at launch, without needing another wow patch. that's what i figured 4.3.3 was for (asside from teh stuff you mentioned)<br />

How about.. No? and fact is it did happen but in peoples imagination for how good it was meant to look. Hell, people cried about the Lich King being all over northrend, but at least he stood as we'd expect a villian to be, we saw him do shit and it wasn't underplayed, unlike Deathwing.</div></div><hr />

I guess if you're the average consumer defaulting to giving money to the evil empire is the most brain, er easiest thing to do. (Sorry, I'm really opinionated on this one.

Unless you are using the Razer Naga yourself, you don't know what you are talking about. I'm using it on a daily basis, where all 14 buttons is used without any problems what so ever. It will take you about 2 days to learn to use it. After that, you can't go away from it.</div></div><hr />

The current motherboards should support the new CPUs. The new ivy bridge is delayed till june as of todays latest news. main reason is that a lot of retailers are still stuck wit alot of unsold sandy bridge processors / laptops with sandy bridge (due to the trouble the sandy bridge had at start), and with this delay intel wants to give those companies time to sell their stock. This might hopefully mean a lowering in price of the sandy</div></div><hr />

That support article doesn't tell the full story.<br />
<br />
For every build we've had for the PTR there has been an occupying 64 bit client.<br />
<br />
It's just that they haven't worked out the bits in the back end to enable the 64 bit client to be updated once a new patch is pushed out. I've seen this happen on the 4.3.3 PTR - you have to remove the 64 bit client to get it to update properly otherwise it throws up an internal error.<br />
<br />
What the support article doesn't tell you is you have to go to a sticky in the Tech Support forums to find the latest version of the 64 bit client.<br />
<br />
It's not currently in the sticky for the 64 bit client in the Tech Support forums because , well 4.3.3 hasn't gone live yet. I suspect once they do so there will be a 64 bit client for 4.3.3<br />
<br />
That support article needs to be updated to tell people that if they wish to use the 64 bit client after upgrading to go to the tech support forums to grab a new version of the 64 bit client.</div></div><hr />

As I understand it the patcher will stumble over the DLL's in the directory and throw up an error. You need to remove them manually before running the patcher.</div></div><hr />

They should have removed the second pair of speaker and made only one pair with a higher quality.But the real deal breaker is the left speaker, the left speaker is attached only through a rca so probably it's only passive, thats what I think, the problem is that until the volume isn't at a certain level it doesn't work, so you have till 20% volume just the right speaker working, while the left one is off. I thought it was a problem with my speakers, but I heard reading on internet that every z523 has the same problem. It's annoying. You can solve it leaving the source volume (e.g. pc) to half its power, so you go always beyond 20%, but if you want max power or very low volume you have to adjust 2 volume controls and that's terrible.The strange thing is that there are so many good reviews of these around, while they are really worth only half the price, there is even a logitechz523review site that is clearly a commercial thing from logitech.After used them for a week I can say I agree with this review. http://archive.techtree.com/techtree/jsp/article.jsp?article_id=111312&amp;cat_id=573&amp;page=1 .</div></div><hr />

I just ordered the Caviar Black 1TB off newegg yesterday. The price was stunning at 129.99 and a better deal than amazon. You might want to add in a little part to your posts about using fedex over UPS when ordering mechanical drives. UPS deliveries are subject to a 10ft. drop and, even covered in packaging, can seriously damage a HDD.<br />
<br />
Something I noticed is that you don't recommend 8gb RAM in the lower-end builds. On any newer OS (Vista, 7, whatever apple uses), 4gb is easily eaten up. Kingston has 8gb DDR3 1600 OCs on sale for $50 atm.</div></div><hr />

Though I have to agree with a few comments in here that it's a shame, the in-game Deathwing doesn't reflect his artwork Deathing and I can explain it better then others have and in turn, what then others failed to get the point.<br />
<br />
Deathwing in-game doesn't have an evil aura. Yes, he flies round, burns things, comes in quests, but there's no presence to him. No 'OMG... *jaw drop* It's, DEATHWING!' just lol, gief achievement! Burn me in Barrens! *jump*<br />
An example to this idea is, Lich King. Yes he appears in cinematics, quests, much the same, BUT. Whenever he appeared, you felt his aura (ok, maybe the roleplay was annoying after several times :P) but the guy felt evil and his much bad juju was known on a far bigger scale. <br />
Same with Illidan and even more so, seeing him kneeling with the skull, was a sight to behold and his boss battle (though now it's just farming but still, it's awesome!)<br />
Deathwing, people farm him 8/8 and ok, fight, kill, loot? K, thx, bai. Not through any difference to any end-expansion bosses before but... he wasn't built up in the same way. Only in the cinematic where he chills in SW did you go, well he's a badass, and that was it :(.<br />
<br />
Yes, in-game constraints but be realistic and remember, expansions before had big characters yet they still managed to poke it's audience (and make them love/good-hate them) even just a little and with much less money and manpower.</div></div><hr />

The 2550k is a crippled CPU. If you are overclocking anyway, buying the 2500k makes a lot more sense. If you aren't overclocking, you shouldn't be buying something that is unlocked. As for Bulldozer...<br />
