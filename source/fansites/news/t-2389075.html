Slootbag (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/247365553?t=) had a live interview with lead encounter designer Morgan Day. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
While the first row of Azerite options gives one option per spec, some of these options will involve spells shared between specs and so would be an option for both.<br />
Azerite armor choices will be able to be respecced, but it is unknown how often.<br />
There is a possibility for one-off legendaries in BfA.<br />
Islands will be supported and updated post launch to be relevant the entire expansion.<br />
Tyrannical and Fortified affixes are being moved to level 2.<br />
The team is discussing the possibility of affixes that are &quot;kiss-curse&quot; such as the Rage Zone ability seen in Deadmines where mobs take and deal more damage inside of it.<br />
The group finder will be updated so that you can search for Mythic +'s by level.<br />
The team is happy with the item level of mythic + rewards in Legion.<br />
The team has talked about having &quot;ahead of the curve&quot; achievements and seasons for Mythic + achievements (completing a +15)<br />
One of the purposes of Uldir was trying to figure out how to kill an Old God without killing the host in the process.<br />
Raids will release on a schedule similar to Legion.<br />
Queen Azshara is the &quot;Gul'dan&quot; of Bfa, meaning she will likely be the final boss of the raid after Uldir.<br />
The best Azerite abilities and unique trinkets are found in Mythic raiding. This is the incentive to raid when tier is gone.<br />
The team wants to have unique abilities for each class and moments for them to shine in encounters.<br />
Raid encounters that require a specific class will only show up in Mythic raids.<br />
There will be another faction in BfA that has mini game world quests like the Kirin Tor in Legion.<br />
<br />

Wowchakra Interview with Battle for Azeroth Devs<br />
Wowchaka (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHivjZ3zgjo) sat down with the WoW devs to discuss Battle for Azeroth. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has some other ideas for the Advanced AI but wants to see how players react to it in Island Expeditions first.<br />
Anything implemented to NPC models (such as upright forsaken) could be implemented for player models in the future. There is nothing to announce now.<br />
There will be cinematic for the burning of Teldrassil and the Battle for Lordaeron.<br />
There may be more hidden mounts in BfA. The team loves watching the community come together to solve these puzzles.<br />
If the team adds an Allied Race that is defined by a certain weapon then they might add Heritage weapons for the race.<br />
Level scaling and the changes that came with it was a way to make leveling more enjoyable to new players.<br />
<br />

Vanion Interview with Battle for Azeroth Devs<br />
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/news/unser-interview-mit-matt-goss-und-patrick-dawson-vom-bfa-media-event-18120) sat down with the WoW devs to discuss Battle for Azeroth. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is aware of the faction imbalance of hardcore raiding guilds. They have some ideas on how to solve this, but nothing to announce yet.<br />
Racials will be adjusted if they are found to be overpowered.<br />
There are no plans for a sub-class feature.<br />
As you dive into the lore of Zandalari troll and Kul Tiran druids you will learn that their form of druidism is distinct from the existing races.<br />
Making cool druid forms is important because druids don't display their gear as frequently as everyone else.<br />
There will not be crazy big numbers for Azerite like there was for Artifact Power.<br />
The 77 days between patches was pure coincidence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffed Interview with Battle for Azeroth Devs<br />
Buffed (http://www.buffed.de/World-of-Warcraft-Spiel-42971/News/Battle-for-Azeroth-Features-Entwickler-Interview-Michael-Bybee-Ely-Canno-1253868/) sat down with the WoW devs to discuss Battle for Azeroth. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts will be up for testing on the Alpha soon.<br />
Warfront rewards will be updated over the expansion to encourage people to participate.<br />
There will not be a weekly cap on Azerite.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gamereactor Interview with Battle for Azeroth Devs<br />
Gamereactor (https://www.gamereactor.eu/grtv/369983/World+of+Warcraft+Battle+for+Azeroth+Morgan+Day+Interview/) sat down with the WoW devs to discuss Battle for Azeroth. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
Allied races are meant to feel like a prestigious reward for earning the faction's trust.<br />
Island expeditions are meant to be about the sense of exploration.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GamerBraves Interview with Battle for Azeroth Devs<br />
GamerBraves (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqZpSyv3_g) sat down with the WoW devs to discuss Battle for Azeroth. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
The team still believes that when an expansion first launches the best way to experience it is on the ground. They have learned a lot from Warlords and Legion's flying and will use what they learned for flying in Bfa.<br />
Survival Hunter and Demonology warlocks are the two specs that got the most reworks in BfA.<br />
There might be Island Expeditions in the future that have more than 3 players.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Xorothian Cultists Channel Cast Time<br />
Our good friend Simca recently posted an explanation (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2388940-Xorothian-Cultists-What-the-channeling-actually-means?p=49180191&amp;viewfull=1#post49180191) for the Cultists channeling that has recently been speculated about. <br />
The duration between the Cultists channel end dates is just the largest value of milliseconds the game can hold, and for exactly half of that time, the game masks the channeling cast from the player because it thinks the channeling time is negative. Blizzard is not directly controlling any of these values intentionally, as such any events &quot;connected&quot; to these casts is entirely coincidental, and the community shouldn't get hyped when they restart casting.<br />
<br />
<br />
This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Crabby: The Dungeon Helper<br />
Besides the yearly April Fools Patch Notes, Blizzard also made a few funny announcements each year. In 2011, Crabby: The Dungeon Helper was announced. This new feature would guide players through dungeons to ensure their success. This would be especially helpful in the new dungeon, the Tomb of Immortal Darkness, where it was always dark, and players could only see a very limited range. As it turns out this Deep Dark technology ended up being used six years later, on Mythic Kil’jaeden. <br />
<br />

<br />
Hearthstone: The MMO<br />
After the great success Hearthstone had, it was time to announce the new 3D game world based on the card game. Hearthstone The MMO would feature all of our favorite characters, and give players a chance to plunge into a World of War to face all kinds of foes. This announcement was of course the 2016 April Fools joke accompanied by the Frostdoge Clan faction set to be added to Warlords of Draenor. This new faction has new mounts, trinkets, toys, and pets. In return players just need to collect Chunks of Dogestone throughout Draenor.<br />
<br />

<br />
Remote Guild Chat<br />
A Guild Chat App was announced in 2011, with the promise of an app that gave players a chance to read and write in guild chat from their phones. This app also had a few cool features for its time, such as access to the in-game calendar to view events, and the list of online players. This was the first iteration of the app, leading to the development of the World of Warcraft Armory app, which had many additional features, and is still available for download.<br />

<br />
Scholomance Revamp<br />
Last article we mentioned the revamp of the Scarlet Monastery. Scholomance is the second dungeon which was revamped for Mists of Pandaria. The entire zone got updated art and increased texture resolution. Some of the bosses also got a complete revamp to their toolkit, and some got their position in the dungeon changed. <br />

<br />
Forging Gorehowl<br />
The Warcraft Youtube channel released a video featuring Tony Swatton and the forging of the Gorehowl axe. With Warlords of Draenor approaching, it was the perfect time to forge the most iconic Orc weapon in the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/april/thumb/gorehowl.jpg (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4814-Azeroth-Armory-Forging-Gorehowl) <br />
<br />
Street Art<br />
In 2016, a few urban artists from ARTtitude took to the streets of London to share some Warcraft art with the world. Four Night Elf themed murals war painted along Great Eastern Street, each with a different style. The artists were also scheduled to travel to Amsterdam and Paris for a murloc and orc themed event.<br />
<br />

<br />
Overwatch: Alive<br />
The second animated short tells the story of Widowmaker. When playing her on King’s Row, she will say “Ah, the site of one of my finest kills. That day, I felt alive.” This refers to the assassination of Mondatta, the story of which is told in the short. As with the previous short, we get exciting combat and special effects combined with a great story.<br />

It could simply imply that Mythic has a different loot table. It's not unprecedented that loot would change between difficulties.<br />
<br />
Also, they caved on the respeccing of armor, so everyone should be great with the system now. Right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was kinda clear for me that different pieces have different traits, but Normal/Heroic/Mythic version of same item will have same traits with only increased item level. This way they could make specific set of traits that are best for open world/pvp/mythic+/raids.<br />
<br />
I don't think Mythic raids pieces will have different traits than same piece on LFR/Normal/Heroic. It's same as trinkets, they don't make unique trinkets for Mythic raiding. Only difference is that Azurite armor is outside titanforging system - so you will have to earn it in mythic raid (personally I like titanforging, but I think it should go up only to current Heroic raid item level)</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Raids will have unique azerite pieces (probably unique traits) and trinkets (as always)<br />
- Mythic+ rankings were dominated by set bonuses and raid trinkets <br />
- Mythic raiders had the best gear on live, and they want to keep it that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lmao<br />
<br />
I think the level scaling is fine in essence but there really needs to be tweaks made. They clearly didn't test it thoroughly and the more you level, the more that becomes apparent. Some examples would be...<br />
<br />
1) I was leveling a shadow priest. By 40, the pace slowed to a crawl as it took several rotations to kill most mobs. By 55 I was falling asleep. Every dungeon I run, I check recount and if there's a shadow priest, he's in last place. This of course was around 40-50.<br />
<br />
2) Some quest mobs aren't tuned properly. Stitches comes to mind. Takes too long to kill and hits way too hard. Several instances of this have occurred in my experience.<br />
<br />
3) Forget killing rares in Draenor. It's just not worth it. It's possible but not easy solo and the reward is measly. For some reason, the experience reward for killing rares doesn't get higher as it should after 1-80.<br />
<br />
4) Dungeon bosses take too long to kill. They don't hit hard, it's not hard to kill them, they're just miserably boring. Standing there doing your rotation for 2-3 minutes on a pre-end game boss is horrible.<br />
<br />
5) XP rewards need to be buffed in certain areas. Mobs should give like 5% more experience per kill after 30-40. Dungeon bosses definitely should be giving more experience. Questing rewards are trash. I did 10 or so quests in Outland at level 70. Turned them all in. What did I get? I went from 65% to next level to 75%. That's horseshit. It took me about 20 minutes of work to do those quests and what I got was 10% experience. At this point I found out you can just solo BC heroics and fly to 80 so I gave up on questing.<br />
<br />
6) There need to be world quests everywhere. I'm not sure why they didn't add these to Outland, Northrend and Vanilla zones. Kinda doesn't make sense if you're gonna revamp the leveling system and ignore one of the methods people use to offset the boredom of leveling post-WoD. It reminds me of Guild Wars 2's system where you just walk around, do shit and get experience. It's fun and helps take some of the boredom out of leveling-&gt;dungeons. Add that third element.<br />
<br />
7) Group quests used to be very easy to solo. Now they're fucking impossible. There's a 3 person quest in Frostfire on Draenor. As a warrior, I was 2 shot by the mob. I get the desired requirement for grouping to do this quest, but 2 shots? There is no way that was tested.<br />
<br />
Kinda no brainers, but blizzard has shown a pattern of laziness and lack of throughput in the past, as well as overcompensating. There just is no middle ground with them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tkioz</div><div class="date">2018-04-08, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the summary seems off. What's been said is more like:<br />

- Mythic+ rankings were dominated by set bonuses and raid trinkets <br />
- Mythic raiders had the best gear on live, and they want to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
Okay that's fine then. From how the summery was worded it seemed like mythic gear would have different traits, which seemed at odds with their stated goal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fishoa</div><div class="date">2018-04-08, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">snip<br />
This new leveling is so garbage. It takes so damn long and nothing gives great experience except PvP: a win is usually 50% of a level at 60-80, also known as the death bracket, where alts go to die. Sucks that to get the +%XP PvP trinkets, you need to grind Gurubashi Arena and Darkmoon Faire Arena (13 times each). Nobody got time for that.<br />
<br />
All I've been doing since I dinged 60 is queueing up for Ramparts and Shattered Halls while at the same time queueing up for a Random BG. Pretty much doing the same as before, but it takes a lot more time and it's much more boring. Thanks, Blizzard. At least once I get to 72, I can grind Karazhan and get this over with.<br />
<br />
If I was a new player, and we sure don't have those anymore as everybody already played this game at least once, I'd quit once I hit level 40, as as you said, leveling gets real slow. Even if I made through 60, the next 20 levels are soul crushing because XP gain is severely reduced and players simply don't get enough abilities or talents as they used to in the 20-60 bracket.<br />
<br />
If the end-game is where all the fun is and lore simply doesn't matter anymore as it's pretty much fanservice at this point, why slow down leveling? <br />
<br />

Not sure where you quoted that from, but it seems to have been reworded above to generally say its an incentive for raiding, with the best version (ie. ilvl) coming from Mythic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silver Forte</div><div class="date">2018-04-08, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This new leveling is so garbage. It takes so damn long and nothing gives great experience except PvP: a win is usually 50% of a level at 60-80, also known as the death bracket, where alts go to die. Sucks that to get the +%XP PvP trinkets, you need to grind Gurubashi Arena and Darkmoon Faire Arena (13 times each). Nobody got time for that.<br />
<br />
All I've been doing since I dinged 60 is queueing up for Ramparts and Shattered Halls while at the same time queueing up for a Random BG. Pretty much doing the same as before, but it takes a lot more time and it's much more boring. Thanks, Blizzard. At least once I get to 72, I can grind Karazhan and get this over with.<br />
<br />
If I was a new player, and we sure don't have those anymore as everybody already played this game at least once, I'd quit once I hit level 40, as as you said, leveling gets real slow. Even if I made through 60, the next 20 levels are soul crushing because XP gain is severely reduced and players simply don't get enough abilities or talents as they used to in the 20-60 bracket.<br />
<br />
If the end-game is where all the fun is and lore simply doesn't matter anymore as it's pretty much fanservice at this point, why slow down leveling? <br />
<br />
$$$.<br />
<br />
I don't see how someone who's new, who knows nothing about leveling routes, boss mechanics, dungeon paths or really anything, and without heirlooms, could level to 110 in this without themselves being some sort of fanatic for grinding.</div></div><hr />

You could be respeccing it so damn option it's actually a pain.<br />

Still didn't go as far as was needed to make leveling properly engage your brain, but hey at least you occasionally need to heal yourself and there might even be a reason to interrupt mob spells now and then. Maybe new players that hit max level might have a real idea of what their abilities do, when they need to use more than 2 of them in total to level up. Though of course even now it's not like you ever &quot;need&quot; to use stuns or anything else to survive. Not really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sad to see they aren't really talking about a related issue, that pretty much all non-group content is embarassingly, insultingly easy even with bare minimum gear. Why the hell would you design a MMORPG where there's zero danger? Why is even basic challenge exclusive to high end mythic+ dungeons and raids?<br />
I guess maybe it's true, that the players that remain actually do prefer everything to fall over in 5 seconds, dungeon bosses or *cough* elite group rares to die in 15. Zero chance of failure. That's apparently the mindset of WoWs remaining playerbase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything outside of raids is just there to pad the experience, and tell a story. Jumped onto the alpha and even with the bare minimum, green crap gear you get you completely obliterate everything in your path. Fuuuun.</div></div><hr />

The best Azerite abilities and unique trinkets are found in Mythic raiding. This is the incentive to raid when tier is gone.<br />
<br />
Didn't they say that the same named Azerite armour would have the same abilities, just of a different ilevel? Are they now going back on that because if so that's shit. I don't want to end up farming the same raid 4 times a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
A piece with the same name will have the exact same layout of traits -- You'll be able to see it in the Dungeon Journal. No RNG!<br />
However, higher item level pieces will have more powerful traits, but Azerite attuned pieces cannot titanforge.<br />
<br />
<br />
So basically we have 2 scenarios : FIRST where the same item &quot;Chest of Uldir Farmer&quot; N/HC/Myth have the same layout of traits BUT going from N to Mythic will make these traits &quot;stronger&quot; like dunno, &quot;This Spell gives XY Mastery for 10 SEC&quot; from 50 to 150mastery<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
SECOND scenario LFR/N/HC have the same Traits while Mythic have different traits, stronger one.</div></div><hr />

I'm really hoping its the first because if it's the second... I really really don't want to have to farm for the same bit twice because of different effects. I mean you'd think the mythic one would be automatically stronger, but it doesn't have to be, just better on paper while the lower version might be better in certain situations. <br />
<br />
Let's say you get the Mythic Mage Chest piece and it has something similar Time Warp ring in Legion does. Awesome, used in 99% of raids, great effect... But everywhere else? Virtually useless.<br />
<br />
However the normal/heroic/lfr version has the same effect as Combustion, not as strong and it will be a lower ilevel but it's useful in a bunch more content. So now instead of wearing your high ilevel chest like Blizzard told us would be possible, you'll be dropping 15 ilevels for a different effect...</div></div><hr />

LFR/N/HC have let's say the Time Warp trait like the ring 100% the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT THEN on Myth Version you have STILL the TW TRAIT but with something MORE like, &quot;while affected by 2nd TW you gain also XYZ Mastery for XY sec&quot; or &quot;every time you cast this spell during TW that CD get -5sec&quot; etc etc</div></div><hr />

It's a chore to level and a tedious one at that. The leveling dungeons are garbage, the trash mobs have way too much health. Keep the bosses the way they are. I've leveled 3-5 characters with the new patch from 1-110. Draenor is utter trash, they clearly did NOT test this expansion at all because of how broken everything in it is. It's &quot;fine&quot; up until 92~ at that point mobs scale way too much compared to the damage you do. The leveling patch is NOT difficult, it's not even remotely difficult. The game was never designed to be like that in the first place. It's just *very* boring now. I don't find it fun to chip away three times longer on mobs while doing a &quot;kill x quest&quot; which is basically every quest in wow. The leveling is slower because of this, Activision wins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She's a fairly big lore character, so of course she has to be killed. Major lore characters are not allowed to last more than a raid, once they get in the spotlight. At least she'll get a couple lines of lame dialog and a death cut scene, unlike other characters, who simply get abandoned, once they start getting interesting. Hopefully she'll get better treatment than Ceiling Sargeras who's watching you...</div></div><hr />

<br />
M+ works now because your chances of TF are somewhat reasonable. Maybe 1/10 dungeons you'll see a 960+ item drop, and its likely not useful due to slot/itemization. With the further nerf to TF in BfA, M+ is not going to be worth the time outside of weekly cache.<br />
<br />
The reward schedule for M+ has been jacked up from the get go, particularly this tier. Getting 980+ relics from the cache vs. having no luck is a bigger DPS gap than getting aman thuls or not (for casters). <br />
<br />
If their pattern continues and they say, nerf TF chances by 30-50%, how many dungeons must you run to get upgrades over non-warforged mythic raiding pieces? I can tell you have ~ 40-50 +15s run across my character, and I only have 1 piece of gear I use that dropped in dungeon (950 crit/haste neck from VotW).</div></div><hr />

They could always go the route of us actually *losing* to Azshara and having her leave us to our fate, so to speak. She disappears, and we meet up again next expansion that will probably have some connection to the Void/N'Zoth/Azshara.<br />
<br />
Or, Blizzard does its usual thing and kills off Azshara in the second raid and then kills off N'zoth in the filler raid, leaving us with Sylvanus for our coup de lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The major problem I have with level scaling is the concept of it. With level scaling, what exactly is the point of leveling? It's just a make work activity before you're allowed to do end game. There's no sense of growing stronger (quite the opposite in fact), and becoming ready for greater challenges ahead. It makes no sense lore wise: after all, if everything scales, why don't you? It's just a pointless, dev made roadblock designed for you to shell out $60 to skip it at that point.<br />
<br />
When the majority of people finally realize that leveling is pointless, several things are likely to happen:<br />
- leveling will be removed from the game and everyone will start at max level<br />
- abilities will be further pruned to &quot;simplify&quot; the experience for beginners (the goal will be about 5 buttons per class total)<br />
- existing quest be converted to world quests.<br />
<br />
One may argue whether this is ultimately better for the game or not, but it is no longer a MMORPG at that point. For me personally though, the further the game gets away from being the game I loved, the harder it is to like (And for me personally, with another ground pounding expac, it looks like my WoW days are done for good).<br />
<br />
There were many possible ways to deal with the out-leveling &quot;problem&quot; that did not involve moving away from the game genre. For example:<br />
<br />
- Allow a person to scale DOWN to the level of the zone, and continue gaining experience gains at a rate the same as if it was level appropriate content. Make new achievements Loremaster and such for level appropriate clearing. If FF14 has a patent or something on that tech, then pay the damn royalties!<br />
<br />
- Allow a toggle for scaling.<br />
<br />
- Lock heirloom acquisition behind a max level character again. New players should not have access to heirlooms. Recognize that there are two types of players who use heirlooms - ones that want to power level, and ones who want to be strong and/or not worry about gear. Heirlooms should be reworked into two classes to reflect this: one set of looms increases experience gains (and buff the gains) but provides WHITE levels of stats, while another set provides BLUE level stats, but has no exp gains (or even nerfed exp gains). Let the players mix and match sets to what they feel comfortable with. Speed leveling should be reserved for alts, not mains. The answer to new players leveling too quickly is not nerfing the leveling speed of alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now you have a very good chance to get higher level gear from the weekly mythic+ 15 chest than you do from mythic raiding, especially when you factor in titanforge changes.<br />
<br />
Mythic+ takes so much less time and effort than mythic raiding, I cannot even begin to fathom why the rewards should be like this. If mythic raid base reward is 960, the mythic+ weekly should be 940 or 950 at best. Mythic+ should provide gear on par with heroic raids, with mythic raiding being a tier above everything else.</div></div><hr />

And that's fine. To each their own. I used to no life WoW pretty hard about ten years ago. Back then, doing all the main quest lines in an entire continent, exploring all the zones and getting revered with all the factions (plus whatever part 2 entails) would have been nothing, but at this point in my life I just can't be bothered. Some enjoy the gating and task based way of unlocking flying, but I just feel it's Blizzard's way of dealing with the redheaded stepchild they wish they could get rid of. I'd suggest getting rid of it entirely, but there's too much TBC, Wrath and Cata content which requires it.</div></div><hr />
