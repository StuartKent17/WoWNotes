Wrath of the Lich King Preview - Part 3<br />
A few more information from the previews and interviews on Worldofwar.net (http://www.worldofwar.net/n/413405/new-article-hands-on-lich-king-report) and IGN.com (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872790p1.html).<br />
<br />
World<br />
Northrend is Huge. It is larger than Outland by a couple of zones, and some of the zones in Northrend are bigger than the largest zone in Outland. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
The mounts available to buy in Wrath will probably be able to take passengers. These mounts will also work in the old world (Provided they are land mounts), so players can give low-level characters a ride! The new mounts will also be slightly faster, around the speed of the Armored Netherdrakes. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
We're not sure if that will be available from the start but one of the ideas is to give the players new mounts they can buy and allow these new mounts to be available for passengers. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413362/jeff-kaplan-video-interview-transcript/page2))<br />
Trainers and Auction houses will remain in the &quot;Old World&quot; (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
Dalaran wil be in Nothern/Central Northrend, near the final zones (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
The Ashbringer lore will feature heavily in Wrath (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
More details on Northrend and Vehicles in Part 1 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7288.0#part1) and Part 2 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7288.0#part2)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Blacksmithing may be able to put Gem slots on items that didn't have them before (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
All professions will give players something powerful specific to them, similar to the Epic weapons that weaponsmiths can make just for themselves (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
A new metal ore found in Northrend is Cobalt. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
The new cloth in Northrend is called Frostweave. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
The way inscription is going to work is you'll have a series of mats that you need to do and then you'll create a scroll that will actually do the buff of the spell in question. Each scroll will have a specific use, so you won't create a generic scroll, it'll be a special scroll that will upgrade this fireball to do this type of thing. Right now we're still trying to make sure we've got that kind of mechanic down. That's actually most of the work. Most of the work is figuring out how that all works, what the materials are, how that comes together, and once we have that, then figuring out what the individual spells are and what the individual spells are and what the effects are going to be is going to be relatively easy. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872790p1.html))<br />
More details on Inscription in Part 2 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7288.0#part2)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Lake Wintergrasp will have daily quests, and there will probably be a buff that effects the entire continent, as well as rewards from all dungeons similar to the Spirit Shards players can currently get from the Auchindoun instances when their faction controls the area. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
There will probably be two new Arenas in Wrath, one set in Dalaran, one in Orgrimmar Arena (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
In Wyrmrest Temple there's a raid instance similar to Onyxia's Lair where it's a small raid instance with a single encounter in the Chamber of Aspects (http://www.wowwiki.com/Chamber_of_the_Aspects). We plan to put a raid encounter in there and let you take part in that and initially we plan to go with one raid encounter, but if we want to expand the space and introduce other dragon flights we can do that through the Chamber of Aspects. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413362/jeff-kaplan-video-interview-transcript/page2))<br />
A raid encounter in the Nexus will let players free drakes and then fight on their back, allowing them to use their abilities. Bronze, Green, and Red drakes will be available and each one of them will have his own set of abilities. The boss fight is tuned around the abilities of the drakes and players will be able to pick any combination (e.g. 3 Green, 1 Bronze, and 4 Red). There's a boss fight that has lots of adds in it, and one of [the drakes] can apply this buff to a bunch of adds while another one can basically consume the buff and get health back from all of it and also assume a tanking role. So your tank is then healing himself based off of this debuff that another one is applying to everyone. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872791p1.html))<br />
Developpers think they didn't reward PvE enough in the Burning Crusade, and will try to change that in WotLK. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872791p1.html))<br />
Heroic dungeons weren't rewarding enough in BC, Wrath of the Lich King will change that and make player feel that Heroic instances have their own tier of loot instead of a few additions to the normal loot table. Expanding the Heroic Badge system will be a major step to achieve this. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872791p1.html))<br />
The Arthas storyline will play out through the patches as well. So Arthas doesn't die in shipping Wrath of the Lich King. Arthas will die in a content patch. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872791p2.html))<br />
PvE ladders on the official armory are possible in the future (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
More details on Raid &amp; Dungeons in Part 1 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7288.0#part1)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knights<br />
Changing runes won't be as prohibitive as talent speccing or anything like that, but at the same time, it won't be so fluid so that you're doing it between fights. We're going to hit some sweet spot between those two. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872791p2.html))<br />
Death Knights aren't restricted to swords, they can also uses maces and axes and dual-wield their 1-hand version. Obviously, they can't use a shield. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872791p2.html))<br />
Using a 2-hand weapon or dual-wielding won't change anything to the amount of runes (6) you can use. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872791p2.html))<br />
Death Knights will start off in a floating necropolis in the Eastern Plaguelands, much like Naxxramas in its current location. They will then go on to level in a dedicated area East of Tyr's Hand and the Noxious Glade, where they will learn more about the background of Death Knights. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413348/death-knight-report))<br />
A few more DK abilities<br />
Blood Presence - DPS. Increases DPS and heals the DK slightly when attacked. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413348/death-knight-report/page2))<br />
Blood Strike - Does an amount of damage based on how many diseases are on the target. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413348/death-knight-report/page2))<br />
Blade Strike - Applies disease to the target in addition to doing damage. (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413348/death-knight-report/page2))<br />
Mind Freeze - Interrupts spell casting (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413348/death-knight-report/page2))<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 2.5 ?<br />
&quot;We just released 2.4.2 on the PTR [public test realm] last week and that's just kind of a minor bug fix patch with a handful of small adjustments. 2.4.0 does represent kind of the last content patch for Burning Crusade and for WoW before Wrath of the Lich King comes out, and so we are talking about doing something in between when 2.4.2 comes out and when Wrath of the Lich King comes out but haven't decided exactly what that is or when that's going to come out. It's only a possibility at this point.&quot; (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872790p1.html))<br />
&quot;There will be no event to open the route to Northrend like AQ; the day of the expansion release, players can go straight into Northrend. However, a month or 2 in advance there will possibly be a large patch, similar to pre TBC. Players will get hints of why they will have to go to Northrend in this peroid, and this patch will possibly feature new talent trees and class changes.&quot; (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
&quot;Blizzard are planning to bring out cool new items for players to spend all their money on, BEFORE Wrath comes out.&quot; (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />

<br />
The German commuinty site buffed.de has also been invited to California and they said something about the instance &quot;The Nexus&quot; and some other stuff I haven't read about here:<br />
-It's the instance featured in the video and there is a group of andventurers of the players' opposite faction trapped in ice in there which will eventually melt and have the two groups fight each other. They also managed to get to the first boss which is a human mage who has quite a strong knockback and kicked their group into a pit from which they couldn't get out again (bug?). <br />
-They got about 21'000 experience for a regular quest<br />
-While there are quite a few ports in Northrend you will not have to wait for ships but you're able to just talk to some guy which will teleport you to the next port. This is not a placeholder thing as it was in early wow days but a feature according to Blizzard.<br />
-There's a quest where you have to free a prisoned guy, steal a horse and jump on the horses back, throwing bombs and stuff at the people chasing you. This might fit in well with the concept of mounts with multiple seats I guess.<br />
<br />
-On a side note: There was a reporter from some other fansite who asked one of the developers who led the reporters around where the Diablo 3 developers were located. The dev actually wanted to answer but after opening his mouth he closed it right again and only said that he isn't allowed to talk about that...<br />
<br />
They also have an English version of their page where their article is featured as well (shortened, though) along with a commented version of the video. If you're interested in it here's (http://www.getbuffed.com/getbuffed/news/blizzard-unveils-new-details-about-wrath-of-the-lich-king/?action=view&amp;unid=575) the link.<br />

Of course it is possible that we will see &quot;4x PvE set + 4x PvP set&quot; thing, but this is all I can think of. Basically when PvE gear is useful only inside of instance to get another tier of PvE gear and so on, PvE is quite pointless to do. Yeah some may say &quot;challenge!&quot;, &quot;I don't do it for items!&quot; and so on, but let's face it: you advance in WoW via gear, if it is not useful then I would say some part of point in game dies.<br />
<br />
P.S. I am aware that some classes prefer PvE gear in PvP (hi rogues!).</div></div><hr />

What the hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
If you think these are the reasons why they're not going to stick things onto TBC then I don't think I can help you. Criticism must have a base in facts, your &quot;criticism&quot; is basically disillusion bullshit. Adding a new cloth type to the game is hardly major and it is simply so you must go to the new zones to make the comparable gear. Same with the new ore type. Those are so minor and ignore the vast (99.9% literally) of what is being added in WotLK. Of course, you ignore this.<br />
<br />
The new arena in Orgrimmar is logical because its a place that has absolutely zero purpose otherwise. Blizzard will still need to make many changes to this place in order to make it work with arenas. It'll need to have obstacles placed inside, bug tested many times over, and properly work with the instance servers. They didn't need to add a ton of arenas and using ones that already make sense from in game is the first step they should have gone with. As for balance, do you seriously think they're not going to address this issue? Of course they are, new talents alone mean much time will have to be spent on this. On top of that a entire new class. HUGE resources will go into class balance issues. Will it be perfect? No, never. Never has any MMO ever been fully balanced in this aspect. Very few MMOs have even tried to make both PvP and PvE such massive aspects of the game. Even now games tend to focus on one aspect more than the other.<br />
<br />
It makes sense lore wise to keep places like the old capitals as main population centers. In the &quot;World&quot; of Warcraft they didn't stand around all day in Shat typing &quot;i r link tunderfury now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You likely also skipped over the line about Northrend being much bigger than Outlands. Northrend is on the same planet as the old world continents so it only makes sense that the look would be related.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing existent about the Orgrimmar arena is that they have a general idea of what it looks like. Beyond that they have to completely rebuild it for actual use, add pillars to hump, bug test walls corners all that bs.<br />
<br />
You don't have to buy the xpac if you don't think it's worth it, don't play the game if you don't like it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ohh and u only have 17xx arena rating u should l2play, then post again - thx<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you don't play and you don't care about WoW.....Why are you here? lol<br />
<br />
Posting in WoW forums means you care, even if you say you don't, you took the time to write your posts which mean you care.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, bashing someone about their gear/arena rating just makes you a completely moron. Specially if your gear/arena rating doesn't surpass the person you're bashing.<br />
<br />
new cloth = frostweave, wow innovative, why not stick with bc?<br />
<br />
Why would you want that, so you once you get to lvl 80 you can go kill level 63+ mobs in 1 shot and get free cloth? I'd rather have cloth that is hard to get, that's why tailors get free tier sets which last up to ssc/tk or even hyjal/bt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We just released 2.4.2 on the PTR [public test realm] last week and that's just kind of a minor bug fix patch with a handful of small adjustments. 2.4.0 does represent kind of the last content patch for Burning Crusade and for WoW before Wrath of the Lich King comes out, and so we are talking about doing something in between when 2.4.2 comes out and when Wrath of the Lich King comes out but haven't decided exactly what that is or when that's going to come out. It's only a possibility at this point.&quot; (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/872/872790p1.html))<br />
&quot;There will be no event to open the route to Northrend like AQ; the day of the expansion release, players can go straight into Northrend. However, a month or 2 in advance there will possibly be a large patch, similar to pre TBC. Players will get hints of why they will have to go to Northrend in this peroid, and this patch will possibly feature new talent trees and class changes.&quot; (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
&quot;Blizzard are planning to bring out cool new items for players to spend all their money on, BEFORE Wrath comes out.&quot; (Source (http://www.worldofwar.net/articles/413359/wrath-presentation-all-the-facts-none-of-the-fluff))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It would more be a patch 3.0.1 similar to how patch 2.0.1 added the new talents and what not before TBC.</div></div><hr />

It's easy as that, though that being said, transportation now looks like a potential market. On the other hand, this is good for couples and friends who level together. They can share a mount as they traverse uncharted territory, rather than having one person getting lost along the way and being split up. Like all new implementations, it's a mixed bag.</div></div><hr />

I think it will be fun and more social,like when your riding through content and asking to a lowbie where hes heading and dropping him off there , if hes going same direction.<br />
<br />
Will help everyone progress, why wouldn't u give someone a ride when your going the same direction?<br />
<br />
Plus if your going to raid an instance, it will be more fun to travel together and faster,ill ride with u and ill take a quick smokebreak or piss now...<br />
<br />
Many advantages to get those lazy bastards to the instances fast. Saves u 5 minutes of taking him with u, then waiting till hes back from afk.<br />
<br />
Should be even cooler if they allow a full group in some vehicles, lets do a heroic, everybody hups in and powns it lol.<br />

Travelling will be less boring and might become fun.</div></div><hr />

If it isn't broke don't fix it.<br />
<br />
Nothing in life comes free and farming emulates that. Collecting motes in tbc to make a primal was a attempt on adding spice to something simple. Adding to the game works. If you drastically change something old there will be a fraction of the community that will not see it as an improvement and will complain. It results in more work and delay’s the expansion and really no one wants to deal with it. So if you notice there is a lot of old ideas with new added ideas.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to defend blizzard. But this is something very small and its not game breaking. If its the same old stuff to you its clearly time for you to move on. Something I'd suggest if you’re still on wow forums even after officially quitting.</div></div><hr />

well thx for the normal post :)<br />
i rarely &quot;farmed&quot; in wow i earned items/enchants/gold through instances/quests that used to be fun, but anywhen it gets boring, but i don't complain about the farming<br />
my main point is they kinda release tbc 2 instead of wotlk ;) most things considered as &quot;new&quot; are features of other mmorpgs / reused from bc<br />
i didn't have the time for pve in my wow time so my only option was bg'ing - i saw like 10 new instances for 5-25 ppl - but not even another &quot;map&quot; for warsong / ab / eos / av its really annoying to farm sth youve already seen a 1000 times and this isn't even &quot;subject to change&quot; for wotlk - 1 new bg, 2 new arenas, really epic ;)<br />
<br />
yea i still read those forums, because i hope that wow will return to the innovative non-esports-orientated fungame it was</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forget the ore and cloth, there are now vehicules, new kind of quests (new mechanics), new lands (with very different settings, like an huge troll city for quest, not a little instances) , combat on mount (like the drake instance) and so on<br />
<br />
There are REAL NEW MECHANICS in that extension ! Why you choose to ignore them ? Why you will tell it doesn't matter ? <br />
<br />
FORGET the ore, ho my ! there are still a blue sky, like in ALL games for 30 years ! ARg the horror.<br />

it sucks to be you but you miss a wHOole part of the game. Wow is not fantasy counter strike with editor, whatever maps or what. it's a fantasy action roleplay game : locations matters, sociability is at the core of the game and yes, &quot;pve&quot; is the main part of the game.<br />
<br />
Yes, in fact I understand how Wow can't fulfill you. it's all logical. But you are not playing the good game. BG is only a little nice part of that game. not the end.<br />
<br />
-<br />
&quot;yea i still read those forums, because i hope that wow will return to the innovative non-esports-orientated fungame it was&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe we don't play the same game. I'm not a fan of &quot;esport&quot; or &quot;pvp&quot;, so I'm still doing raids, quests, rp, exploration and .. well.. arena never changed anything for me. I'm glad people is playing with pvp or arena. it's not my thing and I'm happy with that.</div></div><hr />

I don't see much adventure in playing people on the same maps over and over. I have games like CoD and battlefield for that because if I'm going to look at something over and over it better have eye candy. To me wow was built on a foundation of story and pve content and has wing to the house dedicated to pvp. There is no content in pvp and people will always see what they want too on these forums.</div></div><hr />

and im just complaining about wotlk because the &quot;new stuff&quot; seems old to me, for example the vehicles... i mean flying around with autoaim pressing 1 button doesn't seem to be fun to me...<br />
<br />
but you ppl are right, i didn't use the full features of wow, so i shouldn't complain, but maybe u will understand anywhen that there was no other possibility except pvp for me and some new maps would've been enough to keep me playing from time to time, anyways thx for the attention ;)</div></div><hr />
