<br />
An island somewhere off the shores of Northrend. A rock, hardly worth a second look. But as insignificant as it may seem, this is no ordinary place. A sound of thunder as waves crash endlessly against rocky cliffs; a sound of fury as swords clash on the blood-stained fields of this island on the edge of forever.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Isle of Conquest.<br />
<br />
The ongoing struggle between Horde and Alliance has turned many once peaceful (and some not-so peaceful) places into theaters of constant war. The Isle of Conquest is the latest such place, set to be the location of a battle of epic proportions over the island's precious resources.<br />
<br />
An Alliance and a Horde general are fighting for dominance, overseeing the action from the safety of their keeps. Whichever side manages to eliminate the enemy general first will triumph on the island; failure to protect your leader will bring shame, dishonor, and defeat. There is no peace accord here, and it’s an all-out war between the factions.<br />
<br />
Once More into the breach...<br />
<br />
Isle of Conquest, a new battleground scheduled to make its debut in the upcoming content patch, Call of the Crusade, will pitch teams of up to 40 players against each other in a massive battle over this small island off Northrend's northern coast. To win, your team will need to make use of the island's unique strategic locations including an oil derrick, a siege workshop, and a fully equipped airship hangar. You will deploy devastating siege weaponry on the field; Light have mercy on anyone caught between you and your ultimate target, the general holed up in the enemy keep.<br />
<br />
There are five points of interest on the Isle of Conquest for the factions to battle over. Each one offers its own benefits and strategic value. Which one will you claim for your side, and will it be enough to ensure victory?<br />
<br />
<br />
Capture Locations<br />
<br />
Consider your options before storming out of your keep to confront the enemy head-on. Spread throughout the Isle of Conquest are several capturable locations (as seen on the map), each granting a unique strategic advantage to your team.<br />
<br />
The Oil Derrick: Located on the northwestern end of the island, this smudge in the Frozen Sea produces enough black gold to run a thousand siege engines. Taking this resource garners precious reinforcements and a continuous flow of honor to the side that controls it.<br />
<br />
The Cobalt Mine: This snow-covered assembly, located on the southeastern end of the island, hides untapped supplies that must be harvested. Taking this resource grants reinforcements and a continuous flow of honor to the side that controls it.<br />
<br />
The Docks: The western shore's docks will further expand your selection of siege weapons with the devastating new Glaive Thrower and the Catapult. Unleash the destruction of the Glaive Thrower upon the walls of the keep, or launch your invading party over the walls to assault the keep from within.<br />
<br />
The Airship Hangar: This sturdy steel structure stands on the peak of Mt. Conquest overlooking the eastern side of the island, allowing players to board the airship docked there. This devastating weapon of war is capable of raining death upon the heads of your enemies and destroying enemy defenses. Once onboard the airship, players will find it comes equipped with parachutes enabling a strike team to drop into the enemy keep from above.<br />
<br />
The Siege Workshop: Situated right between the Alliance base and the Horde base, this siege workshop occupies a strategic hot spot. Seizing it grants the controlling party the ability to utilize an arsenal of siege vehicles perfectly suited to reducing the enemy keep’s walls to dust and ashes.<br />
<br />
Graveyards: There are five graveyards in the Isle of Conquest that are attached to different points of interest on the map: the Horde base, the Alliance base, an oil spill island in the center of the map (attached to the siege workshop), the northeast corner (attached to the airship hangar), and the southwest corner (attached to the docks).<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Objectives<br />
<br />
The Keeps: The Horde and Alliance keeps sit at opposite ends of the island. These citadels host four easily accessible defensive cannons set on the ramparts, capable of unleashing hot fury onto oncoming attackers. Additional explosives sit safely stowed in the base of the keep along the back wall. At least, they’re safe as long as they don’t fall into enemy hands. If they do, though, they can be employed to bring the stone walls down from within.<br />
<br />
The General: Holed up behind the keeps' massive walls, the generals command their forces from a position of relative safety. Should the keep fall and the general be slain, the Isle of Conquest will fall to the victor.<br />
<br />
Reinforcements: Isle of Conquest uses a reinforcements system similar to that of Alterac Valley. The clock is ticking and every individual counts. If too many of your comrades fall to the enemy the battle will end in defeat. Killing enemy players will reduce their reinforcements by one for each kill, Once your faction’s reinforcements reach their limit, so too does your bid for control of the island and the wealth of resources you’ve fought so hard over.<br />
<br />
An island somewhere off the shores of Northrend. A rock, hardly worth a second look. A test of strength. A chance to prove your might, to crush your enemies, to make a difference, a chance for endless glory and conquest.<br />
<br />
Will you seize it?</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they'll be able to iron out any problems like that while it's still on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

No new ideas, they just merged AV with WG.. Good game blizz, your lucky your auditory are mainly kids who don't think that much. I would on other hand appreciate some new ideas. Not to mention that flying vehicles were supposed to be in WG.<br />

Oh, comon. Sure they may add some twists, but in the end its the same. If you stealth into enemies territory, or getting there by plane.. W/E. It's like wotlk quests. New mechanic and all, but in the end, its same go there and kill that.</div></div><hr />

Don't like it? Don't play it, same with SoTA, Flame Levi, Malygos and Wintergrasp. Nobody says you have to do them. <br />

heck I hate healing on hard fights maybe blizzard should change that aswel, or I could just choose not to go to healing intensive fights....<br />

thats such a negative twist to your argument... in a sense, the whole game is &quot;go there, kill this, get reward&quot; ... if you simplify the game to that level, then everything they added after initial release is all the same.<br />

Wow, you are not bright your self, if you can't come up with anything else to do in quests then kill mobs.. Even blizz had few unique quests in endgame I enjoyed. But as said, except that it's pretty simple.<br />

Well nobody is stopping your inevitable return to Hello Kitty Online, so if all this killing has gotten you down so much why don't you take the step now before you make yourself look even more like a tool.</div></div><hr />

Poor argument, more of an insult. You should know better your self that a good MMO should not be all around killing in quests. While I don't mind it, its getting boring after a while.<br />
<br />
My main argument is that new BG is poor on new ideas, there is so much more you can do to make an unique BG, instead of merging existing ones, and add a twist or two.</div></div><hr />

I understand some people don't like them, but then don't use them. It looks like there's plenty of room for infantry in these battles. Be the one to get launched into the keep or dropped of the airships and let other people drive the glaive throwers and such.</div></div><hr />

Well why don't you go ahead and go the suggestion forum then, if you think you have such great ideas for BG's... I doubt we'll ever see a BG where the amount of /hugs will turn into a win.<br />
<br />
But hey, you keep it up mate. I come from Ultima Online where there were more than enough things to do beside killing but in the end it all came down to killing or working for those who kill. If you want to do something else than killing, really Hello Kitty is good or maybe the Sims; in all other MMO's you'll have to understand that killing monsters is the basic economy of the game and thus everything revolves around it.</div></div><hr />

Sure. Have this same exact thing...............................................without the vehicles.<br />
<br />
These nodes give reinforcements, right? Wait, no..they don't. They just add a little number on the top of the screen. How about when you get a node, it spawns some reinforcements every 5 minutes that help you fight. They don't have to be elite, the just need to have some minor influence on the fight. Maybe when you capture a node, these reinforcements will go and kill one of the opposing general's &quot;guards&quot;. They can be intercepted by the opposing faction if they aren't escorted and protected.<br />
<br />
There are an infinite amount of things they can do without vehicles, they're just taking the easy way out by adding more vehicles b/c they're &quot;different&quot;, instead of being creative.</div></div><hr />

Didn't mention anything about my own class, drawing your own conclusions is nice but the fact is that some classes have more viability in vehicles than standing around being strangulated and beaten down to the ground.<br />

Why whine? Because most people don't like vehicles. Because there are more creative things they can come up with. Because AV would have been absolutely terrible if all you needed was a tank to push across the Alliance bridge. <br />
<br />
If you're in a vehicle, you can't be killed by a single person. That's stupid. If you see someone in a battleground by themself, and you're by yourself, you should ALWAYS have a fair fight with that person. wah wah class imbalance, i know.

<br />
Have you ever played SotA?<br />
<br />
Vehicles have very little player killing capability because players can just stand behind them and kill them, even in Wintergrasp it's piss easy to take care of vehicles if you are a dps class. Using vehicles requires some skill aswel and in all honesty if any of the bg's were about playerskills it'd be alot different, it's about the skill of a group being able to take the right flags at the right moment, this of course is followed by a fight most of the time in which player skill does matter but to an extend you could go in EotS and be the most valueable player without hurting or healing ANYONE.<br />
<br />

Ok hwo about:<br />
<br />
The Style of Squaredance<br />
<br />
The Style of Squaredance is a new Battleground, located in Tempets Keep: The Eye. It is the secret hideout of Kael'thas Sunstrider, who merged after his bad injury, no he is not dead, with Juster Timberlaker a siphoning soul, who represents the Spirit of the new upcoming hero class: The Bard.<br />
<br />
The Style of Squaredance makes the expectations of both factions, Horde and Alliance true. It offers several new game mechanics, that will improve and change your gameplay totally. Tired of flagging flags? Tired of beating the hell out of the enemy's general? Tired of gathering resources or driving vehicles?<br />
Then The Style of Squaredance will be yours. <br />
In every part of this brand new battleground you'll find a competent jury, consisting of Jaina Proudmorre - master of freestyle teleport dance -, Thrall - Master of Break-your-Neck Dance and last but not least Crank &quot;da shizzle goblin wizzle&quot; Fizzlebub.<br />
<br />
Ok I'll stop now.<br />
<br />
There are basics, that are not meant to be redesigned. A game, that is based on war, fights and combat in general will ever be about war, fights and combat, especially in main aspects of the game like battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

Do the argent tourney quests, and read the quests. You will find out what it has to do with the game. Know something before you moan like an idiot. It fits with the genre, it fits with the lore of the argent crusade, it fits with the lore of the game.<br />
<br />
The tourney is to prepare champions to face arthas and the scourge. To raise morale after the few victories the crusade has had in icecrown (do all the zone quests for the crusade to see these victories). And many more reasons.</div></div><hr />

Context. How exactly do you propose PvP and Battle grounds to be anything but killing? Should horde and alliance pick flowers and battle it out at the azerothian bouquet championship? Perhaps blizz should make it a dance dance revolution battleground (Okay that would be awesome).<br />
<br />
The fact is you say the battleground sucks because it justs the same idea's go hear kill this get reward. But its not. Objectives are objectives for a reason. They add that unique and different aspect to the standard and always there pvp goals of Kill.</div></div><hr />

Parachute off airship, kill players with your character. Wow look at that pvp with your character. Do you use trinkets? Not your character. Are you a engineer (world pvp)? Not your character.<br />
<br />
Velhicles are simple another tool like gear, items, and pets are. Stop complaining about silly things and suck it up already. If you don't want to use velhicles to pvp don't use one. You can do the BG just fine without using any velhicle weapons to pvp.</div></div><hr />

Infantry can take down velhicles pretty easily in wintergrasp. Its not like WoW has physics where velhicles can run you over and instant kill you. The catapult is the exception because it is geared towards being a defense against infantry. But seige velhicles are easy to destroy.<br />
<br />

<br />
Because you aren't alone when in the velhicle. But one person can kill a velhicle so your argument is moot. Battle isn't about fair fight, if you want that go play mortal combat or something where you have a countdown before each fight.<br />
<br />
You don't fly the airship, you ride on it and use the weapon onboard, or you parachute off. And stop whining about something you've never seen in action. Your whole arguments are moot because blizzard can balance any velhicle weapon to not instant kill anyone. You are whining off your ignorant fears and assumptions because you are reaching for any reason to complain about velhicles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes because having an objectives you capture that auto-kill the other side is so much fun and different then &quot;killing&quot;. The thing is you are boiling it down to being AB and WG recycling yet its not any more then any of your ideas would be. Anything you could come up with won't be different then anything already used in WoW. Why? Because capturing things for objectives has been used, having things to gather to summon something has been used, having things you use to kill others has been used. You are hypocrit because you boil down wow to the &quot;Basic&quot; underlying things yet don't apply that to everything else that boils down the exact same thing.<br />

Sure. Give me few weeks, not even as long as blizz had, and I will come up with an ass kicking BG without having to recycle AB and WG.<br />
<br />
<br />
So no killing. No capturing anything. No resources. No buffs for objects. You'll be recycling something of them in any idea. Stop acting like that is bad though because its not. Good things get used again in different forms. You even do that yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah, and get steamrolled by a tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
That doesn't happen in WG, you can't be run over by a tank. And nor do tanks have insta kill players. Velhicles are meant to be taken down by both players and other velhicles so you are just whining for the sake of it at this point.</div></div><hr />

And to the people complaining about the vehicle use just stop it already really... you don't have to use any if you hate it so much, hell you don't even have to play the bg if you don't like it.

I'm just contemplating the lag issues that might arise from 40 ppl + vehicles. I mean sure WG has issues, but thats also tied to region wide IE Northrend latency. So hopefully it wont be that laggy, since its on the BG servers.<br />

The game is kind of based off the Warcraft games. Last time I checked they used vehicles in the game. Majority of the people enjoy Flame Leviathan since it's something different. You can whine and cry all you want, but you haven't even played it once or given it a try. Small group of people don't like the idea while the mass majority do like the idea. Sorry small fries, but you lose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What everyone is forgetting is that up until this point there have only been the SotA and WG vehicles we have experience with both of which are pure siege (catapults do decent infantry damage but no more than a geared player could put out). <br />
<br />
The only thing vehicles have going for them is:<br />
1) Tons of HP and when they die you still have to deal with the player who still has full HP<br />
2) Ability to damage structures (big whoop if the bg is designed around a reinforcement / kill the general system<br />
3) Caster passengers in SotA demolishers can CRUSH players<br />
<br />
Reason 3# is why so many mele QQ about vehicles cause were the ones who have to drive them feeling like chuffers for the mages / ele shamans who get to blow the crap out of stuff.<br />
<br />
Ways to make the new BG fun.<br />
<br />
1) Mounts aren’t free you have to collect parts / resources to build them which drop off of players corpses.<br />
<br />
Example you loot a player's body and receive 4 bolts and a flask of diesel fule<br />
<br />
After you collected enough supplies you can choose to construct a vehicle. The vehicles you can construct are dependant on resources you control and the amount of supplies you have collected.<br />
<br />
Eg. You control the lumber mill you can make shredders for 40 bolts 2 flux capacitors and 9 flaks of desil <br />
You control the lumber mill and air pad you can make fighters. 60 bolts 8 flux capacitors and 12 flaks of desil and 2 coper servos.<br />
<br />
2) Vehicles should server particular functions and do so well but be generally ineffective on other projects.<br />
<br />
Seige tanks hit walls very hard and have lots of HP but a bomber can deal massive damage to them. Bombers on the other hand can drop players behind enemy lines and have lots of HP but can be heavily damaged by fighters.<br />
<br />
3) Entering a vehicle means when that vehicle dies so do you. The fact that a player jumps into a tank and when it is violently blown up miraculously exits with full health and mana is stupid. If your in a tank and it dies you die in the explosion. If you don’t want to go down with the ship exit vehicle before it goes down but the exit process should take 1-2 seconds so better not try to cut it too close.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vehicles can be a fun addition to a bg but they need to be balanced with infantry support like rocket launchers (that work) or turrets that rape vehicles with a much higher proficiency than ground troops.<br />
<br />
People who remember old AV with wolf riders, sky lords, and reaver reinforcements know how much fun big 40 on 40 battles can be with turn in reinforcements go back to that system where a collection system supports your army without being overpowered or freely available.</div></div><hr />

As a result of adding this battleground, blizzard should consolidate a few battlegroups so each battleground isnt diluted. Everyone joining in on the new bg 40v40 will be great, but AB and all the rest of the bgs will suffer.<br />

<br />
<br />
You can't just waltz up to the general and dps. You have to get around the keep's defenses somehow. That requires seige velhicles to destroy walls/door, airship parachute, catapult launching and if you parachute or launch you can use the keep's own explosives to destroy the wall/door.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Caster passengers in SotA demolishers can CRUSH players<br />
<br />
<br />
Casters on the demolishers can be targetted. Turrent in wintergrasp can be independantly targetted. The only players that can't be targetted are those inside a velhicle but then they can't use anything but the velhicles abilites in those cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Entering a vehicle means when that vehicle dies so do you. The fact that a player jumps into a tank and when it is violently blown up miraculously exits with full health and mana is stupid. If your in a tank and it dies you die in the explosion. If you don’t want to go down with the ship exit vehicle before it goes down but the exit process should take 1-2 seconds so better not try to cut it too close.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not stupid, its just auto-ejection so you don't have to do it. Which is good. Micromanging is annoying. And its not like the players are that hard to deal with if you can take down a velhicle in the first place. If you want people to exit or die you can't place a dely on that. Its hard enough to time things with incoming dps then to apply stupid limits.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Vehicles can be a fun addition to a bg but they need to be balanced with infantry support like rocket launchers (that work) or turrets that rape vehicles with a much higher proficiency than ground troops.<br />
<br />
<br />
Groups of players can already take down velhicles pretty easily. You can't make turrents or rockets &quot;rape&quot; them because it would defeat the purpose of the velhicles in order to break down the things those turrets and rockets are meant to defend.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People who remember old AV with wolf riders, sky lords, and reaver reinforcements know how much fun big 40 on 40 battles can be with turn in reinforcements go back to that system where a collection system supports your army without being overpowered or freely available.<br />

<br />
Yes the old times are always fun, but you can't discount new. There is nothing to say that IoC will not have these types of things in addition. Perhaps you can upgrade keep npc's by collecting scraps from players? Get oil from mobs to buff velhicles or something.<br />
<br />
We don't know everything in the IoC or how it will play. All your reasons why they should do something else could be invalidated by IoC because its all incorporated but won't be known until its on the ptr.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing wrong with vehicles. I think the problem is when everyone must use them (Uldar) or they have far too complex a set of features (Icecrown biplane dailies, OC) such that players feel they're being given a new class to learn.<br />
<br />
SoTA is perfect. Only a few have to use the vehicles and they're simple two-button things. WG is equally fun for the same reason.<br />
<br />
If they keep that concept, this will be a great addition to the BG lineup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes<br />
Yes<br />
No<br />
<br />
I don't like Wintergrasp, but thats mostly because it's too massive and it's more a zergfest then anything else. I think this battleground could be really interresting.</div></div><hr />

What they need to do is add more of the classic types.<br />
<br />
Half the people saying &quot;This sounds awesome&quot; probably were not around when the only BG was WSG for the longest time.<br />
THAT was awesome.<br />
Adding AV and AB WAS awesome.<br />
<br />
THIS is not. Add another 40v40 by all means, It would be fantastic, and I would love it. Just drop the Vehicle BS and stop trying to shove it down our throats.<br />
<br />
As for the Mount Tournament atm in Icecrown, WTF does that have to do with anything in the game? Wait, let me guess, they are preparing us to Battle the Lich King on Horses and Tigers with jousting sticks.....sounds fun.....<br />
<br />
<br />
I was around since the start when there use to be no BG's! Then they made wsg and you know what... I HATED IT! I loved SS vs TM far far far more then WSG! The only BG I liked was AV, when they released it of course :P because it was just a kill fest!!! I think they really should bring back bgs that are just &quot;Kill everyone for hours&quot; It was time killers... It was fun... It was rewarding... I miss the original AV.<br />
<br />
I love wintergrasp! I find siege vehicles fun! I Hate maly P3 but I love FL... You guys need to stop using maly P3 as an excuse... all siege vehicles are different in use! Just because one application sucks dose not mean they all suck! <br />
<br />

This BG sounds all kinds of awesome, yea it has vehicles but it doesn't sound as bad as SoTA, Hey get in this vehicle, knock down a wall and win. The offense and defense thing just didn't work out, hopefully this will. The environment sounds amazing, mountains, docks, caves, I hope it's as vast as AV, love the big battle grounds. Lets just hope they don't pull a SoTA and make the Marks of Isle of Conquest useless. Also sounds like this will be a new way to farm some honor with the resources giving continuous honor.</div></div><hr />

But after reading all of this... wonder if people post the same kind of &quot;oh shit again?&quot; in, let's say, Call of Duty forums...<br />
<br />
&quot;What? The new Call of Duty is again based on war??!?! WTF! I want one where I can infiltrate an enemy base to give a really nice hug and invite them for dinner!&quot;...<br />
<br />
Guess world of WARcraft would say something... but... well... no.<br />
<br />
Maybe a new BG called Isle of Resources... the faction who can farm the most gold/tree to the Chinese God win the match... I can alread see OP arms warriors bladestorming 6 trees at once (watch out druids, don't go tree form there...), while the DKs deathgrip the trees/gold bags to their bases...<br />
<br />
A BG where Alliance and Horde had a common enemy and would need to work together (or not?) to kill it... but would be really weird as a battleground... more like a mixed ally/horde raid (or coopgrounds hahaha) where stupid players would kill the oposite faction just to F@$# everyone's fun... &quot;lol! i'm soo good at killing unware partners! woot! madzkilsz!&quot;.<br />

<br />
Crazy King, Oddball, anything.<br />
<br />
Let's get another pure CTF BG out there, with a totally different map.<br />
<br />
Another AB, but with a different map. SAME KotH, DIFFERENT map.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2009-06-13, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't just waltz up to the general and dps. You have to get around the keep's defenses somehow. That requires seige velhicles to destroy walls/door, airship parachute, catapult launching and if you parachute or launch you can use the keep's own explosives to destroy the wall/door.<br />
Casters on the demolishers can be targetted. Turrent in wintergrasp can be independantly targetted. The only players that can't be targetted are those inside a velhicle but then they can't use anything but the velhicles abilites in those cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not stupid, its just auto-ejection so you don't have to do it. Which is good. Micromanging is annoying. And its not like the players are that hard to deal with if you can take down a velhicle in the first place. If you want people to exit or die you can't place a dely on that. Its hard enough to time things with incoming dps then to apply stupid limits.<br />
<br />
Groups of players can already take down velhicles pretty easily. You can't make turrents or rockets &quot;rape&quot; them because it would defeat the purpose of the velhicles in order to break down the things those turrets and rockets are meant to defend.<br />
<br />
Yes the old times are always fun, but you can't discount new. There is nothing to say that IoC will not have these types of things in addition. Perhaps you can upgrade keep npc's by collecting scraps from players? Get oil from mobs to buff velhicles or something.<br />
<br />
We don't know everything in the IoC or how it will play. All your reasons why they should do something else could be invalidated by IoC because its all incorporated but won't be known until its on the ptr.<br />
<br />
<br />
WG is such a lag/disconnect party that I don't play it anymore, but the players inside the vehicles, when they're destroyed, didn't they get out of them with half HP?<br />
<br />
btw... a paladin could bubble and be immune to vehicle explosion damage :) could even divine sacrifice the vehicle's crew :)</div></div><hr />

Poor argument, more of an insult. You should know better your self that a good MMO should not be all around killing in quests. While I don't mind it, its getting boring after a while.<br />
<br />
My main argument is that new BG is poor on new ideas, there is so much more you can do to make an unique BG, instead of merging existing ones, and add a twist or two.<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally agree. They should implement a battleground where there is no killing - it could be like After-AV and the players just run around bandaging NPCs and asking them questions in a race to see who's the first to collect enough evidence to accuse the other of war crimes.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what country you come from, nor do I care, but personal attacks like that aren't needed.<br />

I can tell you're someone that hasn't lived or even been to America, so you have no right to judge what the people are like.

Your arrogance could penetrate the great Chinese wall. Did I say that there should be no killing? No, I didn't. However I said that they should use some new techniques in BG then the old capture points (AB) and generals like in AV.

This might not be the case.. They clearly added some sort of defense system with 4 cannons and crap.. <br />
<br />
So its not live just yet.. So instead of painting devils on the wall.. Take a deep breath, and hold it untill it actually goes live.. Is it shit.. Then come back and whine and rant like always.. But atleast wait untill Its live before the flamewars start :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This bg is just a piece of rock with random buildings throw on top of it. Nevermind how that derrick, mine, or airport got there. Just fight over it!<br />
<br />
I remember when Blizz wasn't lazy and had background history of each bg (wsg - orcs want lumber but NE likes trees, AV -dorf wanting to hunt for titan relics on ancient Frostwolf territory, etc).<br />
<br />
<br />
What about an island with a lot of oil and mines full of gold, that they both want for themselves.<br />

It sounds like a lagg hell to me.<br />
<br />
Also: will 4 cannons stop it from becoming a single minded zerg?<br />
WG has cannons, it's a zerg.<br />
AV has tons of stuff nobody even remembers...<br />
<br />
Will the result on live actually be what they promise now?<br />
WG was getting flying vehicles, remember...<br />
<br />
When they put so much work in the new BG's, that are ALL vehicle based, why are the old BG's still broken?<br />
<br />
This could be a nice addition, but for crying out loud: FIX your existing crap first.<br />
BG's are a mindless grind, they reward the most stupid strategies first.<br />
AV is short pve race where the less you pvp, the faster you win.<br />
<br />
BG's are waiting on a fair honor reward system for ages now. Everything is based on hk farming. And gearwise everything is focused on arena.<br />
Even the BG achievements make no sense: a lot classes and speccs are not fit to be Flag defenders AND runners in WSG for example.<br />
<br />
If Blizz can assure me this new bg will be balanced and have no insane lagg (EVER, so not at the start either ---&gt; test servers thataway), than it could be fun.<br />
But as said: work on your old BG's as well.<br />
Stop selling us new carrots on a stick, if you let the old carrots rot!</div></div><hr />

I would be very interested to see if you could name a single pvp game of any genre whose mechanics do not boil down into either or any combination of :<br />
A) kill target<br />
B) occupy space<br />
C) control object<br />

The single most important thing for a battleground to become popular is the honor it gives. Will the honor be balanced, and will you be rewarded for the effort you do, for example by capturing one of the strategical points? Will it be worth getting these points, or will you gain more honor slaying anyone in sight?<br />
I also believe the amount of vehicles available to each side will play a huge role. If there is no more than say 20% of the players controlling a vehicle at any time, and that you can complete the objectives without having to have the vehicles involved all the time, I believe that most people can live with that and even if your team has this death knight occupying one of your vehicles while spinning around trying to hit this one enemy over and over again. If there is just no way you can win the battle without having experienced or at the very least non-retarded drivers, I think the battleground can be very frustrating because a noob or two can ruin it for the 33 other people (5 botters obviously..)</div></div><hr />

As you mention your self, I said so about quests, not about BG. While I do think that quests doesn't need to involve only around killing, battle ground is called so for a reason. I do think that killing is essential in a BG, however the mechanic could be changed. Sure, most are about control object/occupy space, however there are lot of different ways to make it exiting in a new way, while the new BG is just a merged AB and AV, nothing new, except for flying vehicles.<br />
<br />
Just look at Warhammer as example. They succeed to make many BGs with twists and new ideas in each of them, instead of remaking one into another. <br />
<br />
But the Isle of Conquest is not the single example of Bliizards lack of imagination. Just loot at SotA. It's basically WG in miniformat, nothing else (I'm not saying its bad.. or good). Fortress you gotta destroy with vehicles, and few workshops to claim.. talk about poor fantasy.</div></div><hr />

Well as long as the game lasts longer than AV usually does, gets people fighting each other and no vehicle overload I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have looked at Warhammer. I played through most of the Beta and for several weeks after release. Every single battleground they have is a variant of WSG or AB. 'Troll Ball' is a perfect example, where a BG with &quot;twists and new ideas&quot; is capture-the-flag then go and stand in occupy hot-spots. That's all it is. About as innovative as they got was WSG but the flag doesn't capture when you take it back to your base, it generates exponential points for how long you control it while stacking a damage multiplying debuff - or &quot;AB, but on multiple floors of a single building!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Get all glassy-eyed about original AV any time you want, but what you can't deny is that the forums used to be FULL of people screaming at Blizzard to do something about 3+ hour AV battles. Heck, I think I spent 3 hours in one once that I joined after both sides had been slogging away at each other for an hour and a half already.<br />
<br />
Epic? Well.. perhaps by some definitions.<br />
<br />
Fun? Most people didn't think so at the time.<br />
<br />
If you want that today, you can have it. Just go gather up at least 40 people who feel like you do and raid an opposing city. Don't kill the leader, just hang out inside the gates killing anyone who opposes you. You'll get your 5-hour bloodbath and you'll even get some reasonably good folks to fight against as word spreads that you're not moving.</div></div><hr />

Ah, I miss the old HWL grind... Lack of sleep... hallucinations... people running away when they see you, because you're going to kill them since they're in your level range, and it'll bump you up a rank... farming for hours to get rid of DHKs...<br />
<br />
... Falling asleep at your computer, logging back in to WoW, and your AV is still going on... 12 hours later, after a 10 hour binge. Getting more than 500 HKs in a single battle...<br />

If you want to get rid of reinforcements you'll need to convince Blizzard to hand out tokens for completing objectives rather than battlegrounds and get them to balance out honour between kills and objectives.<br />
Personally I'd love to go back to an original AV form where there was always a game going and you could just drop in, play as long as you want without feeling committed, and then leave.</div></div><hr />
