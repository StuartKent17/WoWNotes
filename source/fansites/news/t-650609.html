Pet scaling<br />
We think it's probably time to let pets scale, to some extent, with resilience and spell pen.<br />
<br />
The way pets scale from the master's stats was implemented (on our side) in a slightly clunky way which made it difficult to add additional stats. In BC, it took some effort to kill a pet so it wasn't a burning problem for us. In LK, we have bumped up pet health a few times, but we are thinking now that the balance will never work right without some crit mitigation. Pets will never scale right with gear as long as the master improves in ways that don't benefit the pet.<br />
<br />
We have a new way to let pets scale, and assuming it works, we should be able to give the pets scale with all relevant stats from the master, from hit to haste to crit. Some things will need to scale at 100%, since it's silly to have your pet inherit part of your +hit.<br />
<br />
No promises until you actually see it live, but that's what we are thinking at the moment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367882841-discussion-hunterlock-pet-survivability.html))<br />
<br />
Formulas changes<br />
We change a lot of numbers every expansion. You should not assume that everything stays the same when we raise the level cap. Some formulae will still work with accepted numbers, but you may want to re-test others.<br />
<br />
We generally support the players working to figure out exactly how everything works. That has been a big part of the WoW community since the inception. We think it takes some of the magic out of the game when everything is completely laid bare. However, sometimes the formulae we use are so arcane that we feel like it is appropriate to give the theorycrafters a peek behind the curtain. We did so with armor penetration and the new Arena reating calculations recently, and now with rage. In this case some players were assuming that rage generation was stealth nerfed recently so we wanted to clearly set the record straight.

Resto druids in Arenas<br />
While we were succesful getting Resto druids into tree form in Arena, we were a little too succesful. We're not sure it's fun for either the druid or the people trying to kill the druid to be locked in tree form all the time. This change will hopefully make the fights a little more dynamic.

Single target healing<br />
An apparent &quot;double standard&quot; exists because the game has far fewer healing specs than damage specs. Most 25-player raids are going to have a diversity of healers so it's okay in our minds for them to have more discrete niches. While there are many fights where single-target damage is not particularly useful, there are very, very few fights that are not tanked, and therefore where single-target healing is not particularly useful. Besides, while the paladin niche may be single-target healing, when I look at raid stats, nearly all of them are managing to heal people besides the MT. I've run 10-player raids with 2 paladin healers plenty of times. It works fine. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367602316-question-about-double-standard.html))<br />

AoE Ability added to Rogues in WotLK<br />
Most trash pulls in Naxx used AE almost exlcusively. Being a single-target damage-dealer, and one with combo points no less, felt just terrible. Yeah, I know &quot;nobody cares about trash.&quot; Except they do. Rogues (and at the time other specs with sub-par AE dps) wondered why anyone would want to bring them when the raid leader could speed up the whole raid by bringing someone who could AE. There are adds on some of the boss fights too and we knew that many of the upcoming Ulduar fights would have a lot of AE opportunities too.<br />
<br />
We feel these days like &quot;I bring the best AE!&quot; is not a strong niche. Likewise, it felt archaic to say that some characters just had to sit around while everyone else AE'd those big packs down.

Heroic Strike in WotLK<br />
In BC, Heroic Strike was a decision. You used it when you needed to vent off excess rage. The problem in LK is that the excess rage situation is almost 100% of the time, so Heroic Strike isn't a decision anymore. We need to fix it.

FAILOC-ALYPSE!<br />

Jim is stupid easy. I got a lot farther than this (saw over a 30x combo multiplier) but this was the last screen shot I took. About 5 min later, I let 2 past me. :(<br />

It got to the point where the nuke was my main weapon, as I couldn't kill them fast enough with the gun (no turbo-fire). But with over 1000g per large bag, it wasn't an issue.</div></div><hr />

No, just nuke the screen every 3-4 second when the first murloc approach the other side, and grab the gold bag.<br />
<br />
With x100 bonus, a small bag of gold is 1000 gold, and a big bag is 5000 gold (4 and 20 nuke)</div></div><hr />

Well, if appreciating the testicular fortitude to go infront of this fucked up community and being honest about the development process, going the extra mile to answer the questions he is not supposed to answer, if appreciating that is considered bad, then I feel even bigger disgust about this community than before. If that is even possible.<br />
<br />
You fags don't know what you want, but you want it now. You always think about your and only your class. &quot;Buff my class, nerf all others&quot; is the mantra you religiously preach every day, and when there is a nerf on the horizon, you refuse to understand the context of it, which, were not for Ghostcrawler, you would never know. You'd just see that you are nerfed. No explanations. FUCK YES THAT WAS AWSUM EH?<br />
<br />
Let's add the number of idiots that can't read for comprehension to save their lives, add GC's rather open-for-interpretation posts, and you get yet another shitstorm being brewn by idiots.<br />
<br />
Rather being &quot;fed by a silver spoon&quot; than eat with fingers, grunt all the time and throw rocks at your shadows. But wait, you guys do that regardless.</div></div><hr />

No more climbing where a player can't, dazing players while hitting from behind, taunt... whatever a player can't do, a pet shouldn't be able to do.<br />
<br />
Then it would be ok to give then hit, resilience, atk power, armor, armor pen, everything a player can have...</div></div><hr />

Single target healing<br />
An apparent &quot;double standard&quot; exists because the game has far fewer healing specs than damage specs. Most 25-player raids are going to have a diversity of healers so it's okay in our minds for them to have more discrete niches. While there are many fights where single-target damage is not particularly useful, there are very, very few fights that are not tanked, and therefore where single-target healing is not particularly useful. Besides, while the paladin niche may be single-target healing, when I look at raid stats, nearly all of them are managing to heal people besides the MT. I've run 10-player raids with 2 paladin healers plenty of times. It works fine. (Source)<br />

<br />
With Glyph of Holy Light (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41106) &amp; Light's Beacon <br />
(http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=53651) how can Blizzard imply that they are not being equipped to &quot;Raid Heal&quot;. I like the fact that they gave Paladins those abilities because it helps me keep the Raid alive. However it has made my role as a Shaman slight devalued. Even back in MC days Paladins were some of the best &quot;Raid Healers&quot; in the game, Flash of Light (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=27137) spam FTW. In all fairness I am not an expert on the Paladin class, but I do try to know the abilities of the other raiders. So I may be missing something, but to imply that they may be gimped is CRAZY.</div></div><hr />
