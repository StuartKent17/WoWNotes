Visit Account Management to begin the paid character-name-change process. The fee is $10 per name change. As with our recent addition of voice chat to the game, this feature is being rolled out across all realms in several phases. The first-phase realms are listed in this forum post. Enjoy this new feature and the subsequent effect that your bold new name will have on friends and foes alike.<br />

The season 3 retribution set has been changed. We're removing the Armor Penetration and Spell Damage that was being added to season 3, and moving those stat points into Strength. Those changes should be visible in an upcoming PTR build. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366733197&amp;postId=25734107361&amp;sid=1#439))<br />

Yesterday's recap<br />
I'm getting used to patch notes-like compilations, so here is a small summary of all the new things added in yesterday's PTR build.<br />
For all classes changes, check the patch notes update (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php#23changes) posted 3 days ago. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Arena<br />
[Vengeful Gladiator's Battle Staff] (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/battle_staff.jpg) (3750 AP),[Vengeful Gladiator's Rifle] (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/rifle.jpg) (3750 AP),[Vengeful Gladiator's Longbow] (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/longbow.jpg) and [Vengeful Gladiator's Shield Wall] (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/shield_wall.jpg) (1875 AP) have been added to arena rewards.<br />
Season 1 Gear is now buyable with honor (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/s1honor.jpg) on PTR, rings and amulets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/s3/s3_ringamu2.jpg) too. There isn't any update of cloaks for the moment. If you're looking for the belt/boots/bracers of each set you can find them with their respective season 3 set in the 2.3 compilation<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters<br />
All ranged attacks now have a wonderful 1 yard minimum range (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/hunter1yard.jpg).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
Ritual of Refreshment now requires 2 [item=17020]<br />
The 4-piece bonus of Gladiator's set now reduces the cooldown of the Blink spell by 2 seconds instead of reducing the cast time of Polymorph by 0.15 second.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
The threat reduction on Fanaticism listed in the patch notes update (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php#23changes) has been modified to not apply when Righteous Fury is active. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Guards have been added to the area surrounding Zul'aman to prevent excessive ganking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Alchemy<br />
The side effects of the Mad Alchemist potion might be the same as the &quot;***** Blood&quot; debuffs from Zangarmarsh fireflies. (This is still very, very unconfirmed)<br />
Engineering<br />
[list] [item=20475] mats have been lowered, it now requires 1x Adamantite Bar, 4x Simple Wood, and 2x Handful of Fel Iron Bolts. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Factions<br />
A new pet has been added (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/sporebatdr8.jpg) to Sporeggar rewards. (Exalted)<br />
Potions buyable for 50 apexis shards at the Ogri'la Quartermasters have been upgraded to match &quot;Super&quot; potions instead of &quot;Major&quot; (Example : 1800-3000 Mana instead of 1350-2250)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Environment<br />
Zeppelins and Boats around the world now have an embedded crew and reagents/food vendors (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/zepvendor.jpg)</div></div><hr />

I also think the 10$ fee is totally reasonable. It's bad for the community if people change their names all the time. OMG, think if Epic Kungen changed name!==!=!<br />

The name in the ignore lists changes too. So this wouldn't work.<br />

Add a 6-month CD to the name change.<br />

I'm thinking more along the lines how some people might be able to escape a bad reputation they have made, whether or not this was made through ninjalooting.<br />

It's a good thing that the friendslist atleast, and probably also the ignorelist retains the character even after renaming :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ice9</div><div class="date">2007-10-26, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just please take out the Blood debuff rumor on the Mad Alchemist's pot. I've downed around 75 potions so far myself, and people on both US and EU profession forum took anywhere between 20 to 150 potions and no one reported any effect so far. The person that submitted it probably got stung by one of the wasps while picking Ragveil and thought it was from the potion. It's pretty safe to say that it's bugged and does not give any side effect at this point.<br />
<br />
Second of all, the debuff is displayed as magic. It wouldn't make sense to give a debuff that can be dispelled anyway. And it is still in contradiction with the blue post about the elixir buff you're supossed to get.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2007-10-26, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to see that Blizzard still has no clue at all how a Mage plays. After getting the &quot;0.15 off of Polymorph is useless&quot; thrown in their faces (why should the glove bonus be so much better than the 4 piece?), they revert back to the horrible 2 seconds off Blink cooldown. Both of those were/are completely useless.<br />
<br />
Something like 15 seconds off of Hypothermia, Blazing Speed proc rate increase, or Slow harder to dispell would all be nice (together) as a 4 piece set bonus and infinitely more useful than 2 seconds off of Blink cooldown.</div></div><hr />
