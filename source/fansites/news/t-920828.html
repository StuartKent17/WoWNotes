Dragonwrath, Teracgosa's Rest Preview - Legendary Staff Questline (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2290-Dragonwrath-Teracgosa-s-Rest-Preview)<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.2 PTR Notes - 06/10 Update<br />
General<br />
New Quest Chain: Elemental Bonds<br />
<br />
A New quest line is now available to level-85 Horde and Alliance characters, bringing brave adventurers to Thrall's aid. The Call of the World-Shaman, the quest which will point players toward Thrall and The Nordrassil Summit, can be obtained in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Raid: The Firelands<br />
<br />
Located within the Elemental Plane, the Firelands is an all-new 10- and 25-player raid featuring normal and Heroic difficulties! Battle-hardened veterans of the Horde and Alliance now have an opportunity to strike at Ragnaros the Firelord and his loyal servants by venturing into their domain via Sulfuron Spire in Mount Hyjal.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Legendary Item: Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest<br />
<br />
Steadfast raiders have an opportunity to embark on a series of quests to create an all-new legendary caster staff. In order to begin the process of assembling the staff, players must first kill a Molten Lord in the Firelands. Once a Molten Lord is killed, players can accept the quest A Legendary Engagement from Ziradormi or Coridormi in Orgrimmar or Stormwind.<br />
<br />
<br />
New User Interface Feature: Dungeon Journal<br />
<br />
A host of dungeon information is now built into the user interface via the all-new Dungeon Journal. This feature can be accessed via a new button in the Navigation tray from anywhere in the world. Boss background story, encounter details, abilities, and loot can be viewed with the Dungeon Journal for all bosses which have been integrated into the new system (this includes bosses for all Cataclysm dungeons and raids). Additional dungeons are planned to be incorporated in future updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
Raid Profiles have been added which allow players to save the raid window user interface layout based on type of content (i.e. 10-player raids, 25-player raids, Battlegrounds, etc.) for future use. <br />
<br />
Players can select PvE, PvP, specialization, and group size. Each Raid Profile type will then automatically setup going forward. <br />
The pullout panel will be available for 5-player content as well when Show Raid Frames is selected. <br />
Raid Profiles can list groups horizontally as well as vertically. <br />
<br />
A Raid button has been added to the Navigation tray which will bring players straight to the Raid window in the Social pane. <br />
<br />
<br />
Valor Points <br />
<br />
The maximum number of Valor Points which can be earned in a week from any and all applicable dungeons and raids is now 980, down from 1250. <br />
The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Rise of the Zandalari dungeons remains at 980.<br />
The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Heroic dungeons remains at 490.<br />
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss in the Firelands is 70 in 10-player mode, and 90 in 25-player mode.<br />
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing Occu'thar in Baradin Hold is 35 in 10-player mode, and 45 in 25-player mode.<br />
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss on Heroic difficulty in The Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent, and Throne of the Four winds is 35 in 10-player mode, and 45 in 25-player mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Baradin Hold <br />
<br />
Occu'thar has broken free from his cage and presents an all-new boss challenge to players in 10- and 25-player arrangements who control Tol Barad.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
New PvP ground mounts, the Vicious War Wolf (Horde) and Vicious War Steed (Alliance), will be awarded to players for completing achievements to win 75, 150, and 300 Rated Battlegrounds respectively, rather than for being in the top .5% of the ladder at the end of each season as with Arenas. This award system is to better compliment the spirit of Battlegrounds. One account-bound mount will be awarded for each achievement unlocked, allowing players who obtain 150 and 300 Rated Battleground wins to earn this mount a second and third time. The additional mounts earned can then be sent to alt characters, given they’re account-bound. These mounts are awarded as soon as an associated achievement is unlocked and do not correspond with end-of-season rewards.<br />
The individual Matchmaking Rating column has been removed from the Rated Battleground scoreboard and replaced with a team Matchmaking Rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
War Games<br />
<br />
Many improvements have been made to the War Games interface. It now has its own panel for ease of use and raid/group leaders are the only ones who can challenge another group to War Games.<br />
<br />

Unholy<br />
<br />
Unholy Might now increases Strength by 10% 20%, up from 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1117-Druid-Cataclysm))<br />
Feral<br />
<br />
Druids now gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, down from 2. They continue to gain 2 attack power per point of Agility while in Cat Form or Bear Form. In addition, Cat Form’s scaling rate from gear upgrades was slower than other classes, which was causing them to fall behind in damage with higher item levels. To counter the Strength change and improve scaling, the following changes have been made. All numbers cited are for level-85 druids.<br />
<br />
Mangle (Cat) damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 530% 540% weapon damage, up from 460%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.<br />
Rake initial damage on hit now deals the same damage as each periodic tick (and is treated the same for all combat calculations). Periodic damage now gains 14.7% of attack power per tick, up from 12.6%, and base damage per tick has been lowered from 557 to 56. There is a known issue with Rake’s tooltip being incorrect from this change will be corrected in a future patch.<br />
Ravage damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 975% 950% weapon damage, up from 850%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 532.<br />
Savage Roar now grants 80% increased damage to melee auto attacks, up from 50%. The Glyph of Savage Roar remains an unchanged bonus of 5% to that total.<br />
Shred damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 520% 540% weapon damage, up from 450%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance<br />
<br />
Starfire damage has been increased by approximately 23%.<br />
Wrath damage has been increased by approximately 23%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Set Bonuses<br />
<br />
The 4-piece Balance druid tier 11 PvE set bonus, Astral Alignment, now provides a total of 15% critical strike chance with 3 charges, decreasing by 5% per charge, instead of 99% decreasing by 33% per charge. This change was made because the set bonus proved so valuable it was not possible to upgrade out of the set into tier 12. To compensate, changes have been made to Starfire and Wrath (listed at the top of the druid class section).<br />
<br />

Holy<br />
<br />
Illuminated Healing (Mastery) has been adjusted slightly so that if a paladin refreshes an existing copy of his or her own Illuminated Healing on a target, the new absorption amount will be added into the old absorption amount and the duration will be reset. The total absorption created can never exceed 1/3 of the casting paladin's health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
<br />
Inquiry of Faith now increases Inquisition duration by 66/133/200%, up from 50/100/150%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
Guild Finder<br />
<br />
Long comments will now work and not be cut off in the display.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
The User Interface panels have been resized so there is no more need for scroll bars.The <br />
Addons will no longer be able to intelligently swap items by working with the built-in Equipment Manager.<br />
Character talent specializations can now be viewed on mouseover of the Battlegrounds Scoreboard.<br />
There is now a Dismiss Pet option on unit frames.<br />
The durability character display will now show items as yellow when they are below 20% durability, instead of when items have 5 durability or less.<br />
The Macros window and Spellbook can now both be open at the same time to allow for more intuitive macro creation. In addition, the Macros window has a Save/Cancel button.<br />
It is now easier to change the language of the game client to any language available in the region.<br />
A target or focus target can be selected within the mini-map tracking (does not include enemy players).<br />
Vendors now display currency types they use.</div></div><hr />

Yes its been to long and that buff helps scaling instead of a static buff which wouldn't have helped to much with the new gear coming out.</div></div><hr />

um hate to brake it to u but they didnt but it gave use and incentive to raid when we didnt need gear from certain bosses and we may not have a setup for hms that just means that when ppl get wat they want and they cant do hms ppl just wont raid anymore and how is it &quot;free valor without raiding&quot; the VP cap for doing 7 za/zg a week is 980 the only way to get 1250 per week is by RAIDING<br />

also the vp from raiding stands at (bare in mind that this is with the changes)<br />

Why couldn't they just bump the Valor Point gains from Firelands bosses to make it in line with the 4.0 raid VP gains? Sure, that would be about 120-130VP per boss in 10man and 150-160VP in 25man (that's with the old 1250 weekly cap), but raids should be the main source for those points, right?

A buff for any Boomkin without 4pc T11, yes indeed. For those with it, it was a change to offset the bat that just hit their set bonus, so they will actually move OFF to Tier 12.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a buff for those with the 4pc set also. Because T12 wasn't an upgrade. But now it is. So now you can have 4pc T12 and still get the increased damage starfire and wrath get. So it's like getting 4pc t11 and 4pc t12 at once.</div></div><hr />

Right?If I remember correctly, that's what Blizzard stated at the beginning of this expansion. People would not have to run heroics to meet the weekly cap once they started raiding. Now for that to be case you'll have to raid all of the current and last tier to cap because t10 is getting points cut? <br />
<br />
I don't like this change at all.<br />
<br />
I see this as just a way to try and dump more tanks into the rdf really. They won't be able to cap VP from raiding so they'll hit up the rdf and maybe go solo to get a loot bag? <br />

<br />
Let's clear something out for you:<br />
<br />
SC2= 3 races = 3 &quot;classes&quot; to balance<br />
WoW=10 classes x 3 specs each = a total of 30 &quot;classes&quot; to balance<br />
<br />
That's why they are &quot;better&quot; at balancing SC2. Much harder to balance 30 classes/specs than it is to balance 3 races.</div></div><hr />

The tokens you get from doing said dailies get you gear, the new recipes that are added you can get, and then make gear. Once you've got bought your 3 pieces of tier, by then, you'll probably of already gotten rep, gold, raid drop, anything in between, that is the exact same thing you can get from VPs.</div></div><hr />

People would not have to run heroics to meet the weekly cap once they started raiding. Now for that to be case you'll have to raid all of the current and last tier to cap because t10 is getting points cut? <br />
<br />
I don't like this change at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, at first the idea was that 25man raiding guilds could get the cap from raiding, while 10man guilds would have to run heroics as well to reach the cap, and those who only do heroic 5mans couldn't get the cap at all. With this change, you can get the new 980VP cap if you raid all of the Firelands bosses and all of the t11 heroic content, but doing Troll 5mans is so much easier (unless you want some extra 372 loot from t11).<br />
<br />
While I'm not jumping on a soapbox and yelling &quot;this is the worst thing ever, I quit now&quot;, I would like to hear an actual reasoning to this change, because I don't really understand why they did this.</div></div><hr />

With just 7 bosses in Firelands, to reach old VP Cap you would have to clear Heroics... so to avoid either that or insane VP per boss kill, they lowered CAP.<br />

<br />
25 is more difficult to coordinate, and this is offset by tuning all bosses as if you had two dead weight DPS in your group, lying there dead or missing from the raid entirely. 25 man is easier to get the correct raid composition, and you are able to bring a spec which offers 4k less DPS to bring an important buff (which scales 150% better than it does in 10 man, easily making up for their personal DPS loss).<br />
<br />
25man is easier by all means except getting the group together. The majority of 25 man groups currently are those older groups from WoTLK, or the large guilds who need not worry about recruitment.<br />
<br />
Having 3 people die on a 25-man boss is nearly the same as losing a single person in 10-man. Thus, each player in a 10-man is more of a liability.<br />
<br />
So you could say 25-man is simply easier all around. There is absolutely no reason for 25-man to offer more valor points.<br />
<br />
But at least the gear they get is still the same.</div></div><hr />

Essentially you are right that it is a buff and a nerf. In one of their previous statements, Blizzard pointed out that they were trying to do things like scale bears DPS / TPS so that it would be a buff at lower gear levels and a nerf at higher gear levels. As a player who isn't yet raiding and in full epics, you'll see this as a buff from what is on live realms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier 11, you had three raids for progression - so your raiding group had a choice on where they were going to &quot;farm&quot; for those VPs. In 4.2 there is only one option - The Firelands; and since the vast majority will NOT have it on farm for the first few weeks, everyone is going to be running dungeons and Tier 11 content anyhow to cap out those valor points.<br />
<br />
And by the time these groups DO get Firelands on farm status, you won't *need* the VP, because you would've purchased the 3 items that were useful to you and have moved on to just needing the raid loot, so presto, no more dungeons or Tier 11 content anyhow.</div></div><hr />

Nope, it's a PoS trash mob at the beginning of the Firelands raid. Essentially instead of non-raiders farming ICC trash to get ashen-verdict rep, they'll be farming Firelands trash to start the legendary staff quest. Oh yeah, not to mention the fact that you no longer have to be 12/12 to start the quest, you could have just hit 85 that day and started it.<br />

That and the Valor point cap only happening by either doing 2 TIERS of raiding or just doing 7 45-minute dungeons a week, it seems like blizzard wants to penalize people who put time into raiding. Why put the effort in when blizzard is rewarding lack of effort?</div></div><hr />

I think below ilvl 359, it will be a buff. There are just so many different things happening at the same time that it is really hard to predict. The change to STR is a small nerf to raiding druids, but will be hardly noticeable to anyone else. The changes to the actual attacks is a buff for lower levels, but a nerf for top tier feral.

No, they're trying to extend content and force people into ZG/ZA by making the max rewards take much longer without them. <br />

Sadly, I think they're just trying to milk WoW at this point and will never try to resurrect it.<br />
<br />
600k subscribers lost in a quarter is huge. I know some fanboys dismiss it as nothing, but even if that rate doesn't increase, they'll lose a full 2.4 million subscribers by the end of the year. Potentially losing 2.4 million subs = huge message.<br />
<br />
Yet, since that news, they have decided to:<br />
- Create premium subscription in-game content.<br />
- Scrap Abyssal Maw.<br />
- Create a 7-boss raid tier.<br />
- Nerf the VP gain rate to artificially extend that 7-boss tier.<br />
- Force arena players to also do rated BG's to cap.<br />
- Increase the cost of PVP weapons to prolong arena/RBG grinds.<br />
- Promote a 2-month grindfest daily hub as major content.<br />
- And so on....<br />
<br />
They're going to get every penny they can from WoW and then dump it. It's sad, but seeing how they handled CoD and GH, we should have seen this coming.</div></div><hr />

I was feeling a little nostalgic about not playing wow earlier today, but after seeing this thread my desire to play again has evaporated. Fizzled. <br />
<br />
The 4.2 patch notes are laughable, and none of them deal with the issues I had with cataclysm. Besides rehashing old content and forcing people to play longer, there's absolutely no improvement. I really wonder who's the developer planner for the WoW franchise because he's astoundingly disconnected with what's going on.</div></div><hr />

Really wonder why they thought giving 25m raiders more VP than 10m raiders was a good idea in the first place.<br />
Or why 10m only gets 2 items and 25m gets 6, a perfect example of how retarded this is: last week atramedes finally decided to drop his trinket after dropping his plate chest every single kill(seriously), and chimearon dropped his the same reset, and they killed both bosses every reset since mid january.<br />

AWESOME. why? because I have gotten 4 extra boots and 2k extra valors and I haven't raided all the time and I have stopped doing heroics 3-4 months ago. Why would I actually need higher cap? valors are pretty useless. SUre now it takes few weeks extra to get those items but its mmorpg and you shouldn't get all the items in 1 day.<br />
<br />
Also I'm pretty sure they lowered the cap because of this:<br />
<br />
7x70 = 490 + 13*35 = 455+490 = 945 (10 man t12 and t11 hc)<br />
7x90 = 630<br />
<br />
if the cap would be 1250 then the real raiders would be forced to do more dungeons. And people were complaining alot that they have to go do heroics to cap the valors.<br />
<br />
<br />
So cap was probably lowered so raiders doesn't have to start to raid heroics. Ok now its easier to get couple new epics for alts and otherwise low geared people but it wasn't that hard last time.</div></div><hr />

If you could get all the gear from raid bosses with valor points then yest it would discourage raiding, but that isn't the case.

<br />
<br />
We, and by we I mean you, since your complaining, don't have to do anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't want to do the old content to get your gear, don't. It'll take you longer than someone maxing it out with heroics, or maybe it'll even out. You cap it the way you want to, be it the usual raid to 980-heroic to 1250, and person B will cap it the way they want to, whether it be a combo of raids and heroics like usual, or by completely doing heroics to get every piece besides two tier set pieces, and then raiding to get the tokens for said pieces, and for casters, their legendary for this tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
It isn't hurting anything but your ego by them getting gear. If anything, it'll help you, if they are on your server and are only being held back by gear restricting limitations, which by this patch, those will be eradicated.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You do not have to have defeated any bosses from the previous tier. That was a requirement we ultimately decided to get rid of.&quot; <br />

Only me who find it disappointing? I found it great that people need to clear earlier contents in order to be able to even start with the whole quest chain. It's not like It's superhard, especially when Firelands hit and all bosses get ubernerfed in BWD/BOT/TOT4W. Just my 5 bucks.</div></div><hr />

Not really..... They made that change right at the beginning of Cataclysm. 25 mans award more loot (drops AND vp) as an incentive to do 25 man raids.<br />

<br />
wow...just wow....So now someone that doesnt raid will get valor at the same rate as someone that does.....<br />
<br />
True... but look at it this way... They can get a &quot;few&quot; items. They cant get 4pt bonuses and they cant get the drops from the raid. There isnt THAT much people will need to spend valor on anyway I think.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2011-06-11 at 04:38 PM ----------<br />
<br />
<br />
It has been like that for a while! 25 are suppose to be harder to coordinate thus award more points. However I don't find this really fair as some of the raid content is really harder on 10 Man mode...<br />
<br />
its because 25mans are harder to COORDINATE - its a bribe to do 25 mans basically - if it wasnt like that - more people wouold just do 10. Its not because 25 is harder to DO.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2011-06-11 at 04:40 PM ----------<br />
<br />
<br />
So you could say 25-man is simply easier all around. There is absolutely no reason for 25-man to offer more valor points.<br />
<br />
You could do - but thats the exact reason why they DO offer more valor points.... Its not harder to do, but its harder to arrange. If they didnt give an incentive people wouldnt raid 25 man and they would then lose players who only liked 25 man.<br />
<br />

It'd be good if you learned to read. People aren't complaining that they can't get their new ilvl gear in a day, they are complaining that you can just do za/zg to get the gear instead of doing full raids.<br />
<br />
Indeed.... I probably wont be in those raids for a long time - we're only just about to start the T11 raids and thats fine with me. Even I think this is silly though - sure I can get the cap by doing zandalari but I think its very odd that I can. I think I should have to raid to get that.<br />

That and the Valor point cap only happening by either doing 2 TIERS of raiding or just doing 7 45-minute dungeons a week, it seems like blizzard wants to penalize people who put time into raiding. Why put the effort in when blizzard is rewarding lack of effort?<br />
<br />
The REAL rewards for raiding are the experiences of the fights - and the loot that drops from the bosses (and maybe trash) - the VP is just nice icing on the cake really after the 3 parts T12.</div></div><hr />

No no no - you dont get it - poor you! 10 and 25 on the same lockout was because Blizzard felt sorry for us getting too tired running both 10 and 25 and knowing that we wouldnt look after outselves properly - decided (like good mummy and daddy) to help us by &quot;removing temptation&quot;.

anyhoo, I think they might reduce the vp's troll dungeons give. Maybe to something like 90 or reduce them across the board to something like 50 for regular hc's and 70 for troll ones just so people wont get capped just from hc's alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not the person you are replying to, but the information that was put out before (maybe a month ago) had most items priced less than that. Some of us don´t play on the PTR, so probably are ´thinking´of the old ptr information put on fansites. I think the bracers were 1250 and the neck was only 900 (both were boe at the time, not sure if they still are). Just going from memory on all that, but yeah, I too also thought the prices were all going to be lower.<br />
<br />
I understand them lowering the VP cap to 980 because there are less bosses.. I guess the surprising part to me is that they are allowing people to cap VP without doing any raiding at all. I also disagree with the people that are saying they are doing this to force raid tanks and healers to do troll dungeons... the proportion of tanks in raids is lower than in 5 mans.. so there will actually be more dps queueing because of this.<br />
<br />
It is no big deal anway.. there are very few things to buy with valor, within 2 months everyone will just be buying the boes stuff.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone see this as a bad thing for pugs? Now that raiding guilds have to do ZA/ZG to cap their points at the beginning, (and don't give me the &quot;they don't have to do anything&quot; bs, it's progression raiding, if there's a quick way to cap points so that more time can be spent working on bosses, they'll do it.) these guilds are going to be completely unforgiving to any pug that wanders helplessly into the group. I can already see multiple threads coming up from casual players who are sick of getting kicked out of ZA/ZG groups b/c the guild wanted to go faster without them.

Even if they do run alone they are running for the sole purpose of getting those points as fast as possible. They are not there to hold some kids hand through a dungeon that he doesn't want to do in the first place.</div></div><hr />

will be alot faster and less stressful for a alt gear up to be able to enter firelands lol, even dont counting the new 365 items from firelands quests<br />
<br />
People will still do the story-mode tier 11 to ´see the content´and to get tokens for shoulders and helm. People were never going to do it for any other reason since it only drops JP now, which people are, and will be swimming in. This isn´t BC, Blizzard doesn´t want raid guilds to have to grind through old tiers to get a new player up to speed. Anyone who wants to join your tier 12 guild should already have themselves in gear from doing pug heroics. Blizzard is ok with old raids being mostly obsolete.<br />

get vp capped without having to raid = BS<br />
<br />
do the legendary chain without having to down at least ONE prior tier boss = COMPLETE BS<br />
<br />
thanks for making it mean something to raid blizz.... enjoy all the sub cancels<br />
<br />
It is only the wanna-be-hardcores that cry about stuff like this. Real raiders know they will be in heroic raid gear while people doing only heroic 5mans are still buying one or two pieces of tier 12 gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do the 'story-mode' to 'see the content'?? sure they will now that everything will be 20% nerfed... its another free gear giveaway for all the ppl that complained about how hard BoT/BWD/T4W was<br />
<br />
and once these ppl have cleared these instances and get their shiney new 20% nerf gear, and then head off to Firelands (cause they are now geared... and then they will start complaining about Firelands and guess what will happen then.......<br />
<br />
so being 12/12, 3/13 doesnt qualify me to make the statement? sorry since I clearly dont know and am not in a top 10 guild....<br />
<br />
and no, I am not hardcore anymore - havent been since BC</div></div><hr />

You *have* to raid and do heroics to cap the weekly. Instead of the 1.2k its 980. Big deal. Useless items anyway.<br />
<br />
If you haven't cleared cata content and downed the heroic for the last 5-6 months, you clearly don't play world of warcraft. Big deal... nobody cares but you. You get some &quot;shinies&quot; no matter what you do in WoW. How else are they going to keep their subscribers? You really think that the majority of the scrubs playing WoW have even downed all the bosses cata has to offer? Wake up mate. The scrubs get bored with the blues/z'hcs pantsy epics. You need to oil em up to keep em paying. What blizz fail to realize is that there isn't any real competition out there, yet at least, maybe never. They should just say &quot;screw&quot; the scrubs, it's not like they got anywhere else to go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Expectations</div><div class="date">2011-06-12, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay wait so I'm confused. With the new VP cap it means you can get the cap from running Heroics (reg + Zandalari) but not if you don't want to run heroics at all and just raid? If that's the case, then the answer seems easy: They are still trying to force us into doing seven heroics per week just to be geared appropriately.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure you are not FORCED to do anything. You can not do heroics and enjoy the raiding tier, or you can raid / cap the remainder to rush through it and quit 3 months before the next tier...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i loved the fact that you could just go out there and randomly &quot;duel&quot; people in an arena area.<br />
<br />

You still have to kill other bosses in the Firelands for the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, because they tought that it was too &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;hardcore&quot; are for loosers...<br />
<br />
Even if crafting a legendary at the time it's released is alread hardcore stuff...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinykong</div><div class="date">2011-06-13, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The VP changes have nothing to do with gear restriction, and everything to do with populating the Dungeon Finder. If raiders want to cap VP, they have to run heroics or old raid content (which is more likely to happen?) The only problem with this logic, is that it's another band aid. After a few weeks, the raiders will have all the VP gear they want, and the Finder will become a ghost town again.<br />
<br />
There needs to be an incentive to run heroics aside from getting VP and the CTA bags.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omranx</div><div class="date">2011-06-13, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's clear something out for you:<br />
<br />
SC2= 3 races = 3 &quot;classes&quot; to balance<br />
WoW=10 classes x 3 specs each = a total of 30 &quot;classes&quot; to balance<br />
<br />
That's why they are &quot;better&quot; at balancing SC2. Much harder to balance 30 classes/specs than it is to balance 3 races.<br />
<br />
yah but 30 Classes - Pve Classes - Never been used Classes = dunno like 50% less or even more ? depends on ur perception&gt;<br />
plus, we are paying every month for that game, so i dont feel sorry or bad for thoes who work 24 hour to balance, its not like wow is free game.<br />
<br />
and, dk doesnt need buffs at all, they need nerfs not buffs, and they are getting unnecessary buffs. am afraid the next blue notes will say, Dk healing has been increased by 200% .</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all you need to do dailies to even get into the Firelands. It will take you 5 days to enter the Firelands if u do all the dailies (3 dailies!)<br />
When u enter go to the centre of the firelands. There are multiple Molten Lords to find there. They are elite but very easy to kill. <br />
No seriously they are supereasy to kill. <br />
Just kill one, get your quest etc etc.</div></div><hr />
