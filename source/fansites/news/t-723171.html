PTR:Operation Gnomeregan and Zalazane's Fall<br />
The event has been turned off. Thanks for your participation! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25134783720/ptr-operation-gnomeregan-and-zalazane-s-fall/))<br />

&quot;Boring&quot; talents<br />
Every player is going to have a different definition of &quot;boring or bland talents&quot; so that's not going to be a great litmus test. We're probably keeping Improved Overpower. It's the kind of talent that makes Overpower more powerful for an Arms warrior or just makes the ability more powerful in general. Because the talent affects one ability it can have a greater magnitude which is more noticeable than say a 5% damage buff.<br />
<br />
Cruelty is the kind of talent we'll replace (probably by making it affect only a handful of abilities) and tanking talents like Anticipation (if we can get away with it). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172118512/mastery-design-intent/))<br />
<br />
Vigilance<br />
The Taunt renew part of Vigilance is cool and being able to essentially Salv someone can be useful to. Actually gaining threat from using the ability makes it feel like Defiance 2.0 though. You feel like you have to use it all the time (not that that's a huge burden, but still) to achieve the threat levels that other tanks essentially get without the talent.

As a Kitty druid, Vigilance is pretty much the only thing that let's me go all out at the beginning of a fight. It makes me very happy. WTB TotT or a Threat dump.<br />

People are scumbags. Nothing can be done about it. Any popular concert gets the same treatment. I'm sure some people make a living off scalping tickets.<br />
<br />
There really is no way to restrict it so this doesn't happen. The scalpers will always find ways around it. They could do things to try to soften the impact, but tickets will still get scalped.<br />
<br />
The only way to completely stop it, simply will not ever happen - people have to refuse to buy scalped tickets. But they will always sell, because some people are willing to pay.</div></div><hr />

Like instead of a flightpath your party rides this train between cities on a scenic route where you can sit in the cars and chat or defend against heists from the opposing faction. Or boat mounts that you can ride down the canals and rivers of azeroth and maybe some great sea content with wind waker style ship battles would be rad too.</div></div><hr />

Yea man, it's horrible. Having 3 charges, (soon to be 4), having to keybind almost 50% of my keyboard just to be able to operate properly when tanking heroics and flying all over the place, having an arsenal of stuns and of-course, Vigilance... So yea, our talents are really boring, please god Blizz give us more shit to push so we can keep up with your constant nerf-fest.<br />

this is right on point.<br />
i dont know how many people experienced Ozzfest 2007 on this site but let me tell you what a complete fail that was.<br />
<br />
as soon as the queue opened up we tried and tried to get in. we were as patiet as possible but the tickets were all gone in a matter of minutes.<br />
<br />
so i decided to look on ebay because i wanted to make it to this concert, the cheapest tickets i could find were $80 each. thats more than id ever had paid for ozzfest before it was &quot;free&quot; the sad part is that the same seller had multilple listings for different cities.<br />
<br />
so yes i have to agree that there are people who live to make money on tickets like this and as long as their is demand they will keep it up. i dont have any idea of how this could be worked out to benefit people instead of those sellers.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard NEVER listens to feedback - they will only consider something outside their ivory tower if it comes from within their ivory tower before hand. By the time the game gets to beta, they just want to tweak numbers with what they have and will never make any significant changes. <br />
<br />
That wouldn't be so annoying if they (especially GC) weren't so condescending to people and saying their own design is the only right one and that Blizzard doesn't need to listen to fans. Then when their plan goes horribly wrong, they act like they knew it was a problem all along (yet still took them 6 - 9 months to fix).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Starting?!<br />
<br />
Here's a tidbit... I played hunters from original closed beta of the game all the way through to the opening of the Dark Portal events... I played them a smattering here and there after that. I'm now back to playing with one (though not too seriously), and I can guarantee you one thing; They never have, and probably never will, know what they are doing with hunters.<br />
<br />
They've changed the way their abilities work multiple times, have had 2 class overhauls, and have had the core description of the class and its roles changed a myriad of times...<br />
<br />
I think it's basically that they want them as a playable class for a physical ranged dps, but are completely lost as to how to give them a core role and stick with it...<br />
<br />
I'm going to be fair, though. On this matter, I blame mages and rogues (and yes...my main has been a rogue since BC opened) for the problems, as they are the ones that whine the loudest to Blizzard about the hunter class...especially pvp'ers...</div></div><hr />

While fury is one of the most braindead easy DPS specs in the game, warrior is the most demanding tank class, and still often left trailing the other tanks performance wise for far less effort.</div></div><hr />

To the warriors: Do you think the warrior talents are boring?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, flat damage increasers and not enough procs(fury pve) are pretty boring.</div></div><hr />

I'm not, honestly. Cause nothing could be cooler than Wrathgate. &lt;3</div></div><hr />

<br />
And in his mind this sentence not only makes sense, it sounds extra intelligent due to the use of the word 'litmus'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
really.. first they take whirlwind away from our single target dps rotation. then put Heroic Strike on a GCD. now they are taking away our dps increasing talents. it's almost as if blizzard is trying to send a message to us that they don't want us to DPS in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
-in before &quot;but you get it in mastery&quot;... yeah i'm sure blizzard will throw maybe 2% crit as a bonus to us for specing deep into fury. even trade eh?<br />
<br />
good thing i have a lvl 80 DK, Mage, Warlock, Hunter, Paladin, and druid to choose from for dps in cata. because it looks like blizzard stuck (or is still in the process of sticking) the worlds largest fork in us.</div></div><hr />
