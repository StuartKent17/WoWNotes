With the continued popularity of the Dungeon Finder, many players have been asking for a way to group up with real-life friends who play on other realms to take on instances together. Today, we wanted to give you a heads up about a new feature currently in development that will allow players to invite Real ID friends of the same faction to a party regardless of the realm they play on, and then queue up for a 5-player regular or Heroic dungeon.

With the continued popularity of the Dungeon Finder, many players have been asking for a way to group up with real-life friends who play on other realms to take on instances together. Today, we wanted to give you a heads up about a new feature currently in development that will allow players to invite Real ID friends of the same faction to a party regardless of the realm they play on, and then queue up for a 5-player regular or Heroic dungeon.<br />
<br />
As this is a fairly complex service to develop, we don’t have a release date to share quite yet. It’s important to note that as with some of the other convenience- and connectivity-oriented features we offer, certain elements of the cross-realm Real ID party system will be premium-based, though only the player sending the invitations will need to have access to the premium service. We'll have more details to share with you as development progresses -- in the meantime, you may begin to see elements of the feature appear on the World of Warcraft PTR.</div></div><hr />

If you're gonna keep charging for all these external things, you should prolly cut the monthly fee in half.

The idea is very good and hopefully they'll back away with the required payment.<br />
With all these new premium features they should cut the subscription in half.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft has turned into a F2P, only that here you need to pay for the updates -and- the monthly subscription.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- you've to pay a monthly fee<br />
- you've to buy new expansions<br />
- you've to purchase &quot;premium-services&quot; to get access to things which should be free, because:<br />
<br />
- Blizzard also makes money with their Store, with BlizzCon, other in-game services.<br />

This will so fall back on them if they wont re-think it... gl in the future Blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully this will bring about some premium content too. Maybe even some more premium access mounts, though I'd hope the price will be a bit higher to keep things like TRH a bit more exclusive. Like, it would be cooler if TRH would have been like $200+. <br />
<br />
I'd totally be willing to get in on some premium exclusive raid content, especially if it meant paying $150+/month for it. I think I could definitely get more of my friends to play if it was the case.</div></div><hr />

They will, just keep in mind they will be charging you to send those items to other realms.</div></div><hr />

One person can pay for the premium service, or everyone can take it the hard way and pay out the nose for a realm x-fer. It's really a choice of how much you're willing to put in to play with friends if you're on different realms. Most people don't want to have to have mains on every server their friends play on.</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of things I will fault Blizzard for but charging people money for a service is not one of them. You have to pay for things you want.

Pay for a Premium account to play with &quot;friends&quot; on other servers... OR - have these friends transfer to your current server. Unless this premium service is $0.10 then you'd have to be bottom of the food chain to pay for it. I guess they need to make up for the money they lost when myself, and another half a million people, cancelled their accounts.<br />

<br />
It's actually a lot more complex sending items across realms to characters than inviting characters (or pre-organizing groups)<br />
<br />
I don't mind this being paid, if they back away from it being paid, great, but it's only 1 person needing it to be paid, and it's also targeted at a very small group of players so it's not like they'd be making a huge killing off of it.<br />
<br />
It's not like they are charging for the LFD tool itself, so there should be no complains IMO, since this is a secondary service, and not needed.<br />
<br />
You mean I have to PAY to upgrade to FIRST CLASS? WTF IS THIS CRAP?</div></div><hr />

Thats not the point. We already pay a ton of money just to play the game. Its obscene that they're charging money for an ingame feature like crossrealm DF. It should be inclusive.

Agreed. This is also making me afraid of the possibility that the Cross-server BoA items will be a 'premium' feature, too.<br />

Oh wait.<br />
<br />
Blizzard.<br />
<br />
This was a feature that was asked by a large amount of people already. At first I was really excited, because not everyone has the resources to reroll to their friends server. However, this system does not mean anything to such people, since they will not be able to pay for it. <br />
<br />
The argument for it being premium to party leaders is also invalid, since it will make premium players more valuable in the 5man system. Imagine only 1 person having the premium service, other 4 friends have to wait for him in order to play together. What if he's not there that weekend? The other 4 just continues pugging?<br />
<br />
I'm not an economist, but If this is Blizzards policy of a F2P transition, I dislike it. Sure, a lot of the MMO's went from being okay to superawesome by making it F2P + premium services, and sure Blizzards new project Hydra may be one of them, and SURE they want to test it on their playerbase, however this has several negative impacts on the community. <br />
<br />
People without the premium have to still use conventional ways of dungeoning. Guild runs or random. When you do a dungeon with 4 friends, it's just better. Premium players will have access for fast &amp; safe dungeon runs. The argument of &quot;make friends from your server&quot; would be a contradictory one, since the whole point of this new system is the other way around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're joking right? Actually xfering to another server is one thing. That price is completely understandable. You're actually moving a toon to an entire different server with it's contents in order to play with your friends.<br />
<br />
But what about those of us who have friends on other servers but already have obligations? I have a handful of buddies scattered across multiple servers that I'd love to be able to run a dungeon with but can't because we're already dedicated to our guild and respected servers....<br />
<br />
So you're going to charge a premium for me to use a dungeon finder tool? I'm not moving to a server. They're not moving to a server. We just want to play together. Blizzard is just being completely greedy and attempting to make a quick buck considering how fast their losing subscriptions. I'm sorry. But I'll be damned if I'm going to pay to play with friends after I already pay enough as it is for this game and the other &quot;cosmetic or relocation&quot; features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize no one was talking about comparing it with transfering or rerolling? People need to realize that some people might have a guild or other friends on the server they already play on which makes it difficult for them to transfer. For people like this, it would be a nice feature to be able to play with friends who originally rolled on another realm. Playing with friends should not be something you have to pay for.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranor</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed with Mascotte. <br />
<br />
This paid service won't make or break the game. It's an added feature that you can use to play with friends who aren't on your server. You aren't entitled to this by default. You can go ahead and roll an alt on their server if you don't want to use it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'll throw all the money I have at this because I don't have the time to level an alt and gear it up as much as I have my main, but I'd still love to play with some of my friends who play on other servers. <br />
<br />

'Fanboys' aren't asleep -- remember the outcry regarding RealID and the forums overhaul? How Blizzard originally wanted to show people's real names on the forums every time they posted?

<br />
1) How is this being a paid service in any way going to effect your day to day gameplay from how it was before?<br />
<br />
2) &quot;So I can play with my real life friends.... But I have to pay.....&quot; This is not a new concept, it's a concept which has been around for years now, it's called a Paid Character Transfer. If you want to play with your friends free of ALL costs, reroll. <br />
<br />
3) This is not a primary service (It's not the normal LFD tool which they are charging for, nor is it the Auction House, or Guild Chat as a &quot;Premium service&quot;, but secondary features, which do not effect the course of your day to day gameplay, only enhance it. They are not butchering the game removing services that were there before, and inhibit normal gameplay to add a &quot;premium&quot; service to it, no, these are features you would not otherwise notice were there if you didn't know about them, and or purely cosmetic (like pets, and mounts).</div></div><hr />

You're trying hard, but I guess the majority is with me on this matter. And btw, if you still didnt get the massive amount of defense of the community, you'll probably realize when Blizzard starts to bomb us with more premium features in 5-6 months, instead of, you know, releasing content for what we paid already.</div></div><hr />

People need to realize that some people might have a guild or other friends on the server they already play on which makes it difficult for them to transfer. For people like this, it would be a nice feature to be able to play with friends who originally rolled on another realm. Playing with friends should not be something you have to pay for.<br />
<br />
<br />
And its not.<br />
You can play with friends for the monthly fee you pay, you just have to reroll to do so.<br />
Now, most that people do anyway is doing instances and bg's (Im guessing that will be added in the future) correct? <br />
So being able to do that, with 1 guy paying a few bucks more on his sub doesnt sound all that bad.<br />
Sure, if you want to play with friends, besides instances rerolling or a transfer is still the best way to go.<br />
But using instances as a paid service to provide that isnt the end of the world.<br />
<br />
Dont compare it as 'playing with friends' , its playing with friends that are in another world (of warcraft) realm and environment.<br />
They could just as easy say well, reroll or transfer if you want to play with em, and then people demand a feature like this..</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) How is this being a paid service in any way going to effect your day to day gameplay from how it was before?<br />
<br />
2) &quot;So I can play with my real life friends.... But I have to pay.....&quot; This is not a new concept, it's a concept which has been around for years now, it's called a Paid Character Transfer. If you want to play with your friends free of ALL costs, reroll. <br />
<br />
3) This is not a primary service (It's not the normal LFD tool which they are charging for, nor is it the Auction House, or Guild Chat as a &quot;Premium service&quot;, but secondary features, which do not effect the course of your day to day gameplay, only enhance it. They are not butchering the game removing services that were there before, and inhibit normal gameplay to add a &quot;premium&quot; service to it, no, these are features you would not otherwise notice were there if you didn't know about them, and or purely cosmetic (like pets, and mounts).<br />
<br />
Obviously trying too hard, should've made Real-ID a premium service aswell then.<br />
Want to talk with your friends? Make a char on their realm.<br />
See what I did there?<br />
<br />
Want to play with your friends? Too bad, we implemented x-realm LFD finder, use it.<br />
Want to play with your friends that are on your realm? You can make use of our Premium service, only €5 for 10 invites.</div></div><hr />

If you quit, why are you here? Oh yeah you either didn't quit or you still have WoW on your mind. which is almost the same as playing it.<br />
<br />
This website was the very reason I quit WoW. It was this website that allowed me to find &quot;World of Tanks&quot; during its beta phase, a month after playing the beta, I quit WoW. So I come here to hopefully find another gem in the MMO world to play... and I do not have to pay to play... and then pay to pay to play. Also, I love the Warcraft world... I just do not like the game anymore. I still come here to see the story spoilers. I've played Warcraft since it was first released... way back during the dawn of the internet.</div></div><hr />

It’s important to note that as with some of the other convenience- and connectivity-oriented features we offer, certain elements of the cross-realm Real ID party system will be premium-based, though only the player sending the invitations will need to have access to the premium service. We'll have more details to share with you as development progresses -- in the meantime, you may begin to see elements of the feature appear on the World of Warcraft PTR.<br />
<br />
&quot;Premium based&quot; WHAT!? I don't give you ENOUGH of my money to empower you to allow me to play with my friends yet?!<br />
<br />
The way I see it; As I pay-to-play now, I don't believe I should have to pay to Xfer one of my toons (so I don't, simple as that) And now you come out with this idea to &quot;help us have more fun&quot; but we have to pay you even more for that! I do not understand, when will you stop bleeding us dry of both our time &amp; money, to further your success?<br />
<br />
I understand the entire concept of; you create something, I should in-turn have to pay (what is believed) compensation of equal value. But this just takes it to far. It's like going to hospital with no insurance, You pay for them to say they'll help you. But then you have to pay for the medicine too.</div></div><hr />

&quot;...seriously? A premium feature to play with my friends? GTFO.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, so how about you (and everyone of your friends) pay the $10 - $15 bucks a toon to transfer all of your characters to one server... So that is ~ $30 - $45 for 3 toons per person. Oh, and then all of THEIR friend on that server and the guilds they have possibly been in for YEARS have to transfer their characters. Or you get ONE PERSON from you IRL group of friends to pay $3 a month (or whatever it is going to be) for this feature? You can put your money together for convenience and stay on your server and play with all the other friends you have made too. <br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't agree with having to pay, but I will 100% pay whatever the cost for this system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this announcement has made that decision for me.<br />
<br />
Charging extra for the Remote AH/Guild Chat makes sense. You're accessing the game with external devices and has no real effect on gameplay.<br />
Charging extra for Server Transfer/Race changes makes sense. It throttles people's use of the service and keeps population predictable.<br />
Charging extra for Vanity items makes sense. They have no effect on gameplay.<br />
<br />
But this directly effects how you play WoW and, IMO, is unacceptable for a game that already charges a significant monthly fee.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I'm hoping with all these new premium services, the Mobile app, and cross realm Ques, maybe they will be moving to a FREE service game, where to play the general game is free monthly, but if you wish to use these services you'd have to pay?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically, you didn't read a word I just said? I said that some people are unable to reroll or transfer due to already having friends and/or a guild on the server they are currently playing on. The only reason that people are playing on a different realm is because having all the players on one single realm would be impossible, surely you must understand this. Even if they play on a different realm, it's still playing with friends. You can bend and twist it as much as you want, but you can't write &quot;playing with friends that are in another world&quot; without using the words &quot;playing with friends&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is a good feature and should in no way be needed to pay for.</div></div><hr />

If you're gonna keep charging for all these external things, you should prolly cut the monthly fee in half. You're turning into a Free-to-Play style MMO with all sorts of &quot;premiums&quot;...but you still charge a monthly fee.<br />
<br />
Came here to say this exact thing. ^ <br />
<br />
This is truly disgusting. Isn't a fraction of the monthly fee as well as paying for all the expansions supposed to go towards developing content and features? Oh I guess not, it's going towards some new failboat MMO. Ugh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. I just see 6 pages of unjustified whining about a feature that won't actually impact anything at all. If you want the feature, pay for it. I personally think it's crazy enough that RealID is a paid service due to the fact that it involves cross-realm \ game chat, I can completely understand paying for a service that allows you to actually PLAY with someone cross-realm.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krekko</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're joking right? Actually xfering to another server is one thing. That price is completely understandable. You're actually moving a toon to an entire different server with it's contents in order to play with your friends.<br />
<br />
But what about those of us who have friends on other servers but already have obligations? I have a handful of buddies scattered across multiple servers that I'd love to be able to run a dungeon with but can't because we're already dedicated to our guild and respected servers....<br />
<br />
So you're going to charge a premium for me to use a dungeon finder tool? I'm not moving to a server. They're not moving to a server. We just want to play together. Blizzard is just being completely greedy and attempting to make a quick buck considering how fast their losing subscriptions. I'm sorry. But I'll be damned if I'm going to pay to play with friends after I already pay enough as it is for this game and the other &quot;cosmetic or relocation&quot; features.<br />
<br />
The point is the benefit of selectively playing with friends.<br />
<br />
To do it before you had to pay or not play at all.<br />
<br />
You can now pay a small price and play when you like, while still keeping your obligations to your server and guild.<br />
<br />
Or, you can go back to not playing with friends at all.<br />
<br />
Point is &quot;Playing with friends&quot; is not considered a necessary aspect of the game of the game to accomodate if said friends are on a different server, especially since there is this completely reasonable and 100% free option called rerolling. They are charging (only one person too, mind you), not for the LFD tool, that's still 100% free, but for the ability to invite RealID friends so you can do dungeons together.<br />
<br />
Is it &quot;greedy&quot;, perhaps, but by that, most of everything should be free related to the game and the subscription fee should be $5, the point is it's not unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

I hope you enjoy when the auction house costs $5 a month. You can trade person to person. After all, that's what the trade chat is for.<br />

And btw, if you still didnt get the massive amount of defense of the community, you'll probably realize when Blizzard starts to bomb us with more premium features in 5-6 months, instead of, you know, releasing content for what we paid already.<br />
<br />
<br />
But thats not the case right now.<br />
Sure, if they start releasing ingame content for premium accounts i'm with you, that shouldnt happen.<br />
HC Ragnaros only if the raidleader has Premium function X or something.<br />
That will kill wow.<br />
But a feature that allows you to use an ingame function to do something you currently cant, and cant expect to be able to since WoW was never released to be cross-server playable (Thats kinda the point of having server-worlds) can cost money.<br />
And as said, you dont have to use it; the 'old' options are still there.<br />
But being able to group with all your irl friends (since you might have those spread across multiple servers, not just 1) costing a small fee is just fine imo.</div></div><hr />

Out of game services, sure, moving my toon... ok.. but renaming my character is a fee? seriously? Pay a premium for a cross dungeon platform that kind of already exists? Hell no. Some people say re-roll, or pay an xfer fee. I've already paid over 250 in xfer fees in the 5 years I've been playing. I had a guild that I was a part of and didnt want to xfer. I dont want to level a toon just to play with friends. I can think of a hundred reasons why I wouldnt want to pay for this. How about ... I already pay 3$ for remote auction, and another 15 for my sub, and another what maybe 3 more bucks a month for this? By the time we're done im paying over 20 a month. <br />
<br />
All I have to say is RIFT. I played it for 30 mins before I bought it and I have not looked back at Warcraft since (Been playing for almost 6 weeks now). Warcraft has turned into a bloated pig. They charge a &quot;Premium&quot; for things that should be part of the game, add-ons are a mess, the client runs on Warcraft III technology (thats 12 years old for those who dont know).. the list goes on. <br />

Try rift for 7 days and you'll be hooked, I guarantee it. Use my RAF key below. If you don't like it, I will paypal you a dollar. (Well.. not really)<br />

I know it's tough when you have to beg mommy to pay your subscription every month or wrack up even more credit card debt since you can't stop buying shit you don't need, but this is the real world and services have prices, and additional services have additional prices. If you don't want to pay for an additional service, then don't; it's that simple. You choose how your spend your money, not anyone else.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure why so many MMO players feel entitled. All you really pay for is access to current content. If you want more then you have to pay for it. Regardless of what you think you do not pay for the content added in patches, it's given freely to entice you to continue to subscribe. This feature is just going to happen to require additional money if you want to use it. You don't currently have it so you're not losing anything.</div></div><hr />

You don't selectively choose those people.<br />
<br />
The way this works is you can flat out invite people to your group via your realID window. That takes much more to implement than shuffling people into one dungeon server. <br />

Sure, if they start releasing ingame content for premium accounts i'm with you, that shouldnt happen.<br />
HC Ragnaros only if the raidleader has Premium function X or something.<br />
That will kill wow.<br />
But a feature that allows you to use an ingame function to do something you currently cant, and cant expect to be able to since WoW was never released to be cross-server playable (Thats kinda the point of having server-worlds) can cost money.<br />
And as said, you dont have to use it; the 'old' options are still there.<br />
But being able to group with all your irl friends (since you might have those spread across multiple servers, not just 1) costing a small fee is just fine imo.<br />
<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
They are not preventing normal gameplay by this.<br />
<br />
You won't be shorted out of anything that you had before because of this.<br />
<br />
You can still use the LFD tool after this.<br />
<br />
You're just paying for the non-necessary feature of playing with off-realm friends, you're not entitled to that, and if they were to give it to you for free, great, but if they uphold charging for it that's fine.<br />

With the continued popularity of the Dungeon Finder, many players have been asking for a way to group up with real-life friends who play on other realms to take on instances together. Today, we wanted to give you a heads up about a new feature currently in development that will allow players to invite Real ID friends of the same faction to a party regardless of the realm they play on, and then queue up for a 5-player regular or Heroic dungeon.<br />
<br />
As this is a fairly complex service to develop, we don’t have a release date to share quite yet. It’s important to note that as with some of the other convenience- and connectivity-oriented features we offer, certain elements of the cross-realm Real ID party system will be premium-based, though only the player sending the invitations will need to have access to the premium service. We'll have more details to share with you as development progresses -- in the meantime, you may begin to see elements of the feature appear on the World of Warcraft PTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Man if they open this up to raiding...this is going to be awesome.<br />
<br />
Imagine all the epic raiders selling their services cross realm. You too could pay to have a renowned world player come and play in your raid.<br />
<br />
I can see it now...a whole new gold selling service.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madmonk</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">paying for this? why? the is based upon playing with friends, they really want us to pay even more? i'd love to hear what TB has to say about this on his next azdaily.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Halicia</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This tool is LONG overdue, but having to pay extra for a fully automated queue system makes as little sense to me as having to pay for the existing queue system.<br />
<br />
This isn't 'entitlement', its just that a tool that would make the game a LOT more fun for me (by allowing me to queue up various level alts on diff servers with my less-active reallife friends), isnt going to be used. My reallife friends wont be using this tool, most of them barely stay subscribed to WoW as it is...<br />
<br />
I personally won't be paying extra for this tool. So I'm kinda stuck with 'unless this ONE friend is on, none of us can play together'.<br />
<br />
And this is where I find fault with it... its a tool to facilitate the community.... but then they put a gate in front of it, so the community cant enter it.<br />
<br />
What if they started making raids 'premium content', you know how annoying it'd be trying to put together a raid team THEN ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because this is something other MMO's have for years now? Oh wait, they don't. While I don't like this premium shit, I believe that it's fairly complex to do, especially if you take the massive of code that is World of Warcaft into account.<br />
<br />
As a software developer, I don't buy that as an explaination why it will cost extra. It can't be that complex and they sure as hell have both the menpower and the time (which won't be soooo long) to develop this feature for &quot;free&quot;. Free as in &quot;you're already paying 13$/15€ per month for this game already anyway&quot;.<br />
<br />
Those guys already made the crossserver dungeon finder, AFAIK every server in the US is now in a single battleground pool, and they made you able to chat with other players on other realms and even in other blizzard games via RealID. Dungeon finder with a few fixed members from your realID list probably isn't far away from that code.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard has a history of consistently putting out great games, with very few bugs (in comparision), great balance (again, in comparision) and with a very openended design that allowed countless of mods to thrive. The engine wow runs on has gotta be really well designed, seeing as how much they put into it over time with it still being amazingly stable. Very few features (especially once that use already established for free modules, such as realid and the cross-realm dungeon finder) are gonna be so hard to code into that without charging ADDITIONAL monthly fees for it to be worth it.<br />
<br />
Guil Chat and Remote auction house with extra monthly fee? Well... it should really be free of charge already, but it does add a genuine new functionality and isn't needed ingame so I can kinda see why they charge for it (though again, should be free). But playing with friends on other servers WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY? Should be goddamn free without a doubt.<br />
<br />

But just for heroics? Eehh. I don't play enough anymore to really pay for that. I wonder what else is included in this &quot;premium&quot; account now, though? Or are they referring to the premium addition for guild chat on your phone and auction house use?<br />
<br />
It seems a bit silly to make this a pay item, but. *shrug* Personally I don't know enough folks on other servers anymore to do this myself.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szilia</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The service is fine - a pretty neat idea actually and one I'd look forward to. If it is to be free.<br />
I don't mind Blizz having a premium account for their mobile department as that is truly something outside the game, that you can easily do at your computer for free. But making premium accounts have any kind of benefit ingame is just plain wrong.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shoju</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Premium Service? Really? No thanks. I will stick to playing with guildies, and not using Real ID at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mascotte</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically, you didn't read a word I just said? I said that some people are unable to reroll or transfer due to already having friends and/or a guild on the server they are currently playing on. The only reason that people are playing on a different realm is because having all the players on one single realm would be impossible, surely you must understand this. Even if they play on a different realm, it's still playing with friends. You can bend and twist it as much as you want, but you can't write &quot;playing with friends that are in another world&quot; without using the words &quot;playing with friends&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is a good feature and should in no way be needed to pay for.<br />
<br />
But it has been impossible for 6 years.<br />
Why is a change in that system that allows you to do some parts of wow with people on other realms suddenly something that should be free?<br />
You haven't been able to do that in the previous 6 years and people somehow managed with re-rolling, transferring or just not doing it.<br />
<br />
And think of it from a marketing or even business PoV:<br />
They saw a drop in numbers, they need to make up that loss by either getting more subs or filling the gap with some premium stuff, correct?<br />
Why spend development time on something free that will only be used for a specific group of your players base while a major chunk of them dont care at all?<br />
This not costing money would have likely ended up in this not being created, since its not worth the time invested.<br />
<br />
Content for premium accounts=bad, services for premium accounts isnt that bad?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimlow</div><div class="date">2011-05-17, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meh, like all premium content I could take it or leave it. Most of it really is completely un-necessary unless you are addicted.<br />
<br />
- Pet's (totaly useless, I hardly even notice them and rarely even see anyone with them out save the avid collector)<br />
- Celestial Steed Mount (cool looking and nice if you have a bunch of alts but totally un-necessary)<br />
- paid name change (put more thought into your name before you make it)<br />
- race change (un-necessary unless your really give a damn about racials or your friends up and decide to switch factions)<br />
- class change (not yet implemented give it time :))<br />
- realm transfer (only service that is actually useful but very much over priced)<br />
- auction house on your phone/computer? (seriously does your phone need to be more a distraction then it already is)<br />
- paid mobile guild chat (again only for the severely hardcore that cant be separate from the game for a minute and only)<br />
<br />
- which brings us to this paid LFG changes via Real ID friends. For the most part I would assume that if you play this game you play it with your friends. I would also assume that if you play with your friends you would all roll on the same realm hence no need for this service. Honestly I don't know who they are gearing this service to? Who would play this game with friends but not just roll characters on that persons realm? if your guild disbanded and people jumped realm why not just pay the one time transfer fee for your main?</div></div><hr />

It's just one step closer to servers meaning nothing. <br />
<br />
For the reasons that it's so grossly optional, they can charge for it if they want. Not a big deal really. <br />

Now if it allowed you to do raids (perhaps it still will!) and you could have guilds across servers, now that'd be worth my interest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion of course, and I'm doing my best not to point fingers and stuff, but I can't say that I agree with you even the slightest. I can pay the monthly subscription to play the game, but I still consider the fact that playing with my friends is free since I'm not charged extra for it (until now).<br />
Perhaps it's naïve of me, but I believe that if you have to pay even the smallest fee to play with your friends and/or family is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
I like WoW and have defended it a lot and I've been playing for six years, watching Blizzard do one stupid move after another (with some good ones inbetween)... but this is just about enough of a reason for me to quit. I know it's optional and all that, but I have my beliefs and I'm going to hold on to them. It's all about principles.<br />
<br />
<br />
But it has been impossible for 6 years.<br />
Why is a change in that system that allows you to do some parts of wow with people on other realms suddenly something that should be free? <br />
With that logic I could say that raiding the Firelands should be something only premium accounts can do, seeing as it's been impossible up until now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actual it is more complicated.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked the cross realm dungeon finder only works with realms in your battlegroup. Battlegroups are limited to one data center so they don't have to worry too much about how the data gets from data center to data center and if they need to do any encryption or special handling of the data.<br />
<br />
This is extending it to all players not matter what battlegroup they are in. Spanning data centers. May seem like a minor point to you but even so this does add another layer of complexity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- We are preparing to launch a new way to playing our game to our players in the next patch. Patch 4.4 will introduce 3 new 5 player dungeons and daily quest hubs in Twilight Highlands. Not only are we giving you new content, we are introducing a new system on how our players interact with the content. Patch 4.4 will introduce the Premium account! For a small fee players will unlock a premium account which will allow them to do even more things in the Warcraft world. <br />
<br />
+ New haircuts, new skin colors, new facial features and the introduction of tattoos! <br />
+ Players will also have access to the dance studio to create new dances for their characters!<br />
+ With the new 4.4 5 man dungeons were are introducing &quot;Premium&quot; mode... which will be just a bit harder than Heroic mode and will reward the players with &quot;Premium Points&quot; which they can turn in to the &quot;Premium Vendor&quot; to buy the current level of epics from raid content! Any item from any boss will be on the &quot;Premium Vendor&quot; including Legendary items. Earlier 5 man dungeons will be folded into the Premium system in later patches.<br />
+ Premium mounts and pets.<br />
+ Cross-Realm Dungeon feature will also finally release!<br />
+ Premiun players will also be able to access the LFR system. LFR system is much like LFD except it will allow players to randomally queue for 10/25 player raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem I'm hearing in this thread is that it's going to be hard to convince your parents to pony up so you can play w/ off-server friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buuuut, maaaaaaaaa'aaaaaaaam!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously. I'll bet Blizz would be happy to trade you inflation on their monthly fee for everything 'Premium' they will ever sell. Think about how much more expensive energy and everything else is than it was 7 years ago. Think about how many CS people they had to hire just to help the millions of unwashed compewter newbs that can't keep key loggers off their systems.<br />
<br />
Sure, I would really love it if they had a clear demarcation between a team that we paid our $15 a month to for further development, and the team that designs bonus 'Premium' content, but that's just not how game dev works.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that the pricing they announce isn't even going to turn a profit- it's likely going to be just enough to break even, so that they wouldn't be diverting resources.<br />
<br />

<br />
There are people saying they &quot;spend tons of money&quot; on World of Warcraft already. What?<br />
How is World of Warcraft tons of money? It's $14.99 a month at worst. That's less than the cost of going to see a movie at a theater when you count a small popcorn and drink. Less than the cost of eating out one time. The value is fricking insane as it is for the amount of hours of entertainment you get out of that single $14.99 per month. I am not surprised they are offering a premium service for features that aren't inside the general scope of the game. It's not like they are selling &quot;Premium Raid Content.&quot; That would be insane, but they would never do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I checked the cross realm dungeon finder only works with realms in your battlegroup. Battlegroups are limited to one data center so they don't have to worry too much about how the data gets from data center to data center and if they need to do any encryption or special handling of the data.<br />
<br />
This is extending it to all players not matter what battlegroup they are in. Spanning data centers. May seem like a minor point to you but even so this does add another layer of complexity.<br />
<br />
I could have swore battlegroups were done away with (as far as match making restrictions) around 4.0.3 and BGs and RDF just pulled from anyone within your region.</div></div><hr />

i dont see why they should. this is not something you MUST have to enjoy the game. its something that is an extra feature that will require some extensive development. if mailing items cross servers to your own toons is such an issue then i can only imagine the amount of work something like this would require. IMO blizz is adding something very amazing with this feature, and from a business pov it only makes sense that they make it a premium service</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm willing to bet that the pricing they announce isn't even going to turn a profit- it's likely going to be just enough to break even, so that they wouldn't be diverting resources.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can they already put us into cross-realm dungeons? Check.<br />
Can we already be in a cross-realm party chat outside of that dungeon? Check.<br />
Can we alredy chat with friends on other realms or in other bliz games? Check.<br />
<br />
They already have all those things. Writing a module that uses those won't be hard or take long.</div></div><hr />

This completely in-game feature isn't in line with their original vision for this service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did pay for Firelands, the moment you paid for your Cataclysm copy.<br />
But then its called an expansion, and not a premium service.<br />
<br />
Once you buy Cata, or any of the old expansions, you buy any changes made up to that point, including the first raid tier etc (So lets call that 4.0)<br />
And you get severall content patches attached to that (Including Firelands).<br />
<br />
A Wotlk account cant play Firelands, since they haven't bought the 'premium upgrade' to get to play Cataclysm and thus Firelands.<br />
You made the argument for me tho;<br />
Buying WoW vanilla only gets you so much, want more, pay more.<br />
We have been using paid services for years, we just called them differently.<br />
<br />
And yes, you dont have to agree, thats just fine, but i cant help but think i understand that they wont release this for free, since that would hinder them more then they would benefit from it.</div></div><hr />

Saying stuff like this, implies you don't understand how things properly work.. For example, I buy a fish tank, rocks, filter, the whole bit.... Then one of the fish ask to be fed and I tell them, &quot;That would be too complex&quot; They created the entire system, how can doing anything with-in that system hinder them that much, if at all?<br />

Man... your logic is so full of fail. So, since he bought Cataclysm he bought all of the new services to come along which would include content patches? So that means he also bought Cross-Realm Dungeons? Cross-Realm Dungeons, under your example, is called an Expansion not a premium service. *sigh*<br />

LoL holy ignorance, batman! would you rather they dont offer those things at all? didnt think so. Why should you be able to change your name, race, faction, server when ever you want at all? most games wouldnt let you do that at all. if you dont want to pay for this then DONT. We have been playing wow for a better part of the decade without these features so just continue to do so like nothing happened.

So shouldn't this have been included in the expansion box too, then? Seeing as it's an updated released after the expansion was. What I meant was exactly what you were saying but with different words - Updates like these should have already been payed for by the monthly subscription as well as the cost of the expansion box. Paying additional money for updates like these to simply play with your friends is stupid, especially when we've already payed for features like these times and times again already.<br />
<br />
And as others said, I guess I'm biased since I don't think that premium features have a place in a P2P MMO. But I see your point like I said, everyone's entitled to their opinion. Now I'm headed for sleep. It's getting late here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully this will bring about some premium content too. Maybe even some more premium access mounts, though I'd hope the price will be a bit higher to keep things like TRH a bit more exclusive. Like, it would be cooler if TRH would have been like $200+. <br />
<br />
I'd totally be willing to get in on some premium exclusive raid content, especially if it meant paying $150+/month for it. I think I could definitely get more of my friends to play if it was the case.<br />
<br />
