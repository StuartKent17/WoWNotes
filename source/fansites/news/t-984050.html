In all seriousness though it seems like they actually took onboard the feedback from the forums for shadow (having a way to generate 3x Shadow orbs on the pull now, and &quot;kind of&quot; pulling SWD into line above 25% HP, its nice to see feedback been used. Who knows maybe some of these bonuses will make it through to the next exp as generalised abilities.</div></div><hr />

We're intent on getting the 4.3 Public Test Realms up potentially within the next week. :) As you mentioned, there's still a lot of work to be done on this patch, so a lot of the content will be rolled onto the test realms over time. Transmogrification, Void Storage, some balance changes, and several UI updates/improvements will likely make the PTR right away. The dungeon/raid content, legendary questline, Dungeon Finder updates, and especially Raid Finder are still very much works in-progress.&quot; Zarhymn</div></div><hr />

(edit: I meant 4-piece bonus).<br />
<br />
It'll depend on how well you can manage your mana, so I suspect it'll take a bit to get used to unless you only use arcane power when evocation is up. If nothing else, it's still a near 500 permanent haste bonus.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm gonna love this as a fire mage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZenX</div><div class="date">2011-09-25, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nerdgasm at both Blood and Frost set bonuses(Blood 2p is not that amazing though) and the 4p Blood is just pure imba if it goes live it will be arguably the best raid CD, even better than other tank's 4p bonuses(when Vampiric Blood glyph is active of course)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocd6ad878d9b</div><div class="date">2011-09-25, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warlock2P -- The duration of your Doomguard and Infernal summons is increased by [15|45] sec and the cooldown of of those spells is reduced by 4 min. (45 for Demonology, 15 for non--Demonology.)-Yes, thank you. Finally. Thank you thank you. Tho kinda funny how this will fix progression fights where you fight on 2-3 mins and maybe wipe then try again with no major cooldown. Should be this way but good direction.<br />
4P -- Soulburn grants a 10% increase to your spell power for 10 sec.Eh? What? This is more confusing and kinda boring. 10 seconds? Thats hardly anything really.<br />
4P -- Your Arcane Shot ability has a chance to grant 25% haste to you and your pet for 10 sec.Placeholder or MM focused tier? It should have explosive shot and maybe kill command too.VERY intresting bonuses for tanks. Raid healing cooldown bonus? Shieldwall raid? Woah. Either theres gonna be lot of cooldown use on T13 or thats gonna be sick. So gonna get nerfed next xpack tho. Imagine having like warrior just to use that gear to get raid-wide swall.</div></div><hr />

To make it any useful the crit proc chance should be at least close to 50% and/or execute should be able to be used long before that magical 20% barrier... 2 set bonus other hand might get useful again on fury, when aligning HS to be accompanied with inner rage macro. However it probably will only net you having 1 extra HS once a while so I can't really see any warriors getting any tier part if the stats are any bad - except for the looks of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is going to be mind-blowingly amazing for us Frosts, only thing that I fear is that as having been given the best of the set bonuses why do I have the feeling that we may be getting the worst-looking tier among t13, elseway, the set is awesome aswell, I'll assume my constant nagging and claim class getting erased rather than being deemed the red-headed child of the game has paid off, yet I'm still sceptic.<br />

Death Knight: 20% Increased healing every minute for 15 seconds(Glyphed, though if not, kick that tank out of the group)<br />
Paladin: 20% raid-wide damage reduction every 2 minutes<br />
Warrior: 25% raid-wide damage recuction every 3 minutes<br />

The 4 piece is effectively a carbon copy of the tier 12 4 piece, except that we will just be casting Starsurge on CD rather than waiting and planning on when it will be most useful. And the 2 piece is just plain uninteresting. A flat 3% damage on nukes is boring design.And I'm concerned about how Moonkin will upgrade their tier. The idea of losing the t12 4p is very unappealing, particularly when the t13 2p is reliant on DoT uptime. I'm almost concerned that Moonkin might have to wait until we can upgrade the 4p into the other 4p. But I have no solid math to back this up, so I'll be quiet.I really like that all tanks will be getting a raid damage prevention CD, however. That is the kind of new, creative, interesting thing we should be seeing in every class's tier sets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The supposed pre-nerf version was retarded as it allowed it to absorb damage equal x% of Paladin's health and such mechanic, being revised to a flat-out damage reduction, though I must agree it being less-useful compared to what other tanks got, it would have been better if the reduction on the CD of the ability was 30 seconds with the absorb increased by 10~20% as it lasts 6 seconds compared to other ones lasting more than double the amount, so that it would be balanced, else it may come to benching Prot Paladins for 4.3 with DK and Warrior tanks being the favorites...</div></div><hr />

<br />
shaman enhancement:<br />
•Enhancement, 2P -- While you have any stacks of Maelstrom Weapon, your Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and healing spells deal 20% more healing or damage.<br />
•Enhancement, 4P -- Your Feral Spirits have a 45% chance to grant you a charge of Maelstrom Weapon each time they deal damage.<br />
rubbish this throws off my rotation to casting more lightning bolts with the 4 set, although thats only once every 3 minutes HOW BAD ARE THESE BONUSES?, 2 set when do you cast any of those unless you have 5 stacks anyway? maelstrom weapon procs quite enough anyway, if it increased ALL damage by 2% per stack i think thatd work way better<br />
<br />
hunter survival:<br />
•2P -- Steady Shot and Cobra Shot generate double the amount of focus.<br />
•4P -- Your Arcane Shot ability has a chance to grant 25% haste to you and your pet for 10 sec.<br />
Cant fault this set bonus brilliant<br />
<br />
paladin ret:<br />
•Retribution, 2P -- Your Judgement ability has a 50% chance to generate 1 Holy Power.<br />
•Retribution, 4P -- While Zealotry is active your abilities deal 12% more damage.<br />
again nice set bonuses think 2set should be 100% though<br />

deathknight frost:<br />
•DPS, 2P -- Sudden Doom has a 30% chance and Rime has a 60% chance to grant 2 charges when triggered instead of 1.<br />
•DPS, 4P -- Runic Empowerment has a 25% chance and Runic Corruption has a 40% chance to also grant 710 mastery rating for 12 sec when activated.<br />
2p not great but ok i suppose, throws in an extra hb if your waiting for runes to c/d<br />
4p seems more focused on unholy if you ask me as they would benefit and get more procs from it than a frost dk</div></div><hr />

your own personal bloodlust on 2 minute cooldown, that you can couple with 2 set for 25% cheaper heals for the duration is worst of all healers? I think the other healers will envy shamans when the raid healing gets tough, and all they have are random procs. Is it as good for padding meters? no.

<br />
Eh, depends on how you look at it. The biggest advantage DG will have over the others, really, is that the other tanking classes can't separate their personal cooldowns from their raid cooldowns. The warrior who wants to protect himself OR the raid must hit Shield Wall, and do both at the same time. Divine Guardian is still separate from Guardian of Ancient Kings, letting the Paladin do both at the same time, or at different times, depending. <br />
<br />
Of course, that's how it is now, so the 4p bonuses will certainly close the gap. If anything, I'd argue that the prot pally 4p bonus is the weakest of the tanking 4p bonuses, but because they were already OP in that regard so that the gap is just a bit smaller now.</div></div><hr />

disc priest on the other hand seems much better (again). PI doesn't even take a gcd to activate + 4pc is just &gt;&gt;&gt; holy bonus<br />

-2pc is nice, adds up and is nice for soloing content. ;)<br />

looks like all healers got screwed on their tier pieces. very strong dps and tanking tier bonus's .. and what it seems to me is that they area bout to lay down alot of raid damage hence the lower costs of spells. and the +healing from several of the tanking/dps set bonuses (blood dk and feral regeneration to name 2)<br />
<br />
last but not least. .im kinda tired of the difficulty of the raid being squarely on the shoulders of the healers. there are other mechanics they can use to make something difficult that doesnt require healing someone from near death.</div></div><hr />

Mitigation is flat-out better than extra health, thus making the druid/DK bonuses inferior to the warrior/pally bonuses. Second, the paladin 4p bonus doesn't really provide anything significant to paladins, meaning paladins are probably the only tanking class that won't bother getting the 4p bonus in this tier.<br />
<br />
It's hard to argue that the paladin bonus should be better since their raid cooldown isn't tied to their personal cooldown, but it's kind of weird that the t13 4p bonus is just providing an inherent paladin ability to the other tanking classes. Why not just give all the other tanks a new raid wall ability in the patch and not try to half-ass balance the tank classes with a set bonus?</div></div><hr />

<br />
shaman enhancement:<br />
•Enhancement, 2P -- While you have any stacks of Maelstrom Weapon, your Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and healing spells deal 20% more healing or damage.<br />
•Enhancement, 4P -- Your Feral Spirits have a 45% chance to grant you a charge of Maelstrom Weapon each time they deal damage.<br />
rubbish this throws off my rotation to casting more lightning bolts with the 4 set, although thats only once every 3 minutes HOW BAD ARE THESE BONUSES?, 2 set when do you cast any of those unless you have 5 stacks anyway? maelstrom weapon procs quite enough anyway, if it increased ALL damage by 2% per stack i think thatd work way better<br />
<br />
hunter survival:<br />
•2P -- Steady Shot and Cobra Shot generate double the amount of focus.<br />
•4P -- Your Arcane Shot ability has a chance to grant 25% haste to you and your pet for 10 sec.<br />
Cant fault this set bonus brilliant<br />
<br />
paladin ret:<br />
•Retribution, 2P -- Your Judgement ability has a 50% chance to generate 1 Holy Power.<br />
•Retribution, 4P -- While Zealotry is active your abilities deal 12% more damage.<br />
again nice set bonuses think 2set should be 100% though<br />
<br />
rogue sub:<br />
PvP character doesnt matter<br />
<br />
deathknight frost:<br />
•DPS, 2P -- Sudden Doom has a 30% chance and Rime has a 60% chance to grant 2 charges when triggered instead of 1.<br />
•DPS, 4P -- Runic Empowerment has a 25% chance and Runic Corruption has a 40% chance to also grant 710 mastery rating for 12 sec when activated.<br />
2p not great but ok i suppose, throws in an extra hb if your waiting for runes to c/d<br />
4p seems more focused on unholy if you ask me as they would benefit and get more procs from it than a frost dk</div></div><hr />

Can't remember if I have ever seen this imbalanced set bonus before. For one spec 700k+ extra damage and for the other two I would say around 100k. 4 set bonus is decent. 1-1.5k depending how it lines with procs. Might be a bit more. Haven't really checked my max possible spell power with all the procs on. It's pretty good if you weren't using shards for anything else. Thou this presents interesting idea for afflis. Everytime your Soulburned Seed explodes it will refund the shard back. So you could Soulburn once between Demon Soul CD as you have unlimited shards. Definetly worth it if there's 2 or more targets. Might be worth even with one target depending what math says.</div></div><hr />

They didn't have a problem with Warriors doing that by making Rallying Cry baseline, so expect much of the same.<br />
<br />
But seeing all of the tank 4-piece bonuses relating to raid-wide cooldowns makes me wonder if they're just going to add more AoE pulses to encounters, since it appears that Blizzard thinks adding more AoE damage makes for &quot;skill&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why can't you? Unless I'm looking at the cooldowns incorrectly, mana gem is 2 minutes, arcane power is 1.5 mins, and this bonus makes it go down to 1 minute, so now instead of waiting 30 seconds past when arcane power is available to use it with the mana gem, you'll just use it every minute and have another one ready for the mana gem.</div></div><hr />

Ehhh..I dont necessarily agree with you. Not saying your wrong or I'm right, just a difference of opinion. I personally think that when you use mana tide its obviously when you need mana and what better time to conserve mana then right then. If you don't need mana then why conserve it if your not having problems with it lol. But hey again, just my opinion..and you know what they say about opinions! =D</div></div><hr />

That's why I think the &quot;50% of the effect&quot; thing on the warrior and dk set applies to the duration as well (Note that talents make the warrior shield wall a 2 minute cooldown as well unless they also use a glyph for a bigger damage reduction).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, and the bonus is super cool, when you place the lightwell before you actually pull the boss, so the CD is shorter during the fight. Holy bonuses are crap. The 4p is equally bad if not crappier, 'cause Holy Word spells are not used at all prime time.<br />
<br />
There might be some class changes in the plans that make those bonuses useful, but as the holy priest is now, they are complete and utter shit, weather you like it or not, every holy priest will tell you that. I'm pretty sure those will get revisited pretty soon. <br />
<br />
Also look at shadow 2p? What about masochism, wont work anymore with the 2p? It just makes no sense.<br />
<br />
P.S.: The raid doesn't even know what a Lightwell is anymore, since 99,9% healing priests are DISC due to the shit throughput of HOLY.</div></div><hr />

Assuming all specs use arcane shot to dump focus, put the odd hard casting MM aside, You get more focus from study shot, that end up with more focus to dump to arcane shots that increase your haste thus the study shot cast rate and the passive focus regain, and that itself get you even more arcane shots.<br />

Serenity is actually a very powerful instant-heal , and it increases the crit chance for a heal on the target by 25%, including HoTs. I WOULD agree, however, that HW: Sanctuary is a weak HW spell, because it has a huge mana cost and is very situational - I can only think of a few fights Sanctuary is useful for. Granted, the passive bonuses from Chakra: Sanctuary are nice (15% increased healing from Renew and AoE heals, and 2sec reduced cooldown on circle of healing), but they certainly don't make up for HW:Sanctuary.It's funny to me that these bonuses seem to be catering to Discipline priests, when I've somewhat associated the Discipline spec to PVP as opposed to PVE. Regardless, my opinion still stands that the priest set-bonuses need some major changes to make getting the set worthwhile as Holy.</div></div><hr />

It's just going to get nerfed going in to t13 like the balance t11 bonus did.<br />

Also, boomkin t13 4p is pretty terrible. =/</div></div><hr />

I don't think it'll be OP, probably has a fairly low proc chance, and lets face it, spamming Arcane is no way to dominate dps charts, but weaving one in here and there, thanks to the added focus regen, could really spice things up. So now I don't care what my armor looks like. Could be a thong and nipple tassels for my male dwarf. Whatever it is, this is going to be a great set if the don't make changes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tradu</div><div class="date">2011-09-25, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just looking at them, and not knowing everything about all classes, pretty much all of them seem amazing. <br />
For the classes I actually play, the mage ones seem interesting, the 2p will reduce the priority of haste by quite a lot for arcane, and the 4p will most likely change the arcane playstyle a lot. <br />
The feral DPS 2p sounds pretty amazing(execute phase from 60% instead of 25%?) and the 4p sounds like they want to make the run-out-and-charge-back-in version of the feral priority list a reasonably big DPS increase, instead of being pretty much worthless now that you actually have to run out, and can't just charge bosses while standing behind them. The DK DPS 2p sounds more beneficial to unholy than frost, because outside of a shadowfrost/mastery build, there isn't always room to even fit in the one stack of Rime. <br />
And for ret, which I have played. I think Blizzard likes making the specc a RNGfest. 50% chance to gain a holy power from Judgement? Should be good, but still, ret pallies are probably getting tired of the amount of RNG in the spec.<br />
Overall, Blizzard at least managed one thing: not having all 2p boni be just &quot;10% damage/5% crit to some random ability&quot;. All of these look way more interesting than that.</div></div><hr />

The duration of your Doomguard and Infernal summons is increased by [15|45] sec and the cooldown of of those spells is reduced by 4 min. (45 for Demonology, 15 for non--Demonology.) That's nice.. wait, what? Either the Doomguard will get nerfed or this set bonus will be changed. There is no way they'll let Demon locks get this on live. Reduction in CD idea is nice. I would have preferred another option to be able to use it every try, but for now it will do. Becomes a moot point if they're going to nerf the triple mastery gain from the DG though. Demon as a spec will be crap then and for Aff or Destro the DG is a very minor dps factor anyway. <br />
4P -- Soulburn grants a 10% increase to your spell power for 10 sec. Lackluster. The idea to boost Soulburn a bit via tier bonus isn't a bad idea, but the bonus is too short and underwhelming. Compared to 4T12 which randomly procs 20% for 8 seconds the only advantage it has is that you have control over when it works. But with 4-5 4t12 procs per bossfight the 4t12 outperforms the 4t13, and it was a small dps increase to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vyragosa</div><div class="date">2011-09-25, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for melee classes keep in mind that our 2 set bonus (Warrior, Rogues, Ret pallies etc) or even 4 set is not like other casters since Blizz state there will be a raid-wide buff for melee across the board that increase damage so it must scale with that. For my part I play a warrior and I think It's good that HS cost lest rage when Inner Rage is up specially if your spec into insight and have Battle Trance you can get more out of it without using it twice and 3 times to dump rage and be rage starving when the target is below 20% and you have your 5 stack of execution, I can see that coming pretty handy but again like they state it can change until the final release! But overall I'm quite happy with them Tanking is just amazing lol! DPS not bad :) But that is just my own opinion!</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL the ele bonuses are pretty weak. <br />
400 mastery for 15s every 75s? um yea, 80 mastery overall wut? :D easily replaced by more optimal gear, if we get aain several crit pieces.<br />
The second sounds better, but is still heavily rng and not that powerful either, totem drops, shocks and AoEing make this really medicore setbonus.<br />
<br />
Hell, the resto 4piece is way better than those two combined, 30% haste every 2 mins for 20 seconds? 5% haste overall and not rng dependent? what are they thinking? <br />
<br />
Either way, unless they rework FE, we will be wearing 2 t12 till the end of cata, at least</div></div><hr />

2P -- Steady Shot and Cobra Shot generate double the amount of focus. DOUBLE FOCUS... wow :o<br />
4P -- Your Arcane Shot ability has a chance to grant 25% haste to you and your pet for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
Protection, 2P -- Your Judgement ability now also grants a physical absorb shield equal to 30% of the damage it dealt. May wanna spec into judgement damage talent now, are we? ;)<br />
<br />
Protection, 4P -- Reduces the cooldown of Divine Guardian by 60 sec and increases the radius of its effect by 70 yards.<br />
Retribution, 2P -- Your Judgement ability has a 50% chance to generate 1 Holy Power. More RNG? but nice anyway<br />
Retribution, 4P -- While Zealotry is active your abilities deal 12% more damage.<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Elemental, 2P -- Elemental Mastery also grants you 400 mastery rating 15 sec.<br />
Elemental, 4P -- Each time Elemental Overload triggers, you gain 200 haste rating for 4 sec, stacking up to 3 times. LOOOOOOVE this new elemental - that's over 9% spell haste if you can keep it stacked!! - should be easy! <br />
<br />
Restoration, 2P -- After using Mana Tide Totem, the cost of your healing spells are reduced by 25% for 15 sec.<br />
Restoration, 4P -- Increases the duration of Spiritwalker's Grace by 5 sec, and you gain 30% haste while Spiritwalker's grace is active. That's like a trinket with 2 min CD and 20 sec duration - flat out 5% haste overall<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
Protection, 2P -- Your Revenge ability now also grants a physical absorption shield equal to 20% of the damage done by Revenge. Kinda like pala, but nice!<br />
Protection, 4P -- Your Shield Wall ability now grants 50% of its effect to all party and raid members. This is awesome!!!Just my thoughts ;)</div></div><hr />
