Major glyph spot. And If you had looked at the actual changes, you'd see that Juggernaut is getting reduced to 25% crit chance instead of 100%. : /</div></div><hr />

Warriors in Arena<br />
Warriors have plate, shields and Defensive Stance and virtually no active defenses. I think warriors are doing better because DKs are more balanced now and because warriors got Juggernaut. If we nerfed Juggernaut into the ground (which we aren't going to do), then I think you'd see warriors collapse again. Maybe.

I dont mind dropping totems. At least we don't have to put up and keep track of all kinds of buffs like priests and paladins. Just make macros for your totem drops it takes like 2 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol? Why 50%? I think you missed the Empowered Imp changes for Destro in Beta. Used to be your Imp would give you a guaranteed crit. They reduced it from +100% to +20%.<br />
<br />
However, it still gives you a lot of crit. Why did they have to reduce it by so much? BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE 40% CRIT.<br />
<br />
If it was +50%, you would have like an 80% chance to crit with MS, that's barely different from 100%. +25% is much more reasonable, 55-65% chance to crit.<br />
<br />

Anyone that seriously complains about TWO SECONDS on charge is retarded. 12-&gt;14 second cooldown is barely noticeable.<br />

There are those of us that do not have time to run to the other side of the United States(or the world, for others) just for a pet.

If they make this pet available to BlizzCon attendees and those that purchase the DirecTV/Internet video feeds, then that would be more acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about 55% chance to crit before Resilience kicks in. In the end it will end up as a &lt;50% crit chance on about any target with resilience.<br />
<br />
Stop pulling numbers out your ass. 40% is with PVE gear or if you are dumb enough to gem for only crit in PVP gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DeManiac</div><div class="date">2009-05-11, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, it's not the actual guaranteed critt that's the issue, it's the fact that we could ripp through a priest shield or mage shield instantly, thus granting uss some rage.<br />
<br />
The guaranteed critt from Mortal Strike alowed uss to get rage directly after reaching a target that usualy can ignore uss.<br />
<br />
What did a warrior do before? Often charge, then hamstring, what does a warrior do atm, charge then mortal strike, c the diffrence? the diffrence is that our dmg was applyed directly and we were able to ripp through a shield, now with this change, we will some times be able to, but probably people won't use Mortal Strike instantly and instead use hamstring once again.<br />
What change will this give, we will be rage starved, once again.<br />
<br />
Untill blizzard fix the issue with absorbed damage not granting rage, this issue will be there, hunting them all the time, as soon as they give a warrior an ability to ripp through a shield, we will be &quot;OP&quot;, and if they take it away, we are &quot;piss poor&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can't get how it can be that hard to work out a way to give uss rage through shields, they even state the amount of damage absorbed in the combat logg, if that's possible, then can't they use that dmg to calculate it?.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because once they do this, warriors will have to be adjusted once again. And then this Guaranteed critt woulden't mater that much, DK's can do 8k scruge strikes once every 5 sec if they want to or two times every 10 sec, granting them a higher burst, sure, they don't have the Mortal Strike debuff, neither do they have the Overpower debuff, does this change the fact that their burst is alot higher then a warriors, combine it with a class that can give that debuff and it's better? Hunter anyone? Rogue?.<br />
<br />
Now I'm ofc talking about 3v3, since a rogue and dk or a hunter and dk wouldn't do that great together, and that's why a warrior suddenly became so strong in 2v2 especialy.<br />
<br />
We could for once, get rage when hitting our target, since we ripped through their shield in the first second, and our white hit granted uss rage directly after.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now with only a 25% extra chance to critt MS/Slam, we will once again hit the &quot;no rage through absorb shields&quot; issue that we had before, a ms that doesn't critt does like 1400-2300 dmg. a critt does 2.2 times that dmg, and also it apply trauma and deep wounds, and a 4% dmg bonus since it does deep wounds.<br />
<br />
that would be. 2.7 times the dmg, only from that critt, that's how big diffrence the critt vs non critt is.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that the diffrence will be like day and night, but what I'm trying to imply is the change it will be, a warrior won't get rage when hitting a shield, like season 3 and 4. It worked out in these 2 seasons, simply because a warrior had the survivability to alow his druid friend to go hide for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
With the current burst available, destro lock anyone? and some DK speccs, this ain't possible in the same extension, being able to ignore a warrior will make uss fall like a stone again. So yes, I think this change is major, more then people anticipate.<br />
<br />
And no, the dmg of the Mortal Strike or the debuff it gives is not the issue, it's the fact that warrior usualy don't get rage when hitting you, but now they do.</div></div><hr />

Now here's hoping that DKs, Rets, and Rogues get hit by the same bat sooner rather than later.<br />
<br />
<br />
But Priests are fine, amirite?<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, even if they nerfed DKs, Rets and Rogues, you'd probably still be bad at PvP. I guess then you'd demand buffs for Priests!<br />
<br />
Y'know when Ghostcrawler refers to uninformed and whiny forum posters that only care about their own play experience...well, he's talking about people like you kiddo!<br />
<br />
Incidentally...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can tank Ret paladins and DK's with water shield on myself.<br />

Perhaps you should PM this guy and ask him for some tips on PvP. Methinks he isn't bad like you.<br />

Well if it happens to be Blizzcon pet, it won't be that hard to obtain. Blizzcon will offer the in-game item with purchase of the Direct tV event as well as the internet stream for people who don't have/want Direct tv. So $39.95 gets you it :P<br />

Last paragraph for internet stream info. $39.95 is same price as the package deal.<br />

<br />
Both roundhouse kicked warrior ass in duels before this nerf..<br />
<br />
What about frost mages ? oh yes they did too ? what about rogues oh wait 15 sec disarm thats right dead too..<br />
<br />
what about DKs hmm instant loose<br />
<br />
What about Paladins ? loose <br />
<br />
hunters warlocks are pretty much what we could take 1v1 with the 100% juggernaut...<br />
<br />
What all you people are whining about is the 75% healing reduction and you forget we still have that.. Its the dmg that is getting nerfed..<br />
<br />
Oh and what prohibits us from still charging critting for the same dmg ? nothing.. It just gets more random.. More the way Blizzard didnt want warriors to be.. No control if you crit yaay then you have rage for a hamstring if you dont awww you have to run around auto attacking till you have the rage..<br />
<br />
GG all you people out there who loose to warriors and fail to realise that the only UP aspect is the healing reduction which we ARENT loosing.. And the only pure controlled dmg form we have just got removed. Which puts me back to to square one.. Think ill start lvling another DK more dmg more survivability oh and they ALSO get 100% crit on an attack in frost thats just MAGIC dmg instead of physical dmg..<br />
<br />
<br />
Im so glad its not you retards who are running blizzard.. fucking kindergarden show.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axisofjustice</div><div class="date">2009-05-11, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MS was an auto-crit after a charge to make up for the fact that we have to hamstring and rend a target in that order immediately after a charge; and that is 2 global cooldowns of the warrior doing no damage at all. Hell, most classes can destroy you in the first 2 globals, where a warrior have to spend his first two globals that doesn't do any damage if he wants to be effective in pvp. The MS crit was design to make up for that lack of initial burst.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if they took hamstring off the global cooldown and make it only applicable to one single target at a time. Hamstring atm is the worst snare in the game (Chain of Ice is much better in peeling melee dps off your healer, and crippling poison is a passive ability) and against most classes it only lasts around 8 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People kept bitching about 75% healing reduction.Well it's really random to get a 75% healing debuff because Overpower is a total RNG.You have to save your proc and wait for the healer to cast.But doing that you waste a good burst attack that crits for 3-4 k on cloth.<br />
<br />
Btw Blizzard really needs to fix all the bugs with Bladestorm.To Pewpew: Deathknights CAN death grip you while you are using Bladestorm.I have expirienced so many bugs with this ability,like getting frosted in one place while spinning or getting snared while im spinning which is a total bug.<br />
<br />
And for the finisher,Blizzard have said that they will NEVER change the core ability of Juggernaut.That means idiots better adapt to warriors being able to charge every 15 seconds or get used to being pwned by warriors.</div></div><hr />

Warriors have plate, shields and Defensive Stance and virtually no active defenses. I think warriors are doing better because DKs are more balanced now and because warriors got Juggernaut. If we nerfed Juggernaut into the ground (which we aren't going to do), then I think you'd see warriors collapse again. Maybe.

<br />
Arms<br />
Juggernaut (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=64976) now gives your next Slam or Mortal Strike has an additional 25% chance to critically hit if used within 10 sec. (Down from 100% chance)<br />
Glyphs<br />
Glyph of Rapid Charge (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58355) now reduces the cooldown of your Charge ability by 7%. (Down from 20%)<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler says whut.<br />
<br />
Also I do hope warriors don't cry about this, because honestly, after playing a warrior for this long you should be used to the nerfs by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, win for blizzard, they have said they will give us rage when hitting shields in a future, they also said they would like to make rend better before tbc, and it happend in wotlk, so I'm guessing we might c this in expansion nr 5 or something, World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Community.<br />
<br />
But once they do warrior will recive another 10+ nerfs since we are designed in pve to have rage, and thus we do compedetive dps there, in pvp, we suffer from that problem and thus we have less dmg then any other pvp specc, but we also have better and more moves then most other aswel, intervene, disarm, 2x shouts, 75% possible heal debuff, etc etc. we got so much, we just ain't able to use it since we lose nearly all rage when switching stance, and we don't get any rage when hitting people.<br />
<br />
So, I expect like 10 more nerfs already in 3 or 4 years when they launch their 5th expansion.</div></div><hr />

The critt did that we could brake shields more often, cause RAGE starv is a big problem.. And they also made the glyph more or less useless? Imp rend is much better now(IMO&lt;--). Warriors are always nerfed when people see abit challange of taking a warrior. Before 3.1 it was 0 warriors on top 20 teams (in the tournement realms) on EU. 1 on US I think. Now warriors are almost at the same place. And my other question, why do they do ti when they clearly say we won`t remove it or nerf it badly. And they even admit it might make warriors collaps.. AGAIN! <br />
Well this is maybe the thing that gets me 100% focused on rerolling a rogue, just for more fun and better a class that I can have a chance to counter other classes and players without getting starved or kited to death or something(And by this I don`t refer to all the classes that can`t do that.

The good thing is that as long as bad players keep QQing about Ret, every time blizzard does nerf (no reason for it now imo), I can bash &quot;RetHeads&quot; easier and easier with my Warrior.<br />
<br />
People who complain about Rets are the same bad players who can't accept Warriors back in pvp this season and can't adapt to Juggernaut, not matter if it gives 100, 50, 25 or 0%, it's the ability to charge (ok, for some classes, loose their shield and give warrior rage to work on &quot;omg! you're hurting me!?

Nerf to ability: expected. Nerf to glyph: not expected. Not worth it's spot as Major anymore.<br />

Achieving almost complete lockdown on a healer is absurd. And Blizzard never said they wouldn't nerf it, they only said they wouldn't nerf it into the ground, stop misquoting them for phony outrage.</div></div><hr />

That pet is amazing and it is crap that something so cool would be limited to those who live in California, can leave work for a week to drive there, or have $1000 to drop on ebay. Hopefully it is included in the SC2 limited edition box whenever that is released.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can actually get it thru direct tv or online for this next blizzcon. Last year they did it for Direct tv. This year its direct tv and internet. You do have to buy a script for it, but 40 bucks is a lot better then 300 0n ebay.</div></div><hr />

And i feel bad for warriors, its never fun to get nerfed but it was abit op.<br />
The key funktion is still there, right?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dost</div><div class="date">2009-05-12, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could we get a little more QQ here please. Really, is this all forums have gone to - *class a* is way to OP, OMG they nerfed me AGAIN! Obviously people who play a class that has an ability they enjoy is going to be unhappy when it gets nerfed. QQ some more over it, that will certainly change it back. Every class has its +'s and its -'s. Play with what you have or reroll to something with the &quot;+'s&quot; that you like. You lost 75% crit chance on ONE ability, and a couple of secs CD on another, OMG its the end of warriors!! I play a mage, I do NOT like the changes that have, or have not been implemented for mages..however I don't QQ in forums about it. I adjust and keep pumping out the dps with what I have been given.<br />
You're a mage, you don't need to QQ yourself. All the Mage QQ has accumulated to cover you and every other Mage who doesn't complain on the forums normally.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danavos</div><div class="date">2009-05-12, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is blizzard Nerfing Juggernaut? Nothing was really wrong with it. judging by how long juggernaut lasted it seems like people were just QQing bout it cause fury is shit now.Coming from a warrior Arms was fine and a lot more fun to play than Fury and the Juggernaut buff made it worth playing because the spec wasn't a P.O.S. anymore.I play on a high pop server and I don't see anyone complaining about Arms warriors.<br />
Nerfing it because it has a 100% chance isn't a good reason at all look at rogues they have Cold Blood.What is wrong with Arms warriors have 100% chance to crit? Nothing if you ask someone who plays a warrior and plays on a high pop server where complaining about OP things comes by a lot and Juggernaut isn't one of them.<br />
I am not going to play my warrior because Fury is garbage and Arms isn't worth playing now... thanks a lot Blizzard why not just take out Juggernaut because it isn't worth getting now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bossu</div><div class="date">2009-05-12, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">man i have the same problem on my warr,i see nerf after nerf on dps build because some clothie or some noobs qq every time they see some 1 can actually defeat them,the problem is that blizzard listen to them every time and we get nerf every time because off some chilld.Now what spec should i use only protection,or you will nerf this spec to soon because we can tank,oh come on guys stop this things and do somthing good(think for you and don't let any child change every time the warriors talents pls).and btw arms warriors don't have threat reduce like furry warriors in pve so that's another problem blizzard didn't saw it because they are to busy listen to other classes who are now angry that even a warrior can kill them now inb pvp,somthing new for them and they don't like this.I can explect that they will remove completly warrior is some coming pach because we exist in wow and we can kill some mobs.GL leveling other class:D</div></div><hr />

Why nerf the fucking ability? It's not like we were critting 10k MS or Slams and I heard practically no QQ on it so what the fuck blizzard....cool pet too; when is blizzcon?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Overweight</div><div class="date">2009-05-12, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surprised nobody has commented on the Wintergrasp change yet... It kinda sucks honestly, it was one of the only reasons i actually went to WG in the first place as it was easy honor and some 40 easy gold... generally the furious stuff is better than the new WG items anyways. <br />
<br />
@ Warrior changes... well, dunno if it was deserved, but warriors hit HARD. now you just hit slightly less hard.... also, you should have tried arenas as a paladin from S1-S4.... (and yes, I'm ret, and yes I've been playing the spec since 2.0) <br />
<br />
@ Murloc Pet... I'll probably order the PPV just for the pet... hopefully they can do it with a paid steam for you EU guys.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doome</div><div class="date">2009-05-12, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All what i've seen is PVP coments mainly, yet i play as PVE, an some times i do some PVP.<br />
From the PVP point of view yes, we got nerfed once again, from the PVE point of view... we got nerfed again... For some reason Warriors are always nerfed, or they just give poisoned gift like Patch 3.0.9... wich they (blizz devs or shall i say defs) took on 3.1, and again on 3.1.2.<br />
<br />
Slowly they are killing Warr... the warr population on my server is almost reduced to 20 or 30, i believe that around all realms same thing is happening... and blizz allows, so what is the point of leveling a warr today? what is the point of trying to go into Ulduar in a pug or with ur guild, if they say, &quot;... sry mate u don't have enough dps...&quot; for me is a pain... cos im not T7.5 geared, and i'll never be, after 3.1 release! warr's are NOT ALLOWED to PVE anymore!!! Does blizz know this? ofc..<br />
<br />
They just trowed us a candy with juggernaut, and again they took it back, fury is no longer viable... arms is again viable in pvp and in pve... but soon, they'll nerf arms, in order to no longer be a viable spec for pve. Much of what is happening is on jerks like Ghostcrawler (from wowinsider) that have defined that warr are tanks! up yours GC, u just deserv the gold medal for being a jerk!<br />
<br />
To all the other class they complain about warr being OP... learn how to play! u can do as much or more than warr's... just learn how to play, but ofc its easier to say that warr's are OP. <br />
<br />
Did anyone ever thinked what means warrior?<br />
<br />
Thanks GC, thanks blizz defs, i'll will continue to play until u just kill my char or u just erase/delete it... but please, if u do so, dont give me any crapy DK! ur precious creation! give my stats back and remove the penalties.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmays</div><div class="date">2009-05-14, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as the world turns fury is gone, prot warriors can't tank multiple targets. unless they are computer geeks at writting macros. why not just delete the class instead of nerfing and if you think they are over powered show me the one you basing it on.... cause no one else see it not in my guild. It has gotten so bad we can not keep tanks anymore people are deleting toons or not playin them anymore. <br />
<br />
it is sad when i get out dps by some one not even geared for heroics <br />
<br />
I am losing intrested in playin and in this econmy death to a luxury like this one comes easy</div></div><hr />
