Charms and repetition of content<br />
No, All we want is: Remove dailys. Give us tabards to get rep Gain 2 charms every bg/instance u do. Playing a game is for fun. So you forget rl and enjoy the game with friends. Unfortunately some ppl see it as full time job.<br />
So, basically, you want to go back to the Cataclysm model (where dungeons are the source of rewards for several avenues). The very same model the developers have said several times they would like to move away from. <br />
<br />
And on top of that, you want to get rid of a feature of the game... just because. <br />
You don't really seem to take into consideration that there's people that actually enjoy running dailies and they'd rather not have to do dungeons ad nauseam (there're players that feel the opposite, as well, as this thread proved).<br />
<br />
Also, there're other methods to increase certain reputations if you truly don't want to do dailies (Golden Lotus, Klaxxi, Tillers (for individual friendships), Nat Pagle (of the Anglers) and Order of the Cloud Serpent).<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day, it feels like some of these posts have an underlying message: &quot;I only want to do dungeons/raids (but not LFR)&quot;. And, just as we've said in the past to PVP players that the developers want them to also experience the PVE part of the game, this should probably be said for those players as well: there's all this content outside dungeons/raiding available to you, that you can do if you so wish to. But, if you're willingly chosing not to take part on *that* content, is it truly fair to ask for everyone else to be forced to do the kind of content you personally enjoy?<br />
<br />
That is exactly what I am saying, I wish to go dungeons, raids. You say more content is available out side of these. Where?<br />
<br />
Scenario - no healer is need.<br />
Daily Quests - impossible as healer.<br />
<br />
Tell me how you wish me to play your game please?<br />
You have two talent specializations. Why not have one for DPS? Even if it's a different healing spec, do you really need it at every single moment of the day? It's your choice to go with two healing specs, and that obviously comes with a downside (just as a tank that decides to go with two different tanking specs and argues his DPS is low on that content). <br />
<br />
Proceeding to argue that because you run with a dual healing spec there's no content you can do is not going to get you very far because the answer is simple: use a DPS spec for that content.<br />
<br />
No offense meant, but that is quite a arrogant solution. What if said person does not enjoy dpsing? So they are forced to make a dpsspec to do the content? Thats smells more like bad design.<br />
If you are arguing that it's bad design that you're expected to do damage to defeat your foes (which is what you do on daily quests and scenarios) then I have the feeling we're just disagreeing on a fundamental level: what makes this game an (MMO)RPG. <br />
<br />
You can't heal your foes to death (at least not yet), so if you don't want to DPS but want to do dailies, nothing short of divine intervention will help you solve your case. It really sounds like we just disagree on the most fundamental level: how the game should be played on its most basic level. <br />
<br />
The real question here is - If endgame daily content is only beeing created for 1 role of 3 in the game... what effect does it have on the overall role balance in the game? Are there too many tanks in LFD ? Are there lines of Healers waiting in LFR ? No... and you wonder why?- When the endgame every day grind content is focused for DPS?<br />
Has there ever been daily quests that didn't involve damaging something? (Yes, there's always been quests that require you to gather items, which is still the case). You're trying to relate queue times to daily quest design, but you can't really compare apples to oranges. Some players might not change their spec to do their dailies, but some will actually use their dps off-spec to go through them quicker. <br />
<br />
In a world of Dual Talent Specs, NPCs giving you green quality gear to start your off-spec, there's not much reason to say you can't do that content other than *actively* refusing to use the tools at your disposal to make the most out of the game. <br />
<br />
Forcing them to go spend time per week doing totally and utterly meaningless daily content in sub par dps gear is just a disgrace.<br />
If it's &quot;utterly meaningless content&quot;... then why bother doing it? Other than the charms, you're not losing anything from not doing that content (you'll gear up slower since you won't be raising your reputations either, but regardless, you'll gear up eventually).<br />
<br />
But that does not solve the big issue of the game. The big issue right now is that MOP is very unfriendly to alts and just mean and unfair to multirole characters. That needs to be fixed asap.<br />
While it's probably fair to say that Mists is unfriendly to alts (which is something the developers have tried to ease with the Grand Commendations for Mists reputations, for example); to go and say that is unfair to &quot;multirole characters&quot; when you're screaming at the same time that you're refusing to use the other roles of your character is sheer contradiction.<br />
<br />
In the last patch they reduced it from 20 to 5. So now it's even easier to hand them in and get extra rep<br />
Yes. As of 5.1, the repeteable quest for The Klaxxi (Seeds of Fear) now only requires 5 Dread Amber Shards<br />
<br />
1) Scenarios - there was no reason to exclude healers from this content, the content can have scaled dependant on the party make up. A tank joins? Then the mobs do need a tank. A healer joins? Then less mobs exist, though they do hit hard enough for a healer to be needed (so in effect the scenario is of the same length time wise, though every one still has a role to play).<br />
You can enter a scenario and heal if that's what you want. Same deal with a tank. It's just not required to complete them, but the game is not going to penalize your group for it. (If anything, both cases might allow more reckless play from the two DPS). <br />
<br />
2) Daily Quests - I am not the only healer in WoW so place healing daily quests in the game.<br />
So, what about the classes that don't have a healing spec? They should be excluded from them because they chose the wrong class? While not all classes can heal (or tank), all of them can DPS.

Auction House Purchase Orders<br />
Personally I must say I kind of like this idea, not sure if it would be that easy to implement tough.<br />
Could be something like a simple WTB AH tab, and I supposed a timer would need to be associated with the purchase order as well.<br />
<br />
But to be honest I think we would see some sort of reversed undercutting between buyers. <br />
<br />
Let’s imagine for example:<br />
<br />
Player A: Wants to buy 10 Fight Club (http://www.wowdb.com/items/7736-fight-club) at 1337 gold each.<br />
Player B: Sees Player A’s offer and decides he wants to buy 10 Fight Club (http://www.wowdb.com/items/7736-fight-club) at 1338 each.<br />
Player C: See’s all the available options and sells to the “highest bidder” = Player B.<br />
<br />
I would still have a few concerns though, this would probably bring excessive complexity to the AH, because for example, if you are a seller, you are probably going to end up doing some extra work, not only you will have to check the current AH prices from other sellers (competitors), but you would also check the buyers offers against one another and against the current sellers prices in order to find the option that would benefit you the most.<br />
<br />
Buyers would see a similar competition to sellers when they face constant undercutting. This would probably create a certain frustration because when you are a buyer, chances are you need those items more urgently than when you are a seller, since sellers only get gold.<br />
So the sense of urgency from buyers would probably work against the success of this implementation.<br />
<br />
Still I think this is a good idea and I’m probably exaggerating a bit when I speculate about the possible consequences. We just need to make sure that ideas are sound before we spend resources on them, we need to be sure that not only they would work, but that enough players would actually benefit and experience better gameplay because of it. <br />
<br />
I’ll share the suggestion with the devs, but I suspect this isn’t something new to them, we’ll see. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248829-isnt-it-about-time-for-purchase-orders-on-the-ah/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6160437494?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Justice Points Rewards<br />
Why is it that lvl 85s can earn more JP per hour than a 90 can? The 85 heroics still grant excellent rewards when doing them as 85s. Isn't this somewhat wrong? Should not increasing your level give you an advantage rather than a disadvantage?<br />
Looking at the gear you can get for Justice Points, and knowing that people can hop into heroics at level 90 which rewards better gear than JPs are exchanged for, it makes sense that you don't get or need heaps of JPs once you're level 90.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we've acknowledged that parts of the JP system wasn't ideal at the start of MoP. The JP gear would be more useful pre-90, while some people at level cap have mentioned they were sometimes finding JPs stacking up with nothing to spend them on. We'll make tweaks along the way to improve things as needed, based on feedback and monitoring of course. Converting excess VP to JP in 5.2 for those of you who need the points is a nice start.

<br />
Yes, the nerfed Normal Elegon. What's the big deal?<br />
<br />
Anyone who is past him, this does not affect.<br />
<br />
Anyone who is stuck on him, almost 3 months after his release, this will benefit. Yes, there are still people stuck on him. Not everyone is as awesome at this game as the MMO-C community is, where everyone is in 6/6H 6/6H 3/4H guilds.<br />
<br />
Not trying to sound nasty, but to assume people aren't stuck on a boss because you aren't is kind of selfish.<br />
<br />
Stone Guard: 34643 (97.55%)<br />
Four Kings: 30294 (85.30%)<br />
<br />
Elegon: 20791 (58.54%)<br />
Will of the Emperor: 19068 (53.69%)<br />
<br />
87% of guilds that have killed Stone Guard have gotten to Elegon.<br />
<br />
Only 69% of guilds that have gotten to Elegon have killed him.<br />
<br />
Elegon 10 man normal statistics: Kills: 11.0% Wipes: 89.0% ; 60576 kills, 488807 wipes, 11.0 % success.<br />
Elegon 10 man Heroic statistics: Kills: 11.1% Wipes: 88.9% ; 11561 kills, 92680 wipes, 11.1 % success.<br />
<br />
Elegon 25 man normal statistics: Kills: 14.5% Wipes: 85.5% ; 9583 kills, 56320 wipes, 14.5 % success.<br />
Elegon 25 man Heroic statistics: Kills: 9.4% Wipes: 90.6% ; 4433 kills, 42661 wipes, 9.4 % success<br />
<br />
The identical success / wipe ratio for 10 man likely also played a hand in the nerf.<br />
<br />
Spirit Kings 10 man success ratios are 27.4% for normal, and dropping to 7.3% for Heroic<br />
Will of the Emperor 10 man success ratios are 32.7%, for normal, and dropping to 6.2% for Heroic<br />
<br />
Normal to Heroic ratios average about 4-5x higher for normal than heroic. Based on the nature of Elegon's mechanics being a step-up in comparison to mostly everything else in MSV, his normal success rate should be somewhere around 30-35%. While that seems high, it would be kept in line when comparing other fights.</div></div><hr />

Actually just reduce the time needed to cap the rep imo. The reason we hate the dalies is because it takes a *little* too long to reach the required rep.<br />

You mean Wrath, don't you? :P It was like the only expansion where I can recall be able to heal people through standing in fire like idiots. Boy was that tough to work out of some people's heads when Cataclysm started. I had people literally standing in stuff getting killed blaming me as a healer because it was impossible for them to move slightly out of the damage's way.<br />
<br />
Oh and remember Occulous? The one where you had to fly on drakes of different colors and use them to beat the boss at the end? I remember it, talk about handing you stuff for barely any effort. Blizz offered a chance at a mount, gems, and extra loot just to get people to actually DO the dungeon. It wasn't really hard to do but god would it take forever to get a tank who wouldn't drop the moment he got que'd for it.</div></div><hr />

All healers still have basic DPS abilities. So like always, you can either do the content at your leisure, or go the extra mile and expedite the process. In this case, it would be by using another talent spec. <br />

You can do dailies<br />
You can buy gear off the AH<br />
You can buy gear off the black market AH<br />

<br />
Im currently in a top guild. I use much time on farming mats for flask, pots etc. I farm VP aswell(1000 vp asap after reset). And these charms &quot;of hell&quot;......<br />
<br />
I have to say, the big majority cant stand to do so much dailies. And we feel it`s like talking to a wall whenever we bring it up for you. There are so many who have adressed their conserns, and it starts to get annoying when you dont seem to get out point at all.<br />
<br />
You are making it harder to raid hardcore now in MOP. We have to use more time, which sometimes wonders me if its worth it. I`ve allways been a top raider, but now I feel I need to step down soon if things doesnt change. Some may like doing all the dailies and stuff, and people does have different ways to look at it. But all the serious raiders &quot;hate&quot; the current situation. We have life beside wow aswell. (ps I raid 20-25 hours a week).<br />
Farming mats for flasks, pots, VP, charms etc. gets me to hate the dailies. And by hate, I mean hate. I still havnt heard one skilled raider who has shared their enjoy of it yet.<br />
<br />
So please blizzard, do something. You know how many who dislike the dailies. Same quests _over and over_ gain. Repet. Meh.... &quot;Kill x amounts of those, gather x amounts of these&quot;...<br />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
I did not make any of the demands the blue poster suggests I did. I just did point out to him (or her) that I choose &quot;Holy Paladin&quot; for a) I only do enjoy to be healer and b) I only do enjoy ranged classes. Of all roles in the game, Melee DPS is the very thing I detest to play *the most*. It is why I did not create one.<br />
<br />
So I just was pointing out that I was not finding these Daily Quests &quot;fun&quot; and felt my options kind of were limited to progress in that type of content.<br />
<br />
I did not seekRep Tabards / Exclusive content for healers only / daily quests to be removed for ALL for &quot;you do not like them&quot;, or any of the other things he wishes to imply that I did.<br />
<br />
What I was saying was .. for a player in my position, MoP kind of is similar to Cataclysm - it is &quot;dungeon&quot; &quot;raid&quot; or &quot;stand at ogrimar&quot;.<br />
<br />
I did suggest more daily quests of Cataclysm Firelands design though. &quot;Throw bears from a tree&quot; &quot;Walk this mob up a hill and destroy a tower - they shall help you&quot; &quot;pick rocks up from the ground&quot; &quot;Kill mobs at satheria roost, these NPC's shall help&quot; &quot;run around a cave and click runes&quot; - for these type of quests did seem more accessible to all 3 roles than the MoP daily quests wich seem to be designed only with DPS classes in mind.<br />
<br />
Though I do have my reply. &quot;Make DPS&quot; *shrugs*.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like the way a game is designed, then go play another game, or design your own game. There are plenty of other MMO out there that have a different grind, maybe they should get to 125 dungeoneering in runescape instead. <br />
<br />
I love dailies, the only issue was that there were too many to begin with at the start of MoP, so instead of whining like a baby I split them in half. After getting exalted with 1 faction, I moved on to the next one, and so on. I didn't do all dailies every day but I still got exalted with them all waaay before 5.1 came out and I collected over 1000 coins. My alts aren't important to me, they don't raid, so they don't need rep at all, and if I did want to get them rep, I'd get as far as revered (10 days or so) because they already have exalted rewards from my main (account bound mounts) <br />
<br />
For those people who raid on more than one character, do they realise that they need to spend the same time on one toon as they do on another to have them both perform as well as each other? If they spend 20 hours on their main raiding toon and only 5 hours on their second raiding toon, doesn't it make sense that the second raiding toon won't perform as well as the first? If they expect that they need to spend less time on their secondary toons to perform just as well, they are delirious and really need to reconsider the reason they raid on more than one toon</div></div><hr />

Didn't you get the memo? Every person is in a hardcore slave driving 55 hour a week bleeding edge progression guild where if they don't have every upgrade in the game by the fourth week they end up in a river with concrete shoes. I wonder what that person did when he used his charms and got gold 90% of the time other than probably throw a fit like a child. <br />
<br />
I can understand the argument if the coin was a GUARANTEE of loot. It's not. It's not even close to a guarantee and it never will be. This entire &quot;it's mandatory&quot; is absolute crap and a joke. Nothing in this game is mandatory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have absolutely no problems getting flasks, pots, Valor points, charms, food, whatever. Here's the secret.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the guild pitches in. One person farms Tiger Meat for raid feasts. Two people farm Danio for 20 minutes before raid time. One to two people farm herbs. The end result of this is: Everyone has food. Will always have food. We have more flasks and golden lotus than we could ever imagine using. We have more stat pots than we could use.<br />

No, the complaint is that so much is tied to rep that you're pretty much forced to do dailies to progress if you don't raid (and to fill in gear gaps if you're raiding). And you obviously need to be DPS to do dailies. I feel it's overall poor design, but hey, what do I know.<br />

Why do people not understand that putting on a tabard and clearing dungeons over and over.. -is the same logistical effort and reasoning- as doing dailies solo and clearing the same quests over and over?<br />
Why don't you understand that all anyone wants is an option to be able to get rep another way than dailies? The option to be able to get rep through dungeons if they choose, since everyone can now choose to farm Valor through dungeons or dailies (which was never possible before). Wasn't MOP supposed to be the expansion with multiple progression paths, where you could advance your character no matter your playstyle?<br />
<br />
So, why are dungeons getting left in the dust?<br />
<br />
Some people like to do quests and dailies. Some prefer dungeons (and the queue time is much faster, plus you have more control over whether it's a good or bad group, if you tank or heal). Both should be viable, and somewhat equal, options. Right now, it's not even close. Dailies are a far better use of your time. I think that's wrong.</div></div><hr />

If you're both antisocial and stubborn then I have no idea what to tell you other than your problems go deeper than dailies.<br />
<br />
People need to get over the idea that Blizz is ever going to go &quot;oh yeah you were completely right and we were wrong..you being able to live in dungeons to grind rep is obviously the right thing to do we're sorry please keep giving us money&quot;. Spending a weekend grinding heroics with tabards to max all your reps is not a progression path. Tabards are not coming back (at least as they were in Cata). Get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dailies suck. In cataclysm we were forced to do dungeons for most of reputation grinding, and they were a freaking pain with pugs, frustratingly so. Now that dungeons are actually somewhat fun in MOP, there's almost no incentive to run them. And leveling alts is a pain cause there's only four freaking dungeons 85-90. I've gone from logging in everyday to logging in every couple of days now, now the guild raids are on a break till after new year and franky I see myself quitting soon. ps: I'm not doing any more FREAKING dailies.<br />
<br />
edit: People are actually defending blizzard's BS posts about dailies, maybe the world did end and I'm in hell where warcraft players are even dumber than before... Jesus... We just want the option to get that rep with a tabard, it's not &quot;the end of the world&quot; asking for it, ffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is nothing stopping you from NOT doing dailies. If you feel like you have to, it's YOUR OWN fault. I occasionally take a break from doing dailies. It's not like the whole world is going to end. It's YOUR OWN fault for feeling the urge and need to gear up fast. The funny thing is... once they've cleared everything in such a short time, they're complaining there's nothing to do.

If ppl say that it isn't mandatory, I might aswell reforge my gear totally wrong on purpose, it's the same thing with not doing dailies. <br />

I've never stopped playing WoW because of anything going ingame, until these dailies. That tells alot. Blizzard needs to wake the f up<br />

oh poor you, lil PVE hero has to do some actual work to get some extra loot try being a frost dk in pvp or anything in PVP its alot harder fighting real people than AI controlled mobs which get easier and easier every week and as you stopped playing wow get off this site as its a wow based fansite</div></div><hr />

Tell me again how we now have fewer options.<br />
<br />
<br />
You miss the point.<br />
<br />
The blue says the devs think you should do what they want. And MoP released and currently still has, only dailies for rep.<br />
If they had added rep into dailies, scenarios, instances, pvp even, turnins, grinds...then fine, because its player choice what to do. But that bliz post says you should play how the devs want you to, which is so amazinly backwards in terms of game design its silly. You dont tell the players how to play an MMO, you give them options and let them get on with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer me this:<br />
If bliz put in tabbards and I spent my time doing nothing but hc's, how would that harm anyone? (assuming there is a daily rep cap so I dont get rep faster than people doing dailies).<br />
<br />
<br />
The answer is: There is no harm.<br />
The only arguement Bliz has is that the devs want you to play their content. And when a company starts designing for the developers ego rather than the player enjoyment, you can tell its all gone to hell.<br />
<br />
If I was a dev and I realised all the players were doing one activity over another, know what I'd do? I'd do more of the popular activity, rather than have a hissy fit and try to force players into content they obviously dont enjoy. I would not remove dailies, I would leave them for those that enjoy them, but I woudl not remove the other methods jsut becuase it hurts my fragile ego that an awful lot of people think the daily quests I designed are boring and really badly set out.</div></div><hr />

Since the Commendations that were added in 5.1 it only takes a few days to reach exalted, heck it can take 3 days to hit exalted with Cloud Serpents and 4 days to hit exalted with Tillers.

Peeps are used to the higher Cata-Tiers where you got &quot;phat purplz&quot; for Justice points. They don't remember that in the beginning of Cata, every non raiding alt was basically locked in blues with a few crafting / rep epics.

<br />
I can completely go at my own pace. No waiting for others<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
Equip Tabard. Queue for dungeon. Wait 35 minutes. Hopefully it's not a bad group. Kill trash. Kill 3-5 bosses. Good group, only took 20 minutes<br />
Queue for dungeon. Wait 40 minutes. Got a bad group. This dungeon takes about 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
1 Hour 35 minutes later, I've killed the same old trash, and the same old bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh man, that was so much better.<br />
<br />
Why do people not understand that putting on a tabard and clearing dungeons over and over.. -is the same logistical effort and reasoning- as doing dailies solo and clearing the same quests over and over?<br />
<br />
It's the same exact god damn thing!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not trying to nitpick here, but I'm calling B.S. on this. Please define, &quot;top guild&quot;<br />
<br />
Because I'm no where near in a &quot;top guild&quot; anymore. We were US 200ish back in Cata, but had a slow start due to a few issues we had in October and early November. We're back up to around US 600, and we're 4/6H-6/6-4/4 . Clearly not a &quot;top&quot; guild. That being said,<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no problems getting flasks, pots, Valor points, charms, food, whatever. Here's the secret.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the guild pitches in. One person farms Tiger Meat for raid feasts. Two people farm Danio for 20 minutes before raid time. One to two people farm herbs. The end result of this is: Everyone has food. Will always have food. We have more flasks and golden lotus than we could ever imagine using. We have more stat pots than we could use.<br />
<br />
Stop treating this like a single player MMO and make your &quot;top guild&quot; chip in and get shit done the right way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoted for Truth.<br />
<br />
I remember when dailies only gave you a minimal amount of gold, yet people still had the incentive to do them. Now they give you a chance at FREE GEAR that is relevant to the raid tier, but that's just asking too much.<br />
<br />
Summary: People did dailies when they didn't reward anything, didn't complain. People do dailies when the reward something, complain.<br />
<br />
My absolute favorite quote from the MMO-Champion forums was someone saying that &quot;this entire community should be isolated and studied for scientific research.&quot; It's conversations like this thread, and the WoW-Forums, that make me guffaw thinking back at that quote.<br />
<br />
First problem... Top guilds don't use feasts because they provide 275 of a stat, versus 300 stat for using personal food.<br />
Second problem... Just because some players enjoy dailies, doesn't mean that should be the only source of an item that provides raiders with additional gear progression. I love the bonus charms, but we should be able to earn them in more than one way. Whether its scenarios/heroics or BGs/Raids idc, but there needs to be more ways to get these charms, since they're considered required if you are any type of serious raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They NEED the charms on the dailies because they NEED incentive in order to get these dungeon crawlers out in the open.<br />
<br />
Thats why they add charms to pet battles, because these are out there and not instanced.<br />
<br />
This whole discussion is moot, because<br />
a) charms are not mandatory (the chance of actually getting a useful item is extremely low AND we raided for 8 years w/o such a system and we were fine)<br />
b) we need another incentive to go out first before we make them available through &quot;World-of-city-que-craft&quot; content.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the 275 v 300 food: Replace &quot;This person farms Tiger Meat&quot; with &quot;This person farms X&quot;. &quot;Top Guilds&quot; don't have 12-27 people looking out for themselves. It's a collective effort. Pretty simple. <br />
<br />
I was being pretty broad, but I guess we'll play semantics about 25 stats, equivalent to a WOTLK (see: 2008) red gem.<br />
<br />
This notion that &quot;top guilds only use 300&quot; stats is horse shit. There are shit guilds that use 275 stats, and there are shit guilds that use 300 stats.<br />
<br />
There are top 100 guilds that use 275 stats, there are top 100 guilds that use 300 stats. The top 10 have an excuse to only use the 300 stats. Stop kidding yourself that 25 stats matters. If you're berserking on a fight, or having general add problems at and around 1% of a boss, and you're using 275 stats, then yeah, spring yourself for that extra 25 stats. It might make a difference.<br />
<br />
But in a raiding tier where the only Berserk timer that proved a problem was Garajal Heroic Week 1, please don't patronize everyone here by saying &quot;25 stats matters&quot; for this tier.</div></div><hr />

In many dailies (Klaxxi is worst offender), quest drop rates are way below 1%. For 2 people it would take longer than eternity to finish such quests. Oh and if you need to kill 10 mobs, there are only like 4 up at a time only, so if you also need quest drops, it rises up geometrically.<br />
<br />
Problem in that blue post is here:<br />
<br />
If you are arguing that it's bad design that you're expected to do damage to defeat your foes (which is what you do on daily quests and scenarios) then I have the feeling we're just disagreeing on a fundamental level: what makes this game an (MMO)RPG.<br />
On fundamental level, people shouldn't be pushed into solo-activity. Many people chose role of healer or tank, because they like MMO aspect of exploring some dungeons with friends. Noone plays MMO because of dailies. This is moronic to say so.<br />
<br />
And those roles which are fundamental for multiplayer activity in WoW (tanks and healers) are highly neglected in endgame design. They are forced to attempt to kill mobs with absurd amount of HP, because MMO aspect is just not there. They say - &quot;5-men were too rewarding&quot;, but hey dailies is what makes this game MMO? Another proof that some people in WoW development should be replaced and are in their position for too long.</div></div><hr />

Rates would apply of course probly running out after about 7 dungeons (only for the tokens part not the rep) but yeah. Honestly this is a well rounded, (And also &quot;Middle ground&quot; for ALL) and would work well for people that still want to see the daily's from the fact you have to still have to get to exalted with the faction in order to get the tabard that would only really be usefull for alts.

I was the person that the blue aparently thougth I didnt want to dps. This was never about that. I do my dailies in DPS gear and that dps I get from LFR Quing up waiting there for more than hour for each run. <br />
<br />
My logic - something that the blue poster obviously did not care to understand - is that there are healers needed to keep LFRs popping more than 1 per hour. So... My point was to get those healers to help out in LFR and at the same time get lesser charms that way instead of sending them to do ... totally worthless content because a) it is not created for every roles in the game b) it does not add a single thing to the story of the game c)it does not involve any social aspect - other than mob tagging.<br />
<br />
Never in million years did I ever say that I wanted to just heal. I want to have option - and I want to be rewarded for helping ppl out (like in lfr) when There are 1 hour long Qs there) - because that way I know I will not have to wait for an hour as well cause I know there are more ppl like me.<br />
<br />
This is not about lesser charms - and this is not about just healing. This is about an MMO game where 1 aspect of the game affects another. If a healer that is needed to keep LFR Qs going is instead doing dailies - or even worse - quing up in those LFR as DPS to get better daily gear... then LFR Qs become longer and no1 wins. <br />
<br />
Like I said to that ignorant blue. WOW is a game about core balance. WHen a supported feature like LFR has over 1 hour long Qs.... then role balances in the game are not good. THen those roles that are needed should have incentive to help out all those dps players. Never in million years was this about just healing topic - this was about giving ppl options. Thats what BLizzard said they would be doing - but they did not.<br />
<br />
But anyway - My sub ran out on the 22nd. I will not be returning to World Of Queues any time soon. I got better things to do with my spare time. Like actually play a game instead of wait in Qs.</div></div><hr />

If he only likes to play as a healer, why no do the dailies in a group ? I really don´t see his problems, especially since you can finish the dailies much quicker in a group.<br />
<br />
I am &quot;that player&quot; (the un happy healer - not the player who did ask for removal of daily quests and free coins).<br />
<br />
I do not wish to join a group - not for I am &quot;anti social&quot; , and the reasons kind of are tricky to explain and every one seems to mis understand the problem .. though I try to explain xD<br />
<br />
I have at level 90, 5 characters.<br />
<br />
1 Affliction Warlock, 1 Demonology Warlock, 2 BM Hunters, and 1 Holy Paladin.<br />
<br />
I choose all of these for one simple reason - they all are ranged classes. I really do not find Melee fun at all. In fact I detest melee, it just is stressful, it is the exact opposite of fun for me.<br />
<br />
In Dungeons &amp; Raids I only enjoy one role - Healing.<br />
<br />
For Questing (including Daily Quests), I only do enjoy the 4 DPS classes (and *only* because to DPS as the Paladin requires that I play a Melee class - either a ret or prot paladin - and as I say, I do not enjoy melee)<br />
<br />
My 4 DPS will never step foot in a dungeon or a raid, which is NP for I create them *only to quest* (and occasionally I shall solo old content for transmog armor).<br />
<br />
The Holy Paladin issue is more complicated. I do not wish to party for daily quests with others for a couple of reasons :<br />
<br />
1) With exception of raid evenings, I do play *usually* between midnight - 6am (so all my guild friends / friends they are off line).<br />
2) &quot;So what? Approach random players?!&quot; - It is not fun. I can not explain why, it is not &quot;anti social&quot; issue, it is a fun issue - no healer is needed for a DPS char *unless* the DPS char wishes to *pull everything and NUKE!* .. and if they do this, this is great fun! .. for the DPS, it still is boring for me - I am spam healing *one player only*.<br />
<br />
So the situation I am stuck for is .. I have 4 DPS I can go Daily Quests for *hours*, who never shall enter raid or dungeon content, and a Holy Paladin that I *do* wish to enter raid and dungeon content, though can see no fun way to have rep points also.<br />
<br />
What I did suggest in that thread was more &quot;role neutral&quot; daily quests - similar to Firelands - &quot;throw bears from trees&quot; &quot;pick up rocks&quot; &quot;go kill some mobs at satherias roost - take these NPCs they shall help you&quot; &quot;heal injured orcs&quot; .. though my request kind of got lost in accusations of &quot;You just do wish for rep tabards&quot; &quot;free epics&quot; &quot;free rep points&quot; &quot;removal of Daily Quests&quot; &quot;you are **** lazy&quot; &quot;Make DPS&quot; &quot;Quit if you dont like it&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
I do not expect Blizzard to *drop every thing and accommodate my needs* - it seems my needs are unique any way .. as no one quite got the reason for my complaint xD</div></div><hr />

But problem is not about alts. Problem is about reaching it on main char who happened to be tank or healer. As this is MMO, then MMO aspect should have more love. I. e. make 5-men/LFR/raids/other-group-content to be optional way to acquire what dailies give - charms and rep. Thus dailies can remain for people, who aren't currently in mood for grouping, and for dps, who have high dungeon queue times (and tanks/healers attempting to kill daily mobs increase this timer even more), to not waste their time and do rep farm while in queue. I am not sure what GC meant by &quot;what makes this game an (MMO)RPG&quot;, but MMORPG is definitely not about dailies and similar activities (like Brawler's Guild), which are made around only 1 role in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly - Daily quests are even worse than the old tabard system cause there is zero teamwork involved. Its the worst kind of content. Almost every other content in the game is a better option. <br />
<br />
I feel sorry for that blue and his ignorance. Obviously BLizzard is going very defencive about their forced daily questing system. His arguments were childish and just showed how he can not connect dots in a MMO game. Where one aspect of the game will always affect another.</div></div><hr />

WotLK dungeons didn't require much in the way of teamwork. And Mists of Pandaria dungeons CERTAINLY don't. <br />

Farming warbeads didn't require teamwork, farming meat for frostsabers didn't require teamwork... Old dailies didn't require teamwork. <br />

You can group up for dailies. The &quot;less than 1% droprate for klaxxi items&quot; is BS. The so called &quot;never dropping&quot; items like Mush'an toungues actually have a 39% droprate according to a 193,658 sample from Wowhead.<br />
<br />
If you attach rep to nothing but repetitive dungeon running, you might as well not even have a faction to go along with it.</div></div><hr />

The idea that people are claiming &quot;dailies aren't forced on you&quot; is absurd. We all know they are + we also know they are boring as all get out. The reason the dungeons/tabards were frowned upon is because people (like me) had way too much time to play on wow. I still do, but I won't be wasting that time on 2-3 hours of farming the same quests that I have for many weeks. Eventually, had I numbed my mind hard enough to actually convince myself that mashing the same 4 buttons for 2-3 hours a day to &quot;earn&quot; the gear needed to hold a core slot in any respectable raiding guild, then maybe I wouldn't have stepped down from progression raiding.<br />

I have seen 25H content, pushed for realm firsts, farmed mediocre Rbg ratings on 6-8 toons in a season.... What I haven't seen is even ONE logical reason why Activision would believe that forcing it's player fanbase to solo repetitive quests has any correlation to mmo. <br />
<br />
To those that are saying &quot;if you don't like Wow, go play one of the other games just like it&quot;.... Please, for the love of all that is good Tell us what that game is so we can go try it out.</div></div><hr />

The idea that people are claiming &quot;dailies aren't forced on you&quot; is absurd. We all know they are + we also know they are boring as all get out. The reason the dungeons/tabards were frowned upon is because people (like me) had way too much time to play on wow. I still do, but I won't be wasting that time on 2-3 hours of farming the same quests that I have for many weeks. Eventually, had I numbed my mind hard enough to actually convince myself that mashing the same 4 buttons for 2-3 hours a day to &quot;earn&quot; the gear needed to hold a core slot in any respectable raiding guild, then maybe I wouldn't have stepped down from progression raiding.<br />
<br />
Is that different from farming the same mobs over and over again for resist gear? Or how about farming mobs for drops that are the ONLY way to raise rep with a rep? <br />
<br />
If you're dead set on cutting edge progression raiding, you would have started doing said raids in heroic dungeon gear (the gear they were tuned to be doable in,) and would more likely than not have acquired actual raiding gear which, yes, is better than rep gear, and would subsequently have no additional need for them.<br />

If your guild is making you do dailies, find a new guild. <br />
<br />
So actually, the argument that &quot;dailies are required&quot; is the only absurd one around here.</div></div><hr />

You could aoe those TBC mobs for motes with friend, buy from AH or kill on alt. Those drops you were specifically speaking about (Aldor/Scryer) could also be received via running dungeons (group content) and were quite cheap.<br />
<br />
How it is same to looting 12 objects form ground, where only 4-5 up at a time with dozen other people doing same? Or killing same mushans, which have &quot;39% drop rate&quot; as you say, which have half million HP, scattered so can't be really aoe'd, and only few up at a time?<br />
<br />
Tell me where on AH can I buy mushan tongues, shieldwall robot drops or any other quest drops? It isn't even remotely same.<br />
<br />
But as usual, people who are used to play dps, they won't even think that something goes wrong in MoP. Log into WoW, make your dps naked, die, get res sickness, and then go and try kill something! Feel the misery, feel what tanks and healers, who are pushed into those dailies, feel! Then come back and say, hey drop rate is &quot;39% according to wowhead&quot;, and it is so much more fun than dungeons!<br />

Raids don't rain epics. There is a reason why people had to use pvp gear in many slots in same TBC. Lottery system of rewards is broken, and while lottery tickets (charms) and VP gear (which was made to make up for lottery's flaw) don't fix it, not using them is like going naked uphill during heavy snow - sure, can be done, will take time and health, but doesn't mean that everyone would do that.</div></div><hr />

The truth is people love to taste flavour and Warcraft has a very rich flavour, and infact it has many great flavours. Instead homogenizing(lore wise) them they should make sure something special happens when the too flavour colides, sometimes the flavour taste bitter and you want to cry, sometimes the flavour can be spicy and you just want the moment to end. But thats how great stories are told and thats what happens when great figures (or flavours) clash. This might even be true for game play, though I had not had a critical look at it yet.<br />
<br />
Thats just a tip since I found out blizz reads mmo-c. To be fair their getting better, way better than cata.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2012-12-24, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incredibly easy solution, if you hate the dailies and want the game your way, find a game offering that. Unsub today and move on and quit complaining.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the daily system. If you're a &quot;raider&quot; you do what you have to do and stop whining. I raided hardcore Vanilla through Wrath and decided I wanted more time away. Years ago, we were expected to fill our inventory with consumables before coming to raids. I had to roll an alt to farm potions, flask materials, elixirs and not set foot in AQ40 without having about 2 stacks of every relevant trick for my class - today a raiding support character isn't even considered, it's just an alt. And this was when we were expected to be in a raid 7 days a week. Today you gather 90 tokens (many dailies of which offer 2) per week and raid 2-3 days. Are you people serious? You're calling yourself competitive raiders and complaining when you have 4 days off to get this junk done? &quot;Oh but my alts!&quot; is not an excuse, unless you are a World guild that absolutely requires certain classes to be available to them in a pinch you're just throwing out a straw man argument, your alts will probably never be called on.<br />
<br />
The blue was spot on calling people out. The Wrath system was garbage and for some reason they let it persist. Further, a person that refuses to DPS to get their job outside of raiding done (and won't spend the massive amount of gold you make off them to respec back afterwards, you don't even need to reglyph ffs) is not a real gamer and part of the reason this game has gone away from the real MMO genre. That's just another lazy person I'm glad I never had the displeasure of having to work through Ulduar Hardmodes to hit a server first with. My old guild consisted of people who carried stacks of glyphs with them to reglyph mid-raid back when you had to really pay to reglyph. Today, it's brainless to reglyph and all completely situational, I wonder if they complain about that, too?<br />
<br />
In the end, the real difference between a solid progression guild of yesteryear and today is that they are infested with people who cannot be counted on to put in the effort that is presented to them. If you played this card several years ago, you would have been considered a casual wannabe, sat, and probably gkicked sooner or later. Today complaining about being asked to do the little extras results in massive complaints. I'm pretty sure I made the right choice to get away from this, I saw it coming at the intro of Cataclysm when people were expected to play like they knew what they were doing and they complained all the way through it.<br />
<br />
Also, if they remove the daily system and force dungeons on me and my alts for rep, I'm out.</div></div><hr />

It's also very amusing to me that arrogant retarded blue decided to pull out the &quot;MMO&quot; part of mmorpg. Essentially arguing against what he is saying. I agree healers and tanks shouldn't be FORCED to make a dps os and then go grind out a set of dps gear just to go through content.

<br />
I guess they're forgetting that these are a brand new feature to earn a chance at additional loot in conjunction to the loot you already won from regular drops.<br />
<br />
We lived without them for three expacs. You're getting a chance at additional free loot from a boss and you're whining that you have to put in additional time in order to do so? And you call yourself &quot;hardcore&quot; - ie, lording over the lesser peons, putting in long raid hours, doing whatever it takes for an edge, but somehow dailies for free loot are out of the question?<br />
<br />
I bet most of these people are the ones that cried about &quot;casuals getting too much free loot ruining the game&quot;.<br />
<br />
All the top raiders feel the same as me, even Sco and rest of Method, aswell as Vodka. When you have the top 10 guilds also going on and on, is it then time to open our eyes? Is it that difficult to understand why? If your are raiding 20-25+ hours a week(as I do), to stay ahead, and have a life beside. Farming the damn boring dailies over and over and over becomes a pain in the ass. Therefor its more demanding raiding hardcore now, than before. <br />
<br />
Before every raid we have to bring atleast 80x pots, 60x 300stat food, 8 flasks, upgraded gear(VP) before first raid and make sure to have atleat 3 coins. Have you ever farmed for 300stat food? And how many stacks have you had at the most? And do you do this on an alt aswell?<br />
<br />
275 vs 300stat is about 3mill damage extra on a 8min fight, then u have the healing aswell. <br />

If the answer was as simple as grabbing guildies who had to do the exact same thing ANYWAY and use them and accomplish the task faster, yes, I'd rather do dailies than grind dungeons over and over again. <br />

<br />
It doesn't change the fact that the raids can be done in heroic dungeon gear. Therefore, valor gear is not required. Simple. As. That. <br />
<br />
You might as well say that blizzard should put a cap on the time other players are able to play, simply because you or members of your raid team have a job and can't play at some hour of the day, and it's therefore &quot;unfair&quot; that other guilds are able to progress more easily because they're able to put in more time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If your guild doesn't expect you to do everything you can to be competitive, it wasn't a progression raiding guild. Keyword = progression<br />

Then you either do it, or you don't. That players that put in more time can get more reward (or filler rewards, as it were) shouldn't come as a surprise. <br />

<br />
Assuming 17 DPS doing 50,000 DPS (purposely low-balling this number), that equates out to 850,000 raid DPS.<br />
<br />
3 Million extra damage on a boss fight equates to 3 1/2 seconds. Only 1 fight this entire expansion so far has had a DPS check, and it lasted for all of 1-2 weeks.<br />
<br />
I stand by my previous comments in the thread regarding 275 vs 300 stat food. It's definitely a DPS/HPS gain, obviously. There is no disputing that.<br />
<br />
But unless you were working on Heroic Gara'jal week 1 of his availability, or Heroic Sha of Fear, there shouldn't be any reason that people feel the 300 stat food is &quot;mandatory&quot; in the same vein they think dailies are mandatory.<br />
<br />
<br />
All that said, you had a lot of good points expressed in a mature manner, so I definitely appreciate that. And while I agree (somewhat) that there can be a major time investment, we all have to deal with it. There has always been a time investment, and sacrifices have always been made to be cutting edge in this game. Before, it was &quot;How can I be expected to run this many dungeons and farm all my mats for raid?&quot; Now it's just &quot;How can I be expected to run all these dailies and farm all my mats for raid?&quot; Been around too long to see the patterns here.</div></div><hr />

That way the players can choose by doing dailies or dungeons! I would`ve loved that. Raiders like me would have given the chance of farming both charms and VP at the same time. Dailies does not give enough VP.<br />

And that's not Blizzard's intent. If you'd make it 3 charms per run, then yeah, maybe they think it's a good option. A good group can then farm them quick and easy. And the people who like dailies can do dailies (wich in the end will be quickest and more favorable). It's a tough balancing act. Same with reputation with dungeons. I am on Blizzard's standpoint.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froziro</div><div class="date">2012-12-24, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but healers are raging atm. forcing them to do dps spec isn`t they way to go either. So charms in dungeons would help alot.<br />
<br />
And giving the players more options wouldnt be a bad idea. We all play this game because we like it, but when there`s something we dont like, it would be nice to avoid it as much as possible. And believe me, the majority of raiders really dislike the dailies. But we love the rest.<br />

Oh that's just such horseshit. You'd probably cry your little eyes out if you had to do BC raiding considering things were far more scarce and harder to come by than MoP. If you were actually in a hardcore guild, your guild has a shit ton of money and will be buying the necessary materials for raiding.<br />
<br />
Too bad you're just talking out of your ass much like these moronic people whining about having to grind dailies but would have no problem grinding out dungeons for rep. Yeah, that makes much more logical sense.</div></div><hr />

People will never be satisfied in this game. In BC, it was a chore to raise and alt to max level and even begin to gear them. Fast forward to MOP, i hit 90 on my druid alt the other day and within 4 hours of some dung running he is already to do the first 3 bosses of MV. I didn't grind dailys. I am now just for fun and within 4 days of doing some I am almost exalted with several factions. I don't understand why this &quot;grind&quot; qq keeps coming up. Remember, the so called &quot;hardcore raiders&quot; (I use this term lightly because 75% of them were not even around in BC which was true hardcore raiding) don't pay the monthly bills. They are only part of the equation. Blizz is always trying to please everyone and when people qq and qq more and more it just makes those qqer's looked so spoiled. Honestly, if i worked on the development team at blizz, i would be completely unmotivated to even come to work so I could be bashed everyday by some spoiled little brat about how bad my game is even though we all know WOW is an amazing game. Hell, we wouldn't be on this site complaining about everything if it wasn't. Stepping off my soap box now, have a Merry Christmas.</div></div><hr />

It's so ridiculously easy to quest as a tank or a healer now, compared to TBC where you essentially NEEDED to either PAY to respec or NEEDED the help of a friend.<br />
<br />
Seriously. I quested as a holy priest before while waiting for a dungeon queue.... the mobs almost bend over faster than for a shadow spec. And that was BEFORE the 50% chastise buff.<br />

<br />
Chance to get gear from a boss = &quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
Chance to get gear from a boss, plus an extra chance if nothing drops, provided you farm a charm = &quot;Forced to farm charms.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard added a reward to daily quests to make that content more desirable for dungeoneers and raiders. This is a completely new reward, added on top of the existing system. Now dungeoneers and raiders say that they're &quot;forced&quot; to do it. It gives you a good idea of the mindset of some of these min-maxing types.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the ultimate lesson from this is that Blizzard should not incentivize optional content for dungeoneers and raiders, because to dungeoneers and raiders there is no such thing as &quot;optional&quot; content.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's funny that these are the same people who complain about the game being too easy and that it should go back to the BC model, or Classic model, even though it was far harder to gear up and distribute gear back in those days and you were forced to do attunement quests before you could even get into the raids, and you couldn't easily chain-run heroics because you could only do each once a day and had to put together the group yourself...</div></div><hr />

My druid guardian off spec (resto main spec) can easily tank 6-8 mobs at the same (mogu in eternal vale during Golden lotus dailies for an example) time and AoE them down in not to much time.<br />
Secondly if i wanted two healing specs, for what ever reason that may be, why not do the so called &quot;solo content&quot; with a group? <br />
You know what is fun in an mmo, playing with other people. Find a likeminded person on your server and go do the dailies. Ask in general, ask in cities, ask in guild chat you are bound to group up with someone, and chances are, if you are nice to them they are nice to you. If you want a better community it is not that hard. Take an interest in your fellow player, and a great number of times you will end up having a good time.<br />
This is just my humble opinion of course.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* About charms. I think they should ad charms to challenge mode dungeons. That way there is another way to get them, and it is not as steamroll easy as heroics...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard added them because they wanted dungeoneers and raiders to feel like they had a reason to exit the dungeon queue and go do some of the other content if they wanted to. IE, a chance to get some extra gear, maybe.<br />
<br />
The problem is that dungeoneers and raiders don't understand &quot;optional&quot; content. Anything that provides any sort of benefit to their dungeoneering and raiding instantly becomes &quot;required,&quot; even if it's something they didn't have before.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's design intent was never to give additional rewards to dungeoneers and raiders for doing the same content they're already doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said in an earlier post, Blizzard made the obvious flaw of incentivizing optional content for a group of players who don't understand the meaning of the word &quot;optional.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they hadn't added elder charms of good fortune, none of these people would be complaining about being &quot;forced&quot; to do daily quests, and wouldn't complain about not getting extra rolls for loot because they'd never have experienced that.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, Blizzard should add &quot;Seeds of Good Fortune&quot; to the farm, so that these players will be &quot;forced&quot; to literally farm these things that they now so desperately need even though they never needed them before.</div></div><hr />

The only upside to it i could see with BC/vanilla model is to make people talk to each other again while in groups. I think the current system is superior in almost every way, but back then you really befriended others more. You can still do that, but people have gone away from it because it is not needed anymore. You could actually have a conversation with other people. And have fun with them. If you made a mistake you were not instant kicked, you gave it another go.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Running instances with humans back then was more fun than running them with &quot;Bots&quot; now. Even if the &quot;bot&quot; system is more convenient. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
- They want hard content that they can complete without too much difficulty.<br />
<br />
- They want gear that nobody else has, and don't want anybody else to have the gear they have.<br />
<br />
- They want gear to be meaningful and hard to obtain and want it to be easier to buy from vendors.<br />
<br />
- They want more rewards for doing optional content, so long as the rewards either don't matter or the optional content is the content they are already doing.<br />
<br />
- They want more variety and new raid content, so long as it consists of hallways full of mobs interspersed with larger rooms containing bosses that have unique models.<br />
<br />
- Approximately 8 hallways and 16 bosses per raid is preferable, but two raids with 4 hallways and 8 bosses each is also a viable option.</div></div><hr />

And that is the reason for the dual spec system so people who are on a healer can switch to dps to do their dailies, and have their healer for dungeons / raids and scenarios (yes it maybe unbelievable but some people do queue for scenarios as a healer.) And if you read this bit &quot;2) Daily Quests - I am not the only healer in WoW so place healing daily quests in the game.<br />
So, what about the classes that don't have a healing spec? They should be excluded from them because they chose the wrong class? While not all classes can heal (or tank), all of them can DPS. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)&quot;<br />
<br />
So why would they waste time creating dailies for the few classes that have healing abilities (Druids, Priests, Shaman, Monks and Palladins) you would lock out all those classes that don't have specific healing abilities (Warriors, Hunters DK's Rogues, Warlocks and Mages.)<br />
<br />
And on leveling well it has been like that since Vanilla, I think you will find most healer classes leveled as dps it was a lot different back then as you did not have dual spec which I think was introduced in WotLK. <br />
<br />
But in the end it is sort of easier to create dailies, leveling and so on for one spec than to have to duplicate, change or add content just for healers. I think you will find that the daily system has always been for dps ever since it was introduced in WotLK.<br />

<br />
I never talked about creating specific dailies for Healing and tanks. I pointed out that since there are so huge bottlenecks in LFR.. then why are healers and tanks not given the incentive to get those charms helping out in there instead of sending them out to do dailies. Same system we see in LFD where roles that are needed get extra rewards. <br />
<br />
Dual specs were NOT just created to have one healing spec and 1 dps spec. Some ppl have two healing specs and 1 tank spec and 1 healing spec. Those players are in many ways the ppl that keep this game going for what the game has always been known for. Strong trinity system. Blizzard obviously felt the need to push DPS more this expansion - probably because of GW2 and the fear that that dont like trinity would go there. Well... alot of ppl dont like trinity and are still expecting WOW to support a strong trinity system that rewards players for taking up more than one role.<br />
<br />
The fact is - Players that play multiroles in MOP are beeing punished for it. The valor upgrade system leads to less players beeing able to upgrade their offspec role. The LFR loot system is unfriendly to multiroles and is forcing players to even leave a needed role like healer - and quing up as dps instead. <br />
<br />
BLizzard has failed horribly to balance the core of WOW in MOP. THey failed to keep a real incentive for players to play a none dps role that is core to WOW success through all these years. Instead they are directly punishing players that dont take up DPS roles, Making it impossible for them to do part of the endgame content like Brawlers guild - and making other parts of the game harder than it should be like daily quests.<br />
<br />
We are now seeing BLizzard do exact same mistake they did with LFD in Cata. They are not supporting the new LFR system - leaving up to hour long Qs - or even endless ones. Why ? Because the incentive for tanks and healers is zero to do it. The incentive for endgame content is built around DPS so all do it that way. <br />
<br />
This topic should Never be about charms, healing quests only or whatever. You can not take one aspect of WOW out from the rest. Even tho the blue poster showed his ignorance and claimed that LFR Qs have nothing to do with daily charms... the real fact is that healers are doing daily quests while they are needed in LFR BECAUSE the incentive to help out in LFR is zero for needed classes.</div></div><hr />

I did write that post. &quot;I am not the only healer in WoW so place healing daily quests in the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
I added to that. What I seek is more &quot;Role Neutral&quot; daily quest content. eg Firelands. Those quests were OK for all roles. &quot;Throw Bears from a tree&quot; &quot;Kill 6 mobs at Satherias Roost - these NPC's shall help&quot; &quot;Heal injured Orcs on the ground&quot; &quot;Kill spiders - this NPC , she shall assist you&quot; &quot;Go collect Spider Eggs&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
The Blue Poster didn't reply to that at all. For he wishes to portray my request as seeking &quot;Exclusive content for Healers only&quot;. Go see for yourself, the thread is still up.<br />
<br />
As for his reply &quot;Make DPS&quot; he can go to hell TBH. Being forced into one type of content is one thing. If upon reading a request for more Role Neutral content he can only reply with &quot;Change Class&quot; the game can die in a fire. Since when does an MMO developer tell the player which class to play in order to proceed? I thought Blizzards motto was &quot;Bring the Player not the class&quot; - and now he seeks to say &quot;change class&quot;? What a joke.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, as a raider, I have yet to see the point of scenarios. The ones I did, were utterly devoid of story and boiled down to &quot;we throw a few mobs at you&quot;.<br />

Back in Classic and TBC I would have agreed with you.<br />
<br />
But since then Blizzard upped the DPS of Healers and Tanks CONSIDERABLY. Tanks got a bit of a nerf bat in Mop, I agree that questing sucks again.<br />
But they implemented dual spec. You can switch roles w/o penalty or cost as often as you'd like.<br />
<br />
Dual spec alone is the sole reason as to why these whiners are ridiculous and shouldn't even get any attention at all.<br />
<br />
BTW: Needing for off-spec in dungeon may not be &quot;proper etiquette&quot;, but it's a far cry from ninjaing. Ninjaing would be a clothie needing on a BoE epic mail drop so he can sell it in the AH. Well, Blizzard fixed that with the &quot;It gets BoP if you need.&quot; (There will always be retards and assholes on the Internet though, can't fix that)<br />

No I dont want to ONLY go back to doing the tabard system. I want to see a real options where ppl can one day or one week deside they do daily quests and the next they do dungeons.

I unsubed and will not be looking back to MOP while there is zero incentive for needed roles to help out in huge bottlenecks of the core game like LFR. And at the same time that naive blue poster still claimed that it was better to force healers to go do dailies for the lesser charms than to go into LFR and help out and be rewarded with lesser charms.

Yeah, i just don't get their problem, guess anything blizzard does will make them unhappy. I don't feel forced to do any dailies after reverted at the beginning. I don't feel the need to be exalted immediatly. And anybody questing with an healing spec is just plain retarded but guess thats 90% of the Forum-Trolls.<br />
<br />
I love the currrent system, it gives me the freedom to gain my valors the way I WANT TO and not what 20 whiners want on the Forums. Running endless Dungeons makes me sick and im tired of them already after gearing up in heroics! No way i want to get my valors or reps in Heroics, i rather do couple of dailies or LFR/Raids. And if some dont want to change specs for certain tasks then to hell with them in a time where we have dual specs. Gosh i dont remember this kind of outcry pre dual spec that people weren't able to quest as healers....</div></div><hr />

Yes - Scenarios are a joke and take the last part teamwork out of the game. It still helps keep Qs in LFD abit shorter but at the same is creating even bigger bottlenecks in LFR.<br />

I totally dissagree. Dual specs do not give BLizzard the freedom to force everyone to have a DPS spec. Some ppl use dual specs to have 2 healing specs like priests) others have tank and healer. In those cases BLizzard has locked those players out for doing content like Brawlers guild. <br />
<br />
I lvled as holy pala in TBC with a dps friend. I did not feel forced to do it that way. But now Blizzard has created alot more incentives to push ppl into having dps spec with things like Brawlers guild. You can not take a friend in<br />

I agree that its not really ninja. But there are alot of dps ppl whining it is ninjaing. Just like they cried that healers were rolling on dps gear in LFR in DS was ninjaing. BUt again -if the incentive for getting dps gear was not this high - Im pretty sure that those &quot;ninjas&quot; would not be rollling need on offspec items in LFD.<br />

100 % agree. This is about options. Tabards would help. Even buying special tokens for JP to gain 100 rep would do the job. It has been done before. WHen it comes to lesser charms... I want to see a reward system simulare to LFD - BUt used in LFR instead. If healer or Tank is needed in LFR -then those players that sign up for it in those roles get 10 lesser charms for finishing a LFR instance. That way they will get rewarded for helping out in already overfilled DPS Qs in LFR.</div></div><hr />

No Im a Vanilla baby that has seen BLizzard push out their themepark content ideas where they have reacted to huge bottlenecks in their system many times before. I have grown up abit since I played Vanilla tho - and thats what I also expect a game developer to do. Not do the same mistakes over and over again but instead be ready to adjust when things go wrong - like 1 hour long Qs in LFR.<br />

And at the same time that naive blue poster still claimed that it was better to force healers to go do dailies for the lesser charms than to go into LFR and help out and be rewarded with lesser charms. If I were that blue poster I would resign today cause saying something like that just shows he has zero understanding of the game.<br />
<br />
LoL, seriously in my opinion you have zero understanding of an MMO and seem to be the real ignorant :) <br />
And what the heck are you doing here if you &quot;unsubed&quot; anyways ? Oh yeah trolls, we have enough of you in game so thanks for unsubscribing .. kkthxbb</div></div><hr />

<br />
Call to arm for LFR would be nice to lower queue times. I don't really care about the charms-idea though, b/c I hate doing LFR on my raiding main. :D<br />
<br />
Still - ppl should not be forced to respec because 1 aspect of the endgame pushes them that way. The real incentive should be about having a tank/healer role cause it would help the co-op content that is core of WOW even more. <br />
<br />
Stats are showing that multirole classes like paladins and druids are the least played classes in MOP. Those classes can be a key to guaranty good flow of content like LFD and LFR. The incentive for playing that way is zero atm - cause new systems like ilvl valor system is making those multi role classes more gimped with more ilvl difference from others that we have ever seen in the game.<br />
<br />
I dont want to see LFR in game at all. But BLizzard needs to support their new systems if they put them into the game. 1 hour up to endless Qs for LFR is not helping the game at all right now. Alts are passed the rep grind - now stuck in those Qs. Most of these alts are DPS ofc and are focusing on getting better dps gear to do those dam dailies faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this. But we don't know why the queues are so long. <br />
Back in the day peeps said &quot;If there were more classes that could tank, It would be faster to find groups&quot;. Well Blizzard implemented DKs and now Monks. Guess what: Didn't work.<br />
Ultimately players want to DPS because it's responsibility and worry free.<br />
<br />
As far as healers in LFR go: I think most healers don't like LFR-healing because it's FUCKING BORING AS HELL. All I do as a healer is stand there and spam my AoE stuff and yell at morons that are too stupid to stand in green/blue/yellow stuff. For a healer to have fun, the encounter needs to be challenging. He needs to be driven to his limits.<br />
<br />
DPS doesn't need that. They have recount, which is motivation enough to go &quot;all out&quot;.<br />
Tanks ... well I hate tanking in LFR too, because It's annoying as fuck to constantly die, despite doing everything by the book, because the random moron you got assigned as a co-tank is too stupid to find the frigging &quot;taunt&quot; spell....<br />
<br />
Sorry for the choice of words, but I want to convey just how much it pisses me off to be anything but DPS in LFR.<br />
<br />
<br />
How is throwing bears from a tree &quot;DPS&quot;? How is planting vines in firelands DPS? How is escorting the mob up the hill to the tower DPS? How is healing the injured orcs at firelands DPS? How is running around a cave hitting runes on the ground DPS?<br />

Seriously if you are this offended about something as optional like Charms of good fortune, then how on earth could you play WoW up to this point?<br />
<br />
Leveling always meant &quot;kill stuff, do quests&quot;.<br />
Rep grinding always meant &quot;kill stuff&quot; often even MOB KILLS ONLY like Timber Maw or Kurenai.<br />
Quests were always a part of the game and always were designed with DPS in mind.<br />
<br />
Seriously: Group up, let your partner go crazy on pulls and heal him/her.<br />
<br />
I quest with my friend, he is a tank, I am a shadow priest. I just love it when he pulls the whole place and I can DPS free of worries.<br />
<br />
Oh, wait you actually assume that those kind of players crying have friends or guildmates they would run dailies with, well thats rubbish :) <br />
You now only make him jealous that you can chain pull and down 10 mobs at once with an tank or healer in the group and he will complain about that this has nothing todo with the fundamentals of an MMO, its a game you play alone as healer and kill everything faster then a stupid dps !! .... so come on teaming up is not an options for trolls!<br />

Cata daily quests. I was talking about the past (TBC/Vanilla/Wrath).<br />
<br />
Yes - I agree that the fun part of healing and tanking in LFR is not great. Thats why it need the extra incentives in terms of rewards to get players doing it. It can not be over the top tho so that ppl that dont even have healing or tanking gear are doing it that way. But tbh... right now many of the ppl that Q up as healers dont have any healing gear at all and just dps to cheat the Qs. Cause the current ilvl check system does not check gear based on role and that can lead to wipes and annoyance. <br />
<br />
There are many ways to reward ppl for taking part in LFR - charms would be a good way cause it would not push DPS classes away from doing their dailies (specially designed for dps to be most efficent) - but be rewarding for healers and tanks that dont have as high DPS.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the blue poster was just frustrated they are human after all. And some of the things they have to put up with would do many of us in. And I did see something along the lines of the new raid offering Shado Pan rep. Yes not a hell of a lot but could be they are listening to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
But I think the main thing doing what they did is again to slow content consumption as we all know in Cata you could grind to exalted with a faction too easily in dungeons and then to some extent have nothing to do. And that was the main problem for some in Cata and if not for the need for VP's most would stop doing dungeons altogether. (And in the end most did. I know I did stop running dungeons because I had all the rep I needed and VP's that in the end became useless.)<br />
<br />
Heck even now I pick and choose what dailies I want to do because can't be stuffed doing them all a case of being burnt out by dailies, even the new Shieldwall ones I do every so often mainly because the gear the QM's have in some respects is crap gear. When you can get a LFR item be better than a 496 VP item then something is very wrong.</div></div><hr />

Yes - LFR system is very broken atm and BLizzard should have come up with ways to improve it by now. From my point of view... they should never have implemented it with these lootrules we see now that are pushing the few tanks and healers that are around into doing it in DPS spec so they can do dailies and Brawlers guild faster. That again leads to endless Q times for LFR.<br />
<br />
In terms of valor gear for offspecs. Simply not viable anymore. LFR is the only way to get offspec gear. Players are upgrading their mainspec gear with valor points now. Pre MOP - those multirole classes were able to buy valor gear when their main spec had best possible gear for valor. This wont happen now - leading to bigger gaps in ilvl between offspec role and main specs. That again pushes ppl away from taking on offspec roles like healer or tank cause like we all know... ppl in worse gear are not treated very well in like LFD and LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I added to that. What I seek is more &quot;Role Neutral&quot; daily quest content. eg Firelands. Those quests were OK for all roles. &quot;Throw Bears from a tree&quot; &quot;Kill 6 mobs at Satherias Roost - these NPC's shall help&quot; &quot;Heal injured Orcs on the ground&quot; &quot;Kill spiders - this NPC , she shall assist you&quot; &quot;Go collect Spider Eggs&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
The Blue Poster didn't reply to that at all. For he wishes to portray my request as seeking &quot;Exclusive content for Healers only&quot;. Go see for yourself, the thread is still up.<br />
<br />
As for his reply &quot;Make DPS&quot; he can go to hell TBH. Being forced into one type of content is one thing. If upon reading a request for more Role Neutral content he can only reply with &quot;Change Class&quot; the game can die in a fire. Since when does an MMO developer tell the player which class to play in order to proceed? I thought Blizzards motto was &quot;Bring the Player not the class&quot; - and now he seeks to say &quot;change class&quot;? What a joke.<br />
<br />
Ahh k yeah I did forget the few and that is few quests / dailies that were class / spec neutral there are a few in MoP like the collecting ones at Whitepetal Lake and Mistfall Village and Setting Sun Garrison main problem there is the linearity of the dailies in that you still have to kill stuff to get to those collecting ones. Maybe they should have taken out the linearity but not sure how they would do it.<br />

It most likely wont be available for JPs. LFR will provide the upgraded gear you need. That was their goal at least but considering the current issues with LFR Qs - they might change their mind on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main problem I have with LFR at the moment is the loot system, yes while sort of better the annoyance of hoping you get the item you want being overshadowed that say you go in as a hunter and there are 2 other hunters in the group both have the item you are after. Kill boss loot comes up you get nothing, and the probability that one of the other hunters got a duplicate of that item that they don't need. And because you can't trade to someone who does need the item it becomes a waste of an item though I can see why they stopped the trading bit but still.<br />
<br />
Heck on my shaman I did Nightmare of Shekzeer on my shaman and one week got the legs token, didn't need it as got the 496 version, the next week same boss won same token again. Why they can't do the loot like Horseman or Direbrew will never know, though I spose again to allow for Offspec but all the same very annoying system.<br />
<br />
Brawlers Guild can't be bothered not paying exorbitant prices on the BMAH for 1v1 pve battling.<br />
<br />
And well yes unfortunately there are too many mean people in this game when in comes to LFD and lower geared folks.</div></div><hr />

My only gripe is what players have to do for daily quests. Why do players need to kill 20 of a certain mob for a quest that is only completed once a day for the same amount of rep as a quest that requires to kill 1 special mob? On top of that, the RNG in the game is ridiculous when it comes to gathering quests. Kill 10+ mobs to finally get maybe 2 or 3 items of the 6 needed for the quest. Pretty clear with this expansion, Blizz has run out of creativity. But it's their game.</div></div><hr />

Unsub today and move on and quit complaining.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the daily system. If you're a &quot;raider&quot; you do what you have to do and stop whining. I raided hardcore Vanilla through Wrath and decided I wanted more time away. Years ago, we were expected to fill our inventory with consumables before coming to raids. I had to roll an alt to farm potions, flask materials, elixirs and not set foot in AQ40 without having about 2 stacks of every relevant trick for my class - today a raiding support character isn't even considered, it's just an alt. And this was when we were expected to be in a raid 7 days a week. Today you gather 90 tokens (many dailies of which offer 2) per week and raid 2-3 days. Are you people serious? You're calling yourself competitive raiders and complaining when you have 4 days off to get this junk done? &quot;Oh but my alts!&quot; is not an excuse, unless you are a World guild that absolutely requires certain classes to be available to them in a pinch you're just throwing out a straw man argument, your alts will probably never be called on.<br />
<br />
The blue was spot on calling people out. The Wrath system was garbage and for some reason they let it persist. Further, a person that refuses to DPS to get their job outside of raiding done (and won't spend the massive amount of gold you make off them to respec back afterwards, you don't even need to reglyph ffs) is not a real gamer and part of the reason this game has gone away from the real MMO genre. That's just another lazy person I'm glad I never had the displeasure of having to work through Ulduar Hardmodes to hit a server first with. My old guild consisted of people who carried stacks of glyphs with them to reglyph mid-raid back when you had to really pay to reglyph. Today, it's brainless to reglyph and all completely situational, I wonder if they complain about that, too?<br />
<br />
In the end, the real difference between a solid progression guild of yesteryear and today is that they are infested with people who cannot be counted on to put in the effort that is presented to them. If you played this card several years ago, you would have been considered a casual wannabe, sat, and probably gkicked sooner or later. Today complaining about being asked to do the little extras results in massive complaints. I'm pretty sure I made the right choice to get away from this, I saw it coming at the intro of Cataclysm when people were expected to play like they knew what they were doing and they complained all the way through it.<br />
<br />
Also, if they remove the daily system and force dungeons on me and my alts for rep, I'm out.<br />
<br />
When I was your age, I had to walk to school. I had to walk barefoot, in the snow, carrying my sister(and she's a big girl, uphill both ways..... I raided in Vanilla too. Let's not try to con Cata/Mop babies with stories of how &quot;difficult&quot; it was for us to us 4-7 abilities and use the auction house to buy what we needed so we'd have time to use our &quot;hard earned&quot; pve gear to utterly faceroll in bg's. I saw this + busted out laughing./ Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can completely go at my own pace. No waiting for others<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
Equip Tabard. Queue for dungeon. Wait 35 minutes. Hopefully it's not a bad group. Kill trash. Kill 3-5 bosses. Good group, only took 20 minutes<br />
Queue for dungeon. Wait 40 minutes. Got a bad group. This dungeon takes about 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
1 Hour 35 minutes later, I've killed the same old trash, and the same old bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh man, that was so much better.<br />
<br />
Why do people not understand that putting on a tabard and clearing dungeons over and over.. -is the same logistical effort and reasoning- as doing dailies solo and clearing the same quests over and over?<br />
<br />
It's the same exact god damn thing!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not trying to nitpick here, but I'm calling B.S. on this. Please define, &quot;top guild&quot;<br />
<br />
Because I'm no where near in a &quot;top guild&quot; anymore. We were US 200ish back in Cata, but had a slow start due to a few issues we had in October and early November. We're back up to around US 600, and we're 4/6H-6/6-4/4 . Clearly not a &quot;top&quot; guild. That being said,<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no problems getting flasks, pots, Valor points, charms, food, whatever. Here's the secret.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the guild pitches in. One person farms Tiger Meat for raid feasts. Two people farm Danio for 20 minutes before raid time. One to two people farm herbs. The end result of this is: Everyone has food. Will always have food. We have more flasks and golden lotus than we could ever imagine using. We have more stat pots than we could use.<br />
<br />
Stop treating this like a single player MMO and make your &quot;top guild&quot; chip in and get shit done the right way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoted for Truth.<br />
<br />
I remember when dailies only gave you a minimal amount of gold, yet people still had the incentive to do them. Now they give you a chance at FREE GEAR that is relevant to the raid tier, but that's just asking too much.<br />
<br />
Summary: People did dailies when they didn't reward anything, didn't complain. People do dailies when the reward something, complain.<br />
<br />
My absolute favorite quote from the MMO-Champion forums was someone saying that &quot;this entire community should be isolated and studied for scientific research.&quot; It's conversations like this thread, and the WoW-Forums, that make me guffaw thinking back at that quote.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well said, Thank you</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ferocity</div><div class="date">2012-12-25, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cata daily quests. I was talking about the past (TBC/Vanilla/Wrath).<br />
PreMoP dailies were completely optional. All BoP mats like warbeads someone mentioned before were for cosmetic stuff like Nagrand mounts. Guilds were also helping healers and tanks with consumables/crafts be there any problem. You could completely skip quests and do only group content on your tanks/healers. Outside of Molten Front dailies (which were also mostly for cosmetic stuff) there weren't much &quot;neutral&quot; dailies though, but they just weren't pushed in the face of players.<br />
<br />
Current problem can be also expressed this way: imagine each time you want to play WoW, you have to play Tetris (or some other completely different game of completely different genre) for hour or two. And when you are finally done with it, you can barely even make any dungeon group as friends/guildies are busy &quot;playing Tetris&quot;. It isn't healthy.<br />
<br />
And don't even mention +300 buff food, 16 farm slots are far from enough if you raid less or more regularly, and be it 300 or 275 it involves double or triple more time of mass-murdering and fishing than before. You can't even buy food from AH, at least on my server, if there is occasionally some food there - it costs colossal amounts of gold as supply is far-far-far below demand.<br />
<br />
Equip Tabard. Queue for dungeon. Wait 35 minutes. Hopefully it's not a bad group. Kill trash. Kill 3-5 bosses. Good group, only took 20 minutes<br />
Queue for dungeon. Wait 40 minutes. Got a bad group. This dungeon takes about 40 minutes.<br />
Tabard or similar solution can greatly co-exist with dailies. DPS people can pew-pew mobs very fast and get rep from dailies while being in queue. For shield-tanks and healers it takes very long to kill anything, with mobs interrupting them while they try to loot quest objects before they are stolen by other players during fight. This your 35-40 minutes long queue times are same as for them attempting to kill mobs: takes forever with lots of nerves wasted. And queues won't be shorter if dailies will remain the only source of rep and charms. When tanks/healers are done with dailies, they ain't having time/wish to play more and do dungeons (which also give very subpar rewards, especially in comparison to dailies, and thus completely no reasons to run them).</div></div><hr />

Otherwise keep telling people to leave and they will and your daily questing bullshit won't remain untouched next expansion. The WoW community is it's own worst enemy.</div></div><hr />

I remember when dailies only gave you a minimal amount of gold, yet people still had the incentive to do them. Now they give you a chance at FREE GEAR that is relevant to the raid tier, but that's just asking too much.<br />
<br />
Summary: People did dailies when they didn't reward anything, didn't complain. People do dailies when the reward something, complain.<br />
<br />
My absolute favorite quote from the MMO-Champion forums was someone saying that &quot;this entire community should be isolated and studied for scientific research.&quot; It's conversations like this thread, and the WoW-Forums, that make me guffaw thinking back at that quote.<br />
<br />
I played alot of the Daily quests in TBC. I did it not for the any rep - and I did it not for items. I did it for some extra gold and because they were actually pretty interesting. Back then you could only do 10 daily quests. Having such low limit makes it less of a grind and gates the content in a better way. It also gave BLizzard not the same urge to throw out endless lines of go kill. pick up, and return quests we now are seeing. 5 really good and interesting quests are better than 35 bad and the same quests. That way ppl will do them - for the fun on it rather than for some extra rewards.<br />
<br />
Secondly... NEVER before have we seen BLizzard double gate gear with both rep and valor. This fact increases the feeling of forced content where ppl will have to do certain things to progress their characters. Telling ppl to skip that and at the same time slow down on character progress is not a solution to the problem.<br />
<br />
I dont care if we have daily quests. But I do care if they are the only way to gain stuff like those charms. Because daily quests in its current form are the lowest of low when it comes to endgame content in WOW. Players should always have options on how to do content to move towards progression. Telling them to not progress is not going to help WOW one bit.<br />
<br />
I also care when I see up to 1 hour Qs in endgame content like LFR - even during peak times. Thats not acceptable for a supported feature in the game. Things need to be balanced much better when it comes to trinity roles in the game to make it more enjoyable. And best way in my opinion to balance that is to not force upon ppl all the dps incentive content that MOP has added. Be that daily quests or Brawler's guild. I expected Blizzard to react and fix those issues within a month when everyone saw where LFR Qs were heading. They did not - and thats not acceptable.</div></div><hr />

I just get the feeling that no matter how much we tell them that the system is borked there will be no changes. That is not to say that many of the changes have not been really good and more than not Blizz is dead on with what needs fixing; it's just some really huge game style changes that are forcing people out. They need to stop trying to reinvent the game and focus more on content and encounters. If I can level an alt without repeating any quests all the way to max level then we have a really good replayable game. <br />
<br />
I just let my sub expire and don't plan to reup either until there are some major changes made to the daily situation or the LFR loot system. Of course I will pop back in for another major content patch or xpac but my days of playing WoW every day are gone. Why they can't see that their subscription numbers started to drop when they started making huge changes after TBC. How many here would play on an official TBC server? I certainly would, even pay extra for it.</div></div><hr />

Granted it's frustrating as hell to get LFR items, but in all honesty, I wasn't expecting them to drop just because I logged on.<br />
<br />
It's weird really, that I'm a normal casual and all these others complain that it's too hard to do Dailies, Healers can group with friends (which is odd considering this is a MMORPG afterall, right?) I would like to see Spec-specific Dailies, would be cool to see stuff like tanking dailies or healing dailies, but that's neither here nor there.<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying the game even with the dailies. And to be fair, I was raiding long before I had Valor and Justice items, Heroic LFD stuff works like a charm. The complaining is getting a bit old &lt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Im currently in a top guild. (ps I raid 20-25 hours a week).<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: Those new players are so funny.<br />
<br />
Mistake of Blizzards was to kick at least 90 % of the BC raiders since :<br />
<br />
WRATH : Naxxramas 2.0 - Affliction revamp 3.1 :p - ToC Too SOON BRO and shitty raid - ICC 10 Months :( with rollface debuff crap and obviously no shared ID, Holy SH!T.<br />
<br />
CATA: Pissing on 25 mans gratz dude, great move - Those dungeons where goddam shitty - Dragon Soul the worst, really the worst sh!t ever, bad design, bad encounter, no background with ICC syndromes.<br />
<br />
Just to be sure that most of BC raiders delete the WoW folder<br />
<br />
LFR... Oh lord LFR.... when one year before we could have 3 or 4 &quot; 25 mans pick up &quot; for at least 10/ 13 HM.<br />
<br />
Dead Servers issues :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
2013 : Blizzard open its eyes and see the customers they wanted, some &quot; commercials consumers as players &quot; crying for poneyepicmail &quot; again... <br />
<br />
Got what you have looking for, nice job Blizz.<br />
<br />
This game could have been a long long stoy with great community but the selfish IZ STRONKER BRO.<br />
<br />
