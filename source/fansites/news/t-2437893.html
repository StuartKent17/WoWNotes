With the PvP talent and the trait (single or stacked) it dealt quite a bit of damage,with the range increase,it allowed rogues to sweep areas the size of an average arena clean in a matter of seconds</div></div><hr />

It's used in rbgs. Rogues can do stupid amounts of aoe damage in the initial fight over mid in certain bgs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While in arena this is totally usless.<br />
<br />
While in rated bgs you still have to play sub.<br />
<br />
Top priority pvp changes.....where are the dk and lock buffs?</div></div><hr />

I'm just calling it junk because it's essentially just digital stuff that doesn't mean much in a real world context but I want them all because I'm a collector, and I'm annoyed at the fact collecting it all is going to be the worst grind I've had to do in WoW's entire lifespan.<br />
<br />
And because, at least according to the comments section of every Q&amp;A, cosmetic stuff &quot;doesn't matter&quot; to most players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So part of your rogue fun factor was doing OP AoE in PvP on a class that already kicks butt? If your hinge on Rogue was that fickle to begin with then it begs the question why you played the class in the first place.<br />

<br />
Are you literally not reading a thing people are telling you? The perk was allowing rogues to do crazy AoE in PvP, therefore people precisely WERE using it. That's WHY it got nerfed. Goodness gracious...</div></div><hr />

I clearly said the fun factor is decreased for me with this on top of the sub nerfs. Maybe your hinge on reading comprehension is too fickle.</div></div><hr />

You quoted them clearly replying to someone else. What were you saying about people questioning your reading comprehension?</div></div><hr />

You might want to brush up on your reading comprehension too there.</div></div><hr />

It seems they really messed up there, I've got 2 rogue buddies who are pretty much switching traits on a weekly basis because a new op combination of traits is found, and later nerfed. First it was the stupid Assasination opener burst, then Shrouded Suffocation, now this...</div></div><hr />

Though even with targeting named mobs, i still have to get anything, besides that one 310 boe myself)<br />
<br />
Drop chances are still extremely low (anekdotical of course. the group i do them with got a few 325 boe, and 2 or 3 pets thusfar)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also while I dont know the RBG scene, i figure they do wound poison to do mass AoE Mortal Strikesque debuff(if wound still does that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, is not working on that way... I've drop pets without killing any of the mob related: I got Barnaby killing Saurok and zero pitares, Littlehoof without killing any Deer or Stags. Based on my experience, the loot table is ALSO related to the Island more than the single type of mobs.</div></div><hr />
