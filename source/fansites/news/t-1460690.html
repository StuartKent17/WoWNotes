Warlords of Draenor - PvP Update<br />
Warlords of Draenor will introduce tons of new features and updates to improve and expand upon many aspects of World of Warcraft, including the PvP experience. We gave you a first look at some of our PvP plans BlizzCon, and as with any development process, plans can sometimes change as they—well—develop. We’d like to share a few of those changes with you today.<br />
<br />
The Tale of Trial of the Gladiator<br />
At BlizzCon, we unveiled plans for a new form of ranked Arena competition called the Trial of the Gladiator, a mode of play that would available during certain hours and which would require players to use a special Trial-only set of gear. The goal was to concentrate high-level competition to specific times, to better match players against competitive opponents, and to make exploitation more difficult.<br />
<br />
While there were a lot of potential benefits to that system, ultimately we agree with some of the concerns community has raised about the way it worked. Ultimately, players who couldn’t play during the pre-set times for Trial of the Gladiator might feel like they’re missing out, and it was possible that normal Arena games would lose a lot of their replay value without rating to push for. Because of these issues, we’ve decided not to continue development of Trial of the Gladiator and to focus our efforts on giving players more ways to find PvP that suits them—so here’s what we’re doing instead:<br />
<br />
Arena for Everyone: Skirmishes<br />
You might recall the Skirmish feature that went alongside ranked Arena play when that feature was first introduced. It was virtually identical to ranked play, with the exception that there was no ladder or rating involved. However, Skirmishes felt very redundant at the time, and few players took advantage of them, so they were removed with the release of Cataclysm. However, as more and more players get involved in PvP, a higher demand for a form of “lower-pressure” Arena gameplay made us think it was time to revisit the Skirmish idea . . . and make a few important improvements along the way.<br />
<br />
In Warlords of Draenor, Skirmishes will return as a form of unranked Arena play that will allow you to queue for 2v2 or 3v3 battles with friends or by yourself. Winning a Skirmish will reward you with Honor and a random bonus, which could be gold, more Honor, a small amount of Conquest Points, or possibly something entirely different. We think this will be a great way for players who haven’t tried Arenas before to get their feet wet, and will allow experienced players to experiment with alternate specs or builds without worrying about tanking their rating.<br />
<br />
But Wait, There’s More: Spectator Invite System<br />
While Skirmishes should provide a great opportunity for some more laid-back PvP gameplay, we also wanted to address top-end competition as well. Tournament organizers, often with the use of various third-party add-ons, have been able to piece together a “spectator mode” of sorts and run online tournaments, but they’ve been required to jump through several hoops to actually make that work. We’d like to simplify that process and put more power in the hands of add-on developers so that community-run tournaments will be easier to organize, manage, and broadcast.<br />
<br />
Our new Spectator Invite system will allow a match organizer to invite two teams to play against each other in a PvP spectacle called a War Game. Then, when the match begins, everyone in the match organizer’s party will be able to watch those two teams duke it out. We’ll also be opening this feature up to add-on developers so they can come up with tools for tournament organizers to customize how the match is presented on the screen. Finally, we’ll be providing Tournament Mode gear—a special set of gear that can only be used in War Games—to help tournament runners ensure that all players are on equal footing.<br />
<br />
We’re excited for these new features, and we feel they’ll allow a much broader spectrum of players to be able to find a type of PvP gameplay they enjoy. Whether you’re looking to compete against the best of the best in a tournament or just want to hang out and relax with a little bloodshed, we hope these updates provide something for the PvPer in you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder how many people will use the Spectator Mode outside of tourneys. I know a lot of us just want to watch random arenas, and that isn't accomplished here. Great for tourneys tho.<br />
<br />
Given how fast Arenas are, it'll be interesting to see how they tune skirmishes. If the honor gain at a 50% win rate is better than bgs we might see a huge shift. If there's experience rewarded it might be a fast way of power leveling at lower arena brackets too.</div></div><hr />

On a brighter note, glad Skirmishes are back.</div></div><hr />

Spectating is only for wargames, so you can't actually do it for ranked arena play.</div></div><hr />

this is exactly why they normally don't release information about something until its done. however the community keeps requesting that they want updates as soon as possible. its a lose-lose situation for them. either they don't announce stuff until its done and people get pissed cause they are impatient and want new updates now or they announce stuff too early in development and when it gets scratched people get pissed again. if the community is gunna demand new features be announced early on then they are gunna have to live with the fact that not all of them will end up in the game.</div></div><hr />

Skirmishes were like 80% of my play time a couple expansions ago. I know many people don't consider it a game changing feature, but it is a reason for me to subscribe, especially with potential gold game so I can pay my damn repair bills without doing stuff I dislike.<br />

<br />
I don't think so, especially if they kept the 3v3 requirement. Not a whole lot of 3v3 skirmishes happened back in the day. Although, with the new rewards, that could definitely change.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was a bit high as well, considering you can probably pay a little more to get the free 90 and have an extra wow account for a month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine they'll make conquest points a rare and small prize, considering honor and gold are potential rewards. I (am purely estimating) would expect something like 40% honor 40% gold 10% conquest. It would be a bad thing to reduce incentive to do regular arena. Also you can get conquest from regular bg's as it is, so this wouldn't make much sense. You can't currently queue for &quot;regular arena&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firebert</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be a bad thing to reduce incentive to do regular arena.<br />
50% win rate in Skirmish (assuming good matchmaking) &gt; 50% win rate in Arena, simply because solo queuing for something is so much easier (and more successful) than forming groups.<br />
<br />
Also you can get conquest from regular bg's as it is, so this wouldn't make much sense.<br />
50% win rate in Skirmish (assuming good matchmaking) &gt; sub-50% win rate from Random BGs with Strand and Silvershard Mines banned when AV or IoC are not Call to Arms. With good Conquest generation in Skirmishes, this will pull more Alliance out of random battlegrounds when those conditions are met and further worsen the Horde BG queue times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So lets say in skirmishes you get a small (said by blizzard) conquest bonus sometimes (lets say 90 and 20% to be nice). We'll say you can finish one skirmish every 5 minutes (to be nice, again) and you win 50% of them. <br />
<br />
It takes ~ 10 arena wins right now to cap 1800 points unless you have a higher rating (which we'll disregard because skirmishes don't give rating.) We'll say rated arenas last ~10 minutes each because of healers existing.<br />
<br />
For skirmishes 1800/90=20 point bearing wins*5=100 wins likely due to rare conquest point gain. 100*5 minutes = 500 minutes =8 hours and 20 minutes of skirmishes.<br />
<br />
For rated arenas at a 50% win rate, 20 games*10 minutes = 3 hours 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
I disregarded queue times because we have no way of knowing which will have greater queue times.<br />
<br />
If 5 hours is worth not having to find a partner then by all means I encourage people to only get points from queuing.<br />
<br />
Also if you think conquest point wins will be higher and more often, I simply disagree with you.<br />
<br />
Edit: P.S. I'm saying this as someone who loved skirmishes dearly when they existed. They probably sucked up about 50% of my play time. I also arena'd with partners. Skirmishes were for fun and practice.</div></div><hr />

So lets say that the current Call to Arms isn't AV or IoC, and you have SotA and SSM banned. Current Alliance win rate for the remaining BGs is 51.52%. 150CP for the first win of the day, 75 thereafter, cap of 1800. Assume every BG lasts 15m (fast WSG wins, slow AV battles cancel).<br />
<br />
1800 = 150 + 1650 = 23 BGs @ 51.52% win rate = ~45 BGs at 15 minutes each = ~670 minutes (not rounding) = ~11 hours 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Skirmishes are better.<br />
<br />
EDIT: During AV Call to Arms, the time drops to 7h 20m. During IoC Call to Arms, it drops further to 6h 45m. Alliance will be spamming Skirmishes during the time IoC or AV isn't Call to Arms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pwellzor</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So lets say that the current Call to Arms isn't AV or IoC, and you have SotA and SSM banned. Current Alliance win rate for the remaining BGs is 51.52%. 150CP for the first win of the day, 75 thereafter, cap of 1800. Assume every BG lasts 15m (fast WSG wins, slow AV battles cancel).<br />

And even I missed that. That's 16h 40m.<br />
<br />
In which case, spamming Skirmishes is about as good as spamming Silvershard Mines (35.5% win rate) Call to Arms (~16h 11m).<br />
<br />
In order for Skirmishes to beat Random BGing with standard bans, they must give more than ~161 Conquest an hour. With 20 skirmishes an hour, winning half, that's an average of ~32.25 Conquest a win. Probably not gonna happen.<br />

Do you guys even play for fun? Are you really just doing what you 'have to do' to get capped asap? And for what? For better gear to do stuff you don't really like to do to get even more points? This game isn't about the most efficient route to some point cap, it's about fun!</div></div><hr />

Just edit the &quot;you guys&quot; part. I said in a previous post that skirmishes with 0 rewards were like half of my play time when they existed. I loved them.</div></div><hr />

I'd definitely rather grind them than BGs to gear up some alts since they took away Trial's gear equality. That would have been great for playing alts in to get them up to par quickly. Still really disappointed that they are not going to have all the games at the same time because that would have given them an opportunity to closely monitor the games and the reports to catch out the hacking. People (and Blizzard) seem to deny hacking is a problem and yet whenever I queue up it's about a 2/3 chance it's against a blatantly hacking side from an Oceanic server where Blizzard does absolutely nothing to stop it. Some of the time they're so terrible that you can beat them anyway but it's really made rating pointless when so many people just hack their way to the top and make it impossible for real PVP to happen. <br />
<br />
I don't care if Trial would have meant you couldn't have gotten rating or whatever but I'd rather I could do it where hackers get banned rather than nothing gets done to them. I'd have to say the majority of people complaining about the time constraints are just hackers that don't want to get caught.</div></div><hr />

I agree. That went away when they added resilience (I was there) and hasn't ever come back. I don't even have an actual solution, either, because if they removed that and &quot;PVP Powah&quot; then there'd be no PVP gear to chase. So be prepared to bend over for everybody with more free time than you to PVP. So glad I finally moved to a PVE server. Never again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am a fanboy too. Been playing WoW non stop since Molten Core. <br />
<br />
There are things that I like about the expansion. Like the lore and as a Horde player the chance to meet some of the greatest Orc heroes. I like the garrison system as well, though I am skeptical about it and don't want to turn into another HalfHill Farm like feature. <br />
<br />
What I don't like about this expac are-<br />
<br />
<br />
Lack of many new features<br />
Lack of new classes/races (specially no new races)<br />
Shifting of gear customization from player control (gems, reforge, enchanting) to game controlled (pure RNG)<br />
<br />
<br />
Specially the last feature. So what if people uses AMR to reforge/gem their gear. But it at least gives us a chance to &quot;fix&quot; a poorly itemized loot drop to something more meaningful. <br />
<br />
The PvP changes is yet another feature they are removing because they couldn't solve the issues that player feedback listed. This is very poor architecture and program management. And shows general lack of experience of Blizzard as a whole in the software dev process. And ironically enough, this has happened before -- recall the &quot;Path of the Titans&quot; fiasco with Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
As a software developer, when I market a feature and can't deliver on it because of architectural holes, the marketing team quickly loses faith on you. As does upper management. Every software dev company has its own versions of feature wishlists - things it would love to do if time permits. But they never advertise them unless they can deliver it. Since this is very bad PR and loses both customer as well as Investor faith. If I do what Blizzard did in my line of business, my customers would happily tear me apart and either demand a massive cut in cost or go to another vendor. <br />
<br />
Blizzard being a monopoly gets away with it. They will still charge the $39 for the expansion and people (including myself) will still pay it happily. This is a problem. And as long as Blizz holds the monopoly in the MMO market, there's no way around it. We can whine as much as we like; but they will do damn well what they please, with little to no ramifications.</div></div><hr />

Aah. So this feature also goes the &quot;Path of the Titans&quot; route. Wonder what else will get axed from this &quot;expansion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Path of the Titans was going to be a terrible feature, it was axed for a reason.<br />
<br />
It would've just been more of the old prime glyphs, but not even class-specific. Mandatory and boring, impossible to balance and therefore cookie-cutter. And you discovered them via archaeology. Awful idea. Check it out, here's some of them:<br />
<br />
<br />
Some examples for ancient glyphs available through the Path of Golganneth include:<br />
<br />
Rank I<br />
Earth's Embrace - Physical damage taken reduced by 4%.<br />
Battle Hardened - Reduces the duration of Bleed and Stun effects by 20%.<br />
Rank II<br />
Medic - Bandages heal targets by an additional 30%.<br />
Fortification - instant - 5 min cooldown - Nearby allies take 10% less damage for 6 sec.<br />
Rank III<br />
Breakthrough - instant - 5 min cooldown - Increases damage dealt by 10% for 10 sec. Only usable after you deal a critical strike.<br />

Yeah, which is more than the raid browser ever utilized. Oh, and Scenarios, all that development time, completely void of activity post pandaria. <br />
<br />
A. More than 3 people used skirmishes. I remember 10 second queues and never seeing the same person for days.<br />
B. The thing about pvp features like skirmishes is, you never really have to update them. Use the same arenas that have always been around and theyre good forever. PvP has the advantage that players change, so you dont constantly have to skinner box them.</div></div><hr />

PVP gear is the BEST pvp gear around for pvp, if you are using some pve pieces your just hurting yourself(and your healer) I mean you may be able to lol with it is Bg's but now with the increased item level,there is no reason to go with pve gear.<br />

except it was offered only at a fixed time, a mjority of pvp'rs are pvprs coz we could not survive the harsh strict schedules of raiding, we definately don't want that coming to pvp.Focusign pvp at a specific time will also dry up pvp at other non-trial times.<br />

if you have skill you can beat a full grevious player with only blue item been there done that<br />
<br />
Good luck beating a fully grievous hunter as a blue geared hunter. he could do his pve rotation standing still and you would have 0% chance of beating spirit bond.</div></div><hr />

It also could just be cosmetic.<br />

Bandages are better than spirit bond.</div></div><hr />

8k passive healing every 2 seconds is extremely strong, especially against undergeared characters when you outpace their damage in the first place. But thanks for the pointless addition.</div></div><hr />

There would be rules for it of course, mainly being NO tanks and NO healers allowed in the 1v1 Skrimishes.</div></div><hr />

And I totally agree with you, I'd love for them to add 1v1 in Skirmishes. I'm also hoping (and assuming) it'll be free of any gimmicks like Dampening. I don't know if I'd rule out healers though, but tanks. Totally.</div></div><hr />

Having to do tons of PvE and other uninteresting content is really bothersome for a PvPer. IMO, just an perfect change for the game! :)</div></div><hr />
