Ion Hazzikostas - Keynote Speaker at PAX West<br />

Ion Hazzikostas - Warcraft Lore Interview<br />
Gameinformer had the opportunity to talk to Ion Hazzikostas (https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/08/14/a-look-inside-how-blizzard-maintains-world-of-warcrafts-lore) recently about how Blizzard maintains the Warcraft lore.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Loremasters at Blizzard take care of research requests, review publications and lore content for publishing teams, host lore seminars, and participate in story rooms and creative sessions.<br />
The team has a language and pronunciation database for specific phrases and terms.<br />
During Wrath of the Lich King development, one of the writers asked how to pronounce &quot;Ak’agthshi ma uhnish, ak’uq shg’cul vwahuhn&quot;.<br />
It would have made sense for Krasus to be there for the Sinestra fight, but he had already died in a book, so the team had to come up with a new Red Dragon.<br />
Sometimes the team revises history, but only very sparingly and only as a last resort.<br />
Khadgar was much younger in the Warcraft movie than the team had imagined him being at that time. In The Burning Crusade he was much older and had a long grey beard, so the team went back and made a younger Khadgar model.<br />
Continuity exists to enhance a story, not to tie the hands of creators.<br />

Well the Alliance is a righteous and good faction with fitting storyline, unlike bloodthirsty Horde in the service of death whether it's Sylvanas or Loa of Death.<br />
<br />
So cinematic accordingly.</div></div><hr />

Khadgar appearing much older than he really was in the BC is explained in one of the novels. Seems the loremasters at Blizzard really don't know shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I... Ion knows that Khadgar was aged by Medivh during their encounter back in WC1 and that is why he was so old... right? Please tell me that Ion did not forget that very important lore fact and just make a change on a whim because &quot;Uh, Movie Khadgar was young!&quot;<br />
<br />
By all accounts our Khadgar should have been roughly that young in WC1 but because of Medivh's aging him into an old man that is why Khadgar looked so old.<br />
<br />
This really bothers me, this one comment by Ion bothers me GREATLY...<br />
<br />
And I know its a whole team behind this, but the fact that it was worded this way, and the track history of lore issues such as the famous Red Shirt Guy moment at Blizzcon really makes me think they completely forgot Khadgar's origin and instead of looking into it went &quot;Oh, hey, movie Khadgar is super young... why is ours so old? Lets tweak him a bit!&quot;<br />

<br />
If you don't mind that this isn't a 1:1:<br />
<br />
Rastakhan knows he needs someone / something powerful in his corner for the coming turmoil. Loa (Gods) of wind and rain and good harvest aren't going to cut it so he says he'll put Bwonsamdi (Death) above all the other gods in their religious heirarchy if he aids Rastakhan.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi likes this but oh wait, you're just one troll, eventually the people will want their gods of wind and rain and good harvest back, not a Death God.<br />
<br />
Rastakhan says not only will he honor the pact but his entire family bloodline - the ruling cast of Zandalar - will as well for as long as they exist, so there won't be any 'take-backs' of the oath just because Rastakhan will eventually die.<br />
<br />
Bwonsamdi agrees to that one, and now has a vested interest in the Empire of Rastakhan surviving because the bloodline and he are now linked.<br />
<br />
Is that helpful?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's kind of like a redemption arc for herself and an &quot;Oh, so we were wrong&quot; arc for the Kul'Tirans.<br />
<br />
The story they have is that Jaina all but stabbed Daelin in the back and not that she struggled to stop him the whole time and convince him of the potential error of his ways, and ran off and sapped the strength of Kul'Tiras when they needed it most, which is why she's immediately arrested and her mother disowns her on the spot.<br />
<br />
Katherine seeing all of the horrible stuff Jaina has tried to stop that led to her kind of going off the deep end for the bit was an eye opening moment of &quot;You know, my husband always was kind of a shithead.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a very emotional moment but you need to be more invested in the characters.</div></div><hr />

Do you really think you're important enough, to tell people what words to use?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
&quot;Continuity exists to enhance a story, not to tie the hands of creators&quot;. Well, that explains everything. Translation: &quot;Continuity is whatever we say it is, we'll retcon anything to make it fit the shape the game, at any given moment.&quot; For those that don't understand, continuity is the glue that holds a story together, it's the links from point a to point b to point c, that are consistent and logical. Things like &quot;Jaime lost a hand in the story at Point A, so we can't have him use his missing hand after point A.&quot; What Ion is saying is that glue, the consistency of the story, only &quot;enhances&quot; a story, and isn't a foundation of it - which makes any writer of any note laugh hysterically. According to him, the Death Star blowing up can be changed, if it makes Episode IX more entertaining. <br />
<br />
So, forget lore. To the game director, it's basically window dressing, that can be changed to make the developers job easier. Good to know, I won't waste money on WoW lore books anymore. <br />
<br />
I'm flabbergasted he would say something like that in public. Dude. Ion. Learn to shine your audience on a little, maintain the fiction that you give a flying fuck about lore. This is the kind of thing you keep to yourself, or only say at work. <br />
<br />
There must be some big ass retcons coming, if this is what's on his mind right now.</div></div><hr />

Fuck I wish my IRL friends were Horde instead, I've hated the switch for so long.<br />

Bwonsamdi's character is top notch and I hope to see more of him.</div></div><hr />

dear god the cringe.<br />
<br />
It’s a baby carrier. The target market isn’t edgy 14 year olds. It’s fine. Babies don’t have cringe.</div></div><hr />

Ion knows that Khadgar was aged by Medivh during their encounter back in WC1 and that is why he was so old... right? Please tell me that Ion did not forget that very important lore fact and just make a change on a whim because &quot;Uh, Movie Khadgar was young!&quot;<br />
<br />
By all accounts our Khadgar should have been roughly that young in WC1 but because of Medivh's aging him into an old man that is why Khadgar looked so old.<br />
<br />
This really bothers me, this one comment by Ion bothers me GREATLY...<br />
<br />
And I know its a whole team behind this, but the fact that it was worded this way, and the track history of lore issues such as the famous Red Shirt Guy moment at Blizzcon really makes me think they completely forgot Khadgar's origin and instead of looking into it went &quot;Oh, hey, movie Khadgar is super young... why is ours so old? Lets tweak him a bit!&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know man, that one line in the interview just rubs me all kinds of wrong ways :S<br />
<br />
I seriously don't know where to even start with that. I don't see why Khadgar in the movie would have effected how he is portrayed in the game even without the forced aging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Rhonin was coming to defend her city after she asked him to do so.<br />
Antonidas was defending his city and asking her to leave.</div></div><hr />
