Going to agree. I don't mind the reputation stuff and attunement-esque things to access them but making them mythic only and requiring pre-made groups is likely to piss a great many people off for no good reason. Dumb, dumb, dumb.</div></div><hr />

I honestly hope something wonky is up with the datamining. I haven't seen any destruction warlocks top meters anywhere, and yet nerfs to everything. Channel Demonfire, most useless 100 talent, nerfed as well. Crossing fingers for datamining gone wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't a reputation gate. It's a combination of quest/grinding mana crystal gate. People were waiting for 3+ hours and still never getting a healer due to the amount of time it takes to get that far. The level of progression in the zone required to unlock them is/was a bit much. I haven't ran CoS yet because of this. Arcway I got lucky and a healer happened to hit the quest at the same time as me. But, personally I wasn't overly impressed with the amount of trash in that dungeon. It was just unnecessarily long due to a ridiculous amount of trash mobs. It's actually the only dungeon that I haven't enjoyed so far.<br />
<br />
Face it, a lot of players are just going to hit max level and start farming for gear. While I think they're cheating themselves for what they are missing, it's just how it is.</div></div><hr />

its nothing but devs stupid pride - same as with those talent changes in ptr build - they just reiteraite stupid ideas instead admiting to fuck up and dont push something just for sake of pushing. <br />
<br />
my guess they are shit scared without those attuneemnts and requiring suramar for flying nobody will go there for story which raises the question why they even put it in there instead making it as 109-110 leveling zone. just for sake of fake &quot;content&quot; like tanaan ?</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of them as mythic only, it's not that hard to find 4 people for 2 dungeons maximum twice in your entire time playing legion. If you can't spend 10 mins looking for a group (less than queue times) then run a dungeon that only requires 10 ilvls more than heroic. I have to be honest i'm not sure how you do anything in WoW, not even to mention queue for a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason so many dislike being forced(forced if they want to experience all dungeons) make a premade group is because as soon as a premade group is required people expect everyone to play like mythic raiders that never screws up and can speed clear the dungeon. Also on my realm people won't ask for the minimum ilvl, but instead much higher than what is actually needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I thought it was a smart change too. A lot of people weren't happy with the way they were implemented before and this should return the epic factor to them. Its also really good that they made it so u didn't need to complete the dungeons to continue the story.<br />

yup after initial 2 weeks its gonna be &quot;lfm suramar dungeons 870 itlv or gtfo&quot; - sadly wows playerbase is way to toxic to behave like devs want them to.</div></div><hr />

This decision is kind of bold but it could be good for the game if they're willing to actually make some content require working for again. Seeing everything on easy mode in the first week and then being bored and quitting is one of the problems in the way things currently work in WoW for a lot of players.<br />
<br />
Artifact power change seems a bit arbitrary, guess they want it to &quot;sound&quot; more rewarding when you get an upgrade. As in, getting 250 points from a random dungeon sounds more exciting than getting 25 points. MMO-Champion have presented this really badly though, from a glance at the front page it looks like they just made artifact traits WAY WAY harder to obtain by... the graph is really misleading.</div></div><hr />

Probably one born out of you being here for years, yet seeming to hate every aspect and everyone. Why do you even play the game anymore Shudder? I don't think I've ever seen you say one even slightly positive thing. Obviously you're quite entitled to your own opinion, I just don't understand why you still play given how much you seem to dislike the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not entirely. Mythic dungeons are also intended as a progression path for people wo do not raid at all.<br />
<br />
While in WoD we have had the situation that you could overgear the instances to some degree with fully upgraded Tanaan epics and some loot from Kazzak, Mythics are a stepping stone after heroics. Mythic+ is the harder way, but the basic mythic dungeon should be accessible.<br />
<br />
Surely, there are people who are willing to take lower geared players along, but I usually only would do this with a guildie where I at least know the playing abilities. I wish, they would remove the gearscore an ban any person who tries to use some kind of addon for that. This was one of the good things of Classic and all expansions before GS came into play.</div></div><hr />

It's like people think they're playing a singleplayer game.<br />
<br />
It's not about finding a group. It's about finding a group with REASONABLE requirements in a REASONABLE time. I have yet to find a Mythic group in WoD despite spending several hours at a time on several different occasions sitting in a city LFG and watching for forming groups while combing through the Premade Group Finder. People either set the requirements too high (as has been noted above) or they paw through your achievement list and automatically dismiss you if you haven't accomplished one thing or another.<br />
<br />
The problem with &quot;Mythic-only&quot; requirements is that it only attracts a certain type of player and those players in general have NO patience for someone who does not have the experience--experience which they can't get because they can never get into a Mythic group--and they want to blow through those Mythics while being as overgeared as possible as a group so they can move on to the next thing.<br />
<br />
All this does is punish people who are not hardcore players, particularly given that profession quests, class hall quests and even the flight Meta achievement all required these two dungeons in some form or another. I believe a few of them have since been removed, but if they want these two dungeons to only hold any meaning for the &quot;elite&quot; players, then they'd better make sure all they're getting is higher ilvl gear or reskinned mounts--as always.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ejpaints</div><div class="date">2016-06-15, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same time. They buffed artifact acquisition rates as well. Items that were giving 20 Artifact Power are now awarding 250-300.<br />
<br />
There are still a lot of items still giving 10-20. I assume they haven't finished changing them, but nonetheless I went from only being about 500 AP till unlocking. Gold talent to needing another 6k to unlock a gold talent. I didn't run any dungeons last night as I was time crunched yesterday, but....<br />
<br />
Storyline quest rewards still gave 100 AP. (I've now finished all zones so I can't test this further without starting another character. Not sure if I'll do that yet.)<br />
<br />
Order hall mission reward went from 40 AP to 75 AP. <br />
<br />
World quest went from 40-60 AP to 200-350 AP. <br />
<br />
Treasure chest items remained at 5-10 AP. (I didn't come across any 20 AP ones last night.)<br />
<br />
I think that's all the ones I ran into yesterday. So while they buffed some significantly others barely changed. I assume they aren't done, or it's possible the change makes it so my beta toon is now pretty gimped bc I already completed all quests except for the Suramar line which I was stuck on a broken quest. Need to go back tonight and see if that one is fixed. If I make it through all that and AP gain still seems low I may start another character for comparison purposes. It feels like this change will be fine from the start, but doing it yesterday felt like a nerf on my character. (Mind you I don't say that as a complaint as I don't really care about my beta toon that will disappear in a couple months. I just hope they figure out their formula before live or a change like that will really upset people.)<br />
<br />
Also artifact research appears to be working for some but not others. Mine still didn't work last night but others claimed theirs was, so it would seem artifact knowledge is still a work in progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a tip, create your own group with people who didn't really do them or haven't done them already. Get the experience there and move up, yes you can't find groups that are head and shoulders above you in experience and gear but nothing stops you from creating your own group and most of the time you have plenty of geared folks around that will carry one or two people in the team. <br />
<br />
Another part is mythic dungeons right now don't award that much they aren't that lucrative to for a larger group of people.<br />
<br />
Anyway all i'm saying is stop making excuses why you can't and instead of waiting for something to be done for you, do something for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that addresses only the reasonable requirements, not the reasonable time frame - when the system (such as forming your own groups for mythic) allows for personal requirements by everyone who uses the system, then EVERYONE is going to have their own requirements, and regardless if you are forming your own group or not, unless YOUR requirements match the majority of EVERYONE else's, your wait time is going to be long - an auto grouping system removes this long wait time by ensuring universal requirements for everyone that uses the system</div></div><hr />

The mobility pretty much sucks and look at Warriors for a example, they have so much mobility and able to close gaps very easily, except against Fire mages for what I am told lol, but all other casters suck. Go into a battleground and what do I see, nothing but melee and on a rare occasion a caster. not sure if they are just focusing on melee at the moment and getting stuff worked out with them. I have played Beta for WOTLK and it was pretty awesome, but this one is not at all exciting, the servers are really lagging, choppy, and not very stable, yet again it is &quot;Beta&quot; but still who knows they could be testing the stability of the servers. Problem is just we don't know what is going on really.</div></div><hr />

Plenty of the people bitching about how the game &quot;isn't social&quot; and whining for attunements, don't accomplish anything in-game. They're not hardcore or casual, they're just whiners.<br />

Not season over.... The entire expansion. Seems silly to retire mounts forever!!!!!!!!! Lets be real for a moment. WoW PVP isn't exactly the greatest PVP experience on the market. Some people just don't enjoy it. I haven't enjoyed WoW PVP since Arena was put in the game. Before that time I was in back to back BG's almost all the time. I even got myself a few titles in Vanilla.<br />
<br />
I am simply asking for a way to get old no longer relevant to current content or current PVP standing mounts to be made obtainable in the following expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it really sucks you're not allowed to start your own group. Blizzard should change that and hand out more premade licenses...<br />
<br />
I've done this on Live. Ever since Mythic was a thing. I routinely up my ilvl through whatever alternative means I can and while I am LFG I will also try to set up a group myself...all for naught. We will get a group of 4 together and wait an hour for a healer or tank who wants to join a group of people who aren't already overleveling the content (and I'm sitting at around 700 ilvl right now--Mythic only drops 685, right?) and the group will end up disbanding after all of that time because nobody can be found for the 5th spot.<br />
<br />
And I'm not &quot;waiting for something to be done for me&quot;. I put in the work to reach an acceptable level for the content, but now I'm gated by completely arbitrary and frankly ludicrous secondary requirements. This has nothing to do with me wanting something for nothing or wanting something handed out to me. This is me actually working towards an in-game goal but being unable to reach it for reasons that are completely beyond my control. I have the same issue with Heroic Raid runs. I've yet to be able to get into a group--or successfully put one together--because a lot of the &quot;hardcore&quot; player set has this absurd mentality that if you're not already eclipsing the content you're worthless.<br />
<br />
I sincerely doubt I'm alone with this particular bit of frustration. In fact I know I'm not as I used to get several of the same people trying to form groups/raids with me during those times. But we always fell short of getting enough people, and we were always denied entry to other forming groups--mostly without any explanation.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I'll reiterate, if they want to make content like this super-secret-elite tier only, fine. But they'd better not gate class/profession/flight progression behind it if they don't want to have to backpedal on it later from the majority who will never see it.</div></div><hr />
