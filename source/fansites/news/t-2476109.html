<br />
Azerite Knowledge<br />
<br />
The Azerite Knowledge system that periodically reduces the Artifact Power required to level up the Heart of Azeroth has been extended to April 23.<br />
Developers’ notes: This change should give more players the opportunity to attain Azerite traits on current gear and reach the current maximum artifact level of 50 before the major Heart of Azeroth system update coming in Rise of Azshara. <br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Players will once again be able to share their in-game adventures on Twitter.<br />
