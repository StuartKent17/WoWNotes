Patch 4.2 - Heroic Item Upgrades<br />
The latest PTR build of Patch 4.2 finally allowed us to understand the use of the Crystallized Firestone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71617/crystallized-firestone/) dropped by all Firelands boss in heroic mode. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upgrade Weapons and Relics from the Patch 4.2 Valor Points Vendor (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2319-Patch-4.2-Valor-Points-Rewards-Firelands-Ragnaros-Video-Blue-Posts-Artworks) to heroic quality.<br />
Upgrade Weapons and armors from the Firelands raid to heroic quality. Since they aren't listed in the loot table of any boss I will assume they're trash loot but I could be wrong. <br />
<br />
<br />
To buy the upgraded version of an item, you will need the normal version of the item and 1 Crystallized Firestone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71617/crystallized-firestone/). <br />

At this point we're not really sure if it will be a Diablo 3 Collector pet or the pet given to people who will attend Blizzcon this year. <br />

Goblin Racial Nerf<br />
It wasn't a stealth nerf. It was a bug fix to make the goblin racial function as stated. This is the racial description:<br />
<br />
&quot;Always receive the best possible gold discount, regardless of faction.&quot;<br />
<br />
What this means is you will get the exalted discount from faction vendors regardless of your standing with that faction. There was a bug, however, which allowed the discount to go beyond the maximum (exalted) discount provided to all other races.<br />
<br />
We fixed the bug so that the goblin racial now functions as advertised. If you're friendly with, say Kirin Tor, you will receive the same discount as a tauren would who is exalted with that faction. If you're both exalted, you'll still receive the same discount.<br />
<br />
So it was previously stacking with other things, like the guild bonus and such? And now it's fixed?<br />
That's correct. <br />
<br />
This is hardly even a racial now. What does it give Goblins that everybody else doesn't have access to now? What other races have a racial that everybody else can be on-par with by putting in a little effort?<br />
<br />
Best Deals Anywhere explicitly states you get the best possible gold discount from vendors, not more of a discount than any other race can possibly get.<br />
<br />
We’re not trying to nerf fun here, but the goblin racial package is very powerful even if you ignore Best Deals Anywhere completely. It’s a fine line between making racials fun and interesting, and making players feel like they can only pick a certain race.

Leaving instances in combat<br />
I'd agree it can be annoying, and even costly, but I don't think a restriction of not allowing people to leave during combat would achieve much. Generally people leaving at those moments are doing so on some type of 'principle'. You're pulling too slow, the healer has a fishing pole equipped, etc. etc. and it would be just as productive for them to stand there doing nothing and either wiping the group or just making it a tougher pull. Unlikely they'd think &quot;Oh, I guess they really need me&quot; and jump into combat. They'd just wait until everyone died, feeling justified in their ability to kill the group, and then leave.<br />
<br />
There are also situations where being able to leave while in combat wouldn't be the 'wrong' thing to do. For example if someone decided to pull the instance in hopes of wiping everyone.

<br />
Today during PTR testing, Reckoning (US-Lightninghoof), Aptitude (US-Stormreaver), and Ascend (US-Dalaran) grouped and killed Ragnaros (25) as well.<br />
<br />
We didn't get the first half of the fight because nobody was running fraps, but we got the harder parts. The second intermission phase isn't working correctly, since there are supposed to be 2 Scions that spawn with 6-ish million HP that need to be burned down. We also didn't see the correct version of P3, where meteors are rolling around that need to be knocked back every 5 seconds by the raid member they fixate on. He had over 200 million HP and has a 10 minute enrage timer, which we hit on the previous pull.<br />
<br />
The fight concept is basically to spread out in P1 and deliberately trigger Magma Traps that Ragnaros throws down in a controlled fashion. If you don't trigger the traps, they don't despawn, and every time a trap is triggered the raid takes around 62,000 fire damage. He also will occasionally slam Sulfuras down onto the platform, killing anyone that gets hit by it and throwing out 3 lava waves (which were mostly invisible or bugged out in this version of the fight).<br />
<br />
The intermission phases have 8 Sons of Flame spawn and fixate on Ragnaros' hammer, and if they reach the hammer the raid takes around 100k fire damage. They move slower every 5% of their HP you reduce until they hit 50%. Our intermission phases were bugged, and you couldn't see the Sons of Flame unless you were within 10-15 yards of them, so we had to spread out around the hammer and kill them as they came within sight of the raid.<br />

Ragnaros on PTR is extremely buggy and he misses p3 entirely (atm he just copies p2) and during the second transition Scions didn't spawn, and they add some complications during that phase.</div></div><hr />

We would have liked to be able to test the meteors, but we didn't have them spawn (well most guilds didn't fight them tonight).

I don't think anyone cared when they realized ragnaros was bugged after testing 10 man version which had meteors because there were many guilds constantly hitting p3 and getting destroyed shortly after. P2 is nothing special.</div></div><hr />

I'm just saying, it's kind of redundant to make and release a 'kill vid' of a boss that is bugged removing the hardest mechanic. Kind of seems a bit counter-productive no? Not to mention misleading to others who don't know about the final phase and how it should be.<br />
<br />
And maybe most guilds wiped on transitions yes, but most 'top guilds'? No. If they had the meteors they very much spent the evening wiping on that I can assure you :P</div></div><hr />

I actually watched the ensidia stream after we killed him, and they kept wiping in P2 or hitting the enrage. And well we don't say it wasn't bugged or say how good we are for doing this, but nonetheless not many guilds downed him today, even when fighting the same &quot;bugged&quot; version. And it's better to have a vid available for a boss when you want to see it even if it's bugged rather than having no vid at all isn't it? :) And if i recall correctly there was a vid of a 40% wipe here on MMO before when Rag was available for 10 man testing, so why not post this?</div></div><hr />

This is so true. In the vid, the 2 big adds didnt even spawn so it is the same transition as p1-p2 and that is a lot easier compare to the real transition to p3. I watched Method steam lastnight and without the phase bug, and with many metoers, they got to 20%ish. That was the real nice work. <br />

So you have to progress backwards nowadays, interesting<br />

<br />
<br />
The Firestone only drops from Heroic encounter and I think the real purpose of the Firestone is to upgrade some certain slot that can't be upgraded by loots eg., thrown, relics, which can be purchase by using the Valor points. It will also adds more varieties to the gears choosing and some of those Valor gears are the BiS after upgraded with the Firestone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not only are Larger fire adds supposed to spawn during the Sons' phase after the initial transition but, a full 3rd phase is missing right now.<br />
<br />
In the last phase meteors chase people and more and more spawn so that people are not standing still to heal or dps causing a soft enrage. aka the hardest phase.</div></div><hr />

Imagine that you got access to Heroic content after the first week Firelands releases, you won't be going back to normal modes, how do you upgrade gear with this Firestone if you don't even got the gear to upgrade<br />
<br />
The firestone upgrades valor point loot and trash loot, both of which you can get if you do normal or heroic.</div></div><hr />

There was Grunty (StarCraft II Marine) from Blizzcon 2009, there was Deathy (Deathwing-like Murloc) from Blizzcon 2010, and this year it's looking like a Diablo pet.<br />
<br />
But wait, there's more!<br />
<br />
Remember the StarCraft II Collectors Edition pet for WoW? It was a Mini-Thor, looked nothing like a Murloc, I'm pretty sure for the Diablo III Collectors Edition pet they'll have a mini model of something actually from Diablo, not a murloc.</div></div><hr />

wtb some cloth spirit gear for healers. as it is one raid drop a helm.. thats it. and tier.<br />

compared to in cases 7 actual spirit leather/mail/plate gear... I see holy priests rolling on output gear soon.. or stacking whatever 372 they can get. pretty ugly, there isn't shit for heroic raid drop heroic. hell even regular raid drop spirit cloth. <br />
<br />
At least not yet.<br />
<br />
btw im' not basing this off of the current post solely either. Check wowhead if you don't believe me. we have zilch for spirit cloth aka priests on the PTR yet. (crafted and rep items i'm not counting, as those aren't progressional gear)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah at least the topic should have mentioned something about the &quot;bugs&quot; in addition to just &quot;Ragnaros Kill Video&quot;. The vid missed almost half of the fight, which are the most difficult parts of the fight and might lead many people to a wrong conclusion/idea about the fight. And of course the uplader of the vid on youtube also mentioned nothing about the bug. Not to discredit or having any bad intension here but at least as an uploader you should mention the bugs so people will know that the real fight is not this simple p1 then p2 then p2 again. They didnt claim about the kill but imo leaving zero information about the HUGE bugs also imply about the kill credit too.<br />
<br />
And because of this I really understand why Rag said &quot;You have come too soon&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Anyway. I approve of the upgrade system for trash and vendor items. So long as they go Soulbound after the upgrade. I mean right now, how many people feel a bit cheated that their Relics or awesome Trinket can't be upgraded to heroic, while other classes get their cake? A few, I imagine. Now with the upgrade system for heroic bosses...oh yes. Very nice indeed.</div></div><hr />

You cant kill him on normal mode, you can only beat him.<br />
<br />
Heroic Ragnoros is a modified encounter where you can truly kill him.<br />

We are a raid guild mate, that's what we do. If we have an opportunity to learn a boss fight in advance, we do it. Also that's like saying &quot;don't read the journal&quot; so you don't know what the boss mechanics are. I know the encounters are easy, I hope it's because they are under-tuned.</div></div><hr />

From that i understand the upgrades will be for vendor and trash drop items you dint need to go on normal to get some nasty BoE you can have it from trash on your usual heroic run.Also most likely upgrade versions will become BoP so you wont take the stone with your main and give the imba weapon on your alt.And 3th now we have 13 bosses 12 for normal but in firelands they will be 7 so with that blizz want to remove a part of RNG in loot and compensate us for missing 6 bosses</div></div><hr />

With all the complaints of the top raiders, if I were Blizzard I would test mechanics on very undertuned bosses, in different phases, mix heroic and normal skills and never show the full thing on the ptr. I don't know if it's done that way, but some issues on the ptr indicate it.</div></div><hr />
