<br />
From what it says it might increase your damage done by 10% at all times along with the effect it currently has<br />
<br />
So speccing into it:<br />
<br />
1) You get the whole beast within thing<br />
2) You get a permanent 10% damage increase</div></div><hr />

I guess the 10% over all *might* be better in the end, but come on, this is a rather rotten thing to do. <br />

Might be better? An extra 8 seconds is nothing compared to 10% more over all damage. It is better. I don't feel like doig the math but cool downs normally don't scale extremely well for actual dps where as over all 10% more damage scales pretty freaking well.<br />
<br />
In the long run, its a pvp nerf and a pve buff all in the same change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't understand what the issue is. They don't want to buff SPs too much because then DoTs will be crazy. So what, just buff Mind Flay or Mind Blast then. Buffing our single target spells will improve our standings tenfold.</div></div><hr />

Here is the issue plain and simple. No two classes whine more than mages and warlocks (well maybe rogues), but the second shadow priests can do the same damage if not (SHOCK) more damage than a mage or a warlock Blizzard will be spammed with &quot;but I'm a pure dps&quot; all over their forums and they don't really want to deal with it. Shadow priests are supposed to be a hybrid, and Blizzard strings them along as &quot;playable&quot; although the majority of the population thinks shadow priests should just respec healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Its actually a good change. You see the problem with typhoon is its a front assault cone aoe. The problem with frontal assault cone aoes is when they have insane range you have to be really careful using them in tight corners. The reason to dump the knock back in the first place (by glyphing) is to get rid of the issues of dealing in cramped corners, so making it a 20 yard range wasn't going to help that whole close quarters thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's NOT a god-damn nerf, read the talent properly before you start commenting. You gain 10% damage at ALL times when specced into this talent, and when you use Bestial Wrath, you gain an ADDITIONAL 10%</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're not asking for the same or more. Just competitive. Full BiS gear spreadsheets show Warlocks doing over 2,000 more single-target DPS than Shadow Priests. That gap isn't something you can just ignore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StitchMonkey</div><div class="date">2009-09-09, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might be better?

<br />
<br />
And the more I think about it the more i do feel that yes it likely will be number wise better. (but keep in mind, when you spec right, you get BW down to a cool down of just a little over 1 minute, so yeah you can be in it a lot) <br />
<br />
But at the same time is sucks because, again, I *like* the spell and I like the effect, shortening it just seems sad somehow. I think would have preferred the duration stay the same but the bonus go down. <br />
<br />
I was hoping that they would add some sort of defensive bonus for the pet in with it. They keep talking about survivability. Give the pet some healing and a defense bonus to BW, helps keep them alive. And a good BM could even weave it in so as to pop BW when an AOE or other pet killer is about to hit. <br />
<br />
Beyond that. So what does Beast Within really do for the hunter? We glow red for 10 seconds and get a 20% mana discount? Yes the 10% all the time is nice, but it just feels week somehow now. Do we get an extra 10% during Beast Within on top of it all the time? Come to think of it, maybe Beast Within would be the place to stick the defensive bonus. . . . then there would be some point to us glowing red for 10 seconds. <br />
<br />
If nothing else it will ease the damage ratio back to the hunter over the pet. That will at least make a pet death less painful, and may make others scoff less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ITS A PVE BUFF!! If its a constant 10% damage increase then the only place this is nerfed at all is that you won't have reduced spell cost for 8 seconds, but in change you get a constant 10% damage increase instead of and 18 second 10% damage increase on a 2 minute timer.</div></div><hr />

If nothing else it will ease the damage ratio back to the hunter over the pet. That will at least make a pet death less painful, and may make others scoff less. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From what it says on the talent calculator at the moment, yes</div></div><hr />

well looking at the talent calc it lists all the tree specific CD's as being 1 min (vamp blood unbreakable arm and bone shield)<br />
but i can see no mention of that anyway in any patch notes, still if thats right and it makes some sense that our 4 part bonus got halved if the cd got halved then its nice return of useable cd's</div></div><hr />

But is that based on testing, or based on text? <br />
<br />
It seems kinda an odd talent to basically &quot;give a 10% damage increase overall plus 10% damage increase while in this form for 10 seconds&quot; Just seems awkward. <br />
<br />
Plus is that a 20% during Beast Within or 10% on top of the 10%? Yes they are different. <br />
<br />
I guess I am just cynical. I am not a fan of the change so I am distrustful of Bliz as to how clear the intent is. <br />
<br />
I suppose some tanks will like the shorter big glowing red pet time at least. Maybe at least BM's will not be so hated now. Even that would be a nice buff.</div></div><hr />

These are the first real patch notes. They have no real mention of item changes in them at all. Itemization is always the last thing that gets added to the patch notes. The vast majority of that is because they have to balance the classes before they introduce item changes.<br />
<br />
I'm personally confuzled. I could have sworn we were already playing 3.2. So, how can these be patch notes for 3.2? Are these actually patch notes for 3.2.2?</div></div><hr />

No two classes whine more than mages and warlocks (well maybe rogues), but the second shadow priests can do the same damage if not (SHOCK) more damage than a mage or a warlock Blizzard will be spammed with &quot;but I'm a pure dps&quot; all over their forums and they don't really want to deal with it. Shadow priests are supposed to be a hybrid, and Blizzard strings them along as &quot;playable&quot; although the majority of the population thinks shadow priests should just respec healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, bad players who happen to play pure DPS classes would whine but they would whine regardless and Blizzard knows this.<br />
<br />
Shadow Priests need buffs as do half the &quot;DPS&quot; specs in the game. Unfortunately, IMO the currently under performing DPS specs are SOL for the rest of wrath and really should just respec/reroll to something that's not hip-deep in UP powers until Cataclysm hits.<br />
<br />
With the introduction of Masteries Blizzard has painted themselves into a corner where spec performance is concerned and will be forced to review/overhaul every class in the game.<br />
<br />
I'd leave the UP specs where they were unless there was an easy tweak we could use to console them here or there until it was time to actually review them too. If you've got to do the dirty deed eventually, might as well try to do it right once. There's no real reason to spend the manpower to do the (in some cases extremely low level and intensive) changes necessary to balance some of these specs when you'd just have to do them again in a few months.</div></div><hr />

Didn't know about that, but it must be something seriously wrong with the setbonus since 99% of all Rogues keep their 4-set bonus from t8 since it weights out the stat increase from ilvl 232 and 245 of what I've read around Rogue forums and such.<br />

Not to nit pick, but you mean frost DW tanks get a nice boost, and I'm not sure how many people have come accustomed to DW tanking.

At the time, BM was doing ungodly damage. Now, its dragging in damage. Its not that they did to much damage back then its just that they did more damage than everything else.

How do you see that its useless? All the abilities are going back to 1 minute timers (down from 2 minutes). Sure, they are getting balanced a little. Here is the little problem with shield block tanking. SHIELD BLOCK DOES NOTHING TO PREVENT MAGICAL DAMAGE! Seeing the vast majority of bosses in Uld and TOC have a crap load of magical damage you want a tank that can take that damage. That normally leaves you with two options. You can either go druid (because they still have the highest possible health pool even after the paladin buffs and still have the second highest damage reduction) or DKS that now have the second highest hit point pool and the highest possible reduction (which actually gets buffed due to changes to frost presence and being able to chain cool downs).</div></div><hr />

While this is funny, the biggest reason people hate pet classes is umm the pet. BM chooses to forgo personal dps to add pet dps. Of course they are going to be hated. The only reason they weren't hated in TBC and early wrath is because they did insanely more dps than the other specs. Until that happens again people will still want MM or Surv simply because they don't like watching someones dps drop by 1000 or more every time their pet dies, and we all know pets LOVE dieing.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why. Its a good thing when flame shock critical strikes. What you mean is that you have a new set bonus. Don't think for a second Blizzard isn't going to change the set bonus. They just don't know what they are going to change it to yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I think BM needs a signature PET move rather than a shot. That is the point of BM. And if done well it could both equalize the DPS and add some thought and strategy. Plus give a feeling of controlling your pet. . . rather than letting an AI do it. I would actually like it if the pet did a higher percent of damage, but was more controlled and dictated by the human player.</div></div><hr />

I agree completely, its more a commentary on how Blizz will cause a blanket nerf to all 3 specs, while overlooking another way to nerf a class that is so dominant.<br />
<br />
Just think if they hadn't nerfed SS to begin with. Would MM and Survival needed as much buffing if they hadn't touched SS and nerfed BM elsewhere? I've never liked the way Blizz does heavy handed nerfs, especially one that effects all trees, only to wind up buffing those things after awhile because &quot;Oop's we were too heavy handed.&quot;<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean BM didn't need a nerf when it was op, or that Volley needed a nerf back in 3.0 too. In fact when i saw what Volley was doing in Hyjal trash after 3.0, i knew it was going to get nerfed, it was just way too OP. But nerfing SS wasn't the answer to the other classes whoa's, and they had to go through other routes to buff those classes, and now here we see them &quot;almost&quot; rebuffing SS in the BM tree only, because they realized that their heavy handed nerfs went too far in that tree.<br />
<br />
Longer story short, I laugh at how blizz will do a sweeping nerf, killing many talents at once, instead of a gradual tuning by trying this first, and then adding that. They just do it all, and then do gradual rebuilds. You think PTR's would allow for the gradual nerf method so they could avoid having to do the patch by patch gradual buffing instead.<br />

And part of being a good BM is pet management. If you pet is getting spanked you call it back and cast a mend. It is not that hard to keep a pet alive. Ok in some battles it is hard to keep a pet alive and keep them in the battle (safety dance anyone) but I can still keep them alive. <br />
<br />
I play sitting next to a healer, in the same room. Even he rarely has to comment on my pet's health, and usually when he does a mend is already ticking.</div></div><hr />

Check the talent calculator. <br />
<br />
No, you are wrong, because constant abilities (even lesser ones) that buff your health or lower your damage taken are much more important than a cool down that wears off after 18 seconds on a 2 minute cool down. Having almost constant damage reduction is much better than having damage reduction for only 18 seconds unless the boss hits less often but really hard. That isn't really the case with bosses in Uld and TOC. They hit very hard very often, so being able to constantly avoid/mitigate/overcome that is much better than popping something for 18 seconds and then being healed like crazy for the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
Besides, the only change at all was to the unbreakable armor glyph (armor by 20% instead of damage absorbed by 20%). Also, unbreakable armor was buffed to give 25% armor but nerfed to give 10% strength (less avoidance from parry and less threat but more mitigation). All of the other abilities just had their duration shortened, which makes complete sense when you look at a 1 minute cool down as compared to a two minute cool down.<br />
<br />
If anything, DKS will probably end up coming out ahead, but then again Blizzard always manages to pull them ahead somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't do heavy handed nerfs. You want to see heavy handed nerfs go play WAR, UO or DAoC. Mythic/EA does heavy handed nerfs. When they nerf an &quot;overpowered&quot; class/spec that class/spec becomes unplayable (and they rarely buff it back to being playable).</div></div><hr />

If you pet is getting spanked you call it back and cast a mend. It is not that hard to keep a pet alive. Ok in some battles it is hard to keep a pet alive and keep them in the battle (safety dance anyone) but I can still keep them alive. <br />
<br />
<br />
You do realize that when you have to call your pet back and cast mend you not only are wasting a gcd (hurting your personal dps that way) but you are also taking half your dps off the mob until its healed back up again. Given the choice between having a throw away pet and still doing insane dps or managing a pet to allow me to do insane dps having to heal my dps every time it takes damage I think I'd have to stick with doing insane dps. That is why I avoid pet classes. I think that is why the vast majority of people don't like pet classes in this game.</div></div><hr />

1. People who LIKE playing BM <br />
2. People that don't have a chance to Raid often enough to make it needed<br />
3. People who are in a guild of friends and not controlling overlords. Who let people play a game and do not worry about &quot;allowing&quot; people to play in a way that is enjoyable. Heck my guild only has 5 level 80s but we are RL friends (My other half has know the GL for like 15 years) It is what it is. . .. i could never leave them. . . .but no I do not get to raid as much. <br />
<br />
Not everyone is in a die hard crazy guild that is all about the best of the best. Not all of us have the time or the opportunity or the connections. If I could raid regularly and saw that my spec was a issue I'd look at changing it. But when i mostly only get to to 5 mans with friends I'll stay where I am happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That 11,000 dps was from fan of knives and a special buff given in the fight. Rogues are still not topping charts reliably outside of gimic fights. Don't try to throw out gimic fight statistics and say rogues are over powered. People don't like rogues, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve to scale well in all of their abilities. Besides, rogues have dominated dps in this game for 5 years, do you honest expect that to stop now? The down side is, well you have to play a rogue, that is enough of a downside for more than half the player community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is a trade off and a balancing act. Calling the pet back does decrease DPS but not a GCD, and healing it is better than ressing it. <br />
<br />
You can like what you like. I started playing largely because I like the pet aspect. When I have had the rare chance to raid, I am near the top in DPS and usually only out DPSed by people way over geared to me. Heck i have managed to out DPS SV and MM hunters in better gear than me. <br />
<br />
I said it is part of management, and sometimes a small DPS sacrifice is worth it to keep the pet alive.</div></div><hr />

While I sort of agree with you, don't be surprised when you see all of those abilities go the way that DK abilities just went. I wouldn't be shocked at all to see all of the immune and damage absorption abilities get a shorter duration with a shorter cool down.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd almost be willing to wager that shield wall and divine protection end up on 1 minute timers with their duration being about 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, all the dps abilities were BUFFED not nerfed. The only thing really changed was unbreakable armor to give 50% more armor at the cost of 20% absorption (granted a decent sized nerf for reducing magical damage) and a bunch of duration nerfs. The duration nerfs are because all of the timers on death knight damage reduction cool downs are going back to ONE MINUTE. In the end, this will actually end up being better not worse for dks.</div></div><hr />

Combustion got broken when they introduced the living bomb glyph. They stated they have been working on this for awhile. This is an interesting solution. Either way, I think you missed something with the forums. The fact that every class is broke according to every class and every OTHER class is also over powered according to every OTHER class. True story.<br />
<br />
Also Shadow Priests have 0 reason to complain as there DPS is rediculously OP at the moment. Here is the proof<br />

<br />
<br />
NO! First of all, you have to glyph it then and you screw over all your other glyphs (you already have a set three). Second of all, it still doesn't benefit from storm strike and even the crits on the dot won't over do what earth shock does when its damage is buffed by storm strike. Third of all, they just buffed enhancement shamans by giving them a mob swing speed push back. This might not have been needed, and most likely will not stack with other such affects, but now if your tank is a warrior and you don't have any other form of push back the warrior doesn't need to worry about thunder clap.</div></div><hr />

And on top of that, 11k is only hit when using FoK in a fight with adds, which if I recall is being nerfed as well. They are just making Envenom scale better, that's not going to make a massive difference in dps.

<br />
I'm a BMer, always have been and am fully aware of the class mechanics and how ArP stacked MM dominates, but its a personal ingame choice to stay BM and wait it out til Blizz brings it back into season.<br />
<br />
I do suggest a few things tho to bring BM back to raid-life tho, bugger off the 10% overall damage, thats cheap. Bring in a reasonable Agility &amp; Haste scaling to pet exclusive to the upper BM teir, maybe inplace of spirit Bond, or In the BWithin slot Merged to Bwrath and slot in the Scaling talent. Then as an enhancement in the pet talents, re-design and bump up cobra reflexes a couple of teirs to increase the amount of haste scaled. <br />
<br />
I mean Haste is great, but we may as well put the puppy fat to better use seeing as we're at the soft cap already as BM.<br />
<br />
Just thinking aloud ;)<br />

Oh well, anyway, ever since the BM mega-rape-nerf that destroyed the spec I went on hiatus, if we can get another PvE buff to maybe, I dunno, put us back in competing DPS with Marks/Survival, I would return.<br />

Glyph of Typhoon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/62135/) - Reduces the cost of your Typhoon spell by 8% and increases its radius by 10 yards, but it no longer knocks enemies back. (Down from 20 yards)<br />

So first they nerf the shit out of typhoon, then they nerf a totaly useless glyph in to completely useless trash, the logic behind the typhoon changes is just awesome.</div></div><hr />

Most ppl noticed BM burst downgrade. Now add totem-of-freedom nerf to a pile and here you go. It would seem like arms-enh-holy can prove more viable now (note that I am 0% PvP dude and I understand that my no one really cares about my PoV).<br />
<br />
That was fast.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Also I don't really understand why it was nesessary (spelling?) to make those flame shock and lava burst changes. Probably to give Ele another glyph slot as they can't keep up due to high end scaling (note also that I am nowhere near to end content, though I can read parses).</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Increases all damage you deal by 10% and while your pet is under the effects of Bestial Wrath, you also go into a rage causing 10% additional damage and reducing mana costs of all spells by 20% for 10 sec. While enraged, you do not feel pity or remorse or fear and you cannot be stopped unless killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that 35-40% of the total damage done by a BM comes from the pet. This 10% buff applies to the damage done by the hunter ONLY.<br />
So don't except to see Recount show you a straight up 10% increase in your total DPS because of this buff. It will be more like a 5% - 6.5% increase.</div></div><hr />

Now if u have a talent point there, u will cause 10% more dmg all the time! and when u active BW it will be + 10%= 20%<br />

ofc no need to say this buff is amazing for pve... (get ready for a BM invasion)Assuming a 50/50 split of pet DPS and master DPS, this works out to a 1.5% increase in overall DPS. As the pet's DPS goes up versus the master's, the benefit goes down.<br />

NOW on the current patch its a 50/50 u r right ok.. but on 3.2.2 its gonna be something like 65/35 calculating all the changes<br />

<br />
Assuming a BM Hunter doing 6000 DPS before BW and a 50/50 split (so 3k each):<br />
<br />
3000 * [1 + (0.10 * .257)] = 3077.1 DPS from Hunter<br />
3000 * [1 + (0.50 * .257)] = 3385.5 DPS from Pet<br />
Ratio: 48% Hunter, 52% Pet<br />
<br />
With the new changes:<br />
<br />
3000 * 1.1 * [1 + (0.10 * .143)] = 3347.19 DPS from Hunter<br />
3000 * [1 + (0.50 * .143)] = 3214.5 DPS from Pet<br />
Ratio: 51% Hunter, 49% Pet<br />

I also think the change to Frost Presence and Unbreakable Armor are changes Death Knights deserve after all the nerfs. Sure the amount of Strength increase is lower, but for tanking, being able to increase your armor by 25% (45% with the glyph) is amazing. I do however think that the glyph should also increase your Strength by an additional 5-10%, but oke. Tanking as Blood at the moment, but these changes could very well let me respec to Frost. A total of 10% damage reduction while in Frost Presence!<br />
<br />
I hate the change to Vampiric Blood. A total of 10 seconds where you increase your health by 15% and your healing received by 35%... Almost seems like a waste of a talent point now.<br />

Check the new talent calculator. Cooldown's also reduced back to one minute. This is a massive buff to the actual usefulness of this as a tanksave, means I can have it up for every ''Surge of Darkness' Esque ability again. I cheered.</div></div><hr />

I also think the change to Frost Presence and Unbreakable Armor are changes Death Knights deserve after all the nerfs. Sure the amount of Strength increase is lower, but for tanking, being able to increase your armor by 25% (45% with the glyph) is amazing. I do however think that the glyph should also increase your Strength by an additional 5-10%, but oke. Tanking as Blood at the moment, but these changes could very well let me respec to Frost. A total of 10% damage reduction while in Frost Presence!<br />

One thing I don't understand is the tier 9 4set bonus. It was already crap, but 10 seconds? Who would want that? Atleast include Icebound Fortitude in it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you're overlooking the fact that they're cutting the base cooldown of those abilities in half. I imagine 20s duration with 1m cooldown would just have them nerf it again like they did the first time. Same with the t9 4set bonus, -20s off a 1m cooldown is too much. Turning a 1m cooldown into 50s is absolutely still worth it for tanking.</div></div><hr />

No, it's still doable with 2. It's harder on the healers, but it's very doable with 2 tanks.<br />

It's pretty funny. The version of Earthen Power they're proposing to change to was its original form in Beta. Nobody, and I mean nobody, specced into because it was trash. This change will clear up some clutter in the enhancement tree, as now there's no need to worry about how you're going to fit Earthen Power into your build.</div></div><hr />

Its a good thing when flame shock critical strikes. What you mean is that you have a new set bonus. Don't think for a second Blizzard isn't going to change the set bonus. They just don't know what they are going to change it to yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer you (and the earlier poster) they did change T8 set bonus. *It now reads:<br />
<br />
&quot;You get to replace glyph of flamestrike with glyph of lava, giving you both better raid PvE dps and better PvP burst. *In addition, once you upgrade and lose the T8 set, you still get to keep glyph of lava instead of flamestrike because it will still do more sustained PvE DPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
Er, I think that's what it said, I'm doing this from memory so I may not have gotten the wording exactly right.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: *I really have no clue if lava will out DPS critting flame shocks in the future. *Don't hold me to that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was because of the really sucky set bonusses of tier 9,.Tier 8 bonuses were an immense and significant change and to ele set bonuses that most were almost unwilling to sort of downgrade to tier 9<br />
<br />
<br />
/wave fellow llaner.<br />
<br />
The T8 bonuses are uninspiring at best. Electrified has been around 2% of my total DPS. Lava Burst hovers around ~18-20%. The 20% damage boost it will be more than the T8 bonus, even discounting the stat increases.</div></div><hr />

And yes it's a nerf for PVP - but only in so much that you now need to pop it APPROPRIATELY, instead of just whenever the hell you feel like it. But it also makes Hunter more bursty - which is very nice indeed - they might finally be doing competitive damage when you just NEED to get that healer down.<br />
<br />
It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silarn</div><div class="date">2009-09-10, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunter math:<br />
<br />
Per cooldown, your pet will only get 55.6% of the bonus damage it used to. Because of the permanent damage bonus, hunter damage during this cooldown actually ends up being 11% better than what it used to be (although relatively speaking the hunter's damage increase over normal damage is still reduced due to the duration nerf).<br />
<br />
That makes it equivalent to a 27.5% damage buff (22.5% less) over 18 seconds for the pet and a 11.1% buff (1.1% more) to the hunter's damage. Meaning ultimately this is a 21.4% nerf to the COOLDOWN damage. This damage boost is active roughly 1/12, or 8.3%, of the fight, resulting in a 1.8% damage loss looking purely at damage numbers during the cooldown. I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing from a PvE perspective, as BM burst DPS was some of the best in the game. (It's just the non-burst damage that falls short.)<br />
<br />
However, the hunter gets 10% more damage at all times. Assuming a 50/50 split (and I would guess that the hunter actually does a bit higher percentage than that in reality), that is a 5% increase in DPS. Which means, assuming the hunter only does HALF the damage pre-change, this is a 3.2% overall buff. The higher the actual % of DPS a hunter does, the greater this buff will be.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Just looking at some reports and spreadsheets, damage may actually be about 50/50. So I would expect this to be a roughly 3.2% buff, as stated. -- Actually, once you get even beggining CC-level gear, hunter DPS quickly outstrips pet DPS, making this buff a little closer to 4%.</div></div><hr />

Nevermind.. this sucks, Typhoon would have been a very powerful spell. Now the glyph will only be used vs melee due to its very short range (10 yards) and glyphing (+10 yards) will remove the knockback. <br />

The signature of BM is... what else, Bestial Wrath... Now instead of it having a more of an &quot;impact&quot; effect, there is a lazy 10% added...

Now what about PVP? Well, one dead spec there... Beastcleave showed it can win against RMP, and we can't have that hapening! Quickly, destroy BM for PVP!!!<br />

Since the nerf patch, I've struggled as a Tank in heroic TOC. I'm as geared as you can get for that place, and basically have to hold my breath and blow every cooldown to stay alive.
