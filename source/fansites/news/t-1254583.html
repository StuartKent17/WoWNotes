Coming to the PTR in the near future will be a new designation of item type in Normal and Heroic raids for non-tier pieces. Each 5.2 raid boss will have a chance of dropping this new designation of a particular item that’s 6 item levels higher than their counterparts. These higher quality versions will be called “Thunderforged”. This means that there will be five variations of some items. You’ll now see a 5.2 raid item of LFR quality at item level 502, the same item in Normal quality at item level 522, the item in Normal Thunderforged quality at item level 528, the Heroic version of the item at level 535, and the Heroic Thunderforged version of the item at level 541.<br />
<br />
This new item designation is being added for a couple reasons, but first and foremost to make loot drops more interesting overall, especially after you have earlier bosses in Throne of Thunder on farm. As you’re working on progression, those first few bosses can now continue to provide a chance at upgrades, making repeated kills potentially more exciting and rewarding. Those additional upgrades can then help to slowly raise power, and boost you over whatever progression roadblock you may hit.<br />
<br />
We’ve also received a lot of feedback regarding 25-player raids, and have been looking for ways to address some concerns. Ever since we changed 10-player raids to drop the same item level as 25s, we’ve seen a steady decline in 25-player raiding. This isn’t surprising. A 25-player raid takes an extra level of logistical commitment for the officers of those groups. It’s unfortunately easy for a 25-player guild to collapse down into a 10-player guild, but very unlikely for the opposite to happen. However, we like 25-player raiding and don’t want to see it go away. Like many players, we love the epic feeling that comes with banding together more massive groups to battle powerful foes, we love that there’s opportunity for those groups to try out new players or unusual comps without causing a huge burden, and we want to support the larger raiding guilds. That said, we’re also concerned that over-rewarding the 25-player guilds—if, for example, we went back to a higher item level across the board for 25s, as was the case for Icecrown Citadel—would feel like a slap in the face to the many 10-player raiders out there, who are the majority of our Normal and Heroic raiders.<br />
<br />
To attempt to navigate this minefield, we’re going to try having Thunderforged items drop more frequently in 25-player raids. They’ll be somewhat rare in both cases compared to the standard versions that’ll drop, but they’ll be even rarer in 10s. Overall, a 25-player group will be more likely to end up with a slightly higher item level after several weeks of raiding.<br />
<br />
It’s important to keep in mind that this only affects 10- and 25-player Normal and Heroic raids, and tier-15 armor pieces won’t be available in Thunderforged quality at all. We’re curious to hear your thoughts about these changes, and what you think once you begin seeing them on the PTR.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moveth</div><div class="date">2013-01-23, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a really nice way to go about the 10/25 logistic dilemma. Im assumine that each piece of loot that drops will only have a 1-2% chance of being Thunderforged (Since there are so many bosses). So this is just a nice way to still have pieces to get while we farm the content we have already cleared.<br />
<br />
Also the fact that its available on both difficulties with a slightly higher chance on 25 means that no one is left out and people who raid 25 can still feel special. :P</div></div><hr />

Total &amp; Utter Bullshit.<br />

I'm a 10 Man Raider, and I see no reason to be annoyed by any of this. This gives very little incentive to be in 25 Man, but that is all it needed, just a small nudge, nothing major! This is perfect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's entirely possible some of the playerbase will overreact and move from 10s to 25s again out of a thought of being left in the dust if they don't, but we'll see.</div></div><hr />

We told you that 25's would die out when you made the loot the same, and it happened. When will you listen to us players instead of sitting in your ivory towers and chatting amongst yourselves??<br />

<br />
This is what I am concerned about. <br />
<br />
Was it not just a few days ago with the PvP change that a blue said they have trouble balancing the gaps in gear level between pvp and pve. So they were going to introduce more tiers of pvp gear to equal the amount of different levels of pve gear. Then they add more levels of pve gear..?<br />
<br />
I don't geddit.<br />
<br />
I'm not against the change, just don't like how many different levels of gear there are in the game.</div></div><hr />

What is the % chance of having an item roll 'thunderforged'? The statement that over the course of a few weeks this will contribute to a 25 man raid having a slight ilvl advantage would suggest that 25 mans should expect around 1 such item per boss. Will you be able to get thunderforged items from using your extra loot roll? If you can, will you have a better chance at getting the item to roll thunderforged on your extra roll in 25 man? <br />
<br />
I doubt they will put a hardcore gear wall in place, but I suppose if they did have something that required say full heroic gear (the heroic only boss?) this might effect the progression race</div></div><hr />

I went the whole DS without my Kiril dropping and then on the last week of raiding, when it was useless, it dropped, I've cleared ToeS almost every week so far and am yet to see my staff from Tsulong. Instead of making more quality of items, why are they not fixing this problem? it just seems like they are not complicating things more then is needed.<br />

oh wait raiding hero since weak1 since it was available , some items NEVER DROPED not even 1 time.. and now giving them even more loot easyer? nah sounds like a realy bad thing..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
its like DS i raided HC EVRY WEEK evry boss... at the end of the content i was missin 1 item for my BiS Gear... thanks to that now 10 man raids will never get BiS gear... at thats what some poeple are aiming for.. i know its not important to have it but hell its what makes &quot;ME&quot; and surely many others grind raids for a minimal motivatition or satisfaction ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also adding MORE RNG to the game? That is the last thing we need. This is going to cause some guilds to get geared up much more quickly by getting lucky with the new thunderforged drops while some guilds will never see any or see very few due to bad luck. This is just like legendaries such as warglaves. Some guilds get 20 of them while others get 0 during the entire expansion........ which is not fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of hardcore progression raiders (myself included) enjoy eventually getting their full BiS set at some point during that tier (sometimes on multiple characters). Once your full BiS is achieved (along with most of your other guildies) it allows you to take a break from raiding and still be ready at the best possible advantage for the next tier of content (every previous piece of gear from a tier matters when going for top world/region/server rankings). With this implementation it is VERY VERY VERY unlikely for even ONE person (minus maybe a tank) to ever reach a full BiS set now. Under the assumption a full BiS set would be your best itemized pieces thunderforged. I feel top guilds are going to feel it necessary to raid every single week (probably multiple 25 mans) from the start of one tier until the start of the other because there is ALWAYS going to be that possible thunderforged upgrade for them off a boss. Which could result in a MASSIVE burn out of top tier players because they don't get the break in between tiers that they are used to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this any different from having to kill H LK for months so that everyone in the raid can get the mount? The argument that you are going to make the hardest of the hardcore raiders burn out because you make them... raid, is somewhat silly. Apparently you also make hardcore raiders burn out if you make a tier last too long or be too challenging, because then you just have top end guilds raiding like maniacs for weeks on end like in tier 11. I think that when you decide to be a hardcore raider you know what you are signing up for.</div></div><hr />

This dude serious? The drop rate is only going to be slightly different. Probably on par with the amount of Tier Pieces that drop in 10 v 25. You're going to change the landscape of your guild because of an RNG item that you can get in 10 man also?</div></div><hr />

They should be trying to find ways to make them easier to organize on the leaders, or find ways to reward the leaders more during the raid. Being a peon dps in a 25M raid is probably easier than being a peon dps in a 10man. There especially is no reason to reward 25M peons over 10M leaders. It is probably drastically more work to be a 10M leader than a 25M peon.<br />
<br />
That aside.. this accomplish nothing. This is not enough to keep 25Ms who were close to falling apart from falling apart. It also is not going to make any 10Ms decide to jump to 25Mans.<br />
<br />
A better solution. Allow the 25M raid to designate 4 leaders. Those leaders then get 2 personal bonus loot roles each week. This rewards the 25M players who are actually doing all the extra work, AND it may be enough to tempt some 10M leaders to try to jump up to 25M.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It already takes much more skill for a 10M to be world first because of the raid comp restrictions and less gear drops, so now it will be even more sweet when Paragon still destroys these 25's again :)</div></div><hr />

The argument that you are going to make the hardest of the hardcore raiders burn out because you make them... raid, is somewhat silly. Apparently you also make hardcore raiders burn out if you make a tier last too long or be too challenging, because then you just have top end guilds raiding like maniacs for weeks on end like in tier 11. I think that when you decide to be a hardcore raider you know what you are signing up for.<br />
<br />
It is not even close to the same. With the mount example it will take 25 kills total (including first kill) to get the mount to every main raider (assuming you have 25 main and rest as spare). However to get the Thunderforge which in this case means Best In Slot you don't have a guaranteed drop rate for each kill so you might not even get it on those 25 kills at all. That said there is also the argument about RNG and Thunderforged pieces you already got drops so it takes ever longer. So even at a 50% drop rate, and I assume only one of these pieces can drop at a time it would take over 50 kills to get full Best In Slow for all raiders.</div></div><hr />

They should be trying to find ways to make them easier to organize on the leaders, or find ways to reward the leaders more during the raid. Being a peon dps in a 25M raid is probably easier than being a peon dps in a 10man. There especially is no reason to reward 25M peons over 10M leaders. It is probably drastically more work to be a 10M leader than a 25M peon.<br />
<br />
That aside.. this accomplish nothing. This is not enough to keep 25Ms who were close to falling apart from falling apart. It also is not going to make any 10Ms decide to jump to 25Mans.<br />
<br />
A better solution. Allow the 25M raid to designate 4 leaders. Those leaders then get 2 personal bonus loot roles each week. This rewards the 25M players who are actually doing all the extra work, AND it may be enough to tempt some 10M leaders to try to jump up to 25M.<br />
<br />
<br />
lol.<br />
you obviously don't raid 25man. <br />

plus your solution would have no impact / benefit since raider would just designate as leader the person that needs loot the most, nullying your brilliant theory that 25 man is only harder for 4 people in the raid.</div></div><hr />

Fact of the matter - 25 man content is now dropping more loot and better loot. It will make the overall progression of every character faster and easier.<br />
<br />
10 man content is now harder cause players will have lower ilvl than those in 25 mans. So now the real question is... are you a player ? or are you a leech? Join the right group size accordingly.</div></div><hr />

That means we're starting an expansion with 5 man gear that's 463 and ending with raid gear that's either 548 or 554 depending on whether they account for Thunderforge or not. Heroic tier 16 will be 561 or 567 respectively or higher if they do elite mode again.<br />

PPL are not interested in 25 for many reasons. Things like Frames per second change depending on how many players are taking part. And not all WOW players have best PCs around.<br />
<br />
I've played both 10 and 25 man. Maintaining a solid 10 man team is no easier than 25 mans . Just because 25 mans can split up into 2X10 mans does not tell you the fact about all the 10 mans raids that never get started because 1 person is missing - or not the right classes or the roles are logged on. <br />

Personally I dont bother doing either now. BLizzard has failed on so many levels with this expansion and these ilvl changes is just one extra feature that makes it even less interesting.</div></div><hr />

It gave casual raid groups the opportunity to extend lookouts without having discussions and finally tackle the final boss or some heroic mode they did not get to.<br />
It allowed people to ignore valor cap for weeks on end, because those points where only good to sell boe's with plummeting prices.<br />

MoP overall forces people to think where to invest time, especially if said time is limited. If you feel like having to do everything, say hello to burnout. Not only reputation moves from dailies to raids with 5.3</div></div><hr />

You really think it is harder to be a joe blow mage dps with no leadership responsibilities in a 25M than it is to be a raid leader of a 10M? The actual difficulties of 10M and 25M can be argued back and forth, but the devs have stated many times, and anyone can see that the REAL difficulty is with ORGANIZING of 25ms.. not with the actual encounters.<br />
<br />
Of course, the main tank will probably always be marked as a leader, but after that raids are not going to simply reward their lowest ilvl player extra rolls. One or two of the designations might be fudged, but the real leaders will get the designations most of the time... and if they don´t, it will be their choice NOT to get them since they are the leader. The raid leader can say. Ok, the two tanks get the designation, John gets the designation because he coordinated a lot this week etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of hardcore progression raiders (myself included) enjoy eventually getting their full BiS set at some point during that tier (sometimes on multiple characters). Once your full BiS is achieved (along with most of your other guildies) it allows you to take a break from raiding and still be ready at the best possible advantage for the next tier of content (every previous piece of gear from a tier matters when going for top world/region/server rankings). With this implementation it is VERY VERY VERY unlikely for even ONE person (minus maybe a tank) to ever reach a full BiS set now. Under the assumption a full BiS set would be your best itemized pieces thunderforged. I feel top guilds are going to feel it necessary to raid every single week (probably multiple 25 mans) from the start of one tier until the start of the other because there is ALWAYS going to be that possible thunderforged upgrade for them off a boss. Which could result in a MASSIVE burn out of top tier players because they don't get the break in between tiers that they are used to.<br />
<br />
Getting full BIS will be nearly impossible now, as it was in 5.0 with item upgrades. <br />
<br />
I say it will require a change of mind, in a sense that you don't really NEED to be full full Elite, you may stop at full heroic.</div></div><hr />

really simple fix and fair was to check for the guild rank (gm and officer) and check how much days there are gm/officers (they have the code to check that)<br />

be on a 25 guild and officer/raid leader and then you have the right to ask more than 10 man<br />

Liking the idea, disliking the fact that 10-man raiders get fucked over.<br />
<br />
You're not. This is actually a pretty brilliant solution. Unlike 25's dropping higher ilvls 100% of the time, which is sort of screwing over 10-mans, they're just going to get these new boosted items a little more frequently than you. However, every 10 man guild still has the chance to fully equip their raid in thunderforged items. That's the key here. Now, 25-mans will take more patience and perseverance to organize their raids, like they always have, while 10-mans will take more patience and perseverance to get the boosted loot, which is their tradeoff for having a raid that's easier to form and lead. As an officer, I would still rather do 10-man, but at least now there's a real incentive to put up with the hassle of organizing 150% more people, beyond the glorious image of a huge mob beating the shit out of each boss.</div></div><hr />

Actually im not much of a clueless retard, ive been raidleading on every boss on both 10, 25 and 40 man since late Vanilla.<br />
<br />
Ambershaper is probably abit harder on 10 man yea, but the rest? not at all, if i should mention 1 more it would be Warmaster in DS.<br />

I find it funny that u listed Stone guards more than anything, 3 bosses instead of 4 ? lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have a HIGHER CHANCE for TR gear to drop, but doesn't mean they don't drop in 10man, and you know how RNG works, A with higher chance doesn't always means he gets more than B who has a lower chance.<br />
<br />
I would have against it if it is a fix ilvl increase, or get something that you just cannot get in 10man, but I am OK with them have a slightly higher chance, just like now it is more likely for them to get gear that isn't going to get DE'd or goes to OS (hence more actual upgrades).<br />
<br />
Since 10man can still obtain these TR amours, I am OK with it.</div></div><hr />

We'll have to wait and see the actual odds to see how it actually works out. <br />
<br />
I think a 25% chance per item in 10 and a 35% chance per item in 25 would be ok. That would be on average 0-1 thunderforged items per boss in 10 and about 2 items in 25.</div></div><hr />

If blizzard really wanted to help 25mans out more when honestly one of the hardest things about 25m over 10m is their recruiting, then they'd figure out a better system to recruit. The recruitment forums are a fricking nightmare. Come up with a new system there and I think that would make so many 10 and 25m guilds so much happier. People really should decide to raid with a 25m over a 10m for more reasons than just loot. I dunno, I just don't think this is a real solution at all.</div></div><hr />

Even supercasual guilds felt nudged in the 25 direction - the fact of the matter is that 10man today is more popular. Period. I get it, I loved 25, it was awesome. But it was awesome while it lasted. I love my 10man guild, I love I can progress with it, despite the drawbacks (RNG on loot, mostly - an advantage 25 already has).<br />
<br />
I don't see why anyone wants to cling on ye olde ways. If you love 25 that much, you can 25 - if you don't, well, you don't. Why should 25 have extra rewards beyond what already exists to begin with?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think this is the proper incentive for 25 mans. They should be rewarded better. I wasn't playing during ICC, but the community really dropped the ball there it seems like. I'm in a 10 man guild and in no way, shape or form do I think having MUCH better incentives for 25 man is a 'bad' thing, that somehow will hurt my experience of raiding. <br />
<br />
You guys done goofed man, and the result is the decline of 25s... Blizzard looks like they have no idea how to fix the problem, on top of that. What is the thinking behind this? Omg let's all disband our 10s and go to 25s because there's a MORE THAN SLIGHT chance that the items drops are thunderforged? This is not realistic and thus not a proper incentive to maintain 25 mans.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think the concept is flawed from the start. You can't cater to two types of raiding almost equally when the effort to maintain one is much higher than the other.</div></div><hr />

You must be stupid. Stone guards means you have 1 less ability to deal with, less damage going out, and makes juggling the energy meters on the dogs much more simple. In heroic it's even easier, hell you get a 1/4 chance to dodge a mechanic that is annoying to deal with since jade is just ae raid damage<br />
Garalon is much easier on 10m, the damage requirement is much lower and theirs less raid damage, on top of the kiting situation being much easier.<br />
Ambershaper This is fight is probably the same on 10 and 25, constructs are the same, monstrosity has less life so stacking the debuff is easier, also explosions mean less people to top off.<br />
Shekzeer. Only 1 person gets visions in 10man, I don't see how that makes it harder, with only one person to dispel, losing people being feared out is not that big of an issue. Also ads don't even need to be prisoned because of their low total health, they can actually be tanked next to shekzeer since there is only one ad phase.<br />
Protectors is not harder, its on par for elite and normal. The only real qustionable fight would be tsulong, and thats solely on the day phase where ad management and assignments require raiders to rotate more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So 10m is harder because you have to get 10 skilled people together with the right composition?... ok... so when it requires you get 2.5x the number of skilled people together then it suddenly gets much easier of course. I don't see the logic.<br />
<br />
Earth to funny guy:<br />
10M is harder. Period. You need the skill level of each player in the 10M to be significantly higher than the average skill level in a 25M just because of all the advantages you gain. Not even having to worry about the raid buffs because you will always have every buff and debuff as a natural product of 25. 10M you actually have to craft your composition instead of throwing a bunch of driveling RANDOS together.<br />
<br />
You get more gear in 25, 8 more pieces per week for 16 bosses (or did they already raise it to 16?).<br />
You have the ability to carry a bunch of weaker DPS in 25, in 10 you might be able to carry 1.<br />
You can class stack in 25M, not an option in 10M.<br />
<br />
Name the advantages to 10M over 25M.<br />

<br />
Something drastic would have to happen for things to change, not soft changes. 10-man guilds already have a gear disadvantage compared to 25-man guilds, and that hasn't stopped them from being overwhelmingly more popular. And this is just another slight gear disadvantage, not even as big as the existing one. Perhaps if the drop was almost guaranteed in 25-man and rare in 10-man. But still. It seems like not a satisfying insentive.</div></div><hr />

Try doing that on 25man garalon prenerf.<br />
<br />
We had 6 people on average 200k dps for the full 6min fight and the rest at 80k and we did not kill garalon. We also had healers kiting pheromones to give ranged dps more standing dps. Also stacked 6 shamans for six stormlash, and 4 warriors for a 4 crit banner rotation. We had to clear on 10 so we could work on progression for wind lord.

How are they getting fucked over? 10 man raiders are still getting a chance at Thunderforged items, they'll just drop less frequently. I only raid LFR for now but I'm not jumping out going &quot;BAWWWWWL LFR RAIDERS GET BENT OVER&quot;. <br />

<br />
stone guards for 25man you can just ignore all the mechanics by healing through it. cant do that on 10man. im talking about when heroic msv first came out. <br />
garalon i agree except no the kiting situation isnt easier since in 10man, everyone has to kite, healers need to kite twice.<br />
ambershaper is the same for both sizes.<br />
shekzeer 2 people get visions, not 1. in 10man you need 4 healers. definitely harder on 10man.<br />
tsulong i agree that it can/cannot be harder than 25man.<br />
sha of fear is harder on 10man as well. in 25man you have 2 dps in the back passing the football, and you have enough healers/cooldowns to heal through the huddle. in 10man you have to pass the football to every huddle or else its a wipe since most often than not, 1 of the 2 healers gets huddled.<br />
the problem with 25man and 10man besides the fact that you can carry less than stellar players in 25man more than 10(not talking about the best guilds in the world since everyone has to be amazing), is that 25man always has enough cooldowns where you can heal thru mechanics. picked up a player from a top 25man and when he would die to mechanics his excuse would be &quot;oh we just always healed through it&quot;</div></div><hr />

Also the fact that its available on both difficulties with a slightly higher chance on 25 means that no one is left out and people who raid 25 can still feel special. :P<br />

10 men means 2 healers. less people = moar rng = 1 healer in the construct the other stunned = construct on the mage or shaman = goodbye bl on last phase.<br />

<br />
2 people get visions. Get your facts straight before talking about what you don't know shit. Adds need to get prisoned because if you have only an adds phase it means you have 3 healers and you can't heal phase 3 with adds going on shit on the tanks with their posion breath.<br />
<br />
Protectors is not harder, its on par for elite and normal. <br />
Protector is easier in heroic in 25, the boss do the same casts and you have more interrupts. World firts blood legion did it with their frapser dpsing the wrong target for over a minute. You can't even possible think about doing this in 10 men.</div></div><hr />

I am interested to see what the drop rate is does add yet another layer of complexity e.g. Thuderforged Sha Touched Weapons (if we get new Sha Touched weapons in 5.2) but hey lets see how it goes!<br />

garalon i agree except no the kiting situation isnt easier since in 10man, everyone has to kite, healers need to kite twice.<br />
ambershaper is the same for both sizes.<br />
shekzeer 2 people get visions, not 1. in 10man you need 4 healers. definitely harder on 10man.<br />
tsulong i agree that it can/cannot be harder than 25man.<br />
sha of fear is harder on 10man as well. in 25man you have 2 dps in the back passing the football, and you have enough healers/cooldowns to heal through the huddle. in 10man you have to pass the football to every huddle or else its a wipe since most often than not, 1 of the 2 healers gets huddled.<br />
the problem with 25man and 10man besides the fact that you can carry less than stellar players in 25man more than 10(not talking about the best guilds in the world since everyone has to be amazing), is that 25man always has enough cooldowns where you can heal thru mechanics. picked up a player from a top 25man and when he would die to mechanics his excuse would be &quot;oh we just always healed through it&quot;<br />
<br />
THIS FUCKING GUY<br />
<br />
You are literally stupid, You can not heal through chains breaking in non jasper phase with out the use of healing cooldown on the duo of downs. You will go oom if people stand in pools and colbalt mines. Please stop your words are so asinine it hurts to read.<br />
Garalon is less of dps race and more execution based, hell you can nine man only in msv epics and heroic blues.<br />
2 people visions over 4, also transition burst damage coupled with a sonic disruptions is deadly, whereas in 10man those literally do not do nearly as high percentage of health and easier to recover from. Also sorry you don't have resto shamans. In our 10m we could two heal it with a holy and resto shaman.<br />
Sha of Fear? Lol no, your not forced to bring 4 tanks because some of your dps is lack luster, especially with the fear the idiots can't kill their platform and return. Sure theres a chance only non retards will be sent but why risk the wipe when your dps cant pick up orbs or kill the ad in a timely manner. And no you can't heal through anything. Like dps getting gibbed in blade lord, more melee getting trapped in windlord, more risk of dieing to wind bombs because more people susceptible to lag spikes during phase 2 of windlord. Just stop this is a losing argument adn you know it.</div></div><hr />

10M is harder. Period. You need the skill level of each player in the 10M to be significantly higher than the average skill level in a 25M just because of all the advantages you gain. Not even having to worry about the raid buffs because you will always have every buff and debuff as a natural product of 25. 10M you actually have to craft your composition instead of throwing a bunch of driveling RANDOS together.<br />
<br />
You get more gear in 25, 8 more pieces per week for 16 bosses.<br />
You have the ability to carry a bunch of weaker DPS in 25, in 10 you might be able to carry 1.<br />
You can class stack in 25M, not an option in 10M.<br />
<br />
Name the advantages to 10M over 25M.<br />
I can think of 2, attendance and less crybabies.<br />
<br />
Myth Busted.<br />
<br />
Space, easier tactical management for 10 man. No crybabies in 25m, not sure what guilds you were in. Attendance, how does that fit in? You don't usually need to class stack in 10 man, it's still shit to need to class stack in 25, not all guilds have everyone have alts of all classes. For the guilds that class stack in 25, at the same level, 10 man guilds will also class stack.<br />
You get 6 loot in 25.<br />
<br />
Doing 10 man HC just feels simpler, not easier just simpler.<br />
<br />
And this new change by Blizz is worthless. Once people stop whining and think about it they'll figure out that neither 10 or 25 man will get full thunderfogged gear by the end of a normal tier so at most it will be 1-2 ilvl difference. That makes it not that bad but ultimately worthless for keeping 25 man alive.<br />
<br />
Just give separate achis or something, extra loot without ilvl difference is just not enough to keep me in 25.</div></div><hr />

10 men means 2 healers. less people = moar rng = 1 healer in the construct the other stunned = construct on the mage or shaman = goodbye bl on last phase.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2 people get visions. Get your facts straight before talking about what you don't know shit. Adds need to get prisoned because if you have only an adds phase it means you have 3 healers and you can't heal phase 3 with adds going on shit on the tanks with their posion breath.<br />
<br />
Protector is easier in heroic in 25, the boss do the same casts and you have more interrupts. World firts blood legion did it with their frapser dpsing the wrong target for over a minute. You can't even possible think about doing this in 10 men.<br />
<br />
Garalon's pheromone does less damage in 10man, you can stack it to LITERALLY 25-26 when 25mans are passing at 15-16 during progression kills. Why? because those 10 extra stacks are still manageable on 10 people whereas 25 is just literally too low with an incoming crush.<br />
Lets not mention progression feng kills where 2 people get arc resonance and if your raid is retarded they literally wipe a raid, whereas in 10man you can soak a tick or two from one resonance going off in a stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I do understand that some people will say, &quot;25 man raiding is a personal decision. Why should people who choose 10 man raiding not get the same benefits? If people want to do 25 man raiding, they should just accept all of that extra work as part of the gig and stop whining for benefits.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason I think Blizzard needs to reward the extra effort is (regardless of anyone's feelings/leanings towards 25 vs 10) that there is a distinct difference in the atmosphere and community created in a 25 man raiding team vs a 10 man raiding team. Blizzard realizes that the ease of running a 10 man raiding guild out weighs the benefits of running a 25 man raiding guild and that a large percentage of 25 man raiding guilds have died since the switch. Blizzard does not want to lose 25 man raiding guilds because of the type of atmosphere and community they create.<br />
<br />
If 25 man raiding guilds go extinct WoW so will that atmosphere and community and Blizzard will probably lose a vast majority of players who enjoy that. It makes good business sense to find a way to reward extra effort. I am not sure I like this idea but I am happy Blizzard is looking to reward the extra time spent running a 25 man raiding guild so that they do not disappear. They just have to find that perfect balance and, unfortunately, I do not think we will ever agree on a middle ground. This is the internetz, let's not forget. :)</div></div><hr />

I am fine with that. I've raided 25, and I understand.<br />
<br />
What this doesn't address - is the issue of loot drop disparity in a 10 man setting. Having distributed loot in a 10 man environment all through Cata, and now MoP - the issue we have always run into is too many repeat items that get DE'd - or repeat tokens that we don't need.<br />
<br />
My raiders want their full BiS gear just as much as anyone in a 25 man does. They are willing to work for it - and they do.<br />
<br />
Given that both 10 and 25 have the exact same loot table size (number of items available) - in a 10 man, you are presented with 2 items off that loot table.<br />
<br />
In practice, what we saw in Cata is we full cleared (farmed) Heroic Dragon Soul every week from March 15th (10% nerf) through Sept 18th.<br />
<br />
That's six months of farming - and our raid couldn't get full BiS.<br />
<br />
We are up against the same issue now - only we are under the gun of gearing up the best we can as we are presented with new content.<br />
<br />
So, Blizzard - what do you think is a reasonable amount of time for a 10 man raid to full clear heroic content, and gear up a raid in full BiS?<br />
<br />
The feedback of my raiders (we have all raided 25s historically), is that 25s already have incentive with more opportunity at gear upgrades - because 25s have more drops (read more %chance) in 25. Evidence, by the lesser world ranked raids on our server were able to gear up faster in their 25 man once the nerfs rolled in. I am not debating their access to the drops at end of the expansion. I am saying that their rate of gearing over two or three months seemed disparaging compared to our time spent raiding/progressing.<br />
<br />
My feedback, and input, is that I understand (and have experienced) what it takes to keep recruitment up to keep a 25 man progression raid going - I have done it. And while I like the idea of random Thunderforged items - I would like to see in addition that 10 mans are given an extra % chance for a third item to drop from the loot table. Is it 25% chance? 40% chance? I don't know.<br />
<br />
But we need something to help us get over the hump of repeated item drops that get DEd.<br />
<br />
I get that there will always be RNG, and that is a part of the game. But my gut feeling is - I should be able to completely gear my raiders with the gear they want after 6 months of farming content.<br />
<br />
Please consider.</div></div><hr />

This. all 25 players who say 25 man is harder than 10 man. They used the upgrade mechanic to avoid nerfing raids, now they just give it to 25 man and make it so much easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have a HIGHER CHANCE for TR gear to drop, but doesn't mean they don't drop in 10man, and you know how RNG works, A with higher chance doesn't always means he gets more than B who has a lower chance.<br />
<br />
I would have against it if it is a fix ilvl increase, or get something that you just cannot get in 10man, but I am OK with them have a slightly higher chance, just like now it is more likely for them to get gear that isn't going to get DE'd or goes to OS (hence more actual upgrades).<br />
<br />
Since 10man can still obtain these TR amours, I am OK with it.<br />
<br />
The RNG is already bigger in 10 mans based on simple numbers of classes and specs in the raid. Now you might have a thunderforged item dropping in 10 man that noone in the raid needs or can use to keep the progression going for that team. It will yet again create more frustration for players.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't hurt 10man groups, and has a little change of rewarding 25man groups. I am happy.<br />
<br />
Except for the fact where they will tune heroic modes to take Thunderforges into consideration meaning 25 mans will have a strong advantage. Given, we don't know the numbers, but if it's greater than 10% it's utterly moronic.<br />
<br />
So yeah, to all of you who don't understand progression, go read the raid tuning blog and you'll understand how if they tune their content with these weapons in mind and 10 player raids see less of these items then 10 player raids are getting screwed.</div></div><hr />

They have to scale it differently because of the ilvl upgrade system. We are still months away from 5.2 and alot of the 496 gear will be 502 by then. <br />
<br />
Not that I like the Ilvl system at all. It does more bad than good for the game in my opinion. Including more stat inflation, bigger gaps between best and the rest based on gear and the worst.. pushing more players to just play one spec on a multispec classes.</div></div><hr />

And some people seem to be overthinking the problems that go with it - it won't cause major ilvl inflation, because the thunderforged items aren't an extra tier really, theyre more of a half tier. look at the gap in ilvls between normal and hc on the current tier. and guilds shouldn't feel compeleed to farm thunderforged gear, unless the drop rate is quite high, simply because it would be quicker to start farming the hc gear as soon as they're able, its merely a perk</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having lead a 40 man, 25 man and 10 man raiding guilds I feel this is a totally wrong headed way to try to fix an imaginary problem. If you want a solution, Blizzard, then have one raid size of 15 players. It would be the least disruptive thing you have done to raiding in the past two expansions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torm</div><div class="date">2013-01-23, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well all depends on the drop chances. If you consider, the similar drop rate means that when 2 players in 10-man raid get Thunderforged items, then 5 players should have it on 25-man (well should use 1:2.5, but I don't want to split a raider in half). If the chance to get Thunderforged item in 25-man raid will be higher (considering for example 2x higher -&gt; 1:5 instead of 1:2.5) then it might be worth and it will help progress 25-man raiding much faster and usually closer to the level of 10-man raiding guilds (considering 10-mans are usually easier).</div></div><hr />

As with Heroic raiders being forced to do Normal for the first week, if you've done no Heroic raiding in the previous tier you're being &quot;forced&quot; to do LFR until you hit 502.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 man content will be balanced for higher ilvls so progression will be slower for 10 mans. Best players might deal with it - but most will not. That leads to more and more ppl not bothering with raiding at all and then BLizzard needs to find real solution to the issues. <br />
<br />
The CORE of MMORPG game is to create a system that makes good and solid progression for MAJORITY of the players. Not just few. Any system that starts to reward some players over others for playing the same content is therefor - just gamebreaking. This system will not help that majority at all. It does exactly the opposite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To really change something, you'd need to convince a guild like mine to make an attempt to convert or merge to a 25 heroic guild (we used to run an offday 25man semi-pug back in ICC, and I had an alt in a 25man 'progression' heroic group, but since lockouts became exclusive, I can count on two hands the number of 25man normal or heroic raids I've participated in). I'd be for giving it a go personally, but it would have to be a pretty big change to convince the rest of my group, a change that would definitely upset more 10man raiders than they're prepared to. Realistically for many of us, unless they put it back at a whole 'tier' difference again, we're going to stay with a better, easier to organize, smaller group than going to the trouble of finding 20 more people who can do decent numbers while paying attention to mechanics. I know my job personally would be easier in a 25, in most circumstances, but I'm not in charge.<br />
<br />
It's a bone to the 25mans, it's fine with me. Not going to make 25s make a big comeback or anything, and hopefully the effect will be more mollification than feeding of their superiority complex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And WTF is with all these different tiers of loot within the same tier?!?!?!<br />
<br />
LFR mode, LFR pro mode, Normal mode, Thunderforged Normal mode, Advanced Normal Challenge mode, Heroic mode, Thunderforged Heroic mode, Heroic Elite mode, Super Sayan over 9000 heroic tantric mode.<br />
<br />
No wonder there's so much number inflation in this game. And to think that there used to only be one type of gear that dropped for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Stone guards means you have 1 less ability to deal with, less damage going out, and makes juggling the energy meters on the dogs much more simple. In heroic it's even easier, hell you get a 1/4 chance to dodge a mechanic that is annoying to deal with since jade is just ae raid damage<br />
Garalon is much easier on 10m, the damage requirement is much lower and theirs less raid damage, on top of the kiting situation being much easier.<br />
Ambershaper This is fight is probably the same on 10 and 25, constructs are the same, monstrosity has less life so stacking the debuff is easier, also explosions mean less people to top off.<br />
Shekzeer. Only 1 person gets visions in 10man, I don't see how that makes it harder, with only one person to dispel, losing people being feared out is not that big of an issue. Also ads don't even need to be prisoned because of their low total health, they can actually be tanked next to shekzeer since there is only one ad phase.<br />
Protectors is not harder, its on par for elite and normal. The only real qustionable fight would be tsulong, and thats solely on the day phase where ad management and assignments require raiders to rotate more.<br />
<br />
Only one person gets visions of demise in 10m? Yea you definitely know what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />

So now 25 man raids not only drop more loot PER PERSON in the raid, but also drop more extra special loot PER PERSON...all because the officers have to do a little more work.<br />
<br />
Having lead a 40 man, 25 man and 10 man raiding guilds I feel this is a totally wrong headed way to try to fix an imaginary problem. If you want a solution, Blizzard, then have one raid size of 15 players. It would be the least disruptive thing you have done to raiding in the past two expansions.<br />
<br />
Try leading a 25man progression raid on a dead realm, and then come to me. Even in the worst of times you can cobble together 10 people, but on dead server, where realm forum activity in the last month has been nothing more than bump posts to recruitment threads of 2 raiding guilds one bieng 25m and the other being 10m that disbanded a week earlier, and you'd change your tune. Back in WOTLK and CATA we could keep our standard were they have been since the beginning of BC but now we've lowered our standards just so we can get back ups and fill the raid properly even with an 80% attendance requirement.</div></div><hr />

Holy shit, why are you 10mans so bitchy, not only are all fights tuned for 10man, you still have to whine and moan about 25mans being more difficult. Seriously since everything is unique equipped I don't see how your states is really any more relevant to the dps check that was garalon. Not to mention the top tier dps need to carry on garalon (rogues and warriors) up till then had shit optimized gear, well rogues are a different story but at least for warriors, with out proper trinkets this tier carrying was much harder/ is harder.<br />
<br />
Im not saying one is harder than the other. I think both are almost the same some harder on 10 some on 25 man. But what i said about the upgrade system is true and now 25 man gets upgraded gear (thunderforged gear is upgraded normal/heroic gear ) more faster than 10 man meaning that 25 man will get higher ilvl then 10 man. Assuming both are almost equal in difficulty and hc ist tuned for non-thunderforged gear i feel betrayed that 25 man is getting &quot;nerfed&quot; once 5.2 comes out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Porcell</div><div class="date">2013-01-23, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, my first thought was &quot;Our poor, poor DKP system.&quot; We already have a bad time dealing with 489 vs 496 vs 502 vs 509. We have our raid members pay for each item slot once, per difficulty. So if I get a 489 helm out of MV and pay DKP for it, then I can get a 496 helm out of HoF for &quot;free&quot; assuming there isn't someone else paying for it. So yeah, this can lead to people &quot;holding out&quot; and not taking upgrades because the want first-shot at that 496 &quot;real upgrade&quot; and not the interim piece.<br />
<br />
Now we are going to have random half-steps dropping too? So the first person, with highest DKP, gets their 522 item, then next week the Thunderforged 528 item drops; what happens? It's not really fair to charge the first person full DKP again. Charge him an upgrade fee? Someone who doesn't have a 522 items needs to pay full price + upgrade fee to get it?<br />
<br />
What a freakin' hassle. I personally don't care about loot much at all, I'll get it when I get it. I've never horded DKP to hold out on a specific item; if someone drops and is an upgrade I say &quot;Want&quot; and if I have highest priority then I take it. But some people aren't like that, and all they are doing here is introducing more drama. Just keep the Valor Upgrade dudes in there if you want people to bump item levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have a HIGHER CHANCE for TR gear to drop, but doesn't mean they don't drop in 10man, and you know how RNG works, A with higher chance doesn't always means he gets more than B who has a lower chance.<br />
<br />
I would have against it if it is a fix ilvl increase, or get something that you just cannot get in 10man, but I am OK with them have a slightly higher chance, just like now it is more likely for them to get gear that isn't going to get DE'd or goes to OS (hence more actual upgrades).<br />
<br />
Since 10man can still obtain these TR amours, I am OK with it.<br />
<br />
I don´t think most people think it is a horrible idea as much as it is just a meaningless addition that will accomplish nothing. 25Ms already have a slight gear advantage ( average number of drops per player).. this will just add a tiny bit more onto that in a different mechanism. They could have just as easily bumped the rate of drops a little higher for 25M.. it would mean the same thing...25Ms will gear slightly faster than 10Ms<br />
<br />
But neither change is going to keep 25Ms from falling apart. It is just a new, complex system added for no real benefit. Do you really think if a guild is on the verge of collapsing to 10M that the guildleader can say ´but the RNG chance you get a thunder-forged item is less in 10Ms´ and that will do anything to sway people?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In his defense.. stone guard WAS easier in 25 than 10 until they hotfixed it a couple of weeks later.<br />
<br />
What makes 25 probably easier than 25, is that it gives you tons of versatility. I remember when my guild was working on Nefarian 25 man, I went protection so we could have an extra raid cooldown for crackles. In 10 man swapping an extra healer has a lot more impact than on 25 on your dps, same goes for extra tanks.. not counting the many more raid cooldowns, 3 battle rez.. and obviously, you nerf the encounters faster since you get more gear faster.<br />
<br />
While the only thing that would make 10 man easier is the fact there are less people to manage.<br />
<br />
But obviously system is not perfect, so we have fights where 10 is easier and some where 25 is easier right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? If you can organize a raid, then do it and get the real gear. If you cannot, then just run LFR and get upgrades. If you cannot run regular raids, then you still have progression gear through LFR, and that is the goal.. all players can progress their gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thats just a side effect, but good luck trying to carry 3 mouth breather DPS in a 10man thats 60% of your DPS having there thumbs up you know what. That same 3 dps in 25man LFR is only 17% of your raid. Sure it will hurt you but get serious here if you cant compensate for 3 slackers in the undertuned LFR you have more issues as well. But try to compensate for 60% of all dps spots being waste yeah thats the reason my friend.</div></div><hr />

its litearlly 1 piece of loot more, the only thing it solves is rng, and even then it can be god awful considering class stacks. I've cleared Sha of Fear for literally a month and a half and last week was the first time a sword dropped, we have 5 dps warriors, a prot tank, and a pally tank, think about it.

That was one of my thoughts also. The real difficulty with 25Ms is organization. With this change, they are adding a ton of annoyance on the loot distribution of the guild... ie.. the raid-leaders are now going to have even MORE of a headache.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it was because the majority of people never got to see raid content beyond the first few bosses in a tier because they were in a small guild, or their guild just couldn't handle the logistics of 25 man raid organizing, and people wanted more small group content. Blizzard's solution was to make 10 and 25 man versions of each raid, and it was a good idea, except at first 10 main raiding was not at all rewarding. Then they made 10s and 25s drop the same gear, which probably wasn't the best idea because 25m raiding doesn't offer enough to make it worth doing for a lot of people. At points in time both groups of raiders have been correct in being unhappy with the situation. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure this latest idea will &quot;fix&quot; the problem, but we'll just have to see.</div></div><hr />

The guilds knows who there organizers are have the guild reimburse them for the &quot;extra work&quot; really give them 1000g a week for running 2 raid nights a week if it isnt enough give them 10k but inflating the gear even more in favor of 25mans is the wrong way to go. <br />
<br />
The fact that it already drops 1 extra item compared to what the size should indicate in drops is bad enough adding in this disaster of inflated gear being more common in 25 will all but kill 10man raiding</div></div><hr />

Strange since i wanted 10 mans to be able to not having to ever again raid with the last 6-9 idiots that cant ever stand out of fire etc etc etc etc not about purples or loot just about not having to wipe to IDIOTS that cant see a big MASSIVE fire burning there shoes off.

What does it actually do to INCREASE interest into 25-man raiding, if all the 10-man raiders are happy with the change to STAY in 10-man raiding guilds?<br />
<br />
The answer is nothing. This didn't fix the problem. It's hardly even a band-aid. If Blizzard wants 25's to be any sort of relevance again, they need to go about this in half of the Wrath system. 25's needs higher item level all across the board, but 10-man should drop lower item level version of IDENTICAL items. That and that alone was the ONLY thing that &quot;screwed&quot; over 10-man, was that the best in slot items (usually trinkets) came only from the 25-man versions of the raids. As long as the items do the exact same things and have the exact same stats weights, but lower item level, then both raids get what they want. 25's gets higher reward for more logistical effort (and in most cases, difficulty...sorry 10-man raiders but you know it's true, look at the fights that require spacing of a raid group and tell me they're harder on 10-man...I rest my case), and 10-man raiders aren't &quot;forced&quot; to do 25's because they're getting the stat weights that give them their best in slot capacity at the stat totals they need to clear their raids.<br />
<br />
This was a horrendous concept, and I really hope they analyze this with a magnifying lens. You're not going to see an increase in 25-man raiding guilds with this change, period. At best, you'll simply stop seeing a decline. Considering of all raiding guilds LESS than 10% of them raid 25-mans now...that's hardly acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are exaggerating the effect this will have, especially since we don't know what the drop chances for the higher ilvl loot is. If it were 100% in the 25s then I would agree with you. But for all we know it could be 1% on 10 and 2% on 25. Regardless, the bonus is not strong enough to cause a mass exodus over to 25s. We might see a few more pop up, but it will not be a dramatic effect. Top end guilds might switch, but the average 10-man will probably not. We'll see a small rise overall in the number of 25-man raids, but 10 man will still make up the overwhelming majority of raids.</div></div><hr />
