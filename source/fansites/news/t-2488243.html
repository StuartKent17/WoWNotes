To be fair, spending half an hour in a login queue only for the realm list window to timeout back to the login screen does generate a lot of stress, which I'm assuming is the point of the test. Also, it's a good reminder of how things were back in the day. Only then I was playing over dial-up :p</div></div><hr />

I just hope they don't take this as they need a bunch of servers on launch and then half of them or more end up empty when the inevitable population drop happens.</div></div><hr />

It’s likely a ton of people do islands for one reason or another. Probably more then do mythic+.</div></div><hr />

I don't know a single person (and I have a lot of WoW friends) who actually enjoy IEs. Most of them do solely it for either AP or pets/mount grind. I'm also the same, I stopped doing them the second I capped my necklace.<br />
<br />
They are dull and not fun. Also, try queueing for a PvP IE and see what happens. The queue for it is like an hour long, that shows you how popular it is. Even rated 3s arena which is the least popular as it's been in years still have near instant queues.<br />
<br />
<br />
IE is a failed experiment no matter how you look at it. If they weren't required for certain collectibles, pretty much no one would do them.</div></div><hr />

There are also many people who don’t like PvP dungeons or raid so many that you could say if they weren’t required for gear and certainly collectibles no one would be doing them. Fact of the matter is people do them and Probably in high numbers given that blizzard keeps adding to them.</div></div><hr />

Then just go by actual facts. The actual &quot;challenge&quot; portion of them that require forming 3 person groups are dead. No ones queueing for PvP and the only reason the queues for the PvE one is fast is because you're pairing up against computer opponents. It's a failed system when you compare it with every other aspect of the game (Arena/BGs/Dungeons/Raiding/WQs). They need to just ditch IE and Warfronts and concentrate on the parts of the game the players actually do.</div></div><hr />

We don’t have the actual facts as we have no numbers at all. We know people do islands for a variety of reasons but that’s about it, the numbers could beat out all those things or be way behind we don’t know only blizzard does.</div></div><hr />

That’s not how facts work like at all. PvP is a small fraction of the game grouped PvP is even smaller fraction looking at islands solely through the lense of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction isn’t a fact it’s nothing.<br />
<br />
The only fact to be had is that islands get enough attention from the player base that blizzard feels there worth putting time into unlike say 5v5 areas which were taken out all together.</div></div><hr />

Here I’ll do it for you.<br />
A fact is a thing that is known to be consistent with objective reality and can be proven to be true with evidence. For example, &quot;this sentence contains words&quot; is a linguistic fact, and &quot;the sun is a star&quot; is a cosmological fact.<br />
<br />
So let’s do a little test, “no one does islands because the PvP ques are an hour” given that it leaves out the three other ways to do islands and it in of it self can change and not be consistent your statement clearly isn’t a fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You actually took the &quot;no one does islands because PvP queues are hour long&quot; literally? No shit people do islands or else the queue would be infinity long. The FACT is that islands are UNPOPULAR because queues where you actually depend on other players to queue is taking 1 hour. The PvE queues are fast because you are playing against NPCs, so the only possible way we can judge IE popularity (other than getting data from Blizz which will prob never happen) is to judge it by queue times of PvP. There is no other way we can objectively judge IE popularity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is why your claim of fact is nonsense. You can speculate that they are barely played but out side of PvP which is a minority of a minority we have nothing even slightly objective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that queue is an hour long is a fact. I'm using this fact to deduce that it's unpopular. All you're doing is attacking my fact instead of providing your own to help your argument. Nice ad hominem attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pointing out that the PvP que time is not an objective way to gauge popularity is in no way an ad hominem. Ques also fluctuate or come up sooner then predicted, so even that isn’t a fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it is. Unless Blizz is intentionally bottlenecking queues (which we can assume they use the same system as the queues for rated 3s) there would be no reason for an hour long queues unless there is just very few teams queueing. I gave up trying to get my PvP island achievements because no one was willing to sit in the queue for that long. We could play like 10 rated arena matches in that time.<br />
<br />
IE was a failed concept and I'd be shocked if they brought it back for 9.0 in its current iteration.</div></div><hr />

You’d have a point if PvP islands weren’t 1/4 of the ways to do them.</div></div><hr />
