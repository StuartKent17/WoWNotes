<br />
All About Tournaments<br />

The events will be 3v3 Arena Tournaments on live realms<br />
There is a double elimination bracket<br />
Team rosters are 4-player, but you can sign-up with 3<br />

5th and 6th places &gt; 12 points each<br />
<br />
<br />
All About Points<br />
This is a great year for esports and a big year for World of Warcraft. The new points system allows us to spread tournaments consistently throughout the year, which keeps up the momentum and excitement— from the tournament all the way to the Championship. Don’t forget, the top 12 teams are the ones who earn their place in the Championship.<br />
<br />
All About Rosters<br />
<br />
Didn’t finish in the top 6 in the first tournament? Not a problem! Teams can change their team members as often as they want, until points are earned. Once you have points on the board, your teams are set in stone. Well, except. . .<br />
Teams who earn points are allotted one roster swap without consequences.<br />
After the free swap, there is an automatic 50% reduction to your points tally.<br />
If you want to know more, you should definitely read the official rules below.<br />
<br />
<br />

Signups are live!<br />
Signups will be open until 9:00am PDT on April 3rd.<br />

The open tournament bracket starts on April 6th, and plays through until the 7th.<br />
The last 8 teams will be broadcast live on Twitch on Saturday, April 8th starting at 11:00am PDT.<br />
We’re excited to partner-up with GCDTV, who will be helping us out with all that has to happen behind the scenes (which is a lot).<br />

Want To Run Your Own Tournament?<br />
We would love to see more of these! The more community involvement the better and there are some seriously solid reasons for doing it. Community-run tournaments directly impact which teams end up in the Arena World Championships, as all approved community-run events award points. If you’re even remotely interested, here’s what you should do: read the guide, fill out the application form (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/QH7J0750E2KT1490206134230.pdf) and send it to us. If you have any questions about running your own event, get in touch (WoWEsportsAdmin@Blizzard.com). We’re here to help and want you to create as many buzzing community events as it’s possible to have.<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - March 24<br />
On Friday, March 24, we will be conducting raid testing of Heroic Tomb of Sargeras bosses.<br />
<br />
Friday, March 24<br />
<br />
Demonic Inquisition - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras<br />
11:00 PST (14:00 EST, 20:00 CET)<br />
<br />
Maiden of Vigilance - Heroic Tomb of Sargeras<br />
12:00 PST (15:00 EST, 21:00 CET)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Feedback<br />
Changes may (will) not happen immediately, but &quot;got a new spell/buffed spell and really liked it&quot; is a great basis for feedback (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/842559588461236224))<br />
<br />
I think &quot;I love this legendary bonus and it should be baseline&quot; is great feedback and keep it up everyone (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/842558869624700928))<br />

are infernals considered elementals?<br />
We consider them demons in both WoW and Hearthstone, despite the stony complexion. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/842760166273515520))<br />

Legendary Bad Luck Protection - Follower Items<br />
Just dropping in so there's a Blue post to reference in the future:<br />
<br />
Follower Legendaries do not have any impact on the bad luck protection for your character and won't affect the chances of obtaining your next Legendary.

Reap Souls Resetting<br />
Thanks for all the feedback. Details will be forthcoming, but we do want to do something to help Tormented Soul generation near the start of encounters (wherever the new resetting takes place). It's still important that the resources at the start of an encounter be somewhat standardized, but we understand that starting at 0 and not being able to use Reap Soul during your opening burst isn't a timing that feels great for that ability.

<br />
Wings are harder to animate and more difficult to fit onto the model. <br />
<br />
Invincible's wings actually change size on the model when they unfurl.<br />
<br />
And Tyrael's charger's wings just look... weird. They look like a .gif image playing in a constant cycle, even when it's idle on the ground.</div></div><hr />

I believe this is supposed to be Invincible before Arthas became the Lich King. They should have had holy light wings appear when it goes into flight form to match the model of wings that the undead version has. Invincible is one of the best mounts in the game, imo. This would be right up there with this simple change.</div></div><hr />

Same with the Lock mount. It's kinda dull, higher definition but less detail.</div></div><hr />

It's just another human horse reworked. Worst *class* mount imo. <br />
<br />
Shamans get an awesome elemental, priests a unique owlbeast, hunters a hawk-wolf-thing that looks pretty cool. Paladins get a...nother HORSE!! <br />
<br />
Such creativity, very well thought, much innovation, wow!<br />

I really dont want to be the negative-guy, but apart from the Headless Horseman's mount, every other horse (or tiger/etc) flying WITHOUT WINGS looks STUPID!<br />
<br />
Yeah, even in fantasy games. <br />
And i for one like the model of this horse. But w/o wings its BAD. My 2c.</div></div><hr />

I'm also still out of the loop as to what spec is what color (And why there's 4 different ones for that matter)<br />
<br />
<br />
The last one is the base one, all paladins get the golden one. You can then, once you have every point in your artifact can buy for 10k resources (unless that changed since I last checked) and can buy the one specific to the spec as long as you've filled out that weapon. If that makes sense.*<br />
<br />
*So as a Ret paladin, I start with the end gold one, but then if I want I need my weapon to have all points in it, then spend resources to buy that particular look.<br />
<br />
Then I believe from left to right is prot/holy/ret (I think, I know for sure the red one is ret but the other two I might have mixed up)</div></div><hr />

I am thankful to Blizzard that they didn't say &quot;but guys, you druids, warlocks and paladins, have your mounts already so nothing new for you&quot; but instead they are adding new, different mounts for these classes, yet of the same type. I think that paladins are recognized by their horses, it would be weird to have some other mount instead, unless that was just a complimentary, non important extra. Unfortunately all new class mounts are just average...</div></div><hr />

Paladin mount, lazy, uninspired, and ugly. Getting the short end, as usual.</div></div><hr />

Like for real, it doesn't look belfy at goddamned all.<br />
<br />
Even then, it could be red/black/yellow glow instead to be closer to a blood knight vibe...as it looks now it's a crimson deathcharger pre-death. :/</div></div><hr />

Human, Dwarf, Draenei, Blood elf, and Tauren.<br />

So unless they are combining 1 horse among 2 races...</div></div><hr />

<br />
cant be the races, bc<br />
- the thing previous poster mentioned (there are 5 races)<br />
- all the other classes mounts target the spec (water for resto shaman, arcane for arcane mage etc.)<br />
- so its obvious they target the specs<br />
- if it was the races, tauren wouldnt ride on a horse.... :)<br />
<br />
so, its ofc the specs, they target.<br />
<br />
and since we just have 3 of them, i still dont get it.<br />
<br />

and that fukin horses should have pegasus-like wings, when start flying. even when the wings are just a mist of some wings. but a flying horse without wings looks soooo silly. the only thing where this is and should be ok, is the headless horseman.</div></div><hr />
