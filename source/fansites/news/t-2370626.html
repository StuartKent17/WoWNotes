In Arcway last boss, while he's casting banish in time (phase transition) is no longer targetable (probably finally works as intend, however I didn't see any notice about it)</div></div><hr />

Probably not saying your high end rigs are mid to low grade, more likely saying they don't have a fix for you yet. Just the low end guys so far.</div></div><hr />

Yes!! Its practically in the name!!! Its right between the 1060 and the 1080!!<br />

<br />
Not even close to true. <br />
<br />
The 10 series cards are miles ahead of the last generation, and magnitudes faster than 8xx etc. Looking over the most recent Steam survey results, the 10 series cards are not very common... with the 1070 being highest represented at 1.69% of the respondents. http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/<br />
<br />
Just because it is &quot;mid&quot; range in the CURRENT tier of Nvidia cards, does not make it &quot;mid&quot; range for the general population.</div></div><hr />

Coupled, possibly, with the new CPU meltdown bug fix which kills performance by ~ 20%, makes sense to me to see the huge FPS dropes for every machine across the board :)</div></div><hr />

Well the FPS dipped on my 1080 as well, so... :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple math job: please find the mid range 1030, 1050, 1050ti, 1060, 1060 6gb, 1070, 1070ti, 1080, 1080ti<br />
<br />
Hint: 1070 is the fourth from the top and seventh from bottom....additional help: mid range is 1050ti, 1060, 1060 6gb..1070 is at the bottom of high end...but psst..it`s secret</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that's a mid level CPU from 2011. I'd consider it low end.<br />
<br />
However I was having issues with my 5820K and Titan X Pascal as well.</div></div><hr />

I cannot imagine that a PR employee would not realize it would piss people off by using low/mid tier. It would have been better to just say they've worked on (some of) the fps issues, period.<br />
<br />
It's like they're trying to draw the attention to it, even though there are multiple (game-breaking) issues, adds bugging out in dungeons, bosses in raids etc for instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really read up on it, the hit to gaming performance is around 1%-2%. So small that you're not going to notice the 1 fps difference in real world.</div></div><hr />
