Warcraft Battle for Azeroth Story Panel<br />
Matthew Mercer talked with Christie Golden, Steve Danuser, and Terran Gregory about the World of Warcraft story at E3.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&amp;video=272811903&amp;t=02h27m31s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Christie Golden co-wrote the theme song for Hearthstone's Kobolds and Catacombs.<br />
Stabbing Azeroth with a sword was not as hard as killing Varian Wrynn for the cinematic team.<br />
More amazing cutscene events are lined up for the near future in BfA.<br />
More recent cinematics have the ability to incorporate the player character to keep them involved and the drivers of the world.<br />
World of Warcraft Chronicle Volume 3 creates the lore of which faction killed notable bosses and raids to better help include players in the narrative of the story.<br />
Faction &quot;conflict&quot; has always been a part of the story but Battle for Azeroth is the first time all out faction &quot;war&quot; is the issue.<br />
There's nothing like a resource drive like Azerite to create conflict.<br />
Blizzard told Christie Golden that they wanted Before the Storm to dive deeply into the motivations of Anduin and Sylvanas.<br />
Killing major characters is inevitable when progressing the story and never easy. Not everyone has a heroic death or one that comes unexpectedly. <br />
The little bits of story seen already will blossom over the course of the expansion.<br />
There are 20-some quest designers for WoW currently.<br />
The story and animation department for WoW has a couple of hundred artists but they also work on other Blizzard IPs. The dedicated WoW group is 20-30 people.<br />
There is more content coming out soon for launch that hasn't been talked about yet, including stuff that hasn't been tried before.<br />
Characters are utilized more when it makes sense for what the story is currently trying to tell.<br />
<br />
<br />

Warfronts Play With The Blues Friday<br />
Join us on Friday, June 15 from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. PDT and help test Warfronts in the Battle for Azeroth Beta.<br />
<br />
We're going to focus testing on the Scenario portion of Warfronts, and to get as many testers in there as possible, we'll remove pre-requisites and spawn special war tables in each faction's capital city. You'll be able to queue for this one with a level 110 (or higher) character.<br />
<br />
We'll update this post with more information on the playtest. Stay tuned!<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts Testing and Feedback<br />
With the current Beta build, Beta testers are experiencing the entirety of the Warfronts: Battle for Stromgarde experience. An alternating cycle kicked off on Thursday, June 7 between the Horde and Alliance vying for control of Stromgarde and Arathi Highlands. Both Horde and Alliance testers have queued since then.<br />
<br />
Here’s an outline of how the cycle works:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Alliance starts with ownership of Arathi Highlands, and Horde players challenge them by contributing professions items, gold, and War Resources to help their faction build up enough strength to attack. This is a region-wide effort. Once enough contributions are supplied by the region, the Warfront: Battle for Stromgarde unlocks and Horde players are able to queue for the experience. This queue remains open for a set duration, allowing players to complete the Warfront on a schedule that works for them. After the Horde attack is complete, the Horde takes control of Arathi Highlands, giving them access to a unique World Boss and a series of rare spawns and other rewards only available during the period when their faction owns the zone. The Alliance then begins contributing resources to challenge Horde control.<br />
<br />
The cycle continues perpetually, with each faction competing against the other to gain access more quickly or reduce the enemy team’s access to the zone. Currently, the queue window in the Beta is set to remain open for 2 days.<br />
<br />
Notably, this update included a first look at a completely updated version of the Arathi Highlands zone, including new creatures, as well as access to your faction’s base in the zone, and plenty of other surprises.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to post your feedback on Warfronts in this thread, and please submit issues with Warfronts to our BFA Beta Bug Report Forum.<br />
<br />
Hey guys, few additional clarifications for you from the development team:<br />
<br />
In order to be eligible to queue for Warfronts, you need to be level 120, and have completed enough of the campaign to have unlocked World Quests. We're also working to make it more apparent when the Warfront is actually open, and what its current state is. We previously had Warfronts available starting at level 110 for early testing; that is no longer the case.<br />
<br />
Also just to clarify an earlier point: each state of the Warfront should be active for approximately two days, but the exact amount of time can change based on player participation. We're not planning on accelerating that any further in the Beta for the time being, because we want to see how things work out on this schedule.<br />
<br />
The feedback we've gotten so far has been very helpful, especially the points where the system seemed confusing or unclear. Warfronts are pretty complex, and one of our goals with Beta is to figure out ways to make them understandable. This is part of why we haven't directly explained too much about how they work; we want to hear how you experience them naturally, and where that experience stumbles, so that we can make it more clear. Keep it coming!<br />

<br />
it's gonna suck a bit to find that certain bosses will now &quot;in lore&quot; be &quot;if you not faction X you didn't actually take part in X raid (now)&quot;</div></div><hr />

You think they should pay 100+ people to sit around and do nothing when they aren't needed? <br />
<br />
It really isn't as bad as it sounds. They probably have a few &quot;gun guys&quot; so whenever a game needs a gun it goes to them, because they're good at it. They probably have scenery guys. Just because the artist isn't exclusive to WoW does not mean they aren't capable of turning out A grade work for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason they did well was because those books she was writting a different sort of character, we didnt see it as flawed writing, we just saw it as that character. More specifically she focused on Thrall, Durotan, and Doomhammer. Whom she all wrote as &quot;Orcs, but they act different from other Orcs.&quot; As in, she wrote them like humans.<br />
<br />
As time went on, we kinda figured out she is incapable of writing good characters as anything but cookie cutter human-likes. Whenever she writes a none-human they either act human, or act evil. <br />
<br />
Plus we were coming off of Knaak who is also a bad writer, but at least he had fun. At least he didn't shove in romance. So while it was bad we at least got some neat tidbits. Golden however is just constantly stale and cookie cutter and cant fathom that game scale =/= real scale.</div></div><hr />

I have never liked her style. It is all over. Like fanfic commited by girls after watching twilight.<br />
<br />
She's written quite a lot of books before World of Warcraft was her job. I recognized her name immediately upon seeing her announced by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Some of the books I've read by her:<br />
<br />
Star Trek: Voyager: Gateways Book 5: No Man's Land, Pocket Books, October 2001<br />
Star Trek: Gateways Book 7: What Lay Beyond: In the Queue, Pocket Books, November 2001<br />
<br />
Star Trek: Voyager #6: The Murdered Sun, Pocket Books, February 1996<br />
Star Trek: Voyager #14: Marooned, Pocket Books, December 1997<br />
Star Trek: Voyager #16: Seven of Nine, Pocket Books, September 1998<br />
Star Trek: Voyager: Endgame, (with Diane Carey), Pocket Books, July 2001<br />
Star Trek: Voyager: Homecoming, Pocket Books, June 2003<br />
Star Trek: Voyager: The Farther Shore, Pocket Books, July 2003<br />
(3 of those 7 set in a specific universe following Voyager's series end)<br />
<br />
Star Trek: Voyager #19: Dark Matters #1: Cloak and Dagger, Pocket Books, November 2000<br />
Star Trek: Voyager #20: Dark Matters #2: Ghost Dance, Pocket Books, November 2000<br />
Star Trek: Voyager #21: Dark Matters #3: Shadow of Heaven, Pocket Books, November 2000<br />
<br />
Star Wars: Dark Disciple, Del Rey Books, June 2015<br />
<br />
If you look at her list of books (much larger than what I posted and have read), there is a general theme to them all. She likes to write for popular (at the time) sci-fi and fantasy. She wouldn't get the opportunity if neither the fans nor the editor liked her work, nor would she have been hired by Blizzard. I'm not saying she's perfect or a panacea, but it stands to reason she may not be as bad as you portray.<br />
There are plenty of bad writers being hired because of their connections. And Golden doesn't appear to posses craft strong enough to warrant her publication. But hell, she is here now and Blizzard and her will milk and turn milk into cheese as long as it sells.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galathir</div><div class="date">2018-06-14, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Garbage interview. Patting themselves on the back how BfA is about perspective and everything is morally gray when a big part of the playerbase is worried because they see the exact opposite.<br />
Only judging by what I have seen on the beta and heard about the novel (haven't had time to read it yet) BfA is the clearest black &amp; white expansion yet.<br />
(Yeah, they warn about judging from alpha/beta infos but how about showing a single morally questionable thing Anduin does)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toppy</div><div class="date">2018-06-14, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently the line about Worgen tails in the Before The Storm book is a typo.

<br />
I just picture it in my head, the editor panicing as they pace through the books wondering why the hell Golden thought Worgen had tails.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I haven't read the books, it does seem this particular expansion (especially what I've seen on beta) has been less morally ambiguous/gray. In a way, they need that in order to fuel the faction conflict. <br />
<br />
If I had a bet on this, I'd say this is intentional to get the factions fighting each other so something more sinister that is waiting in the wings can take advantage of the chaos. It is a typical sci-fi/fantasy trope. Though, in this case, it is drawn out over an expansion so it doesn't seem as immediately obvious.<br />
<br />
The problem is that they keep saying this is morally grey when the writing is so very clearly black and white, more so than its ever been. They are patting themselves on the back for doing the complete opposite of what they're saying, and dont seem to be aware of this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fetus Rex</div><div class="date">2018-06-14, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you would like some cheese with your sour grapes, no? In seriousness though, she's not bad. Here's another data point. She also wrote for Blizzard with Starcraft. So, if she sold badly, she wouldn't have had the opportunity to go full time almost 6 years later. They have data on how well she has sold for them, you do not (nor do I, frankly). <br />
<br />
Large companies always do a cost-benefit analysis and an ROI analysis (return on investment). She clearly has what they're looking for even if we can't see all of what that means on the back end. That said, I don't fundamentally have an objection to them bringing in an established writer. A lot of sci-fi and fantasy series are doing this because it provides a more robust experience (a particular sci-fi show I know was failing miserably for 3 seasons until they brought in established authors to do their last season - which turned out substantially better than the first three). <br />

You may not like her style. No problem there. That doesn't mean she is bad. It means you don't like her work. Good for you, but you're not the only person reading it and your opinion is apparently not shared by the folks who love the work. (I am of neutral opinion since I generally don't read books based on a video game.)<br />
<br />
But she is bad. The thing with big franchise books is that they ill sell no matter how terrible authors are. People want more lore, that's mostly it. SO many trashy Star Wars book were released and people were swallowing them fast to get their story fix.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that they keep saying this is morally grey when the writing is so very clearly black and white, more so than its ever been. They are patting themselves on the back for doing the complete opposite of what they're saying, and dont seem to be aware of this.<br />

According to Christie, she was thinking up typical werewolf things. Fangs gnashing, claws twitching, tails lashing, that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

That just makes it all the worse. She isnt thinking in setting.</div></div><hr />

I mean, Worgen are basically just werewolves with a twist. I don't think it's that much of a stretch to forget that they don't have tails.</div></div><hr />
