<br />
Patch 8.2 Hotfixes - July 17th, 2019<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />

<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Conflict and Strife (Essence) now uses a character’s specialization PvP talent icon as the active ability button.<br />

The Ever-Rising Tide’s (Essence) Overcharge Mana stacks can now be removed by dispels (e.g. Dispel Magic or Purge).<br />
Fixed an issue where The Ever-Rising Tide’s (Essence) Overcharge Mana sometimes granted a stack for a spell cast immediately before it was activated.<br />

<br />
Fury<br />
<br />
Battle Trance now properly triggers from Raging Blows buffed by Whirlwind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Players no longer gain the Deserter debuff when exiting the Classic Ashran brawl.<br />
Fixed an issue that caused some PvP talents to display in the chat window that they have been learned when entering PvP combat, or have the PvP talent through Conflict and Strife.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Players can now find even more Coral Ancients to slay for “Bounty: More Coral Ancients”.<br />
