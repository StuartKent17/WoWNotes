EU servers have maintenance a day later then US. Their Tuesday kill was the last day of the raid week for them.<br />

It may seem diluted...but &quot;the best&quot; will always be hated by some. To say that &quot;QQ the world hates ensidia but loves method&quot; is completely ignoring the praise that ensidia DOES get from the majority of the community.<br />
<br />
People hate the yankees more fervently than any other baseball franchise around. You know why? Because for a very long time they were THE best. People love to hate the best because it makes them feel better.</div></div><hr />

So true...<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, GZ to Method for the second kill!<br />

P.S. Method is from EU-Sylvanas. <br />

Ofc method deserves to get a ''well done'' But Ensidia doesnt deserve to be flamed!..<br />
<br />
<br />
Ensidia has a history of belittling the accomplishments of other guilds. Back when they were still Nihilum and the SWP race was on, they were knocking every guild that got a World First before them by saying &quot;Only the final boss matters&quot;. Ensidia's remarks towards other guilds getting world firsts are why they get flamed. Hell, Kungen knocks Method getting a World 2nd claiming that without a video they wouldn't have beaten the encounter.<br />
<br />
In short, Ensidia brings the hate upon themselves by their actions.</div></div><hr />

My mate just said close to the same thing, Method would have got it either way, they would have already known the fight by that point, they were only what, one or so weeks behind Ensidia? It was just a matter of them pulling it off, and they did.<br />
A very big Grats to Method!!! Well Done Guys!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

nihilum and SK merged, to make the best guild in the world. (with the best players) and ensidia was born ya ya ya da da (old news)<br />
<br />
must say Grats to Ensidia getting world first on Algalon 25. and grats to Method for 2nd world kill.<br />
<br />
but Method is still the best guild in my eyes. they atleast need to recruit people. Ensida dont they just recruit because they want to.<br />
<br />
but yeah these are my 5 cents.<br />

Grats to both guilds again, lets hope next instance is good and abit more hard for you guys :P</div></div><hr />

Very true. Ensidia is a conglomeration of TWO raiding guilds...SK Gaming was fast approaching Nihilum's success...and chances are would have surpassed them. This is why in my opinion Nihilum &quot;joined&quot; together with SK....they couldn't handle if they weren't &quot;World First&quot; anymore.<br />
<br />
Talking down about another guild is just childish Let's NOT forget Kungen....you guys used an EXPLOIT to get past Hodir....you've already admitted it....Blizz changed the encounter AFTER you did it...which essentially locked every other guild out.<br />
<br />
Grats to Method for their kill....here's to hoping you surpass Ensida, Kungen, his HUGE ego and all his fanbois going forward.<br />

Grats Ensidia for making yourselves look like a bunch of whiny elitist douche bags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure it did. It gave them exclusive access. Hodir was the last &quot;block&quot; Ensidia had to unlock Algalon. They exploited the encounter to get past it. Blizzard immediately fixed that exploit.<br />
<br />
Had Ensidia not exploited (LoL 500% more damage with 8 mages in the raid) the encounter they would not have been able to access Algalon when they did.<br />
<br />
Kungen should have just congratulated Method for their kill and left it at that. But no....he had to feed his ego by talking shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course their are other factors like understanding class etc but the actual skill required to dodge this and that and remember where to stand in a pre scripted event isn't very high.<br />
<br />
Ensida aren't better players than any other hardcore guild or semi-hardcore guild, they just have more time and dedication than the rest to learn the scripted events which take place in a PVE event.<br />
<br />
For that they should be praised but not worshipped or treated like super stars.<br />

Pretty funny...considering you can do any of those bosses in ANY order....so technically...Any of those bosses could be the &quot;last&quot; boss. Have you even seen Hodir or Mimiron...heck....have you even been in Ulduar?<br />
<br />
As far as Mimiron being the &quot;Block&quot;....if that's the case...why did Ensidia HAVE to resort to using an exploit to drop Hodir?</div></div><hr />

False information. We don't get payed to play. More about this here: http://ensidia.com/community/post/92/?page=2#1393<br />
False information. We probably even got fewer guildmembers than most Ulduar-raiding guilds.<br />
False information again. Can you also stop believing that you're the only guys in the world that have to work? I study full time at university and make 100% of my income through my own freelance business, and I have more than enough time to play in this guild.<br />
False information. We only got one 25man raid and one alt raid, and the alt raid is obviously not raiding during progress.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Stop talking about stuff you don't have a clue about.<br />

<br />
Point by point:<br />
<br />
Afaik Kungen does not have a job, never had. I kinda know his status over some friends that know him for years. He lives and feeds of Swedish welfare system. (at least he did untill he signed a contract with Mousesports which made him not viable for it anymore. But on the other hand he got more from them then his monthly fee from welfare). <br />
<br />
You maybe don`t get payed. Those measly 150/250 euros you got each + few gamecards ain`t much i agree when your 3 leaders + site mannager get over 3k euros each / month. Those 1k euro screens you were promissed may never arrive tho. Depends how greedy your masters get.<br />
<br />
You may have less members then most guilds, but each member has at least 3-4 alts that are 24/7 in instances gearing up for anything you might need. 'Yes, we have a life' statement does not stand there, sorry.<br />
<br />
As long as you try to deny anything, /who ensidia during the week reveals exactly how much time you placed during ulduar beggining to gear alts/test tactics/get multiaccess to Algalon. You had 4-5 groups running Algalon 10 for weeks for example which in end proved vital in perfecting tactics and execution for 25man. <br />
<br />
You make your money through freelance business? How about you ripped off website money and claimed that &quot;company that was hired failed to deliver&quot; ? Site was in &quot;preparation&quot; since September 1st 2008, and we all know how soon it was delivered. You and that guy &quot;Hams&quot; i believe were given the trust to contact a company and sort website design and everything. After a while you had to re-do everything as &quot;company failed&quot;. Hardly any serious company that is gonna get payed for the work would &quot;fail&quot; on the deadline for 6+ months. Tho i`m not suprised. You lied, so stealing was next in line on TO DO list for you.<br />
<br />
Site hosting, bandwidth and everything associated with it is not cheap nowadays. Since there are no advertisements on Ensidia webpage, you gotta have someone covering that from his own pocket for his own interest.<br />
<br />
I guess that this guy here: http://serbandsteel.dingblog.com/ actually had some strong points when you take everything into consideration, and not blindly stand and trust what a bunch of egoistic maniacs says as their 'public defense'. If you say that there are no proofs to what he stated, there are also no proofs to what YOU state. Have a nice day. Oh, and Grats Method, awsome nerdscreams right there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So using low level alts to soul stone 25 people is somehow better than finding a sweet buff to spell steal? Both guilds are willing to think outside the box to find any advantage they can, even if unintended, when there are situations where fights are tuned in a way that they are impossible in other circumstances. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

1. Method and Inner Sanctum had killed Hodir already and let's face it they are pretty much the only competition Ensidia has now. <br />
<br />
2. The rest of the guilds had their Hodir nerf before they were able to kill Mimiron, which means that Hodir did not block their progression to Algalon. <br />
<br />
1+2 = The fact that Ensidia &quot;exploited&quot; did not affect the race for Algalon in any way.</div></div><hr />

But somehow they need to act tuff behind a computer screen!<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong. I would refuse a guild invite in a heartbeat. I've done the hardcore raid scene, and I never plan on going back.<br />
<br />
And no, all this &quot;dissing&quot; on Ensidia is not acting tough, it is stating facts and drawing conclusions and opinions from those facts. You can cheer lead for them all you want, but at the end of the day, they are still filled with egotistical a-holes that feel the need to demean the achievements of other guilds and exploit every chance they get to stay on top. <br />
<br />
And that is a fact.</div></div><hr />

Props were at their place each time WF happened. We're here discussing the &quot;all guilds are on the same ground&quot; thingy. Members of Ensidia do have skills, dedication and time, like anyone denies it :S But the &quot;sponsors&quot; part of the story goes a lot deeper then just site/hardware/bills, and the fact is - one guild is above others, making statements and actions that offence others, single members saying very strong words on forums and etcetera which leads to hypocrisy and lies and makes me personally and a lot of &quot;inside&quot; people sick. It's not about &quot;brainwashing&quot; and forum trolling, it's not about defending guilds as Method and asking for their world's 2nd to be made 1st out of nowhere. God no. I just have a feeling that soon enough, maybe even this month the whole story will be made available for anyone who wants to read it and then we can talk about &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;not fair&quot; based on the actual facts, not simply speculations.<br />

I'm just warming up the crowd, story will be published when author will decide it's finished (this month i assume), and right now it's missing only a few more things to nail unholy truth to the masses :)<br />
<br />
Talking about chinese, yeah, these guys must have some great potential fo sho, almost forgot about them :&lt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karreck</div><div class="date">2009-06-05, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, saying they dont have lives, and no one in Ensidia has a job is clearly stating the facts, I can see that! smh. You, and alot of other people say they are ''a-holes'' and such, but I dont see Ensidia running around saying bad things about you, so why are they ''a-holes'' and you are not? If the world was perfect, then everybody would give a big Gz to ensidia, and a big Gz to method! but instead people feel the need to constantly bad mouth ensidia, instead of giving them the props that they without a doubt deserves. And to all the people who say ensidia wins becouse they have sponsors!? why does that make a difference in the race? it doesnt give them more time then the other top guilds, and it's not like the sponsors have super people who sometimes play instead of the ensidia members so they can down bosses.<br />
<br />

<br />
And did I ever state that they have no lives or jobs? No. I present their attitude towards other guilds as my reason for disliking them, and I feel that I am well within my right to feel such a way. If the world was perfect, Ensidia wouldn't need to bad mouth guilds that beat them to World First or even belittle those that get World Second. In a perfect world Ensidia would be the first to offer up &quot;grats&quot;. But the world is not perfect, and neither is Ensidia. Is Ensidia the top guild? Yes. Do they play hard to stay in that spot? Yes. But respect is not given freely, it has to be earned. And in game accomplishments mean little to me if you are behaving in the way Kungen and others in Ensidia act. Call me old fashioned, but I respect good sportsmanship and class more than game achievements. Because at the end of the day, I would rather lose with dignity than win and be an a-hole. And I judge others by the same merit.</div></div><hr />

I think we should end it here, it's getting out of hand!. Clearly nothing can stop you guys hating so much on ensidia, so it's pointless really. At the end of the day, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I respect that, even though I feel another way<br />
So I think we should just agree to disagree ehh? :) <br />
<br />

<br />
No, I said that me &quot;flaming&quot; Ensidia was stating fact. I have said nothing about whatever employment they may have. And while yes, everybody has and is entitled to their own opinion, please to not confuse or generalize such opinions as being lumped under &quot;they have no job/life&quot;. Is that a reason for some of the Ensidia hate? Yes. But it is not the reason for all of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont really see you saying ''me'' anywhere here. Instead you are indeed saying that all this ''dissing'', meaning, what other people say about them, and not what YOU are saying about them, is stating the facts.<br />
<br />
I ask if we should just forget about it, and then you hit me with this? Im done on this subject, and I think you should stop aswell, you are not making yourself look good<br />

In the quote from you that I was responding to, you also stated that &quot;all the dissing on Ensidia was people acting tuff&quot;, which I see as including me. Perhaps my statement was not clear enough, but I was refering to myself and others in a similar mindset. Sorry for the confusion.<br />
<br />
And no, asking to forget about a discussion does not mean the discussion will end. Nine times out of ten it means the person who suggests it wants to have the last word. If that is your goal, then be all means try. But as long as there is something to discuss, I will discuss it. And frankly, I do not care about making myself look good. I am a random name on a screen, so what do I have that needs to look good?</div></div><hr />

<br />
(btw, all players in Method have 2k euros 'a month employments i guess? they all doctors and carpenters etc and play wow on their little spare time?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whining over people doing Algalon before the one another = Nerd rage.<br />
Whining over Kungen whining at his movie aiding Method = Nerd rage.<br />
Whining over who is the best guild, swearing and spamming endless posts in this topic = Nerd rage.<br />
<br />
Why can't people just hug up, kiss each other, and congratulate each other on getting the kills fast? I will tell you: Epenis. <br />
<br />
In my world, it is just a matter of treating each other with proper respect. Kungen failed, people here failed, maybe I fail too, now stating peopel like you deserve no respect. <br />
<br />
Congratulations on your kill, Good luck recruiting. Hopefully you'll find players that won't go on an unoficial forum whining.<br />
