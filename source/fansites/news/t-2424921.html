To address some issues related to the Auction House, we’re reconsidering how deposits—the refundable fees you pay to list your auctions—are calculated. This fee is based on the item’s vendor price, and for profession materials in particular, vendors offer very low prices, so these mats have a low deposit cost. Deposits are substantial on items such as BoE uncommon gear, gems, and so forth, but not trade skill materials (trade goods such as cloth, ore, leather, etc.).<br />
<br />
One thing we’ve identified as particularly troublesome is a large volume of trade skill materials being auctioned off in stacks of 1. Some addons make posting quantities of this size trivial to do, resulting in dozens, if not hundreds, of pages of auctions for a single item. As we looked at ways to change this behavior and improve the overall Auction House experience, we found that we prefer to avoid inflexible solutions such as caps on the number of listings a player can make, or increased minimum stack counts, which might interfere with many players' common gameplay habits.<br />
<br />
Our current plan is to increase the deposit cost of some profession materials on a per-stack basis, which should provide incentive for players to post items in larger stacks.<br />
<br />
Here's an example:<br />
<br />
<br />
Let’s say that a player is trying to sell 200 Tidespray Linen for 10g (gold) each. Today, each item has the normal deposit cost of 1c (copper), with a 1s (silver) minimum deposit, so 1 auction of 200 linen requires a deposit of 1s, and 200 auctions of 1 linen each adds up to a total deposit of 2g.<br />
Now imagine an additional 20% deposit added to the listing fee per auction. With an asking price of 10g each, that raises the deposit by 2g per stack. In the case of 1 stack of 200 linen, the total buyout price is 2000g, and the new deposit is 2g1s. In the case of 200 individual stacks, the new deposit of an additional 2g per stack brings the total deposit up to 402g.<br />
<br />
<br />
In either case, the deposit is returned to the seller if the item sells. Successful auctions aren’t affected by this change.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to give players some forewarning on this change, and to gather feedback. We’re putting together a list of the items that would be affected by this deposit change, which we expect to be limited to high-quantity trade goods. Furthermore, we’re deploying the change to the PTR first, so that addon authors can work through the change while we test it thoroughly.<br />
<br />
This change will likely be a temporary measure, as we’re also working to broadly improve the default Auction House in the future. It’s clear to us that many players use addons because they find the default Auction House interface inadequate. A temporary change to deposit fees will help with this in the short term, and we’ll continue to work on overall improvements to the Auction House for a future patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quest Exploit Actions<br />
It seems that the frenzy of this WQ exploit is propagating a ton of misinformation, like 3 day bans going out and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Here's a real rundown:<br />
<br />
A WQ exploit was discovered (since hotfixed) that allowed one to get the rewards for completing a WQ, yet flag it has having not been completed, creating a cycle where one could gain the rewards over and over again, be it raw gold, gear, resources or most commonly, reputation.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, no official action has been taken yet against anyone, and that is likely due to the scale of damage done.<br />
<br />
This exploit undermined gearing (repeating gear quests for titanforges), economy (Raw gold, materials/expulsom from scrapping gear), and reputation gates (jumping to exalted on every rep in a day versus the intended few weeks). It's a massive amount of damage. Thousands of gold and reputation, tons of ilvls, resources, etc.<br />
<br />
Action will be taken. Unlike the cooking spices exploit that simply allowed people to powerlevel cooking, or the early Legion AP exploit that saw people get their AP reset that were fairly contained in scale, this exploit was effectively an item and gold dupe with far reaching impact.<br />
<br />
It's my personal opinion that anyone who abused this should be given a permenant ban, as it's clear this exploit circumvented and undermined multiple game systems for unfair benefit.<br />
<br />
Please stop spreading rumors that this was only a reputation exploit and that people are only getting 3 day temp bans for it. It's false information and the issue is much more serious than that.<br />
We are indeed aware of this exploit and have been working on a fix. We are also taking action against those who are abusing it.<br />

Outdoor Mob Scaling Issues<br />
I understand the concern about wanting to feel yourself get stronger but you still actually do have the ability to feel stronger, the world just feels a little relevant for a little longer while you're doing it and I think it achieves that. On my main I've already far outpaced it and at 341 I feel like a god again. I can pull a large number of mobs and easily handle them all and churn through WQs pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
I even leveled an alt up and geared it this weekend up to almost 320 ilvl and it felt just as fine as it did the first time. When I hit 120 I noticed the mobs were a little stronger and I was having to be a little more careful but not by much and that didn't last long at all.<br />
<br />
If you're finding mobs that do individually feel strange you should bug report them so the team can look into it but the system as a whole is working fine at least from my experience.<br />
<br />
He isn't on the dev/design team. He is providing his feedback as a player.<br />
Exactly. I'm just sharing what exactly my experience was when going through it both times and they both felt the same. I'm leveling a Warlock next so I'm interested to see the difference it makes as a clothie. I'll probably share my thoughts on that experience too but from my guildies they didn't even notice the scaling hardly at all even as a caster.<br />
<br />
Casters do have it worse than melee.<br />
Yeah this is what I'm interested in testing out myself and seeing how different it feels.<br />
<br />
I'm curious, have you ever played an elemental shaman? If so, how was your questing experience compared to other classes/specs?<br />
Elemental is usually always my second alt that I use for alt night raiding. I haven't quested with him yet but I plan on doing that one after Warlock. Historically for me it's always been fine, little slower obviously but still fine. <br />
<br />
this was never an issue in older expansions.<br />
<br />
people leveled to max level, and had fun when they got gear and stomped everything in the older content. that's what an mmo is, you get strong and go back and have fun lording over all the stupid crap you had to fight before.<br />
The point is it was an issue that always was there but you didn't pay much attention to it as a player nor really care too much about it to be honest. I didn't notice it either until the dev team had pointed it out. It seemed like something they always wanted to try to fix it or change it but never had the chance until now with the scaling tech they have now. <br />
<br />
It feels good to get stronger, to see your avatar in this world crush your foes, and it feels very good to get gear and get upgrades, that's a core feature of an MMO, there is no debating that or changing that. What's great though is being in a place where the content can be as relevant as possible and the rewards still match your time investment. One of the things Ion talked about with this system is that the health pool of open world mobs does get a little higher with your ilvl, but you get stronger in a faster pace. It's not making them infinitely stronger than you or making them comparative to you forever, its just a little bump at the beginning. By the time you're hitting 320 you are already far outpacing them at least from my experience.<br />
<br />
I think its a good topic to be aware of and concerned about and I 100% get the concern and agree that going overboard does counter a core feeling of the game, but if the beginning, middle, and end of the system still end with you being able to have that character progression and feel yourself progress then I think the system can work. When it doesn't is where you have the problems and of course the team doesn't want that. Which is why they ask for specifics on any issues you're finding so they can address them and fix it if needed.

The whole interface needs a huge revamp. These issues occur because we are running off a system designed for a fraction of the size the servers are now. It was designed for vanilla servers with less items, one faction, and one city. Sadly We will get this around the time we get a goblin vs gnome expansion when the horde have a fat goblin warchief.</div></div><hr />

At blizzcon they talked about changing it to you put in what you have, and people buy what they want. So people will put stacks of 200 and people buy however much they want from the stack. Also talked about work orders I believe. A player puts a work order in for 400 ore for 18k gold and anyone can fill it. I imagine work orders will be the way to go if you want to sell something quickly, or if you are a crafter and want cheaper ore. Put a work order in for 10% below market value, and eventually someone will fill it.<br />

My server has anywhere from 6-20 pages for a given mat depending on day/time. Prob on the lower end of server populations. I think it is a medium pop server atm, but in late Legion it fell to low.</div></div><hr />

When I used to sell mats I normally sell them in stacks of 5. As I thought that this is a good quantity to buy if you wanted to make one item.<br />

This. Instead of doing anything actually useful, they went the typical Blizzard route. Go figure. Blizzard's typical response is never to buff something, but to just nerf everything else. For the people that actually spam the AH with stacks of 1, this isn't going to affect them at all. It'll hardly put a dent into their bottom line. All it's going to do is cause more casual players to think twice about posting anything at all to the AH.<br />
<br />
The AH itself is in dire need of an overhaul to begin with. This is just one more clunky, useless change to it that it doesn't need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who farm thousands of mats to make scores and scores of gold probably care; they're likely the people flooding the markets the most as well. <br />
<br />
They guy who is trying to sell five spare ore wont care (and would probably list it in a stack of five.)<br />
<br />
The guy that plays the auction house and is trying to sell 2,000 cloth is going to care if it cuts into his profits if he lists them all one by one instead of in stacks of 200. <br />

The WQ exploit consisted of being in a party for a world quest and swiftly changing the group to a raid just before the last credit was completed. It resulted in you still being given the WQ rewards (rep, gold, etc.) even though the WQ wasn't actually completed due to being in a raid group. You'd then change back to a party to rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />

This change is meant to help servers which are completely broken atm. I play on Draenor EU since MoP and it's been broken since late WoD. AH is a horrible time sink to search and buy things. Guild bank takes 5 minutes to get 8-10 stacks of items if your lucky. Tired of this shit. They should open free transfers off this server, fix the slow ass guild stuff and lock the server for new players / incoming transfers until they rebuild the entire system to support the amount of players. It's not only Draenor this affects either I know there is other extreme high pop servers in the same boat.</div></div><hr />

They say is temporary, but the one stacks are like twinks. They are not there for an innocent/legitimate purpose. They are there to grief others. Aka, they push the other legitimate sellers many pages down for the buyers to lose patience and buy their one stacks. <br />
There is no legitimate reason to keep it around.<br />

They probably want to push the orders from the competition further behind, so people who are too lazy to scroll will buy their stuff first. I don't know. While having various stacks is sometimes nice to have as a buyer (because sometimes you just need a small amount to get one item done, or a handful of items, and sometimes you need a huge amount because you have to craft much more), I found it quite a hassle to list many offers as a seller. Though, I have not been selling much in the AH since the beginning of Legion...</div></div><hr />

Yes. I remember from beta, people moaning leveling is too easy and they should make everything harder. How people want to feel like the world is 'dangerous' and need to group up etc. <br />
You'll get complaints either way, though I think most people actually like things being easier. That's why automated grouping tools are so popular - quests are a means to an end, not a lot of people like slogging through killing 250k life mobs (that scale) to suck some 15% progress for your WQ.</div></div><hr />

Maybe. Myself, even before I used an addon, would scroll through pages and buy the first stack. And a lot of my friends did / do the same. I'd actually like to see the person who says - I'm lazy to click through the 36 pages, but I'll buy the 70 cloth I need one by one.

I'm using standard AH and macro to speed up buying out (basically buying out without confirmation). I can buy the entire page pretty fast. But my realm is not huge like Draenor, so each buyout takes few seconds to approve and entire page takes 1-2 minutes. Honestly, Auctionator is overhyped and it could do a better job without all those rescannings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're selling 2000 Tidespray Linen for 10g each.. you're selling 2000 Tidespray Linen for 10g each. Whether that's 10 stacks of 200 or 2000 stacks of 1 should not even be a question. It should simply be &quot;2000 x Tidespray Linen&quot;. And buyers should be able to buy any quantity from that, from 1 to 2000. <br />
<br />
Next step, allow people to set up buy orders for tradegoods. Now you've got a real market.<br />
<br />
That's too much common sense for them. If it took them this long to recognise a problem with 1 stack auction botters how long will it take for a proper market system.<br />

did you not read the change? you can still thing sell things 1 by 1 but it'll cost slightly more to list them<br />

also in the case of enchanting this change would be aimed at the dust and not the shards. only certain materials are being affected, things like Dust and Ore that you need in larger quantities</div></div><hr />

Should maybe just block people from selling stacks of 1 of popular trade goods, unless only 1 of said item is detected in the player's inventory. If someone wants to keep one for themselves and sell the other, then they could put any into bank they don't want to sell. Those who still want to sell stacks of 1 could just run back and forth, from bank to auction house.</div></div><hr />

From a players perspective I'd like it even better if they overhauled the AH to lump all items of a price into one and allow players to buy any number of them from the mega stack. First in, first sold. How many look at the seller name and would those few loosing out on that ability have any real negative effect?<br />
Sure your stack of 200 ore might get sold in stacks of 10, 50, 120 and 30 but would that really bother anyone? A few more mails or one delayed one for when all sold/expired.<br />
<br />
It also gives players an easier time starting out with AH playing as they can see what the current supply is and choose to undercut, price match or price above as it will likely sell later on.</div></div><hr />

FFS, asking for a permaban or a multi-month ban because some people found a way to get rep faster is absurd. Personally, as someone that only has 3 reps at revered and the others at honored, I don't think there should be a ban at all.<br />

Just knock their reps down to 0/21000 Revered or if they want to be harsh knock them to 0/6000 Friendly and farm the rep from scratch. Banning someone who loves WoW and plays it a ton for finding a way to farm rep faster is really dumb. <br />

FFS, asking for a permaban or a multi-month ban because some people found a way to get rep faster is absurd. Personally, as someone that only has 3 reps at revered and the others at honored, I don't think there should be a ban at all.<br />
<br />
Just knock their reps down to 0/21000 Revered or if they want to be harsh knock them to 0/6000 Friendly and farm the rep from scratch. Banning someone who loves WoW and plays it a ton for finding a way to farm rep faster is really dumb. <br />
<br />
Bans should be reserved for people who are being malicious or are affecting the game for other people. Banning people trolling the Auction House makes more sense than banning someone for farming rep faster than they should be.<br />
<br />
Disagree.<br />
<br />
1 - Boiled down its cheating and it is impactful to those that are competitive about their gameplay.<br />
2 - They don't love playing wow as much as you say, or they wouldn't cheat to bypass gameplay. Again, these are simply cheaters, nothing more.<br />
3 - This does affect the game for others * .<br />
<br />
* They gain better gear faster which can affect progression ranks ... it can affect the strength of people ganking ... they gain more gold and buy resources that might otherwise be available to the rest of us ... they gain extra resources that they then sell on the ah and depress prices that might otherwise have been higher ... and it just pisses people off cause, well basically, fuck anyone that is so shit at the game that they need to cheat.<br />
<br />
My two cents.</div></div><hr />

I remember from beta, people moaning leveling is too easy and they should make everything harder. How people want to feel like the world is 'dangerous' and need to group up etc. <br />
You'll get complaints either way, though I think most people actually like things being easier. That's why automated grouping tools are so popular - quests are a means to an end, not a lot of people like slogging through killing 250k life mobs (that scale) to suck some 15% progress for your WQ.<br />
<br />
People like things easier but then they like to complain things are to easy and wow is casual now.</div></div><hr />
