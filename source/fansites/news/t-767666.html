Achievements Changes<br />
A couple of beta achievements have been updated and some of the &quot;old&quot; achievements have been reverted to fit the 4.0.1 environment (you have to kill Thrall in Orgrimmar instead of Garrosh, etc ...). Blizzard is definitely polishing for live release. <br />

Spriests on beta were complaining about low DPS. Looks like you're winning on the fact that Blizzard listens to QQ! :D<br />
<br />
If the ETA is 5th October, then the PTR will go down tonight or tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbean</div><div class="date">2010-10-03, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">October 5th is 2 days, seems unlikely that they would deploy the release candidate to PTR only 2 days before the actual release. Too little time for testing and validation. 12th is more likely, so I'm going with that. :P<br />
<br />
Also, I really hope it's later than sooner. XD I don't want my classes (mainly Paladin) to change, so I'd have to learn them all over again. :'( I really like my Paladin right now lol.</div></div><hr />

Nice to see that the &quot;release&quot; patch is all buffs, and some pretty hearty ones! Instant PW:B seems to fit very well, as does the lowered cooldown on Prayer of Healing (easier to maintain its Chakra state). Atonement is a tiny tweak but its going to put it at just the right place. Shadowy Apparition is a little strange. People were noticing it already had pretty high DPS, so this is an unexpected change. I haven't done much testing as a shadow priest on the PTR, so that may have mostly been from multi-dotting Target Dummies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A blue said that they weren't going to overhaul the racials as they promised, most likely due to all the time spent on talents. Don't know why they promise things if they can't keep them. And don't they have many teams working on this stuff? Doesn't make any sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mhh i'm not so sure about that; &quot;ring of frost&quot; is a level 83 mage ability. why should they change it for 4.0.1 only, if we can never use it in 4.0.1?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I can tell, having just been on the PTR a few minutes ago, Overgrowth as a 2/2 talent spec in balance tree is gone.. yes.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Having tested entangling roots on the dummies in Ironforge.. I've noticed.. upon cast it's rooting both my target and the target dummy next to it now.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is they actually incorporated Overgrowth INTO regular entangling roots. Coupled with the newest change to the glyph of entangling roots what was previously 'reduces cast time by 100%&quot; to &quot;reduces cast time by 100% but increases cooldown by 10sec&quot; I think this would make actual sense for the cd now.</div></div><hr />

Although I would not complain if they did end up releasing it on the 5th as long as the patch is ready to go live. I am excited for all of the changes :) can't wait!</div></div><hr />

Since there is a paid Race Change Service now, it would probably cause more trouble with the community than benefits - forcing people to pay or reroll a new race for maximum damage is a dangerous game... And the new Races don't seem to be OP.</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding me? An extra disengage/rocket jump/rocket missle (goblin) or sprint (worgen) vs stoneform, a worthless PvP trinket 3 min CD racial that shares a CD with an ACTUAL PvP trinket, GoTN (lawl), or WoTF that also shares a CD with a PvP trinket? <br />

They are monstrously OP compared to the racials of current races. <br />

<br />
PTR 4.0.1 (13131) (Release)<br />
<br />
This means its done and can release on the next Maintenance day which is Tuesday Oct 5th, They don't need to extend it to give us a small patch to activate the others we downloaded. But if they do we will find out on the day or a day before if they extend it.<br />
<br />
And to the people saying its still buggy this and that don't work they are just issues to do with the PTR server, and if there still are a few bugs left over they can hotfix it. Also to add to this they do not need to wait till season 8 ends they already said they will nerf the damage if they have to in arenas but they don't see there being any issues since its ending in a week.</div></div><hr />

Basicly they switched positions on Skeleton Key and Workshop Key xD<br />
<br />
And about the changes to the Heirloom pieces, do you have a final answer on how much Justice Points you actually earn doing bosses? Since just because the emblem -&gt; point changes means you have lower than before won't mean that the bosses will give very little points</div></div><hr />

Im not on beta but from what I understand the best hunter spec is surv where you use only Black Arrow and spam Arcane Shot all the time... Cobra when out of focus. Makes me wonder if this is going live 0.o</div></div><hr />

Even if bosses will give good points, the 4.01 currency conversion will NOT allow you to purchase stuff with the old prices. So if you got 60 emblems for a specific item, after 4.01 you will need to grind more (a lot more, I may add) to obtain the same item. In any case... prices are goping up, it seems.</div></div><hr />

I thought that initially but then I read &quot;some of the old achievements have been reverted&quot;. The latest beta patch changed them to be kill garrosh etc, but thrall doesn't leave till 4.0.3, right? So the the change was 'reverted' back to kill thrall ;)<br />
Same thing with keymaster, it got removed in a beta build so was put back into the ptr build, or at least that's what I see happened.</div></div><hr />

Don't know about that experience thing but about release date of patch.... I am almost certain that it will not go live before the 12th october. The reason for this is the arena season. Last expansion, Burning Crusade, they made the misstake of having patch on live realms before seasons ends and there were so much inbalances in the arena the last week that it wasn't fun to play unless you played retri pala/retri pala in 2vs2.... if any of you remember.<br />
<br />
They probably don't want to make this misstake again.</div></div><hr />

I have to ask, where are the racial changes?<br />
I'm pretty sure they promised us that all races would get revamped racials...<br />
Or am I wrong?<br />
<br />
They said like 4-6 months back that they decided to only make minor changes to the racials and not completely overhaul them. Makes me sad too.</div></div><hr />

Get your Heirlooms before 4.01 or you will spend a ton of JPoints for them...<br />
<br />
The conversion rate from T / F Emblem to Point is 11.50. I'm sure the amount you get off bosses that would normally drop 1 badge are going to award more then 11.5 points. We may be looking in the range of 15 or 20 points instead. Harder bosses may give more points also.</div></div><hr />

No matter how many points we will get after 4.01, Heirloom gear seems to be insanely expensive. Using the currency conversion from JP to emblems we have a whooping <br />
<br />
Mail shoulders =&gt; 2175 JP =&gt; 188 emblems<br />
<br />
I don't think bosses will give hundreds of JP per kill.</div></div><hr />

I think 10 was just annoying, and allowing none to transform may be just as bad, due to your team having a chance to transform during the fight</div></div><hr />

Yes, but now they're not even remotely challenging. They're supposed to be achievements for doing something extra, not achievements for doing the boss</div></div><hr />

First, that's not how we crank up the numbers. Second, we are arguably the most awful PVP class so it makes sense for us to *at least* do a lot of damage in PVE. Otherwise no one would ever play the spec. Hardly anyone does anyway. I see 20 Mages per 1 Moonkin.</div></div><hr />

These posts just make me laugh, its the end of the world because roots no longer aoe everyone. Moonkins did fine already when it only did one, they will still be fine now. Natures grasp aoe root was just ridiculous, it already does 3 attackers but then on top of it it hits everyone near by.. yea much needed change.<br />
<br />
Also the reason players don't play boomkins isn't because of low dps they do fine. Its because they don't want to look like a chicken with downs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, the roots are now AoE baseline. No talents required. They break just as easily as ever, but they are AoE. Also, I've noticed that Lunar Shower Moonfire mana discount seems to be 33% per stack in this build, as the spell costs 6 mana at 3 stacks, which is not quite the 10% of 572 that the tooltip implies. So stop panicking and/or gloating, no nerfs today.<br />

An extra disengage/rocket jump/rocket missle (goblin) or sprint (worgen) vs stoneform, a worthless PvP trinket 3 min CD racial that shares a CD with an ACTUAL PvP trinket, GoTN (lawl), or WoTF that also shares a CD with a PvP trinket? <br />
<br />
They are monstrously OP compared to the racials of current races. <br />
<br />
&quot;kek look at me I haz +10 archaeologyZ! oh FACK wolfman chasin me! Better run! jk he has extra sprint. :((((&quot;<br />
<br />
Stoneform bad? U mad bro? This is one of the best racial for a rogue and not only.....Have you ever met a dorf rogue fulled up with bleeds by a feral,warr,rogue,MM hunt etc who was able to restealth the next second? Or as a DK have you fought a dorf class when you use 2 runes to apply your diseases and the next second they are all gone and have to waste 2 more runes?For a dwarf rogue vs. DKs and other rogues stoneform is a second CoS...what's not to love here?...oh did I mentioned it can be used while silenced? <br />
<br />
Shadowmeld....this is prolly the most OP racial for certain classes and also incredibly useful for all NEs,and I am going to list one example that happened to me(UD mage)/priest(partner)vs. ShS rogue(NE ofc)/affl lock at 2330 in blade's edge arena 2s : ...so,after like 2 mins of fight,cds burning,CC,trying to burst,survive etc,lock was under 20%,rogue a bit under 50%,they somehow,managed to take my priest under 25%( after a well timed DC+Spell Lock on me)then lock put Drain Soul on him bang bang,my priest dies....then I get out of silence with a lucky FoF proc still up,Deep Freeze the rogue and manage to finish the lock in a CS silence and FB+IL+hand rocket combo.At this point I was around 50% or a bit under(dots etc)with only 1 IB cd left and him with kinda the same HP and with 1 vanish and CoS(his timer got ready again)left...anyway,he gets out of deep freeze,I nova him he vanish then open me(sapped etc):ambush crit,backstab,5cp evisc and he brings me under 20% and eats the ice barrier was left on me,barrier freezes him,he CoS then I blink( we were under the bridge and I kinda blinked only 10 yds cause of a pillon)so he catches me with like 3 secs of CoS left and I had to IB,then I w8 4 Cos to wear off cancel IB,nova him run away a bit and ice barrier my ass again then I FB+IL combo crit his arsch and his cheat death procs(lol I know) then SURPRISE OF THE CENTURY: he SHADOWMELDS + restealth and Shadowstep saps me(extraordinary thinking cause doing so he avoided my blizzard aoe in the spot where he restealth) and ofc he bandaged his ass with me incapacitated and amazed looking at him then he restealth ambush crit,backstab,5cp evisc my barrier brakes and freeze him then he hand rocket+white throw me while I was trying to get a few steps away = me DEAD! QQQQ....YES,the tide turned just like that...I mean what were the odds he can win me with no cds left and slowed away????<br />
This was the most epic fight I lost as a frost mage vs a good rogue and was because of this racial(BASICALLY A SECOND VANISH IN PVP) and his perfect timing(tbh didn't even bother to consider it or to watch it's cd on Afflicted...)<br />
<br />
EDIT I : I want to overline that this isn't another &quot; amg a frost mage is complaining about rogues or melee,go ltp..&quot; QQ,NO!,first of all good geared and skilled ShS rogues have equal chances even vs OP frost mages ; vanish-like racials like SHADOWMELD in the hands of a good rogue can become very OP if well used and can turn the tide and second of all this isn't another &quot;amg horde dude complaining about allys racials when we all know horde have better&quot; reply either...in my heart I am a horde fan and wouldn't race change my UD mage or rogue for any actual or future racial,I still like them a lot even with the fairly weak post-nerf WOTF( is cause of the dance and casting animation,which are to epic :D )...all I am saying is why blizz let an ability like this with so much potential( BTW,you can also shadowmweld aka dodge incoming spells like frostbolts,lava bursts etc ,even incoming blinds...check some movies if you don't belive me)for some end game pvp-ers....at least those who know how to get the best of it are truly rare,so prolly that's why they don't bother to nerf it!<br />
<br />
EDIT II : My reply isn't about flaming you or others or QQ-ing...I was just listing a few examples and telling you that there are ACTUAL RACIALS better than the &quot;so called worgen sprint or goblin disengage&quot; if you know how and when to use them!<br />
<br />
PS: the gnome racial is also really powerful for every melee gnome who tries to rape a caster!<br />

Don't know why they promise things if they can't keep them. And don't they have many teams working on this stuff? Doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
Yeah! It's not like they added thousands of new quests, overhauled multiple classes, implemented new features, abilities, dungeons, and talents, or completely changed two entire continents, right?<br />

Oh wait.<br />

No matter how many points we will get after 4.01, Heirloom gear seems to be insanely expensive. Using the currency conversion from JP to emblems we have a whooping <br />
<br />
Mail shoulders =&gt; 2175 JP =&gt; 188 emblems<br />
<br />
I don't think bosses will give hundreds of JP per kill.<br />
<br />
To anyone not currently aware the five man heroic bosses are currently dropping either 15 or 16 justice points a piece.</div></div><hr />

And they didn't change two entire continents. They changed like 50-60% of the continents, something that should have been free especially with how old this game is. But WoW players are like crack addicts. They'll pay anything.</div></div><hr />

Paladins have trouble AOE tanking as well. It was an across the board nerf.<br />

They arent destroying any class. They just dont want AOE zerg instances<br />

Yes, I'm not really sure why people kept repeating the &quot;possible 5th&quot; date once blizzard announced that Season 8 will end no sooner than the 12th.<br />
<br />
4.0 will not go live before Season 8 is over. Really, it's unlikely it will even go live until a week after Season 8 is over. Sort of a weird miss on that, to have so many keep posting the &quot;5th or 12th&quot; speculation.</div></div><hr />

I find it funny how warriors are all QQing and yet paladins are in a worse state at the last time I tested. It was basically &quot;if you aren't druid or dk gtfo or respec healing/dps&quot; <br />

Good news, druid is almost 80 and dk is 80.<br />

Oh and to people that think they will somehow cause a difference by canceling your account. Blizz doesn't give a crap if you cancel or not. It is a 15 dollar drop in a million dollar bucket. You won't be missed one little bit. Sure their share of the mmo market is down from 60+% to 54%, but you know what that little 6% mean virtually nothing to blizz. They have more than enough money to ignore it. This isn't sarcasm, it's just the truth. I will give you a real world example. Do you think Phlip Morris (makes of molboro etc) give a damn if you think &quot;tobacco is evil&quot;? Hell no they don't. If you stop smoking that is fine, they will even pay for the stop smoking adds. Because for everyone that stops smoking there is another who isn't and likely another that will pick it up. In the end they have made enough money off it so that is not another cig sold ever, they could still sleep on a bed of cash and burn it for fun. So just stop with the threats to cancel your account. None of us care, and blizz doesn't care either.</div></div><hr />

Tell that to the Age of Conan people who thought they could do whatever they wanted and 'ignored the QQ'rs.&quot; <br />

I don't know what Blizz hopes for their own future, but with stuff like SWTOR coming out they may want to rethink their customer retention strategy.<br />

Agree about the whining, but not about 'they are after all market leaders'. I'd rather go to a good restaurant then to McDonalds, so to speak. Ok, I think WoW is a good restaurant, but market share alone doesn't make something the best game.</div></div><hr />

Do you actually think that the rankings in an arena season is enough to postpone an entire expansion 1 or 2 weeks. Think again sunshine, your shot at getting a title/mount is not that important.</div></div><hr />

It's not the expansion though, it's the pre-expansion patch, and yes the arena season is important enough to postpone that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its not. Going from BC to LK: Blizzard implemented class changes prior to finishing the ongoing arena season. Good players still got their titles/rewards. <br />
Edit: besides the schedule for the patches up to Cataclysm are interconnected, if 4.01 gets delayed so does 4.03 and so Cataclysm will also be delayed.</div></div><hr />

The game would surely be in a better place if players didn't point out flaws, they were blind followers, and when you hit reply if automatically did your post for you. Something like &quot;X is SOOOooo AmaZing. Blizzard are teh best&quot;.<br />
<br />
Market leaders doesn't mean a thing. Atari was a market leader at one point, then Nintendo, then Sony, now you have it basically being a toss up between Sony, Nintendo, and MS. So yeah, market leaders can fall, and they usually come crashing down, not a slow decline.</div></div><hr />
