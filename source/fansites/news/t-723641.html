I have experience only on Hunters / Warlocks / Warriors / Mages / Rogues. The other classes... well, let's say I know nothing about the talent trees and skills. Is this the reason I suck at not understanding arena movies?</div></div><hr />

If you anywhere near serious about pvp you should read up everything about every class. Watching these vid's can help you to understand what maybe this comp might do to your team, etc... <br />
<br />
I don't understand why people complain about them being on the front page. This is a WoW website, why not link one of the ONLY things going on in the WoW universe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah ok, i figured he was someone important in arenas, and i think i rememebr hearing teh name at some old tournaments.<br />
Thanx man:P its was bugging me.<br />
<br />
Its sucks that they are having all the technical difficulties i actually paid for the HD stream so i could watch it on my couch but the action is so few and far between is ridiculous, they REALLY need to work on the time management aspect of there web-casts. At least have some sexy a$$ girls interviewing The other teams that aren't preparing to play about the upcoming match or about where they are from or there size of there Gfs bewbs....SOMETHING!!!!! OR they could actually SHOW some of the clips form teh WOW arena videos they keep talking about, i mean they have talked about Woundmans vids 50 times now but they have showed no clips.....That would be a great way to fill time, play Arena videos that are bad ass and talk about them while we wait. Then they just shut the coverage off..... it just seems silly. They could put out a bad ass product with just a bit of work and forethought but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....:P</div></div><hr />

Yes, and every one tells every one else not to pee in the pool even though they all secretly are doing just that. They spend a lot on water treating chemicals.</div></div><hr />

If you're interested in PvP these circuits a very very fun to watch when they aren't failing at the stream. These make you into a better pvp player hands down.</div></div><hr />

Well yeah exactly, I'm just saying because there's pages here of people whining about how bad the quality is or whatever.<br />

I thought there was a finnish and german PvP team that was supposed to be S..T hot.. I assume either they were not invited or they considered it too expensive to compete in it (flights etc)<br />
<br />
Will there be a Best of the world, world tournment in Europe?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yiska</div><div class="date">2010-06-05, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of things to note:<br />
<br />
- There were massive sound difficulties which caused the delay. Those should be resolved by today.<br />
<br />
- There is no European WoW team because there are about three more sponsored teams in Europe, one of which being Dignitas (Hydra's team). He had exams and went on vacation afterwards and that's why they aren't there this weekend. All other WoW teams were asked (they had 2 more open slots) and it's just that the European top is currently in a pre summer hole and that many European top players haven't even found a viable comp to play in at this point in time. Also teams consistently doing well on TR should be more vocal so people like me can promote them and eventually get sponsored :)<br />
<br />
- Today will have a huge amount of games. They most likely won't be able to afford too long delays<br />
<br />
- The adverts you see aren't created for games specifically. Some of them (like Doritos) used to run during Superbowl. <br />
<br />
- I'm not an MLG admin/consultant/wizard, I'm just a knowledgeable viewer :P<br />
<br />
- By playing in pools, they mean that they have two groups of 7 teams. Everyone who watched the MLG events last year with the round robin model (8 teams playing eachother, top 4 emerges to the double elim.) knows how many games are played and streamed. While they probably won't show too much of the local teams (furreal for example), they will try to stream as much as possible. <br />
<br />
- Hydramist.net live blogs about the games and puts up short recaps with a little flavor and a lot of honesty :) (Shameless advert)</div></div><hr />
