<br />
<br />
How is it lame? you knew it was coming, its going to go to 25% and then up to a maximum of 30% are you going to constantly post the word &quot;lame&quot; every time they come out further wasting your time, or are you trying to troll? :/ <br />
<br />
And to Betrayer, it stops at 30% so probably in 2 more months. = LK 10 should be puggable by that i mean killing the LK which is good, because i enjoy pugging .....yes i'm a casual ....*gets glares from all the elitists* ..... o.o</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, and the DPS take damage too on some fights. Perhaps you could try healing them? Why do I get the feeling that you aren't even a healer.<br />

<br />
i have gotten to the blood princes but that is about it...i can pretty much one heal the place....and we havent turned off the buff...hmm never mind ignore me.<br />

EDIT: Yes i am a healer i am shammy healer and yes i heal the DPS tyvm....we two heal everything but when all of my heals are just over heal its a waste of mana personally... but w/e choose not to believe that i am a healer.</div></div><hr />

wow...just because i am NOT a hard core raider doesnt mean i dont care about what goes on in that place...i happen to love raiding and i do care justt because i havent beaten up the Linch King doesnt mean we arent a good grp of pple...we havent progressed because pple ARENT showing up for my raids cause they actually have lives outside of the game...i guess its a crime to have a life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Turn the buff off then?<br />
<br />
Obviously, if you're complaining about the buff trivializing the game and you aren't 11/12 - you still need it. There's more than a handful of guilds on my server that raid 2 days a week and are at least 8/12 heroic.<br />
<br />
Casual isn't an excuse for being bad. That's 2 entirely different groups of people.<br />
<br />
With these series of nerfs - you have an option. UNLIKE in BC where it was a flat 30% that you couldn't change. Now, they let you turn it off, and it's apparently just as bad.<br />
<br />
Fucking remarkable.</div></div><hr />

Absorption bubbles also get the 20% increase as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

I've said before that it'd be perfect if they allowed you to turn on the buff, but you don't gain any achievements under that buff. <br />

So it's like practice for mechanics.</div></div><hr />

You really shouldn't need more than that. It takes around 4 hours to do 20 attempts on heroic LK (more if you're progressing further in the fight, and less if you're wiping within 1-2 minutes).</div></div><hr />

Anyone saying &quot;Lame&quot; or whatever --- I laugh at you. The buff is completely optional, and I'd pay to see you in a screenshot killing LK HM without the buff. Otherwise, you're just like 100% of the Guilds in the world that needed some sort of buff to progress all the way through. <br />

<br />
Or how about compare them to what they really should be compared to, heroic Sindragosa or Putricide. No, they shouldn't have the option to do 5/10/15 or whatever % you want because 1 in 1000 guilds might actually consider doing it, the rest don't care and use it or don't. They've got better things to work on. Also, please enlighten us how allowing more people to see content is bad in any way possible. If you've done it you've done it and shouldn't care, if you haven't you should be glad this will help you slightly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JackBauerLOL</div><div class="date">2010-05-25, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real problem with this buff is that you can't lower it. It's at 20% or nothing. Soon, ICC heroic will either be trivial (30%) or too hard for the majority of guilds.<br />
<br />
But oh well who cares about ICC anyway? ToC was destined to suck soon as we heard about it so no surprise there, ICC should've been better than Ulduar. Instead we get 10 unknown bosses, Sindragosa (probably worst fight this expansion due to mechanics) and Lich King with a cliche ending.<br />
<br />
For what it could've been, ICC was a complete failure.</div></div><hr />

Fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
I bet 40979 out of the 41037 guilds who raid would very much disagree with you. Only 58 guilds have killed heroic mode lich king with 15% buff, you honestly 30% will get a good amount of them the kill? Lich King heroic mode will still be extremely rare for players to obtain, 30% buff alone does not get you the kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why? Because you're too &quot;proud&quot; to accept the fact that the fight was more difficult than your Guild (for whatever reasons, absolutely not insulting ANYONE here, we've all been there/done that) could manage without some assistance?<br />
<br />
People try way too hard to feel special in this game. Hint: If your name didn't appear on the front page here, one could argue your kills were &quot;meaningless&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's all in how you look at it. It's still a difficult instance on HM25 for our Guild. We have people coming and going because Blizzard likes to force people to see the same bosses 4 (ToC) or 2 (Naxx, Uld, Ony/VoA, ICC) times a week.</div></div><hr />

What I mean is the threat generated from tanks is not scaling as fast as dps with each 5%. Since tank abilities use threat modifiers more than threat from damage.</div></div><hr />

If they can't handle an overall raid DPS increase of 20% from there normal raids overall DPS, then they shouldn't tank.</div></div><hr />

Sunwell was still moderately difficult, even after the 30% HP nerfs and introduction of WoTLK talents (though of course, nothing like it was originally).<br />

As a previous poster stated, how many players have killed heroic Sindragosa, Putricide, and LK? Oh right only 58 guilds have done all three so far and only 2.84% have done Sindrgosa and Putricide. These buffs in no way make these encounters that much easier that the average raider is going to be able to down them. If you're going to compare shit at least make valid points and compare similar encounters.</div></div><hr />

Something tells me you have yet to even set foot in the Upper Spire, let alone tank. Not to mention not every player is at an equal level of skill.</div></div><hr />

You're kidding right? Case in Point: for any non-retarded guild p1 m'uru went from a 5 minute ordeal of just staying ahead of the adds to everyone burn the hell out of m'uru before more than one wave of adds spawns or he can use any other abilities and then kill entropius in half the time while blood lusted. Oh yeah, the whole time in p2 you're OTing the adds from p1 because killing them is a waste of time.<br />
<br />
The other fights in the instance? Even easier than that. Sunwell was a complete and utter joke after the nerfs.<br />

Good luck finding a guild that'll go with you on that. I personally wouldn't mind doing 10m HM LK without the buffs but there's no way in hell I'd be able to convince the rest of my group to go a long with it. Pull head out of ass and come up with better retort.</div></div><hr />

5% every month is way too fast? Not to mention how many guilds have been at 11/12 heroic modes since heroic modes were even available, around the time of the 10% buff 2 months ago? I'm sorry but the last thing that these guilds are having an issue with is obtaining heroic gear.</div></div><hr />

The guilds that are that good are I bet still not in full 3rd level T10 gear, and when they get to that point they would get it. Those guilds are good enough to not need the buff anyway.

<br />
So you're saying guilds that have done most of the heroic mode for nearly 3 months now won't have all the heroic items they need? I seriously beg to differ there. Honestly gear isn't the real difference in doing these modes are not, it's the players. There's a reason the majority of top 100 guilds cleared all but the end bosses the first week if not the first few days heroics were available while the rest of us struggled to clear normal modes, and it certainly isn't gear. If one month isn't enough time for you to progress on an encounter with an additional 5% then you'll likely not do it anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The achievement system is really undervalued, obviously you know that your achi's are dated... So why get so grumpy when &quot;scrubs&quot; get it? The armory clearly shows that you got it before the &quot;scrubs&quot;, it will clearly show your skill as the date reflects (potentially) what buff % you had when you got the first kill. Not to mention WowProgress.com will show what your guild has already achieved and when. :)<br />

First off that's not saying much, given there's been a grand total of TWO expansions for WoW...<br />
<br />
Second, everybody throwing their eyes back towards BC and Vanilla sound like sad pitiful losers reminiscing over the times they had with their Ex-GF. You remember all the fun times you had and conveniently forget all of the things that ended the relationship...BC (or Vanilla for that matter) wasn't anywhere near perfect. It had class imbalances galore that make the ones today seem fair, shitty itemization, cartoon armor, talents were all screwed and Blizzard didn't even know what most of the classes should be doing (Shamans, tanking because horde don't have Pallies? Really? Have fun in that mail armor).<br />
<br />
Case in point, you really sound pathetic.</div></div><hr />

You should be in school, boy. Your attempts at answering him has caused all who try to read it pain.<br />
<br />
And in response to your &quot;casual&quot; bashing, some people work 60+ hour weeks to feed their families and pay their mortgages. They pay for the game just like your parents do for you, they can play however they want ESPECIALLY if Blizzard is making it more accessible for those kinds of people to do so.<br />
<br />
So unless you want to convince Blizzard to go another direction, or make your own MMO that magically rivals WoW, shut the hell up.</div></div><hr />

Removal of the buff forces bad players to learn their classes.<br />
Now everyone can stroll in and smash buttons and when harder content comes out they completely whipe raids again :/</div></div><hr />

This isn't entirely true, because as stated it doesn't do the encounters for you it simply makes them slightly easier. People will still wipe to stupid mistakes and this buff may help slightly it's not going to miraculously make you down a difficult encounter that you've not even come close to defeating. <br />
<br />
Secondly though, why should 'skill' be rewarded by gear anymore? Titles and drakes are what skill gets you now, not the best gear in the game. If that isn't sufficient enough for you then you're playing the wrong game. <br />
<br />
Lastly, I really don't see how this encourages less effort at all... sure the better guilds can slack with the buff but if you need it to progress, which all but 58 guilds do right now, then you're not really putting in less effort. Just because you have lesser skilled players doesn't mean you don't give as much effort. I could wipe to heroic LK every week since it's been available and have used all my attempts and I'm giving as much effort as someone who's downed it if not more effort.</div></div><hr />

You have the time for signing up on forums just for this post, but not the time to turn the buff off right? If you dont like it dont use it.. Other than that it isnt your concern what other ppl do.. If you think only Hardcore raiders should see LK death, there is Heroic version of LK as well - go kill it. This buff + this heroic version system provides a wide variety of ppl to see end game content which they &quot;paid&quot; for... Also if hardcore raiders wants to Show off that they have &quot;too much free time&quot;.. ehm skills i mean on killing Heroic LK, there are lots of achievements/rewards for it that they can still show off</div></div><hr />

ICC has been out for 6 months.<br />
<br />
Why are people saying &quot;this is too fast&quot; when, in the grand scheme of things, it's been out a REALLY long time?<br />
<br />
The progression aspect hasn't gone anywhere. If you weren't able to down a certain boss before the buff and you're able to now, you're still downing a boss you haven't downed before... <br />

<br />
All jokes aside I think this buff has really helped my guild a lot. We're 11/12 normal modes right now, we have some very good players in the guild, like maybe 5-8 or so. The rest are only average or bad. We're one of those guilds that has attendance issues sometimes and that (along with low dps from our lower end players) really hurts our progression. Without the zone wide buff, we might still be stuck on blood queen.<br />
<br />
I feel like with this incarnation of the buff we have a really solid chance of downing the LK and moving into some of the easier hardmodes. Personally, for me, this buff has made my raiding experience a lot better.</div></div><hr />

OFC I dont like it, but tell me can you or even Paragon Kill LK with 0% buff, ofc not<br />
5% buff = Paragon<br />
10% buff = top 3<br />
15% buff = top 60<br />
20% buff = probably top 150+<br />
25% buff = probably 400+<br />
<br />
Try plaing Saufrang with 0% buff and then try it with 20%, even Ulduar bosses are harder then Saufrang with 20% buff in ICC 25 man HC<br />
( 0% buff= hard mode, 10%buff= funny mode, 20% buff= lol mode )<br />
you have 2 options: <br />
Buff off = fucking hell raid<br />
Buff on = not even lol mode<br />
<br />
yea give 20%+ buff for ICC normal and semi casul guilds, dont do that for core guilds and core players and HC mode<br />
Is it fun kill something with 20% nerf ? ITS NOT</div></div><hr />

I doubt we'll see more than a few hundred kills even with 30% buff. It won't save you from slow defile placements, shoddy vile spirit soaking or bad movement in the Frostmourne room.</div></div><hr />

YOu're looking at it from percentage to percentage. A flat out 5% increase stays a 5% increase. Going from 105 to 110 might be a 4.76% increase but the true value is just 10% from 100 and so on :)</div></div><hr />

I believe this is so wrong, since the game was balance for 100% and for each percent of buffs you deviate from balance a lot and makes survivability from damages and dps needed on limited time invervals (adds / phases) sooooooo much easier. So each step really makes things easier, dont you see how easier it has become for ppl to stay alive and how pressure on healers is declining on each round of buffs SIGNIFICANTLY</div></div><hr />

Sure this buff brings alot of mixed reactions for a large base of players, all changes will bring this change, instead of flaming eachother just let it be.<br />
<br />
From my opinion, I welcome these buffs, I am not an elitist, though the 'elitist' has got to admit, they NEED these buffs too, If not, Turn it off and do whatever it is that you're doing so you can please yourself. Blizzard stated on WOTLK beta as well as prior to releasing it, that they want to make content accessible, I don't see how pugs getting to LK / killing him months have you have will alter your game play, maybe you'll be unhappy that you tried harder with 0% or 5% to get what they have and you feel they don't deserve it, by all means think that if you want, let your ego take over you.<br />
<br />
And No I'm not a 'complete' baddie, No i have yet to get anywhere inside ICC10, I am apart of a 10m only guild. We raid 2 hours a week, 1 day a week, sometimes 2 hours on another day. <br />
Yes i have killed LK10 on normal, with the 10% buff, wiped on 14% with 5% buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why these buffs are good, It allows people to advance into ICC. <br />
<br />
Why these buffs are bad, it effectively makes dramatic changes as everything will become easier for those who know the strat but tend to die from a random tank death or to enrage timers.<br />
<br />
How come these buffs cater to casuals? Simply by boosting stats (health, dmg, healing, absorption) it will allow for greater margin of errors.<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG NOW BADDIES WILL GET LK&quot; &quot;Kingslayer is the new jenkins!&quot;<br />
<br />
The above statements are simply false. If baddies are indeed baddies (definition : Players who have absolutely no sense of raid awareness nor know anything about their class). They will still ice block the entire raid on sindra due to failing raid awareness, they will not swap to oozes on PP or kite the gas cloud, they will not bite dps classes to become vampires, they will still fail on empowered flame orbs (though the damage on normal is trivial with the nerfs), They will still wipe to dreamwalker because they're not killing the proper adds or aren't healing VD fast enough, They will still die on rotface slime spray / big ooze going through melees, Festergut will still 2 shot bad tanks or groups with bad healers), Players will ignore adds for some reason on LDW.<br />
<br />
Saurfang really is a no brainer, I'm not sure how people can wipe on it. Same as Gunship. If people are wiping on marrowgar normal they shouldn't bother raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Heroic ICC, even with buffs players WILL still have trouble, only when its certain bosses are on farm then the buff makes it trivial. I don't see how baddies will be able to do heroic festergut (with dmg increase/enrage timer is tight if people fail on mallable goo), Professor is an execution fight not a mindless zerg.<br />
<br />
I can go on but obviously this is just a wall of text now, i apologise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious, hope that makes sense &gt;__&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Paragon downed Heroic LK (25M) with 5% i think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this buff also for, lets say, normal 10 man icc? Or maybe 25 man normal icc?<br />
<br />
Thank you :)</div></div><hr />

Can't kill a boss? Walk around in your charity epics till the majority of your raid has wiped so many times on a boss that the tactics are BURNED into your thick skulls.<br />
Turn off the dam buff for everyone and let scrubs stay scrubs forever.<br />

Unless you've downed or come close to killing LK on 25 Heroic, you have absolutely no room to QQ about the buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I haven't downed LK HC yet, I've attempted it at 15%, and I can say that I still think it's lame with 20% more dmg/absorbs/hp/healing, I think you should be able to change it to what percentage fits you best, 15% was pretty good actually.<br />
<br />
Am I right?</div></div><hr />

for their own accomplishment from others to raise their self-esteem, rather than just compete with themselfs, cause the fact is none else cares<br />
than for their own accomplishments, are you doing it for the gz on server first? then that's pretty much what people will say just, that guild was<br />
server first and carry on, even I have forgot who got LK normal first kill on my server, and farming 11/12 25hc every week and maybe get the LK<br />
down finally, I dont really care what others have or have done.<br />
<br />
and the Kingslayer title has been the new jenkins for a long time, people have payed to get it so.</div></div><hr />

Some guild(guilds?) was working on it prior to buff werent they? <br />
Give them some time to get fully icc25 hc geared and one of the top guilds prolly do it sooner or later without the 5% buff and Rogue rotation saronite bombs or whatever was used for world first kill;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand why Blizz couldn't just let you talk to Garrosh/Varian and choose a specific buff. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe they will in cataclysm for the buffs there (because I can see this system working out)<br />
<br />
And then ppl will say<br />
<br />
-&quot;Too many options&quot;<br />
-&quot;lame&quot;<br />
-&quot;What is the point of options, everyone will chose the highest anyhow&quot;<br />
-Cataclysm ruined the game..remember how epic ICC was?&quot;<br />

Yeah, paying for stuff has been done ever since the Amani Bears. I am pretty sure somebody claimed already the game was ruined back then....</div></div><hr />

We can due to this cool, cool buff :D<br />

Why would anyone do that or even care? paragons 5% kill with their gear level at that time was harder than a 0% kill is for most guilds now.</div></div><hr />

The main difficulty with this encounter is the Val'kyr phase. Non-optimal handling of defile or use of cooldowns is still going to wipe a raid. Yes, the phase is shortened due to the increased damage. And the DPS requirement on the Val'kyr is a little easier to satisfy. These things do help, but they are not game changing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you prefer they, let's say, reduced the amount of Malleable goo getting thrown out on Putricide, or made the BQL Shroud do less damage, instead of giving us this buff?</div></div><hr />

Instead of nerfing the fights, they could have made a hard and an easy version of each boss. Oh wait...</div></div><hr />

Is this irony on a high level or trolling on a very low one?<br />
<br />
First post, too..we may have a lot of good times with this one. Oh..and btw..unless YOU are a member of Paragon and thus part of the only guild who managed to kill LK heroic with the 5% buff - you are also apparently a scrub...You are the 10% scrub...some are the 15% scrubs..and now we get the 20% ones....</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were planning on extending our raid ID for our heroic run so that we can go straight to Sindy/Proff this week rather than doing all the other guys first and carrying on where we left off with about 38 attempts left.<br />
<br />
Will we get the extra 5 attempts added (ie - have 43 attempts left) or do we need to let it reset to get those?</div></div><hr />
