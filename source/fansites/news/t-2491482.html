Deciding to close several of the Curse community websites wasn’t an easy decision for our company, but we could no longer justify the substantial engineering resources it took to run the properties. No one in our office wanted to see MMO-Champion shut down, so we carefully searched for a solution. <br />
<br />
We are happy to announce that we have been able to identify a company with the necessary experience to buy and run these sites (including MMO-Champion), so that the passionate communities will continue to have homes on these long-standing sites. With this, we have started to transfer the sites to Magic Find. As for the staff on these sites, it will be up to them and Magic Find to decide how they’d like to move forward.<br />
<br />
It’s a new and exciting beginning for MMO-Champion. We wish Magic Find the best as we say goodbye to several of the properties that helped our company grow into what it is today.<br />
<br />
This will be the last update from Curse/Fandom. All future communications will be from the new site owner.</div></div><hr />

When you posted that, the site wasn't even owned by Curse. It had already been sold twice at that point.<br />
<br />
Twitch bought Curse, including MMOC in 2016. Fandom bought the site as part of a package of websites from Twitch in January 2019. However, they were only interested in a few of those sites and MMOC wasn't one of them. MMOC is now in hands of people who care about it and want to keep it running.</div></div><hr />

MMO-C has an incredible amount of traffic going into WoD... and then the site took the biggest hit in activity throughout the following year. It recovered somewhat with Legion but never attained WoD level's of traffic, and then BFA happened which was also a massive hit. Fortunately, MMO-C has been running for long enough that while many of its users have lost interest in WoW, they're still ingrained enough to come back to talk about other things on the other forums. Most of my friends here aren't even subbed to WoW anymore; they come to post on the FFXIV subforum, the video games subforum, cinema, fun stuff, chat zone, and so on.</div></div><hr />

Curse Network has been in the process of shutting down all of their community sites / forums, starting not long after they got acquired by Fandom.<br />
<br />
They're &quot;shifting focus,&quot; though damned if anyone seems to know what they're doing other than D&amp;DBeyond. It seems to me like Gamepedia is being run by Fandom Games now, the official Curse website and social media presence are basically dead, and last I heard, most of the people running these sites were left in the dark until the decision to shut them down was made.</div></div><hr />

How can anyone make money on unofficial forum for games that you did not create? The only difference between this forum and some other forum that is less popular is that it looks flashy and people here are vastly worse.<br />

This definitely could help, but not likely. This is the first time I even peeked at the website in weeks and the first time I have commented in I don't even know how long. The Liberal snowflakes that infest these boards and moderate them made this comment section the worst I have ever seen. But I have also quit wow and so far have no intention of playing again. So even if it does improve, I probably won't see it. This all just isn't very surprising at all. You get what you deserve.</div></div><hr />

I can argue that its most often &quot;You get what others serve you which you can either accept or not.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Will we have to do another account transfer like when fandom bought us?<br />
<br />
Don't feel this is about BFA tbh, Fandom / Curse has been closing websites left and right. <br />
<br />
Stuff that has been closed from the list of sites sold to fandom:<br />
<br />
diablofans.com<br />
forums.zybez.net<br />
gwentdb.com<br />
hearthpwn.com<br />
minecraftforum.net<br />
mtgsalvation.com<br />
nbalive.gg<br />
symthic.com<br />
azurilland.com<br />
arenajunkies.com<br />
<br />
Looks like they closed like 75% of the websites they bought from Twitch.</div></div><hr />

Well, time to delete the account after 10 years.<br />

I'm not sure who runs the MagicFind account, but I assume it;s one of the new guys. Chaud is not going anywhere.</div></div><hr />

I think you will find &quot;Since the crazy political ranting twats on both sides infested it&quot; is the actual and correct statement here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only major forum I know of that allows it, and basically has turned the whole thing into a shitfest.</div></div><hr />

So now we're going to blame libs for the slow decline of a fansite based on slowly declining IPs...kay.<br />
<br />
<br />
If MMO-C wanted to stay relevant it would've given a bigger platform to other MMO's than WoW, I think. FF certainly seems to be rising.</div></div><hr />
