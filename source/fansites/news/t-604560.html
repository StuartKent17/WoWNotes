2.4 Notes - when it's done<br />
This is your daily dose of 2.4 non-information, Blizzard is working on it but you won't know anything about it until the release.<br />
I think people would get tired of hearing &quot;not today&quot; and start asking &quot;when?&quot; Then I'd have to answer with &quot;soon&quot; and it would just go on from there.<br />
<br />
Things are in the works, the cogs are moving, and we'll get there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 2 Gear available for honor<br />
For the moment, Blizzard still plan to make the season 2 gear available for honor once the season 4 has started. They also plan to simply remove the season 1 gear and if you've got way too many honor points and like collecting things, you might want to buy it now. <br />
Q: With the launch of Season 3 for arena's, Season 1 gear became available for honor. My question is - when Season 4 starts, will Season 2 gear be available ... [for honor?]<br />
A: That's the plan Stan. (Subject to change)<br />
<br />
It means that Season 1 gear will no longer be available. Season 2 will take its place on the honor vendors for the same price that Season 1 gear is now.<br />
A: This is, also, the plan... Stan. Also not set in stone at the moment, but that's been the idea from the start. New season sets cycle in, the old ones are sloughed off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warsong Gulch modifications<br />
Some of the matches played in Warsong Gulch are ridiculously long, and aren't really fun. Blizzard agrees and will try to change it in the future.<br />
We agree, and while it's nothing we could discuss now in any detail, there have been some different ideas tossed around and tested internally that would attempt to address those same concerns. Given that, these aren't changes that are likely to surface soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
European realms - Recent latency<br />
Thundgot posted another post on official forums about the high latency affecting some realms, especially in battlegrounds.<br />
Over the last few weeks, different issues have caused latency on some of our realms and cross-realm Battlegrounds (CRBGs), especially the Blackout, Bloodlust and Cataclysme Battlegroups. While most of the issues have already been resolved through our work with our service provider partners, we are aware that some latency issues are still affecting these Battlegroups, and to a lesser degree some other Battlegroups.<br />
<br />
We have implemented a workaround to alleviate some of the CRBG latency at peak hours and are working diligently on a permanent solution. We will update you on the matter as soon as we have new information available.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is your favorite 5 person dungeon from The Burning Crusade?<br />
There is a poll running on european forums asking players about their favorite 5-man instance. Caverns of Time instances are winning the poll by far, with respectively 42.05% and 19.51% for the Old Hillsbrad Foothills and The Black Morass, it's also interesting to see what are the instances that absolutely nobody wants to play (like the Auchenai Crypts). <br />
It could be the atmosphere, the story, the challenge or the loot itself, but no matter what everybody has a favourite dungeon. Of the 5 person dungeons released in The Burning Crusade what is your favourite?<br />
<br />
Favorite instance<br />
1. CoT: Old Hillsbrad Foothills (42,05%)<br />
2. CoT: The Black Morass (19,51%)<br />
3. Hellfire Citadel: The Shattered Halls (6,34%)<br />
4. Auchindoun: Shadow Labyrinth (5,27%)<br />
5. Hellfire Citadel: Hellfire Ramparts (5,17%)<br />
<br />
Least favorite instance<br />
1. Auchindoun: Auchenai Crypts (0,49%)<br />
2. Auchindoun: Sethekk Halls (1,07%)<br />
3. Auchindoun: Mana-Tombs (1,46%)<br />
4. Coilfang Reservoir: The Slave Pens (1,46%)<br />
5. Hellfire Citadel: The Blood Furnace (2,05%)<br />

New Wallpaper - Barkskin<br />
We just added a new wallpaper to our World of Warcraft wallpapers section. This wallpaper features some amazing artwork from the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game. Head over to the Upper Deck Entertainment website now to learn more about the game, see more art, or even download some demo decks:<br />
http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/ (http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/en/)<br />
<br />
This new wallpaper features a mysterious night elf druid, poised for the strike. The artwork is taken from the Barkskin card, a card which is used to prevent ability, ally, and equipment cards from being interrupted.<br />

<br />
Ayyy. Sounds nice, yarr!<br />
*drinks his coffee*<br />
<br />
Okay, I just read the S2-for-honor-part again.<br />
Whats the sense of doing this? All the instances get worthless farming, everyone just wants to push his char to 70 to farm AV and equipp him with S2...<br />
Thats not worth it.<br />
It's ruin the game, this whole Arenaset farming.<br />
We could see that with the S1 for honor part.<br />
I'm pissed off all the leechers, farmers, Arena geared alts and the rare instance groups, especially with my holypriest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hegarol</div><div class="date">2008-01-30, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most hated instance?<br />
<br />
I am sorry but that doesn't make sense. Because an instance is not THE favorite for most of the players its not automatically the &quot;most hated instance&quot;.<br />
Lets give you an example: You got 3 instances and 3 people.<br />
Guy 1: 1.Place: Instance A ; 2.Place: Instance B ; 3.Place: Instance C<br />
Guy 2: 1. Instance C ; 2. Instance B ; 3. Instance A<br />
Guy 3: 1. Instance A ; 2. Instance B ; 3. Instance C<br />
<br />
Instance A is clearly the favorite of the three. But just because Instance B is not picked from anyone as THE favorite doesn't make it the most hated. Two guys voted Instance C last place so THAT would be the most hated Instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is not that Season 2 arena set is available for honor.<br />
The probleme is that we can use bg/arena set in PvE (opposite is also true, but less likely to happen except for some weapon like twin blades of azinoth)</div></div><hr />

Amen for that!<br />
Nobody is raiding nowdays, doing instances, RPing (well, doing most of stuff that they were doing before merciless came into the game). It looks like the game is all about PvP now, free epics, and ownage.<br />
If you got full vengefull (probably merciless-set) and PvP &quot;trash&quot; - you'll probably own all the players. No skills required!<br />
<br />
Anyways, it looks like Blizzard wants to keep up the game and &quot;feed&quot; players with new PvP seasons before the expansion? ???</div></div><hr />

Who ever thought a mid range instance with the first room containing add summoners AND MCers that always MC the tank was clearly out to make an instance that people do once then skip... for the love of god, AVOID! <br />

One is just currently able to be done afk with a not-big-enough chance of being banned.<br />
<br />
Arena items should be left to arena, and you shouldn't have to grind for them, it should be a level playing field that comes down to tactics/classes instead of gear.<br />
Skilled teams being the only one with access to better items just means they can be less skillful when facing a team without the better items yet.<br />
The news post about the new tournament realm showed that tournament people REALLY won't take wow serious as a pvp game unless there is a place where everyone is equal, just turn all of arena into something like this (obviously too big of a project before expansion though).<br />
<br />
Sure the arena goofballs still need something to show off how strong they are when they're sitting next to the auction house, the titles and faster netherdrake (if you could mount in azeroth) seem like a decent way to go with this.<br />
Give them cosmetic stuff to show off how skilled they are rather than gameplay items that replace all the other items pre/post-raids.<br />
<br />
The only problem with all of this is no pvp grind means people don't have to subscribe for as long to get their fill of power, they'll be sickened by it eventually and quit for a fresher feeling game, so the chance of arena becoming a level playing field for all outside of very special tournament circumstances is 0%.</div></div><hr />

Healers heal fine in arena gear, druids tank fine in it. That being said only a Warrior/Pally tank really needs pve gear. I am in Hyjal/BT and some of our people heal with S3 gear and some of our druids tank in it. And yeah you just proved something is wrong, S4 stats won't even be close to S2, why should we even do Sunwell if S4 gear just makes it pointless.</div></div><hr />

The point of PvE is to experience the in-game content and to be better equipped for other pve instances. Plus there's some things in PvE gear that you cant get in arena gear. nubsauce</div></div><hr />

QFT. Really.<br />
<br />
I get pissed off with guildies that think that a SoD spam is the way that a lock should work in instances (breaking CC yeeeay!). And many other similar behaviors. The problem are not the arenas per se - they require coordination. Problem are the BG equipped and zerg minded players with no concept of playing.</div></div><hr />
