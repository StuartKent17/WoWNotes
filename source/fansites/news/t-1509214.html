^ Haha, this. While I appreciate Blizzard is trying to have fun with the community through Faction Pride and such, I think their method of going about it isn't too appealing. But try to enjoy it for what it is, free entertainment with a potential reward at the end depending on Faction that wins.</div></div><hr />

The developers want to add a real sense of danger to WoW. Like if you watch an official WoW related video for example, in order to join up in discussions about it you need to watch it. But you don't know whether watching it will waste precious time that you'll never get back.</div></div><hr />

It's actually kind of condescending. I mean most of the people who follow WoW stuff on the internet are like 25-40 years old now. Has it occurred to them that maybe we actually like technical stuff? That we want to see technical stuff and not Chris Metzen and Paul Jr. talking hamming it up for the Camera</div></div><hr />

I sat up in my chair when the footage of developing of the actual world was shown (&quot;I like to say that we put the WORLD in World of Warcraft;&quot; this was brilliant!), hoping to see something other than bad close ups of people who are saying and doing absolutely nothing, and then I slumped back in disappointment when it was so short-lived. I admit to my fascination with the tech side of it all, and would prefer seeing some actual work being done, on the designing process, and on the actual fabrication of the bikes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CheeseSandwich</div><div class="date">2014-05-01, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to question the hiring of these bike makers.<br />
<br />
They stuffed up the cutting for parts, with no planning or realistic thought put into using huge chunks of metal that would be heavy. <br />
<br />
They hired someone with no experience in art, design and metal fabrication and manufacturing, other than restorations, who then &quot;had to leave for family reasons&quot; (ie. fired).<br />
<br />
They throw out materials used in metal work, because they have no idea what they are. <br />
<br />
Also, there is no store room with a of stock materials needed for metal work. <br />
<br />
I'll assume some time had passed between the first and 3rd episode, say more than a week. If they haven't been able to add anything to those frames in that time worthy of showing progress, then those guys must take a lot of breaks. <br />
<br />
I found parts of the episode a little ironic too. Like maybe it's a lesson that Blizz is trying to teach us all, that sometimes stuff doesn't go as planned, that things can go awry and slow down a project.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arac</div><div class="date">2014-05-01, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i really like the idea of the choppers and to make them available ingame (yeah, not just one of them plz)... but to give them 5 weeks is a joke. i want them to look damn good and not just timeframed shit. give them 10-15, make those vids less boring and show some love by doing it... and the best part was to see how disappointed the blizzardguys were by not be given the stuff they wanted to see in their timeframe. welcome in our shoes fellas.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PuppetShowJustice</div><div class="date">2014-05-01, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, there literally isn't even anything to talk about after these episodes. What's the point in a weekly release if there isn't anything to see or discuss? I literally had to stop the video to get a look at the tusk design on the front of the Horde bike because otherwise the camera wasn't willing to show it long enough to get a good look at it.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat that. The motorcycle show was completely unwilling to show the motorcycle. <br />
<br />
And we didn't even really SEE the Alliance bike at all except that metal casing they're trying to put on it. Yay? What's the damn point of this?!</div></div><hr />

what sence of danger?!?!?! voting which team will win?!?! bikes? it does not look serious and not even close...what interest?! looking for 7 minutes of bla bla my team will win! no my! jee what a waste. its oposite...i think its a lack of ideas...they does not seem to be realy interested in going forward...last time it was joining activision but i dont see any diferences...<br />

Over weeks now i have thought about the chances of the alliance bike winning even if it looked twice as badass. Doesn't seem likely.<br />

lol wtf as if it's the worst thing in the world or it effects you in some way. <br />
<br />
<br />
I Just wish they were longer, lol. <br />
<br />
People need to stop jumping on hate trains just because it's the trendy thing to do. I see it every day in some form or another. It's disgusting. This shit does not effect when WoD or Beta is released, I can assure you that. It will not cost you a raid tier. It will not do anything except benefit you by A. entertaining you if you happen to watch and like the series and B. get you a special item in-game that they're building in real life as well. It's fucking cool in my opinion. <br />

Make a show about the art assets and design that goes into the game. That would be much more interesting to me than this bike nonsense.<br />
<br />
Actually - that's a kickass idea.<br />
Make episodes of following each of design team as they work with expansion stuff - none of that overscripted &quot;PR-stuff, but their real everyday-work stuff. *That* show I would watch.. this chopper stuff is just a bit... well silly and pathetic.</div></div><hr />

I found parts of the episode a little ironic too. Like maybe it's a lesson that Blizz is trying to teach us all, that sometimes stuff doesn't go as planned, that things can go awry and slow down a project.<br />
<br />
and what you wanted? some 60 years old experienced guy with mechanic computer instead of head?! not easy work you know...</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming you have never worked in a fabrication shop or anything like that because the things you mentioned are quite common. Plus with the bs timeframe they have to build these bikes they don't have usual couple of weeks to plan the build. In the end it's a scripted show with obvious added drama to make it seem more frantic than it is. <br />
<br />
The disappointment after disappointment line was rather ironic I thought. Maybe these guys finally understand how the player base has been feeling since Cata.</div></div><hr />

Everyone knows these are scripted shows, they are made to entertain like WWE, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones etc etc. Its a TV show and all shows follow a script. They don't start the show by saying &quot;Based on a true story&quot;. So I don't get why people keep flaming these episodes for being fake and a waste of time.<br />
<br />
These episodes entertain me for a few minutes and I take it as that. We get it though, it's fake. Change the channel if you don't like it.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard wanting some1 to do stuff in half the time needed... and then are claiming &quot;when its ready&quot; on their own product. Sorta says it all.<br />
<br />
<br />
It makes sense when you realize that it's just satire making fun of the community that supports their game. It's a scripted &quot;reality show&quot; and I'm assuming prerecorded.<br />
<br />
Either way though, it's clear that that entire part from what I've read without actually watching it because I refuse, is nothing more than a scripted replication of the same scenario the player base is facing with Blizzard. It's their subtle way of saying &quot;f you&quot; and feeling like they're being really coy about it.</div></div><hr />

Original AC eps ran an hour weekly.<br />
Now that might be a bit long for a wepisode but 6 minutes?<br />
If they actually showed some production footage id be more inclined to watch these but we saw both bikes for a split second and some random blizzard people introducing themselves and thats it for this week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But damn there's so much overreacting going on the series; <br />
<br />
- Paul Jr.: ''I know you guys expected to see the bike today, uhmm...'' :confused::(<br />
- Blizzard guy: ''SO we expected to see the bike... and that didn't happen'' :(<br />
- Blizzard guy 2: ''This is disappointment after disappointment'' :(:(:(<br />
- Blizzard guy 3: ''Paul apparently had some stuff to show us... and then... HE DIDN'T...'' :(<br />
- Paul Jr.: ''I don't want to waste their time, so I HAVE to figure out something.'' :(<br />
<br />
The Drama-meter is over 9000!!!<br />
<br />
... I love it :D<br />
<br />
So next episode Paul Jr. shows them something. He gets up drops his drawers and moons them! And says, &quot;This is from your playerbase who are tired of waiting for you to produce an expac on time.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you all imagine how the director of this series is putting it all together?<br />
<br />
Scene: Paul Jr on one side, computer screen in front of him, with the Devs on the other side, also looking at a computer screen. The Director puts up the cue card &quot;On my signal, Devs fracture their skulls by slamming their foreheads with their wrists, lean way back and yell DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER DISAPPOINTMENT!&quot;<br />
<br />
I have to laugh at all of this, because Blizzard seems to be trying to make this into something which is supposed to be serious. Honestly, I think that Paul Sr would be great to lead the Alliance Team, with Abby Lee Miller (Dance Moms) as the natural choice to lead the Horde Team.<br />

What progress? 3rd week in and we've seen a fork and a gas tank cover.<br />

I really had my hopes up when they announced this because I love motorcycles and even though I don't play wow anymore wow themed motorcycles sounds interesting. <br />
<br />
They should have just hired a camera crew to film the building of the bikes, and done interviews.<br />

This is scripted reality show at its finest. I've followed the whole American Choppers show almost from its inception, and it was very entertaining, I like bikes, that helps. But this is scripted as hell. The bikes are probably already done and this is just to add to the excitement and anticipation.<br />
<br />
I don't get why they are doing this though. Publicity is an obvious reason, but I don't think Wow is gonna attract a lot of new players at this stage of the game, and given the competition.<br />
As much as I like Wow, it looks outdated as hell, especially when you compare it to other games and games set for release this year. A bike and some coverage on a chopper show won't change that.</div></div><hr />

Yea, this thing also screams scripted, The Alliance team &quot;threw out&quot; the welding reagent because there 'wasn't enough to warrant keeping it'. And the Horde, also has trouble, because a WHOLE FUCKIN' TEAM MEMBER LEFT...<br />

In one of the shots of the outside of Jr's building you see a ton of snow, NY hasn't had that much snow in almost two months now. I'd bet my house the bikes are all done and sitting in storage waiting for the big reveal.<br />
<br />
Anyone that has seen an episode of American Choppers knows how this was going to go. Someone big comes in wanting something, there's a restraint to build a little tension, then something goes wrong to build more tension, then something good happens to break the tension, then the big reveal. I'd have to agree that Jr probably got whatever amount of time needed to build both bikes the way Blizzard wanted them (I mean come on, none of those guys have probably played a minute of WoW and yet they &quot;know&quot; how each side looks and feels) and the rest is just scripted out to provide filler. <br />
<br />
And those that are Blizzard fans know how this is going to end, one side wins but there will be a big surprise in that both sides get their respective bikes and the real ones will probably be auctioned off for charity.</div></div><hr />

See that's what we were expecting. Like at the very least 22 minute episodes. Considering there's a shit load of work that goes into building a motorcycle, you can't tell me they couldn't have paid some kid to stand there with a camera and get several hours of footage of them building the bikes for them to sift through. <br />
<br />
I used to watch American Chopper, and there was a lot more technical stuff. It wasn't 100% drama, maybe 40-60%. Azeroth Choppers is about 80% drama, 7.5% &quot;previously on Azeroth Choppers&quot; 7.5% &quot;Next time on Azeroth Choppers&quot; and about 5% actual bike building. With 7-9 minute episodes to boot.</div></div><hr />

The bikes are already done.... and they just limited to 5 weeks just to sound like they are under pressure (he would not accept such a stupid contract without high end emergency pay which would lead him to hire twice if not three times as much staff to finish the bikes off). Take a look at an respective Australian TV Real life action show which had 1/3 of the viewers glued to their tv called &quot;my Kitchen rules&quot; everything was done before hand they had to break it up and give them interviews to make the show &quot;more exciting&quot;.<br />

<br />
But it's like a train wreck in progress. ... can't stop watching.<br />
<br />
<br />
HAHA your comment is such a trainwreck that I can't stop laughing at you.<br />
<br />
All these reality shows are &quot;put on&quot;, don't you watch other reality tv shows like Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, My kitchen rules, My house rules etc.<br />
<br />
Next your gonna tell me that wrestling is all real and not an act, if you believe this show is a trainwreck you might as well believe WWE and WWF for christ sake.<br />
<br />
Now let me train you why your comment is a trainwreck....<br />
<br />
<br />
1. EVERYONE IS CLEAN WHEN THEY ARE TALKING TO THE CAMERA -- there is no grease on them, no cuts, no safety glasses and no gloves seriously if they were in any danger or actually working on the bikes the clothes would be dirty.<br />
<br />
2. The bikes are already made 5-10 weeks ahead of time they are just giving snapshots of progress (this is shown in the very first episode when the frame was already done).<br />
<br />
3. If would be a massive safety issue and blizzard could be liable if they push in getting the bikes in under that timeline.<br />
<br />
4. Other shows are following this same process, when the person is talking directly into the camera the clothes are clean, make-up is put on and not even a strand of their hair has moved from the makers perfect set of hair (meaning they are either already done or other people have worked on it).<br />
<br />
5. Everyone is reading off of bloody cue cards (look at their eyes they are not looking in the camera but just off).<br />
<br />
6. Take all this in account and you'll never be fooled by these shows again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 minutes of recap<br />
2 minutes of introduction to Blizzard team members<br />
1.5 minutes of reality TV draaaaamaaaaa<br />
about 30 seconds of actual bike building<br />
1 minute of NEXT TIME ON AZEROTH CHOPPERS<br />
<br />
I wish they'd make them twice as long with less filler and show more of the bikes and how they're built.</div></div><hr />

Notice the empty crest socket. Maybe in the next shows they will tell us that the tank tracks have to go because it's too hard to steer with them...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quite possibly, in loads of the OCC's intro's they usually show a half finished bike right before the show even starts for some reason. Probably to get people excited to watch or something. <br />
<br />
And it looks like the Alliance's tank tracks are gone yeah. Odd. Maybe it's just a temporary thing to get a better view on the model at that moment they're working on it or so.</div></div><hr />

Mel Stultz barely works on bikes or cars. He doesn't ride and doesn't even have a license to ride. For his projects he hires out people to do all of the work namely brothers Jamie and Joe Jastrebski. A client of his actually is suing him because instead Of working on the guys Merc he switched the car out with one from Mexico and scratched the vin. (Jasper vs. Stultz Nj)<br />
As for the family problems, he was just arrested for domestic abuse. As the founder of the Race of Gentlemen it would be in his best interest to change the name. He's just a good talker with no credibility and a criminal sensibility.<br />

<br />
&quot;X has some personal problems and can't work on the bike.&quot; Oh, REALLY?! ........... dumbass show<br />
<br />
They showed absolutely nothing in this episode...<br />
Problem is Mel doesn't like working. His feet hurt standing so much.</div></div><hr />

Personally I would have preferred a Mad Men crossover. Get Don Draper in with a knockout pitch that will make me want to buy WoD.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thuran</div><div class="date">2014-05-03, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too short and too obviously fake. A lot of time is wasted on summing up what happened last week, even if they are shown ON THE SAME PAGE. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I have watched american choppers and it was fairly entertaining, however they got a bike done in a single episode, with just some drama in between commercials, not every 5 minutes, as will be the case with this. <br />
<br />
Also, even if its purely to create &quot;suspense&quot;, the entire 5-week deadline just seemed stupid and their disappointment was even worse! At least try to pretend that it isnt completely scripted. The reason something like american choppers can be enjoyed is that it allows for suspension of disbelief, which isn't really the case here. <br />
<br />
Also, they could at least have shown what concepts they were working from, instead of pretending like they were making it up as they go, and i find it hard to believe that professionals would mess up something like the weight of the horns, especially as they could impact the maneuverability of the bike, depending on how the weight is distributed. <br />
<br />
Maybe as 3 longer episodes, it would have worked better and feel more like something was accomplished.</div></div><hr />

These &quot;episodes&quot; feel like trailers. Also, leave out the fake drama, it isn't what these kind of series needs.. it's not a soap opera.</div></div><hr />
