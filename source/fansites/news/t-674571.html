Patch 3.3 - Build 10596 Titles 
A lot of people were disappointed by the lack of new titles in Patch 3.3, especially with the 10-Man and 25-Man version of the achievement to kill Arthas sharing the same title reward on PTRs. Good news, this is most likely a bug.

Patch 3.3 - Build 10596 Titles<br />
A lot of people were disappointed by the lack of new titles in Patch 3.3, especially with the 10-Man and 25-Man version of the achievement to kill Arthas sharing the same title reward on PTRs. Good news, this is most likely a bug. <br />
<br />
In the latest PTR Build, 4 titles were added to the game: <br />
<br />
%s the Light of Dawn - Reward of Realm First! Light of Dawn! (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4576/realm-first-light-of-dawn/)<br />
%s the Frost Ender - Reward of The Frost Ender (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4583/the-frost-ender/) (10-Man)<br />
%s the Kingslayer - Reward of The Kingslayer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4584/the-kingslayer/) (25-Man)<br />
%s of the Ashen Verdict - Unknown yet, but most likely rewarded when you hit Exalted with The Ashen Verdict (http://db.mmo-champion.com/f/1156/the-ashen-verdict/)<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 8 Weapon Models Preview<br />
I spent so much time discussing Icecrown in the past 2 weeks that I almost forgot to mention PvP content. Just like any major patch, this one will introduce a new arena season and of course new weapon models (hurray, shields!). Armor sets arent available yet and we'll have to wait a later PTR build to get a look at them.<br />

A Mask For All Occasions<br />
Since getting all of the masks is just another achievement and not something required for the meta-achievement, we are okay with this remaining as-is. Yes, it may take a couple years of doing the Hallow's End events to get it done but that just puts it along side things like Bloody Rare and Frostbitten. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/20566567932-a-mask-for-all-occasions.html))<br />
<br />
Race Changes ETA<br />
We're still working on it. We want to make sure the conversions are as smooth as possible and the infrastructure will support such changes, as is the case with the faction change service. Contrary to the original poster's claims, the conversion tables for changing races within one's own faction are completely different from the faction change service. This requires separate development time. We're also busy ensuring our Battle.net account service is fully fleshed out to support the entirety of the World of Warcraft population as well as these paid services.<br />
<br />
The only thing better than offering a service people want is making sure that service works when people want it. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20566358700-blizzard-is-lying.html))</div></div><hr />

I don't see your point, why would there be? It's Ashtongue Deathsworn faction all over again (shadow res pieces for BT)<br />
<br />
There are BS, LW and Tailor formulas, think it was already mentioned that they are nature res pieces for some gimmick fights (for the crazy prof and the abos, most likely, or maybe for the vampires)</div></div><hr />

It'll probably be frost resistance.<br />
But still, it'd not hurt to have an extra flavor alchemy / engineering pattern in the mix.<br />

Funny that you would mention that. Not more than 4 hours ago, I got the pet from the treat bag, and turned around and got the Hallowed Helm on an alt. Between the two characters I picked up a grand total of 4 masks (including the masks I got last year).</div></div><hr />

Wonder if it's gonna be hardmode kill or just regular. <br />

I get the feeling hardmode is gonna be one hell of a hard fight. Don't know why. Hopefully it's just a regular clear reward. Not a title I wanna miss because of pre-expansion laziness that sets in.<br />

<br />
Read the tooltip again, it says &quot;10M heroic&quot; and &quot;25M heroic&quot; to get the titles. Sounds pretty clear to me :). It means that you'll probably have to work VERY hard for those candies. Hell, most guilds doesn't have Starcaller yet (me neither xD) and it's already like 1 patch away... These titles will be really rewarding to get. Damm, Arthas 25M HM should be the hardest thing ever experienced in Wow so far xD<br />

It all looks really good though. Hopefully they've not used all the good models already and there'll be better to come in ICC. Especially the staves. Shoveltusk horn + stick =/= stave. Makes me wish I had the option to hide it :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fifth element, which is Aether from the Greek culture, or Akasha from the Hinduism and Buddhism. <br />
<br />
And for the Japanese culute i think the fifth element is Void (correct me if im wrong), which we have everywhere in Azeroth, the lock pet for example.<br />
<br />
But i think the Fith element has to do with ragnaros already, you have the quest item 'Aqual Quintessence' and the achievement &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; for getting exalted with Hydraxian Waterlords.<br />
<br />

<br />
The elements theme in the game is based around the eternal essences: Earth, Air, Water, Fire, Shadow, Life.<br />
<br />
The VOA correlation is toward the elementals outside of the fortress. There are Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, and Shadow elementals. There's also those plants on the west side, and I'm not sure if that would leave room for a Freya-like life/living type of guardian. That's not to say they'll end up doing any of this in the future, but if it ends up being a teleporter to another wing of three rooms it would leave them placeholders for another 2 seasons / 2 content patches.</div></div><hr />

dude... it's nature resist pieces.<br />
they are patterns used for gear / gimmick fights.<br />
what do you want for alchemy and engineering ?<br />
nature resist pot to absorb 2 milion damage ?<br />

<br />
<br />
IMO keep the 20 mask achieve as is but stick in two achieves for 5 and 10, that way players build towards the 20 mask goal gradually rather than 1 mast then 30+ masks later (you can and will get duplicates) you can get all 20.<br />
<br />
I'd actually like to know if anyone has gotten that achieve yet. Bloody rare and frostbitten have been gotten, not really a QQ but would be funny to see if it's the least attained achieve in game.</div></div><hr />

I know going from alliance to horde you started the tourny over... but don't know race why i don't see why you would have to start it over and achievements are race based so it won't matter via that side you'll still have the same achievements.</div></div><hr />

BUT, if i find some, I hit with my tooth picks very hard. but often with no result but laughing. Be informed, i'm not whining. but this gap is a little to wide. (Gap between what you can get without arena, in fact, erm... nothing, and those highly skilled *g arena players. /golfclap).
