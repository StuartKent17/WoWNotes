Our global pre-launch test of WoW Classic will begin on Thursday, August 8 at 11:00 a.m. PDT and is scheduled to end on Friday, August 9. This test will be available to all World of Warcraft players with a current subscription or active game time in all regions. The maximum character level will be 15.<br />
<br />
We ask that players please log-in and play as much as possible during the first two hours of the test – 11:00 a.m. PDT to 1:00 p.m. PDT, as that is when we’ll be actively monitoring for issues important to launch.<br />
<br />
WoW Classic is now ready for all players to install from the Blizzard Battle.net Desktop App in advance of the test. To install WoW Classic:<br />
<br />
<br />
Open the Blizzard Battle.net Desktop App and select World of Warcraft in the game selection menu on the left.<br />
Under the Version dropdown menu, select World of Warcraft Classic. If you have more than one World of Warcraft account, you’ll see a second dropdown for Account. In that column, select the active account to associate with your WoW Classic install.<br />
Click the Install button. You’ll see an installation progress bar that will show you when the installation is complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
Minimum Specs<br />
We’ve finalized the minimum specifications required to play WoW Classic on PC or Mac. Please note that these are much lower than the minimum specs required to play Battle for Azeroth. Recommended specs are the same for both.<br />
<br />
In our hardware testing, we found that we were able to successfully run WoW Classic on systems manufactured and released in the 2007-2009 timeframe, and thanks to improvements in how we build and distribute game data, the hard drive space requirements are actually smaller than they were in version 1.12 of original WoW.<br />

while they're running mythic+++++ of some generic dungeon for the 1000th time, i'll be attempting to clear a boss in Uldaman in crafted greens and vendor bought weapons at level 38, dying multiple times, and having the most fun i've had in years with a blizzard product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
current dungeons are AOE garbage. everyone has an interrupt, a self heal, overgear everything. yes mythic 7+ gets hard, but its just piling on affixes and damage and an endurance competition. <br />
<br />
you're probably right in that we're much better players now (certainly I am). gives us a great opportunity to teach new players. the mechanics in classic are very different, it will take time to adjust for many.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't want to crush your dreams, but you're in for a surprise. Most of your &quot;skills&quot; rely on the game drawing AOE circles around your feet or screaming at you in bold letters telling you exactly what to do. Things like threat and mana are actually important. Trash respawns. The dungeons aren't totally linear with helpful maps and arrows telling you where to go. It's a different game, friendo.</div></div><hr />

Or, you could read what Blizzard said to know what they want to test.. Since they did say it. <br />
<br />
Their request for users makes it sound like a stress test, but holding it in the early afternoon when almost everyone is at work or school makes it seem they don't want to stress it. Maybe it's for EU gamers. /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and no. By the time most players do hit Uldaman they should know better with how to handle threat as well as pulls but it's going to be a death trap for both Deadmines and Ragefire Chasm where unsuspecting players are going to learn fast and hard how it's different from retail.<br />

Goes till Friday my dude. It's not like they're going to shut the NA servers off at 3pm and call it a day. This is also a global test so it's going to be the right time somewhere in the world at any given time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said they are actively monitoring it for the first 2 hours my guy, specifically requesting players log in and play as much as possible during that time so they can test for launch issues. It's not like it's not highlighted in white text at the top of the post.<br />
<br />
&quot;We ask that players please log-in and play as much as possible during the first two hours of the test – 11:00 a.m. PDT to 1:00 p.m. PDT, as that is when we’ll be actively monitoring for issues important to launch.&quot;<br />
<br />
But as you say it's a global test, it makes more sense that they are picking that time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes and no. By the time most players do hit Uldaman they should know better with how to handle threat as well as pulls but it's going to be a death trap for both Deadmines and Ragefire Chasm where unsuspecting players are going to learn fast and hard how it's different from retail.<br />
Not that I'm trying to pick a fight with you, but just to note, I healed leveling dungeons up to Sunken Temple on my nearly-all-agi-gear Enhancement Shaman during BC. It was rare that we had a tank or a healer because you still had to do the majority of your leveling questing, and questing as heal or tank spec was painful, and respec'ing was painful &amp; expensive, so most leveling dungeons were done with 5 DPS. I didn't do any Vanilla dungeons past Sunken Temple, because I could never find groups for them. Just saying that I&quot;m guessing I would have been up for healing those as well if I could have found four more players.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be trying out Classic, and I have friends that are going to resub, just to play Classic, so I'm not hating on it. I'm hoping it is enjoyable and can sustain interest. I just think leveling dungeons are going to be very easy compared to how sophisticated the community is. Back then I was healing in the wrong spec, with nearly no Int gear, with no addons, and clicking. Click player, then click heal spell. Click next player that's getting low and click spell. Rinse and repeat. (and everyone lived)<br />
<br />
It was always nice getting a Priest or Druid in group, because everyone just expected the priest to heal, regardless of the fact, that they were all shadow spec, and DPS Druids could still tank well in Bear form, especially in Feral. Feral Druid in group would make for very smooth/easy runs. Or the one time I actually found a Prot Warrior in our 30's and we were 2-manning SM at level range, with me tossing off-heals periodically. Speaking of which, Enh Shammy &amp; Warrior is probably a good questing duo.</div></div><hr />
