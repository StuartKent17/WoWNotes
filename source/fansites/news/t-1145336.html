The Lorewalker Stories<br />
In Mists of Pandaria there are several extra lore related achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/character/exploration/pandaria) to go with the regular zone exploration achievements. <br />
<br />
For example, to complete Fish Tails (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6846) you must find small statues or other objects hidden around Pandaria and read the lore. Once you have found all of the objects for an achievement, Lorewalker Cho will send you mail that asks you to meet him at the Seat of Knowledge. Once there he will narrate a small story that gives you some more information about Pandaria lore. <br />
<br />
In the video below, the Fish Tails (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6846) and Ballad of Liu Lang (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6856) stories are told to you.<br />

Blizzard Entertainment has always taken cheating in any form in Blizzard games very seriously, and that's no different for Diablo® III. If a Diablo III player is found to be cheating or using hacks, bots, or modifications in any form, then as outlined in the Diablo III end user license agreement (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/d3_eula.html), that player can be permanently banned from the game. This means that the player will be permanently unable to log in to Battle.net® to play Diablo III with his or her account.<br />
<br />
Playing Diablo III legitimately means playing with an unaltered game client. Doing otherwise violates our policies for Battle.net and Diablo III (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/diablo-iii-exploitation-policy), and it goes against the spirit of fair play that all of our games are based on. We strongly recommend that you avoid using any hacks, cheats, bots, or exploits. Suspensions and bans of players that have used or start using cheats and hacks will begin in the near future.<br />
<br />
Warden has been. Monitoring what's being tracked by the system is an important part of the process before banning in waves. We need to be sure the detections are accurate. It's a reminder of the rules and a promise that ban waves will commence shortly. Nothing more. <br />

General<br />
<br />
If the authentication service is busy, the login checkbox will now wait at &quot;Authenticating Credentials&quot; until a player's login attempt can be processed. As a result, players should no longer encounter Error 37 when logging in.<br />
Achievements have been granted to players who previously completed their objectives, but were not correctly awarded completion credit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Fixed several crashes which occurred when clicking on player-generated item links in the game client<br />

<br />
What new mechanics?<br />
<br />
Add spawns?<br />
Frontal cleave strike like trash in Stonecore?<br />
Bomb drops like the boss in Zul'Aman?<br />
Portion of room being covered in flames like Felmyst in Sunwell or Valiona in BoT?<br />
Patch of green goo left on the ground that require repositioning of boss like 2nd boss in Blood Furnace and about 100 after?<br />
Untankable boss that follows someone like 2nd boss in BT or one of the bosses in Ahn'Qiraj?<br />
Jumping on a boss to attack something on him like 1st boss in Ulduar?<br />
<br />
Did I miss something?<br />
<br />
And yeah, sliding down the rope looks awesome. Character performing the old &quot;listening to the hands&quot; animation while sliding down a rope as thick as industrial drain pipe. While being a yard away from it. <br />
<br />
In before someone tells me it's beta. Just imagine me laughing back at you if you want to tell me that, it'll save me coming back.</div></div><hr />

Every gaming company claims to be against cheating, though most of it is merely empty promises and misleading PR. If Blizzard were truly against cheating, they'd devote an entire team to rooting it out instead of only banning enough to fulfill a quota.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unholyground</div><div class="date">2012-06-12, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly blizz should just implement their own purchasable bot that you pay for monthly for like 5$ and it would make life easier for them and cut down on illegal botting and people who have a few 80's wont have to do that gay ass grind to level 85/90 anymore, they could just put an hourly limit on your botting or make the bots not pickup non quest based loot to prevent AH inflation. Or even let people buy level 85 premades once you have an 85?</div></div><hr />

<br />
gotta love that...<br />
<br />
we're not fixing the problem we're just hiding it by not letting you see the error message while you stare at a screen for an undetermined amount of time waiting for the error...err...authentication to be completed. <br />
<br />
So now, when you go on the forums to complain about this instead of being able to state the exact problem &quot;error 37 msg&quot; you will have to somehow prove that was the issue because all the fanboys will jump in the thread and tell you its your computer or isp and not blizzard's servers and to put on your tinfoil hat etc because they get in first try every time<br />
<br />
hats off to you blizz that's brilliant, cheap, lazy and a slap in the face to loyal customers but brilliant nonetheless</div></div><hr />

In before someone tells me it's beta. Just imagine me laughing back at you if you want to tell me that, it'll save me coming back.<br />
<br />
actually the bombs placed around the room.. are different than zul'amun.. i dont understand why you are so butt hurt.<br />
<br />
if you actually played the game, the zul'amun bombs detonate after a short duration once they are summoned.<br />
the bombs on this fight have to be set off by a player or by other bombs (except during the 2 phases he launches out 5 bombs), also these bombs send out 4 lines of fire in straight lines, unlike the zul'amun bombs which just explode in a radious.<br />
<br />
so please.. tell me the similarity? oh.. because they both have bombs?? please.. just stop playing games if your going to hate on something because it is similar to something else...</div></div><hr />

micro differences from previous implementetions are not enough to declare something entirely new. That's like a different shaped car would be declared a new revolutionary change to the industry.<br />
<br />
When we speak about new mechanics, we mean new mechanics in all its sense. For example:<br />
<br />
Double Jump or dashes by double tapping directions or space.<br />
High Low attack combination like in Tekken or other fighting games.<br />
Or perhaps a bar which shows you the sequence of skills you imputed and executes them in order.</div></div><hr />

LMFAO, if you really wanted ur games to be fair play you'd freaking balance the classes properly . Oh and talking about fair play when you have bugs that remain unfixed throughout a whole freaking raid tier (LOLMADNESS?) even tho we keep paying every month.... the irony. blizz can eat shit for that, dont come and give us crap about fair play.<br />

I can't honestly remember the last time Blizzard did a mass ban wave in Wow and if they ever did one in the next 2-5 year's I'd be shocked and amazed. But oh goodness no D3 is more important we will use the banhammer now. As one guy put it in this thread &quot;incoming deletion of the entire diablo player base&quot; is probably very accurate unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

Doing otherwise violates our policies for Battle.net and Diablo III, and it goes against the spirit of fair play that all of our games are based on.<br />

I don't think that's what they meant by fair play.<br />
<br />
They're implying that they want players to play fair. They want us to be fair , but they're just not towards us. I was just pointing out the hypocrisy that blizzard has been showing. It doesn't matter if it's by playing or balancing classes or fixing bugs , being fair in general is what i was talking about.</div></div><hr />

It is. I do think Blizzard is in for a lot of trouble though with the Real world AH.<br />
<br />
First guy banned that has over $5000 bucks on the AH is going to sue them and there's a good chance Blizzard will have to return his outstanding money after their cut, otherwise that will constitute conversion and theft. I mean people have sued and won for non valued property in games. I shudder to think what can of trouble they are opening with this feature.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if that's ever gonna be an issue because to hold currency it uses PayPal or your Blizzard Balance which can be used to purchase WoW time or mounts. It's not stored in-game. Meaning yes, the person that cheated to make $5k would be unable to make any more money using D3 without buying a new license but is free to do whatever he wants with the money he made. Technically he could buy another D3 license. Hmmmmmmmm that makes me think that cheaters just need to make enough money in the time before they get caught to be over $60 and it is worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

Just pointing out, but the FAQ (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battle-net-balance-frequently-asked-questions-faq) states &quot;at this time, Battle.net Balance may not be used for Blizzard Store purchases such as digital pets, mounts, or apparel and collectibles.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was hoping to use the balance to supplement buying pets/mounts until I read the FAQ. :(</div></div><hr />
