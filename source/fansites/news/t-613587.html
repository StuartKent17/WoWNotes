&quot;Server First&quot; Feats of Strength titles removed<br />
We've decided to remove the titles for the Realm First Feats of Strength that are associated with reaching level 80. We've also removed the titles associated with the Realm First Feats of Strength associated with gaining 450 skill in the professions and secondary skill. Lastly, we've removed the title associated with Realm First to accomplish the Northrend Vanguard achievement.<br />
<br />
Realm First boss kill achievements will still grant a title. <br />
<br />
As a side note, Beta characters will retain their titles or end up displaying a broken title. This won't carry over to the live realms but it is merely a symptom of removing these titles from the game. If we were to do another wipe of the achievement system, the Beta titles would go away. <br />
<br />
Will 3.0 bring the 60-70 XP Changes?<br />
The 3.0.2 Content Patch deployed on live servers a few weeks before the release of WotLK will include the change mades to make leveling faster. <br />
Will 3.0 bring the 60-70 XP Changes?<br />
Confirmed.</div></div><hr />

They made it easier to get from 1-60 by easing the xp required per level, however they also added that xp onto 60-70. Now that tons of people are at 70, are we going to see those thrown in right away. Thus making it longer than it should be to for those already at 70.</div></div><hr />

bah, didnt some china kid jump from the window because he thought he will be able to shift to crow form? :P<br />
<br />
anyway, i was soo looking forward to this titles, personally wanted to get shammy one, maybe even tauren, prolly not overall number one tho :( but well, the shaman title wasnt that exciting anyway, &quot;xx of the ten storms&quot; doesnt sound cool enough for me imo :D if anything, they could just come with Far Seer (maybe hint for another hero class? hopefully NOT) or with smth else cool .)</div></div><hr />

Unlikely, because if the rewards would have stayed i would bet my left nut that on the vast majority of servers people would get to 80 within 72 hours due to guildboosting etc, if not faster.<br />
You dont die from pulling true 3 days of constant play ;)<br />
<br />
But yes, titles should be awarded as a reward from doing something special/hard, not for rushing to get the first x.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we'll see the titles again, just gained in another form.<br />
(Classquests, proffesion quests for the gathering proffs+FA, Titles based on % of rare recipe's obtained etc.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akutare</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say I mostly objected from the angle of it going against their claim of wanting people not to fly through the content. It actually would have greatly exceeded the rush that Death Knights would have caused if they required you first to get to 80. Sleep deprivation, sharing accounts, all stuff that isn't good to encourage. I could also see how it's sort of a shame to throw away titles that are so significant to people who follow the lore for a one shot race. It'd actually be fairly cool to see some epic quest chain that gets you the title for your class. Sometime daunting enough to discourage people from going for it or give up part of the way through. Not sure if it will ever happen though.<br />
<br />
Ah but I am relieved, now I have no reason to spend the first night trying for the fishing title out of compulsion. <br />
<br />
Also means no selling crafting materials for 500g a piece.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaypartheid</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In other news, however, perhaps the removal of these titles allows Blizzard the time to take a step back and reevaluate exactly how said titles and Feats of Strength should be implemented.<br />
<br />
Being the first dope to 80 or 450 is way too easy and way too impractical to really implement. Sure, the first nerdo who gets to 80 gets to strut his title, but did he really have to work for it? Guild tagging takes away the work in leveling; hell, the first guy who got to 70 in TBC did it in about a day or so, if I recall. ( IT'S A DUMB IDEA, IF YOU DIDN'T CATCH MY DRIFT. )<br />
<br />
Anywho, I figure that Blizzard would satiate the socially-inept and the folks who really want their titles by implementing an epic questline of sorts; you know, something that takes a lot of time, effort, and machismo to grind out and finish. You know, something a little more involving than rocketing to 80?<br />
<br />
~That's just how I see it though~</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vallos</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it'd be pretty accurate lore-wise and pretty difficult game-wise if they implemented the titles only to players who complete 95% of all quests (or something to that effect). It'd reward casuals who want to just do quests, and it would give frothing fanboys something to do besides raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the titles were a cool idea...but I also agree with the people saying it would be kinda lame for only 1 person to get it. But at the same time I wouldn't want it to be something that everyone got. It would need to feel epic, like you participated in something...so maybe the server first 25 or something like that. I dunno...I hope we see these titles again at some point for something.</div></div><hr />

I think that's why they dropped it. It's anti lich king. They want us to take our time and enjoy the content. Those titles would reward us for doing the opposite.</div></div><hr />

this was a bad idea in the 1st place, but im glad they removed them.<br />
things like these r not healthy, even for casual players.</div></div><hr />

1- Against all they said (even on loading screen...) about not playing too much WoW and enjoy content instead of rushing.<br />
2- The easy way it was to get some of those titles right out of the bat after 1 or 2 days.<br />
3- Beta players would have a hell of a advantage over others (like the 1st 70 who knew exactly what to do and where to go on live to get it fast).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maxed Skill and/or %of respies would be a good idea for Trade skills. This i think would promote some people in investing some extra time in to their trade skills. Also it would scale with future when they raise the trade skill Cap or add more respies it would be an added incentive for those people to seek them out and to level their trade skills. It would also be a nice reward for those that do finely max out a particularly difficult trade skill like enchanting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Just having 450 enchanting skill should be reward in itself, for having completed the biggest gold sink in the entire game. <br />
As for % of recipes, all this would encourage is people to go back to the AQ instances to pick up rare recipies. Unfortunately, AQ20 is still a 4 day reset and AQ40 is a 1 week reset, so it isn't a fast process to pick up stuff like enchant gloves: frost power, etc.</div></div><hr />
