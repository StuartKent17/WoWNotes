Legendary Item Bad Luck Protection<br />
Yes, bad luck protection does exist.<br />
<br />
When it comes to most targettable loot from a boss (gear/mounts/pets etc.) those drops have a fixed drop chance. If &quot;Boots of Unending Awesomeness&quot; have a 33% chance of dropping, that chance will always be 33% regardless of how many loot-eligible times you kill that boss.<br />
<br />
Legendaries on the other hand, if you are running Legendary-eligible content and don't get a Legendary, then your chance of getting one with increase over time. The more content you do without getting a Legendary, the higher your chance will become.<br />
<br />
Let's say you have 3-sided die. If you roll the number 3, you get the item.<br />
<br />
In the case of the &quot;Boots of Unending Awesomeness,&quot; you could roll the die 20 times and never get a 3. Your chance of getting a 3 on your next roll is still 33%, as all rolls are considered unique and do not take previous rolls into account; the die cares not for the fact that you've yet to roll a 3.*<br />
<br />
(*note that this refers to the items that drop directly from the boss and not the system of winning items via bonus loot, which has its own logic.)<br />
<br />
In the case of Legendaries, you could roll the die 20 times and never get a 3. However, with bad-luck protection, the die will become more and more weighted toward giving you a 3. Due to the die becoming more weighted, the chance of getting a 3 on your next roll will be higher than without bad luck protection.

<br />
Only, it doesn't really. You still need to complete balance of power quest line, which requires Nighthold before you can use it. You need to unlock the base version of each tier of artifact skins before you can use the other 3 colours of it. So even if you complete a +15mythic, kill 8 world bosses and/or complete glory of the legion hero you still cannot use that skin until you complete all the raid quests, which cannot be done in raid finder.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard can create every creature you can imagine, but to animate it in all details takes lots of manpower and time. The 3d model iteself isn't the main problem and a sketch like this is done in just 1-2 hours.</div></div><hr />

Any chance of an alliance variant maybe? I realize it wouldnt make much sense, but still seriously cool design there. Maybe it can have elvish looking armor like the fox mount only more Night-elven, since the barrens is close to Ashenvale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bought it day 1 for $17.99 + 8% sales tax = 19.43<br />
Sold it for $23.75 w/o digital copy or bonus items. -20% cut to ebay = $19.00<br />
So I bought the digital copy and bonus items for $0.43.<br />
<br />
Not bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Side note that Giraffe mount is awesome. Iconically warcraft GJ to the artist.</div></div><hr />

Just the same you can't prove it doesn't exist.<br />

Currently every single one of my 110s except the latest one has at least one Legendary; many of my alts got them within the past three weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there was a blue post before that mentioned that designing new mounts is a (relatively) rather easy and fast thing to do on paper, they have dozens of solid and new mount ideas. The problem is that the modeling and animation of new mounts takes a group of developers several months. It's time they can't always afford.<br />
.<br />
On the other hand, re-skinning an existing model might only take one person a day; which is why it's so much more common to see reskinned mounts. Alternatively they seem to like to make a model that's very similar to an older one so they can borrow it's animations also severely reducing the development time.<br />

Countless people doing 300+++ M+ without getting anything isn't enough proof for you? :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)<br />

*Edit: This guy for example : http://www.wowprogress.com/character/eu/ravencrest/Cerli<br />
<br />
Amount of Mythic 2+ Dungeons completed in time: 1307<br />
Amount of Mythic 5+ Dungeons completed in time: 932<br />
Amount of Mythic 10+ Dungeons completed in time: 28<br />
<br />
And remember, this doesn't count the +10-&gt; he has done, but not in time (or lower ones, but I doubt there are many).<br />
<br />
He has &quot;only&quot; 4 legendaries.<br />
<br />
Nice &quot;Bad Luck Protection&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the time it actually gets here it'll end up costing somewhere between +50-150% as much as the actual cost of what you purchased.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Didn't they just say it'd close down temporary back then?).<br />
<br />
blizz dnt give a shit about theRe EU customers, never have and they never will, i mean they forced russians on us in PVP, il never buy any crap of blizzard store which is more than likely made by low payed chinese workers, everything on there store just sucks only people who get excited over this shit are people like panser from wowhead but then again she gets excited over the most trivial crap</div></div><hr />

Lol, the silly thing is a really long time ago I did ask if the donkey models around old Lights Hope Chapel and stuff were ever gonna be used for mounts since they seemed so easy to implement xD I like their long ears</div></div><hr />

People who've done 500+++ M+ and still have 2-3 legendaries however, that is extremely common.<br />
<br />
Legendaries, like the rest of Legion, is completely RNG.<br />
<br />
Bro, it's called RNG for a reason. You can't claim bad luck protection doesn't exist when I've seen two blue posts in the last week saying it does. Okay so some people have done 500+ dungeons and not seen one drop. They're just unlucky. The protection very likely ramps up slowly. <br />
<br />
FYI I still only have 1 legendary let alone 2 or 3</div></div><hr />

And you still trust these &quot;blue gods?&quot;<br />
Because they've never lied to us before, right?<br />
<br />
If I wanted to keep people paying me money, I'd find up something stupid like &quot;Bad Luck Protection&quot; as well.<br />
All the stupids would obviously believe it.<br />
Which again, is why I laugh every time I hear those stupid words.</div></div><hr />
