Need roll makes items soulbound in Patch 4.2<br />
It's in 4.2 (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/177940/need-roll-soulbound) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2592850740?page=2#24))<br />
<br />
Anti Ninja Loot System<br />
I think what you want is a system that keeps people from rolling on the gear you want because you don't believe they deserve it to the same degree you do. There are already restrictions in place that keep people from rolling on items they can't use. We don't want to begin restricting what people can roll on based on current spec, because that's not a black or white situation, which is how the system would need to be set up to work how you'd like.<br />
<br />
There are some surefire ways to avoid or seriously cut down on situations like this, but it should be understood that if you enter into Dungeon Finder your rolls can go up against the rolls of someone else, regardless if you think you should get preference or not.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a certain item, I'd let the group know before the first pull and ask if anyone else is going to roll need on it. If nothing else it'll show everyone your intent, and put anyone on display who (at the consensus of the group) isn't playing by what you'd consider to be fair.<br />
<br />
[...] To bring one more to the table (or reiterate one, I haven't read all 20 pages), and it's one that is a big reason why the system works as it does: if only tanks can roll on tank gear, then it becomes really hard for anyone else to build up the gear they need to be able to tank. We would end up with a bunch of undergeared tanks (&quot;Sorry guys, but this is the only way I can get armor,&quot;) or worse, fewer tanks in the system overall because nobody can get gear. People would be forced to gear for healing or tanking through other means because they wouldn't be able to move fluidly from leveling as DPS to Dungeon Finder and begin acquiring the gear they need to fulfill their role. Or, the Light forbid, one day someone decides they want to try healing or tanking and needs to begin building a set.<br />
<br />
At some point systems become so 'helpful' that they're a detriment. For that reason we have to reach a point where we're making sure we're stopping the majority of negatives, but not squeezing the egg of problems so hard that we create four messier ones.

<br />
Add need for MS and OS buttons and &quot;unique item&quot;-like mechanic, that would prevent people from rolling need for MS on item if they already have the same or better one in slot. And don't say that &quot;tank isn't my main spec, but I like to go to dung as tank cuz I don't want to wait at 40 min queue - so I'll roll dps gear&quot;. MS in that case - is a spec you specify when queuing to LFD. And yes, I think ppl who queued as specific spec to LFD has a priority to roll on &quot;their&quot; type of gear. And only if they don't need this item - only then other specs may roll for OS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least this time with the new function, people will start quitting with the need rolling on BoE's that their class can use, but is not an upgrade.<br />
So now we wont have to end up either rolling against another one who doesn't need it, when you need it and its an upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
It all seems fine for me, and I'm all in for it, however. I hope this only counts for the Need roll as stated, and not also for Greed rolling. As people should still be able to win an BoE on a Greed roll and sell it on AH, as winning it on a Greed roll is nothing but fair for everyone.<br />
<br />
And for someone who asked if the T11 would still be available for JP, i think it will, yes. However, i don't want to say anything specific as i am not 100% sure.<br />

Ranged is a hunter's primary damage weapon... All relics and wands and thrown weapons are are stat boosters.<br />

<br />
<br />
Having been in that video (as Rainbowcrash), phase 1 and 2 are pretty much a complete joke right now. The only hard part about the fight is that the adds during the transition phase are bugged. Once they start to slow down, it's near impossible for melee to hit them, because their model is ahead/behind where they actually are.<br />
<br />
@Other people complaining about our DPS: Since pets try to go behind the boss, they keep outranging their master and despawning. Also, damage meters on the PTR are FUCKED. We all do 25-35k(fight dependent) on Live.</div></div><hr />

Finally, I can get a thrown weapon on my rogue that won't be stolen by tard warriors who think their main stat is AGI, not STR. -.-<br />

&quot;tard warriors&quot; are rolling on your AGI thrown weapons because STR ranged weapons are far from abundant. The vast majority of ranged weapons - thrown and otherwise - are AGI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old valor gear becomes for sale for JP, yes, and I assume that includes Tier 11, but what about the Tier 11 pieces that require a token, ie shoulder and helmet?<br />
<br />
Will they still require a token or are they for sale with JP now?<br />
<br />
So far, it has only been 359 gear that has been made easier to obtain, whether through the VP-JP conversion or the normal raid nerfs.<br />
<br />
The H T11 tokens are Heroic raid drops, as well as being 372 gear. I doubt you'd be able to get 372 through Justice points (at least, not until the raid after Firelands is released).</div></div><hr />

is that a mistake? or does that one relic really cost more then the others? i can hardly imagen that<br />
<br />
also a confiirmend info on Ilvl 359 head and shoulder T11 pieces would be really nice. JP ? tokens ?<br />
what ever it is thou they will be easier to obtain since the bosses that drop the tokens will be nerfed</div></div><hr />

If only tanks can roll on tank gear, then it becomes really hard for anyone else to build up the gear they need to be able to tank.<br />
Tanks rolling on dps gear makes it harder for dps to gear up and dps rolling on tank gear makes it harder for tanks to gear up.<br />
<br />
Lets say you kill a raid boss and a tank item drops, who deserves it more? The mage, the rogue, the other dps or the tank?<br />
<br />
Thats why only tanks should be allowed to roll on tank gear and dps on dps gear, if the tank hits greed/disenchant/pass, then and only then would the need button unlock for the other plate-wearing dpsers.</div></div><hr />

Presumably it will be the same as when they first did all the conversions from badges to points. If the conversion puts you over the cap, then you get all the points you just can't earn any more until you are below the cap again</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I think this is the case now, the first conversion from badges to points actually converted any excess badges that would push you over the 4000 JP cap into gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not recall any mention of excess VP being converted into gold if you more than what would bring you to 4000 JP after the conversion.<br />
<br />
As such, One would assume you can go over the JP cap of 4000 once your remaining VP are converted at the onset of a new tier.</div></div><hr />

We would end up with a bunch of undergeared tanks (&quot;Sorry guys, but this is the only way I can get armor,&quot;) or worse, fewer tanks in the system overall because nobody can get gear. People would be forced to gear for healing or tanking through other means because they wouldn't be able to move fluidly from leveling as DPS to Dungeon Finder and begin acquiring the gear they need to fulfill their role. Or, the Light forbid, one day someone decides they want to try healing or tanking and needs to begin building a set.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't want people to tank that are too lazy to get the gear the real way, if I can get tanking gear in 2 days without rolling on any tank gear in heroics, anyone can. There are plenty of 359 epic tank items for rep and countless stuff on the AH and JP vendor.<br />
<br />
Although nobody has ninjad anything thous far in cata, most people ask if the tank/heal/dps needs it and if they don't they roll. Maybe they finally realized it is not a good idea to piss off tanks just because you MAY in the FUTURE tank a little (and probably fail and return to DPS).</div></div><hr />

And still do.<br />

Even though you can buy tier 7 and 8 pieces with JP now, only the 2 pieces you could originally buy with badges are still the only ones you can buy with badges (now points). You have to kill raid bosses to get full tier 7 and 8.<br />

We dont really even get a meaningful choice on the stats on it, its just practically 1 choice for everyone from valor points.<br />
<br />
I guess designing fun items isnt in style anymore.<br />

The choose to put relics as emblem items so they don't need to spread it trough bosses.

once a warrDPS needed a tankthingy in BRC normal, i was in gearing progress on my bloodDK, he pulled 500dps throughout the instance and won it.</div></div><hr />

There are pleny of Str ranged wpns avail to them for use tanking and dpsing. It just takes a little work, and if you're that impatient that you'd rather buy an agility ranged weapon, you make the rest of the Warrior nation wish you'd reroll. Proper stats far &gt; taking an agil item just for the ilvl. 4 2v2 arena wins at 0 rating = thrown wpn with str on it that's nearly identical to the BoE Carbine gun. It's like when I see people in Zul Pugs asking if they can need on leather (as a hunter) or cloth (as a druid), which would mean breaking their armor bonus for their class. Makes no sense at all, some people just see purple and marginally higher ilvl and get stupid.<br />

RE: VP conversion making your JP go over the 4k cap: I hope they do this, but at the same time if you're planning on buying things with JP that you can get with VP, you might as well buy them with VP now because the cost won't change. And if you are hoping to buy tradeskill mats or something, it's really not worth saving 4k VP just for a few stacks of herbs or ore or what have you, it would take you far less time to farm the mats than it did to get the VP. And if you've already purchased everything you could possibly want with VP for MS and OS's, well then you probably don't care if the conversion goes over cap or not. :)</div></div><hr />

It'd be kind of ridiculous if they gave a ranged slot to Hunters from VP. That'd be akin to giving a melee class a weapon slot rather than giving a wand to a caster. The ranged weapon is the most important for a Hunter, DPS and stats. A wand's dps doesn't matter at all, it's merely a stat stick. I'd be pretty angry if Hunters could get their main weapon from VP...</div></div><hr />

The articles states the price of the blue gear is the same. Yes, it makes most of it obsolete and nobody will buy it, there are also some slots where you can buy a 346, but there is no 359 available. Still doubtful that people would buy them though.</div></div><hr />

You go in there as a tank, you don't get priority on DPS plate/leather. You queue as DPS, you don't get tank shit. (Unless of course the tank or DPS already has the item in question.) If I'm in there on my tree I'm not snapping up all of the rogue/kitty leather when there's a rogue or cat in the party. It's common fucking courtesy, not someone going AMG THIS OTHER WARRIOR MIGHT NEED ON MY PLATE PIECE. If there are two DPS plate wearers in the party (although I thought the DF was going to try to not do that anymore), tough tits, you're going to have to roll against someone. But tanks and healers shouldn't be scooping up off-spec gear away from DPS that need it and vice-versa. End of fucking list.<br />

That art is also amazing. Ahhhh, Chess Event and Moroes. Now those were the days. And Nightbane, where I wiped my first raid by playing in &quot;Yakkity Sax&quot; over vent, thus causing 85% of the raid to die from laughing so hard. Good times, good times.</div></div><hr />

Someone might need to update you from news from about 4 years ago.. But players can now buy raid gear using currency they obtain doing only 5 man dungeons.

Are your current VPs converted and *added* to your current JPs? Or do your VPs become JPs and your JPs converted to gold or something?<br />
<br />
This is my big question to. My goal is to try to get all my alts up to 4000 JP by the time 4.2 hits. There is a lot of debate on what happens to current JP, and what happens if you do keep your JP but the sum of VP and JP puts you over 4000. Do yo keep current JP, does the sum of VP and JP give you a soft cap where you can go over 4000, but not be able to earn more?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There needs to be a 4th button added to rolls. ´need for offspec´ that lights up for people who can equip and use the gear, but who aren´t currently in that role. The problem with the system now is if I need an item for my offspec, I have no option except to roll NEED, or to roll greed against everyone else who is going to disenchant it. Sorry, but especially in PUGs, there is just no time for ´discussion´.. especially in ZA for the people that don´t realize that the bear will be the new bronze drake in a month.<br />
<br />
The other problem is that ´courtesy´is disappearing. I used to be really careful about what I roll need on. But after countless times seeing people roll need on gear they didn´t need... so after awhile, you yourself just stop being courteous. I am basically a ´if it lights up, click it´ player now. Nobody ever calls you out for being a ninja, except for BOE items.. which I always wait til last to roll on. If everyong rolls greed, I do too.</div></div><hr />

It isn´t that obvious. There was also a patch in there where they implemented a soft cap and allowed you to go OVER the 4000 cap. You just couldn´t earn more until you spent yourself below the cap again. They have done it like 3 different ways already.. there has been no blue mention how it will be done this time. We know VP is getting changed to JP, but we don´t know if all our JP is getting converted to gold (happened already), if the 4000jp cap is enforced and we get gold for excess (already happened) or if there is a soft cap (already happened).

<br />
You may say it is obvious that excess of 4000 gets converted to Gold, but I still think there is a better chance they do the soft cap.

If you want your shiny 4piece bonus or full set, go faceroll yourself through retardedly easy raid content to get it. As it is now with how easy it is to get VP and beating on the BH loot pinata for possible tier drops, those 2 pieces kept as token drops makes the most sense... you should have to put in a little effort. Just a little, though, and you can handle it, I promise. <br />
<br />
Also, you guys having fits over the loot in dungeons.. Just make it clear what you need when you go in and ask if others will be rolling the same. My tank alts gear is pretty crappy so I make it clear I'm there to gear up. When we pug with LFG finder and get into an instance with optional bosses, we generally ask if anyone there needs stuff from them so we can make sure to hit them. No one is going to know you want your loot unless you tell them, just assuming loot should be yours is far too entitled if you're just going to be passive aggressive about making your gear needs known. I've pugged raids and it's always been understood well before we're even in the instance that you need for MS, greed for OS, and if no one needs a BoE, its a free roll. Even been in pugs where everyone has agreed to give it to someone because their alt needs it. Must have just awesome people on Stormreaver, I guess. Granted, I mostly raid with the guild I'm in, and any BoE that isn't needed by someone in the raid at the time, goes to someone in the guild who does need it.</div></div><hr />

Don´t they do off-hand daggers and swords? that is like half the solution. But yeah, they should probably make an AGI staff that is hunter only. But in reality, don´t hunters have a really easy time getting their melee weapons. There are always a ton of agi swords and daggers littering up the drop tables.<br />

nope. Been playing since before they added dire maul. <br />
We used to have dozens of different tokens and it took blizzard years to realise how stupid it was.<br />
They had stuff you could only buy with AV tokens, stuff you could only buy with AB tokens etc - it was ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Now they've changed the honor system to reward far too much. I got a full set of bg gear in less than a week. <br />
When they added the possibility to exchange honor for justice a few weeks ago, i had a full set of that pve gear in under a week. So the situation is that within 2-3 weeks people literally have nothing to buy - nothing! because you have all of it.<br />
<br />
The system has always been wrong and it still is. Why can people who have never done any pvp at all get access to better pvp gear than someone who can play 24/7 non rated bgs, simply because they can purchase tokens ? <br />
<br />
If a raider spends 3 hours doing a raid and you need 2 raids to buy an item for lets say 1000 tokens (500 rewarded each reset), then why not let someone who is not in a raiding guild and only has access to heroics buy the same item but that they only get rewarded 100 tokens each reset? They are putting more effort in while maintaining the level they choose to play - same with honor. If thats not acceptable then giving people access to pvp gear for valor is also not acceptable - get off your ass and do some pvp for the gear.</div></div><hr />

You misunderstand how class balancing is being done, or ignore it. Class dps (or healing or whatever) is balanced on how the classes actually work, not on some weird &quot;this is the dps they would have if they had better gear than exists&quot;. Yes, some classes maybe get 40-67 points less in a primary stat, but those classes are balanced around the dps they do without those 40-67 points. Basically, you get 40-67 less stats, but one of your main spells get to do 0.5% (or whatever the number is) more damage than it would have without those 40-67 points. If they added those 40-57 more stats to the classes you mention, they would also have to nerf them some other way to compensate.<br />
<br />
The whole point of &quot;balancing&quot; is to allow different classes to be at least somewhat different, yet in the end be equal. They don't have to be identical to be equal.<br />
<br />
There is too much homogenization as it is. Let different classes be different (while still balanced).</div></div><hr />

If only tanks can roll on tank gear, then it becomes really hard for anyone else to build up the gear they need to be able to tank.<br />
Tanks rolling on dps gear makes it harder for dps to gear up and dps rolling on tank gear makes it harder for tanks to gear up.<br />
<br />
Lets say you kill a raid boss and a tank item drops, who deserves it more? The mage, the rogue, the other dps or the tank?<br />
<br />
Thats why only tanks should be allowed to roll on tank gear and dps on dps gear, if the tank hits greed/disenchant/pass, then and only then would the need button unlock for the other plate-wearing dpsers.<br />
<br />
Be careful what you wish for. My DK tank is 12/12 experience and has 359 tank gear all around. I'm filling in holes in my dps gear. I can queue as tank, roll on a plate dps piece that I need, and provide a smooth ZG/ZA run for the group.... or I can not queue. What I'm not going to do is spend 30 minutes in a queue right now for an offspec - especially when the system needs tanks. With all the complaining that dps does about queue times, I'd think you'd be ok rolling fair and square against someone else. <br />
<br />
Comparing raid kills &amp; loot to 5man kills and loot is an apples to oranges comparison.</div></div><hr />

It is entirely possible to tank in dps gear or gear up with offspec roles (as tanks can gear up very quickly) so the only presented argument shows a complete lack of understanding of not only how LFD works to gear up more needed roles more quickly but also of laughable gearing requirements for any normals. This is a slap in the face to players that actually try to show some respect with looting and wanted other's to do so as well. The only thing I can think is that more paying customers are interested in ninjaing... but that isn't exactly sustainable. <br />
<br />
I wish Blizzard, or Activison, or whoever would consider what kind of players that are catering to and the long term impacts on the game and the community of, for example, supporting ninja looting, removing vote kick privilege from many players, removing the necessity of basic understanding of game mechanics to receive current tier gear (normal mode), and otherwise completely removing performance incentives from any part of the game other than hardmode raiding (I think, I don't raid hardmodes) or high end pvp.</div></div><hr />

I have two very well geared tanks who I would like to dps on, I have to farm heroics to get that gear quickly. Why should I not be able to roll need on dps gear when that's what I'm there for? What then? I shouldn't queue as tank? Even though I am a god damn spectacular tank? I should just queue as dps and then get people trolling me because of my low dps because I don't have gear? Or I should have to spend my hard earned gold on the auction house and buy some dps gear or something?<br />
<br />
What if I rolled a druid tank? What would happen then? Would I be unable to need roll on gear I need until the rogues and kitty druids and hunters/enhance shamans passed on the stuff?<br />
<br />
If you honestly think people should be disallowed from rolling on gear their class can use because of their spec you are a very stupid person to say the least.<br />
<br />
I mean come on let me get this straight, (pretty sure this is accurate but I want to get a confirmation on this) this is all happening because some whiny faggot piece of shit retard dickhole dps that can't think his way out a of a paper bag would cry about me, the fucking badass tank running heroics to get my dps set going, letting his fail ass have all the tank gear (which he probably would've rolled need on anyways) for free? Oh hell no, fuck that faggot and anyone that sympathizes with him. <br />
<br />
And by the way since there are people who are still unclear on this IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO NINJA LOOT IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT. Please stop fucking using terms that you do not understand the meaning of. Ninja loot is NOT need rolling on geasr that you can use but isn't for your main spec. Ninja loot is being a master looter and promising that loot rules will be a certain way and then deciding to gear up your friend instead when that piece of gear you were after drops. That is ninja loot. Blizzard refers to this as LOOT SCAMMING and it is a bannable offense. Need rolling on gear for your off spec in a fair need before green loot system is perfectly fine and if you don't like it you need to get friends and have them run with you.<br />
<br />
You do not get dibs on gear. Gear does not belong to you. You are just another person in the group. You should stop being so god damn selfish if you think you deserve to have loot handed to you just for choosing a specific role (which you might in fact be terrible at). If you wish to change it so you can have dibs on gear get your friends to run heroics with you. End of discussion.</div></div><hr />

Why should I not be able to roll need on dps gear when that's what I'm there for? What then? I shouldn't queue as tank? Even though I am a god damn spectacular tank? I should just queue as dps and then get people trolling me because of my low dps because I don't have gear?<br />
<br />
If you want to roll on dps gear, queue as dps. Simple as that. That plate dps'er that you want to roll against most likely had to site though a 40 minute queue, just to encounter a dbag rolling outside his/her spec. Meanwhile you are just exploiting your quick queue times as a tank so that you can quickly get dps gear.<br />
<br />
In ZA/ZG I've tanked, melee dps'ed, ranged dps'ed and healed. Each time I roll on the stuff I queued as. Why? Because I'm not a jerk.</div></div><hr />

Will it be the same trend as T11 - 3 pieces for VPs and 2 pieces via tokens dropped by end boses or something different? Yep the tokens will remain</div></div><hr />
