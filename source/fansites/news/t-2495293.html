Thank you very much to everyone who’ve helped test the closed beta for WoW Classic. Over the last seven weeks, we have reviewed over 17000 bug reports from testers. These led to our verification of hundreds of new and unique bugs. Your efforts have directly contributed to making WoW Classic a better experience for everyone when it opens to the world on August 27.<br />
<br />
We have now reached a stage where WoW Classic is in a good state for reconciling remaining issues, and we intend to shift our focus away from the closed beta, which will end on July 12.<br />
<br />
Internally, we’re working through the aforementioned bug fixes, testing the high-level zones such as Eastern Plaguelands, and doing our raid testing. We’ll make sure Ragnaros and Onyxia are ready to go.<br />
<br />
As for what’s next, the final stress test is now coming up on July 25-26 (we’ve changed this date since we first announced it). During that global test, we will roll out our multi-region hardware in preparation for the worldwide release of WoW Classic. In addition to getting many more testers to play through the initial leveling experiences, it will be a test of the fixes and tweaks that we’ve made and are making to the game.<br />
<br />
We’re planning a small in-game event to end the closed beta on July 12. We’ll see you there, and we’ll post reminders for you just before the stress test, as well as reminders in August as we gather for name reservations and ultimately for the release of WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully this final stress test will extend invitations to lots of people who didn't get to participate yet.</div></div><hr />

There is a hype that has gone down a bit since the first beta and needs to have a rest up. A month and a half without will make people want it more, will bring back the views on streamers.</div></div><hr />

This all said i kinda wish beta was shorter or they just did 1 zone at a time rather than all in 1 go. Also the hype seems to have died down since every streamer out there seems to have been doing nothing but streamning classic for what seems a long time its kinda stale now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hype can die down all it wants, it’s of no consequence to me if a bunch of people decide to spoil themselves watching streamers.</div></div><hr />

Just curious: did you make sure you selected &quot;Classic WoW&quot; as your desired beta interests? Classic WoW is separate from current WoW in those listings.</div></div><hr />

Haha. Good one :D<br />
<br />
Could be old style GM event, like GM appearing and spawning stuff. Saw that once in vanilla, would love to see that again.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with 8.2.</div></div><hr />

Srsly why are you jealous? It's good PR and whatever these streamers do is being recorded (and watched by thousands of fans), so they're pretty much the best possible beta testers even if they don't write any reports. I mean as it's the case in any beta: 99% of the players would be totally useless anyways for a beta test. They'd either just test around stuff for themselves or they'd fuck with these streamers.<br />
<br />
It's also the only time where these big streamers can &quot;legit&quot; play and stream Classic, because when Classic launches they're gonna be constantly surrounded with hordes of people trying to be seen on stream.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because a server with several thousand players are all streamers. lmao</div></div><hr />

Despite the level cap being 30 and way later upped to 40 it's maintained a pretty healthy playerbase. After a week at 30 things got stale. After a week at 40 they did too. The lowering playerbase during a dead period of character advancement is in no way an indication of how the game is going to perform. The first couple weeks before a majority were hitting level cap it was always buzzing and streams were always high viewership for it.<br />
<br />
Confusing the lack of content when capped at 30 and 40 with interest in the game is either a bad troll or stupidity. I would guess the latter if you actually think it's going to fail.</div></div><hr />
