Will be interesting to see how the new Seal of Justice change works out but to be quite honest it looks like they're fixing the Ret Paladin issue (Low sustained/High burst damage) with...more burst. Plenty of other things to take into considering, such as how it will work with Divine Purpose and so on.</div></div><hr />

Shadow is receiving massive nerfs in pvp. They won't be a worry this patch. The pvp single target was needed.</div></div><hr />

Not likely, remember they announced plans to gain reputations more easily by awarding rep in LFD and Scenarios... this could just be a consolidated way of choosing the faction you'd like to boost without having to pick from a drop down menu every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its really good for alts (especially if the Grand Commendations affect these bonuses) since a second grind through the same story line is not fun for everyone. Keep in mind this is a BONUS ~1100 rep or so, stack that with dailies and you'd be honored to exalted in less than a week, assuming you have grand commendations.</div></div><hr />

agree with that... frost mage are already hitting like a truck atm. About SS buff... would be good if they actually buff Unholy, damage wise</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to call you out, and I could have missed it, but how are SPriests going to be so much different from how they are in 5.2.</div></div><hr />

Healing for all but 90 talents are reduced by 25% (excluding V. Embrace I believe). Phantasm no longer makes you untargetable. Dispersion will be an actual shadow spell; if you're silenced/locked out you wont be able to disperse and float away. There may be more I'm forgetting but those are the big ones.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong but I believe they canceled the healing nerf.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong, I think it's great that they attempt to make i.e. old instances playworthy again and not long forgotten, that's, imo, pretty cool. But can't they at least make some new gear and not stick to the old god damn gear? Perhaps it's just me. Besides the criticism I'm looking forward to the new patch, I hope you guys are as well.</div></div><hr />

You must be refering from a stand point of PvP because shadow is weak when it comes to single target PvE. This MB increase will help tremendously without making it too OP since restricted by a cd and not a constant ability.</div></div><hr />

Also, S.priest DAMAGE in pvp isn't even that great... it's their utility as off-healers and evaders that people complain most about.</div></div><hr />
