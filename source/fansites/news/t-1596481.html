Some of these changes are simply amazing. Not that i have something against druids, but they keep buffing the class thats already topping the meters. I dont like the idea of raids composed from druids only, but how they started &quot;fine tuning,&quot; every other class will end up just as an alt, maining the druid will not be a choise.<br />
<br />
<br />
We had &quot;The Age of Mages&quot; while Ghostclawer was main dev, we all know that he was maining a mage.. I guess that some of devs in Blizz are playing a druid..</div></div><hr />

Actually he stated that he played mainly priest as he was leaving Blizzard.<br />

And obviously some of the devs play druids, as they play all other classes lol.</div></div><hr />

As always and with everything else from last expansion blizzard consider last expansion stuff &quot;legacy&quot; so some restrictions needed to be made.<br />
Why do you think that they will fuk up enchanters? Did you ment that noone will buy old enchants cause of their restriction?<br />
Ilvl 600 is something that you will have late game, around lvl 98-99, maybe even 100 before you hit HCs, so i dont see the issue with those restrictions. Look at it as something like this:&quot;you can level however you want with whatever gear/enchants you want, however once you max out you need to be a bit more serious and prepare for content ahead.&quot; Same applies to HCs for which you will be granted access only when you win Proving Grounds Silver.<br />
<br />
<br />
.... And obviously some of the devs play druids, as they play all other classes lol.<br />
<br />

Oh I'm not talking about stats, I'm talking about the fact that when I level enchanting I tend to just spam w/e enchant gives most points on my gear (given my enchanter is my alt so it doesn't usually get luxurious proper enchants until I can be bothered).<br />
<br />
So if a new person levels enchantment at level 100 they wont be able to spam some of those enchants on their gear for skill points. It's purely annoyance and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Why do you do this still: Enchanting Vellum is available since years, you can still put the enchants in the vellums and maybe even sell them; or give them to new players: the vellum is so cheap it's not even fun to create them with inscription, so no, it's not an annoyance, it is necessary to keep the enchanting-restrictions in WoD without removing older enchants from gear.</div></div><hr />

Quest will remain the in the questlog for those who have it when 6.0 hits, and if you don't have your cloak yet, after 2 years, then well, it's nobody's fault, especially not blizzard's. If you however mean that you won't get to &quot;enjoy&quot; the cloak before the expac, you will get some use out of it while leveling and during the first few dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Technically a few is 3....and 3 weeks from now sounds pretty accurate for PTR to be released as WoD release is roughly 7 weeks away.</div></div><hr />

It's times like these I wish I had a beta key so I could get a better feel for how garrisons are going to work. No matter how many things I read, its hard to translate that into actual gameplay without experiencing it first. Dungeon journal is the same way. <br />
<br />
The expansion is certainly shaping up to be World Of Garrisons ...</div></div><hr />

And they were still right considering &quot;a few weeks away&quot; has been said for the past two weeks.<br />

Garrison can be done slightly faster than the farm depending how many followers you have.</div></div><hr />

Wowhead's got an overview for all the professions, here's the link directly to the Archaeology bit (http://www.wowhead.com/guide=2327#archaeology). May be outdated slightly, but there are a few rare solves for pets/toys/BoAs.</div></div><hr />
