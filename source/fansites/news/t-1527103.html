<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sopa</div><div class="date">2014-05-29, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha, haters gonna hate but alliance just looks better xD. Besides, horde bike just seems that its already in game. Honestly, they should just make both bikes available as a &quot;surprise&quot; to all the fans and players. But hey, that may just be wishful thinking from my side. I don't like that they don't have round wheels and instead using tank treads tho.<br />
But this is what i think:<br />
<br />
Treads in both bikes kind of sucked, in horde it made much more sense.<br />
<br />
Horde definitely is not as imposing as it should had been, tusks should had been darker color and bigger. Same with the sides, the spikes should had been bigger as well. Horde bike should had looked dangerous to even use it.<br />
<br />
Alliance sword shaped front ended up being the best part. It does indeed look buggy like if you think about it too much. And perhaps too many details with gold, ended up making those details that would had looked amazing just common with all the borders opaquing them.<br />
<br />
Either way! Voting alliance!</div></div><hr />

that joke got old even when it made sense. It doesn't make sense here. Samwise doesn't even work on WoW. He's the lead artist of SC2. And Chris Metzen is a higher up that doesn't work on the nitty gritty. He approves storylines that the quest team makes to verify that they are cannon. Their involvement in the project was almost nil. All they did was make a few phone calls and receive a few. And take one small trip out to see the bikes.</div></div><hr />

Now I'm not hating on the Alliance bike with I think the body looks pretty cool but I think they are lacking without actual wheels. As well I honestly hate the sword front fender and think it was a poor choice, if it were me as a bike guy I would have added a front fender that was like a big metal lions half head with the bike wheel coming out of its mouth. But I guess we will all see soon enough and maybe Blizzard will take creative control and make the in game bikes without the treads on the Alliance bike at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry alliance fans, but your bike looks more like the bastard child of a snowmobile and an overgrown slug than an actual chopper.<br />
<br />
The horde bike does a far better job at capturing the feel of a badass bike. Personally, I think tank threads are really tacky, and the fact that the alliance one has them on both sides screams to me that they were trying WAAAAAAAAY too hard.<br />
<br />
So, Horde FTW. I'm voting for mine ASAP.<br />

No point in voting, they will be giving us both bikes.<br />

I agree, the paint job was a downgrade. The metal trim in the final version looks like those foam swords/armor you can buy in gift shops. I am not saying the Horde bike is great. I'm saying the Alliance one is flat out bad. The Horde one is passable and I'd maybe ride it, but the Alliance one... I wouldn't ride it even if it was free :(</div></div><hr />

The tusks on the Horde bike honestly look stupid to me, if they were going after a similar look to the zeppelins then the tusks needed to be more forward-facing. I would have much rather they made the tusks part of the handlebars, make it look like Garrosh's shoulder armor.</div></div><hr />

You're right actually, the treads on the trike do work in a way, and the more I look at it, the more I like the horde trike.<br />

<br />
I really like aspects of both builds, but as a whole I don't think either bike managed to hit it out of the park.....not even sure they got it out of the infield.<br />
<br />
The Alliance bike has Bling, I dig the handle bar swords and even the front facing &quot;tusk&quot; swords. I agree with Blizz concern that it looks a bit too bug like, although i really like the effect as a whole. I think the lowered and long looking back end works even if I am not huge on the treads, but quite frankly the front tread is just on another level of bad. The shield on the front end sticks out and doesn't really flow at all, despite working in theme.<br />
<br />
The horde bike overall fits the tread theme much better, but honestly.. its not a chopper. I loved the idea of the tusks, but don't feel they really came out as good as I had envisioned. The handlebars on the horde bike are plain jane and do nothing for me. I think the Shoulder pads fenders turned out quite well and I really like the gas tank.<br />
<br />
in terms of which one feels more like its faction, I would have to say Horde by a good margin... but when it comes to overall looks I think Alliance one has to take my vote.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also something I knew would happen, the turn radius on the Alliance bike is horribly huge. Watch the end of the episode when they ride the bikes out of the shop. they guy is straining as hard as he can to make it turn at all. There's a reason real vehicles don't generally have tracks/treads on the front. In the back or a pair in parallel like on a tank sure, but not on the front.</div></div><hr />

Either right away saying &quot;The vote was so close we added both so as to keep everyone happy.&quot;<br />
Or wait a month or so after the winning bike is added add the alliance(heheh) bike into the game.<br />
<br />
Nope. They won't squander an opportunity to make fun of the entire Alliance fanbase when they inevitably lose. They'll have the full Nelson Muntz laughing at the Alliance's misery treatment!<br />

Also, Horde fans will probably mass rally to get votes like what fans did to vote Josh Wise into the NASCAR All-Star Race.</div></div><hr />

The front half looks a bit weak in comparison. If each bike looked as good as those fenders all over then maybe I'd be drooling. Voting Alliance because I like the shape of it better, even though I'm pretty sure the voting thing is just a gimmick. Not gonna be surprised when they put both into the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Alliance one looks like a metal slug - and what the hell is with all the catapillar tracks? That's not a bike.. it's a balled-up snowmobile.<br />
<br />
Such bad form from both teams.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the effort on the Horde bike, and I think the external metal/decor has more weight to it.. but why they're incapable of making proper bikes with two wheels I have no idea.<br />
<br />
Horde will win.. but only because the Alliance one is worse.. not because it's any good.<br />
<br />
Part of me hopes that the vote-count is low to the point that they realise they're both bollocks... <br />
<br />
If only there was a 'Meh' button.<br />
<br />
The good news is that the in-game models can't possibly look as bad as the real things. lol<br />
<br />
I thought the exact same thing about the alliance bike, looks like a slug and its not a chopper, but a snowmobile. I agree with you that Horde will win, but only because their bike is not as bad as the Alliance.</div></div><hr />

If not for that reason, then for the very simple reason that they CAN'T have one more mount on one faction without there being a massive outcry, for good reasons ofc, one faction shouldn't have more mounts than the other.</div></div><hr />

lets be realistic that was the ONLY option from the beginning. If one race got a mount and the other didn't it would be so retarded its not even funny the outrage would be massive especially since blizz knows that horde is like 55-45 over alliance by default right now.

The alliance bike just has no body to it and if put into the game it's just going to look like another straight line mount. It needed more bulk on the sides. As for RL design I'd agree with most people on the treads just not fitting in on the alliance bike. The horde bike has the handles and the poorly constructed foot rests bringing it down. I understand the look they were going for, but the handles just don't have that jagged raw feel of the rest of the bike and the foot rests while jagged and raw just don't visually fit in with the rest.</div></div><hr />

Coming from blizz who turned this game into world of casual craft letting Heroic boss mounts and Glory achievments be gotten years after they were relevant just to let casuals get them. Yeah no they would never not give 1 faction something. The outcry would be so funny to watch although if they did do it and had the balls to tell people to QQ off then maybe they can give us raiders back our mounts not being on every casual scrub that can farm them weekly.</div></div><hr />

Based on practical use,if u carefully watch the vid again when they drive them out of the shop,check on the guy riding the alliance bike.He is trying so hard to turn his bike that he looks like hes about to take a dump.So yeah this is why u need slim wheels to the front so u can turn easily.Not sure how both will do on the snow but i don't think they were designed for snow anyway.So another point to the horde.<br />

I think the body looks fantastic. I like the knight in shining armor vibe to it with the gold and blue trim added in for Alliance. The body looks way better than the Horde bike. The Horde bike's body looks kind of boring to me.<br />
<br />
The treads, however, really throw it off. I agree with everyone else that wheels would be better for Alliance than treads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The alliance one looks like something the klaxxi would ride through the snow.<br />
<br />
I wonder what happens to the bikes im betting Chris Metzen will take them home to impress his wife HAHA<br />
<br />
I'm sure they will be locked in a storage room at Blizzard and pulled out once in a while for promotional purposes. I'm surprised that they actually could be driven out of the garage, but it ends there, right, these things cant possibly be street legal?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh well. I must say that they both look good and a little disappointing at the same time. The front treads on the alliance bike looks misplaced, but the rest looks fantastic. If they had used a normal wheel, I think my vote would go to it. The horde bike has some very badass features, and the paint job is amazing, it looks cartoonish in real life. The only drawback is that it's a bit messy, and I think the wooden parts are too light, and that the &quot;tusks&quot; should have a bone color instead if the wood. Neither of these bikes will be something I would use in-game since I don't embrace the steampunk side of WoW as much, so I'm not concerned about the outcome of the vote, however, I would vote for the horde bike myself. It has a slight edge since the alliance bike has those front treads.<br />
<br />
This was a cool project, but I'm not sure why either of them needs to be made into in-game mounts. The designers could do a better job at making something from fantasy, than recreating a machine that exists in real life, and the enforced realism that it dictates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alliance bike looks still like a bug, with those blades at the front it reminds me of an ant and it looks not agile and knightish enough. Normal wheels would have been way better for the alliance bikes, so it looks faster and therefore more dangerous as it is not especially bulky.<br />
<br />
Horde bike is also boring, where is the skull over the front wheel? It looks incredibly empty. For the trike look its also not bulky enough as it really looks like the trikes already ingame it just doesn't give the feeling of a dangerous war machine.<br />
<br />
Also it is generally halfassed. Either you make it practical or you make it look awesome and overdesigned so you have one theme really flashed out. But some parts just look/ are really unpractical and the design isn't fully on the bike, just parts colored and themed a bit making them look rather empty.<br />
<br />
Not gonna vote, because I don't bother having one. <br />
Liked the original alliance idea more as I like more to have a mount incorporating speed and agility rather than having a pseudo siege weapon bulldozing pointlessly over the map. That gives me the sense of being just brutal and dumb. It can look hordish and orcish without losing the look of actually being a bike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I've kept myself from weighing in for mostly one reason. The two bikes have significantly different art styles which clashes too hard with how they will be judged. The Alliance bike, as silly as that front tread looks, is made to look realistic. While the horde bike, which I will admit is pretty beast looking, looks as though it is a high-proly model for WoW; which results in a number of things, especially those back &quot;shoulder pad fenders&quot;, look like plastic. From an artistic standpoint, I really like the horde bike because it keeps with the warcraft art style, rather then going for a &quot;Real-life&quot; equivalent. The main reason I dislike the horde bike is that it's an embossed remodeled goblin trike.<br />
<br />
On the topic of treads. Frankly I could give a thin one what people think, but the thing is <br />

Agree. I also think it's stupid that they have the words HORDE and ALLIANCE emblazoned across the side. If you have to label it, you didn't capture the theme well enough; scrap and redo.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance bike looks like a Nerubian that joined the Alliance. I don't like either one, but the Horde obviously wins.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance bike awkward and the Horde one looked like a toy. I don't know, I'm not gonna bitch about getting a free mount, but I don't understand how either faction can get excited about these.<br />

And Sam Didier is the most cringeworthy human being I've ever seen in a video of anything.</div></div><hr />

The alliance bike doesn't even look like it can function. <br />
<br />
Riding on a dragon = more believable than riding on that alliance bike. Dignity, Blizzard please have some dignity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
This has cost us a content patch<br />
<br />
A content patch that was never planned to happen to begin with? This hasn't cost us anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...You do realize this is a fantasy game with Gnomes, Undead, and Night Elves, and Tauren, right? So the handling of a bike in real life, isn't going to transfer to the game...<br />
<br />
Anyways. I'm torn. I like the design of the Alliance one, but I like the coloring of the Horde...I know both bikes will end up in the game, but I don't want to vote Horde simply because I play Horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least the Horde one has flavor that makes it look like a game model, the tusks looks like terrible cheap wood, other than that, I actually like the Horde one.<br />
<br />
But the Alliance one, it's embarrassing, it just honestly looks terrible, take the alliance sigil off it and go ask people what it's supposed to look like, they won't say alliance, do it for the horde bike, and they would say the horde, the shoulder pads are perfect.<br />
<br />
I only play Alliance, sadly.<br />
<br />
Funny how neither are really bikes, nor choppers...</div></div><hr />
