Invincible.MP3 on Rapidshare (http://rapidshare.com/files/339682072/invincible.mp3)<br />
<br />
This is also a great opportunity to embed the video of Invincible (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/72286/invincible/). This is NOT an official video and it was taken during the Patch 3.3 PTRs, the mount might be different on live servers. At this time I suspect that it will be slightly more impressive on live servers, I'm currently investigating and will let you know if something new comes up. <br />

PvP Resilience Change - Server Restart<br />
There was some confusion on our end so here is the clarification on this change going live.<br />
<br />
The hotfix is live, but it requires a server restart before it will actually affect your gear. Some of your realms have been restarted for various reasons, but some have not. They will all get restarted at the next maintenance period (typically Tuesday AM in the US). We might go ahead and restart all servers just so that we know everyone is having the same experience. <br />
<br />

Crit damage after the Resilience buff<br />
I don't *think* I missed the point, and I'll restate my point again. PvP excessively rewards focusing on crits because kills, not damage, are generally what win those fights for you. We think if resilience didn't affect crits than those specs that focus on crits would have an extra advantage in PvP situations as well as the value of crit in general being more useful. Nobody is really preventing crits even with max resilience. Crits will still hit for more than hits even with max resilience. In fact, most of the complaints people have about dying too quickly come from the big crits they suffered. <br />
<br />
[...] Getting a crit is valuable for every damage spec and getting crits is more valuable in PvP than in PvE. Some talent trees have mechanics that benefit from getting crits, but the fact is that you still want crit and you still want to crit more in Arena. It doesn't ever become a bad or problematic stat for you. Maybe your damage goes down a little, but I really don't think the problems Fire and Balance have in Arenas is because of their lower crit chances. We could see perhaps in a Catclysm setting of allowing offensive &quot;on crit&quot; mechanics to work the same way defensive ones do today even if resilience changed that crit into a hit. It would be a good quality of life change, but I still think the impact this has in actual games is being overstated. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748774679-resilience-requires-additional-alterations.html))<br />
<br />
Arathi Basin favors horde?<br />
We don't have any changes planned for Arathi Basin at this time. Cataclysm is still a ways off though so things could change. Just remember that not all Battlegrounds are meant to be a mirror, but if we feel there is an imbalance that is causing a problematic win-ratio, we will look into it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748775804-plans-to-better-balance-ab-in-next-expansion.html))<br />
<br />
Too many raid-wide damage auras in raid?<br />
In general, we think it's more important to the game to have diverse and interesting fights than it is to have 5 way ties for healing &quot;usefulness&quot; on every fight, just as we don't go out of our way to have melee vs. ranged dps ties on every fight, or even an even number of fights.<br />
<br />
We already place a lot of limits on our encounter designers as to whether what they want to do is fair to class balance, yet they still manage to come up with boss fights that none of us have ever seen before. Telling them they can no longer do raid-wide damage auras, or can only do them on 10% of bosses or whatever is just a restriction I don't think the game design needs. You may feel better in the short term where you're just as awesome on fight 2 as you are on fight 31, but in the long term you might lose interest in the raiding game when all the bosses start to feel the same.<br />
<br />
Here is the most important part of my post: The community tendency is to push for homogeneity (in roles, in buffs, in healing and damage, in representation, in available enchants, in awesomeness of badge items, etc.) because &quot;that's fair.&quot; We push for new, unpredictable and interesting things because it keeps players interested in the game.

Patch 3.0 buff overhaul<br />
It sometimes seems to me that players are obsessed with finding our design rules so they can then look for exceptions or inconsistencies that allow them to argue for buffs for their class. As Strawberry suggests, our goal was not to create a perfect buff / debuff matrix. Our goal was to give you much more flexibility in how you organize your raid comp. We think we’ve succeeded in that to a large degree. However, 3.0 was our first attempt at the great buff overhaul so no doubt the next iteration in 4.0 will feel even better.

Does the spell haste from Boomkin Aura stack with Wrath of Air? <br />
Currently, yes. The complexity here is we have a melee haste, a spell haste and a generic haste buff. One solution we’ve discussed is to consolidate buffs into melee or spell haste. Swift Retribution could be melee and Improved Moonkin Form could be spell. But I am just arm-waving at this point. We might go a different way with it.

Cataclysm Ammo Changes<br />
We haven't announced the Cataclysm ammo change yet, except to say that it will no longer be a consumable.<br />
<br />
The simplest solution is certainly that ammo goes away and guns, bows and crossbows just don't ever run out of ammo. More complicated features might be more exciting as you say, but have potential downsides too. Applying fire to your arrows sounds cool, but is ultimately any more interesting than just having a &quot;Fire Shot&quot; ability. Do you really conceive of a lot of situations where you'd rather do Fire damage over physical damage? Having different kinds of arrows sounds interesting until you consider the delivery mechanism of having to &quot;catch them all&quot; through rare drops, badge vendors or the like. As you say, hunters do have a lot of buttons and a pet to manage, so I'm not sure they really need a whole additional mechanic to worry about.

Offering an alternative to totems?<br />
I don’t know of a kind way to say this, but if you hate totems, then you’re playing the wrong class. We are never, ever going to offer a shaman play style that involves ignoring or marginalizing totems. We have taken steps to improve those areas where totems fall behind, and any shaman that doesn’t see the massive quality of life improvement they got with the Totem Bar is just trying to downplay the positive in order to accentuate the negative. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748795690-5-spell-haste.html))<br />
<br />
Bloodlust / Heroism<br />
Bloodlust / Heroism we're not just sure about yet. Only one class brings it, but there are three raid-viable specs in that class that all fill different roles, so it's a big difference from an ability that say only an Arms warrior or Frost DK brings. We've considered the drum angle too, but we're not 100% sold on that idea either. It is a very good buff, but overall players give it more credit for their success than it typically accounts for. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748795690-5-spell-haste.html))<br />
<br />
Totem of Wrath / Demonic Pact<br />
Totem of Wrath and Demonic Pact is something we've said before that we want to fix. They should be virtually the same buff (+spell power) and they definitely are not that now. It's a big change though, because currently Elemental shaman don't want to drop Totem of Wrath, unless they think that is the only thing getting them a raid slot, while on the other hand, Demo locks might very well vanish from raiding without their buff. None of this is ideal, but it's also not a trivial fix or we would have done it long ago. Remember it gets even more complicated in the Cataclysm time frame because Intellect (and buffs that provide +Int) also provides spell power.

Protection DPS<br />
We'll buff sustained damage in the same patch where we nerf Warbringer and the block conversion to Shield Slam. It probably won't end up being a 2000 dps increase for anyone, but it should help close the gap. <br />
<br />
Shield Slam changes<br />
Currently, the SBV you gain from Shield Block (skill) is unaffected by the diminishing returns. I'm asking if this will still be the case. <br />
The diminishing returns are applied pre Shield Block. It's the lesser of the two nerfs you mentioned. We picked a number that would only greatly affect tanks going out of their way to get really big Shield Slam crits, which is typically not the guy tanking Icecrown bosses.

<br />
If you remember the WotLK Cinematic Intro Music you can definitely recognize how similar the theme of that music is to the Invicible track.I'd say that the track has more to do with Lordaeron's former prince as you mention it rather than his mount.<br />
<br />
By the way, it seems to me that the track is a mix of WotLK Intro Music and the Lament of the Highborne.</div></div><hr />

I always thought it was alliance map, since they can get to 3 flags and horde 2 flags<br />
Alliance stable before farm/ Lumbermill before horde/ if they run over water with DK aura BS before horde.<br />
Mine is the only thing horde is pretty even in speed getting to.<br />

Mine,Farm,Bs,Lumbermill gy and flag are pretty far from each other but alliance stable gy and flag pretty close</div></div><hr />

Well, as it was stated the music &quot;pattern&quot; of the song is the same as the one of the Cinematic Intro Music.Point is that the lyrics for the latter were published with the Collector's Edition of WotLK and as it happened with all the previous WoW music piecies that contained choir the lyrics are in pseudo Latin(words that look and sound like latin but actually they dont have any actual meaning aka cant be translated) <br />
<br />

To me, the music sounds like first the innerchild (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=32497) (the child's voice and a reference to lost innocence, most likely) of Arthas is lamenting to a crowd of fallen spirits (the choir of adult voices following the child's voice) for forgiveness. Maybe even, with some wild imagination, one could think of the deep male voice which is so present in the foreground of this choir, to be his father - King Terenas Menethil II. In the conclusion of the song the child is forgiven for his actions, as the voice of the child is combined with the choir of adults.</div></div><hr />

If I say biggus dickus it's obviously pseudo-Latin, but equitus/equinus isn't, so I'll just give a shot at translating it. If someone would be kind enough to show me the text ^^ I'm really bad at understanding lyrics from classical music genres.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll see... Deathwing really does have almost as much lore behind him as Arthas does, it's just that in WC3, people got to play as Arthas, so they feel that stronger connection. If Blizz can keep building on working on ambiance.. really, there's nothing that'll match it. One thing is for sure, this music makes me more eager to face the Lich King than ever before. I really hope (despite my desire to be at least a little competitive about the kill) that none of the guilds release videos about him, because it would be required viewing before facing him in the guild... first time I see him, I really want that to be fresh.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
As for the music piece, what do you say to something like that. Aside from giving a real hats off to Glenn Stafford and the rest of the music sound department.<br />
<br />
I instantly get a mental image of this as being the crowning piece of the Lich King encounter. Arthas has fallen, Frostmourne lays shattered at his feet, and the souls of all of those he's slain are around him, like in Halls of Reflection and in the launch cinematic for 3.3. I can see Terenas's soul walking up to the Lich King's body and acting as if he's going to pick him up, but pulling out what is essentially Arthas's essence/soul instead to join the fallen. Almost like a metaphor for Arthas being among those who fell in Northrend. So while it's not a scene of redemption, it's like Jukai said, it's about forgiveness.</div></div><hr />

Protection DPS<br />
We'll buff sustained damage in the same patch where we nerf Warbringer and the block conversion to Shield Slam. It probably won't end up being a 2000 dps increase for anyone, but it should help close the gap. <br />
<br />
Shield Slam changes<br />
Currently, the SBV you gain from Shield Block (skill) is unaffected by the diminishing returns. I'm asking if this will still be the case. <br />
The diminishing returns are applied pre Shield Block. It's the lesser of the two nerfs you mentioned. We picked a number that would only greatly affect tanks going out of their way to get really big Shield Slam crits, which is typically not the guy tanking Icecrown bosses.

Oh ffs... Nerf the frickin' ArP contribution to shield slam! Nerf the stacking of shield block, improved disarm, recklessness, and ArP!<br />

Theys tells us to stack some threat stats. Then theys nerfs the said threat stats. Effin' pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It resembles Lament of the Highborne only in that both have choirs :P It's essentially the 'complete' version of the music from the background of the WotLK trailer. I believe the 'language' being sung in in the music is supposed to be the language or Lordaeron, which resembles Latin. Lament of the Highborne is pretty clear-cut elven, and the music in the Crimson Halls resembles it much more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the catch though: on the official mosaic site, it says that it is an excerpt from Fall of the Lich King, yet I haven't found it while digging through the music files. The Lich King's coronation theme is in there, so could we possibly be listening to the score for the ending cinematic? I'd bet we are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have been far far more impressed with something along the lines of the piece played in the intro scene where arthas is on the cliff and plunges his sword into the ground, that music is haunting and fits the whole mood of the current theme perfectly, not some up beat chippy piece.<br />

<br />
The song is an ode to Invincible. It is a piece of music crafted to celebrate Arthas' beloved horse. It's not a dirge, written to lament over the fact he died, it's an ode, a celebration of Invincible's life. Of course it's going to be more up beat.<br />
<br />
Either that, or an ode to Arthas himself, not lamenting, but remembering to finer points in his life. <br />

Time and events have left it unclear whether the song refers to the former prince of Lordaeron or his beloved steed.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you remember the WotLK Cinematic Intro Music you can definitely recognize how similar the theme of that music is to the Invicible track.I'd say that the track has more to do with Lordaeron's former prince as you mention it rather than his mount.<br />
<br />
By the way, it seems to me that the track is a mix of WotLK Intro Music and the Lament of the Highborne.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree 100%, personally i think the title invincible is more in reference to arthas and his belief that he is invincible, inevitably he will fall &quot; well arthas will&quot; so im guessing this would be in an upcoming clip surrounding either the unlocking of his wing or an in game scene with his downfall?<br />
<br />
could be wrong, fantastic track though and i look forward to its implementation.</div></div><hr />

Now obviously the picture will represent the races' leaders, which is really cool.

I saw one for sale on the blizzard official site, so it'll most likely be illegal for us to find and download the tracks right? If not, can anyone please direct me to one?<br />

<br />
<br />
Well.. then you must not have very good musical ears :)<br />
<br />
This song is a variation of the Arthas theme, &quot;attached&quot; to Arthas since WC3: The Frozen Throne:<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW02BWFRnkw&amp;translated=1<br />
<br />
Good ears will recognize pieces that belong to the same &quot;arrangements&quot; throughout all the video, but the most obvious is the main chorus that appears at 2min16 in this video.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, the song everybody remembers is the one from the Lich King intro, that uses this main chorus again.<br />
<br />
But then this theme was used again during the DK starting zone Chapel of Light events (song named &quot;Assault on New Avalon&quot;, the whole song is a variation of the Wotlk intro music, very clearly. At 1min14 in the music, you can recognize a short male chorus version of the main female chorus of the wotlk intro)<br />
<br />
Then it comes back again in the Wrath Gate event (recognize final part of the theme from the Wotlk Intro Movie at 3min15 in this video):<br />
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xaua1w_wrath-of-the-lich-king-wrath-gate-c_videogames<br />
<br />
<br />
Then in the trailer cinematic &quot;Fall of the Lich King&quot; released a few weeks ago, you can hear some background chorus at 0min45, when King Menethil starts talking:<br />
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbff0d_world-of-warcraft-fall-of-the-lich_shortfilms<br />
<br />
These are the same as in this &quot;Invincible&quot; music at 0min16:<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDmWXhZHTE4&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=16<br />
<br />
Then at 1min15 it goes with same score as the second part of the Wotlk Intro.<br />
And if you're very focused, you can ear in the very background at 1min.39 in the Fall of the LK trailer, the first line of the main Arthas chorus theme (from FT &amp; WOTLK Intro) distorded in the distant. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been very smart with making the Lich King musical score cohesive, so this is pretty sure this is from the final cinematic, more than an ode to his horse :)</div></div><hr />

Totem of Wrath and Demonic Pact is something we've said before that we want to fix. They should be virtually the same buff (+spell power) and they definitely are not that now. It's a big change though, because currently Elemental shaman don't want to drop Totem of Wrath, unless they think that is the only thing getting them a raid slot, while on the other hand, Demo locks might very well vanish from raiding without their buff. None of this is ideal, but it's also not a trivial fix or we would have done it long ago. Remember it gets even more complicated in the Cataclysm time frame because Intellect (and buffs that provide +Int) also provides spell power. (Source)<br />

ok but why don't you just take away Elemental Oath and give it to demo locks or destructio...then after you could balance Totem of Wrath and Demonic Pact<br />

Warlcok is the only class in game that don't have a unique buff(please i am not talking about health stone) or a Buff more powerfull than any other class if that is change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say healthstone/soulstone are both fairly non-trivial buffs. Soulstones especially. We're just sortof moving in that direction, where each class only brings maybe one, or two things that is unique to them to the raid. Hard to tell if it's bad or good, but.. that's how it is.</div></div><hr />

It's not just from the Wrath intro cinematic music (which is called &quot;Arthas, My Son&quot;).<br />
<br />
It was first used at the end of The Frozen Throne's ending cinematic (&quot;The Ascension&quot;), after Arthas merged with Ner'zhul. TFT ended with the Lich King sitting atop the Frozen Throne, with the camera slowly panning out to show Icecrown Citadel, with a man's voice singing the chant.<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW02BWFRnkw<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthas, My Son&quot; begins with the same chant, but sung by a young boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Invincible&quot; is the first time that the chant has gotten a song all to itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt they`d make such awesome music for a fallen horse lol, and if you listen to the WotLK trailer this song sounds identical to it.<br />
I don't know. Invincible was pretty much the only living thing Arthas ever really cared about, in the end. Its death was the first thing that started to send Arthas towards his current path, and the first thing he did after killing his father was to go to the Balnir Farmstead and raise it. He also went berserk with rage when Anasterian sliced off its legs at the Sunwell.</div></div><hr />

I think blizzard has released a soundtrack with every CE theyve done... I know they did with diablo 2 and I personally own the War 3 and all WoW ones...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So the original song &quot;Arthas, My Son&quot; got some tweaking and became &quot;Invincible&quot; :P<br />
still keeps the epic tones as always<br />
<br />
you can also hear this at the end of Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne Outro<br />

<br />
Actually in that cinematic its the same music but different lyrics... listen closely and you can hear the difference... I also always thought it was interesting that in that cinematic and on the menu of TFT it shows the frozen thrown spire surrounded by water after the mountain around it collapses but in WoW it has a mountain behind it and solid ice in front of it throughout the rest of the zone... so I'm guessing blizz originally had the throne at the northern end of the zone near the ocean instead of on the south end &quot;in the mountains&quot;....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Probably not but possible... I posted the lyrics for the part similar to the wotlk intro on page 7 and I'm sure that the rest of the song uses the same language which is not latin although during the parts of the wotlk into cinematic where sindragosa is actually coming out of the ice there are a couple lines of latin... I know this because the cinematic art book labels them as such in the translation of the full lyrics to the cinematic's song... and actually now that I look at the lyrics more I would say it's probably not a form of elvish but the native language of azerothian humans, but I don't remember what that one's called...</div></div><hr />

You get caught up with gear and dkp and this and that and boss strategies. <br />
<br />
This music however, brings the proper feeling back. It's a fantasy world, and these epic moments are what define it. Can't wait to see what the cinematic is. I expect it will show after killing the lich king. Who knows.</div></div><hr />

The song definitely refers to the horse.<br />

As a great warcraft lore geek, this makes me appreciate the game even more. There is more to this game than getting loot and achievements. Music like this does help to get the fantasy feeling of the game. Though I doubt it is dedicated for Invincible. It sounds sad, reminding me about Arthas when he was a holy paladin only trying to save his kingdom and people, before he was corrupted.<br />
<br />
Soon the Lich King will die, and we get to see the climatic ending of this expansion. I am hopeful that the good Arthas will be part of the Lich King fight or in the epilogue after. I hear that a cutscene will come immediately after the Lich King dies.</div></div><hr />

about paths: LM is easy accessible from stables as GM does, its easier and faster to get them from ST than from farm. <br />

My Latin is terrible and based on my slightly less terrible knowledge of Spanish, but I believe that the mount reference may not be far off. At least a couple times, including early on, I heard what sounded like &quot;equinus&quot; - close to the Latin root for horse (and where we get words in English like &quot;equestrian&quot; and &quot;equine,&quot; meaning &quot;of or related to horses&quot;).<br />
<br />
Then again, it could just be a passing reference in the song to a broader picture that includes horses. Either way, it's a pretty epic song.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Pretty obvious I'm a TLDR guy, as at least two others have mentioned the Latin reference with much more precision than I did. At least I'm happy I was on the right track. Hope there's a cinematic associated with this ;)</div></div><hr />

It doesn't say what language that is in the book but I would guess its one of the elvish languages from the Warcraft universe...<br />

<br />
Interestng. In my oppinion, the song and these verses have alot more to do with Bolvar than Arthas. It doesn't sound like a sad song to me, more like something very solemn. Throughout the song, I imagined Bolvar putting on the Helm and standing on the throne. Or better yet, Tirion or some random good guy crowning him, with all the spirits of Frostmourne surrounding them</div></div><hr />

Some of it, surely. A lot of the chorus is made up, but the words definitely resemble real words from Latin, Greek, etc.<br />
<br />
For example, thanagor is similar to thane, which is a lord of sorts.<br />
