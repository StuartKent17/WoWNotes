The Faction Champions encounter in the normal 10-player and normal 25-player Trial of the Crusader instances have had a number of spells and abilities altered which should result in less overall damage.<br />
The Anub'arak encounter has been changed on all difficulties. Anub’arak now attacks faster, the Nerubian Burrowers should hit a little harder, and their Expose Weakness ability now caps at 9 stacks. (MMO-Champion Note : Apparently the spell now increases damage taken by 25%, down from 30% - Expose Weakness (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/67721/))<br />
Some season 7 arena weapons will now have a socket.<br />
Threat of Thassarian will now properly halve the damage of Rune Strike for the off-hand strike.<br />
Soulstone Resurrection now fades upon entering raid combat if the character who cast it is not present.<br />
The Idle/Inactive debuff is now cleared upon round switches in Strand of the Ancients.<br />
The Mistress of Pain will now target more accurately in the 25 man Heroic Jaraxxus encounter.<br />
The damage of Hunter’s Volley ability has been increased.</div></div><hr />

They nerfed it because some Combos of the champions just made it impossible if you did not have good a PVP group</div></div><hr />

W'll see if a Blocktank now can tank all 4 adds after the buff :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donuts</div><div class="date">2009-09-22, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those Anub'arak changes seem to even out actually. Yes it SEEMS like a buff, but think of it this way:<br />
- Limit the stacks from Burrowers to 9...can be a big help, especially if you're having issues when going from phase 2 to 3.<br />
- MMOC notes that the damage increase has been nerfed on their debuff, another help.<br />
<br />
To make up for it, the physical damage they do was increased. Now the damage is more predictable and less spikey.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dry</div><div class="date">2009-09-22, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anub might also do a little less damage with each attack, which would solve the huge spikes you get on a badly timed Freezing Slash without reducing overall damage dealt, can't be sure though.<br />
<br />
The add debuff will cap at 225% instead of 300% if the MMO note is true, so overall they will probably not deal more damage than before, but simply negating all their damage through block should be much less viable.<br />
<br />
IMO this falls into the &quot;change&quot; category rather than &quot;buff&quot;, difficulty should be the same but encouraging more well balanced raids and strategies. Sucks for those using a block tank for all 4 adds.</div></div><hr />

Go to hell. I mean, seriously, I don't give a shit about paragon or whatever, but man, you and I are enver going to be as good as they are, no matter what they use to beat the encounters.<br />
<br />
My guild and I are slowly getting past Faction champions on heroique, but i'm not sure i'm going to see a tribute chest before IC. So, really, kill yourself before saying nonsense, these guilds still have a very good overall skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good pvp group? What is a good pvp group? All you need to down faction champions is good use of skills and awareness. Nothing extraordinary.<br />
<br />
Saying Faction Champions are impossible is a bit too much. They are one of the easiest bosses in TOC.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, my guild stalled badly in TotC this week on the faction champions purely because of their lineup, wiped just under 30 times over 2 days, with all sort of class swaps and tactics. In perfectly good gear for the fight, with solid experience both in raids and PvE. We don’t mind wiping, infact I personally kind of enjoy it to an extent as it adds to the accomplishment when it is finally achieved. But no matter what we tried, there was just no luck. Our best attempt was able to down one of the arena bosses, and here’s why:<br />
Warrior, Shadow Priest, Resto Shammy, Druid Healer, Warlock and Paladin<br />
<br />
The main issue with this combo were between the druid healer, warrior and lock. The druid heals 50K damage every tick, almost entirely in HoTs, so a single global cool down out of CC and its instant casts heal up everything back to full health over ~10-15 seconds, even if you then get it back into CC again. It doesn’t matter if you have 6 dps all pushing 7K, because her 50K healing alone will outpace your 42K dps (6 x 7K). The warrior needs to be kept busy and away from as many people as possible and the Locks hellfire + pet is just a nightmare. <br />
<br />
I welcome the changes to the faction champions, although I sort of feel that just having the ability to skip them onto the next boss would have been equally good. People saying the faction champions are easy haven’t experienced a bad combo in my opinion. I’m sure now a million people will post back and tell me how they downed the above grouping, I’m open to suggestions but I still think the faction champions had too much flexibility to be the easiest encounter or the hardest.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly a new tactic, and it wasn't only Paragon doing it.<br />

When Ensidia does it, it's &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;. When any other guild does it, it's &quot;exploit&quot;. Seriously, wtf?</div></div><hr />

Purge hots. And First - kill DD, CC Healers. When DD is dead - kill Healers :)<br />
<br />
Champions very easy, even in heroic mode (im talking for our guild only of course).<br />

In perfectly good gear for the fight, with solid experience both in raids and PvE. We don’t mind wiping, infact I personally kind of enjoy it to an extent as it adds to the accomplishment when it is finally achieved. But no matter what we tried, there was just no luck. Our best attempt was able to down one of the arena bosses, and here’s why:<br />
Warrior, Shadow Priest, Resto Shammy, Druid Healer, Warlock and Paladin<br />
<br />
The main issue with this combo were between the druid healer, warrior and lock. The druid heals 50K damage every tick, almost entirely in HoTs, so a single global cool down out of CC and its instant casts heal up everything back to full health over ~10-15 seconds, even if you then get it back into CC again. It doesn’t matter if you have 6 dps all pushing 7K, because her 50K healing alone will outpace your 42K dps (6 x 7K). The warrior needs to be kept busy and away from as many people as possible and the Locks hellfire + pet is just a nightmare. <br />
<br />
I welcome the changes to the faction champions, although I sort of feel that just having the ability to skip them onto the next boss would have been equally good. People saying the faction champions are easy haven’t experienced a bad combo in my opinion. I’m sure now a million people will post back and tell me how they downed the above grouping, I’m open to suggestions but I still think the faction champions had too much flexibility to be the easiest encounter or the hardest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
QFMT<br />
<br />
We run 2 groups in parallel in ToC 10 and the first group got very lucky on their first try on the faction champs and got a combo with only 1 healer.<br />
<br />
The group I was in got the exact same line up you mentioned and no matter what we tried nothing worked. Now, the funny thing is that group 1 laughed and teased us on vent and said that the champs were soooooo easy. This week they got the same line up as you described and lo and behold the chirpy comments on vent were all gone as they had a major wipe fest this time.<br />
<br />
At the same time we countered warrior, rogue, disc priest, ret pala and the resto shammy. This line up was nearly as hard as the last one but after 2 hours and numerous wipes where we tried everything, we finally got them down just because a dead player was micro managing the cc with nazi precision. He could only do that because he was dead and could watch it from a bird’s eye perspective. All the time the ppl in our group were saying &quot;if only we had brought a priest&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm all for challenging encounters but this one needed some tuning and I very much doubt they will be a push over for it.<br />
<br />
This encounter can be very easy or ridiculously hard depending on the combo you get. The rest of the bosses are just lulz in comparison in my opinion. I guess they wanted the encounter to be a bit more consistent.<br />
Although I think we got the right strategy down the last successful attempt, I wasn’t looking forward to that combo again for this week. <br />
<br />
Maybe now I will.</div></div><hr />

These are the obvious ideas we attempted immediately, but sadly it just doesn’t work on the druid healer/lock/warrior/shadow priest/pally/resto shammy combo. If you look back at what I said, the issue is mainly the druid healer. You can’t just CC the druid, because when it comes out of CC, even if it goes straight back in, virtually all its heals are instant cast HoTs that deal 50K healer per tick. So that single GCD out of CC is enough to heal her whole team back to full health. When we fought this combo, every time we would nuke the druid down to about 20% before CC started to fail big time. Looking at the stats, we were doing about 1 mil damage to the druid, so in principle had killed her twice, but she heals so powerfully you just can’t dps through it even with 7K damage.<br />
<br />
If it were normal boss mechanics you would just chain CC the druid like you suggested, but because this uses the PvP mechanic diminishing returns and trinket type abilities prevent you from keeping a mob trapped indefinitely, and as I’ve said about 3 times, if she comes out of CC even for a second that’s all it takes to wipe.<br />
<br />
I feel a lot better for seeing other people posting about this particular combo being very difficult, and I wonder whether it’s possible tbh. I suspect if you maybe got lucky and could kill the druid you might just be able to recover and win, but like I say, we tried about 30 times with basically no progress whatever we tried. Our best attempt did kill the druid, but by that time we’d lost about 7 players.</div></div><hr />

When Ensidia does it, it's &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;. When any other guild does it, it's &quot;exploit&quot;. Seriously, wtf?<br />
<br />
<br />
In case you missed it, A LOT of people called what ensidia have done for exploits where others have said otherwise.<br />
<br />
Want to take a guess what the situations is with Paragon? In case you can't figure it out, it is EXACTLY the same.<br />
<br />
This whole wrong regarding right or wrong is getting old. The community and Blizzard generally decides what's okay or not. And in cases like Paragon it's obvious that it was OK, since neither Blizzard or the community has &quot;taken&quot; their world first.<br />
<br />
What is interesting however in my book is the method these guilds use, to actually complete these &quot;unbeatable&quot; encounters. SS on raid or adds from Freya Trash wasn't exactly works of a genius, but still interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The druids HoTs take 3 seconds before they can tick once. having someone offensively dispelling the HoTs as soon as they appear on the kill target wont let the druid heal for enough to wipe your raid. If the druid is healing too much to the point it gets back to full, your either not dispelling correctly or your dps sucks which according to you doesn't seem to be the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CC'ing the druid with 1 warlock really is possible. In 3 attempts (2 wipes, 1 succesful), a lock in our guild let the druid get off 2 casts total. And the wipes were not particularly quick either. It definitely isn't easy I know (I was on it the previous week) since you have to be very aware of any danger to yourself as well as keeping the druid within 15 yards, but it is possible.<br />
<br />
Saying that, I still hope the nerf is for Faction Champions heroic too. There is simply too much randomness. If they really want a PvP fight then make it 25 vs 25 (or 10 vs 10) with the same lineup each time, nerf <br />
their stats massively, and make them truly smart (e.g. none of this trinketing the first cc done to them).<br />
<br />

OK, seeing as a few people mention they have an issuue with the above line of faction champs i deccided to post how we ROFLSTOMP this combo with ease twice now.<br />
<br />
Kill order.....Drood healer, Shadow priest,lock, pally, shammy, warrior.<br />
We do this with jst 2 cc, no tanks. <br />
A DK is needed<br />
First the pull, easist way is a pally bubble pull and army of the dead.<br />
A rogue goes on the shammy healer and interuppts whilst the dk grips the warrior and kites him by spamming chains of ice and keep him busy<br />
pop hero and brute force down the drood healer and the priest asap. move onto the lock and DO NOT KILL HIS PET&quot;, if the shammy gets heals off at this point we deiscovered lots are aimed at it and it isnt really a big problem . once the lock is down its plain sailing. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />

-Dispel/purgue everything<br />
-Good CC<br />
-Focus fire<br />

So what about all the legit things... like people (warlocks) DC'ing and the raid continueing... without them? The warlock comes back, part way through the fight.... but hey... you've lost your Soulstone... guess you might as well not have bothered. Does it account for that (unlikely) or are we now going to have to put up with failed mechanics (having to not use SS till the very last possible moment) becuase of a select few people who thought it would be a good idea to have the entire raid SS'd.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's just my own limited perception, but in this limited perception hunters are always the ones who are closest if not topping (mostly due to poison proc issues) rogues in terms of AoE damage.<br />

Maybe our casters are just... not able to spam a button at the right intervals? I don't ever see mages or warlocks in the tops of the meters when it comes to AoEing something.<br />

Wow, you must be seriously leet and clearly all the people struggling on FC 10 man are noobs. Twat. Why don't you can the elitist bullshit. My comm (10 man only) 1 or 2 shotted every Coliseum boss bar the FC. Last raid we wiped 24 times on them before we got them down. We didn't have a Priest for mass dispels and had the FC composition of doom listed above. Previously we've got them down in 3 or 4 wipes, but on 10 man you're completely screwed over by the variability in your own raid comp (25 mans are guaranteed to have a disc Priest for example), and sub-optimal FC comps. And I won't even get started on the retarded idea of getting PVE players who never PVP to suddenly have to adapt to a PVP playstyle that they might utterly hate...<br />
<br />
My guild are the first to complain when encounters are nerfed because we like a challenge, but FC is just too variable as a raid encounter in 10 mans- none of us are going to complain at this nerf..</div></div><hr />

It helps greatly to put a rogue or a warrior on the healers for interrupting. its easy to think this fight is all about CC but that simply isn't true. CC barely works at all. Simply tank two of the meleers, and assign interrupts to the healers. Thats much easier then a complicated CC rotation. Now your CC is free to use their abilities defensively, which means they'll stay up much easier. <br />
<br />
The fight isn't hard, its just different, which intimidates some folks.</div></div><hr />

Considering we down this one shot every single week with no issue from their melee dps and people are complaining in this thread about melee dps raping people, I felt the advice appropriate. If you don't have a dk, then yea figure something else out. But one dk tank can keep 2 melee dps on him the entire fight through chains of ice, taunt and death grip.</div></div><hr />

They had a rogue or two spamming talented FoK all the fight for easy mass interrupts. FoK spamming also slows every NPC in range making it very easy to stay away from the melee npc's.<br />
<br />
We didn’t have a single rogue on our attempts with explains some of the difficulty for us.<br />
<br />
It also explains why this encounter was nerfed along with the nerf on the interrupt effect on FoK in 3.2.2.<br />
Bring the player not the class, remember? It also follows a pattern of nerfs that BLizz does to talents that trivialize an encounter. <br />
It all makes a lot more sense to me now and I look forward to this week’s ToC 10 and 25.</div></div><hr />

Was NOT able to banish/fear lock down the Druid healer last time I attempted to do this. The Diminishing returns made it immune to both banish and fear in the end. If someone has any insight in what I might have done wrong, please tell me, cause all I did was Banish -&gt; Fear -&gt; banish -&gt; fear and never overlapping them but waiting till they ran out.<br />
<br />
Nice fixes all in all though =)<br />
<br />
<br />
It should go: Banish, banish, banish, fear, fear, fear, Spell Lock (Fel Hunter pet), Shadowfury, then back to banish as it will be off DR.<br />
<br />
If you are a Blood Elf you can also throw in an Arcane Torrent silence though it shouldn't be necessary. Be sure to have Spell lock macro'd and your pet on passive to make sure it doesn't cast Spell Lock whenever it feels like it. Keep Death Coil for saving your own ass if needed (probably will be) and have a handy teleport up for the same idea, and just use the daze effect of conflagrate to slow down any mobs aggro'd to you. If your raid have 1 or 2 people looking out for Tremor totems this should work.<br />
<br />
This most likely won't 100% lock down the druid but it should come close :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helped!</div></div><hr />
