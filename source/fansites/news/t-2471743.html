Well, he act, he questions her actions, etc. He just doesnt do mak'gora. Which is propably smart because Sylvanas would laught it off/kill him outright with forsaken spawns/cheat.<br />

Since WoD (maybe even before, Cata?) It's becoming more and more apparent that Blizzard isnt just bad at writing &quot;hopelessly complicated&quot; Horde facets that should make them the misunderstood savage races that make up the Horde, but they just don't even wanna try. And Baine just giving up their assets as opposed to building him to a foil to Nathanos and bring the Forsaken a more grounded leadership when Sylvanas finally kicks it. This is on top of literally any and all advantages Blizzard gave them right off the boat. A solid naval military? Not anymore, raised into oblivion. How about that destructive water wand? Nah, Alliance gets to keep that as it belong to them. Oh, and they got the pleasure of killing your racial leader before he allied himself to the cause.<br />
<br />
Bit hey, we got knaifu coming right? Wait, it could just be the right plot device to turn Sylvanas into a Horde enemy too, so Horde may not even get that benefit down the road.<br />
<br />
Even with their horrible writing talent, it comes off obviously avoidant to plaster the whole ensemble that is the Horde as a bunch of mustachioed mice placating Dick Dastardly levels of villainy. That or a tool for the self-righteous Alliance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is a leader of a bunch of massive cows which have more in common in temperament with domestic cows than with minotaurs. So he try to find peaceful solution. Also, those massive cows were nearly wiped out by centaurs. I dont know how long taurens live but it was 13y? since that. A one generation?<br />
<br />
Not much he can do, if they assault outright, even if taurens were minotaurs they would be killed, and problem with every undead army is that every loss for the oponents is one extra soldiers for them. Which Sylvanas has no problem doing.</div></div><hr />

Because hes an idiot. Sylvanas does something terrible in a war, as the leader of a militant faction who is trying to establish security of its boarders through any means. <br />
<br />
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN WAR. <br />
<br />
They have been fighting the humans and dying has been happening on both sides constantly. So because a lot of it happen at once, its suddenly not war ? <br />
<br />
Baine and Cairne knew what they were getting into when they joined the horde. The Alliance is just as cruel at times, especially to Non-human like races. <br />
<br />
Baine, how bout you explain to me how you humanely use that tree on your back to smash peoples faces in? <br />
<br />
I'm not saying Sylvanas is a saint. I'm saying her actions are fitting for a leader trying to destroy her enemies so her people will survive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claymore</div><div class="date">2019-03-12, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll say this much:<br />
<br />
Blizzard's animation department is getting *really* good at these cinematics. And while I don't necessarily like the broader &quot;character&quot; of Baine, I do quite like the voice-actor they've chosen.<br />
<br />
I suspect Derek is some kind of sleeper agent, already corrupted by Sylvanas and will wind up being &quot;triggered&quot; to attack Jaina, at which point her mother will 'take the bullet' for her. Just how I envision this is going to go.<br />
<br />
As far as Baine's fate... not quite sure. Part of me kind of hope he dies, just so a more no-nonsense Tauren can take his place (but NOT Magatha; she's irredeemable in my book). On the other hand, I could also seem something occurring like Sylvanas deciding the best way to punish Baine -- who is clearly ready to give his own life -- is to murder his friends and/or family in front of him. Something to really make him &quot;snap&quot;, and become the mighty warrior that the Tauren so desperately need to represent them. Maybe even have him harness the power of his ancestors, &quot;powering up&quot; a bit as a proper Chieftain? (could also be a good reason to give him a visual upgrade; something about him being so pale looks funny to me)<br />
<br />
Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />

Except Anduin had no intention of going after the Horde until they attacked Darkshore and Teldrassil. What danger was she in, exactly? Her actions cost her hundreds of Horde lives, plus an entire capital city and territory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm so tired of Sylvanas support, or anti-Baine. The dude is doing what's right. None of these people asked to be raised as an undead to feed Sylvanas' army.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just so it's clear, I feel like between the current trajectory of Sylvanas, Saurfang, and Baine; Blizzard is setting up a situation where the factions are super closely aligned to a point where the factions lines are completely blurred. Giving way to a single faction as we continue to progress through the story, with PvP being considered wargames, or PvP being outlaws of the faction. <br />
<br />
I for one welcome our new single global order.</div></div><hr />

He is only in the Horde because he is honor bound to a promise his father made, and over the years he had more and more reason to just leave it.<br />

Just for my PoV: Baine constantly complains about the Horde, repeatedly goes to Jaina/Anduin with his tail between his legs begging for something or other, undermines the Horde's plans and repeatedly says he doesn't want to be part of the Horde then... does nothing, just sits back and watches the Tauren smash themselves in battle fighting for something he hates. Shit or get off the pot Baine! Leave or get on board.<br />

It's indeed lame, I don't think Baine should rely on alliance and this good vs evil is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
But I kinda understand him, I stopped playing Horde in MoP because I was feed up with the Horde storyline with Garrosh, it became a different faction from the one I joined in vanilla, but he don't get to simply quit, right? :D<br />

I take what I'm given. It's minor but at least he did -something-. And more importantly; he did something that fits his character.<br />

Also, very curious when did all those horde fanbois actually start playing horde. Since Baine has much more in common with the old horde than Sylvanas, or any other character, really.

It's becoming more and more apparent that Blizzard isnt just bad at writing &quot;hopelessly complicated&quot; Horde facets that should make them the misunderstood savage races that make up the Horde, but they just don't even wanna try. And Baine just giving up their assets as opposed to building him to a foil to Nathanos and bring the Forsaken a more grounded leadership when Sylvanas finally kicks it. This is on top of literally any and all advantages Blizzard gave them right off the boat. A solid naval military? Not anymore, raised into oblivion. How about that destructive water wand? Nah, Alliance gets to keep that as it belong to them. Oh, and they got the pleasure of killing your racial leader before he allied himself to the cause.<br />
<br />
Bit hey, we got knaifu coming right? Wait, it could just be the right plot device to turn Sylvanas into a Horde enemy too, so Horde may not even get that benefit down the road.<br />
<br />
Even with their horrible writing talent, it comes off obviously avoidant to plaster the whole ensemble that is the Horde as a bunch of mustachioed mice placating Dick Dastardly levels of villainy. That or a tool for the self-righteous Alliance.<br />

this is another revolution xpack since day 1 and they need to build up a role for the alliance and a way to let part of the horde escape punishment, baine is what vol'jin was and derek serve the role of sothing jaina anger.

Cannot wait for the Garrosh styled &quot;Dasardly Horde&quot; story to be written again. With Ion placating it as &quot;The Horde didn't learn from Sylvanas.&quot;<br />
<br />
You'd think, the playerbase is WELL AWARE of the story and hoped it wouldn't be this again. Told that it was't, then became it. It's hard to say Blizzard is that bad to literally avoid giving a complicated situation to the Horde to give it humanity.

That is what is so weird.. Baine is trying to be all buddy buddy with jaina right after she killed Rastakhan and invaded the Zandalari's capital and killed countless civilians?

Or i don't know this was the last straw. After Sylvanas first burn a tree full of innocent people just to spite someone, second kills and resserects her own soldiers because her azerite surprise failef. So third resserecting a long dead soldier who is related to the person who just stomped on your ego, just to be twisted into a weapon that has no free will is a step to far for baine. <br />
But you sylvanas normally gloss over that. Because baine is not a gravelly edge lady in skin thight leather and has large tits. Yea diffently not that.</div></div><hr />

Baine is trying to be all buddy buddy with jaina right after she killed Rastakhan and invaded the Zandalari's capital and killed countless civilians? Can he at least pretend to care about the Horde at all? He is ALWAYS prioritizing the alliance's feewings over the Horde.<br />
<br />
in that case i don't concur that is what the horde is to begin with, the leaders of the horde always give priority to their race when making choices there is not unity like the alliance that all praise and bow to the high king. <br />
Sylvanas is acting as using the horde for her sake, Baine is acting as preserving the tauren way, Galliwix is in for the money, the horde has always been a sort of military pact if we have to translate it in real life the horde is like the Nato while the alliance is like the USA.<br />
Also what baine did introduce a totally new concept for the undead, first look at derek he is undead but have you seen how similar to nathanos he look? a possible leader for alliance necromancer faction? Undead sub race for alliance?<br />
Also how Jaina gonna get it's undead brother accepted among the alliance that has always been 100% against undead? Would she get into a fight with Gen over her brother?</div></div><hr />

It used to be one thing when Horde just got treated like shit, but Blizzard's new strategy is to just turn Horde character's into Alliance pawns and we can't do anything about it. Can't kill them, just gotta sit here and wait for the shitty plot to be over. :/</div></div><hr />

you do realize that this &quot;ITS WAR&quot; excuse is god damn terrible when its SYLVANAS HERSELF that started it in the first place.<br />

It's like everyone forgets the whole of the Alliance Side of Stormheim's Story is attacking the Horde and trying to hunt and kill Sylvanas before we knew she was planning evil stuff with Helya because Genn believes they betrayed them by sounding a retreat at the Broken Shore and getting Anduin to agree with this plan. Not forgetting Genn hates her anyway cause of everything.<br />

Sky Admiral Rogers says: Stormheim is home to one of the Pillars of Creation - the [Aegis of Aggramar].<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: Vrykul legends speak of a trial - to conquer this trial is prove one's worth and lay claim to the Aegis.<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: Impressive, aren't they? The new guns could bag a wyvern at full speed from three hundred meters. Go ahead, have a look.<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: Our official orders are to escort you to Stormheim and ensure your success on this trial.<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: Unofficially, however, we have another mission...<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: The 7th Legion. The toughest men and women the Alliance have to offer. They, too, have come on direct orders from the king.<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: Three days ago, the Forsaken fleet set sail from Durotar, heading straight for the Broken Isles. We think Sylvanas Windrunner herself may be among them.<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: We are to track them from a safe distance. We may engage, but only if the situation demands.<br />
Sky Admiral Rogers says: I strongly suspect the situation will demand it.<br />
Genn Greymane says: It had better.<br />
Genn Greymane says: I am not in the habit of tracking prey unless I intend on killing it.<br />

Also don't forget before they changed it, the Alliance attacked Gallywix's miners in Silithius first before the SI:7 agents were found as an act of sabotage and were tasked with gathering Azerite in an attempt to figure out how to use it against the Horde and potentially Orgrimmar. They had to make the Alliance appear less nefarious so they changed it to the agents being discovered first and needing to defend themselves whilst stopping the miners to keep the Azerite out of the Horde's hands and collecting some for themselves so they could figure out what it was and how to fight back against it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It feels like they wrote themselves into a corner. They have to get rid of Sylvanas now, because they've wrote her too far gone - But all her alternatives are bad, and now they have to make one that people aren't going to be collectively pissed about, and Baine ain't it.<br />
<br />
It's about time they started telling a story that makes sense, but it's a little late in BFA to finally figure out you've been doing everything wrong the entire time. By this point the expansion is half over. By the time it finally wraps up, the best people can hope for is &quot;Meh. That was ok.&quot;</div></div><hr />

She is worse than Garrosh. Garrosh was correct in trying to stop her. She needs to die by the hands of Saurfang so he can be our new warchief. Either that or bring back Vol because it was BS that he was only Warchief for a brief period.<br />

FYI, Sylvanas sent the Tauren to Silithus to assist the Earthern Ring before she set out for Teldrassil. She purposely sent them away because she knew Baine would not go along with her plans. That's why there are no Tauren there and why Baine couldn't have stopped it.</div></div><hr />

As per Before the Storm the Alliance isn't 100% against undead, only against those who want to end all life. So against sylvanas and her scourge. And in that same book Genn also admits sylvanas is not the entire forsaken and they are people just like any other and he was too judgmental. There shouldn't be any major problems really. Family is family. And while Jaina didn't understand that as a child she definitely does now.</div></div><hr />

Why specifically for Derek? Why is this the &quot;too far&quot; mark?<br />
<br />
By the time the burning of Teldrassil happens, Baine is already on very thin ice with Sylvanas. Unlike his father, Baine doesn't have strong ties with any of the Horde leadership and is more isolationist than the Tauren have been in the past. The Tauren have always been more moderate than the rest of the horde, preferring peace and harmony over conflict but they have waged war with the Horde out of loyalty and because they believed the horde to be honourable. When the horde lost its honor under Garrosh, his father stood up against the warchief and paid for it with his life. Before Darkshore, Baine stood up to Sylvanas after the massacre at Arathi highlands and she threatened his life and the lives of his people. He knows that she will follow through with her threats as she is without honour. <br />
<br />
The Derek Proudmore situation is the straw that breaks the camel's back. He was pissed at what happened at Darkshore (burning) and Undercity (blight) but had to protect himself and his people. He had no control over those events as he didn't have prior knowledge but with Derek, he knows what Sylvanas is planning and that it is immoral. He can do something about it and standing by would be wrong, in his eyes. <br />
<br />
Personally, I like that the horde are having to question what it means to be 'The Horde' and that characters like Baine and Saurfang have concluded that in order to protect what they believe 'The Horde' means, they have to betray the Warchief. It makes the faction more interesting and less black and white, clear cut.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's just bad writing and Blizzard using the Horde leadership to build up boring Alliance characters using &quot;muh honour&quot; quotes. It's as if Baine forgot that Jaina invaded Zuldazar moments before his meetup, killed his comrades defending Zuldazar, and then murdered the Zandalari king. It would be okay if he was just forgetful, but he wants to make peace by bringing Derek to Jaina... Because he's worried about Jaina's fweeling? Why doesn't he just take Derek to his allies? It's almost as if he doesn't believe in the Horde anymore. Saurfang and Baine are nothing but Alliance puppets right now, and it's sad because Saurfang was a fantastic character before his shitty forced honour speeches in BFA. What does honour even mean at this point? <br />
<br />
And before you tell me about the &quot;old Horde before Sylvanas,&quot; please remember that honour meant different things to different people over the course of the Horde history. Garrosh Hellscream put strength on a higher pedestal. He wanted glory for the Orcs, which also happens to mean honour. Other races of the Horde don't value &quot;honour&quot; like Thrall either. Certainly not the Blood Elves nor the Nightborne, nor the Goblins, and definitely not the Forsaken. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for why the Taurens joined the Horde. The reason goes back to Warcraft III. Cairne Bloodhoof and his Taurens were nearly driven to extinction by the centaurs. The Orcs save them from the centaurs. The savagery and nobility displayed by the Orcs actually intrigued Cairne. Then his son, Baine, gets captured by the centaurs. The Night Elves watch and laugh while Cairne sits at home depressed. Rexxar and Rokhan come asking for help against Admiral Proudmoore (Jaina's daddy), but Cairne tells them to fuck off. Rexxar and Rokhan then rescue Baine and return him to Cairne. To show his gratitude, Cairne swears a blood oath to serve the Horde for saving his people. That's basically it. Oh and together with the Orcs, he kills Jaina's father and drives back the Kul'Tiran invasion :). <br />
<br />
Taurens value peace and tranquility, but honor has always meant loyalty to the Taurens. Let me remind you, it was the Baine who convinced Thrall to let Sylvanas and her Forsaken into the Horde. All of these races are in an alliance of convenience. <br />
<br />
If Baine actually cared about the Horde, he would have went to Lor'themar or Thalyssra or Mayla Highmountainor or Talanji. Instead he ran to the very person who slaughtered his comrades and civilians of the Horde just moments before the meeting.<br />
<br />
The Horde is a group of outcasts that banded together to survive. <br />
<br />
The Horde has always been a combination of values and goals. Honour itself has several meanings; glory, respect, nobility, esteem and even prestige. Sylvanas' Horde isn't hated by every single member of the Horde. In fact, Overlord Geya'rah of the Mag'har Orcs actually admires Sylvanas.</div></div><hr />

His actions make sense to me so the writing is good for some people. Just because the Alliance attacked Zandalar, it doesn't make what Sylvanas was doing right in Baine's view. He is not protecting Jaina's 'feelings'. He protecting the honour of the horde by not allowing Sylvanas to follow through with her plan. Giving Derek to other horde leaders makes no sense since they are not standing against Sylvanas.</div></div><hr />

Attacking a City and Killing the King = war. Burning a City after a Victory and Killing civillians that way = war crime. (IMO). Jaina wouldnt have let him escape If the fire wasnt severe enough.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance attacked Dazar'alor, killing everything ijn their path to the king. Likely mowed down plenty of civilians along the way because there was no warning before the attack. Sylvanas burned Teldrassil after messing around on Darkshore, allowing the Nelves plenty of time to evacuate civilians. Yeah some civilians were killed but it wasn't an act of genocide so therefore not a war crime. What the Alliance did was much more of a war crime than what Sylvanas did.</div></div><hr />

In the alliance version you are told to only engage soldiers. And keep civilian casualties to a minimum. So sayping the alliance went on a killing spree is bull fecal matter. Also rastakhan was given the option to surrender, we have standards. I can't say the same about some horde members.</div></div><hr />

Jaina was also ordered not to kill the king. So it's pretty clear orders were NOT followed by the actual invading force. You really think Jaina and the host of Kul Tiran soldiers wouldn't go on a rampage and murder anyone that came into view as an act of revenge for what the Horde did at Theramore and Stormsong Valley? lmao</div></div><hr />

Jaina isn't even at the rastakhan fight she spends her time delaying the horde so the alliance can even get to him. as for the soldiers i won't say that their aren't some straglers that did but would have been away from the main force and would have likely died because of it. because mutch to my surgrin the alliance does has standards</div></div><hr />

<br />
or she just got there. in the actual fight the only alliance npc's that are there are gen greymane and mathias shaw. and this is true in both in the alliance version and horde version. so saying she is the one that killed him is highly debatable</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Chekov's Rifle/Gun&quot; is a label concerning the fact that a story never uses something even though the story has given the expectation (by merely presenting the thing) that it should be used.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that's what you were trying to get it, that you think Jaina's brother is something that is going to be used simply because he's there, but it didn't seem to me as if you got the term right based on what you said.</div></div><hr />

I think he was talking about the shot of Derick Proudmoore with a dagger strapped to his back that the camera sat on for like 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />

If you dont see the difference here, we wont ever agree.</div></div><hr />

There is a difference. Sylvanas lit up the tree after several hours of intense battle on Darkshore, allowing people to time to evacuate Teldrassil. The Alliance struck with absolutely no warning after diverting all military forces to Nazmir. The Zandalari had no chance to evacuate anyone. The Alliance just started fucking the place up before murdering the King.</div></div><hr />

Also, very curious when did all those horde fanbois actually start playing horde. Since Baine has much more in common with the old horde than Sylvanas, or any other character, really. Sure, he has nothing in common with the post-Thrall horde, yes, but that horde is trash, and should be destroyed.<br />
<br />
Yes, this! The whole premise behind classic WoW was the trope inversion: the Horde was a noble, diverse, and inclusive group whose primary focus was honor and welcoming the downtrodden and homeless; while the Alliance was corrupt, racist trash literally controlled by the black dragonflight! It's pretty explicit in pre-Cata WoW that the Horde is the good guys and the Alliance is the bad guys, and that subversion of expectations is one of the things that made it so interesting.<br />
<br />
Basically, I want Thrall back. I guess Baine or Saurfang would do in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Tangentially related: it kinda looked to me like they're really setting up Talanji as the new leader of the Horde, but that seems like it would be a hard sell to the guys back in Kalimdor…</div></div><hr />
