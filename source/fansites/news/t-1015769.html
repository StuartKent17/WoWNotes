It doesn't actually mean much, it just means that we reached the point where Blizzard is comfortable enough to release most of the static assets to the live client while they finish polishing the PTR one. There was no release candidate build on the test realms and I don't really see the patch happening right now, you can all calm down.<br />

It needs a lot of work with what is on the PTR. Remember the inhouse build is 2-4 builds ahead of the PTR. So what bugs and issues might be existant now could have already been squashed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2011-11-05, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: How big is the download?<br />
A: 805mb.<br />
<br />
Q: Is this patch available to the EU?<br />
A: Yes.<br />
<br />
Q: I'm getting an &quot;applying non-critical updates&quot; message on the Launcher. What do I do?<br />
A: Nothing. Just wait a few minutes and the message will disappear when it's done. The Launcher then will show text saying &quot;Downloading Update&quot;.<br />
<br />
Q: The tracker bar on the Launcher isn't displaying. Why is that?<br />
A: An exclamation point surrounded by a yellow triangle will appear in the bottom-left corner when there appears to be an issue. Click on that button to bring up the downloader details. There is a dialogue area at the top of the new window where you'll be given an explanation for the ! icon being displayed.<br />
<br />
Q: It says the tracker isn't responding and/or my computer appears to be behind a firewall. Help!<br />
A: I had both of those errors myself, and I wasn't stopped from smoothly downloading all of the data. The only hitch for me was that I wasn't seeding any of the patch data. If your download is proceeding at a reasonable pace, I wouldn't worry much about those issues. If not, check the settings of any anti-virus or firewall software you're using to make sure that World of Warcraft is allowed. As for the tracker, I'm not very knowledgeable in that area. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Q: The download is not auto-starting.<br />
A: Go to your World of Warcraft folder and double-click on the file labeled &quot;BackgroundDownloader.exe&quot; (without the quote marks). Note: You may need to right-click the file and select &quot;Run as Admin&quot; depending on your circumstances.<br />

How do you mean? Are you unable to locate the BackgroundDownloader.exe file, or it won't run...? Usually, all you need to do is just double-click it (or right-click and choose &quot;Run as Admin&quot; if needed) and it should run normally.<br />

I was up-to-date on my copy and I watched the downloader info nearly the entire time (yeah, you can tell I was bored). Final result after it completed was 805mb. So, I have no idea why you wound up with only 200mb...</div></div><hr />

&lt; 6 months for a tier of content with possibly the most difficult pre-nerf boss fight is pretty fast. We sat on LK for so much longer. I don't really understand why the people are complaining. You said you didn't want to raid 4 different versions of the same raid every week (10 N/HM, 25 N/HM), so they squashed it. Then 2 was too many (10/25) and the content was too slow.

<br />
Blizzard's patching servers are geo-located caching CDN servers. Which means they will technically resolve to a different physical host based on where you are in the world.<br />
<br />
So your local Blizzard CDN server probably hasn't had it propagated to it yet.<br />
<br />
If you're wanting to &quot;reset&quot; the manifest lists of what you need to download do this :<br />
<br />
1) Quit all Blizzard programs (Background downloader , launcher , wow etc etc etc)<br />
<br />
2) Using a command prompt flush your DNS cache. This will vary depend on which OS you are on but with windows I think it's ipconfig /flushdns <br />
<br />
This will ensure that if the IP address for the patching server has changed it will give you a new IP address for the patching server.<br />
<br />
3) Go in your wow folder and delete wow.mfil , wow.tfil and the launcher.wtf file in the WTF folder. <br />
<br />
This step will reset the manifest lists , how much of a patch you've downloaded as well as the torrent information it uses to download patches.<br />
<br />
4) Open the Launcher , go into the Downloader Preferences and Turn on &quot;Download while playing World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;Don't thottle background download&quot;<br />
<br />
While you're doing this the Launcher will be contacting the patching server and grabbing relevant information about what to download.<br />
<br />
5) Wait at the launcher until you see &quot;Downloading data for the next patch&quot;<br />
<br />
If you don't see all this don't stress out. It may not of propagated to your part of the world yet and there's not much you can do if that is true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not 15.3 GB.<br />
<br />
Your reading it wrong. It's giving you the total size including the 4.3 pre-patch and also including the patch data you've already downloaded.<br />
<br />
If it say's it's &quot;Downloading 14.6 of 15.2 GB&quot; This means it's already got 14.6 GB of it and only needs to download around 800 MB to bring it up to roughly 15.2 GB<br />
<br />
<br />

I've said that for.. quite a while now. Here's to hoping i dont get flamed again for having &quot;no proof&quot; -_- But yeah, I still say this patch is &quot;supposed&quot; to be blizzards answer to the release of tor, and every holiday release in general, to try and sucker players into playing for a little longer vs switching to tor/other games.</div></div><hr />

It won't, believe me. They only just put in the Darkmoon Faire content on the PTR today, there's also more raid tests to be done... A lot of work to do yet and I don't see Blizzard releasing 4.3 when there's still a lot of guilds struggling on Ragnaros (remember how 4.1 came without Firelands?). My guess is mid-December at the earliest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: didn't say this before, but my realistic guess as to when 4.3 will be out will be January 9</div></div><hr />

Normally not a problem as I just download the file manually, however when trying to update I realize that I don't have the wow.tlif file. From the research I have done that is required to apply the patch through the launcher once downloaded....I can't find a copy online anywhere sadly. Does anyone know a way around this or where I could get a hold of the .tlif file? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
