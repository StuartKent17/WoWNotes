Patch 3.0.8 going live this week<br />
Patch 3.0.8 is going live this week, this isn't official yet but ... oh well, you know how it works. This post will be updated in the next few hours because with all the 3.0.8 undocumented changes I forgot, please point out any error/missing change in comments. <br />
<br />
<br />
Minor Bugs<br />
When the next minor content patch is released players may notice two separate issues. The warlock spell Ritual of Summoning can only be used once every two minutes. Additionally, there are some human female animation errors, specifically when using two-handed weapons or shooting with a ranged weapon. Both of these issues are actively being addressed and we hope to have a fix available shortly after the patch releases. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enchantment reagents changes<br />
A lot of enchantment recipes have been changed and now require less/different reagents. <br />

Btw Boubouille, I saw that you linked to the patch download in IRC but I also noticed that the build number in that link (9438) isn't the same build number that's currently on the PTR (9464). Doesn't this mean that changes since build 9438 on the PTR aren't going to be included in the Live build tomorrow? <br />
<br />
Unless that was just the download for the downloader and there's going to be a second download to the most recent version once the first build is applied...</div></div><hr />

They already have enough problems with live as it is, and I think they are too afraid to push out current PTR patch to live. Don't get your hopes up, at least 2 more weeks if not more.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ptr is not the current build which will be going for release.<br />
<br />
Blizzard feel it would be a waste of resources to update the PTR for every minor bug they have fixed and instead keep them to themselves to roll out for the official server. It shoudlnt really surprise you they didnt give you the most up to date version, because they can still pretty adequately test and get 90% of the bugs fixed from feedback and testing even if other bugs still exist.<br />
<br />
It takes a lot longer if you want the PTR to be perfect before its okay to go to live. Instead they have their &quot;in house&quot; version which will go live instead.<br />
<br />
You can quote me when i say its going to be better then the PTR.<br />
<br />
How much better? Depends how many bugs they fixed which subsequently caused new bugs :)</div></div><hr />

Tardfactor.com - Patch Date Predictions (http://www.tardfactor.com/patches/patch-date-predictions)<br />
<br />
<br />
Those predictions are way, way off. If you've ever been on a major PTR before you'd know that Ulduar will take at the very least 4 months on PTR. Keep in mind that this is also the patch where Blizzard is making significant changes to several classes for PvP, as well as the Dual Spec patch.<br />
<br />
No one in the top raiding guilds are expecting 3.1 before the middle of Summer '09.</div></div><hr />

Looks like the live release will be 9464, which is why I said &quot;don't install the file&quot; when I linked it on IRC and obviously why I didn't post it on the front page. (I'm pretty sure the patch won't work tbh, I later realized it was a bug on my side) <br />

There are a bunch of performance fix in 3.0.8 that can't be hotfixed, they're probably rushing the release to try to get the live version more stable. Btw I'm now 100% sure that the patch will be tomorrow.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's the point. They think you shouldn't have the mitigation for PvP, but that you need it for tanking. With the incoming change you will have it only for tanking, just the way they want it. <br />
<br />
You do keep stun resistance for PvP though and that's pretty big.</div></div><hr />

Gotta go isnt so hard with a decent mellee setup, but i have yet to see any dps casters become even close to doing it. (not including the spell steal hack by mages when it first came out).<br />
<br />
Dot users currently have zero chance to do it imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it's definitely quite doable with casters; I did it as part of an affliction warlock/fire mage/shaman group (feral for tanking and I forget the 5th) and we had it on our 4th or 5th try with plenty of time to spare. Strong dots help the cause by taking a lot of health off while he's underground; after his first submerge he came up at about 45% and we burned him to 3%, and then the dots finished him off while he was underground the second time.<br />
<br />
Also American servers still aren't offering the patch. :-X</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping it's because they're patching the stuff required for the latency fixes right now and the updates to the servers themselves takes a minimum amount of time so they can be held off until the other server fixes are in place.<br />
But none the less, the servers are currently only 'down' not 'offline'.<br />

Patch notes on the 11th December (when 3.0.8 came out on the PTR):<br />
<br />
Seal of the Martyr: now deals 27% of normal weapon damage. (up from 22%)<br />
<br />
Seal of Command: now Gives the Paladin a chance to deal {0.45*Min Weap Damage+0.45*0.23*SpellPower} to {0.45*Max Weap Damage+0.45*0.23*SpellPower} additional Holy damage. (Old - Didn't scale with Spell Power)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah Judgement has (dunno why I said that, must've gotten confused with the new libram effect) but as stated earlier, Seal of Command was changed when the first PTR build of 3.0.8 came out to:<br />
<br />
Seal of Command: now Gives the Paladin a chance to deal {0.45*Min Weap Damage+0.45*0.23*SpellPower} to {0.45*Max Weap Damage+0.45*0.23*SpellPower} additional Holy damage. (Old - Didn't scale with Spell Power)<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering if this is still the case, since it doesn't show on the patch notes.<br />
<br />

There is no lvl80 tanking idol in sight! And yes, I read the blue post that said they were working on it. But this was at the same time they were &quot;working&quot; on the new sigil. Cmon, how hard was it to include a bear idol in the process?! I'm sure we the only class and spec in the game that can't utilize an ilvl200 or ilvl213 in that slot. I mean, I can equip any Feral DPS idol in that slot, but it does me absolutly no good as a bear. :-[<br />

On a side note: I guess I'm still stuck with Mongoose as well! <br />
