It’s been a crazy past few months for all of us on the Hearthstone team. We announced Hearthstone at PAX East back in March, began the Closed Beta Test in August, had a great Hearthstone event at BlizzCon with the Innkeeper’s Invitational along with our announcements for Android and iPhone support, and now we’re ready to unleash the awesomeness of Hearthstone to you with Open Beta!<br />
<br />
So what does this mean for you? If you didn’t get the chance to participate in the Hearthstone Closed Beta Test, now is your chance to download the game! Just click here (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) to download Hearthstone, or you can use the Play Free Now button at the top of playhearthstone.com. We have no plans to perform any more wipes of Hearthstone, so feel free to amass your collection and play against your friends!<br />

What if you don’t play in the North American region? Don’t worry; we plan to go to Open Beta for all of the other regions within the next few days as well, so stay tuned for more information!<br />
<br />
As open beta is still a beta phase, we will be closely monitoring many aspects of the game to ensure a positive play experience for everyone. Please be aware that if smoke starts curling out of our servers due to unexpectedly high demand to play Hearthstone, we may have to temporarily disable open beta account activations for a time until we’re ready to take on more players.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paralleluniverse</div><div class="date">2014-01-21, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avoid this unfair, pay-to-win game. Save your time.<br />
<br />
I've been in the beta since Day 1.<br />
<br />
I'm done with this game and I will not play it again. It's not a fair game.<br />
<br />
Here's why:<br />
<br />
1. It's pay to win. People who spend more money can get more cards, better cards, more options to build better decks, meanwhile people who don't spend money need to grind for days to get even 1 deck of cards, and the pitiful rate of 1 gold per win. Even the MMR system cannot fix this unfairness at the top of the MMR curve, where high MMR players with bought cards have more than 50% win rate (like SC2). A person with 2000 skill rating + $100 spent is better than a person with 2000 skill rating. It's unfair. People should not be allowed to buy cards with real money.<br />
<br />
2. There is no release wipe. It allows people who, by dumb luck, have been in the beta to get an unfair card advantage, for absolutely no reason. Why should beta testers get to keep their account without a wipe, when people who weren't lucky enough to get into the closed beta are systemically and unfairly, of no fault of their owned, denied this advantage of early access? And some of these people are now defending their undeserved entitlement, which they should not get, at the expense of destroying fairness for everyone else.<br />
<br />
3. No ladder and ranking system. No plans for ladder and ranking systems.<br />
<br />
4. No chat. No social features. No plans for chat, no plans for social features.<br />
<br />
5. Flawed reward model that rewards players for tanking their rating and farming noobs by giving these abusers more gold, more quickly.<br />
<br />
6. Per-usage microtransaction of $2 to play Arena. This would be as outrageous as Valve charging $2 to queue All Pick in Dota 2. Or if Microsoft charged $2 to make an Office document with no option of buying Microsoft Office. This is arguably the most greedy business model in existence.<br />
<br />
What would they need to do to make make me play? Never ever sell any cards or packs. Wipe on release. Add ladders and chat. Sell the game for $60 instead. Or sell only cosmetic microtransactions like Dota 2.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, there is no fairness, no equality. Therefore, there is no sense of accomplishment, and hence no point to play. Would anyone bother to compete in the Olympics if drug cheats are allowed? No. So why should I play Hearthstone. The same reasoning applies: if the game is unfair, then accomplishments, like being in Masters, mean nothing because it can be achieved by people using these unfair and undeserved advantages, like buying cards for real money.<br />
<br />
The fact that cards can be grinded at a snail's pace changes nothing, because other people who have spent more money still have the advantage of more cards, better cards, more choices, and a easier ability to adapt to a changing metagame, which isn't possible via grinding. In the long run you can get all the cards... eventually. But in the long run, we are all dead. In the meantime, you're playing a stacked and unfair game. More fundamentally, there is no point to grinding in an unfair game in the first place. So why even bother take the first step? Games like WoW Classic, SC2, WC3, and Dota 2, were built on a model of fairness within the game. Everyone pays the same, everyone gets the same access to the game. If you play the game, then how much money you have outside of the game doesn't affect the game. Your real world finances doesn't come into the game as an advantage. In Hearthstone, how much money you spend in real life determines how many cards you have. It's the opposite of fair games where everyone starts perfectly equal like WoW Classic, SC2, WC3 and Dota 2.<br />
<br />
The unfairness and inequality of Hearthstone cheapens the game for everyone as accomplishments become meaningless, because people who have bought cards can achieve the same, just like drug cheats in the Olympics. And the fact that there's no ladder and ranking system really does make your accomplishment meaningless because no one knows about them, no one knows you exist. You can't even talk. So the game is meaningless and pointless. And I refuse to play a meaningless and pointless game.<br />
<br />
The developers of this game have a pathological aversion to fairness and equality, in favor of more money and a greedy business model. But as proven by the fact that they decided not to wipe on release, it's not just about money. It proves that they believe in unfairness and inequality, fundamentally and as a matter of principle. And it is ultimately for this reason that I will not play this game.</div></div><hr />

Its a collectible card game, of course you have to pay for the cards, thats the core business model of those types of games. The fact you can earn cards at all by playing/grinding instead of spending money is quite the bonus.</div></div><hr />

MMOC, which is actually specifically a WoW fansite, has posted news about games including other Blizzard IPs and other MMOs for a very long time. We have a pretty active Hearthstone forum, so it's safe to say that many of the users here are interested in hearing this announcement. Not everyone will care about 100% of the news 100% of the time; those that don't care about particular bits of information will just have to learn to scroll past it.</div></div><hr />

Party pooper!<br />
<br />
The game is a ton of fun, adding to the fact that it's free. I've been in closed beta since November and haven't spent a dime, but I still can hold my own and occasionally beat decks that are much better than mine in terms of cards. It's not quite pay-to-win, it's more like pay-to-advantage.<br />

<br />
Been in beta also, but I love CCG, and often fantasy CCG. Yet Hearthstone is one of the worst CCG game I've ever played :(. It feels really empty, dull, boring, and void of content.<br />
<br />
From something out of Warcraft universe, I'd expected a lot from it, when some flash CCG includes content such as hundreds of solo missions, raids, guilds, gvg, faction reputations, guild fighting over territories, achievements with card rewards (ALL of these are in Tyrant for example), I thought Blizzard would take ideas from these and make a wonderful game in the Warcraft universe. But no, there's just... nothing in there, just most basic pvp you can think about, an incredibly expensive arena, and a single player mode so dull you'll drop it and forget about it after the tutorial.<br />
<br />
Not to mention how incredibly slow it is, don't understand how their UX team let all these pointless long animations make it so far in beta (and most likely to release). Also wondering how their (&quot;equal strength&quot;, haha) opponent matching system works, I've seen so many legendary / rare cards while I was just trying to unlock the first basic cards of some characters with their incomplete standard deck...<br />
<br />
Only good points I've seen to it were the Warcraft universe and the graphics. Spent like 4-5 hours on it, don't think I'll get back to it (also having serious concerns about balance).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The game is a ton of fun, adding to the fact that it's free. I've been in closed beta since November and haven't spent a dime, but I still can hold my own and occasionally beat decks that are much better than mine in terms of cards. It's not quite pay-to-win, it's more like pay-to-advantage.<br />
<br />
Which is actually what pay to win is. Out of two players with same strength spending the same amount of time in the game, the paying one will win (unless very unlucky). p2w don't make you suddenly invincible, they just make you way stronger. Yes, under specific circumstances or with bad luck, you'll be killed by non paying player, that doesn't make it not p2w.</div></div><hr />

Newb advice: Watch a TON of streams, you can get better literally over night this way. Second, don't underestimate the value of card advantage. Each card played should be for a reason, and not to just blow your load - board clears are far too easy. YAY more players!</div></div><hr />

All i see in that quote you posted is whining. And it seems it's not his/yours kind of game, if you think about it you would know the idea of having to chat with other people who you're competing against(people you don't know) there's a lot of times you will see a lot of whining and bitching about how good that player is and how much you suck at it(this is an example) that would ruin the fun for some or even a lot of players in such a casual, relaxing kind of game where a chat isn't even required. Who cares if it isn't competing? Not every game have to be competing, Hearthstone feels more like a game you will play for now and then, and i didn't spend more than 2 euros in it and i'm winning pretty much right now by playing the game quite active, no need to &quot;pay to win&quot; you decide to not be bothered with grinding and want the best cards as fast as possible(most likely).<br />
<br />
As i said, if these things bother you, this isn't just your kind of game.</div></div><hr />

Or you can try answering the points he made right into the post you're answering, instead of simply trying to make a fool of him. And btw, having a better deck without playing doesn't make it less unfair and p2w, which was his main point. Of course you can get a better deck, yet it's still easier for paying users to get one, but that was already part of the points he listed. Do you think selling heroic SoO stuff in WoW wouldn't make the game unfair and p2w, because it's also obtainable from other players ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twothe</div><div class="date">2014-01-22, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a former Beta player and passionate trading card player here is my advice: give Hearthstone a try, the jokes are fun, but don't spent a single coin on it, the game isn't worth paying for at all.<br />
<br />
At the beginning you're lured into the game by the fancy and well done graphic and audio quality (and jokes) and the cards and rules are simple to understand. However if you take a closer look at the game, it has nothing to do with strategy at all. I can do my turn regularly under 10 seconds, just because the game is close to 100% predictable. It doesn't even really matter what cards the enemy is drawing, because you can play by the simple rule: kill all that hits the table, then play all you can. Once you understand that, the game becomes dull and repetitive. Your &quot;strategy&quot; doesn't matter, because there is simply no strategy in this game beside picking the right cards in the deck-builder, which rank between useless and obviously OP, and very often proof that the game-designers have close to no experience in the TCG-business.<br />
<br />
And then the game is 100% pay to win. I've been playing countless games, where I played my cards close to flawless against opponents who clearly lacked skill. But then one legendary hit the table and I lost. There was nothing that could have been done to prevent that and nothing that could have been done to solve it, except for giving Blizzard my money to buy my own legendaries. But paying for a such a crappy game that gets boring so quickly that you drop it after 2 weeks top? No thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amerissis</div><div class="date">2014-01-22, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I1. It's pay to win. People who spend more money can get more cards, better cards, more options to build better decks, meanwhile people who don't spend money need to grind for days to get even 1 deck of cards, and the pitiful rate of 1 gold per win. Even the MMR system cannot fix this unfairness at the top of the MMR curve, where high MMR players with bought cards have more than 50% win rate (like SC2). A person with 2000 skill rating + $100 spent is better than a person with 2000 skill rating. It's unfair. People should not be allowed to buy cards with real money.<br />
First of all, it's not true that it takes days to get a deck. You can do dailies for 40-100 gold a day and you get 10 gold for 3 wins, so you can easily get a deck per day (on average). Second, this is a CCG. That means you buy cards to play with. You're not familiar with Magic: the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc? So this is just like every other cardgame, except: YOU CAN GET EACH AND EVERY CARD WITHOUT PAYING A DIME! Try that in MtG and the likes...<br />
<br />
<br />
2. There is no release wipe. It allows people who, by dumb luck, have been in the beta to get an unfair card advantage, for absolutely no reason. Why should beta testers get to keep their account without a wipe, when people who weren't lucky enough to get into the closed beta are systemically and unfairly, of no fault of their owned, denied this advantage of early access? And some of these people are now defending their undeserved entitlement, which they should not get, at the expense of destroying fairness for everyone else.<br />
True, it's a tad unfair that people get to keep their cards. On the other hand, it would be completely unfair to perform a wipe for people who bought cards with money. They'd have to be reimbursed and can then buy all the cards again anyway. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. No ladder and ranking system. No plans for ladder and ranking systems.<br />
What? There is ladder and ranking system. No sure what you mean by this.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. No chat. No social features. No plans for chat, no plans for social features.<br />
Other then the simple emotes that we have, that's true, about the chat. And thank God for that! Are you forgetting the toxic community of WoW? Especially in PvP? I don't need my opponent swearing at me all the time, because he's losing. I don't play a card game for the chat. I have Skype for that. And can't you chat with people on your friendslist? That would work. No social features is nonsense. You can befriend people, even see them (and chat?) when they're in other Blizzard games. You can even see your last opponent after the game ended, so you can add them to your friendslist if you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Flawed reward model that rewards players for tanking their rating and farming noobs by giving these abusers more gold, more quickly.<br />
Wut? Didn't you just make the argument that you get 1 gold for a win and that's not enough? Yet you claim it's already abused? And you can't farm 'noobs', as you'll rise in ranking, so you'd need to lose a lot as well and even if you do that, there is nothing to gain at lower ranks. You don't get more gold or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Per-usage microtransaction of $2 to play Arena. This would be as outrageous as Valve charging $2 to queue All Pick in Dota 2. Or if Microsoft charged $2 to make an Office document with no option of buying Microsoft Office. This is arguably the most greedy business model in existence.<br />
Or gold, which you get for free. And if you win (if I remember correctly) 3 games, you earn as much gold as you spend and you can keep doing Arena essentially for free.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that cards can be grinded at a snail's pace changes nothing, because other people who have spent more money still have the advantage of more cards, better cards, more choices, and a easier ability to adapt to a changing metagame, which isn't possible via grinding.<br />
That changes everything. Every other card game out there makes you buy cards to play. You don't even get a basic deck for free. And don't try to compete with just the basic deck that you bought, because you will be obliterated by people who bought cards for years. This is the only one where you can get ALL cards for free. Not just a basic set or anything, but ALL of them. You just don't understand what kind of game this is.</div></div><hr />

Not just a basic set or anything, but ALL of them. You just don't understand what kind of game this is.<br />
<br />
Have you ever played any flash CCG game ? This concept is the base of almost every single one of them. Any card can usually be obtained without paying, but if you don't, you have to spend your life on endless grinding in the game. To keep on my last post comparison, Tyrant is the exact same. There are multiple currencies in the game allowing you to get different packs of cards, all of these can be obtained directly in game without paying anything, that's just way slower. That's still pay to win. Just a simple question (already asked few posts above): do you think selling heroic SoO stuff in WoW wouldn't make the game unfair and p2w, because it's also obtainable for other players ?<br />
<br />
People need to feel they don't &quot;have to&quot; pay, this is exactly how p2w games binds people to them. You don't want to leave a game where you spent countless hours trying to get something, while people often have no problem leaving a game on which they paid right at the beginning for an advantage.<br />
<br />
And for your first point, I guess you mean card pack, not deck, a pack is 5 random cards, a deck is 30 cards matching together.</div></div><hr />

Sadly that's the way lots of games work now.<br />

Beta is soooo convenient for developers. They gain this magical almost unlimited joker &quot;Oh yeah, the game is broken, but well, it's beta, not our fault&quot;.<br />

Was mostly used on web applications for a long time (hi gmail), but seems to gain on the gaming developers. And I can understand that, they keep the best parts of both worlds (well, both parts for them) : money, and the magical joker for any failure on their side.</div></div><hr />

Maybe... but not alone. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Those starter decks from Trump seem outdated to me<br />
I just had a look at the Paladin deck and that one was nothing but random cards put together. Not sure why anyone would play that deck.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elestia</div><div class="date">2014-01-23, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the Trump starters are pretty lacking-- they're the most basic of basic cards you get at the start. If you could update them or perhaps build ideal decks, that would be great. I tried rebuilding my druid deck with the recommended cards,-- not that I expected them to work, but to at least try it out. The deck was garbage. There's maybe 4 minion removal in the druid deck... the rest card-draw battle-cry with no attack. <br />
<br />
Also as a few people have mentioned, there isn't a whole lot of strategy involved. Sure, you can predict what your opponent has, but most smart players of a class will have certain spells, so the game becomes predictable and a matter of luck. Examples: Playing as my rogue today against a warrior. I did a turn 3 alarm-o-bot with Norzdormu and 2 assasinates and a sap in my hand. That's gg, there's nothing he can do about it, except scramble a low cost 3:2 and hope to have a charge. Or when playing a mage, surviving long enough to cast your nukes. Or playing a priest, Mogu'shan warden with 2 divine spirits and inner fire (turn 4 -turn 5 gg). <br />
<br />
The game completely gets boiled down to minion removal at all costs (part of why the starter decks are so bad). Mages and priests (arguably Warlocks too) do so well because they're spells are so powerful--cheap and straightforward. All classes have removal, but most actually require some planning to set up. For example, Swipe and FoK are useless without spell power. That's not to say Arcane explosion doesn't need SP, but having a spell power rogue deck? I've seen it done, but it weird. Imo, hero based abilities is great, but when it comes down to who has the better balance of removal with damage that they can sneak in, the game is lacking, the rules and latitude in strategy is stagnated. If there is an exception, its likely unique to one class or another, like brawl for warriors, or auchenai soul priests for priests. Even then, these are weak examples because they don't necessarily require detailed execution or ensure a win when pulled off. They just help kill minions.<br />
<br />
I have fun playing so far. I've won amazing games, spent a few bucks for extra cards. (&quot;Testing the store, lol.&quot; In a beta. -.-) Pay to win? Yes it is a thing. I've seen some of the most ridiculous constructed decks. Just when you beat an epic/legendary and think, 'oh wow that's cool they got that card' no sooner do you think that, they use another 5 of them during the game, either winning by the skin of their teeth, or vice versa, where maybe you happened to pull one. Definitely not a game to take seriously, and as such, probably won't be spending more money on it.</div></div><hr />
