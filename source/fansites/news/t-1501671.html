Warlords of Draenor - Build 18156 Minimap<br />
The new build made some significant changes to the Draenor's minimap. You can find the previous version of the map here (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/DraenorNew.jpg).<br />

Mists of Pandaria - All Character Achievements Complete<br />
It appears that Хируко of Razuvious-EU (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/razuvious/%D0%A5%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE/advanced) has managed to complete all of the regular character achievements, along with 205 of the ~340 Feats of Strength. <br />
<br />
According to him (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1501393-All-WoW-achievements-100-complete?p=26569239#post26569239), Realm First of every class on the same day (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/achievements01.jpg) by transferring to a low population PvP realm and multiboxing while his guild killed anyone trying to level before him. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
One thing that confuses me is all the +20% damage increases. Surely damage increases are meaningless due to balancing?<br />
Some of them are transformative. Some are just something to make dinging 93 a bit cooler. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451902977360404480))<br />
<br />
So why are the Draenor perks random order? It's unbalanced and lacking customization, what's the pro?<br />
It's a reward for leveling, not character customization. With choice, people can become paralyzed about what's 'right'. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451946173016702976))<br />
<br />
Will there be new glyphs?<br />
Yes. Currently about 80, give or take. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451906451049418752))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
For Unholy Death Knights You are knocking down the Unholy Might cause of better secondaries any chance at a deeper explanation?<br />
That's heavily tied to our damage balancing pass, which hasn't started yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451901219066245120))<br />
<br />
Is the goal with AMS soaking to only allow a maximum of 100 RP to be possible from a fully absorbed shell? Big nerf to soaking.<br />
Yes, intentionally. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893185552216064))<br />
Is the rationale because you'd like to reduce GCD locking by DKs, or because you don't like balancing us around AMS soaking?<br />
Both. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451902397816635394))<br />
<br />
If seraphim depletes all the runic power we have, how will we build up enough to get a Verdict or SoR off before it expires?<br />
It's long enough that you'll be able to. Don't forget Haste! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451909666482565120))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
Why aren't balance druids bringing CoE? looks like they get fewest buffs/debuffs w/ motw and spell haste<br />
They bring Haste, Stats, and Physical Damage Vulnerability. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451904886158794752))<br />
<br />
Why is starfall hitting more targets? stars are capped at 20? why ever use insect swarm? does it a insane amount of dmg?<br />
Stars are capped at 30 with that. Insect Swarm accelerates your rotation, and does a lot of damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451945881617453058))<br />
<br />
Insect Swarm could be made spellstorm damage as well.<br />
Since it's only cast outside of Eclipse, it doesn't actually matter to gameplay, just matters for kit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451962263927128065))<br />
<br />
Does the Balance version of DoC give you a Starsurge from hitting Eclipse or casting the instant Healing Touch?<br />
Casting the instant HT. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451962672460738560))<br />
<br />
So Dream of Cenarius talent is just +20% Healing Touch? Seems pretty lackluster honestly<br />
It's not intended to be a DPS gain anymore. It's for better off-role ability. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451969473008766976))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
Hunter's Distracting Shot removed, possible to see it as a minor glyph? I'd be very sad to see the clutch plays go ;_;<br />
Raised the range of Growl so that you can use it in that way, for the majority of cases. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451907359355322368))<br />
<br />
Losing Widow Venom while other classes are keeping their MS debuffs- is the effect going to be baked into another ability?<br />
Pets (including non-exotics) can apply it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451962949825859584))<br />
<br />
why no Execute mechanic for Surv hunters, not Kill shot, but smthg else? 1 extra charge of &quot;LnL&quot; from BA when target below 30%?<br />
Not every spec needs to have an execute. In fact it's a pro that you have an option that doesn't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451992652452352001))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
.Is the idea with the redesigned Frost Bomb that we cast it only when we have FOF charges?<br />
Yes. May not be mentioned in the patch notes but it only triggers from FoF'd Ice Lances. (Tried all crits early in testing, was OP) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451893981643689985))<br />
So Basically, pattern is now FOF proc -&gt; Frost Bomb (if you have the talent) -&gt; Ice Lance -&gt; Ice Lance<br />
And it lasts 12sec, so keep using FoF procs while it's up, yeah. For min/maxing, you can leave FBomb down, and pool FoFs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451900116966719488))<br />
<br />
If Incanter's Flow is on average 15% increased damage, why would I want to spec into Rune of Power?<br />
Valid point; just haven't tune a precise tuning pass yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451903984849014785))<br />
<br />
Could Nether Tempest have a chance to generate arcane charges? Increased cast time on blast looks like a pain for PvP.<br />
See Perks. It becomes faster with charges. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451940589500502016))<br />
NT multi dotting was way to proc missiles, hence charges in PvP, now NT 1 target only = less procs, less charges.<br />
Only the most recent NT ever proc'd missiles. Your multidotting wasn't giving you any additional AM procs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451952599747407872))<br />
<br />
Brain Freeze has to make FFB instant cast or the spec will be ruined IMO.<br />
Frost's rotation was overwhelmingly instants, which caused numerous problems. Turning one of them into a cast time may feel... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451993619570782208))<br />
...like a nerf, but actually is better in the end. Encounters demand less movement, casting can be a thing in PvP, Haste valued. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451993859912761344))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
So will eminence still be tied to a crappy range and statue?<br />
Yes, but that's good for you, you can use it to your advantage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451901904193216512))<br />
<br />
Why Clash? Dealing with casters will suck so much without it. It's one of the more fun BrM tanking abilities.<br />
We cut Clash because it was redundant with their other stuns and Roll. We'd rather you Roll more (see Draenor Perks). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451993200077438976))<br />
<br />
Last Q/comment, and least. RE: Mistweaver: why no chi gen from SoM and CJL now?Don't understand the intent<br />
Several reasons. Biggest is to fix mana for Mistweavers. Now, more mana = more chi gen, by a significant degree = more chi ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451994446771417090))<br />
...spenders. That means spirit increases all parts of your healing, which is a good thing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451994672982806528))<br />
You can get some baseline amount of Chi from cheap sources (ReM, EH), still, so you won't be chi-starved. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451994988281212928))<br />

Will holy pally still be just absorb healing like currently ? and disc priest aegis. with the nerfs hope this is nerfed<br />
No, we're aiming to significantly tone down how much of Healadin throughput is absorption. We'll balance Disc and Healadin power. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451904618591576065))<br />
<br />
Retribution's passive perks are a bit passive, mostly just damage increases. Any chance we can see more interesting effects...<br />
We tried to strike a good balance of interesting vs simple, but I agree, Ret is more on the simple side. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451967258433040384))<br />
.Commonly, we used the Draenor Perks as a place to make tweaks to rotations that we wanted to make anyway. Better to... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451967397612642305))<br />
....ease into those rotational changes that way. In some cases, such as Ret, we were happy with their rotation as is. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451967560058023936))<br />
<br />
Will seal of insight still provide 10% spell haste?<br />
No; Seal of Insight no longer provides any haste, but a Holy passive (don't recall which one offhand) does instead. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451970570637160449))<br />
(Reason being that we are only doing full Haste, not Melee Haste or Spell Haste anymore, but only want Holy to benefit from it) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451970827664117760))<br />
And will haste work the same for all classes now or still no haste for melee dots?<br />
Still no haste for melee DoTs because they're not spells, you get increased resources from haste instead. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451975071901315072))<br />
Will that include the haste buff now that its nerfed to 5%?<br />
Yes. The 10% Attack Speed raid buff has been replaced with 5% Haste. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451975678338936832))<br />
<br />

Combat FoK bonus seems underwhelming compared to Sub/Mut. Chance of changing it?<br />
They have Blade Flurry on top of that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451903346891169792))<br />
<br />
interested in the thoughts behind fist/swords being able to be used for dispatch and daggers for sinister strikes? No compliants<br />
Intended to be 'okay' to use in case you are over a tier behind on the optimal weapons, but not optimal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451908877877932034))<br />
<br />
Hey. Hey you. Hey. I don't see several key major rogue glyphs in the auto-learn list.<br />
Auto-learn glyphs were chosen based on usefulness while leveling. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451944402848448512))<br />
<br />
Read as back front and 2 sides.so no back stabbing from the front. which makes a certain sort of sense<br />
Backstab is usable from the left, right, and back. Not the front. So 270degree usability radius. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451945137912827904))<br />
On the topic of Rogues: woo for making Assa viable with other weapons than daggers! Awesome!<br />
Kind of. It's *possible*, but not *optimal* to play Assassination with non-daggers. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451965499346137089))<br />
<br />
With Mind-Numbing and Paralytic gone, can we rogues have another poison? So there's, y'know, a choice?<br />
We're considering the limited poison situation. Instant Poison does work for Venom Zest at least, BTW. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451896908538068992))<br />
So again why is it a conditional worse version of a level 45 Monk talent as our ultimate mega one?<br />
Because different classes are different. They're weaker than you are without it. We balance the... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451991489510260736))<br />
...power of characters *with* talents. Talents don't need to be balanced cross-class. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451991696541089792))<br />

No mention of Earth Shield in the patch notes. Surely you are scrapping that, it's such a pain with multiple Shamans!<br />
Multiple Earth Shields can stack, not a pain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451894641260904448))<br />
So you are changing Earth Shield so 2 can be on the same target at a time finally?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451901578522263553))<br />
<br />
No Healing Tide Totem and no Unleashed Lightning. Can we expect elemental shamans single target to be bought significantly up?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451902594328166400))<br />
<br />
Is the ULE-Healing Rain buff being built into the baseline spell, or is HR just effectively getting nerfed 30% from that change?<br />
Do you not think Healing Rain needs a nerf, compared to live? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451903853735079936))<br />
<br />
Also Unleash Weapon was listed in mobility damage skills. But Unleash Fire/Frost/Wind no longer deal damage so uh... wat?<br />
They don't *directly* do damage, but they are a significant net damage gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451908191375220736))<br />
<br />
Any chance elemental could retain moving lightning bolt? Would be good to know now if I need to reroll for WoD Progression.<br />
You don't need to reroll. Elemental will be balanced around that change. Yes, we know it's a huge change. Sky isn't falling. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451992422877102081))<br />

The way that Gladiator Stance and the talent is worded, it seems like prot warriors who take it will still be able to tank<br />
We did that so that tanks still have 3 talent choices when tanking. If you goto Gladiator Stance, you can no longer tank. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451905291647332353))<br />
If you take the Gladiator Stance talent, you can still tank, with 5% extra DR, but none of the offensive benefits. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451905115297824768))<br />
Correction: When you take the Gladiator's RESOLVE talent, you get 5% DR in Def Stance, for tanking, and the OPTION to... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451905568953753600))<br />
...switch to the Gladiator STANCE to become a DPS, and NOT a Tank. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451905682871037953))<br />
Doesn't that lead to tanks going Gladiator Stance when not their turn to get hit, swap back in when their turn?<br />
Can't swap into or out of Gladiator Stance in combat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451905793764241409))<br />
<br />
With warrior shouts no longer generating rage, it appears the only way to start a fight with rage is Charge. Is that accurate? @Celestalon<br />
Yes. Charge in to start with Rage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451906758978449409))<br />
<br />
Will the Warrior Haste bonus modifier remain, and how will Headlong Rush scale haste with CD/GCD? 50% Haste = 50% reduction?<br />
No, the +50% haste from gear buff on warriors will be removed. Scales just like everyone else. 25% Haste = 1/1.25 = 80% GCDs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451968778075512832))<br />
<br />
is gladiator locked out of unwavering sentinel and bastion of defense. also is block being removed or reduced in glad?<br />
Unwavering Sentinel is Defensive Stance only. If you still find that you're able to tank in Gladiator stance, we'll adjust. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451992031682760704))<br />

This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />

The Haswell CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

wow...lost a lot of respect with that :/ tbh transferring to a low realm made it even worse as there wouldn't be enough people to organize against you, at least a medium/high realm could fight back... so you kinda ruined dozens of peoples mop enjoyment on release day all for the sake of feat of strengths &gt;.&lt; Also the fact you had your guild transfer to a different realm and back suggests it was a guild accomplishment not a personal one as they probably helped with all the others as well :/</div></div><hr />

Right? Talk about selfish. I knwo it's a low-pop server, but how was he everywhere at once to keep people from doing shit before him? His guild can't be watching every single level 1 tauren, orc, human, etc doing quests in areas where they arent.

<br />
That is definitely a shared account. Probably the whole guild takes turns doing different stuff.<br />
<br />
But this is why server first achievements are being removed. Can you imagine how many support tickets were put in by other players on that server regarding that guild. They weren´t just killing other players, they were doing everything possible to keep them from leveling, even their own faction. So the first two days of an expansion, when customer service is probably already flooded with tickets, you have this guild creating dozens more</div></div><hr />

To low pop realm transfer it may was free. You only had to pay for the guild transfer. <br />
Question: how did he manage to multibox from the same account. You cannot login twice. For multibox you must have different accounts. He got all the class realm first achies but how did he log in? <br />
Blizzard likes this gaming style because blizz likes party stile gaming. its kinda all for one (never know of it was one for all too)<br />
How did they kill same faction players?<br />

I think for some people, it becomes a compulsive addiction. To the point where he probably thinks that any time that ISN'T spent playing WoW is time wasted.<br />
I would also guess that this is probably the greatest achievement he's had in life to this point, which could explain why so much time and effort was put into it.<br />
<br />
Or he could just have unbelievably severe OCD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chronal Spire: Gone, it's a nice waterfall looking thing flowing down into Talador instead.<br />
Nagrand: More mushrooms! <br />
Gorgorond: They moved the Iron Horde shipyard bay thing into the north of the zone. Also, the vegetation is much greener.<br />
Shadowmoon Valley: Looks like a Draenei village in the north of the Zone was completely redone, also, looks like SMV has some mushroom caps as well. <br />
Tanaan Jungle: Something was removed from the Northwestern part of the zone.<br />
<br />
I don't get why people are getting excited at a recolor of Outland. The only selling point is garrisons and even then it's just farmland 2.0</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it kinda goes like this <br />
365 days * 10 years = 3650 days * 24 hours = 87,600 hours <br />
700 days * 24 hours = 16,800 hours <br />
87,600 hours / 16,800 hours = 5.2......hours <br />
means he has played at least 5 hours a day every day if he has played since release</div></div><hr />

The amount of stupidity in your comment is mind boggling. Draenor is being remade from the ground up. How in the hell is it a recolor? If there are any parts on the map that look old it's because the artists are using them as reference points so that Draenor is consistent with Outlands. Anything that looks the same on the current map is probably going to be removed and built over once they no longer need the reference.</div></div><hr />

As someone who multiboxes from time to time I can tell you that when I run I am number 1, 2, and 3 in damage done/dps as well as not rolling on gear against people on the extra two accounts.

<br />
Or he could just have unbelievably severe OCD.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume he went on a low pop server on the opposite faction that was dominant on that server, had multiple accounts and merged them after, and he didn't pay for guild xfer because he only had to invite them and they would be on that server, going in jade forrest at starting zones killing everybody in there.</div></div><hr />

Firstly, he earned them. Plenty of people earn achievements with the help of friends, granted this guy did it quite an extreme way, but he still earned them by organizing help etc from his friends and actually getting the realm firsts.<br />

I totally agree on that ! :) and about the multiboxing, i dont really care, as long as noone does that in a dungeon or raid - feel free to do it while questing ;)<br />
its another way to have fun, trying to manage more toons at a time - personally i would never do that, but i dont see it as unfair ...<br />
<br />
on another note - i dont care about achivments at all, but i see why some players who wants to be &quot;#1 - realm first, biggest baddest player&quot; can get annoyed by someone multoboxing, having guldies kill others who tryes to climb to the top of the mountain, so that THEY dont get &quot;realm first&quot; .... <br />

He didn't deserve those realm first achievements and frankly, he should be stripped of them.<br />

If he put as much effort and cold-heartedness into real life, he might actually achieve something of note. You know, outside of a video game.<br />

<br />
1) About the guy with the achievements. Did they start a new server or something? How do you get realm firsts at this point without a new server? (Edit: I mean realm first warlock etc. Not the heroic raiding achievements, I get why those may not have happened yet.)<br />
<br />
2) Am I reading this right about warriors? So now to get rage they have to charge. How are warrior protection tanks supposed to function? There are not many raid bosses where they have the &quot;luxury&quot; of charging the boss. I find that a lot of bosses have to be pulled to get them in the right position for the raid. (The tank stays in one spot then &quot;pulls&quot; the boss to that spot.) Not to mention trash packs that need to be pulled back because they are too close to other mobs. <br />
<br />
Maybe they can make taunt generate rage as well?<br />
<br />
Blizzard's change here seems a bit strange to me. On the other hand it's just alpha, and this xpac is not that engaging to me anyway, in my opinion of course.</div></div><hr />

There´s nothing wrong with what he was doing. Why would he get banned for any of it :)? If you dont want to be owned in pvp , dont join a pvp server. Its quite simple really. there´s no &quot;unfair&quot; in that at all.<br />

You are 100% correct. He shouldn't be honored on the front page, he should be shamed for being a scumbag who had to cheat to get realm first. He's lower than garbage, and I hope everyone remember that he's subhuman filth. <br />
<br />
Come on MMOC, you're better than posting about human garbage.<br />

Again how is this cheating in any way. IF you dont like being killed dont join a damn pvp server. Really i dont see the problem<br />

<br />
Yeah, thats kinda a sucky way to game the system and frankly unworthy of MMO-Champion of featuring such a scurrilous and dubious achievement by anyone. They essentially screwed over everyone on the realm unfortunate enough to be there while they tried to level up. This was not done as an individual effort involving skill and cunning but purely zerging a zone with toons and ganking them en mass for the purposes of strong-arming an achievement. Its wrong and its even more wrong for this site to highlight their thuggery. Shame on you, MMO-champion.</div></div><hr />

Kind of. It's *possible*, but not *optimal* to play Assassination with non-daggers. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
What exactly is the point of this? Either allow something or don't. Making it a sub-optimal option doesn't accomplish anything. Nobody will use it, and players that dow will almost certainly get kicked for doing so. Either make it a viable option, or don't implement it. A half-assed option is terrible.<br />
<br />
Any chance elemental could retain moving lightning bolt? Would be good to know now if I need to reroll for WoD Progression.<br />
You don't need to reroll. Elemental will be balanced around that change. Yes, we know it's a huge change. Sky isn't falling. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
And yet it remains a change not made because of a balance issue, and is not a net positive for fun. So then, why? Why are Ele Shamans apparently meant to be immobile turrets? Why do other class/specs have viable options that are spammable/near spammable for high mobility fights, but the one Ele option is being taken away?</div></div><hr />

But it is wrong to think he actually got that stuff all on his own characters just by playing the game. I mean think about it, and entire guild did a realm transfer JUST so he could get some server firsts. You really think he didn´t buy a low level alt from some guy who had most of the difficult achieves, and then on top of it the ´russian way´ with pvp achievments.. not hard to get the pvp stuff if you have the other team on your vent cooperating with you.</div></div><hr />

If they are upset about people just picking the good talents first, I think it's safe to say most wow players don't go to forums of any kind to see what the best options are, so the point is moot. Beyond that, it's not like leveling is hard to do in the first place, so the point is double moot. <br />
<br />
Eliminating customization and making the classes so similar is more of a problem I think then giving out options to pick the talents you like, even if a lot of people go for one talent more than others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Threats, really?<br />
<br />
<br />
wow.. While so many ppl have been talking about the impact of toxic behavior to the game. We see a crazy guy with his fake realm first..<br />
<br />
And he is Russian, ofc.. lol.. Man why Russians love to exploit/cheat everything they can in games? o.O<br />
<br />
I'd say your behavior is toxic, not to mention, racist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Watch it guys - Russian Mafia wannabe here!<br />
<br />
Rofl - what a sad loser.<br />
<br />
You mention mafia n some nerd in the same post, relevant how?<br />
<br />
<br />
why ami not suprised that its a russian who has all these and mmo champion shouldnt be praising him cos multiboxing is effectivly cheating, and we all know on the EU side atleast of wow what russians do in PVP they bot and cheat, please remove it from the front page and stop gloryfying cheaters<br />
<br />
Not racist in the slightest, you take one guy n blame a whole country. And how is multi-boxing cheating? Blizzard said it's fine, but I guess it's different when a Russian does it.<br />
<br />
Ofc the Mods, like usual, will do absolutely nothing about these posts, had it been directed against USA if the nerd was American, the Mods would have been fast with the ban hammers.<br />
<br />
<br />
well how come as soon as russians joined the EU servers which is stupid cos russia isnt part of the EU, there has been numerous people complaining about them il link you an offcial thread and most people think like me i dnt say the cheat and bot to be hurtful its a known bloody fact they cheat ofc other people from other countrys do aswell but russians are notorious for it.<br />
<br />
http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8965477907<br />
<br />
EU = Europe, not European Union, when it comes to servers, understand the difference, there's other non-EU countries participating, like Norway.<br />
<br />
If this website was an official website, you would have been banned, with the racists garbage you continue to spew, but seeing it as it's not n the mods are just some random people n they happen to be anti-Russia themselves, your comments will in no way get you in any sort of trouble.<br />
<br />
<br />
So bullying and griefing is acceptable now aslong as you're russian? Me thinks Russia needs to be knocked down a peg or two on this imaginery &quot;Untouchable&quot; list.<br />

Bullying and griefing isn't this whole thread? And how is &quot;bullying and griefing&quot; on a pvp realm? Especially after latest patch Timeless Isle that is all about griefing, never seen so much griefing since the game came out...perspective much?<br />
<br />
As for him being a no-lifer, so you guys r mad that a 'no-lifer' won an achiev from other 'no-lifers'? How does that make any sense? Either you care, or you don't, if you do, you are no-lifers too, only that guy does it much much better.<br />
<br />
One has to be suspicious why mmo-champion brought up how he got his realm first achievs, not like they wouldn't expect flaming.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can defend your sad little hero all you want, but it's still cheating. Look up what the word exploitation means.<br />
<br />
PvP is exploitation now on a pvp realm? Wow!<br />
<br />
I couldn't care less about that achiev-nerd, but I have trouble deciding what is most sad, what he did or people responding so negatively to it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KurenaiXIII</div><div class="date">2014-04-21, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the topic of Rogues: woo for making Assa viable with other weapons than daggers! Awesome!<br />
Kind of. It's *possible*, but not *optimal* to play Assassination with non-daggers. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
What exactly is the point of this? Either allow something or don't. Making it a sub-optimal option doesn't accomplish anything. Nobody will use it, and players that dow will almost certainly get kicked for doing so. Either make it a viable option, or don't implement it. A half-assed option is terrible.<br />
<br />
Any chance elemental could retain moving lightning bolt? Would be good to know now if I need to reroll for WoD Progression.<br />
You don't need to reroll. Elemental will be balanced around that change. Yes, we know it's a huge change. Sky isn't falling. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
And yet it remains a change not made because of a balance issue, and is not a net positive for fun. So then, why? Why are Ele Shamans apparently meant to be immobile turrets? Why do other class/specs have viable options that are spammable/near spammable for high mobility fights, but the one Ele option is being taken away?<br />
<br />
Iiiiiiiiiiiii'm sorry, are you whining about being an 'immobile turret'? Spriests would like to talk to you. And arcane mages.<br />
<br />
All you elemental shamans need to suck it up and learn how to stand and cast. ;P</div></div><hr />

Excuse me? Mushrooms? In Nagrand?<br />
<br />
There aren't supposed to be mushrooms in Nagrand, it's the one zone in Outlands that was largely un-touched by the evil Gul'dan's warlocks ruined life on Draenor. That's why the Orcs had to leave Draenor, the world was dying, except for Nagrand.<br />

Last time I checked, there weren't any Mushrooms.<br />

<br />
It wasn't an exploitation. If you can prove he used a third party program to have his characters all cast spells at the same time in response to his current character casting, then that would be an offense against the ToS. But Blizzard has routinely defended and allowed multi-accounts and multi-boxing. Is what he did absolutely scummy? Certainly - and anyone who thinks it was great or fun or cool is also a scumbag (look at their inability to type or form a proper sentence and you can guess their age range and the kinds of games the favor (fps's anyone?) They're a lower class of human being, and they're prevalent on the net and in any type of online, multiplayer game.<br />
<br />
And look at the language the character is spelling their name with and tell me if you think that individual and his peers have even the same level of comprehension of &quot;morality&quot; as everyone on here who finds him deplorable. Different part of the world, different values (it's why they live in a shit hole and the rest of us get to have it a bit nicer, play nice and others will play nice with you). Neither here nor there, I do have to applaud him and his friends for their commitment to help him earn such a comprehensive slew of achievements. But please bear in mind that Realm Firsts don't mean anything, and they're not going to be around anymore (they encourage the worst kind of behavior during the start of a new expansion), so put it in perspective; it's a game after all.</div></div><hr />

I agree completely when it comes to Spriests. They have the same issue (amongst others). Less certain about Arcane Mages though. I think they have a few more options, but I don't play one, so I really can't say.<br />
<br />
We've stood and cast before. Then we were taken to the promised land. Where we no longer had to stick to our spot, and had some mobility given to us. It was amazingly fun! And now it's been taken away for no real reason. I honestly believe that any changes need to be measured against two things. 1) Balance. 2) Fun. Since it's not a balance issue (it had very little impact on our DPS) but it provided us with a fun perk, then there is an issue with this decision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
We want people to have interesting choices that's why we're changing the talent trees. MOP mantra<br />
<br />
Choice bad, simple good, people not us stupid WOD mantra<br />
<br />
<br />
You're missing the point - they're not going to give you MEANINGLESS choices because the nitpicking theorycrafting crowd will beat the topic to death screaming their right with pages and pages of meaningless math that demonstrate that some of the time things work slightly in their favor. It's imbecilic and infuriating, especially when the design team has bluntly stated - &quot;this is what we want X to be, if you get it to do Y, we will change it&quot; - that's basically a polite way of saying, STOP TRYING TO BREAK THE FKING GAME - would you like the Dev's to spend more time making content, or spending that time constantly patching the game to keep you from playing the game in a way that doesn't fit within the balanced scheme they are trying to create?<br />
<br />
If they want you to make a meaningful choice, they'll give you those options - because most of the time there will be a clear, right answer, and sometimes it will be more subjective. But the fewer &quot;meaningless&quot; choices they give players, the ones that were initially added for flavor but have devolved into wastes of space for people to bicker over, the better off the game is. People can play the game without arguing over it.</div></div><hr />

Arcane mages are effectively tied to one spot for the majority of their DPSing. RoP, even now, doesn't afford much mobility. <br />
<br />
I used to play ele shaman, too. <br />
<br />
It -is- a balance issue, but not one specifically of Elemental DPS. Blizzard -intentionally- wants casters to have to hold still to do maximum damage. It's a balance change in the sense of the overall health of the game, as opposed to 'balance for elemental shaman DPS'. Maybe it's because I've mained mage since BC, but even playing Frost--the most mobile of mage specs, pretty much, as far as I'm concerned--maximizing my ability to stay in one place and pump out spells makes me feel more skilled than running around and not losing DPS from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Russian isn't a race my friend, so this isn't racist. Sorry if you are an &quot;honest&quot; russian player and I offended you in any way, that wasn't my point. Of course, not ALL russians are cheaters/exploiters, but you have to admit that russians have this well known &quot;tradition&quot;, maybe it's a cultural thing, I don't know.. Everyone with a little bit of experience in online games know this. <br />
<br />
If I say Japanese people are well known for their discipline, english people are well know for their rock bands, russian people are well know for their ballet and unique architecture, am I being racist too, or whatever you want to call me? because for me, it's the same thing.<br />
<br />
Back to my post. Yes, In my opinion, russian or not, multiboxing is an example of toxic behavior, because you are paying to get advantage and trying to overlap the game rules. When the cases are isolated, you won't feel the problem, but when it becomes a trend and everyone start multiboxing to get advantages... Blizzard will probably love everyone paying 4+ subs for a while, but the game will become pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a little confused why it's okay for one class, like Frost Mages, but not another, like Ele Shaman, to have an ability that they can reliably use on the move.<br />
<br />
The Ele rotation is one of the simplest in the game at the moment. One of the fun parts of it though, was in having *something* to be able to contribute in a high mobility fight. And it's a pretty small something really. But it's a cool perk to have, and a fun one at that. I get that they want Hunters to sort of own the mobility ranged DPS. I don't have a problem with that. But LB on the move doesn't even come close to bumping into that territory.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I know it isn't a huge deal, but for me it's removing a rather fun part of the class. In my opinion, when you pull away something that is fun, the reasoning should be of the highest calibre. And honestly, I'm just not seeing it here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being a bigot against another people isn't bigoted if they happen to have the same skin color? The meaning of the insults doesn't change with color. Usually when someone attacks another group of people, it's called racism, because in essence it's the same thing, it's pathetic that you are trying to make excuses.<br />
<br />
What is well known is that attacking Russians is a substitute for racism that society frowns upon, saying similar things against blacks, jews is &quot;wrong&quot; but since Russians are white and cockblockin' US imperialism, bigoted words cease to be bigoted because it's convenient by a lot of people to overlook. Western media is a lot to blame, Russia is basically described in cold war / comic book terms..<br />
<br />
<br />

Cultural? You think a country's culture includes something like computer games? I don't think you know anything about Russian culture, if anything they value trust, friendship, a lot.<br />

<br />
So could I also call you &quot;racist&quot; for thinking all western people are intolerant, ignorant about Russia and believe in everything the media says? <br />
I understand what you are trying to say, but can you see the flaw in this logic of &quot;racism&quot;? And I also could consider this an insult, if I wanted, you see?<br />
<br />
Imo, these are internet fallacies, the main concept of racism is when you consider different races to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other. And this intention is FAR away from my post, seriously. Sometimes someone can make just a positive or negative critic, but that doesn't necessarily means racism, xenophoby, homophoby or whatever.<br />
<br />
The only thing I said was a question &quot;why they like to cheat/exploit so much in games?&quot; and that they are well known for this behavior, that's it. I think you are over exaggerating my words to prove something. Looks like you got what all other people said in this thread and are putting it in my mouth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cultural? You think a country's culture includes something like computer games? I don't think you know anything about Russian culture, if anything they value trust, friendship, a lot.<br />
<br />
I said MAYBE it's a cultural thing, because how you behave in different situations online or offline usually have something to do with your cultural aspects.<br />
Btw, I have two friends which part of their family is from Russia and I talk to them about this sometimes. But they are open minded people, so we talk about our cultural differences more freely. This is an interesting subject, specially, because people of my country (also) have some kinds of peculiar behavior in online games.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you say praise and insults are the same thing? No, they are the opposites of each other. Just because you can say something nice doesn't mean it's suddenly ok to make all kinds of insults!<br />
<br />
I meant talking about the behavior of people, no matter if this behavior is seen as &quot;good&quot; , &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;different&quot; by some eyes.<br />
<br />
Again, As I already said, the point wasn't to offend anyone, but try to understand a kind of human behavior in a specific environment - online games. However, I understand how you act defensively because of this stereotype from the gaming community. Maybe it was my english fault that made it sound like an insult.</div></div><hr />
