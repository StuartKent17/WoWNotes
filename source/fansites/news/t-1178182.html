Dev Watercooler: Scenarios<br />
We recently began revealing the Scenarios you’ll experience at level 90 in World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria on our preview site (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/). As the final tweaks are being made, we thought it would be a good time to sit down with Senior Game Designer Dave Maldonado and Game Designer Jonathan LeCraft for a little behind-the-scenes perspective on this unique new system.<br />
<br />
Q: What do Scenarios bring to World of Warcraft that we haven't seen before?<br />
<br />
Dave Maldonado: From a technological standpoint, almost everything in the system is new. Players are obviously going to see the World of Warcraft they know and love when they're running Scenarios, but all of the technology driving what we can do with Scenarios is new, and we took that as an opportunity to really indulge in new ways of interacting with the players, the NPCs, and the environment. It was a lot of work to design the technology, with a whole new UI, and new tracking systems and so forth, and while that programming was going on, we got to dream up and implement a lot of randomization and many new things for monsters to do and for the environment to do.<br />
<br />
Jon LeCraft: With Scenarios, we can do even more than we could previously do with group quests, because even with phasing and all of our options in the outdoor world, there were a number of things that we still wanted to bring to the game. We can now change the environment and change the ways things spawn and change the behavior of enemies on the fly, and that opens up nearly infinite possibilities.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
DM: My favorite example is the concept of a ship that you want to destroy by setting it on fire. So you could storm the ship, kill everyone on-board, and then burn it down. But what happens when you decide to sneak on to the ship, leave everyone alive, and set the fire while they're all standing around? In Scenarios, we have a lot of flexibility to imagine the different ways that players might choose to play, and have the NPCs and the environment react to that more naturally. The result is -- you're going to see all those NPCs on the ship jump off because it's on fire, and then look back at it in amazement. Other NPCs that were making deliveries to the ship before it became a floating inferno are going to react to the change in their world. Instead of trying to put the box that they're carrying on the boat, or despawning and disappearing before your eyes, or something else unrealistic, they're going to stop and gawk at the flames.<br />
<br />
Q: We've seen Scenarios compared to dungeons a lot, yet you're comparing them to group quests. What aspects of Scenarios are like dungeons, and what aspects are like group quests, and what’s just new?<br />
<br />
JL: For one, you're in a group and you start the Scenario by going into the Dungeon Finder, and if you aren't in a group, one will be provided for you. That's dungeon-like. Also, Scenarios have a boss at the end.<br />
<br />
DM: The boss at the end brings everyone together.<br />
<br />
JL: They're very different than the bosses you're used to, though, because Scenarios are designed to be completed by three characters of any spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/thumb/IF1O0NUKYBZ31344974792476.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/IF1O0NUKYBZ31344974792476.jpg) <br />
<br />
DM: We're still tuning and discussing exactly how difficult Scenarios will be, but there are many major differences between Scenario bosses and dungeon bosses. Scenario bosses often can't be tanked, or tanking isn't very helpful. They can be easier than dungeon bosses, because they have to be feasible for three DPS players, but they can also be much more difficult than dungeon bosses, because they can have very high damage attacks that must be avoided by the players. These encounters aren't designed in a way that you can tank or heal through their massive attacks. You either pay attention to the signs that an attack is coming and avoid it, or you fail.<br />
<br />
JL: Because there won't always be a certain number of interrupts, or a certain amount of aggro control or healing in a Scenario, these boss encounters rely on placement, timing, and pattern recognition.<br />
<br />
DM: At the same time, there are many different things you can do to bosses in Scenarios. You can often crowd-control them, or stun them, or interrupt what they're doing. This would make them very easy to deal with in other circumstances, but they have a huge health pool and the ability to deal massive amounts of damage. Very few can be &quot;tank-and-spanked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Q: As World of Warcraft players, how would you describe the Scenario experience?<br />
<br />
DM: Watching other players test Scenarios, and testing them ourselves, they’re really what I would call a “pure WoW” experience. They give you the option to do a lot more with your character than in other aspects of the game. In PvP, for instance, there isn’t a lot of room for experimenting, or using all of your spells, or even using most of your spells -- unless you want to get killed. In Scenarios, we see every class, every spec, and every style of play being viable. Furthermore, Scenarios are places where you get to experiment with how you move through the environment. There are all sorts of things you can skip, or choose to interact with that someone else might skip, and those decisions you make will have a noticeable impact on what happens next in that Scenario.<br />
<br />

<br />
JL: I keep coming back to that. Choosing to interact with things is a constant in Scenarios. A huge ghost mob might be mind-controllable. An urn might be something that you can try to access, and it might drop a few gold for you while spawning a couple of mobs that you have to deal with.<br />
<br />
Q: What’s coming next for this system?<br />
<br />
DM: More Scenarios! We’ve got a lot of really cool ideas, and this is content that we hope to make even more of as we start producing post-expansion content patches.<br />

While I am looking forward to this, I am a bit disappointed as well. When I first heard about this, I had hoped it would be more similar to instant adventures in rift that have dynamic groups, scaling, and varying goals with bosses at the end. The major difference being that they scale from 1 player to any size, and more importantly they occur in the real world, so instead of taking people out of the world they help add to the feel of a dynamic living world. Still looks like fun though.</div></div><hr />

I agree.I like the Guild Wars 2 dynamic quest system so Blizzard putting these scenarios in Warcraft will add a little dynamic flavor to Warcraft too.Pretty awesome that they are going to add more with each content patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing and tanking are always useful, even in scenarios. Did one with a Resto Shaman and a Hunter while on my Mage, never once did I feel that another DPS would somehow make it more fun, easier, or go by faster...not like the bosses have much health or enrage timers. Anyone can play what they want when they want to play it in a scenario. Fun times were had by all, even the forum posters who just want to watch the world complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel like tanks won't run into an issue because as far as questing is concerned, those specs don't usually have issues with damage output anymore, and scenarios will be more akin to group quests than full dungeons (let alone I highly doubt these things are going to be competitive). As far as healing is concerned, a friend of mine thought of an alternative to the norm that could be used in scenarios and questing in general: heal allied NPCs rather than killing enemies. That is, an objective could say &quot;kill 10 enemies or assist 10 allies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, my biggest concern is that Scenarios will help to carry the ability to play the game AFK in Stormwind or Orgrimmar into Mists more than they will accomplish anything else. One of the defining traits that should separate the multi-player aspects of an MMO from any other game is the necessity of teaming up with players in the game world to accomplish goals, rather than being able to queue up for a match or event to accomplish absolutely everything. As much as I would like to view this as a positive new direction, their potential to perpetuate issues that Blizzard has already philosophically began to defend (i.e.: their sympathetic tone towards those who don't want to join a guild/would avoid social interaction all together in a game that is meant to be Massively Multi-player) is what keeps me jaded drives my skepticism.</div></div><hr />

Or, if you queue solo, you get put in a random group ala dungeon finder.<br />

I hope they make Caverns of Time style Scenarios. Take important events from books and let us experience them in-game at appropriate levels and the like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A cynic might certainly say that this is indeed veeerrry similar to certain features of another game. Which is no bad thing really, all post WoW mmo's (at least near or at AAA level) have benefitted the behemoth in one way or another. New feature is new, similarity is par for the course. We all win whether GW2 or WoW players.</div></div><hr />

As I read it: the big difference is the dynamic nature of things but ...<br />
<br />
I thought you needed to go to the place n the open world where scenarios are played ...<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of joining scenarios from within the dungeon finder ...<br />
<br />
Cross server open world zones should help keep the scenarios fresh but ONLY if you can join them from the world zone you are playing in...<br />
<br />
Any confirmation about that ?</div></div><hr />

Oh well, when Rift seemed to copy WoW 1:1, people had a good laugh. Now there are design similarities and Blizzard is the bastard company that copies others. To the point where they want to be like a game that isn't even out and there is no prediction how sucessfull it will be? Makes sense. I hear they put lazorZ into WoW when they heard SWTOR would be HUGE!<br />
<br />
Whatever, lets see how they pan out. People have asked for things to be doable without the holy trinity. Here they are now. Naturally one must complain immediately. I guess I try them out first.</div></div><hr />

They are basically phased group quests. Several of them use the barely used locations on map you wondered why are they even there (Greenstone village, the other in Jade Forest). I bet the only cool is the Theramore, which isnt open for testing. The only reason behind them is to give us yet another way to farm small amounts of valor tbh</div></div><hr />

<br />
No but seriously, I'm fairly sure that these scenarios are unique from the GW2 world bosses and whatnot. I haven't tested scenarios on the MoP beta, but I have done tons of world events in GW2 and I very much doubt they'll be even similar. And also, HOW can people be so stupid that they believe the ruler of mmorpgs wants to copy from a game that's not out, that's not been proven a success? GW2 is hyped, it's loved, people want it...but so was SWTOR. Don't forget that. It might become a huge success, it might fall flat in the future. Those that hype and love it now, might change their minds...especially when seeing how so many have a tendency to evolve the &quot;Ex partner&quot;-syndrome with games.<br />
<br />
The more options in the various games, the better. I won't moan that this one copies the other buuaaah, ESPECIALLY not when the features are worlds apart.<br />

Derp? It says loud and clear, you don't need healer or tank, they're useless or at best a helper in healers case. L2dps with your class. <br />

<br />
I'm glad that there's an activity that doesn't make me depend on strangers with moodswings.<br />
<br />
&quot;L2dps with your class&quot;?<br />
<br />
Sure, I can reroll as DPS. Or just quit playing, since I don't find DPS as fun as what I do play (healer/tank) in my case.<br />
<br />
Or queue up for LFD for hours where the wait times will be ike horrible for healers and tank because all the DPS are in the Scenario queue.<br />
<br />
They already almost eliminated the need for tanks in LFR (1-2 is enough when back in TBC 4-5 was needed for 25-mans) and now they are going down the &quot;3-man dungeon&quot; route with healers/tanks not even being welcome.<br />
<br />
The success of WoW/MMO was to a large extent thanks ti the need for various different classes to cooperate. Step by step Blizzard have eliminated this by simultanously first homogenizing roles so that all healers, tanks and dps are increasingly identical respectively so you essentially have just 3 &quot;classes&quot; (roles). Then further by step by step decreasing the size of groups: 40-mans became 25 mans, then 25-mans increasingly being phased out in favor of 10-mans, the remaining 25-mans needing less and less healers and tanks, now 5-mans are being reduced to 3-mans by entirely eliminating tanks and healers.<br />
<br />
If you look at the overall pattern, WoW has over the years moved more and more towards the end goal of turning it into a single-player game. The &quot;Multiplayer&quot; part is constantly shrinking.<br />

scenarios will probably be a good place to learn new players raid mechanics, good idea.<br />

Scenarios will be a good place to teach players raid without tanks and healers. Makes sense.</div></div><hr />

You could, I dunno, queue up for a scenario as a tank/healer with a guild group? or just not do them at all! by the looks of things there seems to finally be plenty to do at level cap.<br />

It'll be a good place to teach players that hey! sometimes when the big enemy with high health does a fancy looking attack, you might wanna make sure you're not taking it to the face.</div></div><hr />

no they aren't. This is nothing like gw2 dungeons at all, seriously they dont need to counter gw2 dungeons because wow has their own style of dunegons already.<br />

Do you quest as a healer or tank? no so stfu, this is supposed to mimic group questing..<br />

I agree.I like the Guild Wars 2 dynamic quest system so Blizzard putting these scenarios in Warcraft will add a little dynamic flavor to Warcraft too.Pretty awesome that they are going to add more with each content patch.<br />
<br />
this has nothing to do with GW2. This is simply to try and bring back group questing. And quite frankly i think GW2 should fear wow. No end game is really not going to get them anywhere is it? especially when we've seen many mmos fail because there isnt anything to do when you reach level cap. Sorry, truth hurts<br />

Ohh look what we have here a gw2 fanboy. Hey creamy flames, why you so mad? it seems you are just raging at the screen because of scenarios. You look intimidated, chill bro, its cool i think the GW2 forums are a few clicks away, how about you go cry to your buddies about the terrifying things you saw today in the wow forums :D</div></div><hr />

Don't stress mate besides the start of cata where heroic dungeons were a decent challenge , Post TBC nothing outside of HM raids is difficult now, you could clear these with 3 tanks with 1 tank being afk the whole time.<br />
<br />
Yes it might take a bit longer but like many have said I doubt players will run them more then a few times before sticking to just hc dungeons which are going back to WOTLK difficulty and in some cases even easier from the start.</div></div><hr />

So LFD might be as crappy for healers and tanks in MoP as it is for dps in cata with wait times of 20 to 40 min? Sounds fair to me. :)</div></div><hr />

Except GW2's dynamic events are nothing like the example given. There's nothing in GW2 like being able to approach a ship with different tactics and have a different outcome. GW2's dynamic events are basically &quot;Go to an area, kill some bears or collect some nuts or chop down some trees to progress the bar, fail or win&quot; and a ton of variations thereof. <br />
<br />
WoW scenarios don't exactly sound like that...</div></div><hr />

30-40% of the player base? If that were the case we would have well under 5 minute queues for DPS in the dungeons.<br />
<br />
That aside, I haven't heard anyone mention enrage timers on these scenarios so why would someone queuing as a Tank or Healer cause the group problems? Tanks do decent enough damage these days and most healers can still do some damage. Additionally there is always dual spec if you feel you absolutely must DPS for these.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know they won't release much content with each patch. These scenarios are a copy of Rift's Instant Adventure queues. Everytime they copy something, it gets a once over and then never revisited again.</div></div><hr />

they are EXACTLY like that. You kill anything red, you ignore any mechanics from lolbosses and sometimes you do stuff to fill your bar by picking up random sh1t, more often than not some beverage. WOOP!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everybody had a quick 15 minutes fun, everybody happy. No down times. No headaches.<br />
<br />
As I read it: the big difference is the dynamic nature of things but ...<br />
<br />
I thought you needed to go to the place n the open world where scenarios are played ...<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of joining scenarios from within the dungeon finder ...<br />
<br />
Cross server open world zones should help keep the scenarios fresh but ONLY if you can join them from the world zone you are playing in...<br />
<br />
Any confirmation about that ?<br />
<br />
They are easier than those dungeons, as any three players can do them. There is some downtime in some of the scenarios, waiting for the NPC to walk forward or a new part of the event to start. You queue for Scenarios like you queue for dungeons right now, there is no place in the world to go to queue for them. <br />
<br />
Closer to group quests than dungeons in terms of difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Like in Warhammer Online? That was really cool, but good luck finding players for a lvl 10 scenario in 1 year.</div></div><hr />
