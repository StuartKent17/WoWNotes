Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Druid—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Monk. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Monk in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Monks were introduced in Mists of Pandaria, and their story is woven directly into the expansion’s rich and vibrant lore. Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy that’s unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts. They seek spiritual balance in life and in combat, and as dangerous as Monks can be on the battlefield, they’re rarely looking to pick a fight without just cause. They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace—then expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Perhaps most surprisingly, Monks are also adept at producing powerful brews they consume to aid them in battle.<br />
<br />
In Legion, we’re focusing on making sure Monk abilities and gameplay better match the class’s vivid backstory. We’re also looking at abilities that already lend themselves well to the Monk’s character, but whose mechanics are in need of polish.<br />
<br />
Brewmaster[/b][/size][/center]<br />
The brewmaster is a quirky character, though dangerous when underestimated. Brewmasters may seem to struggle with balance as they chug their concoctions in the middle of a fight, but this unpredictable behavior is far from foolhardiness. Most opponents barely have time to process the erratic nature of the brewmaster’s fighting tactics before they find themselves laid low—possibly the result of a keg smash to the head. When an opponent actually manages to land an attack, it’s often unclear how much the brewmaster feels it . . . if at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;The brewmaster is a quirky character, though dangerous when underestimated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
The gameplay for Brewmasters hasn’t quite fit their archetypes to this point. Rather than being the tricky martial artists, staggering around with an evasiveness that frustrates their opponent while being a little squishy when taking an unmitigated blow, Brewmasters have been more focused around large absorption shields and clutch self-healing. Our new design approach is to get more gameplay depth out of their strong, thematic abilities. Instead of Chi as a resource, which had little depth for Brewmasters, we’re switching to charges on Brew abilities that other abilities still interact with.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core defensive and offensive combat abilities for Brewmaster Monks:<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive<br />
<br />
Ironskin Brew<br />
<br />
Instant, 20 sec recharge, 3 charges<br />
Increases your Stagger amount by an additional 60% for 6 sec.<br />
Shares charges with Purifying Brew.<br />
<br />
<br />
Purifying Brew<br />
<br />
Instant, 20 sec recharge, 3 charges<br />
Instantly purifies all of your staggered damage.<br />
Shares charges with Ironskin Brew.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gift of the Ox<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
When you take damage, you have a chance to summon a Healing Sphere visible only to you. Moving through this Healing Sphere will heal you for 25% of your maximum health.<br />
This chance is increased the lower health you are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Elusive Brawler<br />
<br />
Each time you are hit by a melee attack, you gain 20% (with Mastery from typical gear) Dodge, until your next successful Dodge.<br />
Also increases your attack power by 20% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Offensive<br />
<br />
Keg Smash<br />
<br />
40 Energy, 15 yd range, Instant, 8 sec cooldown<br />
Smash a keg of brew on the target, dealing strong damage to all enemies within 8 yds and reducing their movement speed by 50% for 15 sec.<br />
Reduces the remaining cooldown on your Brews by 4 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tiger Palm<br />
<br />
50 Energy, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Attack with the palm of your hand, dealing minor damage.<br />
Reduces the remaining cooldown on your Brews by 1 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackout Strike<br />
<br />
Melee Range, Instant, 3 sec cooldown<br />
Thwack the enemy with your weapon, dealing moderate Physical damage.<br />
Shares cooldown with Breath of Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
Breath of Fire<br />
<br />
Instant, 3 sec cooldown<br />
Targets in front of the caster take minor Fire damage. If affected by Keg Smash, they will also burn for minor Fire damage over 8 sec.<br />
Shares cooldown with Blackout Kick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Brewmaster-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Elusive Dance<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Purifying Brew also grants up to 15% Dodge for 6 sec, based on the level of Stagger damage purified.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mistweaver[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Mistweavers are unique among those who heal. The energies they channel are mysterious, oftentimes misunderstood by commoners—who rarely travel beyond the borders of their homelands—as some form of folk medicine. But those who weave the mists wield the power of life’s essence, using a mixture of preventative and restorative spells to mend their allies’ wounds. The inner tranquility that guides mistweavers allows them to sustain their healing for long periods of time, and gives them the strength to care for multiple injured allies. <br />
<br />
&quot;...those who weave the mists wield the power of life's essence, using a mixture of preventative and restorative spells to mend their allies' wounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Our goal with Mistweaver Monks is to accentuate the existing characteristics that define them, and resolve some core gameplay issues. In simple terms, this means we’ve redesigned their abilities so that you can directly use the spells you want rather than having to set up an excessive amount of other abilities first.<br />
<br />
The most prominent example of this was Renewing Mist, which served primarily as a setup for Uplift; we’ve reworked Renewing Mist to stand on its own, and replaced Uplift with a couple of new spells: Vivify and Essence Font. In addition, a new passive Soothing Mist mechanic gives Mistweavers a unique healing style with variable efficiency, over which you have more direct control.<br />
<br />
We’re also focusing Mistweavers solely on healing, rather than supporting a type of mixed attack-healing gameplay that felt awkward and ultimately didn’t live up to our goals for the spec—it was unintuitive, and chiefly useful as a mana management tool. Lastly, Mistweavers will now use Mana, not Chi, as a resource, since it reduced choices and restricted gameplay in many situations.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat healing abilities for Mistweaver Monks:<br />
<br />
Mastery: Gust of Mists<br />
<br />
Your targeted heals also cause a gust of healing mists, instantly healing the target for a minor amount (increasing with Mastery from gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Soothing Mist<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your Effuse, Enveloping Mist, and Vivify also trigger Soothing Mist.<br />
After casting these spells, you continue to channel healing mists into the target, healing them for a minor amount every 0.5 sec, until you take any other action.<br />
Developer Comments<br />
<br />
Need efficient healing? Cast any heal and let Soothing Mist continue to provide free healing as long as you feel comfortable!<br />
Need high-throughput healing? Cast any heal and move onto the next target in need of healing, without spending time on Soothing Mist.<br />
For Mistweavers, it’s OK to have open global cooldowns between heals—Soothing Mist fills these gaps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Effuse<br />
<br />
1.8% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
A fast and efficient spell, healing the target for a minor amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enveloping Mist<br />
<br />
6.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 2 sec cast<br />
Wrap the target in healing mists, healing them for a huge amount over 6 sec, and increasing healing received from your spells by 30%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Renewing Mist<br />
<br />
3.5% Mana, Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
You surround the target with healing mists, restoring a huge amount of health over 20 sec.<br />
If Renewing Mist causes any overhealing, it will travel to the most injured ally within 20 yds.<br />
When Renewing Mist heals, it has a 4% chance to increase the healing of your next Vivify by 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Essence Font<br />
<br />
8.0% Mana, 40 yd range, Channeled<br />
Unleash a rapid twirl of healing bolts at up to 6 allies within 25 yds, every 1 sec for 3 sec.<br />
Each bolt heals the target for a moderate amount, plus an additional moderate amount over 8 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vivify<br />
<br />
5.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
Cause a surge of invigorating mists around the target, healing them and their 2 nearest injured allies for a moderate amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Mistweaver-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Mistwalk<br />
<br />
40 yd range, Instant, 20 sec recharge, 2 charges<br />
Instantly dash to an ally, and heal them for a large amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Windwalker[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Among monks, none have mastered the martial arts as the windwalkers have, and few across Azeroth can fight with their grace. Windwalkers possess unparalleled physical finesse, and are capable of overwhelming their enemies with a dizzying flurry of punches and kicks. Their skill comes primarily from a lifetime of intense training and discipline, but the power they exhibit is shrouded in more mysticism than meets the untrained eye. The combination of their peak physical conditioning, state of inner calm, and leveraging of mystical chi makes windwalker monks a true force to be reckoned with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Windwalkers possess unparalleled physical finesse, and are capable of overwhelming their enemies with a dizzying flurry of punches and kicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Powerful themes fuel the Guardian Druid, but the gameplay falls short of delivering on them. In particular,<br />
Similar to Brewmasters, here we focused on getting more depth out of less complexity. Windwalkers’ new Mastery, Combo Strikes, encourages mixing a variety of abilities, which provides a constant gameplay hook that influences every ability they use and draws inspiration from classic fighting games. In addition, we’ve polished Storm, Earth, and Fire to remove some cumbersome mechanics. Windwalkers still use a combination of Energy and Chi, along with a heavy dose of short cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Windwalker Monks:<br />
<br />
Mastery: Combo Strikes<br />
<br />
Your abilities deal 25% (with Mastery from typical gear) more damage when they are not a repeat of the previous ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tiger Palm<br />
<br />
50 Energy, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Attack with the palm of your hand, dealing minor damage and generating 2 Chi.<br />
Tiger Palm has an 8% chance to make your next Blackout Kick cost no Chi.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackout Kick<br />
<br />
1 Chi, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Kick with a blast of Chi energy, dealing moderate Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rising Sun Kick<br />
<br />
2 Chi, Melee Range, Instant, 8 sec cooldown<br />
You kick upwards, dealing strong damage, and reducing the effectiveness of healing on the target for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fists of Fury<br />
<br />
3 Chi, Melee Range, Channeled, 20 sec cooldown<br />
Pummel all targets in front of you, dealing massive damage over 4 sec. Deals reduced damage to secondary targets.<br />
Can be channeled while moving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spinning Crane Kick<br />
<br />
1 Chi, Channeled<br />
You spin while kicking in the air, dealing moderate damage over 1.5 sec to enemies within 8 yds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Storm, Earth, and Fire<br />
<br />
Split into 3 elemental spirits, suited to attacking 3 or more enemies. Each spirit deals 50% of normal damage and healing.<br />
The Monk directly controls the Storm spirit, while Earth and Fire spirits mimic the Monk's attacks on different nearby enemies.<br />
Lasts until toggled off, or either Earth or Fire are destroyed.<br />
Developer Comment: Now a simple toggle—no targeting necessary! Spirits will automatically seek out nearby enemies to attack while you attack your target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Windwalker-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Hit Combo<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Each successive attack that triggers Combo Strikes in a row grants 1% increased damage, stacking up to 10 times.<br />
<br />

Not happy with no Fistweaving.<br />
<br />
Not happy with Soothing Mist being a passive... <br />
<br />
Let's just stand here not hitting any buttons to heal -- that sounds &quot;fun.&quot; I can already see that being removed next expansion for being too passive (and worthless).<br />
<br />
<br />
lol... I actually really enjoyed my mistweaver for the Channel Heal (I like channels), but whatever -- ALSO: somebody said they were removing alll of the combo builders they put on, and they were right lol... They just keep making everything basic. And they gave them a binding heal lol.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I can do MW as my main this expac... I might just stick to priest. Not cause the world is ending or balance!! but because it doesn't even sound fun anymore. :(</div></div><hr />

Oh wow, I thought soothing mist just continued for a few seconds after stopping channeling, which makes 100% more sense. They've gutted a fun alternative healer.</div></div><hr />

^ I agree, that's why I made my monk and excelled at her. I loved the Melee aspect, during SoO it was beast, they nerfed it a lot in WoD and I was hoping they'd bring it back. Now they are making MW the typical sit back and cast class. I'm glad I started maining my Paladin, I love their new changes. RIP Meistar, you had a good run.</div></div><hr />

Keep Fistweaving as a Option for people to do Heroics/LFR. Keep Soothing Mist as a channeled ability that can still be used (Passive is such a horrible for a channeled ability). Only change I see is WW monks SEF and their being renamed to Guardian Druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... And yet you gave that to Disc...? Fistweaving should have been 100% of the focus. They are martial arts healers, Asian medicine deals a lot with acupuncture, massage, and a lot of physical medicinal methods through Chi flow. Blizzard says they are looking at the &quot;fantasy&quot; of the characters but this is turning away from the fantasy of a Mistweaver completely! Instead of trying to balance it they give up and says its &quot;awkward&quot; while giving disc that play style of attacking to heal.<br />
<br />
I don't play a monk and have no interest in the class, but seeing stuff like this, the Dalaran sewers Rogue hall, and a lot of what Blizzard does lately makes it hard to keep faith in them :T</div></div><hr />

Yup, seems like they are removing all that made Mistweavers so unique. Now they will be a random healer class.</div></div><hr />

Mistweaver looks okay... wasn't a fan before, probably still won't consider playing. Soothing Mist passive won't work out. Sounds easy to use, but I don't want to stand there doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Poor Windwalker. No major changes, just forces you to Jab&gt;Finisher instead of Jab&gt;Jab&gt;Finisher&gt;Finisher, etc.<br />
<br />
Typos are not a big deal, but hard to imagine these don't get an editing pass before they are published. Kind of unimpressive for something so many are expected to read.</div></div><hr />

All of our uniqueness has been removed, and interesting and fun parts of the spec removed. How exactly are we supposed to be happy about this?<br />

<br />
The issue with the mistweaving is that we all loved the active channeling around soothing mists and other skills interacting with that. I personally liked the set up of it all, minus the renewing mists-uplift combo, and I am glad we got better AoE spells for that now. It's not the spells...it's the changing of the style. Now we're practically just resto druids rather than mist weaving monks...I'll have to see how that new soothing mists passive plays out. It just doesn't feel...right...<br />
<br />
There's a reason why I abandoned maining a resto shaman for a MW monk -- the MW monk was fun and exciting for me because of the whole soothing mists mechanics that interacted and played so well with each other. And I loved channeling healing spells -- that made the spec more unique compared to the other &quot;stand and cast&quot; healers.</div></div><hr />

what you are saying is irrelevant. I know what I enjoyed about the class, and it has been removed. I know enough to be bummed. I could give 2 shits about how it plays with these changes when I know what I liked about the class has been gutted. Will I enjoy some of the new changes?

Exactly this, I even forgot about the artifact abilites. I feel like they're going for a very basic and limited amount of &quot; basic core &quot; abilites. And adding alot more from talents and the artifact IF you wan't. Instead of making you have an absurd amount of basic abilites to start with you can increase how many there are and if you don't wan't more you can decide to go with passives instead. I think this is a great change and will make it so you can play the class the way you wan't. Thus making the previews seem lackluster but in reality the diversity now comes from talents and artifact as it should be. Making it easier for newer players and harder for veterans if you wan't.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone is saying they know how it plays -- but how it sounds. It's removing a lot of the core mechanics that they claim they wanted to emphasize. Have you looked at the other Previews? Almost all of the wording is exactly the same with the same things being stripped. It looks so far like they are saying they are taking the core identities and strengthening them, but they aren't -- they're stripping them down and making all of the classes very similar to each other while taking away things that made the classes unique. At the same time, they are previewing the &quot;CORE&quot; class abilities -- yes there are other abilities, but these are the bread and butters of the class they are showing, and they can be enhanced in different ways and numbers can make things work, but that doesn't make it fun.<br />
<br />
But yes, we are basing our opinions on nothing. The problem with this mistweaver one though isn't like Resto Shaman -- where they didn't do anything but some QOL, but the fact that they took some core spells away and replaced them with generic versions -- because they 'work better.'</div></div><hr />

Honestly, mistweaver monk might have been fun once you figured out what to do, but it was not intuitive at all. I got stomped in dungeons trying to level as a mistweaver and decided to try a different class. I understand why blizz is making this change. Monk is one of the least played classes in the game. Disc Priest is a better class/spec for this type of gameplay, in my honest opinion, because you already know it's going to be &quot;non-standard.&quot; There's already a dps and a healing spec for priest so disc falls somewhere in the middle.

I am kinda happy on some things with MW, like the ability to heal without a setup, mainly for 5 mans but why no uplift? I mean why? lol As for WW, the way tiger power seems to work, it'll take the place of jab, so we now hit TP then another ability and then tp and another? Sounds slow and I liked WW in MoP because of the speed. No combo points on MW sucks along with no fistweaving. Which is strange because they said healers should be able to do solo content without issue, yet they seem to have taken all our damaging abilities. Its very confusing to me what they are doing. As for disc getting the ability to dps and heal, yeah I'll believe that when I see it. This makes the 2nd or 3rd time they have tried that with disc, it never worked. They tried the same concept with MW, and built the class from the ground up with doing damage and healing at the same time and scraped the entire idea in 2 xpacs, I don't see it working this time either.<br />
<br />
They do seem to be making everything more simple, which in some ways I understand, and this isn't just on monks but everything over the past couple of days seems to be making the rotations so easy you don't need to track anything. Just press the buttons in the right order and you win. Which imo kinda sucks.</div></div><hr />

A big part of my issue is the flavor is gone. If shuffle still exists, it is pretty core to went a Brewmaster ever bothered with blackout kick.<br />
<br />
What made Windwalker feel like a flow and not just &quot;click buttons&quot; was that rsk had a buff as well as the dmg, tiger palm also had a buff to manage, and bok was the basic dmg (plus dot) the way this looks is that bok/tp are merged as a single chi spender with no side effect. (Old jab now is named tiger palm). Hit buttons just to hit stuff because you can is boring, that should just be filter or finishers (old jab, and fists of fury)<br />

<br />
The way I read it the fundamental change is that you can opt when to change targets rather than having to wait for Chi to build up before changing targets. I don't think the mana recovery while channeling is comparable to Chi generation unless you are OOM and are eagerly waiting to be able to switch to what you need the resources to cast (be that resource Chi or mana). <br />
<br />
I think the change provides more freedom of choice, basically. <br />
<br />
As for the loss of fistweaving, it was that mechanic that pretty much pushed me away from the class, I didn't like what felt like an additional mechanic imposed un-necessarily. I also really don't like being in melee and in my raid team at least, our tanks don't like having people in melee that really don't need to be there. I'm curious what the people who like fistweaving and are sad to see it going away like about the mechanic (not to criticise, simply curious).</div></div><hr />

Random targeting has always been a problem in this game. Even in Warlords magma totems were an unecessary risk to use because they'd target anything in range despite it being in combat. For this to work their needs to be some form of intelligence tied to the target selection of the toggle. Whether it be recently attacked enemies, anything in combat with you, anything that's not CC'd or not aggro'd yet. For the Storm, Earth, Fire change to work it needs this or it will not only loose the strength in controlling what targets to focus but also its current benefit to 2 target cleave. Please give it a targeting algorithm that isnt 100% random</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Halios</div><div class="date">2015-11-11, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a little grossed out by the Windwalker changes, more specifically the implementation of the mastery, and the talent Hit Combo. I think naive players are looking at this and thinking, well, to quote Blizz: &quot;Combo Strikes, encourages mixing a variety of abilities, which provides a constant gameplay hook that influences every ability they use and draws inspiration from classic fighting games.&quot;<br />
<br />
Except I don't see a hook in essentially forcing a rotation in order to benefit from mastery AT ALL, and a relatively constrained one at that. To give you an example:<br />
<br />
This assumes approximately 1.5 second long global cooldowns, and basically infinite energy (which you'd better hope for, considering the alternative, which I'll cover below):<br />
<br />
Start time 0:00 <br />
Tiger Palm -0:00 + 2 chi -&gt; current chi: 2<br />
Rising Sun Kick -0:015 - 2 chi -&gt; current chi: 0<br />
Tiger Palm - 0:03 +2 chi -&gt; current chi: 2<br />
Blackout Kick - 0:045 -1 chi -&gt; current chi: 1<br />
Tiger Palm - 0:06 +2 chi -&gt; current chi: 3<br />
Fists of Fury - 0:075 -3 chi -&gt; current chi: 0<br />
Tiger Palm - 0:115 +2 chi -&gt; current chi: 2<br />
Rising Sun Kick - 0:13 -2 chi -&gt; current chi: 0<br />
Tiger Palm - 0:145 +2 chi -&gt; current chi: 2<br />
Blackout Kick - 0:16 -1 chi -&gt; current chi: 1<br />
Tiger Palm - 0:175 +2 chi -&gt; current chi: 3<br />
Blackout Kick - 0:19 -1 chi -&gt; current chi: 2<br />
Etc, this repeats until RSK is up, or FoF is up.<br />
<br />
Basically, your rotation, in order to gain the mastery bonus, and to keep the talent buff up, requires that you A: never perform a Chi Dump unless it uses RSK FoF(or vice versa), or BK FoF (or RSK) BK (which are the only ways you would expend 4-5 Chi without repeating an ability), and B: interweave Tiger Palm and BK as every other ability you use in your regular rotation. The 8 second cooldown on RSK and the 20 second cooldown on FoF mean that the only 2 abilities you have up consistently are one that costs 50 energy and generates 2 chi, and one that expends 1 chi. This means you have two options: Either wait for 50 energy before every hit to maintain combo damage, which will result in Monks most likely being energy starved by default (since they'll ALWAYS need energy to continue their optimal rotation), or use Blackout kick twice in a row, losing your talent buff and not benefiting from mastery.<br />
<br />
My main beef with this system is that it doesn't really change Windwalker gameplay or make it interesting, it really just constricts which abilities you're ALLOWED to use at any given time and get ideal results. You CAN'T use 2 blackout kicks in a row without being punished. You CAN'T use two Tiger Palms to build up chi for a strong burst without losing some% of your damage. <br />
<br />
I think people who don't understand rotations are looking at the word &quot;Combo&quot; and getting excited. But I can almost guarantee this: You will not be doing combos. You will be doing a constrained rotation for maximum damage output, that will have almost NO flexibility in how it can be executed. You simply don't have enough CD-less abilities to have any real &quot;combos&quot;.</div></div><hr />

One of my favorite times of playing WoW was wrath feral with Omen of Clarity. I loved how adapting your rotation to the proc was rewarding. I wish they could do something with WW to encourage that. But once again, they want the skill floor to be low, so the effectiveness of the new passive has to be weak :/.<br />
<br />
My favorite part of MW was how powerful it was when fist weaving. I'd jump into Heroic dungeons and heal solely through fistweaving and the occasional bubble. I don't understand why they felt the need to remove that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kinda thought the exact same thing when I first looked at it. But when you think about it you will ALWAYS be getting the mastery bonus on your important abilities because they have cooldowns. Even for casual players who ignore the mastery completely and just hit buttons, they'll still be getting the bonuses on all abilities the majority of the time. And missing out on tiger palm combos I would guess is irrelevant as it will likely a minor damaging ability.<br />
<br />
But we still have talents to take into consideration. They are supposedly giving players throughput options in many talent tiers including both passive and active abilities. This combo system alone could be enough of a reason to make the active abilities more appealing by giving you more abilities to weave in between blackout kicks and tiger palms.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of amazing how these forums seem to be full of people who can envision exactly how a class is played in content they haven't seen judging by ~50% of the abilities they will have. <br />
Sorry, I get it that we're all grasping at straws trying to understand the overhauls and decide if we like it or not. I was curious about the mistweaver since that's what I mainly play on my monk and while the changes seem a little odd, I will have to try it out before I make up my mind. Remember, not only will we have more talents that directly affect gameplay but the artifact will also add stuff.<br />

RIP soothing mists/channeled healing.<br />
<br />
I really don't like the way it seems MW will be working in Legion. It looks like every other healer except you have a passive channel after every heal. Seems really boring to me. And the class is only 2 expansions old, it hasn't been messed with as much as the other ones that need to be reigned in and redefined. All they really needed to do was fix the mastery and make RM go to the lowest health player. They could have also fixed it to spread to the lowest timer for smaller groups.<br />
<br />
Will have to wait and see because I really liked the active channeling broken up with quick aoe heals. As far as fistweaving, I can understand why they removed it (because they don't want to give you a choice on how to play your class just like how they defined the DK specs) but I never used it except for questing so it doesn't really affect me.</div></div><hr />

Based on what I saw during blizzcon our weapons will have 2-3 active abilities also that we will be using and ofc the 7 tiers of talents (even if you only get 2-3 active from them).<br />
I do concede your point that even with talents and weapon abilities the rotation will be very fixed, close to being /castsequence worthy.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just checked some images with regards to Artifact weapons and from the 3 weapons i could find with talent trees it seems each weapon will have 4 gold abilities (think those are all active abilities, mind you not 100% sure)</div></div><hr />

They can't even get the name OR the class right... The incompetence is staggering...<br />

Down the bottom.. <br />
&quot;We hope you’ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Monk class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We’ll continue our series later today with a look at Monks.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, what drew me to mistweaver was how unique its abilities were to other healing classes.<br />
<br />
-I loved the channeling effect of soothing mists, and the animation with it.<br />
-I loved my jade statue that would be with me.<br />
-Using chi as a resource.<br />
-Mana tea as a ways to slowly replenish mana.<br />
<br />
ALL of that is gone now. They completely changed the spec, and instead of making it &quot;unique&quot; they made it much more like any other healing class. This makes me very sad, and for the time being makes me consider shelving this character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brew Master, sounds Ok, not too sure how I like Blackout and breath of fire sharing a 3 SEC CD, seems a bit much. Though having no chi and using charges will make for a much more smoother and reactive gameplay style.<br />
<br />
Mistweaver sounds like it could be fun, removal of Chi was a good step. Slightly disappointed with the removal of Fist weaving and their reasoning, since I would think healing through Damage would fit a Monk healer much more than Discipline Priests.<br />
<br />
Overall: May very well go back to my Monk for legion now since Ret seems to be Mehh.<br />

What changes? Dumbing down SEF and adding a mastery to change our rotation? Your easy to impress.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down? lolwut, SEF was never hard, it was just extremely clunky. I would say the new mastery is making it &quot;more&quot; hard than the current WW which is Jab BoK Jab RSK Jab FoF Bok Bok Bok Bok repeat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc4deeda2d3c</div><div class="date">2015-11-12, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree that Brewmaster will maybe boring in Legion. So basically, you hitting the skill you can use, while you have very little control over what you are doing (only the 2 brew give you choice). Just pressing skills on cd. <br />
<br />
Currently its very fun and challenging to play brewmaster, you have to carefully decide when to guard (and save chi for it), when to use elusive brew and when to &quot;waste&quot; chi for purify...not to mention you have to care about shuffle all the time. Where all this going? (well we dont know nothing about shuffle)<br />
<br />
Just a simple spam rotation. We dont know the other abilities, but these core skills seems very repetitive and unintresting.<br />
<br />
(somebody mentioned, brewmasters should use a drunk meter as a resource, which you would need to use for stuffs, but care to not reach the max of it...now that would be fun! :) )<br />
<br />
And btw, it seems they dont want us to kick, as blackout is now a weapon hit (which i like very much to fight with my staff) - BUT then why we have tiger palm? Why not do some different techniques only with the staff (like Chen in the MoP intro). Its silly to put back the staff on my back for a tiger palm hit, then take it off again.<br />
<br />
And for all the &quot;monk fantasy&quot; - main part of it would be the statues. They make MW statue a talent (which maybe you wont ever choose over an other talent), and WW wont get any. (and we can just hope they leave BM statue as it is now)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc14a888ba76</div><div class="date">2015-11-12, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poor Windwalker. No major changes, just forces you to Jab&gt;Finisher instead of Jab&gt;Jab&gt;Finisher&gt;Finisher, etc.<br />
<br />
Like this I would wish there were no changes. Where is the buff/debuff that were central to the rotation? Where are any new ideas to keep it fast-paced and fun in the absence of these? This is just staring into the empty void of the minds of today's class developers. Not to mention I already got a strong suspicion that the crazy amazing future talents people will tell us to wait for will be nothing but a rush job for most specs: passives, the odd long CD dps increase with a &quot;super cool&quot; gimmicky idea behind it, revived glyphs or former side-effects (this talent adds a stun to FoF!) and abilities shuffled around between classes so they look less recycled (I don't see why they wouldn't mention them if they had something interesting in store, which &quot;close to beta&quot; they should by now).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alpha14</div><div class="date">2015-11-12, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What bothers me the most is the new WW's mastery, it is a nerf and a restriction in gameplay, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
The 25% increase in damage is not a bonus, all the abilities will be tuned down so that coupled with mastery they do the same damage they would have without. <br />
<br />
This leaves us with nothing more than a punishing 25% decrease in damage if we don't use 2 different abilities in a row, which is nothing more than a gameplay restriction.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for MW, they are removing most of the things I like about the spec. The actual gameplay is unique and dynamic (not as much as in mop though). Channeling soothing mist as an active ability in order to get instant heals is interesting and involving, at least for me. <br />
<br />
Also chi is great as it makes MW different from other healers by adding an additional resource that allows to cast heals, after accumulating chi, without using mana which feels satisfying and I think blizz is missing an opportunity to emphasize on this mechanic in Legion. Lastly the change to soothing mist means that MW will have to sacrifice some mobility to make the most of their heals while their actual mobility is was what set them apart from other healers. <br />
<br />
In short, they are removing everything that makes MW unique. Hope they will come back on their decisions.</div></div><hr />

That is a horrible solution. Was that an intern idea? ITS TERRIBLE.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exquis</div><div class="date">2015-11-12, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure why everyone is bashing the MW changes so hard, i for one am pleased with most of them.<br />
<br />
New mastery? fucking finally.<br />
Less RNG? Yes thank you<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure how to feel about the removal of chi, it was fun and original to play with. But i'd rather have it work more like holy paladins did where it was more of a &quot;free bonus&quot; to throw out. Not have 90% of your healing based around it. I always felt restricted by it, VERY restricted. &quot;Oh ran out of chi and there's a shit ton of aoe damage on the raid, better spend 4 globals on surging mist since i have no REM charges, just so i can aoe heal.&quot; However removing it entirely feels like a major backfire. <br />
<br />
If mana tea is gone i'll be very happy. The &quot;Have more manacost cause you can spend time channeling to regen mana&quot; never appealed to me. <br />
<br />
But idk, removal of uplift upsets me. I loved the relationship between ReM and uplift, but it felt kind of shit when they fucked up the smart jumping on it. Having it bounce to people with 99% health for 100% overheal uplift was always extremely annoying. I do have to say i enjoy the new ReM though. <br />
<br />
I really do wish they would've fixed fistweaving instead of removing it though, saddens me greatly. If they made fistweaving what they gave disc now it would be so amazing. But, meh, blizz lazy. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall im happy though, pretty sure i'll keep playing MW in legion. Either that or holy priest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, we are too shallow now. We don't have depth now...<br />
OK, so who made the change that took stagger off shuffle and make us &quot;easier&quot; to play?! Now, tell us about depth...</div></div><hr />

Anyone who likes the change from chi to mana is a shitter who can't play a monk and needs to go back to a paladin.</div></div><hr />
