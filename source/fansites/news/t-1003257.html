<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc6cf872d270</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The announced expansion looks more like an expansion for kids making WoW even more a game for children with pandas, pet battles and so on in my opinion. PvE battlegrounds? Really? We need more real PvP in this game and not less. The dumbing down also continues with achievement sharing among your chars, automatic talents and now even resilience as a base stat. What a hell?<br />
<br />
We know by know how it's going to work out too. At first they won't allow flying until max level, then a month or so after release they will change that and pretty soon you will be able to fly at all levels. The new race will start at 70 or so because there will be massive whining about having to level again etc. More whining will also lead to all races having speed leveling and racials will get nerfed again. Another melee class, oh gee, just what this game needed, oh and another tank class, I'm sooooo excited……….cough, cough. Has Blizzard not learned yet that it doesn't matter how many tank classes they introduce in the game, people will still prefer dps over tanking. Now, if they were brave they would have introduced a new ranged class instead but I guess the kids prefer melee like they always do and Blizzard always goes after the money and the whiners.<br />
<br />
There was a time I wasn't this pessimistic about the game but after nearly 6 years and witnessing the debacle that was cataclysm and countless other disappointments I'm quite sure this is what's going to happen. I know a lot can change put it probably won't.We'll see wont we?</div></div><hr />

The original warcraft was not like that. Up until wotlk they managed to maintain that specific vibe. I'm sick of them trying to recreate archetypal real world places inside the game. Scandinavia, Egypt and now China. Screw that. Give me the real Azeroth, like it was in W3</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleredar</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many people have noted the &quot;kung-fu panda&quot; style... in fact, it's almost as if Kung-Fu Panda and the Mists of pandaria had some sort of common thematic base... as if their was some sort of mystical continent or area with an ancient culture in real life that they both drew from, and from which Pandas originally came... Could such a place possibly exist?<br />
<br />
Sarcasm aside, I'm highly doubtful that Blizzard &quot;jacked&quot; the concept of Kung-Fu Panda... as was pointed out, pandaren (which already had a fair degree of martial arts prowess) were around a good deal before Kung-Fu Panda was released. Furthermore, I'd place a fair wager that Blizzard was already working on Mists of Pandaria IN 2008, when Kung-Fu Panda was released. What do you think they should have done? Scrap the entire expansion?<br />
<br />
Now, my only real disappointment so far is that they haven't had any mention of the Naga, Queen Azshara, or N'zoth... Honestly, I think honing in on a specific villain is the best way to go, as it gives a story more rooted in established Lore, which will ultimately give them firmer ground to build off of. I mean, it wouldn't even be that much of a stretch to incorporate them... I'm assuming Pandaria is located around the Maelstrom, where the Naga have taken a shine to hanging out. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is the first day of Blizzcon, and nothing says that they couldn't introduce these as the expansion progresses.</div></div><hr />

If you decide to give a random WoW player $1000, he's not going to say &quot;Thank you&quot;, he's going to say &quot;omg why u so cheap? give 2k or gtfo greedy..&quot; etc. Personally I love the new zones, and the fact that they're adding more things to do is also good. And by the way; Pandaren have existed long before Kung Fu Panda, so you should whine about the movie and not the race. But honestly, I think it's for the best that people leave the game, I liked it better when the game was still &quot;small&quot;.</div></div><hr />

P.S. personal opinion, you dont have to agree with me nor do i have to agree with you. so take it as you will.</div></div><hr />

You don't know your history.<br />
The pandaren were an April Fools joke (twice) and never were implemented in game outside of a pet in last expansion.<br />

Chen Stormstout was a playable pandaren character in warcraft 3 who helped out rexxar. Pandarens have also been mentioned constantly in vanilla WoW within the barrens and stormwind.</div></div><hr />

This is a long, long way to go for a joke - lots of time during the first day of Blizzcon, a new trailer that must have cost quite a bit to make, screenshots, media coverage, customer reaction. And then they're going to walk this back as a joke? Hard to believe Vivendi shareholders would be OK with Blizzard executives putting their share prices at risk for a few laughs.<br />
<br />
So it's probably for real, and Blizzard has decided to aim for the pre-teen and Chinese markets. Hello Kitty Adventure Island must be where the money is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleredar</div><div class="date">2011-10-22, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you played Wotlk with a &quot;viking themed&quot; mmo exp, what's the difference?<br />
<br />
I don't strictly agree with the standpoint of the person you quoted, but I think I can better articulate his (and people that share a similar viewpoint's) argument<br />
<br />
Wotlk wasn't really 100% &quot;viking themed...&quot; obviously, we had the Vrykul, but they weren't the main focus of the expansion, nor was their architecture. Now, personally, I flipping love everything Nordic, but blizzard made a good move, as Northrend was much more... diverse... in its themes, both architectural and landscape-wise. We had the Taunka and Tuskarr, who's culture was based (loosely) on that of the Inuits/Native Americans, the Nordic-Inspired vrykul, the trippy, almost sci-fi blue dragonflight, the ancient, frost bound meso-american kingdom of the drakkari, the fanciful hanging Nerubian buildings, the steampunk-infused roman halls of the titans, and the stark, LotR-esque architecture of the scourge's most formidable battlements. And while all of these themes have numerous influences undoubtedly rooted in the real world, each one nonetheless had its own unique, distinguishing stylistic flare that truly tied them to their respective races and clearly established them as their own unique culture. Just because it was brought up, the Vrykul, for example, had their sharp, perching harpoon nests dotting the cliffsides and their (quite original) stone fortresses that separated them quite clearly from real life vikings.<br />
<br />
Now, I'll be the first to admit that Pandaria is definitely one of the most beautiful environments in all of WoW. But the problem is... the Chinese architecture doesn't feel exclusively &quot;Pandaren.&quot; And this isn't necessarily Blizzard's &quot;fault,&quot; nor is it due to &quot;laziness&quot; on their part (I think I could safely say that the architecture of the Pandaren took a HELL of a lot of work.) Chinese architecture is already very fanciful and stylized. As creative as blizzard is, it's understandable that the threshold couldn't be pushed that much further without making it look completely cartoony. Moreover, this is the central theme of an expansion that already (well, it's only been a day) feels excluded from Warcraft's general &quot;grand design&quot; in terms of lore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Titoselfire</div><div class="date">2011-10-22, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many people have noted the &quot;kung-fu panda&quot; style... in fact, it's almost as if Kung-Fu Panda and the Mists of pandaria had some sort of common thematic base... as if their was some sort of mystical continent or area with an ancient culture in real life that they both drew from, and from which Pandas originally came... Could such a place possibly exist?<br />
<br />
Sarcasm aside, I'm highly doubtful that Blizzard &quot;jacked&quot; the concept of Kung-Fu Panda... as was pointed out, pandaren (which already had a fair degree of martial arts prowess) were around a good deal before Kung-Fu Panda was released. Furthermore, I'd place a fair wager that Blizzard was already working on Mists of Pandaria IN 2008, when Kung-Fu Panda was released. What do you think they should have done? Scrap the entire expansion?<br />
<br />
Now, my only real disappointment so far is that they haven't had any mention of the Naga, Queen Azshara, or N'zoth... Honestly, I think honing in on a specific villain is the best way to go, as it gives a story more rooted in established Lore, which will ultimately give them firmer ground to build off of. I mean, it wouldn't even be that much of a stretch to incorporate them... I'm assuming Pandaria is located around the Maelstrom, where the Naga have taken a shine to hanging out. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is the first day of Blizzcon, and nothing says that they couldn't introduce these as the expansion progresses.<br />
<br />
no need to rip it from Kung Fu Panda, everything else is already ripped off from Guild wars Factions and announced features for Guild Wars 2, blizzard just put panda's in it to make it like they invented it. lol</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt be suprised if they cancel the entire Expansion and bring something else. If they dont, thats pretty much economic suicide which even the annual pass wont prevent. I mean, they cancel Path of the Titans cause it wasnt fun, but they try to spoon-feed this to the playerbase?</div></div><hr />

Well done sir, it takes a special kind of someone to be both online and totally unable to use Google, or even the same source they used to show their ignorance<br />
