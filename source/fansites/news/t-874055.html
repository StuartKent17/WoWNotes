We have a fix currently in the testing stages but it will require realm restarts to apply. We’re currently anticipating rolling restarts to happen early tomorrow morning during off-peak hours. We apologize for any inconvenience for those attempting bosses tonight with these mechanics.<br />

Guild Challenges Information<br />
Zarhym wrote a couple of blue posts about Guild Challenges, it's not really a preview yet but at least we know where it's going now. <br />
We haven't shared much information about this feature because it's remained very much in development. That said, we're about ready to release Guild Challenges for testing on the PTR soon. We'll also be sharing more information on how Guild Challenges work in the near future. <br />
<br />
[...] What about if Guild Challenges gave experience above the cap, functioning like rested experience and moving the cap further relative to the experience gained through completing said challenges? :)<br />
<br />
Don't worry. I can read, I swear. I'm referring to experience and not rep. <br />
<br />
Ok now you're just tormenting us Zar. How about a one-sentence teaser about what guild challenges actually are? :)<br />
Built into the user interface, Guild Challenges will be separated into three categories: Guild Dungeon Run, Guild Raid, and Guild Rated Battleground. You just need to be in a guild group to complete each category a set number of times per week, earning your guild achievements, experience above the cap, and gold deposited into the Guild Vault (a lot more gold if the guild is level capped). We'll have more details for you probably by next week.<br />
<br />
Are these challenges only going to be able to be completed at level 85? It would be nice to see some love for low-level members in the guilds!<br />
As I understand it, you'll be eligible to contribute equally to things like the Guild Dungeon Run challenge, provided the dungeon you're running is level-appropriate for the guild group. <br />
<br />
That's pretty disappointing. Isn't this what guilds are already doing anyway? I thought it would be more like guild quests that create a phased challenge somewhere in the world for your guild to complete. This just promotes even more LFG queueing while sitting in town. Some love for world zones in endgame please.<br />
We're working on something sort of along these lines as a much more robust content feature for the future, but I can't put a date or patch number on that yet. It also won't necessarily be centered around guilds.<br />
<br />
Was that ambiguous? I've never been ambiguous before, so I wouldn't know. <br />

The Daily Blink - Mages Get A Slight Buff in 4.1<br />

I think this joke more the reaction ppl had when they saw frostbolt buff then joking about devs buffs mages.<br />
The general people reaction for 2 litle buffs was like they probably should did if this blink was real.<br />

Well, I'm allmost tempted to assume you're playing a mage...<br />
<br />
Cause only people that play the class in question are usually blind to their own overpoweredness.<br />
Sure, mages could use some love on the PVE side of things, but they're allready so insanly OP in battlegrounds it's sad to watch. You can see mages in BGs controlling 3-5 people easilly.<br />
And dont give me that crap about diminishing returns and shit, those slowing effects and the freezing. Yeah, it's not even close to funny anymore...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just thought I'd share this one:<br />

Mages are still not as good as people like you believe. Good players can pretty easily handle them in arena or rated bg. Don't even include normal battlegrounds, seriously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can a human being think &quot;Shamans who are detected looking directly at an arcane mage will now explode, dealing 50% of their former life to allies within 10 yards&quot; and the others are Real? Seriously? (Not to mention Huge -unnecessary- Warnings: &quot;This is a Joke, Not Official Changes&quot;) Are we really playing this game with those people?

Also, Atramedes was absolutely horrible yesterday, DBM telling you that he fixates on someone, and then he just goes for someone that is just not prepared for it (me in this case) and gets killed :( FU Atramedes, at least give me some new shoulders...</div></div><hr />
