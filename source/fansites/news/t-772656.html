Hmm i think blizzard might have made a tooltip error becuase it was already 2% hp every 1 seconds in past and ptr builds. It could be 2% every .5 seconds whoch would get you 3 procs like the current but that just seems alittle op 40% of your hp from 10 secs non stop draining when you have 100k+ hp *straches head* yea this is confusing.</div></div><hr />

This would make locks more drain happy than in bc.Someone who has never played a warlock apparently. It's been at 2% for a few weeks, they've been steadily nerfing everything remotely interesting aff locks had at the start of beta.<br />
<br />
Anyways that looks like they're playing with the soulburn version. Most likely nerfing it so that soulburn-DL doesn't give a fast 6% health.<br />
Affliction, considering the spec is supposed to built on self-healing, actually has far less survivability than a demo lock.<br />
<br />
Siphon life does a grand 1% per 3 seconds.(0.33% per second.)<br />
Haunt does about 3k every 8 seconds(or about 1.25% per second.)<br />
Fel armor does a grand 2% every 5 seconds. or 0.4% per second.<br />
Drain life does 2% per second.<br />
So you say that an interrupt/silence vulnerable healing of 4% per second is OP? At 80 4% of your health is a laughable 1200 health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where on earth is the nature bonus???<br />
<br />
as far as i understand it, the glyph will be multiplicative to enhance's mastery, since enhance's mastery increases nature, fire, and frost damage depending on how much mastery you have. and besides, our highest damaging spells as enhance will still be nature damage anyways, so i think the glyph makes sense.<br />
<br />
so in short, they added the old effect on to the new SS through glyph.</div></div><hr />

Look at the old model. Ok, look ar it closely. Now look at the new one. STFU and go play another race, momma's boys. <br />
<br />
The new model is AWESOME.<br />
<br />
The old one only looked bad because the model and textures were outdated (low polygon count, low texture resolution, etc), but the shape was just the best tree of life form shape possible. They should have remade that exact model with more polygons, better textures and more leaves.<br />
<br />
This new tree of life form looks more like a tree of I'm going to stomp you in the face form. Really... do you see that thing healing!?<br />

damn that sounds an awful lot like 'pet-shop'-pets... :(<br />

also:<br />
<br />
Mastery: Divine Bulwark now increases your chance to block melee attacks by 24%, up from 16%. Each point of Mastery increases block chance by an additional 3%, up from 2%.<br />
~15 Mastery to have 70% block, which should at least be nearly un-hitable.<br />

Wrong - Those are different colors similar to the different colored skins, Has nothing to do with the race.<br />
You change your troll's skin color / hair color / features = you'll get a different colored ToL.<br />

Word. Many of the dislikers are just jelous. The new tree of life looks better in ANY way. I hope the model is big, as tree of life should be. It's a 31 talented cooldown. It should stand out and look big and scary. Cant wait for the patch to hit beta.</div></div><hr />

1. The former aren't necessarily also the latter (ie. other people might complain about model re-using than those who complain that this one is ugly).<br />

2. I don't like it when they re-use models. I would really like it if they make new models. Just not these really ugly and stupid models.

You make a fair point, though obviously a subjective one. I've taken quite a shine to these new models, though - the old elemental one is practically the same (if not THE same) as ones used everywhere from Eversong Woods upwards. It's nice to see (at least in my eyes, which aren't what they once were) that the Resto druids seem to have a little bit of oomph behind them now. <br />
<br />
It was all very well turning into a mighty bear/ferocious cat/strange giant owl thingy, but then you got ToL and -to me- I couldn't help thinking &quot;Oh. It's a sentient twiglet.&quot; This one, in my view, certainly looks more like you're tapping into some primal natural forces when you use it.<br />
<br />
And as for the view that it looks too masculine (which I know you didn't bring up, I'm just trying to keep my rambling old thoughts in one post)... I wasn't aware that plantlife even HAD genders!</div></div><hr />

Minor point... plus it could be deliberate... but phrases like are on par with all the 'could care less' crap going around.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think it's correct how it is to be honest (agree with you on the &quot;could care less&quot; part though)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you really don't get it: 'you WOULD look' is essential. Read 'It's Always in the Last Place You Look' to yourself and tell me that this isn't nearly always the case and that you don't stop looking for something once you've found it.<br />
<br />
That's the joke, of course it's in the last place you look, you'd be an idiot to carry on looking after you found it :)</div></div><hr />

And ppl saying they made a new model... they didnt, reuse from WC3.<br />
<br />
I like it!<br />
<br />
1) Tree of Life in WC3 is a building. Tree of Life in WoW is a form.<br />
2) They have similarities, but they are drastically different<br />
3) I say this again, ToL in WC3 was a BUILDING.<br />

I fully support Deathwing randomly killing people at random times in any random zone. I think he should descend on the capitals occasionally and just roast people for a few minutes every other day. Not enough to be problematic but enough to keep you on the edge a bit. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Try playing in Windows mode maybe( maybe it'll let you close it) .I know last night I let it sit at the load screen for 10 mins and it let me in(not sure on exact time I went and made a snack).I apologize for being a douche in my previous post I'm used to all the mouth breathers last night being stupid.If it's the same issue you were having in the PTR deleting the Cache folder in the data folder helped me when I had that problem.</div></div><hr />

Tree of Life was considered a building in WCIII only for game mechanics, because they trained units and researched technologies. You could even uproot them, move them or even attack with them. All ancients are living creatures. You see Ancients of War, Ancients of Lore and Ancient Protectors in WoW. Do you consider them as buildings? Uprooted Trees of Life looked more like the new form than our old twiggy treant form.<br />

The new tree forms, while glossy, are disturbing at best and hideous at worst. Who had the brainstorm of crossing a goblin(-ish) head with a Chia Pet? Please excuse me while the designer in me silently weeps.<br />
<br />
Okay, now here is the constructive criticism. I approve of plentiful, shiny leaves. I think it is overboard in its current state. Also, why the hunchback appearance? The previous model (pre-4.0.1) had excellent posture. The overly-bushy top in combination of the low-slung head and drawn-out face absolutely breaks whatever flow the model had before.<br />
<br />
Please put the head back where heads ostensibly always go - at the top. Some judicious use of pruning shears would not go amiss, either.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that 99% of the time you are in your regular Night Elf/Tauren/Worgen/Troll form right? Now, if you think your character is normally uglier than either the new or old tree, I'm not sure what anyone can do to help that. :)<br />
<br />
For me it's all kind of meh. Why update the model when it's no longer a permanent form? I would've felt it was much more special if it was introduced when the bears and cat were introduced. At least to give us the time to get to see it more than once every 3 minutes.<br />

You are right, people are creating all this drama for nothing. ToL is now a 30 sec duration, 3 min cooldown talent and I love that they changed it, so now you're gonna be this big ancient like tree for 30 sec where you're almost unstopable and that's how it should look like.<br />
Also, most of the people that find it ugly, don't really care how it looks, but they still post &quot;zomg fugly tree&quot; post just for the sake of it. Sad.<br />
<br />
Moonkin form should be removed. Besides couple of buffs, it doesn't really do anything new to the character and playgame. Having it's own model is completely unjustified. Especially when the model is... big fat chicken.</div></div><hr />

But poor female night elf, possibly worgen females toons have to look like that too?<br />
<br />
Fortunately its a cooldown and I would not have to stare at it long. I am thinkin that it better have some amazing animations to offset its tree of ancient meet Maynard from Doby Gillis looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To those complaining that it looks elvish or masculine or WHY DOESN'T MY PREFERRED RACE O' DRUID GET ITS OWN YOONEEK TREE BLIZZARD?, I simply say this:<br />
<br />
Elves were the first druids, then the Tauren. It makes sense that the ToL would have an elvish feel, especially given that it now more resembles the Ancients from WCIII. And also ... a tree is a tree is a tree is a fucking tree. The reason why bear/cat forms are different? Flavor. Savannah lions are more prevalent to Mulgore, panthers to Darnassus, tigers to the Echo Isles and ... cat dogs to the Gilneans, I dunno. A tree is a tree. Suuuure the ToL looks like something uprooted from Teldrassil or Ashenvale, but it's also the most easily recognizable and easiest to model and animate. What would a Tauren druid get? A towering pine tree or a stunted savannah wannabe-tree bush like an acacia. Gilneans would get a darky-dark-mcbroody pine as well. ...Trolls? A goddamn palm tree.<br />
<br />
Sticking a lion's mane on an existing cat frame is one thing. It still moves with the same skeleton framework. Go a head and design me a moving, articulated palm tree that doesn't look as goofy as the new ToL. Do it. I dare you.<br />
<br />
<br />
...the only thing I would add to new ToL are the lanterns and other doodad-thingers the Ancients have.</div></div><hr />

The whole Cataclysm expansion's art direction is just incoherent. They nuked one of the best looking models, the Good ol', cute, adorable, likeable Tree form and made it into a zero vector, nonchalance shitpile.<br />
<br />
The T11 sets are laughable. Warlocks are struck by lightning jesters, warriors look like morons, thieves glow in the dark, drakes got remade, a bit tooled up, then the camel got an already existing animation, etc. It's a shitpile, like they don't have the money to make a few good looking models and create like 20 new animations for those goddamn units. Blizzard is da mudabitch.<br />

<br />
They updated the form now that its a 3 minute cooldown, and moonkin, which is more outdated, still doesn't have a new model.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it'll be out this week but seriously, blizz has the worst timing.<br />
<br />
The main reason so many druids hated tree form was that it looked like broccoli, and they update it AFTER its on a 3 min cooldown.<br />

I'm really tired of seeing this over and over; yes, some trees have sexes in the way you are thinking (separate male and female trees), a good example would be Holly. If you don't believe me, look up the terms Dioecious, Androecious and Gynoecious.</div></div><hr />

Way too early on this post. The devs over at Blizz won't have it out for a day or two. I know you like to get info out ASAP, but this one jumped the proverbial gun and landed on the 15th. If you have an inside source, that's OK. But don't let the cat out of the bag until the devs tell you!</div></div><hr />

Some do, but why does that matter?<br />
<br />
<br />
IT HAS A BEARD... WTF CARES? <br />
Clearly a lot of people do. It shows the model as more masculine and one of the biggest positives in the current Tree of Life form is that it isn't particularly male or female so they could use it for both.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh you are a troll druid? Then you will be blue, maybe a Tauren? Then you will get another color shade. <br />
1 shade for each race is pathetic. Each race should get a different model for Bear Form, Cat Form, Travel Form, Moonkin Form, Flight Form, Swift Flight Form and Tree of Life Form with minor color differences depending on what the player chose for their character. They've already done this for 2 forms and there is no valid reason for every other form to not get the same treatment.</div></div><hr />

I welcome the Evagelism and masochism buff.<br />
Don't like the change on Mind spike, but it's obvious that they want us not to even consider using it in our normal rotation, with the threat reduce it's now a pure trash-spammer but useless for anything else.<br />
<br />
..and here I was hoping we would have a better rotation for bosses but it looks like we'll be back to same old rotation with a couple deaths and blasts thrown in. (boring)<br />
<br />
I really liked the (3 orb) double mind spike, mind blast combo. Changed it up a bit. Lets hope they come to their senses. Keep Mind Sear as our AOE, cut out Mind spike's aoe dmg and let us use it in our rotation.<br />

Not that I care about the new ToL form, since I don't have a druid and the troll one I plan on making in cata will not be resto, but what minor glyph? I just looked on WoWTal and the MMO-C glyph preview page, and I don't see it. Can you link it? Or did you just make it up?</div></div><hr />

The new Tree of life is nice, but I hate blizzard for having changed starsurge graphic once again...<br />
Btw they change a 30sec shapeshift, but no new graphic for Moonkin form and Wrath? <br />
C'mon blizz they have the same graphic model since 5 years...<br />
<br />
one last juicy thing: <br />
# Wrath now costs 9% of base mana, down from 14%. &lt;- lol really ?????? then free wrath for everyone <br />
Moonglow	Rank 3<br />
Reduces the Mana cost of your damage and healing spells by 9%.</div></div><hr />
