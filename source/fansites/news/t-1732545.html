Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
I spent an hour and a half in Ashran and got one box, a couple hundred honor, and zero conquest points. It sucked. A lot.<br />
Thanks for the feedback and for presenting it reasonably. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/570775057150009344))<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to feel about the Ashran change. When events appear my team is overrun instantly and we have to wait for the next.<br />
now that the queue times are under control, we may lower the player cap in Ashran. It would help the overwhelming force problem. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572074615851245568))<br />
won't use personal account to speak about wow issues...... Unless it's ashran or to promote pvp tournaments cause pvp is fine lol<br />
Yes I will continue to promote WoW and PvP through Twitter. No I won't discuss design issues. Thanks for catching me on that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572113805066412032))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Love the Garrison Jukebox, but I thought Portable Audiophone would work more like an iPod. I need a jukebox for the mine/town hall<br />
The idea of an in-game music player that picks from any available track is kind of a cool idea, right? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/570853046814515200))<br />
That would be amazing. I rarely mute the in game music, but I get super nostalgic to hear the old tracks now and then.<br />
The track that plays when you enter the imp area of molten core before the first boss is my jam. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/570854002478292992))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Has the hate really even that bad on your end? I know it's wow pvp but you seem more withdrawn on twitter regarding WoW.<br />
We decided to have all WoW discussions from and not our personal twitter accounts. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/571560399746834432))<br />

<br />
Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/ssdgraph.gif) are trending slightly downward again over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
New GPUs from AMD may be coming in the second half of this year, but no official announcements have been made. <br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

<br />
Would you rather he added smiley faces at the end of everything? No I'm pretty sure he's just a dick.. I mean the other guys don't come across as rude at all or at their worst sporadically, but Holinka often has this indignance to his posts which is more likely restricted than encouraged by the 140 char limit. Even here he's just completely oblivious as to how blindly obsessive he sounds with his pet project, practically stating that Ashran issues are WoW promotion, or what it sounds like when he admits that Twitter is just another propaganda tool for devs and fuck your issues. And then to cap it all he still has the chars to squeeze in an insincere &quot;thanks&quot; that really means &quot;Well duh!&quot;. Like he just shot himself in the crotch and is blowing away the smoke from his gunpoint smugly.<br />
<br />
In fact I suspect that his stupidity and inclination to get involved in Twitter drama is one of the reasons as to why the devs have been called back from that medium and are only allowed to spread officially condoned info as a collective.</div></div><hr />

Oh come on, are you gonna pretend that you don't know what WoW community is like? Have you ever tried reading a few threads around here? Opening any of the sub-forums is near enough to give you cancer just for reading the titles.<br />

Seriously, why even defend this number one twat in their communication department whose little, easily avoidable dramas seem to have majorly contributed to the ivory tower approach to communication we see from blizzard's developers today.

Forgive my arrogance, but do you have any source to back up your claim?<br />
<br />
Because from what i heard from our IT department, WD used to store their HDD firmware on disk itself instead of memory chip, which caused massive failure if bad sector appeared in firmware part. Thats why we ditched WD for a VERY long time.</div></div><hr />

I know right. He didn't even respond to that one user about how he spent an hour and a half in the place and got no conquest. At least say &quot;We're looking into addressing how conquest is earned in Ashran&quot;. I guess he won't because they don't care about how users feel about Ashran.</div></div><hr />

Would you rather he added smiley faces at the end of everything?<br />
<br />
No, his responses are completely passive aggressive. That level of dickishness comes across even on twitter. Seriously, can we get someone who actually cares about the player base to be in charge of pvp?<br />
<br />
Ashran has gone through so many different levels of shit...I've dropped the gladiator sanctum on almost all of my characters now because it takes an hour in queue as well as 1.5-3 hours in Ashran to get enough bones for a day or twos worth of work orders. At least in the battles I've been in there is very little battle. My horde faction runs up and down the middle doing the &quot;battle&quot; while the alliance faction runs around and does the objectives. Very rarely a real fight breaks out and most of the time I'm stuck getting occasional bones from the stray ally that passes through the mid. I went in for 3 hours yesterday, got ~200 bones and only 9 kills toward my quest, which is the human kill one... Would like to actually finish the quest for the title but I doubt that will happen at this rate. Even if I do there is next to know chance of getting any other titles than Manslayer. <br />
<br />
Things that would be nice:<br />
<br />
Short queues<br />
More ability to build up to gear (higher conquest from main objective? Chance of glad gear with every success?)<br />
Other incentives to actually pvp instead of have pve in a pvp zone (I could go to Nagrand for that)<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be cool to see an intermediate set of gear in pvp like ilevel640 that allows us to be in between the 600-620 gear and the 660 gear. That way if you are gearing an alt you don't get annihilated by the full glad geared players when you face them. I'm not asking for the ability to kill someone in 660 pvp gear with 640 gear but having a chance to escape would be nice.</div></div><hr />

There are only 15 iLvls between honor and conq gear, not 40. It doesnt feel like a large survivability gap either. No point to a middle set. Ashran events were/are a good source of slow steady conq points to upgrade the honor set. The recent changes to the Q have made it very fast, but the amount of people in each instance of it changed the dynamic. Zergs drag the frame rate into the crapper. Any imbalances get amplified until one side gets wiped. If they tone that back down without killing Q times, Ashran will be fine.</div></div><hr />
