Guide to the Golden Lotus Faction Quests<br />
We've seen some confusion about how to gain access to the Golden Lotus faction dailies in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. In case you've been having trouble getting where you need to be, below are some detailed steps to ensure you're on the correct path.<br />
<br />
Spoiler Warning! This guide shares some details about the associated quest chain that takes you to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and the Golden Lotus. If you'd prefer to naturally find your way there during your adventures, the first couple of bullets should be sufficient for pointing you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Here is how you get into the Vale of Eternal Blossoms:<br />
<br />
At level 87, go speak to Anduin (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64540-anduin-wrynn)/Dezco (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64542-sunwalker-dezco) at the Temple of the White Tiger in Kun-Lai Summit and complete “A Celestial Experience (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31395-a-celestial-experience).” Accept the follow-up quest, “A Witness to History (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31511-a-witness-to-history).”<br />
Find Anduin (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64848-anduin-wrynn)/Dezco (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64853-sunwalker-dezco) at the big gate north of the Vale. This will start a cinematic that opens the gates.<br />
Turn in “A Witness to History (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31511-a-witness-to-history)” to Zhi the Harmonious (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/59905-zhi-the-harmonious) at the Golden Pagoda in the center of Vale of Eternal Blossoms.<br />
Accept and complete the follow-up quest, “The Shrine of Two Moons (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30649-the-shrine-of-two-moons),” and “The Shrine of Seven Stars (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30631-the-shrine-of-seven-stars)” (Horde/Alliance respectively).<br />
If you're not level 90 you'll receive no further quests.<br />
At level 90 you should return and pick up the quest chain again. Note that you must have trained flying to proceed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pick up “The Ruins of Guo-Lai (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30632-the-ruins-of-guo-lai)” and complete it.<br />
This leads to “Out with the Scouts (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30633-out-with-the-scouts)” and “Barring Entry (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30634-barring-entry).” This leads to “Killing the Quilen (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30635-killing-the-quilen)” and “Stones of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30636-stones-of-power).” While in the ruins, you should also get “The Guo-Lai Halls (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30654-the-guo-lai-halls).” If you don't get this quest near the entrance to the crypt, you can return to Anji Autumnlight (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/58465-anji-autumnlight) to get this quest.<br />
These 3 quests must be completed before you can complete “Leaving an Opening (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30638-leaving-an-opening).” Turn in “Leaving an Opening” at the Golden Pagoda, and this should lead straight into the dailies.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or concerns, or if you're still experiencing issues accessing the Vale of Eternal Blossoms or the Golden Lotus daily quests, please let us know.<br />

No Pet Battle Quests<br />
If you're not seeing the daily quests for a continent, have you earned the Taming achievement to unlock them for that continent? Did they show up once and then never come back? (not resetting) Are any working at all, and if so, which ones?<br />
<br />
Note: Taming Kalimdor is Horde only, and Taming Eastern Kingdoms is Alliance only. This was done via hotfix so the UI in-game will not update until 5.1, which is why you may see completion swap between the two. Not to worry though, the data is all there and will be resolved with the 5.1 patch. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239417-no-pet-battle-quests/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794981151?page=1#14))<br />
<br />
Ink Trader Exchange Change<br />
Is there an answer for my question on whether it is a hotfix or a client patch?<br />
This is planned to go in as a hotfix. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239349-ink-trader-exchange-change/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794712085?page=2#38))<br />
<br />
Strong Pet Trap?<br />
We applied a hotfix to attempt to resolve issues of not properly receiving the upgraded Strong and Pristine traps. Please let us know if you're still having the issue, what character and realm is seeing the issue, and once you received the achievement, did your trap art, tooltip or icon change to reflect an upgraded trap? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239332-strong-pet-trap/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6713481971?page=3#51))<br />
<br />
New Loot Window<br />
you can type /loot to see who needs/greed/passes<br />
I've done a few dungeons myself during this weekend and I've noticed that some players are simply unaware of this feature, sometimes I saw some people needing on offspec stuff because they weren't seeing any &quot;need&quot; rolls from other players, obviously this can lead to some arguing.<br />
<br />
So here it is again for the sake of clarity, please type /loot, /lootrolls or you can just click on [Loot] in the chat window. <br />
This will open a new loot window that shows you all rolls on every item.<br />
You can also go to Interface-&gt;Controls-&gt; and click on “Auto Open Loot Rolls Window!” (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239290-new-loot-system-is-not-very-effective/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5575027577?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
Daily Quests and Gearing for Raids<br />
You can get gear from heroic dungeons and in the process get 60 Valor for the first dungeon you do daily, as well as 30 Valor for the first scenario and a chance at getting loot usable by your class when finishing it. It may seem a small amount, but since both venues can be done relatively quickly, if you're aiming to cap valor points, it'll probably be the fastest way to do so (without considering raiding).<br />
<br />
If there are particular items (read: gear) you feel you need to get 100% from the factions in Mists of Pandaria, keep in mind that Raid Finder gear is not available yet, and neither the Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring raids. <br />
<br />
If even with these things taken into consideration you still feel that a particular item is required, then it might be a good idea to point it out on this thread<br />
<br />
Assume for a minute that, the player is casual (read: not alot of time to spend in game but capable), and is able to cap valor points in a given week, yet doesn't have the time to rep grind from doing the ridiculous number of dailies that are currently the main end game focus of mists until we are allowed into all raids and RF is active etc etc, with a total cap of 3k VP available per character. How then is this type of player supposed to get gear? <br />
Sounds like a rather edgy case, meaning, if a player is as casual as you described, it'd probably be best for that player to focus on cap his valor through dailies, so that he'll be grinding whichever reputations he wants to focus on at the same time. If he chooses instead to focus on doing heroics until he gets his gear, then after he's done with that part, he might focus on dailies.<br />
<br />
The problem is, this case is littered with too many &quot;ifs&quot;. For this discussion it'd probably be much more useful to know what's exactly concerning you.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that Pandaria isn't going to vanish into thin air. As long as you're progressing towards your goal, even if it takes you longer than more dedicated players, isn't that still advancing your character? Just curious.

Hidden Klaxxi Daily Quest<br />
WoWInsider has a nice note about a hidden Klaxxi Daily Quest that will net you an extra 130 reputation, along with the normal Valor Points and Lesser Charm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/90458-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune). <br />

Minecraft: World of Warcraft<br />
The recreation of the World of Warcraft map inside of Minecraft is finally complete (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1066364-WoW-to-Minecraft-coordinate-space-conversion)! You can download the map via this torrent (http://cursecraft.com/media/CraftingAzeroth-v0.1-beta.torrent) (2GB, extracting to 24GB). Be sure to take a look at the installation instructions (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1066364-WoW-to-Minecraft-coordinate-space-conversion).<br />
<br />
If you don't have the time and bandwidth to do so, you can take a look at an older version of the map (http://overviewer.org/wow/).<br />

Anybody with common sense could see the item was under valued for its ilvl and that's why many people were buying them up. Common sense makes a lot of people of gold while others lose out.</div></div><hr />

I dont think you understand what &quot;hidden&quot; is. Killing something that drops a &quot;This item starts a quest&quot; is not hidden, that has been around alllll the time. This quest is rather great. it is 100% truly hidden. Most people DO NOT know of this. every day there are people shocked to find such a neat little addition to WoW.

It was rendered by a software but the settings and everything had to be individually configured by Rumsey the creator.</div></div><hr />

Not only for the Klaxxi, but u can fish 3 quest starting items while doing angler dailies or just fishing in Karasang Wilds.<br />
You can also get a drop quest from the Hozen while doing Tiller dailies.<br />
<br />
and only few people know, that coming back to the daily questhubs between 2 and 4 am, let's you do some additional dailies as long as u turn them in before 4 am.</div></div><hr />

To those brats that are huffing and puffing over selling the trinket for abysmally low pre-buff; did you seriously not think they would buff it? I mean, just look at the other decks in comparison, there's NO WAY it would have stayed. You've been playing this game for years, be more intuitive...haha.</div></div><hr />

What exactly is unfair about the change to honor gear? Everyone has access to the same pvp gear so what difference does it make?</div></div><hr />

You didn't lose anything, you just didn't make as much.<br />

Why should they warn anyone? Like Lavafoxx said, you didnt lose anything, you just didnt make as much as before the change.<br />
<br />
and no, they didnt nerf honor gear, they made it less PVE viable. Those who bought it for something it was never intended to be for. you could have invested just as much time in the PVE equivalent sources and gotten the pve gear.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they are &quot;fun&quot; but I do think they are great way to make character progression at least slightly gated. They may have gone a little too far and the dailies could probably earn rep a little faster, but overall it feels fantastic. IMO.</div></div><hr />

This is a great quest and more interesting than the other hidden dailies where you simply kill something to start the daily quest. Klaxxi does have 3 hidden dailies that rotate depending on which dailies are available. Hidden quest is hidden.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barael</div><div class="date">2012-10-10, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I noticed about Relic, probably due to a bug (I did submit a report), is that if you use it it actually puts your other trinket to a 1 MINUTE cooldown. Yes, it puts the other trinket to the same cooldown as itself, NOT the duration of the effect (12 seconds). This doesn't happen when you use the other trinket first; for example using the Brawler's Trinket just puts the Relic on 20-second cooldown. So if you're using Relic with another Use-trinket, you must always use the other trinket first and then use Relic very soon afterwards so you don't push the cooldown back on the first trinket.</div></div><hr />
