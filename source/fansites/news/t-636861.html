If you've been reading this site for more than 3 days, you probably know that a new Legendary Mace will be added to the game with Patch 3.1. Just like with Atiesh in Naxxramas, you will have to drop multiple Fragments of Val'anyr (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/fragmentsvalanyr.jpg) to be able to start the quest chain to rebuild the mace.The Shattered Fragments of Val'anyr (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/fragmentsvalanyr.jpg) will most likely drop from bosses in Ulduar, you need 40 of them to rebuild the mace. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/valanyr40_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/valanyr40.jpg)<br />
<br />
When all fragments are in your possession, you will be able to start the following quest :<br />
<br />
Ancient History<br />
The pieces fit together to form an elegant hammer. Its construction appears to be at least partially Titan in nature. The console inside the Archivum might have some information regarding this artifact.<br />
Bring the Shattered Fragments of Val'anyr to the Archivum Console in the Archivum in Ulduar. <br />
<br />
The Archivum (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/ulduarsandbox/ulduar_13.jpg) is the small room behind The Assembly of Iron (where the Iron Council is). After a small event the follow-up will require you to kill ... The old god Yogg-Saron (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/yoggsaron.jpg) in his prison (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/ulduarsandbox/ulduar_76.jpg)! <br />
<br />
Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings<br />
The Archivum console has hinted at a possible way to rebind the fragments of Val'anyr: you must get the fragments inside the physical form of the being known as Yogg-Saron. It sounds like a long shot, but for an artifact of such power you think the risk might just be worth it.<br />
Throw the Shattered Pieces of Val'anyr inside Yogg-Saron's exposed brain and defeat Yogg-Saron to recover the Reforged Hammer of Ancient Kings.<br />
<br />
I couldn't find anything in the game files below this point, but I'll assume it doesn't take much after that to end up with the mace in your hands ... below is the (still unconfirmed) model. <br />

More changes to ammos and shards later<br />
This upcoming patch will be the largest one we've ever done with tons of new content and a lot of class changes. However, we still have to pick our battles. We can't get pursue every idea we have and still complete the patch in a reasonable amount of time, and I know I'm getting pretty impatient myself for Ulduar.<br />
<br />
These are small steps. If we like the way they turn out, there will be larger steps in time to arrows and shards. I'd love to share our ideas, but they need to bake a little longer and we need to make sure we can actually deliver so players don't feel like we broke any promises. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443406200-32-shards-max-might-be-huge-buff.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring the player, not the class&quot; in PvP<br />
<br />
<br />
We definitely want to get more specs into PvP. However, one of the coolest parts of Arena is building comps with certain synergies. I'm not sure it would be a good design goal to say almost any 2, 3 or 5 classes can form a good team together. And yet the roles in PvP are quite different than in PvE. There are some Arena teams with no healers and some with several. We can't just tell players to pick up a healer and you're good to do, because the healer you get can change things dramatically.<br />
<br />
Let's get a little more parity in Arenas first and get in those classes and specs that have historically been underepresented, and then we can start thinking about how much sense it makes to give players more flexibility on how they form their team.

Heart of the Wild nerf in 3.1<br />
In order to keep our goal of having all 4 tank classes capable of handling Ulduar, we need to get tank health pools a little closer together.<br />
<br />
While I won't hide that this is a nerf for bears, we also don't want to get to the point of having a &quot;mana sponge&quot; tank, now that we are making mana more of an issue for healers.<br />
<br />
If druids slip behind as a result of lack of mitigation, avoidance or cooldowns, we will buff them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15443285411-heart-of-the-wild-nerfed-to-10.html))<br />
<br />
Lifebloom changes in 3.1<br />
Rolling Lifeblooms on 2-3 tanks is just hands down one of the most -- probably the most -- efficient heals in the game. We didn't want to nerf the amount Lifebloom heals, but we were concerned druids would jump to the top of the healer stack pretty quickly with the recent mana changes.<br />
<br />
We added the bonus to the bloom to improve its use in PvP, where you can't always keep 3 stacks rolling, and for say throwing a single spell on a rogue where you don't plan on keeping it rolling.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that yanking the hot removal of DKs is also a druid buff for PvP.<br />
<br />
Edit: I meant to add that we discussed getting the same effect by having the 2nd or 3rd application of the spell on the same target increase in mana cost. But that becomes pretty complex to explain in a tooltip and might be too mathy for quick calculations when deciding whether you want to roll blooms or not. <br />
<br />
[...] We think rolling is a fun part of the spell. It's just too efficient and makes Lifebloom the best heal per second and heal per mana. We don't want you to change the way you use the spell, at least in terms of single tank healing. The bonus on a bloom or dispel is just supposed to be a bonus.<br />
<br />
If the numbers aren't right, we'll continue to tweak them. It may be that the cost needed to go up by 75% instead of 100% for example. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15443525520-major-change-to-lifebloom-please-explain.html))<br />
<br />
Resto druid role<br />
Someone asked whether we were intending to change the Resto druid's role. We aren't. All of these changes fall, in our minds at least, into the realms of balance or polish.<br />
<br />
Fixing mana regeneration and Lifebloom efficiency are balance problems. Both were too good. Separating the roles of Nourish and Regrowth a little is a polish issue. They were too close together.<br />
<br />
One of the things I still feel works the best about the Resto druid is in how different players can heal using different strategies and still be succesful. We have a long way to go with some classes and specs to give them that level of variety. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15443305431-ok-lets-discuss-the-issueresto-druids.html))<br />

Explosive Shot<br />
Yes, we did nerf the damage of Explosive Shot a little more. After many of the changes to locks, DKs, warriors and the rest, we felt SV hunters were too high. MM may still be a little too low. BM seems on target at the moment, but we had a few bugs in new pet abilities especially that was making it hard to get accurate numbers.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you mean about Survival compexity. Are you talking about the shots themselves or the organization of the tree? I think some players are still thinking they are supposed to trap dance in PvE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443525832-31-hunter-patch-notes-confusion.html))<br />

Quiver removal in 3.1 and effects on Steady Shot<br />
We just wanted to remove the quiver without losing its haste bonus. Except for inventory changes, you should not notice a difference. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443525832-31-hunter-patch-notes-confusion.html))<br />

Viper Sting<br />
Yes, that is pretty close to how we feel. Poisons are a weakness of the priest class. We don't want to remove that weakness. However Viper Sting exploited that weakness to a very punishing degree. Poison removal, as many other classes will tell you, does not solve &quot;the rogue problem&quot; and I'm not sure there is &quot;a rogue problem&quot; any longer.

Drain Soul and Soul Shards in 3.1<br />
Drain Soul will produce enough shards that you should never be without them. Even if you are learning a boss through repeated wiping, you should be able to get the new shards you need each attempt.<br />
<br />
In fact, it produces so many shards that we figured you'd end up having to delete them constantly, which would be annoying. The 32 limit will fill up your largest bag (which only holds shards anyway) without spilling over into the rest of your inventory. We figured very few locks carried around a lot more shards than that, and like I said, they are easy enough to replace now for those of you who do manage to go through them quickly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443406200-32-shards-max-might-be-huge-buff.html))<br />
<br />
Pandemic and Resilience<br />
Yes, I believe this was true. Shadowform was affected by resilience, but Pandemic was not. It was not out intention that the talent let you skip around resilience. Making sure the talent is an appropriate damage increase is important to use, but we won't do it by letting you avoid the damage reduction that resilience is designed to impart. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15230880048-math-31-pandemic-in-pvp-934-nerf.html))<br />
<br />
DoTs crits in 3.1<br />
I think we can all agree that when dots crit and when direct damage spells crit, they are affected the same way.<br />
<br />
So these arguments basically come down to &quot;It is unfair that dots that don't crit are affected by resilience when direct damage spells are not.&quot; But this is arguing against the way resilience has worked for some time and the way it works for warlocks and priests without the talents in question is unfair. You are essentially arguing dots are too weak in PvP on live today, and have been too weak since we first made resilience affect them. Adding a talent that lets them do more damage in some situations should not change the rules for what happens to them normally, at least in our opinion.<br />
<br />
You can also argue that warlocks and shadow priests are too weak, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the resilience rules on dots are the problem. Our main goal is that resilience should be something all classes need to contend with regardless of how they do damage.<br />
<br />
Now, there is another way to go. We could just say that dots always can crit (i.e. remove Pandemic et al.) and resilience affects them the same way as direct damage spells, and then readjust all the numbers to make sure dots are not too powerful when they don't crit. That would be a valid approach, but aside from being a ton of work, it's just not the direction we want to take the feature.<br />
<br />
I agree with the posters who said that the problem with saying &quot;double dipping&quot; and similar phrases is that you risk confusing players who think that dots that crit are reduced twice by resilience, which doesn't happen. They ARE reduced by resilience whether they crit or not, which is our intention and apparently working correctly. I do agree that the mechanics here are fairly technical for players not well versed in them. <br />
<br />
We do appreciate the numbers though. It is nice to be able double check our own calculations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15443245700-you-say-dots-dont-get-hit-harder-by-resil.html))<br />

Rage generation while shielded<br />
Our plan is to allow warriors (probably druids too) to generate rage when being hit while protected by an absorption shield AND also while hitting a target with an absorption shield.<br />
<br />
We think we can get this in, but I am reluctant to use the word &quot;promise&quot; ever. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15234887705-warrior-suggestion-compilation.html))<br />

I (as a bear) never cared much about my equip. I tanked whole 10man Naxx with few heroic drops and quest rewards and I've done 25man with the handful of drops I got from two weeks going 10man without any problems.<br />
So, without comparing to other tanking classes this never felt right. Equipment was no problem and I almost had forgotten that I have two use effects on trinkets, survival instincts, barkskin and glyphed frenzied regeneration. I hardly needed my ohshit buttons.<br />
<br />
Once I even forgot to switch back to my tank equip during bosses like Gluth and Faerlina. Yes, the latter one with achievement. Sad thing is, nobody noticed except me before Maexxna, when I realized Itemrack did not make the rustling sound when I tried to switch to kitty gear.<br />
<br />
So what is point? There are two possible reasons for this I suppose:<br />
a) Bears are overpowered (through stamina, armor or dodge or a combination of those)<br />
b) Tanking is too easy if your healers are good enough.<br />
<br />
In early endgame, a) is true. In current, later endgame it just may be b) and by only a very small margin a).<br />
I agree that for random/bad groups the druid is first choice - he is always immune to crits and if you pick a random feral druid he is by 80% chance or what better tank than a randomly picked warrior, dk or paladin. However, this is just his status in early endgame.<br />
<br />
Are there any high end warrior, dk or paladin tanks who are feeling the same?</div></div><hr />

Something interesting:<br />
<br />
Banishment by the Titans<br />
<br />
Yogg-Saron, along with the other Old Gods, created the Curse of Flesh to infect and assimilate the Titans' creations, such as the Earthen. The Titans discovered that if the Old Gods were destroyed, any infected creations would also be destroyed. Alternatively, the Titans kept the Old Gods alive and imprisoned them beneath Azeroth.<br />
<br />
So, if the &quot;curse of flesh&quot; is meant here, how are we able to kill Gods?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-03-02, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some quotes from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
- Viper Sting re-designed: Stings the target, draining 4% of mana over 8 sec (up to a maximum of 8% of the caster's maximum mana), and energizing the Hunter equal to 300% of the amount drained. Only one Sting per Hunter can be active on any one target. <br />
<br />
- As a few players have suggested, we think the solution here is just to make sure that hunters and rogues aren't so good versus priests simply because of the lack of poison removal. We don't think that needs to be giving Abolish Poison or the like to priests. <br />
<br />
- There was a pretty hefty nerf to Viper Sting recently. It should be much less of a priest killer.<br />
<br />
- Yes, that is pretty close to how we feel. Poisons are a weakness of the priest class. We don't want to remove that weakness. However Viper Sting exploited that weakness to a very punishing degree. Poison removal, as many other classes will tell you, does not solve &quot;the rogue problem&quot; and I'm not sure there is &quot;a rogue problem&quot; any longer.<br />
<br />
Viper Sting has been nerfed so badly, i wonder why they even kept the spell ingame. 4% mana drain on a 10k mana pool = 400 mana drained over 8 seconds.<br />
The spell itself costs 8% of the hunters mana! Im mean, seriously? Is this some kind of sick joke!?<br />
<br />
Tbh, i couldnt care less if Viper Sting got removed from game. Only classes that had issues with Viper Sting was the Priest, and the Hunter himself.<br />
ViperSting may have been good when ppl didnt had 10k mana pools, and when it had a 30% chance not to get dispelled. But if ur a Hunter, and ur using Viper Sting vs any class other then Priests, Hunters and maybe sometimes a mage then u need start to l2play. Using ViperSting on the Hunter is the best thing for Arena.. Why? A hunter has around 8/9k mana, and his abilitys cost alot of that mana. Hunters have huge mana issues in PVP because we cant spam SS shot and autoshot that much, since we keep running around shooting the instant shots. ViperSting helps getting the Hunter completly OOM, thus he must use Aspect of the Viper at a 50% dmg loss wich is a HUGE dps penalty.<br />
<br />
A paladin dispells costs what 90 mana? A Viper Sting around 400, u'll OOM urself before u get the paladin below 80% mana using ViperSting. I can only hope that the mana regen nerf is really really big, since nuking down any kind of healer with a full mana bar is really hard.<br />
<br />
The replacement for ViperSting is gonna be Pummel, the new Gorilla ability. Interrupt spellcast for 4 seconds on a 10 sec CD.<br />
Unfortunatly, only 1 pet will have this ability, and will very fastly become the most popular pet in Arena and PVP. Thus will get nerfed in an upcomming patch or hotfix.<br />
<br />
Im actually quite happy with the Viper Sting nerf, because it now allows me to remove the spell from my bars and preventing me to be stupid enough to use this selfdraining ability to complete OOM myself trying to OOM someone else before i can realise it just doenst work vs healers that can dispell it.<br />
<br />
The huge flaw in this nerf is, why give us yet another USELESS ability? We have plenty as it is: Scorpid Sting, Snake Trap, Aspect of the Wild, Aspect of the Beast, Mongoose Bite, Concussive Shot, Distracting Shot, and now we can add Viper Sting to this list..</div></div><hr />

Yes, now how capable does someone look when he designes something like that?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, (and I gues understandably) Blizzard makes mistakes that they are sometimes blind to, or do not admit as to not sound incapable... Players have to live with it... it goes for all classes, not just hunters in this case.<br />
<br />
And nerfing explosiv shot AGAIN is annoying, but noone (Especially Blizzard) except hunters understands that a hunter in pvp has two things to his side. Ranged spikes and the ability to maintain the range. Both have to be pulled of well, or the hunter is worthless. <br />
<br />
Nerfing dissengage to extra 5 seconds was silly, because anyone who had more problems with hunters because of dissengage as a defencive skill, than with other classes, speaks bad of his own skill and class knowledge.<br />
It was the combination of a few things, so go ahead and nerf explosiv shot a few more times until it goes back to the &quot;just another shot&quot; skill it was once, but make survival tree a SURVIVAL tree again...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Seems like BM is gonna turn out nice with the new pets abilities, and Gorillas are gonna be most used pets for PVP. Ive allready got one myself.<br />
<br />
The nerfs to Survival are pretty hard, id say almost comparable to the BM nerf. Lets review them again<br />
<br />
- TNT: No longer stuns, removed the 6% crit chance on explosive shot. Then they add a glyph wich gives 4% crit chance to Explosive shot, forcing you to take it, and make this a nerf by 2% crit on Explosive shot, and a waste of Major Glyph. TNT Now adds 6% damage to Explosive shot, BUT Explosive shot gets nerfed by 10% and nerfed with a 12.5% scaling with AP. Again u get forced into taking TNT to make this a 4% damage nerf to explosive shot. Dont forget they removed the stun, and all this talent does is add 6% dmg to 1 of your shots. Before i knew Explosive shot got nerfed by 10% i would even consider to skip this talent.<br />
<br />
- Lock and Load: No longer procs on Explosive trap and Snake trap, making these 2 traps more useless then they allready are (remove from game maybe?). Also no longer has a 10% chance to proc on the spammeble Serpent Sting, as if it procced that much!? INSTEAD it now has a 8% chance to proc on Immolation trap 22/24 sec CD and Black Arrow 1 min CD.<br />
In addition, Lock and Load wont proc on Frost and Freeze traps in PVE since bosses are immune to those effects, and those traps will no longer trigger its effect when a target is immune. (Pala bubbles are also Immune, thus also wont proc the Lock n Load, to start nuke after bubble. Nice way for paladins to break our traps in PVP.)<br />
The proc chance will go down in PVE by alot, since most hunters used to proc Lock and Load by traps that gave a 100% proc chance. Serpent sting was unreliable.<br />
<br />
- Black Arrow: Adds all dmg done to the target with Blackarrow by 6% (hope it cant be dispelled) and leaves a dot that ticks shadowdmg. We had a 10% nerf to explosive shot + 6% dmg increase with TNT = 4% dmg nerf to Explosive shot. Putting Black Arrow on the target will make this a 2% dmg increase of Explosive shot. But we also get 12.5% less AP scaling, so my gues is that Explosive shot wont change much dmg wise. But we now have to put Black Arrow on the target all the time, and it will break your trap. So we either have to choose.. more dmg or more cc?<br />
<br />
- Disengage: 5 Sec CD nerf. Atm a Survival hunter could have a 16 sec cd on Disengage with the talents and the Glyph. Now im forced to keep my Glyph wich reduced Disengage by 5 seconds, otherwise this would be a 10 second nerf for PVP hunters. Why not just remove the glyph and keep it at a 25 sec CD? At least then we could take another glyph!<br />
<br />
I hope PTR is gonna be up for another month so they can adjust some of their numbers before this goes live.</div></div><hr />

Freya looks like she could be kinda hard for a 10 man withou the right setup, but looks easy on heroic. The adds should do more damage, and they need to add a extra element to the fight, like if u die she gains a buff an raid takes dmg like archimonde<br />
Iron council acually looks hard enough, this encounter looks good already<br />
Thorim hits like a truck, but he needs like 2-3 extra elements added imo, way to easy<br />
Finally, Hodir looks WAY too easy and needs to be like entirely changed<br />

If the splinters work like they did in Naxx, it won't be a guaranteed drop off each boss. Give it 2-3 months before the first one is even crafted.</div></div><hr />

If this is really a bothersome part of the game for you, then I feel sorry for you. Personally, I'd rather have Blizz focus their attention on much more pressing matters than a &quot;dance studio&quot;.<br />

Again, I hope you are right. Give people something to work for, to be rewarded for. Get that Ghostcrawler Crab to nerf all this Carebear Casual Player Love rubbish. Give us a reward that is worth it.

&quot;Heart of the Wild nerf in 3.1<br />
In order to keep our goal of having all 4 tank classes capable of handling Ulduar, we need to get tank health pools a little closer together.<br />

While I won't hide that this is a nerf for bears, we also don't want to get to the point of having a &quot;mana sponge&quot; tank, now that we are making mana more of an issue for healers.<br />
<br />
If druids slip behind as a result of lack of mitigation, avoidance or cooldowns, we will buff them.&quot;<br />
This is a slap in the face for bear tanks as DK's are currently able to get more hp than a bear in pure stam gear bye swapping out a trinket and a ring while having more cooldowns and emergency buttons at their disposal. Really blizz are you trying to nerf bears to the point no-one plays them as we are currently out threated bye warrs pallys and dk's much less avoidance than Dk's with only 3kish armor as compensation........</div></div><hr />

Of course healers (and all casters and paladins) got no legendary weapons in TBC (well unless you count the temporary ones in the eye). So a legendary for a only certain classes is consistent.</div></div><hr />

Give people something to work for, to be rewarded for. Get that Ghostcrawler Crab to nerf all this Carebear Casual Player Love rubbish. Give us a reward that is worth it. Although, a legendary item, just for the Healers? This seems to be an attempt at a pathetic appology for all the nerfs...<br />
<br />
<br />
Because 25 man Raiding is harder than 10 man Amiright? Like 10 man Sartharion 3 Drakes and countless other fights?<br />
<br />
If they put the legendary in heroic mode only I agree, but at least make it more difficult, not the other way around...</div></div><hr />

i my self as a feral tank do not agree that pallys an warrs an dks out threat druids while i main tank sarth and VoA always have a pally off tank and they do not manage to out agro me and i am able to regain agro after being picked up buy the big barsterd in voa with no problem i am verry unhappy at the POTENTAL nerf of bear tanks as this is my main and ppl who say other clases out dodge druids well in some cases yes but to druids who have no idea how to gear themselves with balance between dodge and stam and agi</div></div><hr />

I do have to be more active in positioning myself when I OT and need to gather up adds. Chal. Roar (+glyph) helps only a little in this case but then I risk aggroing the boss, like when that happend in OS10 the other night. We often seen in OT roles anyways, since we easily can switch to a DPS form when the add(s) are dead.<br />
<br />
I've yet to see the Savage Defend ability in action to really see where us bears stand.. However when I tank a single target there's isnt a dps in my guild anyways who can take the aggro away. So all depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
Maybe the thorn glyph should give some extra threat caused from the mobs hitting us..</div></div><hr />

Once we were the high armored Bears with massive amounts of health that took a lot of damage but managed that because we were powerfull massive beasts. But we and with us the other tanking classes change to a clone of &quot;standart tank class&quot;. <br />
loss of flavor, loss of fun. i changed to feral dps with wotlk and will stay there. i´m not even sure if bear tanking is still my choice for dualspecc. i´m very sad about that because i loved tanking as a bear, but with the recent changes i fear even more boredom with the all equal tanking classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how I would take this line of text: you would gather 40 shards and turn it into the Shattered Pieces and then risk it ALL by throwing the item into Yogg-Saron while fighting him (might happen during a certain phase). You then have to kill the boss that try (or maybe that reset, try would be more hardcore though) and you can then loot the legendary.</div></div><hr />

I like the variety. Thinking about a plate kilt is kind of weird, but hey, it's not like it's T3, T6, or T9. Just T8. Live with it. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because blizz dont want this wep to be optainable on the PTR<br />
i bet it will say Unique (40) when it hits the live servers</div></div><hr />
