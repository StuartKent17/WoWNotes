A new build is being deployed on test realms. 
 
Update - Murkablo - Preview #2 (Now with Animations) 
Murkablo got a couple of animations in this patch, half of them are new and half of them are from the Deathwing mini-pet (because, well, you know, it kinda makes sense for the Murloc/Diablo mini-pet to breath fire)

Most likely confirms the theory that the &quot;Tarecgosa Mount&quot; datamined is just a transformation during the questline and not an actual mount.<br />

I see what you mean, but its always been a problem. Bosses have always turned on a pin head for as long as I can remember. C'thun was one that always stands out when I played my rogue. Backstab is just what It says. Fortunately Rogues only have to deal with that past 30%.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, why not play a spec because you enjoy it or know the rotation rather then FOTM reroll/respec because you're no longer quite so beast-OP on multi-target fights?<br />

The point is there is no such thing as &quot;ranged&quot; agility because it is a primary stat- so a rogue could get the 300 agi buff from the proc and have full use of it on all dmg instead of just auto ranged attacks (unlike ranged AP or ranged hit rating on the current cata scopes that can be limited)</div></div><hr />

It has not been confirmed yet, but we may expect it to be the next Blizzcon pet. As long as I can remember, they have been giving a murloc themed in-game item, be it a pet, a mount, a costume or else.<br />

It's not really tears, it is simply wondering what in the hell the spell is worth for now that it lived a patch and half. It was introduced with Cata, and it will be dead in 4.2 patch...of the same Xpac. That was like giving paladins a shield, yet putting 25 days CD on it and telling them...use something else bud.</div></div><hr />

I call it bull. To have around 40% Wild Quiver proc you would need around 2000 mastery rating on your gear. I checked some Ensidia hunters who wears full 372 gear and reforged they have barely a bit over 1000 mastery rating.

<br />
What may be beast and OP in some aspects, is just crucial in others. Soul swap has now become a useless ability. For starters, it only transfers certain dots, secondly, it takes those dots off your first target and applies them fully on your second, unglyphed. At best this means that you can dot up a new target about 2 seconds quicker, considering most of the dots it transfers are instant cast. Now while glyphed, it will leave the dots on the previous target, but the 30 second cooldown means that you're not using it again until the next group of mobs. Compare this to a DK that is able to spread his/her diseases instantly to every target within 10yrds, and you'll see why it's a big deal. it means running out of mana quicker, having to lifetap more in situations where many healers don't even want to throw a lock a HoT because it's self inflicted damage.</div></div><hr />

My bigger question: how many Multi-target fights are there? I guess the Whelps on Halfus, the adds on Maloriak, neither of which that THAT beastly that you need to squeeze your DPS out on them.

Hell just take out the warlock they are easily the weakest of the caster DPS and they just non stop get the nerf bat time after time when they need buffed.. GFG nerf the fing mage.<br />

<br />
Even including a margin of error... elemental is far, far worse off right now in PVE. You're not the weakest of the caster DPS. Quit being melodramatic.<br />

<br />
Now for the pet. I am a MAJOR pet collector with 158 of them in my tab, sad that I missed out on the olympic one but regardless. I do like the fact that I have my murloc collection and that they all have different animations (lets not mention the Arena one simply because it has NO animations at all, sad thing) , given blizzards past with blizzcon rewards there really is no doubt that this pet is the new blizzcon pet, some people may suggest the Diablo 3 CE pet, but look at what they did for SC2 we got a mini thor.<br />
<br />
My whole point to this is that really alot of people are paying the 40$ for the live stream of blizzcon really for the pet. And with this years model being so close in design and now with half the animations stolen from the previous years pet. I have to say im more then alittle dissapointed. Is there anything that Blizzard isnt going to put half an effort in when it comes to WoW anymore?<br />
<br />
Cata was half done, uninspired, 4.1 was a joke with reused content with retextured models from 3+ years ago, we hear more about premium features they want to introduce into the game and now they take the one cool thing about going to blizzcon and cheapen it. those pets and blizzcon in game items are status symbols that you get to show off to the people on your server, why reuse another model and animation for a new pet?<br />
<br />
has blizzard just given up? do they feel like its no longer an interest to push out quality ,do they just assume because its blizzard people will buy it?</div></div><hr />

We will be fine with DPS. Our weapons scale like crazy and we are getting a crafted epic two-hander. (Just start saving some mats and BOOM, no DPS loss).<br />
<br />
Also if you roll as Arms it is not really a loss anyways. Most Arms players stay in BS and do not move from that other then the burn phase. Put a couple points in tactical mastery and stance dance while doing your rotation (This is from 100%-20%) and you will see almost a 5% jump.

I hope you're talking about 4.2 and beyond, b/c if mages are beating your dps right now in worse gear on a non-gimmick fight. You're just bad as an Affliction lock. Right now Affliction locks and MM hunters are topping the meters in most T11 fights, so I don't see how you're #13 out of 18 if you're playing your spec right.<br />

That would be because your bad. Warlocks have EXCELLENT single target dps, multi target dps, and AOE dps (if the adds are up long enough). Just because YOUR #13 out of 18 doesnt mean anything. I could be playing a MM hunter and be #13 out of 18, but its not because of the class, its because of my skill.<br />
<br />
In a list of full BiS gear, for every class, warlocks hold 2 of the top 10, only ranged classes above them being MM hunter and arcane mage. The rest being warriors and frost DKs.<br />
<br />
Pointless QQ pointed twords 'poor class design' when in reality, its just human error.</div></div><hr />

The two hander you're speaking of is a downgrade from whats available in heroic raids at the moment and one of the stats on it is haste which is terrible for Arms or TG. We do scale well but not &quot;like crazy&quot; This isn't wrath anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must be mistaken. These numbers are taken from the BiS gearsets of both classes.<br />
Im going to start out with 2H frost DKs (because comparing DW1h wouldnt be nearly as accurate, and ret sucks atm)<br />
A frost DKs scaling factors are as follows.<br />
Wspeed=139.17<br />
Wdps=9.75<br />
<br />
An Arms warriors scaling factor is as follows<br />
Wspeed=390.59<br />
Wdps=14.54<br />
<br />
So yes, arms DOES scale like fucking crazy with weapons<br />
(these numbers came from the BiS set, using SimulationCraft)</div></div><hr />

Def. System, Cho'Gall, Halfus, and a couple others) but it wasn't &quot;Do or die&quot; by any means, it was just a convenience. Couple this with the drain life nerf and things are still a bit dicey, but hey what can you do? <br />
<br />
As an aff lock I am really enjoying it right now and do competitive dps (despite the fact I don't have any set of T11, just one piece) and am happy that I can still be #1 - #3 in my raid (of 10, 2 dps usually mages, fire and arcane, with a hunter and boomkin/feral in the mix) without having to struggle with no tier. <br />
<br />
This is but one change I forsee in the future (not that I want any more) and as much as I like destro, having now recently changed over to afflic and changed all my reforges to that extreme as well, it is too good for me to jump out on now. I will ride this wave till things go south, but I like affliction, it is fun, it keeps me busy and it's not as mind numbing as destro (god I tried arcane on my alt and wanted to shoot myself) and not as clunky as demo. <br />

problem is where you just keep 2 dots up on your secondary target we are supposed to have 3xSE up at all times along with 3 dots. A much much more difficult proposition and a huge quality of life nurf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This does barely nothing for Aff's dps, it just makes it more annoying to keep dots on 2 targets.<br />
<br />
Quality of life nerf. Bad move Bliz.<br />
<br />
um... you do know dots are our damage? <br />
<br />
Yeah this is a 50% nerf after the 25% dl nerf, gj blizz. Make a new spell and nerf it until it's not useable, I guess they don't want us dps'ing two things at once..</div></div><hr />

Our weapons scale like crazy and we are getting a crafted epic two-hander. (Just start saving some mats and BOOM, no DPS loss).<br />
<br />
Also if you roll as Arms it is not really a loss anyways. Most Arms players stay in BS and do not move from that other then the burn phase. Put a couple points in tactical mastery and stance dance while doing your rotation (This is from 100%-20%) and you will see almost a 5% jump. (The only attack you need to go back to BS for is OP).<br />
<br />
Just make some macros and you are all good. It almost becomes mindless.<br />
<br />
I got Nefarian HC weapon so the crafting one will not match, and yupp im already a stance dancing Arms warrior :)</div></div><hr />

I would like to report people for stupidity. All you see is recount numbers, and you completely disregard what the mage has to do to achieve those numbers. <br />
<br />
Lets imagine your Moonkin would do less and less damage the less mana you have left, and could only cast 4 wraths in a row or risk using up too much mana gimping your damage output except in burn phase, which means you have to plan your spell and damage CD usage around a mana regeneration CD which is channelled! <br />
<br />
With your druid you only have to pay attention which spell to use to limbo between solar and lunar eclipses and can completely disregard the blue bar below your health.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, re: Marks changes<br />
<br />
Auto shot is such a minor part of our damage that this mastery change isn't going to do much. Hunters will not be reforging or gemming for mastery, Hunters will still be hard casting Aimed Shot when under the effects of Rapid Fire, Bloodlust/Time Warp, or under other haste or casting speed increases. Aimed Shot still scales entirely too well and Blizz knows this. The mastery changes are just to soften the blow of what we're losing with the Careful Aim nerf.</div></div><hr />

Thankyou very much for your misleading information, we all know we can find the sustainable dps of a class from charts and logs, of which your analogy is basically irrelevant.<br />

Engineering: Flintlocke's Woodchucker is now restricted to hunters. <br />
Thats non-sense.<br />

^^ This (for PVE).<br />
<br />
Guessing it is affliction warlocks usefullness in 3s that triggered this. Too bad the whole Soul swap mechanich makes Blizz tune warlocks so that we aren't that usefull 1 on 1 or 2 on 2. I'd rather have them remove the whole soul swap crap, and give me a bigger chance to survive 1 on 1 in PVP.<br />
<br />

They didn't restrict a damn Legendary (Like Glaives/Shadowmourne) to the class that primarily uses it to deal damage, yet they &quot;restrict&quot; a scope. It's just hilarious in all regards.<br />
<br />
*cough* bullshit *cough*<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne dear sir was restricted for plate wearers (DK, Warrior and Paladin) only and so was the whole quest line. It was impossible for other classes to obtain it. Don't spread false informations.<br />
<br />
If not by class then by quest line new legendary will be impossible to get by class not designated to do so. Don't you worry bro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">powerstuck</div><div class="date">2011-06-07, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be because your bad. Warlocks have EXCELLENT single target dps, multi target dps, and AOE dps (if the adds are up long enough). Just because YOUR #13 out of 18 doesnt mean anything. I could be playing a MM hunter and be #13 out of 18, but its not because of the class, its because of my skill.<br />
<br />
In a list of full BiS gear, for every class, warlocks hold 2 of the top 10, only ranged classes above them being MM hunter and arcane mage. The rest being warriors and frost DKs.<br />
<br />
Pointless QQ pointed twords 'poor class design' when in reality, its just human error.<br />
<br />
Dude, seriously stop smoking the same crap that Blizzard is. Warlocks and Hunter are AWEFULL on Aoe damage no matter what circumstances. If the mob needs to live long enough for a warlock to build up his dps maybe you're doing it wrong cuz AOE dmg is supposed to be short sweet and simple, not last 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

With that said affliction dps is hardly bad. Looking at all heroic modes affliction is almost always in top 5 for majority of fights. Top caster tends to vary from fight to fight but it's not always mage or lock or boomkin or shadow priest. Looks like a good mix imo people just like to complain alot when any nerf happens. If you are at the bottom of the dps meters as affliction you are either a) your doing it wrong or b) your doing it wrong c) all of the above</div></div><hr />

Most people are not complaining being a nerf, they are, and i am aswell, complaining about something, that is not a technical nerf but simply an useless spell now. They would have removed soul swap and it would have been no different that giving it a 30 sec CD.</div></div><hr />

I'll end my subscription 400 000 and me. Its pathetic blizzard... I've been waiting for destruction to be fixed sinds start of cata. Where is the destruction with 12k crits if you can only survive 3minutes max in arena 2.2k +. Soul swap nerve is kinda interesting, makes me think of pvping without the glyph... easier to switch targets while being able to cc better (sap's etc). But I wont be there to test it as its not new and I can imagine the even more hardcasting of ua which will be a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
Bring back destruction, in the meanwhile I'll enjoy duke nukem/bf3 (depending on how long it would take).<br />
<br />
Indeed. First of all it was sad, then it became just pathetic. I was waiting for destruction changes for ages. You cant kill anything with 10-15 k crits and no defense at all. Interrupt- stun- dead. And if to mention affliction- it is not the best spec as well. You have to cast dots 3 times on one target to make him die. And Soul Swap helps to cast less (less interrupts). Sometimes it seems that warlocks used to crit more in Wotlk (at least fail chaos bolt used to).</div></div><hr />
