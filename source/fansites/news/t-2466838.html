They give you almost 2k reputation which at 10k gives you random lootbokses that may have stuff inside. Also 7th legion / Honorbound gives you marks which net you mounts, pets and toys.<br />

Also some evil that needs to be kept in bay etc etc etc...</div></div><hr />

The only thing i would change would be shell game for Loh. Loh is great, you complete is fast in less than 30 sec, and you can do it in many alts.<br />
If i do shell game more than 8 times in a day, my head starts spinning lol</div></div><hr />

I know there are several bosses in ToT and SoO that already drop pets. I guess they could add more. Either way, I love these achievements</div></div><hr />

That celestial mogu shit is probably the laziest thing I have ever seen in wow.<br />
<br />
Funny, because I think that's one of the coolest ones in that spread. How is that more lazy than shrinking down a model used in the fight? Because that's what half of the others are.</div></div><hr />

Did this on PTR and first run through the raids netted no pets at all (first time that's happened with any RWL) and though oh oh, RNG is being upped to BFA levels. But, then ran another 5-6 times and ended with all of them so must have just had really bad RNG first run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Essence of pride would make more sense if it dropped from Sha of Pride (which already has 2 pet drops) or Garrosh Hellscream (the one who unleashed the sha of pride on the vale). Although both of them are from Siege of Org and not the 3 raids that made up the first &quot;tier&quot; of MoP.</div></div><hr />

Only putting pets in the first raid tier is a bit odd though, but TBC and Wrath had just 3 instances of pets too (Cata had everything). You'd think Ravenous Prideling would have dropped from Sha of Pride in SoO and it might have originally been created for that purpose. After all, the Grand Empress fight involved possession from the Sha of Fear instead<br />
<br />
The flavor text even references that it's a spawn of the Sha of Pride (most dangerous Sha)</div></div><hr />

What, do the new pets block the entrance to your raid or arena or something? You can still do the same shit you always did, you know...</div></div><hr />

ToT is when they started regularly including pets as raid boss loot. ToT already has six pets, and SoO has four.</div></div><hr />
