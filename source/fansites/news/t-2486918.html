We have just wrapped up the first stress test for WoW Classic and while we understand the concerns that a number of you have mentioned, it helped us in many ways. Testing the login process is certainly an aspect that is very important for us to explore and we did gather some valuable data yesterday, so we appreciate everybody who logged in or even attempted to do so during the testing window – you have helped us prepare WoW Classic for release.

We have just wrapped up the first stress test for WoW Classic and while we understand the concerns that a number of you have mentioned, it helped us in many ways. Testing the login process is certainly an aspect that is very important for us to explore and we did gather some valuable data yesterday, so we appreciate everybody who logged in or even attempted to do so during the testing window – you have helped us prepare WoW Classic for release.<br />
<br />
That said, because of some of the issues that were encountered, we were not able to test other aspects that we’d planned for. As a result, we will be doing another stress test on Wednesday, May 29 from 2-4pm PDT. The stress test realm will become available at 2pm PDT and the level cap will be increased to 10. For access, we will be including everybody who was invited to the test on May 22. Similar to last time, the stress test realm will continue to be available until 4pm PDT on Thursday, May 30 so there is additional time to check out the starting experiences.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that while more issues could impact the play experience, it is very important to perform these tests so we can learn about and fix as many of them as possible before the release on August 27. We thank you for your continued support and we’ll see you back on the WoW Classic stress test realm very soon.<br />
<br />
Hogger also sends his regards…<br />

Druid Forced Choice on Essences<br />
The chosen abilities in PTR data are not final. In particular, the ones that would clearly be overpowered or problematic in PvE (such as Leader of the Pack) are generally cases where the final decision of which PvP Talent to give hasn’t yet been made.<br />
<br />
The primary goal of Conflict and Strife is to provide an interesting choice in PvP by allowing access to an extra PvP Talent. It’s not necessarily going to be a strong option for PvE. The acquisition of this Essence is via PvP, and is totally optional for PvE-focused players. While there may be interesting PvE uses for some of the choices, it is not expected to be a strong competitor on usual PvE criteria (like total throughput) on every spec.<br />

It's even sadder if you see how many self-entitled people are commenting on the various forums butthurt because they didn't get a beta invite yet. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly, the stress test was good but it like capping at level 5. It honestly feels like a tease. Well we want your help but dont want to give you full access like every other alpha/ beta.. thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The stress test is all about testing the login servers, server stability and the new layering system. By limiting to max level 5 they ensure that most players will all be running around in the various starting areas so you are funnelling a high amount of players into a limited space within the game in order to maximise and concentrate the load.<br />
<br />
The regular BETA is for testing and giving feedback on classes, quests, content etc.. The Stress Test is not happening for any of this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crusadernero</div><div class="date">2019-05-24, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose people are outraged of not getting into beta cause people these days are used to play games that are not closed to finished. <br />
<br />
Many people accept bad standard of games, aslong as they get in in &quot;early access&quot; or &quot;beta&quot;. <br />
<br />
Atleast Blizzard is actually running a Beta for a reason, and that is to create the optimal and best experience for everyone at launch. <br />
<br />
I dont get why people are so mad about not getting in. Sure, it would be fun.. But you lose all of your characters and progress. When classic releases you gotta start all over again anyway. The beta is only there to optimize the game, not for our progress when it hits live.<br />
<br />
Beta is more for Blizzard than it is for us, the players. They need valuable data for many things.<br />
<br />
In about 3 months no one cares anymore and have forgotten about not getting invited anyway. It will blow over like most &quot;issues&quot; in the gaming world.</div></div><hr />

It. Was. Never. Scheduled. For. Any. Specific. Date. Before.<br />
Jesus, you people are so ridiculously selfish. You have absolutely no reason to be upset or to whine. Classic is being delivered this summer as promised (and anyone with half a brain would have figured out it was going to be released mid 8.2 tier which always meant late summer), and the beta is not something you've &quot;earned&quot; or &quot;have the right to play&quot; under any circumstances either. Now run off to your private server and never, ever return!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Echorausch</div><div class="date">2019-05-24, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't get why people are so upset not being in the beta. Levelling in classic is slow, very slow. Getting to level 30 (the current cap) takes quite some time. If they rise it to 60 it will be even more of a grind. And since you can't keep your beta character you will do it all over again end of august anyway. <br />
<br />
So, save you breath and start levelling the day WoW Classic finally comes out, and enjoy! Getting to 60 is a journey in classic, experiencing the zones, the dungeons on the way. Doing RPG-quests (which are almost all gone in retail), that's the fun. Makes no sense to rush it in the beta just to complain later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its not really meant for pve at all tho. its a extra pvp talent for pvpers, that happen to work for some in pve. Many of these talents are totaly useless in pve. like the necrotic strike</div></div><hr />

Nope. It was never scheduled for 26 June. Whoever told you so lied.</div></div><hr />

Yea, it’s frustrating when it started at 7 and I didn’t get in til almost 10, but that’s a good thing too<br />

The harder that we chernobyled their servers; the better for launch</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been in a couple of betas over the years and I've always felt afterwards that it just spoils the experience for me when it goes live and I do it all over again a 2nd (or in Classic's case who knows how many'th) time.<br />
<br />
Just wait, twiddle your thumbs, and go into WoW with it being an atleast semi-fresh experience, trust me, you'll feel better for it. It's the same reason I wouldn't even consider taking part in a Warcraft Reforged beta, I wouldn't want the 'new' experience to be ruined for me.</div></div><hr />

The reason for the level 5 cap was to keep everyone in just a few zones. You know, in order to properly do a stress test.</div></div><hr />

I see aggression from both those who would defend and only play bfa and those who are upset about not getting into closed beta . For those bfa fans that don't understand those who want to get into classic beta and their only alternative are private servers understand this : people are upset that wow had became nothing more then a display of end game content through loot parading in chat or ah disco with links of achievements that can be bought with gold in mercenary raids and gloating with io.score . For those who are upset for not getting into beta , lets be honest you like me when i got into beta for legion or bfa are doing nothing else then play the game , you are literally eating, breathing there on azeroth and anything else but test the game. I know that things are no longer genuine scaled with the notion of rpg in world of Warcraft , it is an action game because people didn't protest or quit in time when it started to derail from the formula back in MOP or they where replaced faster then old players left. Those people today are in greater numbers then the original wow players , bfa it's their game. They where kind enough to tolerate the elitism of the veterans, they had the patience to invest money into blizzard so that classic could be once again alive. When classic will come alive people will go in separate ways , til then is either other games or private servers . For me its 8.2 and getting some small upgrade on my alts til classic lunches. I wont quit bfa and i will value classic at its full.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol unexpected things never break in computer systems or change based on what you're running the system on I guess.<br />
<br />
They just need to tune some of the PvP talents just like they've capped some at max hp. Less focus on feral and more focus on guardian's shit talent please.</div></div><hr />
