European servers down<br />
A few european servers are down, Blizzard is aware of the problem and working on it.<br />
We’re currently experiencing connection issues with the below realms, and are investigating this with our partners. There’s no ETA at this time. We apologise for the inconvenience and will get back to you with an update as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Affected realms: Aerie Peak, Boulderfist, Eonar, Frostmane, Grim Batol, Jaedenar, Kazzak, Kilrogg, Outland, Ravenholdt, Stonemaul, Tarren Mill, Vek'nilash, Wildhammer<br />
<br />
Our technical team is working diligently to resolve this matter, and we hope to have these realms accessible again as soon as possible.<br />

South Park : Make Love, Not Warcraft<br />
The South Park WoW episode: &quot;Make Love, Not Warcraft&quot; won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)&quot; and I will use this as an excuse to post something else that I forgot to report last week.<br />
<br />
If you didn't see the episode, you can now buy the South Park: The Complete Tenth Season (http://shop.comedycentral.com/South-Park--The-Complete-Tenth-Season--3-Discs--Front-Page_stcVVproductId19108230VVcatId424910VVviewprod.htm) in Comedy Central online shop, but also, if you use the &quot;WARCRAFT&quot; code you will get a 15% discount and free shipping. Bad news is, it won't work outside of the US as far as I know.<br />

I was just thinking the same thing... after the likes of rug rats and all, I really thought people had lost all tastes in cartoons... I now have renewed hope in humanity!<br />

Oooh, close Boubouille, but the Emmys don't take place until next Sunday! It has, however, been nominated (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/59th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards#Outstanding_Animated_Program_.28for_programming_less_than_one_h our.29). We can always hope it wins... though that Robot Chicken episode (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust_for_Puppets) was one of their best...</div></div><hr />

The Emmies you see on TV is not everything, they give out a good deal of other awards to people that they don't think anyone will be interested in watching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Both the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards each present their Creative Arts Emmys at separate &quot;Creative Arts&quot; ceremonies prior to their respective main ceremonies.&quot;</div></div><hr />
