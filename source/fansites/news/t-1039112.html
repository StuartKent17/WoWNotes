<br />
Seeing the Forest for the Talent Trees<br />
We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on our crazy, exciting, and scary talent overhaul, for which we are enormously appreciative. For real and for true. We *want* your feedback on the new talents. That is why we are presenting so much detail so early. While we will continue to iterate on talent specifics, your feedback is an important part of that process. Don’t abstain because you’re convinced that things will change without you. Your input is one of our most important tools for improving the game.<br />
<br />
We have seen a few consistent responses from players concerned or dismissive about the model, so we thought we’d take the opportunity to explain the philosophy behind some of our decisions, to provide a better framework upon which you can continue giving us feedback.<br />
<br />
1. &quot;I have fewer choices.&quot;<br />
This is the big one, and the truth is it is ultimately correct. You will have fewer choices. But you will have more choices that *matter*. One of the important philosophies of game design is that interesting choices are fun. The word ‘interesting’ is key. Choosing between a talent that grants 10% damage and one that grants 5% damage, all else being equal, isn't interesting (unless perhaps you’re a superstar role-player). Choosing between a talent that grants you 5% haste or 5% crit might be interesting, but more than likely there is still a right answer (and like most of us, you'll probably just ask someone else what the answer is.) Choosing between a talent that grants you a root or a snare can be interesting. Which does more damage? Hard to say. Which is better? It depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
This is why we don't have a clear damage, tanking, and healing talent choice every tier. In the case of the old trees, choosing the talent you want from among the talents that don’t interest you isn’t an interesting decision -- it's a multiple choice test, and an easy one at that. Are you Ret? You probably want the damage option. But what if the Ret player had to choose from three healing talents and couldn't sacrifice healing for damage? Now it gets interesting. Worst case scenario is the player just picks one at random because he refuses to heal. However, he has the ability. Maybe he'll use it in some situation. Meanwhile, other players will be happy that they can benefit more from the hybrid nature of the paladin class without having to give up damage to do so.<br />
<br />
2. &quot;There weren't cookie cutter builds.&quot;<br />
You're wrong. Next!<br />
<br />
To be fair, we did manage to engineer most of the Cataclysm talent trees to include a few legitimate choices. These typically occur when you need to spend enough points to get to the next tier of a tree to get the good stuff. Many specs had 1-4 points to spend wherever they want. That's a huge victory compared to pre-Cataclysm talent trees, but ultimately nothing to really brag about.<br />
<br />
It is possible of course to strike a blow for individuality and use a non-cookie cutter build. Ninety-nine percent of the time, these builds are just going to be less effective. The remaining percent of the time, they will eventually become the new cookie-cutter. When players talk about their love of options, I think what they are really saying is they are in love with the idea of having dozens of interesting talents. We just don't think that will ever happen.<br />
<br />
Look, we tried the talent tree model for seven years. We think it’s fundamentally flawed and unfixable. We know some of you have faith in us that someday we’ll eventually replace all of the boring +5% crit talents with interesting talents and give you 80 talent points that you can spend wherever, and that the game will still remain relatively balanced and fun. We greatly appreciate your faith, but we fear it is misplaced. It’s not a matter of coming up with enough fun mechanics, which is challenging but ultimately doable. The problem is the extreme number of combinations. When you have such a gigantic matrix, the chances of having unbeatable synergies, or combinations of talents that just don’t work together is really high. That’s not lazy design. That is recognizing how math works.<br />
<br />
So given that we don’t think it’s humanly possible to have 40-50 fun, interesting and balanced talents in a tree, the alternative is to continue on with bloated trees that have a ton of inconsequential talents that you have to slog through to get to the fun stuff. A lot of you guys have stuck with us for years, continue to play regularly, and still love World of Warcraft. You are the reason we’re still making this game. We think you deserve better, and we think we can do better.<br />
<br />
3. &quot;We'll still have cookie-cutter builds with the new design.&quot;<br />
I am slightly amused by the number of comments that say &quot;The theorycrafters will just math out which is the right talent and we'll all just pick that one.&quot; But the theorycrafters aren’t agreeing with those comments, because they know they won’t be able to.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure, I chose several specs at random and researched their builds. Sure enough, even with the Cataclysm builds today, you see quotes like “spend the last two points wherever you want” or “choose X or Y at your discretion.” It is “easy” (which I put in quotes because theorycrafters devote a lot of time and neurons to it) to determine the value of a DPS talent like Incite or Ignite. It is hard to determine the DPS value of Improved Sprint or Lichborne. Most of the Mists talents are things like the latter. Now there are still some pure throughput (damage, healing, or tanking) talents in the trees. We expect there will sometimes be a right answer as to which talent to take for those roles. On a fight like Baelroc (one boss, no adds), Bladestorm and Shockwave probably aren't competitive with Avatar. We're okay with that, because on Beth'tilac (lots of adds) they definitely can be and it will depend a lot on your play style and the role you have in the fight. However, given that we know a player can only have one of those three talents and that the synergistic effects from those talents with other talents are limited, it is much easier for us to balance say the healing value of Archangel and Divine Star. Despite what you read on the forums, we actually have gotten better at balancing World of Warcraft over the years.<br />
<br />
4. &quot;No rewards for leveling.&quot;<br />
Once upon a time, you got a new talent point every level. That worked okay for a game with 60 levels. It works less well for a game with 90 levels. It probably is totally incomprehensible for a game with 150 levels, should we ever get there. We keep bumping the level cap because frankly it’s fun and we haven’t yet come up with a progression mechanism that will feel quite as good.<br />
<br />
Leveling is pretty fast these days and fairly rewarding, in that you see lots of new content and get gear quickly, which is something we have trouble replicating at max level (though stay tuned for Mists of Pandaria). On top of that, you’ll still get lots of abilities as you level up. Instead of having to click Raging Blow, we’ll just give it to you, because frankly if you skip it, you’re making a mistake (or you’re RPing a Fury warrior who has taken too many blows to the head). There are gaps in getting new abilities, especially at high level, because we don’t want players to have to have four rows of action bars to play their character. Again, that is just the blessing and curse of having a game with so many levels.<br />
<br />
Third, I’ll challenge the notion of just how interesting it is to get that second point in Pain and Suffering or Rule of Law while leveling. Do you really notice that you now kill a creature in 2.9 GCDs instead of 3 GCDs? (But see below for a bit more on this.) There are some game-challenging talents of course, like Shadowform, but as we just discussed, you'll still get those.<br />
<br />
Finally, the reality is that for many players, WoW has become a game focused on max level. Back in the day, leveling a fleet of alts was really compelling gameplay, but for many of the old-timers, there just isn’t a ton of interest in making a second mage or whatever. Hopefully account-level achievements will help with that somewhat, but at the same time, I don’t think it’s realistic to expect all of our long-term players to have thirty or more characters at some point in the future. It’s a fair concern that the new talent system is geared more towards making max level exciting, but that’s also where players tend to spend most of their WoW-playing hours these days. We don’t know yet what we are going to do for players who want to play a monk but just can’t stomach the idea of hitting Hellfire Peninsula one more time, and how we solve the problem when you get a friend to try WoW, only to discover that your pal will need to spend several weeks or months getting up to max level before he or she is ready to join your Arena team or raid group. But these feel like problems we are going to have to solve at some point.<br />
<br />
5. &quot;I like being better than noobs.&quot;<br />
It was surprising and a bit disappointing at how frequently we saw this argument. The players in question fully admit that they don't experiment to find the best build. They accept the cookie cutter spec that is offered from a website, but then they use the fact that they knew the cookie cutter to mock players who don't. Intimate knowledge of game mechanics certainly is and should be a component of skill. But knowing how to Google &quot;4.3 Shadow spec&quot; doesn't automatically make you a better player. Sorry, but I’m just going to dismiss this one as an illegitimate concern.<br />
<br />
6. &quot;The talents are all PvP choices.&quot;<br />
We see this response from players who say “I don’t care about PvP,” or “raid bosses can’t be snared,” or even “I am a solo player, so I don’t need a defensive cooldown.”<br />
<br />
First, a lot of players do care about PvP, and almost every choice in the new talent model will be interesting for them. We are also taking some steps with Mists to encourage more crossover between PvP and PvE as the game once had, so even if you don’t care for PvP now, maybe we can get you interested in the future.<br />
<br />
Second, a lot of raid bosses can’t be snared, but their adds and trash sure can be. We don’t do a lot of Patchwerk fights these days. Crowd control, movement increases, and defensive cooldowns are all an important part of raid encounters these days. They are even a part of dungeon encounters until you overgear the content.<br />
<br />
Now if you're a solo player or a fairly casual raider and you don't often find the need to use crowd control or hit a defensive cooldown, then maybe the choice isn't compelling. But we think that's a problem with the game. I think it’s a fair complaint that our outdoor world creatures have become a little monotonous over the years. Once upon a time, you could choose to take on that camp of gnolls, or you could try and handle the elite ogres, or you might get a patrolling kobold. While we don’t want outdoor leveling to be brutally difficult, that doesn’t mean that every situation needs to be solved with 3 Sinister Strikes. Imagine a cave full of weak spiders. You can choose to AE them all down, use a movement cooldown to get through the cave quickly, use a defensive cooldown to survive the damage, or use your heals to keep you up. When players use their full toolbox of abilities intelligently, they tend to feel good about their character and the game. But it is our responsibility to engineer more of those situations into the world.<br />
<br />
7. &quot;Spec doesn’t matter.&quot;<br />
This is a concern especially for warriors, priests, DKs and the pure classes (those characters who have multiple specs of the same role). What we have concluded is that many players want to choose their spec based on flavor (“I want to be the mage who uses Frost magic”) or rotation (“I like the fast gameplay of the Frost DK”). While the raid buff / debuff matrix and spec utility helps to encourage diversity among groups and discourage raid stacking, it’s also a little lame when the Affliction lock is asked to spec Demonology (against the player’s desire) in order to bring a specific buff. In Mists, we want players to have even more flexibility about which character they want to play. Asking a player to swap from damage to tanking for a couple of fights is acceptable to us. Asking someone to respec from Unholy to Frost just for the debuff is not.<br />
<br />
There will still be some utility in the various specs, but less than we have today. You should pick a spec because you like the rotation or the kit. Fire is about crit, Hot Streak, and Ignite. Frost is about Shatter combos and the Water Elemental. Arcane is about mana management and clearing Arcane Blast stacks.<br />
<br />
8. “It must be new to be good.”<br />
This is a tricky one. Specifically, the warlock and druid trees include a lot of new talent ideas simply because we felt like those classes needed them. While we want to make an effort to add some new mechanics every expansion just to keep things fresh, we don’t want to arbitrarily replace fun talents that have stood the test of time just in the name of change for change’s sake. Bladestorm is fun. Body and Soul is fun. Shadowstep is fun.<br />
<br />
From a designer’s perspective, the half-life of a new spell or talent idea is fleetingly short. You know how when you buy a new car and drive it off the lot it immediately loses a huge chunk of its value? New game ideas are like that. Seeing something brand new is super exhilarating, but that thrill just doesn’t last. I suspect even by the time Mists launches, we will see a lot of comments along the lines of “When are druids going to get something new? We haven’t seen any new ideas since November!”<br />
<br />
It isn’t our goal to come up with 18 new talents for every class. We want to come up with 18 fun talents, and that’s going to mean a mix of old and new. Try not to confuse “shiny” with “good,” and we’ll try on our end not to fall into that trap as well.<br />
<br />
9. “You overhaul talents every expansion. Please leave well enough alone.”<br />
This is another tricky issue, because neither extreme (stagnation versus constant design churn) is appealing, and every individual player (and designer!) has a different definition of where those extremes lie. We changed talent trees in Cataclysm to try and fix some of the underlying problems the talent design had since its inception. We actually considered going to the Mists model for Cataclysm, but we were worried that the change would be too shocking to players, so we went with a more restrained design first. As often happens with compromises, it didn’t fix the underlying problems. Our hope is that this new design solves them once and for all. That isn’t a promise to not change talents for 6.0, 7.0, and beyond. But we hope that an overhaul this drastic isn’t necessary again for a long time to come.<br />
MMOs are inherently living designs that are going to change over time. This is particularly true of subscription models, where players rightly expect to see something for their monthly payment. We don’t think it’s fair to cling to designs that aren’t working just because that’s the design we shipped with. As we have discussed a great deal lately, we will try to limit our big design changes to new expansions, but it’s just not in our DNA to leave something at a B- level if we think we can make it A+.<br />
<br />
10. “You’ve got your minds made up and don’t care about what we think.”<br />
You’re wrong. Next!<br />
<br />
As I have said a million times, good games (maybe good anything) can’t be designed by popular vote. Our design feedback process is about making informed decisions. The developers will make the decisions we feel are right for the game, but we’ll do that armed with the feedback from players about what is fun and not fun for them. If you want to provide the best feedback possible, try to be succinct (we get a lot of feedback), try to be specific (why don’t you like something), and don’t assume you speak for everyone (game design, like art, is often subjective). Don’t get upset if we don’t implement your idea -- that’s just not a realistic expectation. Don’t confuse the echo chamber phenomenon that can occur in forum discussions for consensus. Most importantly, try to remember what will be fun for everyone, and not just your character.<br />
<br />
One more thing to keep in mind: Playing with the new talent system in-game is really different from choosing talents on “paper.” Some of the decisions we made didn’t come about until we could get into the game and see how leveling and playing actually felt. Once we’re in alpha, many of you guys will be able to give us some more concrete feedback. We understand that, and we’re pushing for doing that just as soon as we can. In the meantime, enjoy the Hour of Twilight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">antonatsis</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I have fewer choices.&quot;<br />
This is the big one, and the truth is it is ultimately correct. You will have fewer choices. But you will have more choices that *matter*. One of the important philosophies of game design is that interesting choices are fun. The word ‘interesting’ is key. Choosing between a talent that grants 10% damage and one that grants 5% damage, all else being equal, isn't interesting (unless perhaps you’re a superstar role-player). Choosing between a talent that grants you 5% haste or 5% crit might be interesting, but more than likely there is still a right answer (and like most of us, you'll probably just ask someone else what the answer is.) Choosing between a talent that grants you a root or a snare can be interesting. Which does more damage? Hard to say. Which is better? It depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
This is why we don't have a clear damage, tanking, and healing talent choice every tier. In the case of the old trees, choosing the talent you want from among the talents that don’t interest you isn’t an interesting decision -- it's a multiple choice test, and an easy one at that. Are you Ret? You probably want the damage option. But what if the Ret player had to choose from three healing talents and couldn't sacrifice healing for damage? Now it gets interesting. Worst case scenario is the player just picks one at random because he refuses to heal. However, he has the ability. Maybe he'll use it in some situation. Meanwhile, other players will be happy that they can benefit more from the hybrid nature of the paladin class without having to give up damage to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember the people that were routing the new talents giving numbers on how many billions of specs you will have in the new talent tree...:P<br />
with mathematical equations and the like(put equation cause i don't know any better English word for what i wanted to say :P )</div></div><hr />

Guildy: Really?<br />
Me: Yep. You pick the suitable ones per fight. <br />
Guildy: Then it's EVEN MORE pointless! They should just give us ALL of them in one go.<br />
<br />
I can see why Blizz have responded, because there's a lot of whiners who hate change, but I've probably used all these arguments already. He won't be happy until there's a talent at every tier that increased damage by 20%... Best for them just to ignore these types as they can't be reasoned with. Hate on it all you want but Blizz are right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, because pvp in wow is so poorly balanced it's not even worth playing anymore<br />
<br />
&quot;anymore&quot; indicates that there was a time WoW PvP was ever remotely close to balanced. Vanilla and TBC PvP balance was beyond awful. Wrath was alright in certain seasons (not the first few).<br />
<br />

<br />
You must not read the forums often. Go look on the Bluetracker, there are like 3 threads in the last month about it alone. There are threads all the time on the official forums from the casual playerbase who like seeing all the content and leveling faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This simply isn't true. My shaman for example has a bunch of totems I will never use, and a cooldown I've had for years. It's the same for almost all other classes too. None of the choices (with the exception of a few) &quot;matter&quot;. TOTALLY dreadful idea. We went from like 60 talent points, to 40 and now 6 ... How is this more choice? Dreadful!</div></div><hr />

The new talents for Resto Shaman at least look awful.<br />
Crowd control, movement increases, and defensive cooldowns are all an important part of raid encounters these days.Sure it'd be cool if we had to choose between those, but when we have to choose between snare protection for self, snare protection for others or silence protection, absolutely none of those have any use for PVE whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

You can write up all the theorycrafting mages need on a napkin while if your say a rogue or a hunter you end up writing a dissertation, yet mages can easily outperform other classes that require magnitudes more of study to learn properly. Perhaps their goal is to make every class like this, which I think sends us in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This simply isn't true. My shaman for example has a bunch of totems I will never use, and a cooldown I've had for years. It's the same for almost all other classes too. None of the choices (with the exception of a few) &quot;matter&quot;. TOTALLY dreadful idea. We went from like 60 talent points, to 40 and now 6 ... How is this more choice? Dreadful!<br />
<br />
Did you read what he said? He agreed, you are getting less choices. You are getting more that matter.<br />
<br />
As an example, it's like if I asked what sport you wanted to play and had you pick from 50 different types and colors of American football. On the other hand, I have you pick between 5 balls that are actually different: soccer, volleyball, etc.<br />
<br />
Please show me in the Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, or even Cataclysm talent trees where you have a level of meaningful choice that is even remotely close to the ones shown in the more complete talent trees (not Shaman) like Warlocks, Druids, Priests, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
This might be true for DPS, but not at all for healers or tanks. Want more mana as Resto Shaman? Go Telluric Currents and Elemental Precision. Want more mobility? Go for Ancestral Swiftness. There's a lot of movement and no real cookie cutter for us. The new talents for Resto Shaman at least look awful.Sure it'd be cool if we had to choose between those, but when we have to choose between snare protection for self, snare protection for others or silence protection, absolutely none of those have any use for PVE whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Shaman are clearly not even started for Mists.<br />
<br />
If you're a:<br />
Death Knight<br />
Hunter<br />
Rogue<br />
Shaman<br />
Paladin<br />
Tank (of any class)<br />
<br />
I'd definitely wait before making judgement. Your classes/specs are pre-alpha and shouldn't have even been released in the talent calculator in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Honestly is annoying. Blizzard are trying to get rid of cookie cutter builds. But the problems with maxing is there will be a max, and that will become a cookie cutter. IF you give a choice and one is better for DPS then you choose it, end of and that will happen with this. <br />
<br />
Every single player worth there salt will play with the choice that make there character produce the best, that will be the cookie cutter. <br />

The problem is that talent trees do not work in World of Warcraft as the level cap expands. They cannot continue to give players more and more and more abilities or everyone will have 120 buttons and it will just be wonky as hell. Same with talents.<br />
<br />
See this:<br />
Once upon a time, you got a new talent point every level. That worked okay for a game with 60 levels. It works less well for a game with 90 levels. It probably is totally incomprehensible for a game with 150 levels, should we ever get there.</div></div><hr />

Since Vanilla, there have been an array of changes that have come to the game over the years. Throughout all these changes, I have been fine and in fact for most of the changes to the abilities, talents, and class designs. As an unholy/Blood Dk, an Enhancement/Restoration Shaman, and a Combat/Assassination Rogue, I have had my classes buffed/nerfed plenty of times, and I'm no stranger to getting a little upset over these changes. Over time, I simply deal with them and move on, learning how to accept the changes over time. I think the message blizzard is trying to send with this total overhaul of the talent design, though, might be a step backwards. The whole point of this new system is that it's taking certain talents that made a certain class' spec unique and purely designed for it and make it readily available to everyone. Further more, the ability players have to benefit from certain talents in their current talent tree selections are currently gone. I'm not opposed to fans giving feedback at all. In fact, if I had a chance to right now, I'd even give blizz a thought or two about these changes. However, I think that as members of the WoW community, we should go ahead and hold all reservations of what we think about the changes until we get a lot closer to the final product. Who knows? There could be a very big overhaul done to what we see right now, and a lot of the abilities that we aren't seeing, or we don't like, will be placed into the game or taken out. Let's just hold off our judgement until it gets closer to the release date. For all we know, we might all be pleasantly surprised. :)</div></div><hr />

You're comparing them with other MMORPGs that are just launching and aren't running into a talent/spell inflation issue due to the game being running for so long.<br />
<br />
<br />

Currently there are around 3 cookie cutter builds for each class and if you don't use them, you're not playing well.<br />

Because they're critical to your class and the choices will change a lot according to situation. They'll be just as important as always.<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter how much they try they can't hide the fact that they've used the same template for Diablo 3 and WoW.<br />

Are you seriously attempting to suggest that adding 2 new talents to each tree (for 5 new levels) would cost them less than redesigning the entire talent system and every spec?<br />

Exactly. I Definately don't know why someone would bother mentioning Rift in the case of balancing trees. One of the most annoying things is having to change your spec weekly as they 'balance' out the specs. If you want to be competitive, you have to learn a new play style every time the talents even slightly change as something else is now max dps spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please dont mock us, there are already forums about exact specs players should choose from merely based off of the talent tree. Sure depending on the encounters that come up and the numbers behind the players and the gear will change them. But to say there is no more cookie cutters builds outrageous. There always will be. There is no way to get around them unless no matter what talent you choose from, the dps/healing/threat will always be the same. On elitist jerks for the rogue community they will spend hours on a test dummy just to test out a .05% gain. Compile data and as a community make sure that the current proposed build is correct.

<br />
<br />
Have you looked at the new talent trees? The finished ones offer more choice than ever.<br />
<br />
The hybrid trees look far from &quot;choicy&quot;. In fact, you barely get any choices at all.<br />
Take druids for example. Then pick balance and tell me where you see choices.<br />
Some talents are very specific to either bear or cat, I reckon priests, paladins, and warriors have a similar issue.<br />
<br />
The only ones getting real &quot;choices&quot; are the warlocks, pages and rogues.<br />

I would have kind of hoped that the talen trees at least &quot;change&quot; if you take a different specialization, but they don't :(</div></div><hr />

Way to not get it. The talents are not done, so all those forums you are talking about are working on incorrect and incomplete data. Further, GC even says that there might be builds that are better for a specific given fight. But overall there should not be an &quot;always best&quot; build. In fact, the system as they have proposed it means that for all but the bleeding edge progression guilds, spec will matter far less than it does now when talking about your overall performance. So you could go against what is commonly accepted as the &quot;best&quot; build for that fight and not lose so much that you are dragging the rest of the raid down.</div></div><hr />

Rift has the worst balancing of any game I've ever played. So no, Rift can't balance 224 combinations which is why no-one else is trying to.<br />

Blizzard are a corps of designers that take the time to do these little water cooler talks, communicate their ethos and philosophy, and genuinely engage their player-base. As an appeal to fanboys, when have you heard Bioware (as an example) say, &quot;So, let's shoot the shit with you about Dragon Age 2 and explain where we're at and talk about player feedback&quot;? They haven't because they probably don't have the capability to interact with it's player-base in the same way, but, regardless they just don't go out of their way to engage that base like Blizzard does. No one does. This is why Blizzard have been the cream of the crop (in terms of game developers) for the past decade, arguably since the late 90's. Please don't misunderstand, I love Bioware. My point is that no big box developer does what Blizzard does for it's community, at least not to this extent. <br />
<br />
I personally love the new talent system. The amount of possible hybridization is staggering to view across all the classes.

This is the big one, and the truth is it is ultimately correct. You will have fewer choices. But you will have more choices that *matter*. One of the important philosophies of game design is that interesting choices are fun. The word ‘interesting’ is key. Choosing between a talent that grants 10% damage and one that grants 5% damage, all else being equal, isn't interesting (unless perhaps you’re a superstar role-player). Choosing between a talent that grants you 5% haste or 5% crit might be interesting, but more than likely there is still a right answer (and like most of us, you'll probably just ask someone else what the answer is.) Choosing between a talent that grants you a root or a snare can be interesting. Which does more damage? Hard to say. Which is better? It depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
This is why we don't have a clear damage, tanking, and healing talent choice every tier. In the case of the old trees, choosing the talent you want from among the talents that don’t interest you isn’t an interesting decision -- it's a multiple choice test, and an easy one at that. Are you Ret? You probably want the damage option. But what if the Ret player had to choose from three healing talents and couldn't sacrifice healing for damage? Now it gets interesting. Worst case scenario is the player just picks one at random because he refuses to heal. However, he has the ability. Maybe he'll use it in some situation. Meanwhile, other players will be happy that they can benefit more from the hybrid nature of the paladin class without having to give up damage to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember the people that were routing the new talents giving numbers on how many billions of specs you will have in the new talent tree...:P<br />
with mathematical equations and the like(put equation cause i don't know any better English word for what i wanted to say :P )<br />
<br />
It's not about the number of raw permutations, it's about what you have to balance any one ability against. If you look at the choices, each tier pretty much follows a theme. So you're picking things like which of the movement enhancers you want. You don't have to balance that against which of the CC abilities you want, because there's little if any synergy between them.</div></div><hr />

This is the big one, and the truth is it is ultimately correct. You will have fewer choices. But you will have more choices that *matter*<br />
<br />
People will have more choices that matter to the devs, not the player. Every time I read one of GC posts, I dislike him even more.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard are a corps of designers that take the time to do these little water cooler talks, communicate their ethos and philosophy, and genuinely engage their player-base. As an appeal to fanboys, when have you heard Bioware (as an example) say, &quot;So, let's shoot the shit with you about Dragon Age 2 and explain where we're at and talk about player feedback&quot;? They haven't because they probably don't have the capability to interact with it's player-base in the same way, but, regardless they just don't go out of their way to engage that base like Blizzard does. No one does. This is why Blizzard have been the cream of the crop (in terms of game developers) for the past decade, arguably since the late 90's. Please don't misunderstand, I love Bioware. My point is that no big box developer does what Blizzard does for it's community, at least not to this extent. <br />
<br />
I personally love the new talent system. The amount of possible hybridization is staggering to view across all the classes. I've been playing my Warrior since 1.1 and it's incredible to look back over the past 7 years and see just how much this game has changed, for the better, imho.<br />

I think it's less about the fact the GC is talking about how the dev process is going, and more about the way he said it. If I had to put my finger on it, what irks me the most about GC's post is the fact that he uses such a confrontational tone at times.</div></div><hr />

I suppose it's how you look at what is a 'waste of effort' and what isn't. I think, from Blizzard's perspective, the more feedback they get regardless of source can never hurt. I would agree with you that since WotLK the &quot;vocal minority&quot; have become more and more jaded over the years, but I think there is an unaccounted for group that does read these things and never posts replys about them.

<br />
Because most people like to pvp and pve as the same spec (minor talent changes not withstanding). I personally always pvp'd as an unholy DK, because that's the spec I liked playing. When unholy became utterly useless in pvp I simply stopped pvp'ing. Same problem with having a whole new 'spec' for pvp, what if you don't like that spec?</div></div><hr />

Take druids for example. Then pick balance and tell me where you see choices.<br />
Some talents are very specific to either bear or cat, I reckon priests, paladins, and warriors have a similar issue.<br />
<br />
The only ones getting real &quot;choices&quot; are the warlocks, pages and rogues.<br />
<br />
I would have kind of hoped that the talen trees at least &quot;change&quot; if you take a different specialization, but they don't :(#<br />
<br />
as a druid I do not see any talent being a clear cut choice for Balance. The fact that some of the abilities change you to another form are no indication that they are for a &quot;feral spec&quot;. Bear hug is a nice CC ability that transform you in a bear simply cause it make sense<br />
<br />
I would like you to consider the fact that you do not see the choices because the one you see and the one you choose from what you see are already the ones that you identified good for your playstyle and so you do not really see the &quot;other choices&quot;.<br />
<br />
You play in a way that makes you already know what you want, but I'm confident that once in the game and once you try out first hand some abilities you may understand that nothing is as clear cut as you think they are now :)</div></div><hr />

I think posts like this are a staple of the decaying community. When the developer feels like they have to defend their design choices against a community that is holding a mutiny against them, there's certainly an issue. I believe this whole battle the naysayers started with GC's little table flip comment and has gone into a full bore gloves off slugfest. They come up with a design, the community tells them to leave things alone or negatively responds, and then Blizzard fires back with a jab at the community while attempting to justify the design decision.

Do you really think the tl;dr posts on MMO-Champ and Official Forums are a large representation of the players quitting? You have got to be out of your mind. People who don't even know MMO-Champ exists or have ever logged onto the forums are the people who are quitting. Those people are simply getting tired of the game. Those are the people who don't click any of the links on the launcher, they just play the game to have fun. What makes you think the theorycrafters and the &quot;this game is too hard!&quot;/&quot;this game is too easy&quot; are the throngs that are leaving WoW? They're just the ones who think the whole community cares about it.<br />
<br />
No amount of tug-of-war with the community is going to convince people to keep playing. The game has risen in its popularity and has reached the pinnacle people are going to leave. It will happen with Warcraft, then SWTOR, then Diablo, and to every game from now until eternity. That's how media works, it is created, marketed, consumed, and 10 years later someone will do it again and it will be &quot;fresh&quot; to the new generations and come back.</div></div><hr />

I do not see it like that to be honest. They're simply being transparent, to me the post of GC does not seems of the arguing type. Pardon me it is possible that being non english native makes me blind to some detail in the writing style but the only thing I see from my point of view is transparency on design decision and on how they handle feedback and some feedback on the feedback itself they often receive in that cauldron of hate that is the official forums (yo, dawg!)<br />
<br />
As far as I can see is the community that first say &quot;booh hoo there're no communication from the devs ever&quot; then when they decide to share a design philosophy is &quot;booh hoo blizzard is only giving us excuses&quot; <br />
<br />
The reality is that the only communication the community would like to hear is: &quot;*bow* to you my lords here we are doing as you please does not matter what we think or would like to do, here's all the change as you requested&quot; and being trated like a game designer.<br />
Unfortunately it does not, and never will work this way, not only with Blizzard but for every company, gaming one or not</div></div><hr />

The reasoning behind the whole &quot;customer is always right&quot; mindset is that for every person who complains, there are dozens more who have the same issue but instead of bringing it up, just take their business elsewhere. That's customer service 101. Yes, customers might be idiots, but there are a lot of idiots, and being rude or patronizing to them loses you business 100% of the time.<br />

Remember the &quot;I'm quitting&quot; threads early on in Cata? Remember the fan response to those? &quot;You're a vocal minority, no one cares, Cata is doing great, blah blah blah.&quot; Same response as now. Yet nearly 2 MILLION subscribers were lost. There weren't 2 million &quot;I quit&quot; threads or posts, but each one represented thousands of people. Now think about how many &quot;these talents suck&quot; and &quot;I'm quitting over MoP&quot; threads are popping up. For each and every one of those, several thousand people are quitting with them.

But it does make for great internet! ;D To your point, I agree and I don't. I agree with your take on the forum crowd to some degree. You have little camps that pop up that can be categorized as either 'with blizzard' or 'not with blizzard', but I think that's the case for any discussion where more than two people are involved. They'll never be able to please the latter camp, but I don't think that's their goal. I think their goal is to make a great game the best way they can and any feedback, even if it is from the unruly rabble, will help.<br />
<br />
So, It seems to me that Blizz knows how ... passionate ... some of their player-base is. But I think they know what I know and that's that these people, however Jaded and unruly they are acting are only acting that way because they -do- care. I think the perception from people that GC has a &quot;confrontational tone&quot; is all about perspective. I think he sounds honest and to the point. He doesn't use airy metaphors and amorphous terminology to placate his audience. He knows we're a group of walking meme impersonators and internet junkies. I wouldn't confuse &quot;casual personality&quot; with &quot;confrontational&quot;, though, to another posters comment.</div></div><hr />

This game had me bored and limited when I had no other decent MMO or RPG to go to, they are going to wait till competition starts threatening them to make some real innovative changes to the game to actually do them. This in some sense only pisses me off more its like the whole scenario &quot;where were you when I needed you&quot; but they claim to be riding in with all my cures as the hero in this with all the great stuff to offer. I am sick of tab targeting gameplay I like more mouse oriented gameplay -- mouse to turn by default, crosshair-style, only two mouse buttons for side movement freeing space, backstepping actually is meaningful, not having to target enemies with tab or clicking on them, but just by looking at them or automatically hitting those who can be hit by melee first... for the RP side of players or just for fun being able to do a single target attack animation whenever. I know this game will likely never have projectile dodging and never expect it, but it would be nice if they ever considered this for their game. But the overlaying point is if they are going to rock up the gameplay changes like I have listed, then all this stuff they are finally doing with MoP should've came way earlier (BTW monks are playing more like what other games are doing/going to do, not sure why they didn't do this for other classes).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;too hard&quot; / &quot;too easy&quot; folks are hardly the only people who are unhappy with the announced talents. I wish fans would stop using the &quot;tired of the game&quot; line. No, people are absolutely NOT leaving just because they're tired of the game. They're leaving because the quality has gone down the toilet. The drop was immediate and dramatic with the release of Cata in the US and Europe, while WotLK kept subs growing in China. Cata was released in China half a year later and met with the exact same dramatic drop in subs. The sub loss is clearly, identifiably, objectively (as in, it's not &quot;opinion&quot;) due to Blizzard's own design choices.<br />
<br />
I participated in the Cata beta. Hundreds of us voiced opinions which were contrary to their design decisions. We said healing wasn't nearly as fun, that Holy Power wasn't well-thought or well-implemented, that leveling was far too quick, that dungeons were far too slow, that Tol Barad was a disaster... basically every complaint that was voiced on live. GC responded that we &quot;weren't being helpful&quot; and STOPPED POSTING on the Beta forums. Now we're seeing the exact same thing with MoP design choices, even before beta. They are coming up with a talent system that a lot of people are unhappy with. Instead of dealing with this vocal not-a-minority, he's doing the same &quot;you're wrong - la la la, I can't hear you&quot; thing he did during the Cata beta. It'll have the same result: another few million subs lost.</div></div><hr />

Only the most egregious imbalanced synergies will be actively fix. You can also have any 5 builds available at any given time!Blizzard: We keep narrowing the talent trees down, but we still can't keep them balanced. So we're removing talent trees, and we'll give you a handful of ability choices and that will be your class. We grudingly let you swap between two roles, but only because we had to address the deficiency of tanks. Ever since Morhaime praised the Call of Duty unlock system, did I realize that Activision's ethos is corrupting the design culture in Blizzard. One of the great things about MMOs was the flexibility and diversity of choices available, and it encouraged the community to actively balance and research and test different combinations. The dialogue made the community better! The game is rapidly descending in a 2012 version of Gauntlet. Pick you class, here's your abilites, go play. The turning point was when they gave up on the new DeathKnight talent schools... being able to tank and dps as blood, unholy, and frost allowed for some true choice and flavor. That should ahve been the future of talent design, not this console design logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is one of the dumbest things I've read recently. Of course they think they are right. Thats why they are making these changes. They are trying to explain to us why they think that, and one of the reasons for them to do that is because they care what we think. You can defend your position and think you are right while still being concerned with the other persons point of view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm excited about the lock trees, but personally I'm not seeing a lot of real choice with them, either. I personally am considering only a handful of builds in PvE, 2 to be precise. And they are the same across the trees as well. I have one set that I plan to use &quot;all the time,&quot; and another set that I plan to use in cases where my pet is a liability and I want to use Grimiore of Sacrifice. PvP has a lot more wiggle-room, but I'll leave that to a PvPer to talk about.<br />
<br />
The difference between old and new, is my handful of builds is likely different then somebody else's handful of builds, and rather then one of us being emperically wrong or right, we just have a difference in opinion of how we like our extras. Our core abilities remain the same and balanced, and instead of putting the work of fine tuning our own numbers on our back, they are setting them where they want them, and letting us squabble about utility instead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Last DJ</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I participated in the Cata beta. Hundreds of us voiced opinions which were contrary to their design decisions. We said healing wasn't nearly as fun, that Holy Power wasn't well-thought or well-implemented, that leveling was far too quick, that dungeons were far too slow, that Tol Barad was a disaster... basically every complaint that was voiced on live. GC responded that we &quot;weren't being helpful&quot; and STOPPED POSTING on the Beta forums. <br />
<br />
I was in the Cata beta, and the Wrath beta as well. They were night and day compared to one another. It seemed like the Wrath beta was much more slow to invite masses of players, instead sampling from a smaller group who were there to actually play test, and not treat it like a free preview. The blues were helpful and the players constructive, and the DK forums were simply awash with input, most of which was responded to in some way or tested out. (Believe it or not, my husband was one of the Unholy DKs who started suggesting that Unholy, as a master of ghouls, get a permanent ghoul for themselves.) Me, I spent half my time in the DK forums (where I laugh about just how broken beta Blood DKs were - you think their self-healing now was absurd? Unlimited number of bloodworms spawning on AUTO ATTACKS mwahahaha) and staring glumly at the shaman forums, where all the enhancement players were wringing their hair and screaming about how DKs were going to be benching enh shamans everywhere.<br />
<br />
No matter what the goddamn expansion, the sky is always falling for shamans. Christ.<br />
<br />
Anyway. The Wrath beta was fun, and enjoyable, and minus that little Ret with the GOD SWITCH flipped on snafu, an overall success. Then came Cata. Suddenly their subs had ballooned to 12 million, Wrath was a rousing success ... aaaaaaaaand it all went straight to their heads. The Cata beta was shit. Utter shit. They started mass-inviting before things were even ready for a beta release, and most of these people weren't interested in submitting bugs or offering critique. They were there to get a free preview. The blues, especially Ghostcrawler, were very condescending and smug in a very &quot;my shit don't stink a'cause I got 12 million subscribers whaaaaaaaat?&quot; fashion. If suggestions weren't worded with 95% ass-kissing and hand-holding, GC or another blue would flop out the big blue Blizzard e-peen and start threatening to revoke the poster's beta status for &quot;trolling&quot; and &quot;being unhelpful&quot;. What happened when Cata was released? Subs took a nosedive. Not surprising, given that they didn't listen to any of the suggestions - and how could they, when they started inviting hundreds of players hand over fist when the game was a week out of beta from the alpha. Half of the posts on the forums were complaints about bugs - not bug reports, actual complaints, and the other half were WHAT SHOULD THE WORGEN DANCE BE?<br />
<br />
Given that they're handing out MoP keys to everyone with one of those goddamn obnoxious Tyrael's Chargers, I suspect the MoP beta will be no different, unless they sorely learned their lesson about being arrogant pillocks when it comes to the testing phase of their game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frozen Death Knight</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think posts like this are a staple of the decaying community. When the developer feels like they have to defend their design choices against a community that is holding a mutiny against them, there's certainly an issue. I believe this whole battle the naysayers started with GC's little table flip comment and has gone into a full bore gloves off slugfest. They come up with a design, the community tells them to leave things alone or negatively responds, and then Blizzard fires back with a jab at the community while attempting to justify the design decision. To me it just seems unnecessary.<br />
<br />
I may not agree with everything Blizzard have said regarding their changes over the years, but I can certainly say that I prefer a game developer that sticks to their guns than catering to every concern that pops up from a game community, regardless of how many agree with those concerns or not. Player feedback is always great, but if the developers do not have a strong vision to drive this game forward, and let the players decide, it will in turn create a huge mess, especially when this gaming community is so diverse as it is.<br />
<br />
You may not agree with me on this point, but Blizzard have listened a lot to the community, and probably a bit too much, sometimes. They try too much to please a huge chunk of the playerbase and I believe strongly that if players did not have the influence it has had over the development of this game, things would have been a bit different regarding certain parts of the game, right now.</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to see how it all plays out. Blizzard, as a developer, have to take a hard stance on some changes, that despite player worries, they feel is the right thing to do with the game. The problem comes when they make those hard stances on the wrong issues, or underestimate the player's concerns. Making Heroic dungeons that are challenging and a effort(at least when first implemented) isn't compatible with the Insta-Queue culture. Tol Barad was a joke. Healing was unrewarding and frustating. Then, as if these weren't active design choices made by Blizzard themselves, they basically told us to &quot;man up&quot; before watching the millions flock from the game then changing their minds. A lot of the talent change debate, including myself, is that we are sick of change because Ghostcrawler has a problem with&quot;cookie-cutter&quot; builds, but Blizzard have to tread carefully because underestimating player concerns when they are changing the fundementals of our characters could backfire inanother drastic sub loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The true failure of the current talent trees are the talents that provide only part of something. A perfect example is Balance of Power in the balance druid tree. Sure, I'd like 100% of my spirit to go to spell hit rating. What isn't useful is to have 50% of my spirit go to hit. So I basically have to always spend 2 points because almost on one will pick 1/2 of those talents. That reduces the number of points we can spend elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Same type of deal with frost dk talent Nerves of Cold Steel, which grants hit for dual wield. If I am dual wield, I will always pick 3/3. I can't think of a scenario where you wouldn't have all 3. If they are mandatory, make it a baseline talent of 1/1 with full power when you select it.<br />
<br />
It is these types of wasted talent points that are very disappointing.</div></div><hr />

Why are they selling me something I've already purchased? I play a prot warrior, and as many prot warriors do, I've taken shockwave as a talent. It's situationally useful in PVE, great in PVP, but more importantly it's been in the game for quite some time now. My understanding is that, under the new system, I will now lose shockwave until I purchase the expansion and level up to 90. So my primary incentive to buy MoP isn't to get new powers or experience new content, it's to get back something I feel I've already paid for. That's the major sticking point on the talent changes for me, and thankfully it doesn't apply to every class. It's my hope that shockwave and bladestorm are there as placemarkers until new powers are revealed, becase bumping existing powers up to level 90 as new &quot;talents&quot; is flat out idiotic. That's not a balancing issue. That's holding your character hostage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">straazz</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my personal opinion about this blue post: about frikkin time. they're only trying to improve the game. they tried it with cataclysm, and it was at best a moderate success. at least there was LESS passives in talent trees, but nowhere near none. but my point, and my question to everyone who reads this: didn't it get better?i think, as objectively as the blue post train of thought was, that we, the players, should let the game developers do what they are in fact hired to do, and try to make the game better for everyone. i have not, and will not, question their dedication to this for even a second.but, lets be realistic. this talent calc is very much a work-in-progress deal. if in the end it turns out it doesn't do what it's supposed to do, then it's back to the old drawing board. i, however, have high hopes.as a final remark, what would be nice is some sort of combination of the current system, and the new system. that way we can please those who want to take advantage of hybrid classes, as well as those who take pride in their current talent specs, making the spec itself something that will separate the good players from the not so good, so to speak.anyway, back to farming mog weapons.tata</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: This is the big one, and the truth is it is ultimately correct. You will have fewer choices. But you will have more choices that *matter*. One of the important philosophies of game design is that interesting choices are fun.<br />
Quantity (not quality) is more important than you think. Not the best example but 10 dungeons which take only 45 minutes to complete are more fun than 5 dungeons which take 1.5 hours. 10 dungeons offer simply more diversity than 5.</div></div><hr />

I think, as a balancing, issue they took out any already existing abilities that meet their criteria for the new talents. It does look like, to some classes, that they are being short changed. Then there is Blizzard assuming that most of us will buy the xpac anyway, so the fuss from people who have something like Bladestorm taken off them will be minimal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doombringer</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the overall plan for MoP talents. That said, the &quot;design churn&quot; remains in effect. I continually get the impression that many (not all) changes are being made more by designer hubris (or desire) than what is precisely &quot;needed.&quot; In other words, &quot;is it broken? should it be fixed?&quot; Are the designers, at times, setting out by saying &quot;we think Hunters need to play differently so we're going to change them&quot; -- despite there being no call from the community for a change, or an uproar about the class being &quot;boring&quot; or otherwise disliked? Balance changes aside, is how the class plays really a target for drastic change?<br />
<br />
Or tanking. Is tanking broken? Do tanks feel bored in their duty? I haven't seen a lot of talk about it. If Blizzard has, then good, they have data... but if not, then they are simply making a change to do what precisely? Add more arbitrary button-pushing and &quot;challenge&quot; to the game? Is it truly challenge? Should they leave well enough alone?<br />
<br />
The healer-revamp in Cataclysm. Were healers clamoring and caterwauling because of the &quot;Wrath design&quot; and the designers swooped in to make a much-desired change? Or did the design team sit down and simply decide &quot;we're going to change this&quot; ...? That sort of design decision may work in a non-subscription game (where players pretty much buy the box once and then have to live with whatever decisions the designers made)... but in an MMO, you have to keep people happy and paying. What may seem like &quot;good design&quot; or a &quot;good change&quot; to a bunch of developers in a darkened room may not exactly be what the players are calling for. And yet, they continue doing this.<br />
<br />
Again, some changes are great. But others... ehhhh. Did Paladins really need a combo-point system? Did Hunters need Focus? Does tanking need to be turned on its head? Was the difficulty ramp up at the beginning of Cata really needed? Evidently not, as much of it was nerfed/reverted shortly thereafter... yet it was another example of designers thinking they should fix what isn't precisely broken, and seeming to lose the pulse of the player community.</div></div><hr />

The reasoning behind the whole &quot;customer is always right&quot; mindset is that for every person who complains, there are dozens more who have the same issue but instead of bringing it up, just take their business elsewhere. That's customer service 101. Yes, customers might be idiots, but there are a lot of idiots, and being rude or patronizing to them loses you business 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Remember the &quot;I'm quitting&quot; threads early on in Cata? Remember the fan response to those? &quot;You're a vocal minority, no one cares, Cata is doing great, blah blah blah.&quot; Same response as now. Yet nearly 2 MILLION subscribers were lost. There weren't 2 million &quot;I quit&quot; threads or posts, but each one represented thousands of people. Now think about how many &quot;these talents suck&quot; and &quot;I'm quitting over MoP&quot; threads are popping up. For each and every one of those, several thousand people are quitting with them. Vocal minority, my ass.<br />

Seeing that GC still has a job somehow I bet he's trying to see how far he can tank the new expansion before it even goes live. He's proved to be an incompetent game designer and should have been fired a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

What did you think about Tol Barad at the start of the xpac then? Blizzard have assumed this exact manner before, at the start of Cataclysm, and they lost millions of subs. Not saying they are linked, but those &quot;hard&quot; Heroics sure did last. I'm not saying changing the talents is all doom and gloom,but Blizzard have to make sure MoP ships with the new system in place in a manner that pisses of the least possible amount of players.

It's admittedly QQ on my end, but this is actually a dealbreaker for me on the expansion. The talent changes otherwise seem all sound and fury, signifying nothing. I gain some things. I lose some things. But with shockwave and bladestorm, it just fees like Blizzard is selling me back the hood ornament they ripped off the car I've already paid for. It feels similar with War Banner. Seriously, Blizzard, just leave the skull banner and we're happy with being able to give a mini-bloodlust buff, but rolling Challenging Shout and Demoralizing Shout into a level 87 power and selling it as something new and shiny is more than a little bit annoying. The icon on those two banners may as well be a middle finger.</div></div><hr />

Guildy: New talent system sucks. Most of them are only useful on one fight.<br />

Guildy: Really?<br />
Me: Yep. You pick the suitable ones per fight. <br />
Guildy: Then it's EVEN MORE pointless! They should just give us ALL of them in one go.<br />

I can see why Blizz have responded, because there's a lot of whiners who hate change, but I've probably used all these arguments already. He won't be happy until there's a talent at every tier that increased damage by 20%... Best for them just to ignore these types as they can't be reasoned with. Hate on it all you want but Blizz are right.You know, your guildy has a point. If we can switch them so seamlessly and easily, there's really no point in making us chose. I've looked over a lot of the trees, and so far, it doesn't look like having access to all of them would be game-breaking too much, although I would imagine it would be a nightmare to balance, and we all know how much blizzard LOVES to balance.<br />

What I think we need to see are skill 'books'. Being able to save many tree choices in one spec, and able to switch to it easily without having to wipe the spec and pick all the abilities over again. In other words, we have dual spec where, say, you pick your tank and DPS spec. Then within each spec, you have a 'book' of sorts with, we'll say 5 pre-saved specs, all with different talent tree options selected. So instead of having to re-select each talent we want to change, we can just pick a tree, go through a cast time like dual spec already has, and then boom, new talents in place. Not broken in any way, just saving us some time and effort, really.</div></div><hr />

But alas, twice he (she/it??) dismissive very valid concern with the same pat response &quot;You're wrong. Next!&quot; I mean, come on now!! The game is faltering, losing over 5 million subscribers since just before Thanksgiving last year, and they themselves have had months and months to see the shortcomings of a 5-level expansion, yet, they take absolutely zero of those lessons and aplly them to Pandaland. Wow is dead. Kaput. This next expansion should be 15 levels, make up for the crap-fest that was/is Cata, make leveling a chore, reward the effort put in and have a story with (shock shock horror) &quot;A Big and Omnipresent Badass That You Can't wait to Engage.&quot; But nope, 5 meaningless levels, JC will get the shaft for 6 months while newbs level-up BS and LW, and there is no end-all, be-all Mofo with whom you dream of tallying-ho versus.

I wish fans would stop using the &quot;tired of the game&quot; line. No, people are absolutely NOT leaving just because they're tired of the game. They're leaving because the quality has gone down the toilet. The drop was immediate and dramatic with the release of Cata in the US and Europe, while WotLK kept subs growing in China. Cata was released in China half a year later and met with the exact same dramatic drop in subs. The sub loss is clearly, identifiably, objectively (as in, it's not &quot;opinion&quot;) due to Blizzard's own design choices.<br />
<br />
I participated in the Cata beta. Hundreds of us voiced opinions which were contrary to their design decisions. We said healing wasn't nearly as fun, that Holy Power wasn't well-thought or well-implemented, that leveling was far too quick, that dungeons were far too slow, that Tol Barad was a disaster... basically every complaint that was voiced on live. GC responded that we &quot;weren't being helpful&quot; and STOPPED POSTING on the Beta forums. Now we're seeing the exact same thing with MoP design choices, even before beta. They are coming up with a talent system that a lot of people are unhappy with. Instead of dealing with this vocal not-a-minority, he's doing the same &quot;you're wrong - la la la, I can't hear you&quot; thing he did during the Cata beta. It'll have the same result: another few million subs lost.<br />
<br />
This. You summed it all up perfectly. I didn't quit because I was tired of the game. I quit because CATACLYSM made it unfun for me. For the first time since March of 05, WoW was not fun to me anymore. In spite of offering feedback on the forums, in spite of trying to get something through to them. The changes went through no matter how much the community roared out against them. And the same is going to happen in MoP. They hear the community, they hear the feedback. But they are going to do what they want to do, regardless.<br />
<br />
Also, I used to like Ghostcrawler. Used to respect him. Posts like this? That &quot;We're right, and you're wrong. Here are some flimsy excuses as to why&quot; attitude? Are why I hate him now. His attitude has gone to hell since Wrath.</div></div><hr />

resto shaman, for example, you choose instant ghost wolf or bigger totem range, ele shaman are even worse, more mana or bigger totem range (when the hell do ele shaman run out of mana). <br />
prot pallies: you pretty much choose faster movement or 3 different skills that give you more damage. kind of excited about these new trees and actually being able to choose something that matters for a change</div></div><hr />

<br />
This I do agree with... maybe it's just me having envy directed towards some of the other classes, but the hunter talents they've previewed in MoP, for the most part, just seem... boring. GC used the new car example, well, the hunter talents feel more like putting new rims on the same car. Even the shift to focus hasn't changed hunters all that much, in the end - more like switching the car from automatic to manual.<br />

It seems you're not making the distinction between &quot;an actual answer&quot; and &quot;an answer formulated in support of said 'You're wrong, next!&quot;. But we've seen this stuff since TBC kicked the bucket, nothing new. They always look for &quot;customer feedback&quot;, but never act on it in a manner consistent with the actual concerns of players, and do what they want anyway. With 1 million subs gone and counting, all that needs to be said is &quot;WE'RE right, YOU'RE wrong, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!&quot;. But they won't, and MoP with its pandas is to attract kids, just like we were 6/7 years ago when we joined the game and get them hooked.

<br />
That first and foremost means that he does not see the point of the players that are doing diffrent content in the game. <br />
<br />
The new talent tree is a joke. There are DIFFRENT sort of content in this game and players should be allowed to adjust to it if they want to. IF they want to. <br />
<br />
Blizzard designs the trees for cookie cutters so ofc there are some. They directly PREVENTED ppl to do any thing else by forcing them to go 31 into one tree first. <br />
<br />
GC has gone powermad. He thinks he knows it all but he does not look at it from the perspective of the players - only from the perspective of the dev that want to have 100% control over balance in the game and buff and nerf classes at will. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lolpanda</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in the Cata beta, and the Wrath beta as well. They were night and day compared to one another. It seemed like the Wrath beta was much more slow to invite masses of players, instead sampling from a smaller group who were there to actually play test, and not treat it like a free preview. The blues were helpful and the players constructive, and the DK forums were simply awash with input, most of which was responded to in some way or tested out. (Believe it or not, my husband was one of the Unholy DKs who started suggesting that Unholy, as a master of ghouls, get a permanent ghoul for themselves.) Me, I spent half my time in the DK forums (where I laugh about just how broken beta Blood DKs were - you think their self-healing now was absurd? Unlimited number of bloodworms spawning on AUTO ATTACKS mwahahaha) and staring glumly at the shaman forums, where all the enhancement players were wringing their hair and screaming about how DKs were going to be benching enh shamans everywhere.<br />
<br />
No matter what the goddamn expansion, the sky is always falling for shamans. Christ.<br />
<br />
Anyway. The Wrath beta was fun, and enjoyable, and minus that little Ret with the GOD SWITCH flipped on snafu, an overall success. Then came Cata. Suddenly their subs had ballooned to 12 million, Wrath was a rousing success ... aaaaaaaaand it all went straight to their heads. The Cata beta was shit. Utter shit. They started mass-inviting before things were even ready for a beta release, and most of these people weren't interested in submitting bugs or offering critique. They were there to get a free preview. The blues, especially Ghostcrawler, were very condescending and smug in a very &quot;my shit don't stink a'cause I got 12 million subscribers whaaaaaaaat?&quot; fashion. If suggestions weren't worded with 95% ass-kissing and hand-holding, GC or another blue would flop out the big blue Blizzard e-peen and start threatening to revoke the poster's beta status for &quot;trolling&quot; and &quot;being unhelpful&quot;. What happened when Cata was released? Subs took a nosedive. Not surprising, given that they didn't listen to any of the suggestions - and how could they, when they started inviting hundreds of players hand over fist when the game was a week out of beta from the alpha. Half of the posts on the forums were complaints about bugs - not bug reports, actual complaints, and the other half were WHAT SHOULD THE WORGEN DANCE BE?<br />
<br />
Given that they're handing out MoP keys to everyone with one of those goddamn obnoxious Tyrael's Chargers, I suspect the MoP beta will be no different, unless they sorely learned their lesson about being arrogant pillocks when it comes to the testing phase of their game.<br />

See? I can do that too. The point is I DON'T like the talent changes and DON'T buy into their crappy excuses. I supported and loved WoW from when I started until Catacylsm. I disapprove of the direction they are taking and of the changes they are making. I am not trying to twist anything to fit my <br />
'predetermind notion' of Blizzard, I don't HAVE to. If something doesn't sound like a good idea to me, if it doesn't sound FUN for me, then I am not going to like it. End of story. That doesn't make me wrong, and that SURE doesn't make Blizzard right.</div></div><hr />

Here is one for the masses <br />
&quot;There will still be cookie cutters&quot; <br />
GC &quot;You're Wrong, Next&quot; <br />
Community &quot;Actually your wrong, do your job better or at least honestly research&quot; <br />
<br />
2 points doesn't keep this from being cookie cutter....if you use a cookie cutter in real life you still decide to put frosting eyes and nose on it so 2 points doesn't stop something from being cookie cutter. Also yes, cookie cutter will exist, just in an even more micromanaged format. Just because in MoP there won't be a cookie cutter build overall, there will be a cookie cutter build for EVERY DAMN FIGHT. Priest talent tier 1, there is going to be times where you can't root mobs in a boss fight, but might be able to fear them or the other way around and that is extremely simplified. Meaning each fight will decide what talent you choose for that particular fight and theorycrafters will have no problem looking over boss and the adds mechanics and finding out exactly which talent build is most relevant to each fight. Its almost like blizzard ignores this so that they can get the talent teams mission statement of &quot;no more cookie cutters&quot; to actually be meaningful. I mean you give us the ability to swap talents at will and you don't think there will be a cookie cutter for every fight. I want to believe the lies, but next time GC feels like making a post maybe he should. After defending you at blizzcon so you can write this BS is amazingly disappointing. <br />
<br />
TLDR:Also if games can't be decided by popular vote then stop asking for our input only to tell us it really isn't relevant. That's patronizing and nobody likes that.</div></div><hr />

I don't have much to say. I've played the game for 7 years, I agree with just about everything in the blue post. The new talents are great.<br />
As for people saying you'll have less choices that matter, you're .. well, I can't swear here. That's false. The current trees are the most restricting trees we've ever had. The ones we had before were more free, but a lot more boring.<br />

It does look like, to some classes, that they are being short changed. Then there is Blizzard assuming that most of us will buy the xpac anyway, so the fuss from people who have something like Bladestorm taken off them will be minimal.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing. It's not just shockwave. Please somebody correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, but going through the list of prot powers I'm not seeing Challenging Shout or Demoralizing Shout anywhere. However, two of the three &quot;options&quot; for the new level 87 power War Banner are, you guessed it, Challenging Shout and Demoralizing Shout.<br />
<br />
The fact that these two powers now come with a fancy new banner isn't an ugprade to either of them. The fact that both powers now require level 87 is a downgrade to what we already have. What baffles me here is that if Blizzard had just added the skull banner warriors would have said, &quot;An AoE recklessness? That's amazing, &quot; but removing Demo and Challenging Shout and rolling them into War Banner ... that's indicative of a pretty serious disconnect between the designers and the players. The icons for the first two banners should either be a question mark to indicate Blizzard really doesn't get what's going on or a middle finger to indicate that they just don't care. Maybe that's a tad harsh, but come on.<br />
<br />
I can't be the only warrior who's more than a little peeved by all of this, peeved to the point that it's kind of a dealbreaker on MoP, and that's that many fewer tanks in the LFD/LFR queues.</div></div><hr />

Ok, please tell us how there were not cookie cutter builds in Cata. Please tell us what specs had real forced choices between good talent choices. Please tell us where you actually had a decision in placing your talent points that actually mattered at all. <br />

<br />
The only people being dismissive and rude are the players. Some people didn't even read anything that is posted. They already knew they were just going to complain, no matter how irrelevant or illogical those complaints were. Anyone that takes even half a moment to look at the old talent system and compare it to the new talent system will instantly realize the benefit of the new system. The new system basically takes the old cookie-cutter system, pre-cut, then gives you 6 more, hopefully interesting choices.</div></div><hr />

You're wrong. Next!<br />
<br />
Seriously, after sifting through the standard Blizzard rhetoric, there's very little of substance except for those &quot;We're right and you're wrong&quot; lines.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will have fewer choices. But you will have more choices that *matter*.&quot;<br />
<br />
They said this exact same thing before Cataclysm, and I'll repeat my stance from back then.<br />
<br />
First, the very reason cookiecutter builds exist is because certain talents MATTER. Blizzard just doesnt make other talents matter enough, so there is a disparity and people flock to the current 'best' one. Whether there's 3 choices or 300, the number of options doesn't affect the simple fact that people determine that one choice is 'better' for the situation then another.<br />
<br />
The only realistic way to get rid of 'cookie cutter builds' is to make the choices equal, and if Blizzard doesn't believe balancing is the way to do it, then the only way to make them equal is to make them all worthless. Therefor, You have fewer choices, and NONE of them actually matter.<br />
<br />
Cookie cutter builds arent the problem, the lack of choice is the problem. You can have cookie cutter builds, but still have a dozen different Prot builds to select from that are all viable.</div></div><hr />

When people say &quot;blizzard doesn't listen&quot; they don't mean. They don't hear/read our words. We tell them what we want, and they ignore it. <br />
<br />
Sure, blizzard listens. But they only listen so they can respond appropriately to tell us how wrong we are. As GC says here...<br />
<br />
&quot;We have seen a few consistent responses from players concerned or dismissive about the model, so we thought we’d take the opportunity to explain the philosophy behind some of our decisions, to provide a better framework upon which you can continue giving us feedback.&quot;<br />

In many cases, players will have to choose between what they already have now, and there is no way to not leave a bit of bad taste in players mouth after that. All in all, I like the new system, but it certainly has pitfalls. For my class, the most the tree is pointless outside of PvP, as an example. This changes it from &quot;interesting choice&quot; to &quot;Meaningless choice&quot;, and in a PvE setting, there wouldn't be any performance change if you didn't spend half your talent points. But even then, that's an improvement beyond absolute cookie cutter specs, where good players and &quot;noobs&quot; are separated by google fu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the funny thing about humor (pun intended). Often people say one thing when they mean something else, or exaggerate the truth to the point of ridicule. It's almost as funny when someone takes such humorous statements literally, though it's also a little bit sad. On the other hand, those comments were pretty lame (someone actually claimed the non-existence of cookie cutter builds?) and the most vocal section of the community has a disturbing tendency to tend toward also being the most stubborn, self-absorbed and condescending bunch of jerks you'll ever see. A little, &quot;Shut up and sit down, sir,&quot; is certainly well deserved in some cases. <br />
<br />
I've had my share of disappointments with Cataclysm, but I've also come to realize that some of what I remember as really fun back in the Burning Crusade days was fun for different reasons than what I might have thought. A lot of people think that the best thing to do is to go backward and try to recapture what was lost from that era, but that's where I think Cataclysm went wrong the most. Creating completely new content, trying new mechanics, surprising the hell out of us--that was what was so fun about Burning Crusade, not the fact that our 41 point talent trees were so wonderful. Remember back when Blizzard announced that Defense and a few other stats were going away and the &quot;vocal&quot; part of the community screamed bloody murder? Were they still screaming after the game launched? <br />
<br />
I think that Mists of Pandaria's success will ride largely on Blizzard's willingness to focus on making the content and game design fresh, and less time listening to what people think they want, based on nostalgia.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why I'm bothering to respond, as I'm sure I'm merely a 'blizzard zombie,' but here we go anyways.<br />
<br />
You're wrong. Next!<br />
<br />
To be fair, we did manage to engineer most of the Cataclysm talent trees to include a few legitimate choices. These typically occur when you need to spend enough points to get to the next tier of a tree to get the good stuff. Many specs had 1-4 points to spend wherever they want. That's a huge victory compared to pre-Cataclysm talent trees, but ultimately nothing to really brag about.<br />
<br />
It is possible of course to strike a blow for individuality and use a non-cookie cutter build. Ninety-nine percent of the time, these builds are just going to be less effective. The remaining percent of the time, they will eventually become the new cookie-cutter. When players talk about their love of options, I think what they are really saying is they are in love with the idea of having dozens of interesting talents. We just don't think that will ever happen.<br />
<br />
Look, we tried the talent tree model for seven years. We think it’s fundamentally flawed and unfixable. We know some of you have faith in us that someday we’ll eventually replace all of the boring +5% crit talents with interesting talents and give you 80 talent points that you can spend wherever, and that the game will still remain relatively balanced and fun. We greatly appreciate your faith, but we fear it is misplaced. It’s not a matter of coming up with enough fun mechanics, which is challenging but ultimately doable. The problem is the extreme number of combinations. When you have such a gigantic matrix, the chances of having unbeatable synergies, or combinations of talents that just don’t work together is really high. That’s not lazy design. That is recognizing how math works.<br />
<br />
So given that we don’t think it’s humanly possible to have 40-50 fun, interesting and balanced talents in a tree, the alternative is to continue on with bloated trees that have a ton of inconsequential talents that you have to slog through to get to the fun stuff. A lot of you guys have stuck with us for years, continue to play regularly, and still love World of Warcraft. You are the reason we’re still making this game. We think you deserve better, and we think we can do better.<br />
<br />
What part of that answer isn't done well? It fairly humbly explains that they are admitting - blatently admitting - that the talent tree system, after 7 years of work, just isn't working anymore to them. They said that their own design is fundamentally broken and flawed. Blizzard said something that THEY MADE is fundamentally broken and flawed, and that is why they want to change it.<br />
<br /> 
I can't imagine a more humble answer to anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, please tell us how there were not cookie cutter builds in Cata. Please tell us what specs had real forced choices between good talent choices. Please tell us where you actually had a decision in placing your talent points that actually mattered at all.<br />
<br />
Well, speaking from a PVP perspective, depending on my mood I flip between Drums of War so I can get the free AoE fear, Second Wind because passive automatic healing really adds up once you crack 4k resilience, and Piercing Howl because it really irritates the Alliance when you spam it. In my native tree alone I waffle between Incite for the rare cases where that guaranteed crit is going to take down the last fraction of health on a flag carrier or Blood and Thunder because, resilience or no resilience, spraying rend around is just good stupid fun. And that's just the first level.<br />
<br />
<br />
10. “You’ve got your minds made up and don’t care about what we think.”<br />
<br />
Do you even realize that you are bitching about the fact that Blizzard and GC are saying they DO want to listen to the player base?<br />
<br />
This hearkens all the way back to the advent of Burning Crusade when they decided to finally make shamans and paladins available to both factions. Did that prove that Blizzard ultimately listens to the players on the forums who were saying, FOR FREAKING EVER, that the existing system was broken? Sure. Does it still indicate a pretty big disconnect exists between Blizzard's theory and practice? Equally sure. Yes, the change happened, but frankly it should have happened a lot sooner, and there's very, very little doubt in my mind that the change wasn't ultimately driven by the players who kept screaming.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, generally dismissive blue posts serve a purpose. They stir up the rabble and increase the volume. And speaking as somebody who's been here since the first day, volume is all Blizzard ever seems to actively pay attention to.</div></div><hr />

I don't give a fuck about the rest of the Q and A, I just want to know why on earth they even think that stripping away utility from each Priest spec (for example, leaving Spriests with Flash Heal only) is a remotely good idea considering that they're the only cloth healer class and there'll be more competition from Monks?</div></div><hr />

I don't want to play the same prot paladin as all the other prot paladins. With the new talents, any other prot paladin in the world is just 15 seconds away from being exactly like you. At least in WotLK if someone wanted to copy your spec they would have to look you up on armory. This is homogenization and cookie cutting, plain and simple.

Take for instance the 4th tier.<br />
You can choose between a totem that heals the most wounded for 10 seconds. (3 min CD)<br />
40% of healing/damage is duplicated to a nearby ally as healing for 10 seconds. (3 min CD)<br />
10% magic damage reduction for players standing in your healing rain (passive)<br />
<br />
How is this NOT interesting? Personally, I'm not playing a shaman, but this is freakin' interesting. The 40% are a lot more single-target minded than the healing totem, so on a fight Yor'sahj with a green glob up, it'd be really damn useful. Also, if you're a elemental shaman, you can even use this to help out your healers if they're in trouble. How is that not intersting?<br />
10% magic damage reduction in healing raid. Say, the DW fight, and you took down Nozdormu, so Elementium Bolts are blasting through, and you want to minimize raid damage by using barrier - oh, you got healing rain to mitigate dmg aswell! How is that not interesting? Need I mention, you can pick this in enchancement and elemental too to help out your healers? How is that not interesting?<br />
<br />
&quot;We get less choices!&quot;<br />
Yeah, but as Blizzard said - they matter more. Look above if you disagree. Are you gonna tell me you're gonna pick the healing totem to mitigate singe target damage on your tank? I'd go for the 40% healing/damage duplication to nearby ally as, say elemental and be able to help out my healers. I think that's very interesting. In short: Choices matter!<br />
You want +30% critical damage? Well, what does it matter if it's a no-brainer and people pick it anyway. You're even. You have the same potential as everyone else. How is that interesting?

You do know that there are ppl that dont even bother to gem and enchant. THose are the ppl that are destroying the game cause when they come into groups with other players - they direclty effect other players activity. <br />
<br />
The talent tree is NOT about making bad players better. It is only about keepin 100% balance for the TOP players. THose that actually gem up and use enchants. THe thing is... those ppl know what they are doing and CAN handle more variety in choises in their talent trees. They know good talents from bad ones. SO give them real choises - not some Nab choises where balance ends up beeing only about how much Blizzard cares for this or that class or this or that role in every given time.<br />

You just talked about 1 tier out of 6 there. So 1 in 6 is not bad ? 1 meainingful choise... 5 pointless ones. Thats not great. Thats crap design.<br />
<br />
Lets look at Paladins shall we<br />
<br />
1 tier is about speeding up. 3 diffrent ways of speeding up. Matter much ? not really since its all just about speeding so why not give the class 1 speeding up ability.<br />
<br />
2. 1 CC ablity. Paladins loose CC abilitie they have had from Vanilla. They get a chooise to pick it. Thats called nerf <br />
<br />
3. Defenive ability. Tanking abilites have been thown across the tree and you pick 1 of 3. Yes - Thats how childish that tier is. Tanking abilites that all roles are forced to make a &quot;meaningfull&quot; choise.<br />

<br />
Lets look at Paladins shall we<br />
<br />
1 tier is about speeding up. 3 diffrent ways of speeding up. Matter much ? not really since its all just about speeding so why not give the class 1 speeding up ability.<br />
<br />
2. 1 CC ablity. Paladins loose CC abilitie they have had from Vanilla. They get a chooise to pick it. Thats called nerf <br />
<br />
3. Defenive ability. Tanking abilites have been thown across the tree and you pick 1 of 3. Yes - Thats how childish that tier is. Tanking abilites that all roles are forced to make a &quot;meaningfull&quot; choise.<br />
<br />
This is bad. There is no way around it.<br />
<br />
3 different ways of speeding up. Matter much? Yes! Yes, it matters much. Hagara HC. Ice-phase. You can't judge her, and you gotta run. The faster, the better. So the long arm is pretty much a no-go. Speed of Light: 1 min CD, probably not the best. Pursuit of Justice: Seems like a good solution. Just make sure you have holy power at the time, you really have to run, or atleast generate it.<br />
Matters? Yes, because if you don't give a shit, the risk that the ice-wall behind you is gonna crush you is bigger. So I say, yes this matters.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but I played Holy Paladin and I wouldn't mind having the ability to CC an add once in a while. Are the targets you're dealing with stunable? Well, what about Alysrazor. You can stun the adds. the longer they're stunned, the fewer casts. So you can choose between CCing shit (Keep in mind, a lot of mobs aren't CCable) or a 6 second stun. Sure, they're both really situational, but they're nice to have, and they give you some extra utility. How's that not interesting? It may not have a serious effect on every encounter, but it would have on some. Matters, yes! Of course it does.<br />
<br />
You think the 3rd tier is childish? I really have to get this out of my head now: what the fuck? I can see this being VERY useful on progress nights. Are we going to die? Hell yes! Do I want more survivability? Hell yes! Matters? Go figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is bad. There is no way around it.&quot;<br />
I'm always open to solid arguments, but this just isn't a good argument. Frankly, ANY choice that has an effekt on your style of play is more useful that a cookie-cutter build. Right? Or is that where we go apart?<br />
<br />
Side note: I've seen all the talent trees through time, and I must say, I've never been this intrigued by a talent tree. This concept actually involves thinking of ways to use your talents, not just go &quot;OH! 30% more healing with Divine Light! MUST HAVE!&quot;. What does that matter anyway? These talents involves a lot of utility and movement perfection, which also is vital to some roles like for instance stationary healers or melee DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
&quot;You just talked about 1 tier out of 6 there. So 1 in 6 is not bad ? 1 meainingful choise... 5 pointless ones. Thats not great. Thats crap design.&quot;<br />
<br />
Excuse me, where did you reach the conclusion that I think the other 5 where crap? Leaving it out doesn't mean, they're crap. it COULD suggest it, sure, but unless you're a mind-reader, I would like to see a quote from me on that.<br />
Point is, I don't think they're crap, so don't put words in my mouth. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

We have heard similar in the past but we have been let down on occasions with reality falling well short of the rhetoric. <br />
<br />
I am still at a loss as to why there are no new talents for any class between 85 and 90. Even a modest reshuffling of those already published to give some &quot;joy&quot; in the intermediate levels and would at least give the impression of developing the character which is what it should be about (my opinion). <br />
<br />
Provided Blizz devs can match the rhetoric then we will see how much better it can be...otherwise it will end up in another disappointment.....and I am not hammering past performance...just the implementation needs to match the promises.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarien</div><div class="date">2011-12-09, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this new system sucks. While the choices are more interesting than simply selecting an extra 10% damage or 5% crit you are only making six choices. Even if the choices you make are obvious ones I think that the illusion of choice gives a great deal of satisfaction to gamers. <br />
<br />
And who cares if we google our specs? Do they think that people won't still google which six choices are the best for raids, battlegrounds, arena? Sometimes when you haven't played in a while or you are new to end game it's nice to know that at least you are on the right path while you learn about your class and it's abilities. No one really gets to max level and instantly knows how to play or what the best choices are. There is no fun for many people in trialling one spec after another against a dummy with a meter finding the highest output spec. Decisions like this that dumb the game down and take things away from players make me glad I unsubbed earlier this year. I want more choices, more depth, not less. I don't want to be treated like a five year old with a mental deficiency. <br />

I wish fans would stop using the &quot;tired of the game&quot; line. No, people are absolutely NOT leaving just because they're tired of the game. They're leaving because the quality has gone down the toilet. The drop was immediate and dramatic with the release of Cata in the US and Europe, while WotLK kept subs growing in China. Cata was released in China half a year later and met with the exact same dramatic drop in subs. The sub loss is clearly, identifiably, objectively (as in, it's not &quot;opinion&quot;) due to Blizzard's own design choices.<br />
<br />
I participated in the Cata beta. Hundreds of us voiced opinions which were contrary to their design decisions. We said healing wasn't nearly as fun, that Holy Power wasn't well-thought or well-implemented, that leveling was far too quick, that dungeons were far too slow, that Tol Barad was a disaster... basically every complaint that was voiced on live. GC responded that we &quot;weren't being helpful&quot; and STOPPED POSTING on the Beta forums. Now we're seeing the exact same thing with MoP design choices, even before beta. They are coming up with a talent system that a lot of people are unhappy with. Instead of dealing with this vocal not-a-minority, he's doing the same &quot;you're wrong - la la la, I can't hear you&quot; thing he did during the Cata beta. It'll have the same result: another few million subs lost.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure enough people that were in the Beta are on these forums anymore for your post to come across like it should.<br />
<br />
You're so dead on it's scary. <br />
<br />
So much was brought up on the beta forums and for a while there was discussion. Then GC did exactly what you said. He spouted off about how everyone not helping to which most assumed cause we we're actually beta testing and giving feedback which GC and blizzard didn't seem to like. Then all talk discussion ended from the beta testers point of view cause we got little to no more blue post responses.<br />

so even if you don’t care for PvP now, maybe we can get you interested in the future. This is the worst comment I have ever read. Are they dumb enough to assume that people who have been playing for over 5 years will just have a sudden change of faith and want to pick up PvP because it's forced upon us, no.

That's a huge victory compared to pre-Cataclysm talent trees, but ultimately nothing to really brag about.&quot; <br />
<br />
Too bad you had the same choice before cataclysm too, can't see that being a victory, as it was a throwback actually. I remeber I had slightly different spec for my fury warrior instead of the &quot;default cookie cutter build&quot; some players blindly used, since I understood those talents and what worked for me most for raiding. I actually had a choice there what didn't really affect dps. Most players actually started using that build on ICC later... <br />
<br />
Also I can't see any difference from cata one instead of having less to spend on leveling and making the leveling progress more boring. I really can't see how the fewer choices of the MoP will fix low level gameplay at all on RPG standpoint. I've already seen many players on LFD to ask why blizzard doesn't just hand us out with 80 lvl characters, since the leveling progress doesn't feel like leveling one, just annoying dungeon/guest grind what is not a challenge either... it's just boring, you can't even learn to use your weapons (yes it was annoying, but so is grinding). <br />
<br />
Even the glyphs just start out rolling on later levels and you only have few choices, so the first 50 lvl's should be just skipped on how the blizzard has turned it to be. Oh well, at least you still get abilities from the trainer when you level up, sometimes. But shame some of those are more fitting spending as a talent point imho! :p</div></div><hr />

Right, outside of guildies I doubt I would have gotten a lot of dungeoning with that one standing).Especially the teleport part. I liked to travel to the dungeon. In cata, I didn't know where the hell the entrance was, cause I always got ported there.I don't like that they increased SR cd to 25 sec from 10.I don't like that they made bladestorm disarmable. I agree with Valinara, bladestorm and shockwave at level 90 wtf?I don't like that they looked at arms threat and removed the extra threat on some abilities waaaaaay later than they were supposed to. I don't know if it's still an issue or not, I'm guessing with 500% increased threat on all tanks, it's not. I remember in BOT/ICC I constantly had to ask for salvation, thanks paladins :).I don't like how they normalized rage and then still conjure up the nerf bat, which they said that rage normalization would take care of. I liked the old rage system. Additionally, less rage when taking damage. I'm a warrior, I get angry when you hit me. Now, not anymore. now it's pretty much runic power, more or less.I don't like that they removed the possibility to tank with a dk as frost. I loved tanking with a frost DK, was fun for me. Add to that the most stupid glyph I have ever seen, the one where you had aoe horror/fear on death and decay. I still cannot understand how that glyph made it live.I don't like that I killed Onyxia 2 times already (would have been 3 times if I were max level in Vanilla).I don't like the fact that there's no world pvp (I blame flying mounts for that), everyone stands in the cities waiting for lfg queue/bg queue/arena queue.I don't like the constant reskinning on weapons/armor/mobs. Also the design for some weapons, armor and shields was awful, in my opinion. Best shield, Bullwark of azzinnoth, can we have more of those? oh ye, easier with transmogrification.Right.I did not like gearscore addon (or epeen-score), now it's practically in the game.I don't like the LFR, I think it will slowly destroy guilds. Remains to be seen :).I did not like vehicle combat whatsoever.I don't like that there's no war in world of WARcraft.I don't that MoP is based around pandaren (note, I don't care if they add the pandaren, basing a whole expansion around them, that's not cool).I don't like the new talent tree system.I don't like charge and intercept sharing a cd.I don't like MS beeing spread around to each and everyone.Last but not least, making things easier does not educate people, in any role whatsoever.List of things that I liked while playing wow:I liked to kill dragons (just not the same one, mind you).I liked that they made taunt ranged. I liked the blood and thunder talent. I liked Bladestorm. I liked spell reflect.I liked some of the dungeon/raid encounter designs, they were very nice. For example, Kharazhan/Zul'Aman. Perhaps the other TBC raids were cool too, I did not get to see BT at the right time, or Kael'thas.Heard Kael'thas was a fun fight, unfortunately did not get to see it in TBC. I liked ICC, was fun. TOC, not so much.I loved the wrathgate trailer, that was epic. When young Saurfang yelled &quot;For the Horde&quot; and the Kor'kron also yelled that, gave me goosebumps. I liked the battle for Undercity quest, that was very nice.I liked windfury totem (tbc version). I also liked sword spec (arms mastery now, only nerfed).I think I forgot some things on each side (likes/dislikes). Still, dislike list longer. Have fun people, that's the most important thing :).prolly OT... bored</div></div><hr />

<br />
He basically took his ball and went home. I understand why; he works hard on designing the game and people told them about many problems with his design. It's part hubris and part frustration. With that said, it was far more frustrating for those of us in the beta. Differences of opinion on design are one thing; &quot;this is broken, actually broken and not working as you even intend&quot; is something different.<br />
<br />
As to the talent trees (ignoring the semantic arguments), if you can truly respec at will between boss fights with a few clicks of a button then they are pointless. It's another of those quirks in design logic that leave people baffled. You either have to balance around people having the talents/abilities, in which case they are mandatory, or you balance around people NOT having them in which case they are overpowered for the boss fight/content. Alternatively, you make them so godawful terrible that the whole question is moot and you piss people off even more. A few easy examples below (25man to make the thought process easier) but I can go through the entire talent system making the same arguments: <br />
<br />
1) (non-talent argument) feral druids and shred/mangle. If they can't shred, they have to mangle. If you balance them around using mangle, their dps will be fine when they can and too high when they shred. Conversely, if you balance around being able to shred then when they cannot the dps is too low. If you make the damage the same, nobody would ever use shred. <br />
2) Shaman T4 talents: Damage reduction cooldowns are better than healing abilities the vast majority of the time. Either you assume a shaman brings this talent to the raid for fights with heavy, raid-wide magic damage and balance accordingly or it can be overpowered.<br />
3) Druid T2 talents: Either you balance the raid around DPS/tank druids maintaining Cenarion Ward on the Tank on cooldown (which would be macroed, obviously) or the ability is overpowered. <br />
4) Warrior T6 talents: Every boss fight without adds makes Avatar mandatory for Warriors unless they buff Bladestorm to the point of being ridiculous.<br />
5) Mage T5 talents: Can anyone name a boss fight where you polymorph anymore? It is now a 5-man and pvp ability by and large. Moot talent choice.<br />
Either talents will become cookie-cutter, again, or the choices will be insignificant. In the former case, we are no better off than we were. In the latter, everyone is frustrated and more people quit.</div></div><hr />

When the developer feels like they have to defend their design choices against a community that is holding a mutiny against them, there's certainly an issue. I believe this whole battle the naysayers started with GC's little table flip comment and has gone into a full bore gloves off slugfest. They come up with a design, the community tells them to leave things alone or negatively responds, and then Blizzard fires back with a jab at the community while attempting to justify the design decision. To me it just seems unnecessary.<br />

They scramble (and cripple imo) the talent system to make it seem new and exciting. The only problem is, they are simplifying the game into utter boredom, thinking the whole time that if they make it dumb enough way more people will want to play. My money is on the opposite happening. Maybe - just ever so slightly maybe - new casual players will be attracted, but only for awhile. What was compelling about the game is being diluted to a bland pap. There is a very basic aspect of game design that is being totally missed, or perhaps abandoned, by Blizz. At least it took them a couple decades to stumble upon, giving us much rich entertainment in the meantime.</div></div><hr />

You will have fewer choices. But you will have more choices that *matter*&quot; <br />
<br />
This simply isn't true. My shaman for example has a bunch of totems I will never use, and a cooldown I've had for years. It's the same for almost all other classes too. None of the choices (with the exception of a few) &quot;matter&quot;. TOTALLY dreadful idea. We went from like 60 talent points, to 40 and now 6 ... How is this more choice? Dreadful!<br />
<br />
The thing is you didn't have any choices at all if you wanted t be good. There was a cookie cutter spec and if you weren't that spec you weren't performing at your peak. +5% crit is not interesting. There will certainly be cookie cutter specs with his system too, but you will have different talents for every fight. Picking between cool abilitys is better then picking 5% crit or having 5% haste.</div></div><hr />

IMHO, pre-cata talent trees were best. you had many options.<br />

Fact or not, you take away some of our enhancement talents and give them back as choices that matter ... yeah great job, pat yourself on your shoulder for doing a good job ... None of the crap are really choices that matter ... now I can chose if I want to be enh/elemental or enh/resto ... this alone give more choices than all you have planned for mop, because this is stuff that really matters. Alone the Wind Shear nerf, how it hit us enh shamans just shows how out of touch you are with our class. 0 raiding enh shamans had this talent, yep 0 ... now you take away our healing for mop. A whole mana bar used on healing surges gives us only 40% of our hp back ... great ... I am kind of sad that you announced the annual pass before these details, because the talent system as it is now will not keep me tied to this game. You have been dumbing down stuff for 2 expansions now and at some time you reach a point where it is a bit too much for people to bear. You have been losing subs en masse and go on making this game pointless, kind of sad ... Vanilla may have had its flaws ... basically everything required some effort and if you saw a human on a tiger then you knew he put a hell lot of effort into it ... like 10000000 morrowgrain ... nowadays its just so pointless ... everything ... I can hardly find the motivation to log on anymore. You even punish people who want to put effort into farming (daily satchels for seasonal bosses). I have been running horseman each day on like 5 chars the past years and saw the mount only twice and that on the same char, cool system ... the more I think about it the more I want to cancel the sub right now.</div></div><hr />

For instance, I loved it in Wrath when DK dual wield tanking was feasible. In an MMO, choice and customization is everything. I don't want to play the same prot paladin as all the other prot paladins. With the new talents, any other prot paladin in the world is just 15 seconds away from being exactly like you. At least in WotLK if someone wanted to copy your spec they would have to look you up on armory. This is homogenization and cookie cutting, plain and simple. And I hate where this game is going.<br />

<br />
They could have done something interesting with that concept, like say...<br />
- 5 tiers of utility talents useful to all specs of that class.<br />
- 5 tiers of spec-specific talents which require actual sacrifice and dramatically change play style.<br />
- 5 tiers of role-specific talents which are available to every class with a spec which fits the role (things like Last Stand for all tanks).<br />
<br />
Instead, they went with utterly meaningless choices. The talents are either no-brainers for your spec/role or are just pointless passives which have little to do with your spec.<br />

GC is setting up a ridiculous false dichotomy by pretending the only two options are the Cata cookie cutter system or the MoP REMOVAL of meaningful talents altogether. No, the other option is creating a complex talent system which allows for drastically different specs/playstyles/abilities. Balance would be nearly impossible with that sort of system, and homogenization would be impossible, but that's sort of the whole point. If you create content quickly enough, that sort of system would just have so many choices which would perform so differently on each new encounter that &quot;cookie cutter&quot; would lose all meaning.<br />
<br />
But that's hard and complicated, and the new WoW is all about homogenization, over-simplification, and the removal of mechanics. Most of those here who are defending it are doing so based entirely on Blizzard's PR. Do none of you remember what they said about the Cata talent revamp? Right, don't listen to the PR here, either.</div></div><hr />

You're just gonna go to EJ and copypasta the optimal build anyways.<br />
<br />
The amount of anger in response to the talent changes is upsetting :(<br />
<br />
Whose this 'you' you're talking about? Definitely not I, since I never once went to EJ for a build. I built my characters talents from the ground up, determining what was best for me and my playstyle. Often that was close to the 'cookie cutter' that people would post here and on the forums, but it was always mine. Picked by me, and tested by me. So yes. I can say I had 'customization'.<br />
<br />
People are angry because they DON'T LIKE IT. I don't see how that's hard to understand. Just because you don't get it, doesn't mean people don't have a reason to be mad about it. And Blizzard taking this high and mighty &quot;We are right, you are WRONG&quot; attitude make's it even worse. Sorry, but the only people who are wrong here are Blizzard. For me, this new talent system is what's wrong. That's my opinion, and them trying to tell me it's incorect is not only annoying, but frankly stupid.</div></div><hr />

The guy can sure talk the talk but cannot walk the walk.<br />

i truly am honestly shocked that he still has a job. i dont get that. if i had lost the % of costumers at my job that he has since he took over i would be unemployed. my boss wouldn't stand for that. amazing that the people above GC do.</div></div><hr />

They need to go away from that combat model and introduce some mechanics that are not based only on Damage Given/Damage Taken and maybe some talents which nobody uses might come handy. I don't know, design some experimental encounters in the likes of chess event and similar, but this time include active player participation, I don't know races, who gets faster from A to B, and then some speed talents like Body and Soul might come handy.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying go away from the current model, but if you sometimes change the fights around a bit, maybe I wouldn't have to go for that extra 15% more healing talent, but pick something else instead. But you messed that up anyway with Cataclysm with your Mastery. At least before I could make a complete crap build, by spending equal amount of points in all 3 trees, as opposed right now most points are spent in a single tree anyway, just to unlock the other two.<br />
As a Holy priest right now, you have exactly 3 choices: Go with 2/2 Inspiration or 2/2 body and soul or 2/2 Blessed Resilience, you have to pick one, everything else in that Holy tree is pretty much needed anyway. And when you're done with the Holy tree, you are left with 9 talents with which you can do crap anyway, but pick the obviously best choices - and that is not cookie cutters but bad talent design.<br />
<br />
If they can offer some choices with this new MoP talent system, they could have offered similar choices in the past with each talent tear. Or you know, have spells/abilities that are not affected by talents, but rather offer just new abilities through talents, just the change from that would offer various talent specs, instead of boosting Greater Heal by 15% offer a new kind of Heal, or maybe a new Shield on the same tier level and so on and so forth - well they're doing that right now effectively, but still I would like to see more choices in the end and maybe keep the trees alive for each spec. <br />
<br />
It all vent downhill with the talents when you removed downranking spells.</div></div><hr />

I'm amazed, just as you, that he's still in charge of WoW. He is just driving it into the ground.<br />
<br />
The saddest part about him is, he doesn't listen to the community at all, unless it really starts boiling and usually downplays any major concerns with his broken logic which apparently isn't working quite well, looking and how WoW is in decline ever since he took over the reins. Worse even, he sometimes actively insults customers of his, with his witty remarks. It's just pretty sad what this game has turned into after his appearance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ret pallys cry all the time because in WOTLK start they got nerfed. holy shit an anti undead class was OP in an undead instance! By the end of Wrath you were still pulling sick numbers unless you were an idiot. <br />
Now in Cata you expect the same numbers when not fighting undead. Suck it up. You're still a powerful class with a shit ton of players. (if not the majority)<br />

As Ghostcrawler said &quot;don’t assume you speak for everyone&quot; The wow forums are a tiny percent of the player base and the more vocal players are the unhappy players.

I really think that it's not giving us more choice honestly, I think it's give us less choice. chosing between 6pts dont give me more choice I will just still pick the one that do damage if I want to DPS. honestly what would have been nice is give us the choice to chose between the 3 talent tree by just making more pts, 80pts woot now I can be a real ret with healing, now cool I can be a fire arcane mage cause I can slow peeps and then fireball them.<br />
<br />
Incase you guys didnt try Rift go look at the spec. it's awesome! that was nice to have to chose who you wanted to be. a mage/rogue could have been fun. I played till lvl35 just to try it. <br />
<br />
I'm a wow fan since 2004 and I will always be. I'm not raiding anymore cause I dont have the time for it but I'm lvling a warlock for fun and honestly I hate when I pop my lvl and have no point to put on. can you imagined what it will be now with only 6 pts :confused: yaye finally lvl 20 to get a pts !!! damn it now I have to lvl 40 to have this :mad:sorry blizzard I always have been a greet fan of you and your game are the more polish one but this 6 pts thingy suck hard.

I'm just going to say right now that Blizzard will be in for a surprise. With talents like these, dungeons and raids are going to have to be easy as shit if we even want to stand a chance at survival. And I guarantee that not just the &quot;vocal minority&quot; will dislike that enough to just leave after a while.<br />

They may put up with a lot. But will their friends do so as well? That's a risk Blizzard has not given even a single thought, and it makes for a very unstable platform that they're building MoP on.</div></div><hr />

I've been saying the same thing for months. Bookmarked this and added it to my list so maybe people will listen now that it has blue text. Well and the dev team presents their arguments in a more coherent and easier to follow fashion.<br />
<br />
(If by coherent you mean a smarmy, holier than thou way, sure, I'll give you that one. <br />
<br />
And even though house is more than popular, being a complete douchebag to your customers is so juvenile that it's almost not worth talking about to someone who believes otherwise, but I'll humor your ignorance just this once.)<br />
<br />
&quot;anymore&quot; indicates that there was a time WoW PvP was ever remotely close to balanced. Vanilla and TBC PvP balance was beyond awful. Wrath was alright in certain seasons (not the first few).<br />
<br />
(If you really think it was unbalanced, than you obviously played a ret paladin in BC. To say it was more awful than Cata, is a little further than ridiculous. I wonder why MLG dropped WoW since it was so awesome in your view... Even at the end of Wrath it wasn't balanced, Shadowmourne, ICC trinkets &gt; PvP equivalents, are you trolling bro? If not, you obviously had never played past 1800. )<br />
<br />
You must not read the forums often. Go look on the Bluetracker, there are like 3 threads in the last month about it alone. There are threads all the time on the official forums from the casual playerbase who like seeing all the content and leveling faster<br />
.<br />
Wow, 3 threads is srs bsns man. Out of 10 million people. 3 is literally so many. Really.</div></div><hr />

He didn't use statistics.<br />
<br />
I quit because my guild quit and all my friends were already gone. I had no desire to find a new guild or to try to build up something new. If content was really good I would have stayed for the content but it wasn't. The only thing that I liked doing was progress with a guild through hardmodes and get realm firsts or maybe even better. The raids aren't that much fun to do in easy mode, it's boring. Gear also means nothing anymore so going for that special piece of gear to show off... no more.<br />
<br />
The only reason they make these talent trees is because they want accessibility because they think that's what keeps people playing. That is true for short term bad/new players. But I like to figure out things. Who cares if I don't have the perfect build right from the start. The only time this became a problem was in WotLK when there was no progression anymore except for the last raid. Everyone skipped everything and never actually learned and experienced people had to suffer from new players mistakes.<br />
The rest of the talent trees was just fine, no one complained about 'cookie cutter builds'. It was fun to play with builds. Choosing between survival or extra healing/dps or changing things up for PvP.<br />
<br />
Accessibility and easy is the way they are going. So if you don't like it quit, they are not going to change. It will destroy what the game used to be, it already did. And people who liked this type of game will only stay because of guilds or friends.<br />
This game is now awesome for casual players. But from my experience casual gamers don't play games for a long time. They will also do LFR and finish the new content within a week then wait for the next patch and cancel their subscription.<br />
<br />
No offense to anyone. The game just changed so much. It's not for long term players anymore (the game itself not the social aspects).<br />

<br />
After all, I myself am still playing just because of my friends. I mean, I don't have time to raid through other means then LFR, nor do I have any interest whatsoever in PvP. I only come online to have fun with my friends.<br />
I'm not saying everybody is just like me in that regard, but I would not be surprised if the majority is this way, if not at least half of the current playerbase.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be either. When everything is handed to you and you don't have to figure out things yourself a game becomes boring really fast. And now with LFR it's becoming even easier to see content. When a game becomes boring to you you either quit or you have fun with friends. <br />
Dumbing down the game will make it more boring and people will eventually quit. But yes they do attract new players this way and some will stay longer because it is less frustrating but they will also quit faster because there is less to look forward to. As soon as they become experienced it gets boring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2011-12-09, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that talent trees do not work in World of Warcraft as the level cap expands. They cannot continue to give players more and more and more abilities or everyone will have 120 buttons and it will just be wonky as hell. Same with talents.<br />
<br />
See this:<br />
Once upon a time, you got a new talent point every level. That worked okay for a game with 60 levels. It works less well for a game with 90 levels. It probably is totally incomprehensible for a game with 150 levels, should we ever get there.<br />
<br />
So what? I still want to have fun and figure things out myself and play with my talent tree. I don't want them to give out a cookie cutter build, I want to figure it out by myself.<br />
<br />
You know why Skyrim is so awesome (obviously totally different game but with a few mechanics that work the same)? Because you have the freedom to experience with things, you have to figure out things yourself. They don't have 10,000 tooltips that explain everything you have to do, they don't have cookie cutter builds.<br />
Skyrim talents are awesome, but yes they won't work in a PvP environment. But still, a game is about fun and not about having everything handed to you so you don't have to think.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zn</div><div class="date">2011-12-09, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please show me in the Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, or even Cataclysm talent trees where you have a level of meaningful choice that is even remotely close to the ones shown in the more complete talent trees (not Shaman) like Warlocks, Druids, Priests, etc.<br />
<br />
I can think of quite a few examples. Warlocks in vanilla and TBC had several meaningful choices, they could choose to go full affliction, full demo, full destro or a mixture of affliction/demo or affliction/destro (not sure if there was a demo/destro combination, but I think there was at one time or another, never tried). <br />
<br />
Druid healers in TBC could go tree or dreamstate. <br />
<br />
Ferals could go full bear, full cat or a decent compromise for an off-tank role. Fury warriors could throw on a shield and off-tank. Healing Priests could also choose a mix of disc and holy talents that suited their playstyle and the current content they're playing. And don't forget PvP/PvE hybrid specs. <br />
<br />
Yes there have always been &quot;ej-recommended&quot; specs for each role. But so what? You didn't HAVE to follow those suggestions. Want to play a big-dotting afflock with extra health pool for drain tanking? No problem, put a few points into demo to get the extra health. You have to sacrifice some damage but it could come in handy... (&quot;Hello Curator&quot;). <br />
<br />
With Wrath, they dissolved those choices and each spec was made cookie-cutter. With MoP, they're going even farther. My main gripe is that sure, while these optional non-cookie-cutter builds may have been suboptimal in the very top tier of raiding, at least at that time there WERE tiers of raiding (during which some of them were competitive with the cookie-cutter specs). You had to get a certain level of gear before you could progress to the next tier, and it took a lot of time to get to that final tier. Now, they just hand you a tier and that's the tier you play. Not enough gear for the current tier? No problem, 2 weeks of farming badges/justice/valor points/pvp points/etc. and it's yours. <br />
<br />
So the issue is really a combination of less choice in customization and less tiers of raiding. If we have only 1 tier of raiding, then true, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have custom builds. But if there are multiple tiers, then more options during the progression towards that final min-max tier make the game more dynamic. And more fun. <br />
<br />
Please don't cop out and say &quot;we have 3 tiers of raiding now, LFR, normal and heroic.&quot; That's just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who said that in my guild wouldn't be raiding, if you don't know why defensive cooldowns are so important in raids then you should just walk away from your computer now.<br />
<br />
Personally from looking at the intention of the talent trees we will have more choice than ever before. I am a resto shaman and there are currently about 6 specs that you can use in a raid centering around if you want more movement, telluric currents or how you want to dispell. <br />
<br />
Not all of the shaman tiers are currently that exciting, however tier 4 does look good and that tier alone gives me half of the meaningful choices the current system gives. Tier 5 nature's swiftness vs echo is going to be an interesting choice so I'm now up to 6 choices so drawing level with the current system. Tier 2 while less exciting than tier 4 also provides a decent choice in defensive cooldowns so with just 3 tiers I have more real options than I have currently.<br />
<br />
If I look at it from an elemental point of view, Tier 5 now has 3 viable options while tier 4 looses fortifying waters as a reasonable choice, tier 2 is still interesting and tier 1 is going to be interesting when handling trash/adds.<br />
<br />
Enhancement all 3 choices in tier 4 are useful, by using maelstrom procs for healing rain (a common practice by decent enhancement shaman) fortifying waters becomes a valid choice again. <br />
<br />
So all three specs have more viable choices than they currently do. Tier 6 in my opinion sucks and I hope it changes and tiers 1 and 3 are going to be decided by the boss fight more than any choice in playstyle.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I am looking at the wrong talent calculator http://www.wowhead.com/mists-of-pandaria-talent-calculator#s .<br />
<br />
You get a choice out of 3 talents every 15 levels right? And none of them has a real impact on your performance. You can't really make mistakes.<br />
Maybe one talent is better for a certain boss than the other but there isn't much to figure out other than that. And if you choose the 'wrong' one for one boss then it still doesn't matter. Only when you min/max it could maybe matter on a few bosses or when you PvP and you use some sort of tactic.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse all the talents are usefull but it's still boring. And there is far less to choose from. Blue poster can say the choices now matter but they really don't because they have no real impact on your performance.<br />
<br />
You can spin it every way you want but these talent trees are more boring than the ones in TBC and WotLK. As I said figuring out stuff in a new game is more fun and having more choices even if they 'don't matter' is more fun. Having cookie cutter builds handed out to you is boring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">good diu bro</div><div class="date">2011-12-09, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">7. &quot;Spec doesn’t matter.&quot;This is a concern especially for warriors, priests, DKs and the pure classes (those characters who have multiple specs of the same role). What we have concluded is that many players want to choose their spec based on flavor (“I want to be the mage who uses Frost magic”) or rotation (“I like the fast gameplay of the Frost DK”). While the raid buff / debuff matrix and spec utility helps to encourage diversity among groups and discourage raid stacking, it’s also a little lame when the Affliction lock is asked to spec Demonology (against the player’s desire) in order to bring a specific buff. In Mists, we want players to have even more flexibility about which character they want to play. Asking a player to swap from damage to tanking for a couple of fights is acceptable to us. Asking someone to respec from Unholy to Frost just for the debuff is not.There will still be some utility in the various specs, but less than we have today. You should pick a spec because you like the rotation or the kit. Fire is about crit, Hot Streak, and Ignite. Frost is about Shatter combos and the Water Elemental. Arcane is about mana management and clearing Arcane Blast stacks.<br />
<br />
Priest have to play DISC now is because of damage reduction from Power Word: Barrier (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/62618/power-word-barrier/) can prevent 1-shots, which divine hymn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64843/divine-hymn/)(will become holy exclusive in mist) cannot.<br />
<br />
With the radical change in disc and PW:B still exclusive to disc, this &quot;problem&quot; will worsen. <br />

If you really think choosing between a roots and a snare *MATTERS* to me then you are very much mistaken.I would like to choose options that buff abilities that I use, not just choose flavours of PvP abilities that they will make us use in fights to justify their inclusion.I do read up on my spec, I do try out different builds, I do test things out. I reforge for crit, add a dps metagem, and see if I can abuse the 4 set ICC bonus. I do try out Inner Will and a renew spec (as disc) for HC Atrimedes.I use an Attonement spec, a ToT spec, a Haste spec, a Shadowfiend spec. I like to choose my talents carefully and change them for different bosses when we are stuck on X for Y reason.The new talent trees give me as many new healing options and choices as Transmogrification and PokemonPets combined.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can spin it every way you want but these talent trees are more boring than the ones in TBC and WotLK. As I said figuring out stuff in a new game is more fun and having more choices even if they 'don't matter' is more fun. Having cookie cutter builds handed out to you is boring.<br />
<br />
It depends on what you count as your performance, none of the choices will make a significant difference to your HPS or DPS but can make a huge difference to your performance. With shaman I can't see any tier that will have as large a difference as speccing into telluric currents currently has, which is a bit disappointing. But then again I know shaman who had telluric currents who didn't cast lightning bolt and it didn't really make any difference to their performance. <br />
<br />
Working out when its best to put that left over point in cleansing waters rather than acuity is not interesting. Out of the 6 valid shaman resto specs there are 2 interesting choices, if you should go for telluric current and if you should go for ghost wolf. Everything else is either mandatory or boring. Out of the first 20 points you put into resto shaman spec 19 are mandatory and without them you seriously gimp yourself, having 1 point to play with is not interesting. After that you have 11 mandatory points in the resto tree which opens up the other trees, from there you get to choose if you want to get elemental precision, if you do then all of you have no choice where to put your points.<br />
<br />
So 1 viable spec has 1 boring choice in it.<br />
<br />
If you decide not to go with elemental precision then you have to put 5 points into the elemental tree, many see this as mandatory which makes elemental precision not viable. So you now have 5 points, however, all of the places you can put the points require multiple points to be worthwhile (1 point in telluric currents for example is a waste, you either go all or nothing) So you can pick 2 from a list of 5 abilities: focused insight, telluric currents, ancestral swiftness, totemic reach, cleansing waters. As far as i'm concerned the only interesting ones are telluric currents, ancestral swiftness and to a lesser extent focused insight. You then put any left over points into acuity. <br />
<br />
So I've made one boring choice to get access to the top of the resto tree, I've then made a couple of interesting choices with my left over points. Only 1 of those choices (getting telluric currents or not) is more interesting than the new talent system. Not every tier is going to be an interesting choice, on certain bosses there wont be any choice for a tier. But, except for the very rare pure tank and spank fight, my talent choices are going to be more interesting than the current system. <br />
<br />
Plus I get to make those choices between wipes, without having to hearth and get summoned back. In the past when working on a new progression boss I've adjusted my spec very slightly each night to see if I can make a tiny difference, I can now do it multiple times a night which is great.<br />
<br />
Obviously this is from a PvE point of view.<br />

It's not exactly a lie, it's bending the truth.

The point is, you don't have to say &quot;Yes, we'll do that,&quot; but there are more polite ways of saying &quot;No, we won't.&quot; It's about tact and the simple provision of respectful customer service. Moreover, I think the point that most people here are making when they say that &quot;You're wrong&quot; is the wrong thing to say, those individuals aren't saying that Blizzard CAN'T say it, they're saying Blizzard SHOULDN'T say it. Their method escalates the issue, whereas a more diplomatic route has the potential to leave all parties feeling satisfied with the outcome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2011-12-09, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on what you count as your performance, none of the choices will make a significant difference to your HPS or DPS but can make a huge difference to your performance. With shaman I can't see any tier that will have as large a difference as speccing into telluric currents currently has, which is a bit disappointing. But then again I know shaman who had telluric currents who didn't cast lightning bolt and it didn't really make any difference to their performance. <br />
<br />
Working out when its best to put that left over point in cleansing waters rather than acuity is not interesting. Out of the 6 valid shaman resto specs there are 2 interesting choices, if you should go for telluric current and if you should go for ghost wolf. Everything else is either mandatory or boring. Out of the first 20 points you put into resto shaman spec 19 are mandatory and without them you seriously gimp yourself, having 1 point to play with is not interesting. After that you have 11 mandatory points in the resto tree which opens up the other trees, from there you get to choose if you want to get elemental precision, if you do then all of you have no choice where to put your points.<br />
<br />
So 1 viable spec has 1 boring choice in it.<br />
<br />
If you decide not to go with elemental precision then you have to put 5 points into the elemental tree, many see this as mandatory which makes elemental precision not viable. So you now have 5 points, however, all of the places you can put the points require multiple points to be worthwhile (1 point in telluric currents for example is a waste, you either go all or nothing) So you can pick 2 from a list of 5 abilities: focused insight, telluric currents, ancestral swiftness, totemic reach, cleansing waters. As far as i'm concerned the only interesting ones are telluric currents, ancestral swiftness and to a lesser extent focused insight. You then put any left over points into acuity. <br />
<br />
So I've made one boring choice to get access to the top of the resto tree, I've then made a couple of interesting choices with my left over points. Only 1 of those choices (getting telluric currents or not) is more interesting than the new talent system. Not every tier is going to be an interesting choice, on certain bosses there wont be any choice for a tier. But, except for the very rare pure tank and spank fight, my talent choices are going to be more interesting than the current system. <br />
<br />
Plus I get to make those choices between wipes, without having to hearth and get summoned back. In the past when working on a new progression boss I've adjusted my spec very slightly each night to see if I can make a tiny difference, I can now do it multiple times a night which is great.<br />
<br />
Obviously this is from a PvE point of view.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I am not getting you but... you mean there is no difference but in MoP you just don't have to click those mandatory talents? But isn't that just more fun, to find out what is best and to play around with your talents, instead of getting a cookie cutter build right from the start?<br />
Theorycrafting is part of the game. Having to find out what works best is part of the game. It's fun to do. It doesn't matter if you had cookie cutter builds already.<br />
<br />
And what are you going to change in your spec? Are you going to change up Elemental Mastery, Nature's Swiftness and Echo of Elementals which will all have the same dps increase probably. Maybe Elemental Mastery will give you that little boost in burst damage. Well, it will be a very small difference... Just like the healing talents you get at level 60. Or you change snares. Like it matters with 9 or 24 other players in your group who will bring nearly the exact same skills to the raid.<br />
You see, it doesn't matter in MoP what you spec. You get 3 talents every 15 levels which all give nearly the same results = NOT FUN.<br />
<br />
That's why TBC was so much fun. You actually brought something to the group that mattered. It wasn't perfect but it was fun.<br />
They are now making the whole game 'cookie cutted'. Just like the new quests. I understand it's convenient and maybe less frustrating because they are now all in the same place and easy to find etc. but it also makes the game boring. Three different difficulties is convenient but boring. It's much more fun to raid from tier to tier instead of from difficulty to difficulty and do the same bosses over and over again.<br />
<br />
I really hope their accessibilty approach is going to fail hard because it's incredibly boring. There should be a good balance and I don't believe this is it.<br />

Compare the amount of balance patches per expansion to each other.<br />
Compare the degree of those changes per expansion.<br />
<br />
Looking at each like this, it is clear that blizzard has completely lost touch with how to balance their game. I have not played Cata, but lurked this site for the entirety. Every week I read about X ability being completely changed or Y ability's coefficient being massively adjusted.<br />
<br />
And this is after supposedly &quot;fixing&quot; the stat system...which was broke 1 tier into content.<br />
<br />
They haven't a clue what they are doing. They have taken the easy route and just decided to continually change the &quot;rules&quot; of each class constantly, in hopes it'll keep people quite.<br />
<br />
Core issues are either ignored (Paladin mechanics) or removed from the game (Druid shapeshifting bonuses).<br />
<br />
I won't even bother lurking during MoP, there's no point.<br />
<br />
This whole balancing thing got out of hand. It's ridiculous how many changes they make every time. I didn't PvP but I guess it's one hell of a job to keep track of all the changes. It matters less what other classes can do in PvE.<br />
They should make far less changes and just stick with something. Who cares if one class is top dps in tier 1 but in tier 3 it's lowest for a while. If that's a long term problem then come with a good solution instead of adding 3% damage to a skill and then next week drop it back to 2% and then after a month make it 5% or just let it be. Stupid balancing is ruining the game and it's never ever going to be balanced anyway. That's also the reason why they simplify everything so it's easier to balance but also makes it boring as hell.</div></div><hr />

I would love to have seen how the game would be right now if the 'A' team never left and this failure of a lead dev was never put in charge. I know that I and my guild would probably still be playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
And simply for P.R. reasons if nothing else, if i were in charge right now watching my game crash and burn, i would immediately fire GC and put someone else in charge. And do it publicly with lots of noise so the player base understands that blizz knows they screwed up and they are working to fix things. Honestly that should have been one of the first things they did once it was confirmed that hundreds of thousands of people were quitting the game the beginning of this year. There seems to be no one in charge out there with any kind of business sense, leaving this guy in charge and letting him put out posts like this is the absolute worst thing this company could be doing.<br />

Talent choices might not have been all that meaningful or noticeable but it gave you something to do when you hit a level, and a feeling of power gained (change being made). At this point with their push to endgame it makes the entire revamp of all the old world content in Cataclysm irrelevent. They don't want people to roll and enjoy alts, they want people to just blast through content and get to endgame where apparently the game begins (which many players have felt, and apparently now Blizzard is making 'real').<br />
<br />
The real side effect of this is they will continue to lose more people (because the game is stale at this point and all the major lore characters killed or friendly) and new people will not stick around because the game doesn't reward them enough for playing.</div></div><hr />

Its actually spot on. Your irrational hatred or anger doesn't qualify as fact nor does it disqualify my analogy. Your lack of understanding of the current trees and the future ones is also not my responsibility.<br />
<br />
We have no choice now if we want to compete at a reasonable level. That means there's no real options now. Saying there is, is well, a lie. Come MoP we will have some actual choices to make. Just like my analogy, those choices will be dependent on what we want to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

So true. Lets look at what they have told us every 15 levels you get 3 choices. That is it no more no less. If they want it to be interesting, when I turn 30 you let me choose those 3 options or the previous 2 from 15 than I have 5 choices. <br />
<br />
Also I love the section about how you will be unable to theory craft. LOL! I am pretty sure elitist jerk will have a max dps spec up by the end of day 1 of MoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are no more then 1-4 choices now. That averages a choice every 30 levels. With every new character I start leveling, the first thing I do is read the Elitist Jerks page on the class/spec I'm playing, then I google search the spec to verify the consensus on what is available on EJ. Your choice are pick your own sub-optional talents that will cause you to under perform or choose to follow the cookie cutter.<br />
<br />
I'll try to make a little better analogy to one posted earlier. In Cataclysm the choices are:<br />
<br />
1) $100<br />
2) $75<br />
3) $25 a period for 3 period<br />
4) $50<br />
5) $15 a period for 3 period<br />
<br />
Seems like a lot of choices, but I personally see only 1 correct answer there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I love the section about how you will be unable to theory craft. LOL! I am pretty sure elitist jerk will have a max dps spec up by the end of day 1 of MoP.<br />
<br />
There are very few talents in MoP that can be theorycrafted for optimal DPS in all roles &amp; encounters. The abilities that have been theorycrafted are already baked into the build and we still get them. There are a few talents that will be theorycrafted as must take for certain specs, but those are the minority. The majority of the talents are for utility and the value of the utility depends on what you are doing, so there can't be 1 right answer for those.<br />

Bullshit Blizz, there are CLEAR choices for most spec's. The ones which are not clear choices simply don't MATTER that much.<br />
<br />
Can you provide an example?<br />
<br />
For my example, I'm looking at the Hunter tree, and only the level 15 and 75 options have clear DPS increase abilities. The remaining tiers are for CC, damage reduction, and escape.</div></div><hr />
