Weekly Bonus Event - Legion Dungeons<br />
The Legion Dungeon Event is live this week!<br />
<br />
<br />
You will get one extra piece of loot from the final dungeon boss on difficulties below Mythic+.<br />
Pick up Emissary of War (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) from Archmage Timear (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) in Dalaran to earn Cache of Antoran Treasures (http://www.wowdb.com/items/153501-cache-of-antoran-treasures)<br />
This quest requires you to clear 4 Mythic(+) dungeons and rewards Heroic Antorus loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder to queue for any Legion dungeon on Normal or Heroic difficulty. Alternately, get a group of veteran dungeoneers together and travel to one of the Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) for you. Or, if you forget to pick it up there, you can start it from within the Adventure Journal. <br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Complete 4 Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Rewards: One loot box containing a piece of gear from Heroic difficulty Antorus. <br />
<br />
Passive bonus: The final boss in each dungeon drop additional loot on all difficulties (except Mythic Keystone difficulties). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Brawl - Gravity Lapse<br />
Defy the law of gravity in this week’s PvP Brawl: Gravity Lapse! <br />
<br />
Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool (hotkey “I”) in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. Here are just a few of the Brawls you can look forward to:<br />
<br />
Gravity Lapse<br />

<br />
Gravity getting you down? Step into the Eye of the Storm and be prepared for a whole new en-lighten-ing experience. Every minute, players on the battlefield will find themselves launched into the air, only to gently fall toward the ground again in a perpetual aerial ballet as they try to accrue enough resources to take the win home for their team.</div></div><hr />
