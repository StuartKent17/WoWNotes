PvE tokens for PvP items !<br />
Gates are now opened on the US PvE test realm, a few more vendors are available and it looks like you will be able to :<br />
Use Tier 4 Armor Tokens to buy Season 1 Gladiator set.<br />
Use Tier 5 and Tier 6 Armor Tokens to buy Season 2 Gladiator set.<br />
Use [item=29434] to buy Season 2 &quot;honor&quot; armor. (40 badges for boots and belts, 25 for bracers) <br />
Use your Tier 6 Sunwell Armor tokens to buy season 3 belt/bracers/boots. <br />

Sunwell &quot;badge&quot; loot<br />
It looks like another batch of Sunwell loot is available with the opening of the gate on the US PvE servers. These items are now &quot;activated&quot; on the server but we don't know yet how players are supposed to get them.<br />

I personally like the change, because it opens Arenas up to my mage finally, my mage is in decent PvE gear but is unable to get into arenas because no one will accept an S1 Mage into their team on my server xD so it gives me the option of spending my badges on at least S2 gear now.</div></div><hr />

Because the game revolves around PvP right? You can earn your way up the PvE ladder from nothing, you jump into PvP without good gear, you are screwed and get nowhere fast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolrajh</div><div class="date">2008-02-16, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't see it mentionned yet, but you might find interesting to hear that PVP gear obtained with outland reputation vendors need only to be &quot;honored&quot; with the appropriate faction in order to buy the piece. I mean, even for chest, legs and head. Don't know when it was changed, I just got on the EU pvp ptr and saw this...<br />
<br />
Along with the repeatable BG marks quest for 314 honor, it's becoming quite easy to get a decent pvp gear to start. Especially for rerolls : I used to play on a pve server and get bored, so I rerolled same class on a pvp server. But since we are now some way in S3, winning BGs or trying to keep a decent arena rating is VERY hard and frustrating. Nerf those S2/S3 guys who just don't know how to improve themselves...<br />
<br />
Anyway, for about... 50 or 60 gold, you can get yourself full geared up, with 2 and 4 pieces set bonus, and even get a decent look ( re-colored outlands dungeon class set ).<br />
<br />
Yet about the news changes concerning pve-tokens and pvp-stuff ... I think like Wildhorn : why are they allowing pve players to get some quick start in the pvp world, while nothing is done to help pvp players getting back on trails for instancing? Arena stuff is good, but not really adapted to high end raiding. We all know that. And we also know that high end raiding gear is not meant to be used in pvp. So what works a way should work in the other too. Give us warlocks more spellhit items with honor! :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because those raids still have to *kill* something. I can lose 10 arena games per week. Or simply /afk in AV and get PVP gear. What does it matter if I can now get PVP gear from killing a raid boss? <br />
<br />
Do you have issues with 0-10 teams getting the same gear?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolrajh</div><div class="date">2008-02-16, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It matters in the way that, when you get pvp gear without deserving it ( let's say it this way for now ), you add to the S2/S3 unskilled teams flooding the brackets up to about 1800, thus preventing emerging players to rise. I mean, the more players acquire pvp gear, although they don't know how to actually play in pvp, the more difficult it becomes to rise. There always is a limit to which stuff is superior to skill : too much resilience, too much HP, too much AP/spelldamage... With time passing, the true &quot;starting rating&quot; if I cant put it this way, decreases. A newcomer will probably struggle to keep a 1500+ rating with minimum resilience, and he will most probably fall down to lower ratings where he will stabilize. While being very frustrating to loose and loose and get a bad rating, it also reduces the arena points earned, and thus increases the time necessary to get a single item...<br />
Now just imagine you add more opponents in the melee, stuffed with S2 only by raiding... Those people probably won't have a clue about what to do in pvp but they will still be stuffed and crush beginners and then congratZ themselves about how pimp and skilled they are...<br />
<br />
Let's face it. PvE stuff is for raiding and PvEing in general. PvP stuff is for PvPing. I find interesting that you mention the fact that people can afk in BG : this is a strict pvp issue. I think that the PvP scene is badly hit enough by this : no need to add pve players here.<br />
PvE players that want PvP arena stuff should get it by losing their 10 matches a week, whining about how long it takes to gather enough points to buy their beloved S2 weapons, and let true pvp players get to higher rankings by bouncing on them. In no way should PvPers get lower ratings by being blocked by PvErs. I will go further and remind that pve-players can get pve stuff by raiding AND get pvp stuff in the spare time ( you said it : 10 matches a week, 1 to 2 hours! ), but deep pvpers can't get any pve items. So much for putting diversity in the game, if only pve players can actually get advantages of this.<br />
<br />
So, giving away T4/T5 to PvPers is about as silly as giving away S1/S2 and even S3 to raiders. Why not then?<br />
<br />
( And now to add to the general confusion, how many players do you think will actually get S2/S3 with raid tokens? I mean, will really raids go back to SSC/TK while they are farming BT/Hyjal/SP just to get some fracking pvp stuff ? And will raids that are just discovering SSC/KT really spend their first and later tokens to get pvp items instead of going straight to T5 to improve their chances? I doubt so... <br />

<br />
Raiders will have the best PvE gear from BT/Sunwell, and now they will also have the best PvP gear in a much, much shorter time than PvP players will have.<br />
<br />
Assuming someone has 0 arena points and has 1500 rating in their arena teams, is in a guild that clears Hyjal/Black Temple in a week. You can get all 5 badges in one week, and get full Season 3 gear in one week. How many Season 3 items can a PvP'er get in one week starting with the same arena points? Not only that, the PvP shoulders have a rating requirement.......<br />
<br />
Once again, we go back to where the PvE'ers will be able to steamroll everyone in PvP. It used to be the Naxx geared players owning battlegrounds, and thanks to BC, PvP gear was a lot better for PvP, but what's that? Blizzard is going to spoon feed raiders again by handing them the best PvP gear just by doing something they would normally do?<br />
Apparently you missed the part where it said the turnins are for **SEASON 2** PVP gear. Who gives a crap about last year's slop. It's not &quot;the best&quot; gear. This effort by Blizzard to obviously encourage it's raiding community to participate in arena PVP won't accomplish anything. Nobody wants last season's PVP gear when it's not that hard to farm an average 1600-1700 rated 5v5 and get Season 3 gear.

Compare actual Badge Loot to T4 Raid Instance rewards and you will see, that this gear is better but expensive (Pants, 75 Badges...). So let's assume you go Kara, that gives you 22 badges. So you got 22 badges but need (i expect 100+ token for new stuff) a lot more. So where is the problem with Mechanaar. You get 4 badges for one Mecha run, so that would be 25 runs in Mecha, which is 25 days, which is nearly four weeks. Well have fun with one item then. <br />
And for karazhan. I only yawn myself through karazhan for damn [item=29434], if i decide to go there or help or whatever. ;) <br />

<br />
The former is NEVER going to cost JUST [item=29434] , they won't let BT gear be obtainable from just running heroic mechanaar.<br />
If they did, it would pretty much depracate the entire loottable from karazhan, and most of SSC/TK loots.<br />
<br />
That would be such a waste.<br />
<br />
<br />
If anything, the vendors' wares will have to be unlocked through the rep and access grind and the gear will probably cost 1 Sunmote + 2-3x the cost of existing badge gear.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, as indicated in the patch notes, some of the &quot;badge&quot; armor you can purchase will REQUIRE the turn in of an existing armor drop off the Sunwell bosses for exchange. We don't know for sure yet if the same will be applied to these weapons.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand I wouldn't be surprised that these items are indeed all from badges. Maybe required exalted with the new faction and then double the cost of the ZA set rewards. <br />

Blizzard gave away items of t5 quality from badges to get people to progress into SSC and TK or even the last push to kill Kaelthas and Vasjh. Maybe now they give t6 quality stuff to get people into Hyal and BT and maybe help to improve gear for Sunwell.</div></div><hr />

Yea thats not what I said, I said start out both in low gear, see who gets farther in 2 months.<br />
<br />
PvP sadly has become entirely gear dependent, so these changes allow people who missed seasons 1 and 2 (and alts) to finally jump into the ring with full season 2, instead of getting rejected by all teams for having Season 1.<br />
<br />
PvE is a ladder, you can start out with bad gear and work your way up, that will never change your progress and you can't get rejected for Kara (the start of the ladder technically) with bad gear (unless you have REALLY bad gear.. then thats a different story).<br />
<br />

The weapons do have an Item Level between Hyjal/BT bosses and Archimonde/Illidan, but they're designed in a way to be worse than Hyjal/BT bosses' weapons and S3 weapons still.<br />
1h Heal Mace - Missing MP5/spirit for PvE, quite decent for PvP but missing resilience<br />
2h Axe- Worst weapon type for warriors in PvE and PvP, faster than BT/Hyjal and S3 2h weapons, no stamina for PvP, only better than Hyjal/BT loot for horde retribution paladins maybe<br />
1h Fist Weapons - Worse specc than swords for PvE and worse than maces and swords for PvP, slow 1h weapons are faster than all slow BT/Hyjal and S3 weapons while the fast offhand is slower than BT/Hyjal and S3 weapons<br />
1h Caster Dagger - Like 1h Healing Mace, just that it's missing spellcrit and spellhit instead of Mp5/Spirit<br />
1h Daggers - Just like the Fist Weapons with the additional deficit of having Stamina instead of DPS-Stats for PvE<br />
2h Crossbow - for Hunters it depends on their specc and current haste how good it is<br />
<br />
BT/Hyjal farm guilds will use the new Badges' Weapons mostly for their Stats as the Crossbow for example is probably the best ranged weapon for Rogues and Offwarriors currently ingame.</div></div><hr />

Badge loot better than FOUR other instances, and ALL HEROICS is just lame. No it's actually lamer than lame, it's directly stupid and gamebreaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you missed the fact that such badge loot is already in game, and it has not broken anything yet? Go look at the badge loot that was added in 2.3, it's iLevel 128 and better than the gear in Karazhan, Magtheridon, Gruul, and ALL HEROICS. It is superior in some ways to gear in SSC/TK.<br />

I don't understand this mentality, it's just sad to me. No one is really whining about access to BT gear, it's the exact opposite. This will be one of (if not thee) last patch before WotLK.

Arena is a VERY small part of early resil-pvp gearing. That's the whole point behind putting season 1 in for honor.

I got my alt (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Gurubashi&amp;n=Skilledcoil)to ~360resil in less than 2 months from hitting 70.

The chances of that happening or so slim. Besides, running kara will only get you the head and gloves options. I believe they are working token pieces by the slot, not just any token for any slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your raid in &quot;greens &amp; blues&quot; can go kill Curator and your raid members want to spend their first Glove Token on PvP gloves that are the EASIEST piece of S1 gear to get then your raid is going to fail. Only extreme cases where T4 is out-paced by non-set epics would it be okay to just trade in your tokens for an easy piece of PvP gear. If you can't grind out the honor and tokens for your head piece and gloves (oh noes, not a 2 piece set +35 resil!), then you really shouldn't be gearing for PvP in the first place.<br />
<br />
It will be even easier when 2.4 hits and everyone can purchase rep PvP gear &amp; trade in their 100 BG tokens for easy honor.<br />
<br />
If the QQers want to get upset about something they should, at the very least, consider how ridiculous it would be for a &quot;newb&quot; raid to go in and kill Curator only to turn in tokens for PvP gear. The T4 gear would be a raiding upgrade for almost all the classes and a serious raid leader would kick their asses for spending a token on S1 bullshit gloves.</div></div><hr />

And iknow alot of raiders who quit in TBC, because they didden't like the attitude towards raiding compared to vanilla WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have an advice for you mate. Go try to play some Real Life. You seem to fair obsessed by a game.<br />
<br />
First what is the problem in more guilds seeing end Raid content? Blizzard is helping them with the gear. This gear is not the Best, there is better in BT/Hyjal even ZA and the new Sunwell Raid. So if you want to be the best geared you still will be if you are there with the best progressing guilds.<br />
<br />
What will this make is making easier to pass Vashj for a lot of Guilds and Kaelthas. Now.. This will take a least 1 more month (or 2...) on PTR's so it will take substantial time to arrive. And They won't be free. I would assume if this is really badge rewards this is going to cost at least 120 Badges for Weapons for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding been a challenge in coordination , and the gear been a nessary timesink. Picking up the right gear, socket it right, enchanting it right been part of the personal evolution your character has in WoW.<br />
The removal of all that is difficult and exclusive makes the game alot less interesting. Hyjal was only interesting because it was locked away.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong being obsessed about a hobby you put many hours into, and enjoy. But as I said, the game changes, resulting in making groups of people less happy about it. Raiding is just silly now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really think it's time for u to take a break from WoW, in case ur serious with all the stuff u post. Anyway...BC is almost over and so Blizz is tossing around free epics...not a big deal i think</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll give a few examples for the rogueclass since thats the class I play and know best.<br />
<br />
The ranged weapon, leggings, belt, chest and the ring are better then the nonset stuff that drops in Hyal and BT. ( with the ring I ofcourse mean the ring from hyal reputation and not the stormrage signet ring)<br />
The boots from current badges are also better then the 2 you can get from BT and Hyal so that means that only counting rogues around 8 drops from 14 the current 2 hardest dungeons are made useless....<br />
<br />
If its anything like that for other classes its gonna be alot of cursing and disenchanting in 2.4 I bet. Maybe from now on items can be disenchanted in badges? ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheColtrain</div><div class="date">2008-02-17, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is my first post ever, we shal see how the world accepts it...<br />
<br />
WoW is a game, and in my mind a very good game. It houses a large demographic of people, and does cater to each of their needs. I play on a server with BT clear and a number of guilds that have it on farm. I belong to a guild that is still trying to get though SSC (oh no we must be noobz!)<br />
<br />
There will always be people who complain about a change, becasue every change throws off the balance of something. I see a lot of posts about how the dropping of attunements is lame... but for serious raiders, would the thrill not be the clear and the access, but the first clear, the better gear and being the first to have it? For those hardcore raiders, while the rest of WoW gets their first look at SSC bosses and BT pugs, they get to run the new end game content, which is the thrill for them.<br />
<br />
As far as loot goes, its just like buying a new car. The moment you get it theres going to be something better right around the corner. Having better gear lets you feel better about your character, make runs easier, and allows you to be more helpful to the guild in their progression.<br />
<br />
Things do get easier as we go along in the game, and it becomes a delicate balance of where to spend time. Really why is there any point in playing the game when you hit 70? You could just freeze the account untill WotLK comes out and pick up from there. But the fact is that at 70 you get to access the truly fun parts of the game. And I enjoy working for the stuff that I get. I have full S2 and some of S3, but I dont care that is will be easier to get one day, becasue I have it now.<br />
<br />
One more point to hit on about the QQing (as it is said). There will always be someone who dosn't like whats been said or what is going to happen... but if those people really want to make a stand they would not play the game, or protest against the changes in a constructive manner, not tab out to see whos replied to this or any other thread :p<br />
<br />
<br />
All and all I can really only say one thing about 2.4<br />
<br />
I am STOKED to get some better gear so I can enjoy all the pre-be content even more! 45 min solo baron runs are WAY more fun than Kara to me... and I dont care what anyone thinks of me! :P</div></div><hr />

Blizard doesnt give free gear to anyone. If by now you havent seen the pattern that Blizzard has adopted, release high end content for 12 months then let everyone else catch up by making gear achievement easier, then frankly, you're a moron.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not.... the 2% of the player base that have killed Illidan do not pay for the server farms.... the other 98% do. I really wish we could ship off all the &quot;elite&quot; &quot;hardcore&quot; players off to their own servers and let them be funded by their &quot;brothers&quot;. I wonder then if they'd realise just why they need the other 98% to stay interested in the game.<br />

As for PVE---&gt;PVP tokens. I wouldnt worry about the change too much. Most raiders in my Guild, yes i'm one of the 2%, couldn't PVP their way out of a wet paper bag.<br />

didn't exist. Who's the moron now?<br />

<br />
I wish people still stuck in Kara like you, would just shut up if they have no idea what they are talking about. People who worked hard to kill Vashj and Kael get rewarded with lifted attunements so that every scrub guild can &quot;see new content&quot;. Do they need that? They have still new content in SSC and TK to do, why do they need new content in Hyjal and beyond? But that's not enough, no, skipping content is only one part, let's hand them BT quality loot, so that they can even skip gearing up. Brilliant, and very motivating to continue to raid. <br />

you cant compare naxx to bt, because you clearly see that bt is NOT the top of the iceberg. sunwell will be. i dont think if sunwell is the last raid, it will be nerfed at all. blizzs policy is it to enable a broad auidence to do the raid instances. an advantadge, vanilla wow didnt have. all you get for beating the bosses while they are still hard is respect from the other players (or hopefully not) and the good feeling of a big epeen. wheres your problem in letting other players catch up content in a version that is easier as the one you managed to beat?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This change is beyond silly, makes the 1500-1600s even worse. <br />
<br />
<br />
Actually I think this change is pointless.<br />
<br />
Ain't no 10/25 man capable guilds is gonna let their guildies use the tokens pvp armors (and that's subpar last season stuff as well).<br />
<br />
If they are going to use it such a way the tokens just would be given to someone who is lesser geared.<br />
<br />
And if everyone is already geared in t4/t5/t6 anyways they would stop doing that instances.<br />
<br />
So the entire idea is pointless and a distraction for raiding pvers, just as if being able to get pve gear from bg/arena pts is a distraction for hardcore pvpers. <br />
<br />
In addition if they get the gear, it is quite pointless for them to just use it for casual pvp (you beat a few weak guys in world pvp, they call or you attracted some of their pro-pvper friends in s3 set, you get owned and feel bad. Kinda stupid at the end of the day). If they are going to do arena with it, then they might as well just use arena points instead lol. It is a lot cheaper.<br />
<br />
Blizzard logic fails at failing.</div></div><hr />

I had a lot of griping about casuals, but I just don't care anymore. The attunement drops aren't really going to affect my progress in any way. Those that get to taste the new content they were previously excluded from and move upward, more power to them. Those that were 'tards and failed miserably before are in for a rude awakening if they think it's a freebie handout. <br />
<br />
In short, removing the attunements doesn't make BT/Hyjal any less of a skill check for those who were already struggling greatly in TK/SSC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardcore players also have to realize that commitment fluctuates too. It's something I lost sight of for a while and only gained sight of it again as my RL schedule gets busier.<br />
<br />
Most casuals inevitably want to step up and go hardcore in some facet of the game if their RL circumstances can permit such a level of commitment. Conversely, you will have hardcore players that burn out and slowly step back into a more casual approach to the game.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you're a hardcore raider still griping about this attunement lift, you should seriously consider your guild's place on your server's progression pecking order. A good deal of guilds that have had BT/Hyjal on farm for months don't care about the attunement lift. Their status symbols aren't measured by the gear they get, but the bragging rights they acquire for mastering the content in relatively short time. <br />
<br />
The epiphany I've gotten so far from personal experience and from observing the other cries here is that the outcry is mostly based in the outlandish insecurity of a remote possibility that a guild of &quot;scrubs&quot; could possibly surpass one's own guild on the progression ladder. If that's the case, you shouldn't be crying about keeping things segregated to preserve a misbegotten sense of elitism; you should be looking for a better guild.</div></div><hr />
