I'm nervous and excited for WoTLK, but still sad about the state of some of the classes that I play. I am -NOT- looking forward to rerolling. Though the Deathknight should be an interesting class to play and learn to master. Much more complicated to play -WELL- than most I would imagine.</div></div><hr />

Because it was copied from tier6. The pimpest looking gear in classic dropped from naxx (except judgement) and so it follows logically that the best looking gear in lich king will probably drop from the hardest instance, maybe icecrown citadel?

<br />
Having the weapons and shoulders have stringent restrictions is good and I like it. It makes a graphical appearance difference between the very skilled and the common arena players. It keeps PvE players from just grinding out 3600 ap to get some of the best weapons in the game. But what it also does is allow people to compete in arena going against others who are much more on par with their gear-level. A player with inferior shoulders and weapons will still be able to defeat a player with both of those item slots better through skill.<br />
<br />
As this stands though, the high end set will be inaccessable to players who can't surpass the rating thresholds and will contribute to rating sales and the absurd population of full s4 players who spend their time in the 1500-2000 range to earn gold. What this does in the long run is create glass ceilings that will be unsurpassable.</div></div><hr />

IMO, season 2 looked better for a lot of classes, most notably Warlock and Warrior. A lot of people preffered S2 hunter and mage sets compared to S3, as well.<br />

S3 was superior for rogues and priests in terms of looks, however.</div></div><hr />

I think that should be 12000 HP like the 2h'ers, and the lower tier savage. <br />
<br />
Savage 2h = 12000<br />
Savage ranged = 12000<br />

I really think, like you, the rewards for extreme levels of PvP prowess should be awesome. However like you I'm worried that they are becoming increasingly decisive - ie. gear, not skill, is becoming the determining factor. The min requirement for s6.2 (s6.0, s6.1 and s6.2 for reference) is 1900; most gear has a 2080 requirement on it.<br />
<br />
This equates to the top ~1% of arena players. However using the Warlock as an example the differences in s6.1 and s6.2 are as follows:<br />
<br />
Stam: 57 (570 health)<br />
Int: 23 (345 mana)<br />
Spell dmg: 55<br />
Crit: 32<br />
Res: 31<br />
<br />
That is a % increase of 10-14% on all stats. So not only do I have to beat someone who is better than me, but I have to beat them by a margin of 10%. I'm all for rating requirements, just soften the gear differentiation.</div></div><hr />

I agree too... but from the opposite perspective ;)<br />

Personally i would have made it so that u must get 75% of the winning score to get even 1 mark example: WSG 2/3 for 1 mark. AB/EOTS 1500 / 2000 for 1 mark, AV Not sure how to work that one maybe kill ball/galv at least... Currently this is easy for most of horde because they play to win, allot of alliance play for free epix..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm stuck with using blue PvP items for battlegrounds/world PvP because I can't get 1600+ rating in Arenas. Sorry, I don't have the time to invest in playing arenas by the books, and I play my 10 arena matches with friends. I don't really care to do normal group comps of rogue/mage/priest, and I'm equally sick of every druid/X combo. But the composition of my team and my opponent's team (and the broken personal rating system) is irrelevant. What is relevant is the rating requirement on items.<br />
<br />
1725 rating to get Hateful chest piece? 2020 to get Deadly chest piece?<br />
<br />
Comparing the full Deadly mage set to the Savage set, for instance, yields:<br />
<br />
71 more armor, 1710 more health, 135 less mana, 115 more spell power, 66 more spell critical, and 44 more resilience.<br />
<br />
The only parts that matter there are the high increases in stamina and spell power. Yes, it's high ilevel gear, but it's also ridiculously hard to achieve. I don't have time to play against 2000+ rated teams who enjoy rerolling. I don't enjoy playing against Duelists/Rivals who spend their entire day doing arena matches, when I'm only in 1550 bracket.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll just PvP in raid gear.</div></div><hr />

except that the BG gear (savage) doesnt take rating. Just arena points (plus honor of course). Check again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference that I calculated was (6.2 v 6.1) for the mage set was much more noticible:<br />
<br />
Stam: 751 v 667 = 84<br />
damage: 674 v 592 = 82<br />
crit: 351 v 301 = 50<br />
resil: 409 v 322 = 48<br />
<br />
The percentage differences vary from 12% to 17% which *is* a very large discrepancy. Think of it this way, it's not all averaged, its more additive. Can you see yourself defeating someone who has 14% more life, is 14% more resiliant (takes that much less damage), and is critting you 14% more for 14% more damage? It's night and day difference.<br />
<br />
That's what I mean in glass ceiling. People who don't start at the beginning of the season will never catch up, and people who are ahead one season to the next will be unsurpassable. All it will do is perpetuate rating selling.<br />
<br />
Unless they change the matchmaking to also consider what gear people have, and/or queue based on the highest personal rating of anyone on the team. <br />
<br />
This is why I liked the system wherein the most visually impacting item (shoulders) and the most powerful item (weapon) were the only ones with rating requirements. That season even if you weren't the upper echelon you were still on a fairly even ground with the top players and it created an environment where you could win through skill in the arena rather than have it be solely gear based.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
And think about all the poor saps who were talked into starting for the recruit a friend deal who get into the arena season a month late. Not one chance in hell to catch up.<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't mind losing to someone better than me (and who happens to look much cooler in their well earned gears). But losing to someone who is only slightly better than me, but I outplayed, bcause they have a substantial gear gap (compared to only slightly now) is bullocks. <br />

Despite the fact I have 380 res and can beat just about any class 1vs1, people &quot;think&quot; Ferals suck so I get denied for any half decent teams. For now I'm content with being able to get the best I can through honor and can at least stay competitive in BG's, but what to do when I can't earn AP for the new stuff because my spec makes people think I suck for arenas? Please don't tell me to spec Resto, I don't want to heal. <br />

<br />
Why do you assume someone AFKS in AV for honor? I have never once AFKed in a battleground. Time has nothing to do with it. There are limitations for certain group compositions currently, and maybe this will change in 3.0. Right now, druids make up 75% of the top 2v2 teams. And people who get high into ratings get bored and reroll teams, but their personal ratings don't stay with them. You call me a scrub, but I simply refuse to play with a flawed arena system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still complete shit that I'll be stuck in blues for World PvP because I don't/can't do Arenas.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that, as others and myself have noted, the blues are substationally inferior to the epics that require insanely high ratings. I thought the arena ratings were pretty fair in season 4, but this is crazy. And it's crap that people who don't do arenas have inferior gear, simply because they don't do arenas, yet they spend ample time in battlegrounds and world PvP.<br />
<br />

About the only way I can see for me to have a chance at lvl 80 would be to rush a team up VERY early, before resilience gear is around in enough amounts to matter, and rely on huge crits on soft targets that will not exist later on. If you could get a big gear advantage early on, you could ride it from that point out. You wont start halfway through a season and do anything ever again. The difference in gear is FAR too great. Someone in savage glad gear will simply get mauled by someone in deadly glad gear. And that person will be stuck in savage glad basically forever, since every ranking from 1450 to 2550 will be flooded with reroll teams and point sellers, all wearing better gear than you. And they wont ever go away. Ever.<br />
<br />
It's a super bad idea to have such a huge gap in gear quality in the FIRST lvl 80 season. For gods sake, theres a 149 damage difference between the top end of the savage glad and the deadly glad 2 hand maces. AND, the greatest sin of all, the deadly gear has more resilience, so not only are they hitting harder, they are harder to kill.</div></div><hr />

For now I'm content with being able to get the best I can through honor and can at least stay competitive in BG's, but what to do when I can't earn AP for the new stuff because my spec makes people think I suck for arenas? Please don't tell me to spec Resto, I don't want to heal. <br />

What about Prot Pally's or Prot Warriors? Heck, even Enhancement Shamans (at least on live anyway). I truly hope Bliz makes these, and other, specs Arena viable in WoTLK, but even Bliz says some simply won't be viable. And yet they are forcing those specs to do Arena if they want PvP gear despite admitting they suck in Arena.<br />

are you retarded? If you don't want to play a spec which is good in pvp then don't expect to be effective and reap the rewards. PvE is the same, unless you significantly outgear the instance you can't expect to walk in with a raid full of pvp specs and walk out with super phat epic loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imo the entire arena system is flawed. Why do I play FAR more teams geared at least with s4 helm, chest, gloves, pants etc (1700+ rating). When I'm only high enough rating to get s4 pants + gloves? I'm continually stuck at ~ 1550-1600 because I'm playing teams which outgear + outplay me. Thats fine I don't care about losing to higher skilled players here and there but i despise the system which *continually* pits me against teams which simply rape my team - I learn nothing. Why can't blizzard create a league system to more reliably match equal teams against each other?<br />
<br />
It should work similar to soccer leagues. There should be, for example, A League, B League and C League and each has an internal ladder. If a team is continually winning at C League they will move through the ladder and obviously move into B League. If they continue to win they'll move up into league A. If they lose more than win they'll obviously drop down the ladder and move down a league. <br />
<br />
Or they could have it work similar to Soccer where if after a set timeframe (maybe each season or a few times each season?) if a team finishes in the top 10% (for example) of their league they will move up a league. If they finish in the bottom 10% they will move down a league. Or a similar thing could be done simply by rating. Anyone with &gt; 2000 rating is moved to A League after each season (or any timeframe); Anyone between 1750 or 1800 and 2000 moves to B league and anyone &gt; 1750 or 1800 moves down to C League.<br />
<br />
A league will only ever play other A league teams. B league only plays B league teams etc etc...<br />
<br />
This way, especially at the start of each season, my teams with a lowely 1500-&gt;1600 rating can't possibly play any teams not in our league and thus...only play equally geared/skilled teams. Of course i could still come up against newly formed well geared teams but that will be far less often and i'll actually have a chance to learn from the experience rather than just getting frustrated at the continual slaughter.<br />
<br />
Atm imo, the arena system is just completely flawed. If they weren't to introduce something like a league system I'd even prefer that I'm teamed only against equal rating teams and if the matching system can't find any then i'll simply remain in the queue until one is found. I'd FAR prefer NEVER playing a game for 3 hours straight then playing a 1800+ rated team multiple times in a row and going from 1600 &gt; 1500 in a completely unfair match up. <br />
<br />
I mean seriously its like the Brazil national football team playing a teen high school football team, or the New England Patriots playing some rubbish high school american football club. Its a complete waste of time imo.</div></div><hr />

I would preffer something like the way it is handled in WC3, depending on you winning % you are put up against players with equal % so some rerolling 2k team statring of with with 100% vitory after the first game would be less likely to get a team trying to get past 1600 for a while with far less %, but i guess i would create other problems going with that system especeally in addition to the rating and i guess it wont be happening ... but it was nice in wc3 :&gt;</div></div><hr />

I have never once AFKed in a battleground. Time has nothing to do with it. There are limitations for certain group compositions currently, and maybe this will change in 3.0. Right now, druids make up 75% of the top 2v2 teams. And people who get high into ratings get bored and reroll teams, but their personal ratings don't stay with them. You call me a scrub, but I simply refuse to play with a flawed arena system.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that, as others and myself have noted, the blues are substationally inferior to the epics that require insanely high ratings. I thought the arena ratings were pretty fair in season 4, but this is crazy. And it's crap that people who don't do arenas have inferior gear, simply because they don't do arenas, yet they spend ample time in battlegrounds and world PvP.<br />
<br />
What happened to world PvP? Did it die? Not everyone likes arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally agree with you!<br />
<br />
I put much more time into PVP and am more successful in PVP (BGS &amp; World) then any of the Arena players in my server. <br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to give us more options then this...not saying they should make it easy to get gear, imo the should make it hard has hell, just don't force people to go into Arenas!<br />
<br />
Bgs deserve their own epic gear set, which should be just has good has the Arena epic set. But like I said make it hard has hell to get it.<br />
<br />
I would even go has far has saying charge the BG players 75k honour and 100 marks from each BG for one of the items. But first you need to qualify for it, something like having Justicar title or even something like having 100k lifetime kills(or more), Like this it would eliminate AFKers to a certain degree. (they would basically would have to AFK for the rest of their lifes)<br />
<br />
All I am saying is that I am really sick of having nothing to spend all this honor I have, I am forever capped :(</div></div><hr />

Got a Brutal Gladiator Weapon? Congrats on having the skill and gear to reach 2050 - but you'll never, ever, see a team below ~1850 for the rest of that season, no matter what your personal rating drops to, or how many scrub teams pay you to bump their team rating. Keep win/loss changes based on team average personal rating to avoid exploits, but FFS, keep the varsity players(1800-2k+) out of the kiddie pool(1500-1600).<br />
<br />
Sure, say I suck at arena, call me a lols2 noob... but when one out of two teams I fight in the 1500-1600 range has one or both players in full s3/partial s4, the problem isn't me.<br />
<br />
For those that cry about PvE players doing 10 games a week for 'welfare epics', it really has nothing to do with arena. It's more the crap itemization vs. difficulty for most 5-man and heroic 5-man content in TBC. Why sit through 3 hours of hell in Heroic Arc for a chance at an epic dagger when you can get a better one, guaranteed, with just a little time in Arena or BG's every week for a month?<br />
<br />
Final thought, the lack of an 'entry-level' purchasable(or rep-based) set is sort of worrying as well. If Wrath goes live like this, the first 80's(especially those that capped honor/marks pre-wrath) will have a running start that won't ever go away. Having to earn massive amounts of Honor/AP just to get entry-level blue pvp gear so you can start building up your rating and spending even more Honor/AP to upgrade a little higher up the food chain doesn't sound fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emulous</div><div class="date">2008-09-23, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on this information alone I would say. I will not be buying WoTLK.<br />
<br />
1) All 3 sets look basically the same and their 100% generic, recoloured crap!<br />
<br />
2) They have increased the rating requirements on all items.<br />
<br />
3) Judging by this it will take roughly 25-50% longer to obtain each item provided you have the requirements. This will also mean you'll be unable to obtain roughly 25-50% of the gear if your currently stuck at a rating thats under 1900.<br />
<br />
4) It doesnt look like they have made any attempt at balancing classes and combo for the arena / bgs, and from their track record they never will.. So baring that in mind unless your unlucky with your class choice or you reroll 1-80 and then obtain all the above quickly you wont have much fun at all.<br />
<br />
5) I've still have not heard anything about prevents overgeared players steamrolling arenas<br />
<br />
6) Gun turrets, catapults, blowing up buildings? wtf? utter bollocks... it's nothing like what 85% of the PvPers out there have been asking for and imho it sounds hideously bad.<br />
<br />
7) Blizzard are still premoting the PvP-scrub / welfare slogans and boosting and team selling.<br />
<br />
8) WSG, AV, AB still remain old stagant and boring.<br />
<br />
9) They have made very little attempt to premote the horde / ally rivalry or to revent back to smaller battlegrounds groups where you might atleast have a slim chance of playing with and against the same players more then once.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.. 3 and 7 contradict each other.. On one hand, you're not buying wrath because gear is soo much harder to get.. But on the other hand the gear is welfare... hmm<br />

<br />
I think you need to understand the internal logic that is driving Blizzard to do this.<br />
<br />
First, they don't want to have what happened in S1/S2 of BC, where everyone could get arena epics by just putting in time. I think this progressively devalues the PvE content whose loot was being superseded. Blizzard doesn't want this content to become obsolete so quickly, and their solution is to put ratings on the higher tier items to limit who can get it.<br />
<br />
But this solution creates its own problem. If there is nothing for low rated players to get, no carrot on a stick to drive them, they will just stop playing arena. The ladder then progressively collapses, and the high ratings gear also becomes unavailable for most of the players, even skilled ones. It would be worse that S4, since even in S4 low rated players can still get some of the earlier season gear.<br />
<br />
So, Blizzard needs a way to drive scrubs (and I am not excepting myself from that category) into the arena to keep the ladder inflated. The arena point requirement on blue gear serves this purpose.<br />
<br />
I suspect plenty of people complaining about this will end up running insta-lose arena teams, going in for ten losses a week then reforming. Embarrassing and painful, but perhaps less painful than collecting EotS/WSG/AB marks for alliance on many battlegrounps (or AV tokens for horde). These teams will constantly be injecting points into the ladder system.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard really wants scrubs to play arena, they should allow people to completely hide their arena information from public inspection, both in game and in Armory. I am sure fear of ratings ridicule keeps many from doing arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you buy a game for xbox, ps3, etc etc do you complain that you don't get a memory card with the game completed on it? <br />
<br />
<br />
True, but then again only the top 5% of the players who buy xbox games can complete it? and if you buy the game 2-3 months after the release level 1 is 100x harder since you start with a crowbar while the mobs you have to fight used to have crowbars too, now they have sub-mechine guns and crowbar proof jackets, oh and they have an AI that is smarter and faster then you too. Amiright?<br />
<br />
I don't care what you say about this working hard bollocks. The facts are simple it's an elo system and as such it is impossible for everyone to reach the top end of the scale. For every game there is a loser and a winner. There will always be people are the bottom, people in the middle and people at the top.<br />
<br />
And in this sytem the people who are &quot;lesser-skilled&quot; will have to work 10 times harder for gear thats only half as good. All the while having 0 fun.. Because we'll still be doing the same old stagant BG's getting instagibbed by players in better gear with more skill then ourselfs in bgs, arena and world PvP..<br />
<br />
It's a horrid idea and I hate everything about it.. MMO my butt!! I mean we have no options it's play X spec Y class with a A class who's B specced for Z time and we'll give you 70% of you Gloves, Neck, Belt. 50% of you Legs, Chest, Ring. 30% of you Head, Boots 10% Weapons 5% Shoulders...

What is important here is that, we have 3 known tiers of battleground/arena/world pvp earned gear. A game that can never be balanced in every scenario and a bunch of people who have nothing better to do than complain about something that isn't even out yet. ...and yes, i am on beta i know what it is like.<br />
<br />
Lets look at history:<br />
People complained about having to get PVE rep to get PVP blues.... Not anymore<br />
People getting very easily attained epics....Not Anymore<br />
Everyone running around battlegrounds in welfare epics .....Not Anymore<br />
<br />
Now with WotLK<br />
Almost Everyone will be in blues with some epics, only a small amount of people in top tier.<br />
With the new gems, this gap will be lessened. (Seriously, 40+ stam in one gem)<br />
<br />
Now you complain that you are forced to do arenas to get gear. This isn't going to be BC anymore. If you really think of this in the larger scheme of things, it is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Only 5% of the Playerbase will be getting the top gear..... so what, this is only the first season. If you really play better you will make up for that in time. This also means only 5% of the people in battlegrounds will have that gear, meaning many more will not have those welfare epics. Making it &quot;more&quot; of an even playing field. What people do not seem to get in their heads is that this game can not and will not ever be balanced in every aspect.....EVER. There are too many variables. <br />
<br />
Blizzard aka Tom Chilton has stated that their goal to balance pvp is based on 5v5. There are going to be more powerful/useful specs in different situations. Tanks are not going to be able to DPS thru a 2v2 match...duh. Is a holy preist going to heal their opponent to death? Wake the heck up and realize that if you want to be a feral druid, your gonna get kited to death...<br />
<br />
Please people wake the hell up and see the reality of WoW PvP. <br />

<br />
<br />
Lol another one of those &quot;I refuse to play because I got stomped for a few weeks when I had bad gear.&quot; Here's a hint, there's more than 1 bracket. Try 5v5, druids are underrepresented there.<br />
<br />
Just get PVE epics holy shit. It's season 1, the PVP gear is bad. PVE stuff is extremely competitive in Arena.<br />
<br />
Also, there are arena points in world pvp @ lake wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What about those of us with specs that are not generally accepted as Arena spec's? For instance, I'm a feral druid and have tried for weeks now to find a team that would take me so I could get some points. Despite the fact I have 380 res and can beat just about any class 1vs1, people &quot;think&quot; Ferals suck so I get denied for any half decent teams. For now I'm content with being able to get the best I can through honor and can at least stay competitive in BG's, but what to do when I can't earn AP for the new stuff because my spec makes people think I suck for arenas? Please don't tell me to spec Resto, I don't want to heal. <br />
<br />
What about Prot Pally's or Prot Warriors? Heck, even Enhancement Shamans (at least on live anyway). I truly hope Bliz makes these, and other, specs Arena viable in WoTLK, but even Bliz says some simply won't be viable. And yet they are forcing those specs to do Arena if they want PvP gear despite admitting they suck in Arena.<br />
<br />
My only hope now is that Lake Wintergrasp gives enough AP for participating that I can get my blue gear without having to do arenas. Still complete shit that I'll be stuck in blues for World PvP because I don't/can't do Arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a little thing in most major cities called a CLASS TRAINER. He UNLEARNS your TALENT POINTS for you so you can RESPEC. Fucking moron, go balance arenas so Prot pallies are viable yourself if you think you can.<br />
<br />
A PVE spec should NOT be competitive in arenas. Otherwise, how can a &quot;PVP spec&quot; be a PVP spec if it gets beaten by PVE specs? Why would anyone spec PVP in that case?<br />
<br />
And ZOMG NOT WEEKS. HOW COULD YOU NOT FIND A TEAM IN WEEKS OF TRADE CHAT SPAMMING?!?!?<br />
<br />
Have you even SEEN the new Wrath changes? Feral druids are getting plenty of stuff to be PVP viable. Don't you have any friends that PVP? Just arena with them. Or get a PVP guild and prove yourself.<br />
<br />
Also, try PVE epics. Why limit yourself to shitty blues? Get a PVE weapon and PVE epics to fill those 5 slots, and straight Honor gear for the rest. Bam, instant competitive gear.<br />

Based on this information alone I would say. I will not be buying WoTLK.<br />

3) Judging by this it will take roughly 25-50% longer to obtain each item provided you have the requirements. This will also mean you'll be unable to obtain roughly 25-50% of the gear if your currently stuck at a rating thats under 1900.<br />
<br />
4) It doesnt look like they have made any attempt at balancing classes and combo for the arena / bgs, and from their track record they never will.. So baring that in mind unless your unlucky with your class choice or you reroll 1-80 and then obtain all the above quickly you wont have much fun at all.<br />
<br />
5) I've still have not heard anything about prevents overgeared players steamrolling arenas<br />
<br />
6) Gun turrets, catapults, blowing up buildings? wtf? utter bollocks... it's nothing like what 85% of the PvPers out there have been asking for and imho it sounds hideously bad.<br />
<br />
7) Blizzard are still premoting the PvP-scrub / welfare slogans and boosting and team selling.<br />
<br />
8) WSG, AV, AB still remain old stagant and boring.<br />
<br />
9) They have made very little attempt to premote the horde / ally rivalry or to revent back to smaller battlegrounds groups where you might atleast have a slim chance of playing with and against the same players more then once.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Uh, what? Did you look at the AR points required, they aren't high at all.<br />
<br />
4) Wut? I can't get Brutal glad with 5 prot warriors? OMG I'M QUITTING. What? I get beat by another team that specced entirely for PVP with PVP oriented gear and a favorable PVP combination of classes? I SHOULD BE ABLE TO BEAT THEM WITHOUT EFFORT BLIZZARD, QQ.<br />
<br />
Imbalance isn't getting beaten by PVP characters, imbalance would be mouth breathers like yourself beating those PVPers with a PVE spec, retard spec, blue gear, and grouped with a prot pally and holy priest.<br />
<br />
6) And you OBVIOUSLY speak for &quot;85% of the PVPers out there.&quot; ::) Actually you're 100% wrong, most people want MORE WORLD PVP. It's the most common QQ of people who are tired of BGs and Arenas to make. Guess what, Lake Wintergrasp is an entire fucking ZONE for you to fight over. Have fun.<br />
<br />
(Oh, and all the people &quot;leaving wow for aoc/war&quot; also always say they're doing it because of &quot;better [world] pvp.&quot; So blizzard is proving that they can make siege battles too.)<br />
<br />
7) WTF does that even mean?<br />
<br />
8) Grats, so does MC, BWL, ZG, BRS, AQ, Kara, Gruul, Mag, SSC, TK, BT, Hyjal, ZA, Sunwell, and all the 5 mans. What makes scrub ass BG AFKers like you so much more deserving of a remake of old content?<br />
<br />
9) Uh, Lake Wintergrasp? And pre-cross realm BGs were awful, and you should be shot for wanting them back. I'm guessing you're one of those alliance players that outnumbered Horde 5:1 on their server and always won. Now you can't get your rocks off cause all the leet Horde PVPers with their imbalanced racials and 1700 PR required arena gear stomp your face in.<br />

To be fair, you can still get everything except the weapons and 5 set pieces in BGs. (Have to in fact.)<br />
<br />
I'm sure it won't kill people to get 6 pieces from PVE.<br />
<br />
And actually I'd argue the opposite about PVP specs vs. PVE specs. With everyone &quot;having to do arena&quot; you realize that you're much more likely to go against people like you, who are just doing it because they &quot;have to.&quot; Since you guys have been so adamant that they only reason you're not good at arenas is because of gear/spec/class differences, shouldn't you beat all those random people just doing arena to try to get their blue gear?<br />

This is a good thought, and yes there will probably be a greater number of people doing arenas just because they &quot;have to&quot; and will not have the ideal class make-up/spec/gear or whatever. Unfortunately, assuming these people make up 30%(just a guess) of the arena population, they will most likely lose as much as they win, thus still not getting a rating high enough for a lot of the gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For about 2 weeks. And you will get exploded by every warrior/DK/ret paladin/hunter/mage/ele shaman that gets within 15 yards of you. ESPECIALLY the mages. You roll around in front of them in PvE gear and you will be vaporized. The games will be so unfair that it won't even be thinking of being legitimate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GPTurismo</div><div class="date">2008-09-23, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the asinine rating requirements and forcing people to do both bg's &amp; arena they are really making pvp not enjoyable for 90% of the players. I do appreciate watching video's of the top pvp'ers, but the fact is they need to admit Arena wasn't completely thought out and really rethink the system instead of trying to tact on extra elements to it to &quot;balance it out&quot; and make it where people aren't getting &quot;welfare&quot; epics.<br />
<br />
But, if they alienate enough players which they already did with many people with s4, they will retool their system. Even with them trying to pander to the MLG/Pro Gamer crowds, they can't afford to loose many of their players who will leave for a game that has a more balanced pvp oriented system, say maybe Warhammer?<br />
<br />
If anything I hope Warhammer puts enough pressure on Blizzard to rethink the system. A little competition always helps.<br />
<br />
My hoping with the current system they are just trying to make sure tons of people don't get Purps that are higher quality than the first two 10 mans/first 25 man, and that they aren't going to maintain this trend with ratings and needing both honor &amp; arena points.<br />
<br />
With all of that said, I bet IGE &amp; other companies love the idea of being able to sell ratings &amp; arena points a lot. Guess I will have to deal with more sucky warriors, hunters &amp; druids in almost full sets of the current season in my bg lol.</div></div><hr />

There was blue gear with resilience when TBC came out that you got from honor and had the graphics of old Field Marshall / Warlord gear. And also, if you think the top Arena teams got high in the ladder without resilience or stam gear (not Karazhan epics) then you are smoking crack.<br />

<br />
currently you can get S2 welfare by pure honor but in WOTLK you'll be able to get a full set of savage gear by some BG's + simply hanging around the 1500-1600 mark in arena. will be extremely easy imo.<br />
<br />
Also, is it still valid you'll get arena pts from lake wintergrasp upon release or is that just a beta thing? If so, wow... im not hating savage welfare ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moron, you think I don't know that gear was there? And no, teams didn't get high arena ratings with that gear, IT SUCKED. REALLY BAD.<br />
<br />
Most people had very little resilience in season 1 before getting full glad. You used 2 piece HWL for the 35 resil bonus, filled out the other 3 slots with PVE gear, and grinding out your Glad points. No one got high without their honor offset pieces, but THOSE ARE STILL GOING TO BE THERE FOR HONOR IN WRATH SEASON 1. THE ONLY THING THAT WON'T BE THERE IS THE 5 PIECES OF SET GEAR AND A WEAPON. (The blue weapons sucked ass TBC, they probably suck just as much in Wrath.)<br />
<br />
My point is, this gear did nothing for getting arena ratings. The 2 piece set bonus was the only thing it was useful for. High rated teams had full glad, but that gear wasn't from honor. And you didn't GET high ratings with full HWL. You got high ratings with 2/5 Resil bonus, Honor off-set pieces, and strong epics in the other slots. (Also playing well, of course.)<br />
<br />
If you read my post, I said there were no GLADIATOR pieces for honor, not HWL/GM.<br />
<br />
Also, you don't need full fucking hateful glad gear to hit 1700 or whatever it takes for these pieces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. And that was perfectly viable too, I hit 70 during the middle of season 2 and started arena with the full blue Warlord set and the epic honor items. I was playing 2s as a resto shaman (not very viable) with a rogue friend in equal gear (not the best setup), versus teams in full s1 / s2 gladiator items.. we still exceeded 2000 rating with a lot of practice and a little skill, long before we had built up enough arena points for a full set of gladiator to match the gear of others. <br />
<br />
Granted, back in the original seasons it was easier.. the 'scrub' setups were not as well known back then, and the arena system as a whole was newer to people allowing for a more even playing field. <br />
<br />
This wont be the case in WOTLK, but since the first season is essentially a gear reset blue items will be competetive for the first several months, and if you are good enough you will progress through the epic items at the same rate as everyone else. If you dont progress when everyone else is equally geared and still get steamrolled, then to be honest you dont deserve the high end pvp gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shammers</div><div class="date">2008-09-25, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At all the QQers... <br />
You do know that Blizzard intended for you all to grind out the Savage gear first with no troubles, then with that gear get the Hateful Gladiator... Then with that gear get Deadly Gladiator? It's fairly simple really and anyone could figure out why? To keep you playing longer? <br />
<br />
This intended way to get appropriately geared makes complete sense... You progress through arena? What you people argue about the &quot;Deadly Gladiator Gear being HARD to get&quot; is pathetic really.. Do you all expect to be carried through t6 content in t4? It doesn't happen and its the same sort of thing. If you really all find this hard to do then go play a different game? The majority of the arena community definitely would find these gear requirements very fair. <br />
The fact that none of this gear requires BG marks is good.. TBH I didn't grind any merc gear in s4 and went straight from full s1/veterans (all acquired from pve) to 4/5 s4 with s3 shoulders -- simply because it was so hard to acquire bg marks as alliance on some battlegroups. <br />
I'm fairly confident that getting full Hateful Gladiator will be fairly easy 700AP is like what? 1 week? Plus wintergrasp yields AP no? and 6k HP is also terribly easy.. Since wsg/AB, etc yield 400honor per win.. <br />
Once at full Hateful Gladiator, I'm sure that getting past that level of arena wont be difficult.. And moving from Hateful Gladiator to Deadly Gladiator wont be difficult either..</div></div><hr />

I would like to think your being sarcastic, but the WoW player base makes me wonder...<br />
<br />
Other than the &quot;purple gear = I am cool&quot; factor why do people even grind honor for it? the majority admit to not liking pvp, its just easy gear.. they apparantly are not good enough at pve to get epics the usual way so what are they going to do with this set? run fail kara pugs in pvp gear repeatedly?<br />
<br />
I dont get the appeal of honor epics for people who don't play wow for its pvp content, but there sure are lots of them stinking up every battleground these days</div></div><hr />

The problem some people have is social. They do not, or cannot, join guilds or arena teams. BGs let them solo to epics.<br />
<br />
As for what they do... they use gear to get more gear, like everyone else does. This journey is its own reward.</div></div><hr />
