I was pretty certain that Blizzard said they'd be removing all talents that buff buffs. <br />
<br />
I did notice that apparently Static Shock no longer removes Lightning Shield orbs when it procs, which means the majority of fights will never require a reapplication of Lightning Shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difficulty and complexity of the enhance shaman to maximise DPS now involves watching maelstrom weapon as a buff and searing flames as a debuff, alongside a tight CD priority list and no wiggle room for disaster. <br />
<br />
Continuing to play my Retribution Paladin now. Thanks Blizzard</div></div><hr />

<br />
This talent isn't new or interesting. And its 35% BASE mana, not total mana (so it's something like 1000 mana at level 80 or something). You don't pick up this talent at later levels of gear because you have Shamanistic Rage to replenish your mana pool when you OOM</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this mean were getting a healing shock spell?<br />

<br />
In the first lot of class previews there was no mention of a new shock spell. So I'm thinking that if you want to activate this talent you'll be having a macro:<br />

For me it suits rather Elemental spec. Many Ele shamans I know are using Searing Totem and Enh shamans are using Fire Nova Totem.<br />

Some1 already mentioned it. We still see a lot of passive buffs in talents. TBH I can't see any changes in Elemental tree beside lack of ToW and adding Earthquake. Am I the only one who is disappointed as hell ?</div></div><hr />

My very early version of the ENH tree - no icons, and I couldn't get LL and Improved DW to both link to Dual Wield so I just had it link to IDW and will just have to let it slide until then.

<br />
The difficulty and complexity of the enhance shaman to maximise DPS now involves watching maelstrom weapon as a buff and searing flames as a debuff, alongside a tight CD priority list and no wiggle room for disaster. <br />
<br />
Continuing to play my Retribution Paladin now. Thanks Blizzard<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it will be interesting now that you have to actually pay attention to a few more things rather than just blindly following a priority list. We'll probably have to ensure a 5/5 stack of Searing Flames before using Lava Lash and try and use it before the next Searing Totem's attack refreshes it back to 5, which won't really be that useful. <br />
<br />
Shamans do have quite a bit to do even now, but one thing that will make life easier is there will be less fire totem refreshing... the GCDs were usually very tight when Magma Totem was involved, but now we get a little more wiggle room. With a higher CD for Lava Lash, we should yet again get more wiggle room. Also, now Static Shock does not remove orbs, which means we get even more wiggle room.</div></div><hr />

Very. I don't see the &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;less cluttered&quot; or any of the other buzzwords that they promised for Enhance. I only see three new talents - one that makes it so we're dropping Searing instead of Magma (oh goodie, now I'll feel bad when working on AoE pulls, and I'll have to apologize more when my totem pulls another pack we didn't want!) and one that makes it so people ca'nt just wand our totems (oh horror, have to go touch it with your gray weapon to make it die?) and the speed one (I guess it's nice, if you ignore Death Knights get it trained, and can turn it on and off, and has no point cost...)</div></div><hr />

if you take earthquake as an ele dps shaman ur wasting a point...<br />
<br />
and a lot has changed <br />
-elemental mastery effecting LvB <br />
-lava surge (flame shock ticks refresh CD on LvB)<br />
<br />
those are just 2 off the top of my head and those are pretty ground breaking changes i'd say it'd up dps by atleast 2-3k than current elemental dps is atm<br />
<br />
also btw does enhancing totems mean its going to effect totem of wrath? <br />
<br />
edit: <br />
build if enhancing totems effects totem of wrath <br />
http://cata.wowhead.com/talent#hyh0qcdIedf0AuVcfk0h<br />
if not i'll just switch it to shields<br />
anyone come up w/ something else?<br />
<br />
also think that they should take earthquake and give it to everyone, its not really needed by anyone as a dps increase its just something nice for trash, i just dont see myself wanting to spend a point to get something thats for trash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, in my tired stupor, I completely ignored what I was actually writing... we do blindly follow a priority list and so do pretty much all classes. The biggest difference is that Shamans have a relatively long priority list and they aren't always terribly simple... a single line in the priority list can have one or more conditions attached to it. What I meant to infer was that we will most likely have even more conditions attached to our priorities. For example, instead of Lava Lash, it might end up being Lava Lash + SF5 or Lava Lash + SF5 + UW-F (UW-F being the buff from having Flametongue on while using Unleashed Weapon). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I understand how complicated it can be compared to others classes... I play them all. Most classes either have a short priority list or don't have a terrible amount of conditions attached. There are of course some slight changes you can make to eke a bit more DPS out of most classes that aren't as simple. But anyway, I usually watch around 9-ish cooldowns (6 or so being main abilities), Maelstrom Weapon, Lightning Shield, Maelstrom Power (best to use your Fire Elemental with this active since the FE takes an active screenshot of your attributes), totems and the HWT buff. Then I also track Stormstrike and Flame Shock on all enemies. <br />
<br />
Yes, it ends up being a lot, but I don't honestly mind most of it.</div></div><hr />

What is all this whine I see about having a tight rotation? I got in the top 20 on (enh) dps yesterday on Marrowgar25hc, and I barely looked at any timers or bars. I even opened my chat at times... If you people really have problems with the ways of the enhancement shaman you should really just play your spec more, just keep doing your thing on the dummies till you have it in your fingers...<br />
<br />
I find these new talents totally bullshit. We barely don't have anything new at all! The searing totem thingy is also really disappointing because all it does is buffing a totem, forcing us to move away from magma totem. I really don't like that change. They could at least have gone and buffed the searing totem so that it actually did more dps to a single target (no news on new skills yet tho, so it might come) then magma totem does without talents. And with this change to searing totem I pray to god that they have made it possible for us to decide which target the searing totem attacks. If we would do like we do today and redropping the totem over and over until it hits the target you want it to then.......<br />
<br />
I am worried when I look at these talents. None of them are talking about any kind of new skill that we might get (intentionally I guess(hope)), and all the new things that we got are things that other classes got already, which is balancing it all up I guess. But there are still no fixes for our bad damage, and now we even get LESS aoe damage... (no magma). Honestly, I don't get what Blizzard are doing if these are the final talents for my spec. <br />
<br />
What really irritates me about these talents are the fact that I will be sitting there with a LOT of free time that I can use to chat with people, or some other bullshit. <br />
Not having to refresh Lightning Shield? It's a nice change that should have been there from the start! <br />
No magma totem spam? Should have been there long ago, but this new talent will make it so that you can't really aoe and single target at the same time, isn't that kinda, uhm... bad? + you get more freetime that you used for the magma totem spamming.<br />
Having to wait for 5 stacks of Searing Flames on the target before you can use Lava Lash? Why, god, why. Why are we getting all this free time that we already had enough of?<br />
<br />
I really hope Blizzard is giving us all this free time because they have a new fancy skill they want us to use, so they make room for it. If not, the spec will be just even more faceroll then it is today &gt;_&lt; (They even promised us something that would force us to choose an ability over another so that it would be way easier to be good, or bad when it comes to how much damage you do...)<br />
<br />
I really hope that Blizzard just says that these are the somewhat final talents at the moment because these were the talents that leaked earlier in the alpha, just to chill down the people, or something... and that they have something better stored for later.<br />
<br />
anyway, this is the talent spec that I see as BiS so far for Cataclysm: http://cata.wowhead.com/talent#hVhNVbZxIcoVueoucouct</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless I missed something, the only buff was the Searing Flames talent. The thing is, Searing Flames will really just end up being a mechanic that provides light DPS and is used to buff Lava Lash. If you have the first Searing Totem blast hit right after Lava Lash goes off, you have to consider that your initial hit will only execute through about 2/3 of it's DoT duration. Everything after that point will go through even less before it is removed by the next Lava Lash. This could change of course... I think we'd need to poke and prod the numbers a bit to see what works the best.<br />
<br />
Essentially what I'm saying is that Searing Totem itself really isn't being buffed in what we'll see in our damage output. Sure, Searing Flames will do some bonus damage, but I wouldn't consider it game-changing. What we'll be using it for is the bonus damage to Lava Lash.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
- You get almost 2 minutes each fight without Magma Totem spam from your FE, we are fairly used to this already.<br />
- Lava Lash has a 10 second cooldown. Searing Flames can stack up to 5 times. Searing Totem attacks every 2 seconds. So, in about 10-11 seconds, we should have 5 stacks (consider that it is an actual fire ball that is fired, so it has travel time). In other words, we won't really be waiting on this!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, my point was that this talent makes Searing Totem better then Magma Totem since it buffs Lava Lash, and Magma Totem don't. I should have said buffing Searing Totems priority or something to make my post less confusing. But really, the talent does force us to use Searing instead of Magma, aka a buff to the totem, and the damage from the dot makes the totem do more damage in a way.<br />
<br />
I still wonder tho, does the Searing Flames stacks, stack? Like, does the numbers get bigger the higher the stacks? Ignite ish? Would be kinda cool. (but I guess not since the 5th stack would never be able to do a single tick of damage.)<br />
I still think Blizzard is kinda fucking up here, it would be WAY better to have the damage of the DOT stack, and make Lava Lash NOT consume the charges, or consume the lowest hitting of the DOT stacks, or something.<br />
<br />
When I talked about free time, I were only talking about 1sec here and 1 sec there, not huge breaks. And as it looks now we will have to wait like 1 second before we can use Lava Lash, which is a lot of time if you ask me :o at least when you look at how enhancement is now compared to other specs today, added the free time coming with cata. imo.</div></div><hr />

What I'm scratching my head over is where in the world the 3% crit debuff from totem of wrath went. I see that fire totems now increase SP by 10% but did blizzard take the crit debuff away from us? Was this mentioned before in a blue post or just something they might have forgotten to add in the talent preview?</div></div><hr />

Unrelenting storm and Elemental Mastery are early enough in the Elemental tree that restro shamans can pick it up and get a ridiculous mana regen buff (12% of int as mp5), combined with Convection for reduced shock cost, which makes Focused insight more appealing, Elemental Focus for a significantly cheaper heal when the shock does crit, 4/5 reverberation for shocks more often, the 100% crit damage boost talent, and 6% less damage taken as icing. You only need to sacrifice 2 restro talent points, 15% max mana, a small of extra mana regen from water shield, a bit of extra earth shield healing, a fixed amount of spellpower, and possibly a movement buff (assuming you spec into enh that far).</div></div><hr />

I think they are still discussing it. It would be very nice for 100% Elemental Devastation damage. Im not sure if it would boost our dmg a lot and it is also one more button to check/push.</div></div><hr />

Just an idea someone put together as concept, yet i find way more compelling than these changes, which for us are rather few compared to what we saw 2 months ago. When i saw them then, i considered them early build talents. Now they are considered the most complete? Really? I'm just not feeling the big draw. It's kinda nice, bt something like the Imp feral spirit, shown in that link, would be way more compelling. In fact so many talents in there just seem much more fun and inline with what blizz told us than what they have shown us today.<br />
Pls blizz, get on it.</div></div><hr />

I think elemental get the crit added to whatever fire totem they have out, might be part of the mastery for ele.</div></div><hr />

Totemic Vigor (bonus health for totems) in Enhancement<br />
Shitloads of boring talents<br />

I refuse to believe that this is the final look... Please. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and yet, they plan to make onehanders viable to Fury, so Warriors dont feel they &quot;need&quot; to go TG route... yea, you can see where their priorities are<br />
<br />
so, after good night of sleep, i still find these pretty underwhelming, from ele PoV, i dont even friccking know where to spend tons of points, since the main grabber in enha (5% crit) is gone and FT buff is on third tier, basically wasting 10 points to get it, unless raids are outdoors and we can use GW AND mana will be so huge issue we would need the 15% more mana... yea, i dont see that happening. I have 14 points to waste, even after picking up every single elemental pve talent. oh well, probably take 3 points out of convection for elemental warding and totally waste 10 points in enha to get minimal SP buff for FT and reduced shock cost.<br />
<br />
Lets hope for more new talents? :p</div></div><hr />

I mean the beta isn't out yet, im 100% sure every shaman on the beta now if theyre not elemental is wanting to see more changes. <br />
<br />
However, the new enhancement things look way more interesting. specially as im pretty sure Glyph of Lava Lash will change to do something like 'Lava Lash will not consume searing flames when used.' Plus, it means there's not as much totem wiggling and management, making us have a little bit of room for error, unlike now.<br />
<br />
Also im pretty sure that Searing Flames and the Searing totem is being made to do more damage on single targets than magma. <br />
<br />
Come on Blizz, throw us a bone, don't let enhancement get overlooked time and time again... (ghostwolf says hi)</div></div><hr />

Spirit Link was removed in WotLK beta, it could just as easily be added in Cata Beta.<br />
<br />
It's been mentioned that Flametongue Totem was going to be replaced by a baseline version of Totem of Wrath. Yet the Enhancing Totems talent improves the effectiveness of Flametongue.<br />
<br />
Something needs to be added to allow Earthquake to scale with caster gear.<br />
<br />
Wrathful totems is still a place holder.<br />
<br />
In Beta there will be plenty of changes, there always is.</div></div><hr />

well I suppose some of us arent quite ready to trust Blizzard to NOT mess with shaman class again. I still remember how great it was in wotlk beta, when TS had bigger arc and was actually useful and when both LB and LvB got gigh +%SP coefficients from talent, which was lately nerfed &quot;overpowered&quot; and look! the talent right now is back to beta % numbers, because shaman dps sucked since Ulduar till 3.3.2-3 and was, after all, well balanced in the first place.<br />
<br />
Out of all two new talents, the LvB CD refresher one is pretty meh due to its randomness. Personally, I would have preffered something more in line of &quot;Your Flame Shock damage over time has a 10/20/30% chance to make your next Lava Burst shorten its next CD by 2 seconds. stacks three(maybe two for pvp purposes of purposedly waiting till max stacks for big bad burst?) times. (numbers can be tweaked anyway, maybe even 15/30/45% chance on 1.5s CD reduction, 3-4 stacks? or even 20/40/60% chance on 1s CD reduction? less RNG?)<br />
<br />
basically I see something like; we cast LvB, in the meantime, FlS will tick, lets say, 4 times, before we finish cast of next LvB, lets say two of these will proc the 2s reduction. Therefor after we cast the second LvB, the CD of next one wont be 8, but 4 seconds. Now, in those 4 seconds, we have only two ticks of FlS, lets say one procs, after we cast next LvB, the CD for next one will be 6 seconds. Now we have three ticks, which can proc. etc etc<br />
<br />
Why I, personally, think this is way better is because it still makes our rotation unpredictable and dynamic, yet there wont be &quot;wasted procs&quot; AND it potentially can be more manageable in environment, since it gives us at worst two to three seconds to plan next move and how will this proc(s) affect our rotation, instead of instant change of LvB CD, which even in best case scenarios will loose lot of its potential by proccing in bad moments.</div></div><hr />

Elemental and Resto shamans can both get all of their needed talents in their own trees and still spec down to dual wield. 800+ SP and also the oppurtunity to dual wield Black Magic or the new cata best enchant. Just saying that the trees would definitely have to be rearranged to avoid this happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All caster 1h weapons are Main-hand only, and as far as the double enchant aspect applies, whatever weapon you used in your offhand to get the extra enchant would probably not make up for the loss of stats of a caster offhand</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean, like second Flametongue + caster enchant wont be far better than whatever spellpower, or more likely only intelect, since SP is supposedly going to remain on weapons only? even nowadays, thats like, umm, 336 SP (+-?) vs 127 SP and 103 int(with best shield in game? meaning more powerful on lower levels of gear?), guess what, i dont give a crap about 1,5% crit and 1500 mana, 200 SP is way better. So based on current situation, DW is better and unless they massively buff offhands item budget and nerf Flametongue (like, two FTs not stacking, boo!), I dont see how DW wouldnt be better, even with some melee dps weapon with 2 of crit/hit/haste.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kouki</div><div class="date">2010-06-12, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive got a Question about the Focused insight talent.<br />
<br />
So the effect:<br />
<br />
After casting any shock spell, your next heal's mana cost is reduced by 15/30/45/60/75% of the cost of the shock spell, and its healing effectiveness is increased by 5/10/15/20/25%.<br />
<br />
My Question: <br />
<br />
Will talents that reduce the mana cost of shock spells, interfere with this talent?</div></div><hr />
