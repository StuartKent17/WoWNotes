Activision Blizzard Investor Call<br />
The latest earnings call had a few interesting points! <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard had the biggest quarterly online player community in its history with a record 46 million MAUs, up 38% year-over-year. MAUs have doubled since early 2015. <br />
Blizzard had all-time record DAUs<br />
The Overwatch community continued to grow more than a year after launch, setting another all-time MAUB record with the release of two seasonal events in the quarter<br />
Hearthstone MAUs grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to an all-time record, driven by its expansion, Journey to Un'Goro<br />
World of Warcraft time spent grew year over year, and Legion continues to outperform the prior expansion.<br />
Blizzard plans to release another large content drop this quarter, with more details at Gamescom.<br />
There are multiple dedicated incubation teams working on new games, experiences, or IPs being lead by some of the most experienced game designers at Blizzard. The company is thinking about different platforms, especially mobile. <br />

PvE<br />
If the internal raid team has spent hours on testing KJ, why did take you so long to apply necessary adjustments to the boss? <br />
Seeing a top guild wipe repeatedly and get nowhere on an encounter for a day or two is not uncommon (e.g. Dark Animus, Blackhand). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/893468425661464580))<br />
There's a narrow line between &quot;this is VERY hard&quot; and &quot;this is TOO hard&quot;; it took time because we weren't yet sure they were necessary. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/893468232505479169))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Still not explained how Sargeras went about acquiring the titan souls. Retcon from Chronicles?<br />
Eonar kind of explains this, in the time since the Chronicle he's managed to gather them all, except her, and has already turned Aggramar. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/892957199734939649))<br />
I know only so much can be expressed in game, I just wish it was explained better. Question is more how sargeras got souls from keepers.<br />
I don't want to get too deep into it, but Sargeras has has quite a while to work on his plan. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/892959064795127808))<br />
<br />
Do the human turned worgen become immortal, or live at all longer than they wouldve normally?<br />
I don't think anything in lore indicates that they live longer, but I might be wrong. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/894603828372185090))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
How friendly should developers get with community sites/leaders? I feel like if they are too friendly it gives a bad impression and feels cliqueish where their concerns are addressed more often than random players.<br />
I would say very friendly. Those community sites are providing an enormous service for both you and players.<br />
<br />
I agree there is a risk of you appearing to make game changes just because they request them. On the other hand, maybe they advocate those changes because they are representing the views of a lot of players who visit their site.<br />
<br />
I’ve been in situations where we kept community creators and leaders at arm’s length, but I don’t think that stance makes sense. Consider this: gaming news sites want news because that drives visits to their site. They are going to provide news whether or not you as the developer are involved. But if you can give them something to talk about (and it doesn’t just have to be a content exclusive), then they are getting what they need out of the relationship, but you’re getting something as well.<br />
<br />
I feel quite indebted to all of the folks who ran Age of Empires, World of Warcraft, or League of Legends sites over the years. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/161004393623/how-friendly-should-developers-get-with-community))<br />

Doesn't matter shit. People are playing the game whether they &quot;enjoy&quot; it or not. If people didn't enjoy it at all they wouldn't be paying a subscription right?<br />

Heh, that made me chuckle, because it's true, just in another way. In german we have the &quot;dümmster anzunehmender user&quot;, like dumbest assumable user in english (is this an acutal acronym in english or known?!). Anyway, it's just so true it hurts :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This quarter means July, August and September, So it most likely (most def) 7.3 and the Argus zones. Should probably release around end of August/start of Sptember. Just as with Broken Shore, releasing new zone a few months before new raid tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually find this pretty interesting. I was expecting 7.3 to be the last major patch. It feels through rumor and foot stomping that xpac 7 will be at blizzcon. And they have more or less said 7.3 is feature complete. 7.3.5 could be what they are talking about. But I didn't think 7.4 was possible. but based on time tables, if they make a 7.4, it could lead right up to 8.0 without a massive content drought. I already expected that time to be smaller with the patch release of Legion which imo has been a big improvement. <br />
<br />
At any rate I will focus a bit more at gamescon than I thought I would.<br />
<br />
*Edit: unless that was just reiterating 7.3. But still.</div></div><hr />

~Former Vanilla Players<br />
<br />
When the games key metric is changed from subscriptions -&gt; money -&gt; &quot;time spent in game&quot;... this is WoW's OKR now. How much time players spend in the game, hence all the time gating, grinding and other fun activities of a f2p game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As in players are spending more time playing (despite being fewer in number).<br />
<br />
Or the hours added up of every player in game? (Because there are more players, thus bumping up the amount of hours spent) year over year makes it sound like it's increasing every year so I doubt this is the metric they're using considering the drops the last few expansions.<br />
<br />
If it's the former then that's probably because of the grind.<br />
<br />
I doubt it's the latter.</div></div><hr />

Average session length (and the number of sessions in a day, week, month, etc), while doing stuff obviously. AFK is not counted.</div></div><hr />

There are two statements there, and easy to read it wrong. What they mean is what you wrote, people spend more time on the game(competing with Warlords of Garrisons, doooh) BUT it also outperforms it, wich is more on the economic side of it.</div></div><hr />

No, you are reading into it. It's about the time spent metric. It doesn't mention any money at all because it would be silly.to compare two different metrics.</div></div><hr />

There's only one line:<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft time spent grew year over year, and Legion continues to outperform the prior expansion.&quot;<br />
It doesn't specify a different metric and even if it was a different metric - you don't know which. But I remember WoD being and expansion with nothing to do.<br />
<br />
But ok, let's say for the sake of argument, they are talking about money here. Fine. They outperform WoD, the worst expansion money wise. Good job, Blizzard. I guess WoW tokens and character boosts (to skip the fucking grinding) sell well.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I have to add, it doesn't have to be only earnings, sure(but it surely is included in that last line)It can mean more subs, that they earn more from shop etc, and also time spent. As you say, its only one line. Like the rest of the statement. It is one sentence sure, but actually two lines. They have one sentence for each game in that short statement. If they were to describe every part of the game, it wouldn't be a short statement. <br />
<br />
They use the word outperform it, wich I believe(who knows really right) means that Legion outperforms WoD in every way. Wich is fairly reasonable. I also had a little nod to that Legion outperforms WoD, wich shouldn't be really hard :D</div></div><hr />

So you have an issue with grinding. Surely you prefer having all the loot delivered to your mailbox while afking mid-air and still you will complain about &quot;having nothing to do&quot; on the forums.

<br />
I enjoyed Legion, it is now on a pause though. Still better than WoD, alas I enjoyed the WoD community way more.

If the grind is boring, people won't play anyway. I don't even play the game anymore, not because it's boring because it surely isn't and not even close, but because my class(Warlock) is the most boring it has ever been by a long shot.</div></div><hr />

Legion's success attracted the worst people too, never had such toxic experiences in WoD at least. There are problems with Legion, way too much dungeon forcing to progress and the list goes on. Still, the content is nicer now.<br />
<br />
i wished that they had the &quot;pay as you play&quot; model long ago. I log in only average 3 days a week. 2 days to raid, and a day to maybe do other stuff. This will probably never happen. Heck, even a simple music app like Spotify goes by per month. Or even if they do implement it, they will likely make it twice as costly to us if we choose this payment method.<br />
<br />
For comparison, paying for WoW is equivalent to 1/3 or almost 1/2 my mobile bill; in terms of my country's currency. <br />
<br />
In any case Legion kept me playing since its launch; grind or not. Which is more than what I can say for WoD (quit after the 1st month).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, like raiding, which still provides artifact power to make-up for the grinding you don't like and still put in effort and team play to down difficult bosses. What's the issue if you still gain the currency you mostly need in this expansion?. Even PvP and Dungeons, which people did before the existence of artifact power, provide that currency in addition to loot. I don't see what the issue is now. Oh, because you feel forced to do something every time you log in and would rather log in and afk mid-air without missing on anything?. Wasn't Vanilla all about hardcore grinding?.</div></div><hr />

That's what I'm doing actually. I'm happy that Blizzard decided to slow down the AP grinding.<br />

It was an issue back then, not now. It was almost required if you wanted to do mythic raids.<br />

We're no longer in vanilla times but the majority prefer the vanilla play style, which was a rewarding play style for those that logged in often. This also explains why this expansion is rather active and lively compared to others. The way the game is at the moment is the best it could ever be. I could log-in any day of the week and still I'll have an explosion of things to do. That's how the game is supposed to be. Those that prefer doing one objective at a time then proceed to afk mid-air should find another game.</div></div><hr />

Good thing I never said that WoW has no negatives then isn't it? If you look around some of my posts in WoW I've stated things that I don't like about the game. Now if I was in denial about some of the flaws of a game that would be bordering on blind fanaticism. Which I don't do.<br />

<br />
Well no fucking shit! The expansion literally has a &quot;carrot on a stick&quot; approach in everything, hiding everything behind RNG... even reputation mounts for God's sake. People are now compelled to play a lot more, with no end goal but chance.<br />
<br />
Fuck that, and fuck Blizzard... this is only going to encourage them to go further with this method.<br />
<br />
What's next? Lower the amount of guaranteed loot amount in raids to 1, leaving additional ones up to chance? Make mount drops proc for varying speeds? Splatter on more layers of procs on gear drops?<br />
<br />
Legion will forever be the &quot;Burn Out&quot; expansion to me... never before had I felt the need to stop playing, taking a 3 month break.<br />
<br />
But go on Blizz, try to chase off more players with this retarded approach. Should do wonders if it carries over into future expansions.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but as I recall they said something like it is &quot;slightly outperfroming&quot; last time they compared the two. These reports are to please shareholders so they word them carefully. I don't know how much of an award I would give them for beating WoD anyhow. I would be more interested in seeing the coralation between /played and /spent on tokens/subs/shop items tbh if I were a shareholder.

Not quite. Their answer was (some weeks ago) that they know that their internal raid team isn't as good as top tier raiders. So they extrapolate from the internal raid team to make an appropriate difficult level for world first hunters. But their own raid team got better more than they thought, so they overestimated how much Method &amp; Co are able to deal with.</div></div><hr />

I was expecting 7.3 to be the last major patch. It feels through rumor and foot stomping that xpac 7 will be at blizzcon. And they have more or less said 7.3 is feature complete. 7.3.5 could be what they are talking about. But I didn't think 7.4 was possible. but based on time tables, if they make a 7.4, it could lead right up to 8.0 without a massive content drought. I already expected that time to be smaller with the patch release of Legion which imo has been a big improvement. <br />
<br />
At any rate I will focus a bit more at gamescon than I thought I would.<br />
<br />
*Edit: unless that was just reiterating 7.3. But still.<br />
<br />
From playing PTR, I can tell you that Argus feels massive compared to broken shore (not exactly challenging, but). That alone is a lot of new world content. Plus the raid and any other features added...</div></div><hr />

Yes, the majority of players do want that. How many active players did Nostralis have again?.<br />
<br />
We all work, that's how we make a living and find time/room for entertainment like WoW. If the game catered players like you, who would rather log-in fully ready to raid for 2 hours and take off, then the game would be dead long ago. It's an MMO-RPG, it's supposed to have grinding aspects as well as many other various activities. Why is there an open world and new content?, to fly around aimlessly and observe the sunlight?. You simply don't like that and prefer basic gameplay where you log-in ready to do one part of the game and then take off. WoD and Cataclysm are two expansions that fully catered your flavor and they failed miserably for doing so. Legion on the other hand is doing the opposite and is a massive success. I don't even play the game anymore because my class(Warlock) is boring and garbage but I sure as hell hope they don't cater the needs of players like you next expansion and kill the game again. When I log in, I like to log in knowing that I have various fun and rewarding activities to do in addition to raiding.<br />
<br />
That said, I have to say that the WoW community is one of the weirdest communities I've ever come across playing the game for over a decade now. When Blizzard provides activities and content, the players cry and complain. When they don't, they still cry and complain that the activities aren't good enough for them...</div></div><hr />

That press release was not released for you, the player. It was crafted to tell the best story of the business for their investors. This needs to be said every time there's a quarterly report - they don't care about your experience playing the game, they don't care what you want to hear, this is for the investors, who only want to hear that the company is healthy, and their money safe. They compared it to WOD because it told a story that looks good to investors - the game is thriving, not dying.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
What metric are they using to calculate time spent in game?<br />
<br />
As in players are spending more time playing (despite being fewer in number).<br />
<br />
Or the hours added up of every player in game? (Because there are more players, thus bumping up the amount of hours spent) year over year makes it sound like it's increasing every year so I doubt this is the metric they're using considering the drops the last few expansions.<br />
<br />
If it's the former then that's probably because of the grind.<br />
<br />
I doubt it's the latter.<br />
<br />
The numbers are for all their games. Hearthstone and Overwatch most likely make up the bulk of it.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to grind to be competitive. You need to grind to meet top-tier mythic raiding guilds' expectations, but that is the high end of gaming in WoW which basically isn't even gaming anymore; it is a marathon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all work, that's how we make a living and find time/room for entertainment like WoW. If the game catered players like you, who would rather log-in fully ready to raid for 2 hours and take off, then the game would be dead long ago. It's an MMO-RPG, it's supposed to have grinding aspects as well as many other various activities. Why is there an open world and new content?, to fly around aimlessly and observe the sunlight?. You simply don't like that and prefer basic gameplay where you log-in ready to do one part of the game and then take off. WoD and Cataclysm are two expansions that fully catered your flavor and they failed miserably for doing so. Legion on the other hand is doing the opposite and is a massive success. I don't even play the game anymore because my class(Warlock) is boring and garbage but I sure as hell hope they don't cater the needs of players like you next expansion and kill the game again. When I log in, I like to log in knowing that I have various fun and rewarding activities to do in addition to raiding.<br />
<br />
That said, I have to say that the WoW community is one of the weirdest communities I've ever come across playing the game for over a decade now. When Blizzard provides activities and content, the players cry and complain. When they don't, they still cry and complain that the activities aren't good enough for them...<br />
<br />
<br />
lol and what was the rewarding part of Vanilla wow????? if you where on any guild that did the current raid you stuck on doing the last raid that was release. <br />
And god forsake those ugly 40m raid where you need to deal with 10 idiots that didnt know mechanics or 5 ppl that go AFK for no reason. <br />
<br />
yeah Vanilla rocks -.-<br />
<br />
Plus i dont care about logging and be rdy for raid. i have 0 issues with the current model of AP grind since is easy to do it logging 2hs each day and doing WQ and 2 or 3 M+ making sure you just do a plus 15 at the end of the week to get Max ap from it and good gear. <br />

<br />
Are you being willfully ignorant? There are many factors as to why Vanilla private servers have less population than an officially supported one would potentially have:<br />
- People are hesitant to invest hundreds (or thousands) of hours on a server that can be shut down with no notice.<br />
- The entire population is forced onto a small number of servers, meaning the more popular a private server becomes the less stable and enjoyable it becomes. This is exacerbated when multiple regions are forced together. (A prime example being Nost with Chinese vs Western players friction.)<br />
- Some features, skills or encounters are re-implemented based on guesswork and sometimes don't work correctly. Typically this effort is duplicated over and over as each private server competes to be more accurate (or have other features) so they don't want to share their codebase.<br />
- You need to download an old version of the game from a torrent or third party site. Many people aren't comfortable doing that.<br />
- Lack of dedicated support and accountability by those that run the server.<br />
- Servers that develop a clique around the admins or offer gear in return for donations are a big turn off.</div></div><hr />

Perfect so we confirmed that 800k or 150k are bullshit.</div></div><hr />

800k at total, 150k active (logged at least once) for last month of Nost. But yes, there were players all over the world, of course they didn't play concurrently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legion was announced at gamescon<br />
blizzard has been excited for this gamescon<br />
and even said it would be the best one they have ever done.<br />
and with legion having been announced, at one, they would need to do something even bigger<br />

Just like Legion doesn't have 5M (or whatever the number is) players online all the time.<br />

I agree that WoD was bad but literrally it was like playing a phone app. But dont come and tell me Vanilla was good when it wasnt by far.<br />
<br />
Well.. some players just want MMO and RPG game. Which current game is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You fail to understand HOW ACTIVE ACCOUNT are checked.<br />
<br />
On nostl/elysium there are max 15k account active after the launch. NOT the 800k or 150k bs that people continue to throw like a tantrum, account created =\= account ACTIVE and even if there were 100k active account the first weeks it doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
They can cherry pick what they want to make more people or Chinese bot to create account but they don't have obbligation like blizzard to his investor to give real precise data. <br />
<br />
No 150k no 800k, end of story.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
We don't have data so it is better to not give any absolute statement.</div></div><hr />

you wrong, it was a success for the moment. That doesn't mean it was great and the new things are bad, that you dont like it totally different. In the state of the game right now you can still RP if that someone if interested. <br />
<br />
My way to think is, that they do the changes bc they do resarch and they find out is a improvement for the game, they can miss they are humans. But if the game didnt change and stay the way it was at Vanilla the game will die.<br />
<br />
You can said what ever you want about the Vanilla server, but 1 is free to play, 2 the game that is 12 year old still have success, if not they will shut it down like other MMO that have die over the years that WoW have live and 3 yeah they aim to a new player base with each expansion bc is a business and they need to keep it generating money.<br />
<br />
if you dont like or you can adapt (like most player) just quite and stop QQ. Is that simple.<br />

sorry but no. The game still is a MMO and still is a RPG game. I dont know where you getting isnt??.<br />
<br />
Maybe i dont get what you want from a MMO but right now, if i compare WoW with any other MMO out there it have the same formula. And as a RP game you can still do that on the game. Or i dont know what you want.</div></div><hr />
