Azsharan Medallion Quest<br />
The Xal'atath quest line won't appear for a while. <br />
So now that 8.1.5 is live I went straight to the first Naga invasion and killed like a million of em and no medallion (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165668-azsharan-medallion), is the quest live? Anyone know the drop rate? Even Wowhead doesn’t have much to say on this. Anyone?!!! I really want the Xal Atath chain to unlock my gift of N’Zoth<br />
Confirmed – the beginnings of this questline will start appearing closer to the opening of the Crucible of Storms raid in April.</div></div><hr />

So, what, they can be taking all sorts of damage and they just heal through it? Very balanced, such fair, wow.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Apparently they meant the Monk ability. That's fine. :p</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure this is only for BrM Monks and wasn’t intended to be from the self dot from how their Stagger works.<br />
The way Stagger works, it will end up killing the BrM before Regen heals them up from it fast enough and even then Regen will end before Stagger runs out. BrM is still better actually clearing the damage with Brews rather than trying to use Regen outside of combat or in combat without taking outside damage.</div></div><hr />

Aaahh, I see. Okay, that makes much more sense. Yeah, I don't see a problem with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stagger cannot kill the Monk. It is to give them some use out of it though since Stagger lasts I believe 8 seconds (talented?) so any time they took damage it would interrupt Regeneratin' for the next 8 seconds which would be nearly up to the minimum of a taunt swap. So much damage going around that a Zandalari won't generally even get much out of the heal, a BrM would never get use out of it in any content other than in between pulls.</div></div><hr />
