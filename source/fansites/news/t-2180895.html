It was expected that Blizzard would do it, but I wonder if this did not occur in the PTR. It is simply IMPOSSIBLE to turn quest and imagine stopping to choose which items to buy in the NPC with so much striking in the area.<br />
<br />
In the Cataclysm Timewalking they fix the NPCs in their capitals, of course, because it was the expansion hub, same thing with the WoTLK (Dalaran) and TBC (Shattrath) Timewalks, so who was the retarded who had the idea to fix MoP NPC on the fucking Timeless Isle?! I was automatic OMW to Sanctuary in the Valley imagining that it would be the most plausible place to find the NPC, when I look at the map, it is there on Timeless Isle, when I reach there died so much with more than 20 hordes killing ally. Its not fun.<br />
<br />
Now I ask again. Blizz didnt tested that on PTR? They didnt saw that It was going shit? Sincerely, I hope Blizz change the NPC from Timeless Isle because the way it is i dont even want to do the event ...<br />
<br />
I'm tired of dying on the island. Not fair, not fun.<br />

Sorry my poor english<br />

You can buy a trinket which teleports you right there. There's also a location in Gogrond which teleports you to the Isle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not with MoP TW, it should be in the sanctuaries in the valley and not on timeless isle. And it does not matter if i play on pvp realm, its unfair, 20 hordes on NPC ganking others players. Do you think it's fair?</div></div><hr />

You should really just get away from whatever PvP realm you're playing on. PvP realms are rarely &quot;fair&quot;. You signed up for this, it is your own fault.</div></div><hr />

EVERY other TW BC, WOTLK and CATA each rep badge for 50 TW badges was 500 rep. I have been saving every one I have been getting to get one Pandaria rep to exalted because i missed the MOP expansion. Had over 4300 enough by every other expansion to get to exalted. Get to the Timeless Isle and rep tokens were 300 rep. I am Livid and it is taking even bit of professionalism I have not to swear. I am calling the local witch doctor to give me a voodoo doll for the developer that gave us this big cock up!</div></div><hr />

Some people only play on PvP realms because their friends did. I refuse to pay money to transfer characters to another realm because Blizzard can't or won't do anything about faction imbalance. <br />
<br />
It's stupid that the NPC is in a PvP zone. For the other Timewalking weeks its in a city.<br />
<br />
Constantly getting roflstomped by 30 Horde players every time Blizzard decides to have an event is the sorta thing that makes me wonder why I even play anymore.<br />
<br />
Spare me the &quot;PvP happened on a PvP server&quot; childishness.</div></div><hr />

If u can't stand it then either reroll horde, l2p or gtfo from this game. I mean if u roll on a pvp server then expect to get stomped whatever faction you choose that's the whole point of open world pvp to get your friends and charge to battle.. i'm so tired of ppl complaining they are getting raped cause they think world pvp is gay jesus man roll a pve server problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Shaohao should be 2k rep rep 50 since players can no longer access the rep farm area without the wellfare legendaries.</div></div><hr />

The only childish player here is you. It doesn't matter if you choose to play on that realm because of your friends. It's a pvp realm, take it as it is and stop whining.</div></div><hr />
