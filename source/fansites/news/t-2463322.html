The Call of the Scarab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/638-call-of-the-scarab) holiday event remembers the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj) world event from Vanilla. This event is an Alliance vs Horde showdown, with the victorious faction flying their faction banner for the next year. <br />
<br />
The Call of the Scarab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45785-call-of-the-scarab) quest will send you to Silithus so that you know where the vendor and world quests are. From there you can complete quests and defeat bosses to earn Commendations for your faction. Whichever faction has the most Commendations at the end of the event wins. <br />
<br />
Cultist Camps<br />
<br />
There are Twilight Cultist camps scattered around the zone.<br />
You will need to kill NPCs in the camp to acquire all three Cultist pieces: Twilight Cultist Cowl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143858-twilight-cultist-cowl), Twilight Cultist Mantle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143857-twilight-cultist-mantle), Twilight Cultist Robe (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143855-twilight-cultist-robe)<br />
Once you have applied all three pieces of the disguise, you can use a Lesser Wind stone to summon a NPC that you can solo. <br />
These drop Abyssal Crest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143865-abyssal-crest) and remove one of your armor buffs when summoned. <br />
Abyssal Crest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143865-abyssal-crest) are dropped by the Lesser Wind Stone bosses at the Cultist Camps.<br />
The Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143867-twilight-cultist-medallion-of-station) can be used at a Wind Stone to summon a boss that might need a group.<br />
The Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143866-twilight-cultist-ring-of-lordship) can be used at a Greater Wind Stone to summon a stronger boss that will need a group.<br />

Forbes Interview with Lead Game Designer Morgan Day<br />
Forbes interviewed (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/01/17/lead-designer-qa-world-of-warcraft-mythic-plus-dungeon-and-competition-changes/#3acbe60e2f91) lead game designer Morgan Day about Mythic Plus.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/morganday.jpg (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/01/17/lead-designer-qa-world-of-warcraft-mythic-plus-dungeon-and-competition-changes/#3acbe60e2f91) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
General Mythic Plus<br />
<br />
When originally designing Mythic dungeons for Bfa, the team added additional mechanics to trash on Mythic difficulty, but toned it down a bit further into the design process.<br />
The team strives to to make sure they're not doing anything that's going to play really poorly with Mythic Plus.<br />
The team learned from Legion that any mechanic involving damage ramping up over time has to have a soft cap for Mythic Plus or the fight becomes nearly impossible on Tyrannical.<br />
The team likes having rotating affixes each week to try and push people into different areas and different parts of content in a way that keeps it hopefully feeling a lot more fresh and interesting.<br />
The team likes variance, but if an affix or dungeon has too many outlying difficulty problems then they want to address those and bring them in line with the difficulty of other dungeons/affixes.<br />
It's actually a fixed list of hand-picked or hand-crafted affix combinations that come up every week.<br />
Fortified and Tyrannical are not being looked at for changes. Part of the problem these two affixes had was the seasonal affix Infested, which is going away. These issues will likely take care of themselves with its retirement.<br />
Reaping creatures don't gain Fortified themselves, but the way everything works is that the creature will spawn with half the health of the creature that dies, so in that regard it gets a small percentage of Fortified.<br />
Reaping enemies are only indirectly affected by affixes that alter the enemy trash's health amount. They do not gain damage bonuses or other effects.<br />
There are no immediate plans to allow people to delete their keys or swap for a new one, but the issue has been discussed among the team.<br />
Instead of giving players the option to delete keys, the team would rather bring the unpopular dungeons in line with the difficulty of the more popular ones.<br />
If your group doesn't have a key that you want to run, the ability to look for other keys in dungeon finder is an option.<br />
<br />
Mythic Dungeon International<br />
<br />
If you can do a certain number of Mythic Plus keys in time, that actually gets you invited into the Time Trial stage, and from there everyone's on the Tournament Realm.<br />
The Tournament Realm will give everyone an equal playing field with the same gear.</div></div><hr />

You can farm the real mounts inside the raid quickly, they can only be used inside there but they do count toward mount total I'm pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

Scribes or vendors should have a one use item to 'redirect' your key at some cost.</div></div><hr />

Confirming they do, yes.<br />

Make it Scribes, since currently their use is...uh, those change talent books?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simpliest change would be let you pick any key u want in exchange but with a minus 1-3 modifier, I guess 2 would be fair and it would work well enough with Blizzard's policy of stretching the gameplay as much as possible, because players would do say +12, get +13 of something they don't want, then reroll it to +11 and try their luck again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess that rarely happens... I mean, how are the odds?<br />
<br />
They could introduce some kind of NPC that allows you to put in your KS and randomize it again for a cost.. like -2.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huehuehue</div><div class="date">2019-01-22, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">why are they so scared of letting players run the dungeons that they want? Lets be honest, even with rerolling you still probably won't get the dungeon you want right away. why do they need to control and micro manage how we play? Let us have fun first, and if there's some really really crazy stuff going on, then reign it in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tziva</div><div class="date">2019-01-22, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've whined a lot about not being able to delete keys, but if they think the sole reason people delete keys is because dungeons are too hard and that the solution is just to make them easier, they're just simplifying a complex issue. Sure, a lot of times that is the issue, but there's plenty of times when the reason isn't the overall difficulty. For example, maybe the problem is the dungeon that week with those particular affixes. Sanguine Waycrest is the perfect example; Waycrest isn't a hard mythic and almost certainly does not need made easier. But it's a really really annoying dungeon with Sanguine and understandably people don't like doing it that week. It isn't a matter of &quot;bringing it in line with other dungeons.&quot; Aside from that, some people just have preferences that aren't necessarily related to the difficulty. For example, my two least favourite mythics are Shrine and Freehold - one of the hardest, and one of the easiest. I just don't enjoy them and I don't want to do them. The fact that Shrine is also challenging just makes it worse but you could nerf it to fucking hell and I still wouldn't want to be there. And on the other hand, my favourite is King's Rest, which is consistently one of the harder ones each week regardless of affixes. <br />
<br />
That said, there is definitely a lot of tuning and fixes that should be done to the dungeons so that way the same few aren't the hardest every week and the same few aren't the easiest every week. I think it's fine that some weeks are harder or easier in general due to affixes. I think it's fine if some dungeons are harder or easier than others due to affixes. I don't really think it's fine that it's the same few every week regardless of affixes. I do think that is a problem that should be addressed and should have probably been addressed a long time ago. In fact, I'm little irritated with the &quot;we don't want you to trash keys, we'd rather fix the reason we're trashing them&quot; statement to begin with. Maybe you should have aimed to bring them in line first and then removed the functionality rather than removing it under the &quot;someday we'll make this better!&quot; optimistic hope. In the meantime, people get stuck with keys they don't need or want and aren't fun to run and we're only seeing tiny little tweaks periodically that are not impacting the overall issue to any significant degree.<br />
<br />
Or just, you know, let people target particular dungeons. If someone wants to run Atal a billion times for whatever fucking reason, what is the harm? If a team never wants to do Siege, then okay? Or if a team really needs to get Shrine because it's the last one they need for their feat, they shouldn't be stuck feeling like they need to run like a dozen damn mythics every week in hopes they get the right key to finish things off. I don't really feel like there was any real downside to a system like we had in the CMs of past where a team just picked a specific dungeon to work on on a given week. The key system in general just seems like an odd choice, like it's trying to fix a problem or exploit that doesn't actually exist.<br />

<br />
It's a Micro-holiday, so it's just there for fun, like the Moonkin holiday where the 'reward' is a buff that lasts for 5 days with a small herd of Moonkin following you. In this case I think the 'reward' is the faction that does the most has it's flag by the gong until next year.</div></div><hr />

You mean tyr, bolstering, explosive? It can be rough in ToS sure. But it's not even close to impossible like people make it out to be. You just have to be a decent player and plan around the affixes since the only dangerous boss in there is the first one.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget how it trivialized Raid content. Path of least resistance and all that. I so look forward to Classic when all the CRAP that has piled on to make WoW such crap is gone.</div></div><hr />

Mythic+ by design isn't bad, but it has a lot of room for improvement which Blizzard ignored copy-pasting what existed in Legion into BfA. Not to mention mythic+ should NEVER reward with gear comparable to raids.</div></div><hr />

I suppose some people find it attractive, and perhaps it wouldn't be bad if overhauled to provide alternative gear, instead of equal gear. Blizzard went the way fo everything awards same stuff... in order to allow people to do what they like. Instead they should have incentivized everything differetnly to make ti fun and rewarding to do it all. But hey... can't leave anyone behind because they don't no life it right?<br />
<br />
Wrong. You can't make an MMO where time is trivialized... or you run off those people who stay with the game long term. Blizzard, I believe, still has not learned this... even though they get steep increases each expansion followed by larger and larger drops in participation.<br />
<br />
Classic will hopefully be the eye opener if it does as well as I suspect. Showing how a clear progression path makes for a much more rewarding experience than &quot;just go do anything you want&quot;. It turns the game into a sandbox rather than a meaningful, progression based, fantasy story that people want to continue with.</div></div><hr />
