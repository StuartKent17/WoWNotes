Seems the easier fix would be to buff VT/SW:P/MF and nerf DP; I understand it's supposed to be something to use on 3 orbs but (especially in PvP) when it deals that large a chunk of your damage you can't afford to not have it up (Speaking in terms of use of Psychic Horror in PvP).</div></div><hr />

I don't get it either. I guess 1 month (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5633973536?page=15#300) is too long to go without changing a feature that was largely settled with most of the people happy...<br />

<br />
Guess it's because of &quot;Sanctity of Battle (Retribution) Melee haste effects lower the cooldown and global cooldown of your Judgment, Crusader Strike, Hammer of the Righteous, Exorcism, and Hammer of Wrath&quot;. Forcing us into stacking haste I assume. Rotations be damned, button mash whatever is off cooldown!<br />

I preferred us in WotLK (of course, I really preferred the pre-balance before WotLK, but we were decent during WotLK). Life was simpler. Plus I could stack high end PvE gear and one shot low geared 80s in Battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

No, as they nerfed AB's damage by 10% to compensate for the increase in damage off of arcane charges. This was mentioned in the beta class balance analysis thread.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raar</div><div class="date">2012-08-08, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is with those HUGE hunter nerfs<br />
About 2 patches ago they doubled the damage on most of their stuff, then last patch they took like 50% of that back off, now their taking another 20%,. Dunno how they overshot it so hard in the first place, but hunters have been way ahead since they got their numbers doubled a couple weeks ago and the nerf has been needed. Nothing against hunter, just want to see a balanced game at launch.<br />
<br />
Off hunters onto Druids, I agree with people complaining actually, they need to stop jumping back and forth on the durations and just balance around them. I beleive their idea is they want players to refresh both dots at the start of every eclipse and thats pretty much the only time. So depending on the duration and talents you take, the dots might run out right as u refresh them each time, or with being shortened run out b4 u hit the next one. I used to play a boomkin and I know that its very annoying when your dot duration doesn't line up decently with how long it takes to go between eclipses.<br />
<br />
And one final note, no warrior changes again :( Guess they're happy with where we're at. I really was hoping execute would get a slight nerf so our damage above 20% hp could be buffed a little. With execute phases often being burn phases, they end up lasting less than 10% of the fight duration even though execute is being figured for 20% of the fight. (bosses health)<br />
<br />
Overall good patch, looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean this in a condescending way, but maybe you're doing something wrong because in beta on my 90 warrior I very rarely hit gaps with nothing to push, although I admittedly almost never get to use heroic strike either.

Have you watched Method streaming raids on the main page over the last week or 2? They are a very solid guild with good members and while doing raid testing they had 3 hunters in their raid (one of each spec) and all 3 of them were pretty much always the top 3 dps except for a few gimmicky fights.<br />
<br />
As for PvP I can't say too much other than I've done 3-4 BG's today and every one of them had hunters in at least 4 of the top 6 spots when sorting by damage done. I know that doesn't mean a real lot for pvp balance, but it does lean toward their damage being too high.</div></div><hr />

one other thing i forgot to add in... about 3-4 days ago I dueled a hunter, he went into stealth and when he opened up on me i was instantly at half health (130k powershot on a plate wearer + ridiculously fast auto attacks from cooldowns and spamming the hell out of arcane shot for I dont remember how much, but enough to kill me with full 483 pvp gear b4 i could barely touch him.

About pvp the BG's that you were in,those hunters should be mostly of them Beast mastery everybody knew that bm's dmg was ridiculous... But that is just a dumb decision by blizzard they buffed all the 3 specs at the same time and now they figure out that the dmg is too high they should atleast nerf 2 specs and leave one on the top(or near the top)to not screw the pvp players and that spec should be MM but they don't care they just nerf all the 3 specs thats frustrating for people who mostly care about pvp you know...<br />

Please, if you earned the mount you earned it and as such have the right to use it on any character available, this includes ones you can MAIL to an alt.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2012-08-08, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some more blue posts from the Beta Class Balance Analysis (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/227466-beta-class-balance-analysis/), this one for hunters...<br />
Is there a design purpose in why aimed shot, powershot and barrage all suppress autoshot? [...] For MM in particular, it seems to conflict with the design of the mastery, since suppressing autoshot will reduce wild quiver procs and long cast time shots mean less chances for wild quiver procs as well. [...]<br />
Aimed Shot should feel different, like you’re distinctly pausing to precisely aim a perfect shot. That’s mostly a kit thing. In terms of gameplay, it reinforces that Arcane Shot should usually be your primary focus dump (but Aimed being a better dump during periods of high haste is cool and something that we do intend to continue supporting). Powershot was in a similar boat, but we changed our mind on that, in order to help balance the talent row; in the new build going up now it no longer interrupts Auto Shot. Barrage still seems weird to allow Autos during, but it does give you more Wild Quiver procs on average so handles the balance concern.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...And another regarding class balancing in general.<br />
Ret took it to the face this build. Was it 'doing more damage than intended'?<br />
No, just you Chaz.<br />
<br />
We have made several adjustments based on player feedback, raid testing, and fixing some bugs. Some of the changes were made to keep secondary stats scaling appropriately and some were when specs were doing too much damage. Here's a quick cheat sheet for where we are. Even &quot;tuned&quot; does not mean set in stone and ready for ship.<br />
<br />
Priest -- Shadow roughly tuned.<br />
Warlock -- roughly tuned except for Sacrifice.<br />
Mage -- roughly tuned except Arcane and Invocation.<br />
Druid -- Feral and Balance tuned except for Dream of Cenarius.<br />
Paladin -- Ret roughly tuned.<br />
Rogue -- tuned (but we'll look at Assassination numbers posted above).<br />
Shaman -- tuned.<br />
Hunter -- tuned.<br />
<br />
We are working on monk, warrior and DK next.<br />
<br />
<br />
So remember: Even though we are ever getting closer to the release date for Mists of Pandaria, there is still plenty going on behind the scenes in the beta. (And I greatly encourage people to go through at least the blue tracker version of the topic.) ;)<br />

Well that is interesting, to actually label hunters as tuned when this next build is such a jump for them is quite shocking to me. Same with balance druids. Glad to see the 3 classes they still need to look at though, DKs are a bit high and Warriors are too low. Really hope Fury pulls ahead of arms for MoP... Warriors wielding 2 massive weapons is just a great sight and a waste to not be seen.</div></div><hr />

No, just you Chaz.<br />
<br />
We have made several adjustments based on player feedback, raid testing, and fixing some bugs. Some of the changes were made to keep secondary stats scaling appropriately and some were when specs were doing too much damage. Here's a quick cheat sheet for where we are. Even &quot;tuned&quot; does not mean set in stone and ready for ship.<br />
<br />
Priest -- Shadow roughly tuned.<br />
Warlock -- roughly tuned except for Sacrifice.<br />
Mage -- roughly tuned except Arcane and Invocation.<br />
Druid -- Feral and Balance tuned except for Dream of Cenarius.<br />
Paladin -- Ret roughly tuned.<br />
Rogue -- tuned (but we'll look at Assassination numbers posted above).<br />
Shaman -- tuned.<br />
Hunter -- tuned.<br />
<br />
We are working on monk, warrior and DK next.<br />
<br />
rogues was tuned the moment they released the talent trees, as usual we dont get changes, and all specs are too similar now, hopefully we wont be forced into combat for another expansion, since we now look as booring as we always have been, rogue population will drop to all time low.</div></div><hr />

I can sort of understand why Blizzard removed their account-wide status, but I still think it would have been nice if they had stayed at account level.<br />
<br />
IMO, I am disappointed with the mounts changes. To be brutally honest, the only mounts that should NOT be account wide are the PVP-mounts (RBG and Arena mounts) and the class mounts. They said that was their intent in a previous blue post - and without another blue post to state that there's been a change in stance I'd like to hope the change (in this build for the mounts mentioned) is a temporary thing, and will be reverted before going live.<br />
<br />
Also in my 2 cents, the thing that disappoints me most is that I was, at one time, in a level 17 guild and helped get it to 25. I got the mount with the character that was in that guild; but, not long afterward many things began to happen that caused myself and my wife to leave that guild. I helped get one guild to level 25 ... but this change effectively penalizes us (if it stays that way and goes live that way) in that our other characters will never see it until the day we manage to get our own small guild to level 25.. which might happen in 2 more expansions without just opening the floodgates to all sorts of.. unknowns.

Unnecessary indeed, IMO. As I said, I HOPE it is a temporary change just for the sake of this build and only for this build. I can understand the PVP (RBG, Arena) mounts being made &quot;non account-wide&quot; due to win-trading issues (RBG) and the fact that comps between seasons might make it difficult if not impossible to earn those mounts (arena) on multiple toons... Yet, any toon could get the guild mounts, provided they are in a level 25 guild and have.. Honored( (I think?) reputation with the guild purchase them. =\ Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, to be fair, boomkins were needing to be tuned down, however, the way Blizzard does things boggles my mind. If one class is doing too much damage (especially in beta), wouldn't it make sense to lower one ability at a time to try to get things in line. Instead, they change a bunch of stuff that interacts making it way harder to predict how it will affect overall dps. I'm sure that balance isn't in it's final state at them moment, but I just thing they could do a better job tuning by not changing so many things at once.</div></div><hr />

Edit - <br />
Nevermind - Saw in the FAQ you can create a new character<br />
**On the SoR. Not familiar with it but as you wouldn't have a monk on an account that was eligible does their exclusion actually mean anything. I thought you picked which one got the level 80 boost when you accept on your account.**</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything, if SoR doesn't work (i.e. instant level 80 monk), then I'd say the odds are that RaF won't work either, as it's basically the same thing, just with more effort involved. And you can apply the SoR level 80 bonus to a new character you make after you get resurrected.</div></div><hr />

The clear difference is worgen/goblins are races and monk is a class. There was no world first worgen/goblin ach. (facepalm)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still not a sufficient reason. People could use SoR to get a level 80 character for a class they've never used so working for a Monk is no different.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I said realm first not world first. (Edit - and after checking I see there weren't any race firsts due to the race change being available).</div></div><hr />

Its not the same thing, on SoR u get a FREE 80 char, just with the 10 FREE days, and u can have it and dont pay any penny to blizz ever, in RaF u have to PAY to give levels, so u guys forget that we are talking about Bli$$ard and of course they will allow this, as it was allowed to DK, wich had a RF and was enabled...</div></div><hr />

It was applicable to dks, but RaF only went to level 60 then. So you got a whopping half a level of exp bonus out of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are these beta build changes the changes to the build before or to the life version on the servers? If the first is right, is there anywhere an overview over the actuall changes from live to beta or MoP (so far)<br />
<br />
Greetz MortnMX<br />
The first is correct. There isn't any patch notes provided in the beta because it's really just one really huge patch. I suppose you could take the data-mined info here on MMO-C and compare it to what you know is current on live, but I think you'll find rather tedious considering just how many changes can happen in the beta (albeit there's not as many now as there were when the beta first began). There will be a patch note provided once the beta ends, though, so look forward to seeing the list sometime around mid-September.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2012-08-08, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, I am disappointed with the mounts changes. To be brutally honest, the only mounts that should NOT be account wide are the PVP-mounts (RBG and Arena mounts) and the class mounts. They said that was their intent in a previous blue post - and without another blue post to state that there's been a change in stance I'd like to hope the change (in this build for the mounts mentioned) is a temporary thing, and will be reverted before going live.<br />
<br />
Also in my 2 cents, the thing that disappoints me most is that I was, at one time, in a level 17 guild and helped get it to 25. I got the mount with the character that was in that guild; but, not long afterward many things began to happen that caused myself and my wife to leave that guild. I helped get one guild to level 25 ... but this change effectively penalizes us (if it stays that way and goes live that way) in that our other characters will never see it until the day we manage to get our own small guild to level 25.. which might happen in 2 more expansions without just opening the floodgates to all sorts of.. unknowns. Sigh - FFS Blizzard.<br />
Oh I am in complete agreement with you, Invictus. I've got plenty of alts that I would just love have being able to ride the guild mounts without needing to sink gold into them. And I'm sorry to hear about you finding it necessary to leave a guild that you invested so much in. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Either Resto Shammies are underpowered, or Resto Monks/Pallies are very very strong because everytime i did the LFR this past weekend Resto Shammies were at the bottom while Monks and Pallies were at the top. Spinning Crane Kick was kicking every other healz butt. :(<br />
<br />
Sad to not see that addressed this Build<br />

Reducing main abilities by 30% and more is just crazy. I play my hunter for almost 3 years now and every time I've got excited about something, 2 weeks after they nerfed us. Might as well play another class or not play at all because I feel like we are worthless now. Making us balanced and all other BS people are saying is just some nerdish word to me because it is just a way to convince people that these changes are not too bad and it's just for the good of the game.<br />
<br />
I would suggest just give us a bow and auto-shot. That might calm all the pvp kids and make them stop crying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who knows just went and killed some level 90's and couple 90 elites on the packs multishot is still hitting for over 130k dps according to skada and I am a ok hunter and on the elites I am doing roughly about the same dps as I was before the patch hit and the elites go down fast. This and the fact I am using the free pvp gear at the moment might help explain it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read my post above yours you will see that multishot initial burst is hitting for 130k+ on level 90 packs of mobs and elites seemed to go down just as fast as before. But I am survival spec not MM or BM..<br />
<br />
Well yes single target dps is meh atm and the elites very wildly in how fast they go down.</div></div><hr />

I.e. making some bonuses for dailies only = forcing us to do dailies. And how about players, who don't like dailies? When dailies was alternative to heroics, everybody has chosen the second ones. Why? Just because dailies are boring. And so forcing players to do, what they don't want to do - is a bad idea and Cataclysm have already shown that. Developers want to step on the same rake again?</div></div><hr />
