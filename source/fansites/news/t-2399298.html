Blizzard recently made an adjustment to what artifact appearances are going away in Battle for Azeroth. The appearance awarded for completing a Mythic +15 will now still be obtainable after Legion ends. This means that only the Mage Tower base artifact appearances will no longer be available to unlock in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
As testing continues in the Battle for Azeroth Beta, and we specifically consider the transition from Legion to BFA, weâ€™ve decided to make the existing Keystone Master achievement permanent. There will not be a new achievement for completing a Mythic 15 or higher dungeon in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
The artifact appearance associated with Keystone Master will still be available in Battle For Azeroth. Players can earn the achievement in Legion through August 13, or players can complete a Mythic 15 BFA dungeon at level 120, once Mythic Keystone difficulty opens a few weeks after the launch of Battle For Azeroth.<br />
<br />
This means that the only artifact appearance that will become unobtainable with Battle For Azeroth is the Mage Tower base appearance.<br />
<br />
As always, thank you for your feedback!</div></div><hr />

Still think they could set up a special scaling and gear system for those who want to go back and complete special legacy content like the mage tower and challenge dungeons in the future whilst making it so they won't be able to take advantage of the higher ilvl gear soft nerf of the challenge that people would have had when they did it as recent content. Basically keep it a challenge by setting players to a certain level and giving them a certain stats set up with which they have to complete the content if they hope to unlock the old cool stuff.</div></div><hr />

It's not like they're just giving it away (not any more than they already are at least). If you don't have it now, you'll still need to do Balance of power and a 15 in time in BFA. They're not making it significantly easier or harder by the looks of it, it's exactly the same. <br />
<br />
Besides, it's just one color variant of that specific appearance. I doubt most people even know what the tint is for most of the weapons just from memory. Hardly anyone is going to care that your assassination daggers are red instead of green. Not to mention that some classes probably won't even use a weapon that can be transmogrified into the artifact when the expansion comes out and adds normal weapons once again. If a resto shaman ends up using a staff, that ever so prestigious hammer tint is going to mean nothing.</div></div><hr />

It in incredibly stupid, but they insist on catering to the 5% population of elitist d-bags who just can't enjoy something unless they know other people don't have access to it. Not sure why rewarding their arrogance at the expense of the majority of their players is a good business choice, but it's their player-base to alienate... not mine.<br />

When they remove things in the game it only makes me want to play the game less. Especially when we are told something will be removed and I feel superstressed trying to get it in time and end up becoming burnout :/</div></div><hr />

If it is for the sake of 'people who did it will have rewards for working for something when it was current content', opposed to those who didn't finish or play at the time, then it's weird in my honest opinion.<br />

They are only removing the mage tower quest so you cant do it at lvl120. Without the quest you cant get apprearances. If you have done the quest you can get all the apprearances.</div></div><hr />

I know them feels broski, like shit now I have to spend every waking moment working towards this or I can never get it again. I'm glad they at least give us a good bit of time, it would be truly terrible if they waited till the last minute to tell us or didn't say anything at all.</div></div><hr />

Not being able to collect all the things certainly puts a giant dampener on even starting to collecting things for me. Even if I was never going to collect all the things. I lost a huge chunk of enjoyment out of gw2 when they decided to put in a pvp event in their timed event achievements, which I at the time had 100% on all in, i didn't get said ach and subsequently i never got a 100% in a timed event again, no point as all enjoyment was lost in doing it.</div></div><hr />

I gave up on WoW at this point because i'm gonna miss out on those appearances. It's not that i can't beat them, but i don't really want to repeat the same content over 10-20 times. I don't have all alts at 110, much less at 950ilvl or whatever to beat it. (yes, i beat a few of them at less than 910).<br />
<br />
I WISH i could still get them in BFA while my character is still at lvl 110.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better solution to that would be locking the quest availability to 110 as a maximum. That way you can lock experience gain on your character and still work for them at any given time, rather than removing content for the sake of removing exclusive content restricted to one expansion.<br />
<br />
I mean, it renders it obsolete because imagine if a new player comes (child ages up enough to play the game) two expansions from now and sees a Demon Hunter with awesome burning glaives, gets a boner and wants to compete with the challenge for it. Bad luck eh? Growing up in the wrong time and not being able to do it now, supoose it's a generation issue.</div></div><hr />

1. Fact that they removed it gives us more reason to play current content, simply as that. I can't speak for other, but if they wouldn't remove anything, I'd just unsubscribe and wait for more exciting months. Now I must get decent gear, level my weapon, grab some legendaries, consumables, learn how to play spec and fight itself. This must works, because they have been doing this for years.<br />
<br />
2. They warned you almost YEAR ago. Also, they revealed release date sooner than usual. Now they even gave more than promise with M+15 change (that can be more frustrating than Mage Tower, because in addition to whole gearing/learning process you also must find decent group).<br />
And what you do in response? Whine of course. Jesus, this is so pathetic.</div></div><hr />

You only need to complete the quest/challenge for the Mage Tower artifact skin, for the base model.<br />
You can do the rest of the tints at your own leisure, whether before or 5 expansions after Battle for Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

That is still doing the mage tower 36 times because maybe just maybe some day you will class change. Or blizzard will make the artifact mogs free game.<br />

So if I understand this right, as long as you've unlocked the base appearance by clearing the mage tower you'll be able to unlock the other tints in BfA if you haven't had the time, right?Yes they mentioned this some time ago. I would link the tweet from WarcraftDevs but I can't post links on here.<br />
<br />
Here is what it says though: &quot;UPDATE: If you unlock the Mage Tower's base appearance before the end of the expansion, you can obtain the color variants for that appearance post-Legion.&quot;<br />

It all started with the ZA bear. At the time achievements were new, so anyone who actually obtained the bear mount felt special. As time went on, they stopped doing this with mounts but then Draenor came around and we got the moose mount from Heroic/Mythic Archimonde. I see it from both sides. I do wish some things weren't removed just because but I also understand why some things in this game are considered special. The Mage Tower challenge makes sense to go away though. It's a challenge for level 110 players. After 110, what's the point of it having been a challenge if it would still be available? :/</div></div><hr />

They don't do this NEARLY enough.<br />
<br />
And I haven't played seriously since sometime before the Arcanist's Manasaber came out with a brief return during the Dragons of Nightmare event so it's damn near impossible for me to come back and gear up enough to get that artifact appearance at this point I think. I'm 875 ilvl. Actually thought I was lower but still...<br />
I REALLY wanted the Prot Warrior one so I could rock it with the Garrosh shoulders one day. FUUUUCK.</div></div><hr />

There are so many catch up mechanisms including free 910 items for a bit of solo farming on Argus that if you really cared to gear up for mage tower, you could definitely manage in the 1+ month we have left. People have done it when we haven't had free concordance (free because it requires basically 2 world quests from 0), no netherlight crucible buffing weapon 15 ilvls, no ilvl 1000 legendaries (if you have lower ones you can definitely grind the upgrade item twice within few weeks) and no 910+ gear.</div></div><hr />

As someone with 33/36 Mage tower appearances (no real desire to get the monk ones but will probably do it anyway), I have absolutely no problem with them keeping those skins available forever. Other people having them doesn't diminish from my gaming experience.</div></div><hr />

If you do the Argus stuff you should be able to get to 930 within a few weeks. From there you can get into an Antorus normal group and you should be able to brute force the prot challenge. At least that's what I did.<br />

But yeah, I agree it sucks that they remove things as liberally as they do.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that the Mage Tower is going away in the pre-patch as confirmed by Ythisens, and if it releases 6 weeks prior like the Legion one did, we're looking at the beginning of June, putting the remaining weeks to farm Mage Towers at 5 or 6. It might work if he's really lucky, farms all antorus bosses like a champ or manages to get a normal antorus boost somehow, but it won't be easy or guaranteed at this point.</div></div><hr />

I mean you can get 3x910 tokens weekly by just doing the two quests, clearing minor invasions and if you really want more you can do dailies with veiled argunite reward. There is 17 slots of gear, two which will be covered by legendaries and 3 of them are relics. Getting 3x910 relics is great but not required. You can get the required gear without having to waste time with pug raids.</div></div><hr />

I doubt most people even know what the tint is for most of the weapons just from memory. Hardly anyone is going to care that your assassination daggers are red instead of green. Not to mention that some classes probably won't even use a weapon that can be transmogrified into the artifact when the expansion comes out and adds normal weapons once again. If a resto shaman ends up using a staff, that ever so prestigious hammer tint is going to mean nothing.<br />
<br />
This is a concern I really hope will be adressed.<br />
<br />
I am currently wearing a MH+OH combo on the beta because that was the best option for me, but my artifct weapon is a staff... I am gonna be so disappointed if I end up not being able to use my artifact apperances, or any other stave mogs in BFA, because MH+OH design is better stat wise... I always hated that combo!<br />
<br />
I haven't started gearing properly on the beta btw, so I am not 100% sure it will continue like this, but right now I am, and knwoing the past... where staves were never an option(I have a vague memory of them changing up things, to make staves more attractive stat wise, but i didn't play much duing MoP and WoD so if it happened then I would not know), I'm &quot;scared&quot; I'll be forced into MH+OH again.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those who absolutely loved my artifact weapon, and I'm really gonna miss it. Part of the reason why I miss it, might have been because it was a staff. Not so fond of it on my alts that were forced into MH+OH(shadow priest e.g.)</div></div><hr />

That contradicts their earlier statements, which were that you can earn the other three tints post-Legion IF you earned the base appearance DURING Legion.<br />
<br />
They are technically accurate in that statement, but not very clear. If you want ANY Mage Tower appearance, get the base one during Legion, and then you have all the time in the world to do 10 Legion Dungeons, kill heroic KJ or do 10 Rated BGs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3x910 equals 650x3 = 1950 veiled argunite (VA). You get 500 from the weekly quests, so that's 1450 to come from minor invasions, I can't remember exactly how much you get per invasion, but isn't it like 40 so you'd need like 5-6 invasions per day? I guess that's actually doable, I just never could be bothered since I always geared several toons at once.<br />
<br />
Even so, 910-915 is pretty low ilvl to do the mage tower, especially one as challenging as prot warrior, and especially if you haven't done Kruul on any other character. Might be doable since it's his main, but as I said, it won't be easy or guaranteed at this point unless he can get some normal antorus clears and get at least 930+ ilvl.<br />

No, you need the base appearance to get all the other tints. Although that particular quote was pretty vague, they've been extremely clear about this in earlier posts.<br />
<br />
Mage Towers will only be up until the Pre-patch. If you haven't done it by then you won't be able to get any of the tints. But if you have done the mage tower by then, you can unlock the 3 remaining tints in BFA and forward.</div></div><hr />

Out of a metric fuckton of appearances, mounts, titles etc, yeah...a few are obtainable for people who can then feel special. <br />

I mean, it renders it obsolete because imagine if a new player comes (child ages up enough to play the game) two expansions from now and sees a Demon Hunter with awesome burning glaives, gets a boner and wants to compete with the challenge for it.

<br />
If they weren't deactivating all your artifact traits, and doing a massive level scaling change that would require tons of rebalancing on all the challenges to keep them actually challenging, they may have kept them for 110s only. They also can't just scale them or they may become too easy or too hard if they don't scale them enough. <br />
<br />
I mean, for fucks sake the damn tower has been available for over a year now. If you don't have all the mage tower skins you care about, then you never cared enough in the first place. I myself only got like 8 of them or so. I couldn't give less of a shit if I don't have the other 28 when they go away. People really need to get over this idea that they should always have access to everything. It's completely fine that there are some things, especially as minor as a fucking weapon skin, that are only available for a &quot;short&quot; (1 year is not short) period of time or only for those who excel at the game.</div></div><hr />

That's true, but the content in the games wasn't getting removed arbitrarily just so the early adopters could feel special.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying these sorts of things should necessarily be easier to obtain over time, just that they shouldn't be removed. More achievements like the Algalon one that requires you being at X level with gear at a certain point, for example. That way it's not soloable but it's still obtainable. Wouldn't that be better than creating a situation where a new player looks at a thing they want, learns they can never obtain it because it was only available for a year, and then finds out about a ton of other similar situations, where all the 'unique' stuff can't be earned any more?</div></div><hr />

Removing Mage Tower makes sense because it's something like MoP and WoD challenges, but instead of grouping up for a dungeon, it's solo challenges. But M+ is not going away, so they could keep the skin variant obtainable. They probably should retire M+ in the transition phase from Legion to BfA though, parallel to disabling Mage Tower. Pre-patches usually screw up all class mechanics, on the other hand, with current levels of gear, M+15 is not that hard anymore.<br />

Anyway, I'm glad I got this already for all classes, but good thing for people who did not have the time yet.<br />

What do they mean with &quot;base&quot; appearance ? Does that mean if you done one Mage Tower for one of your specs, you can still get the other ones for your other specs in BfA ?<br />
<br />
No, it means if you have completed the challenge on one spec, you get the base skin for that spec. And you will be able to get the variants of this base skin in BfA just as well. But you will not be able to get the skins for the other specs anymore, neither base nor variants.</div></div><hr />

They left in the Green Fire, but that didn't require an immense load of Legionfall War Supplies, or only stay up a few days of the week.<br />

Blizzard's policy has been that exclusivity is fine, especially stuff that's mostly aesthetic.<br />

Or you know...... use the tech that now exists and make it scale to the max / average ilvl you should've had when you did it.<br />

Blizzard isn't concerned that the Black Temple is still perfectly balanced and challenging. Even if you do it &quot;proper&quot; with a group of 25, all locked at level 70, and ban races and classes that weren't available at the time, the level crushes over the years and heirloom gear makes it little more than a face-roll now. Why should the final quest of an overworld quest chain be any different than when you out-level and/or out-gear literally everything else in the game?<br />
<br />
I enjoy doing the quests to see what happens. I do old collection and class-specific quests that don't mean anything anymore because I like experiencing them. For the Mage Tower, I'm not upset that the exclusive artifact weapon tints are going away (I do want the opportunity to get them, though), I'm upset that the quest line is no longer completable. Same for the Khadgar campaign in Draenor and the Black Prince campaign in Pandaria. I don't care if Blizzard nerfs or deletes the legendary reward at the end, I just wanted to play that content first-hand, without having to watch someone else do it on YouTube. I wanted that experience under my own characters' belts. But if I can't keep up because I have a social life and job that always take priority over a video game (that is honestly in and of itself a full-time job if you want to do everything), I have to miss out.<br />
<br />
It seems silly that Blizzard would write and script a whole storyline, complete with voice acting, then just nuke it after a couple of years thereby preventing anyone from seeing it ever again. Especially when they constantly remind us how they can only make so much content for each expansion and large swaths of what they plan to do gets cut because there isn't enough time. What a waste.</div></div><hr />

There is 17 slots of gear, two which will be covered by legendaries and 3 of them are relics. Getting 3x910 relics is great but not required. You can get the required gear without having to waste time with pug raids.<br />
<br />
IDK I did some challenges at an item level of 905-910 (no tier set, stat stick trinkets) when I got the right legendaries and usually also unlocked 4th golden trait. Others have been manageable at at item level of up to 930, when I did not have recommended legendaries, or did not know the spec. So, if you don't aim for all 36 challenges, you could get some done before the pre-patch hits. Agatha is surely one of the easiest now, because you can steamroll her with consumables, and probably even have luck to have Command Center buffs. Helped me a lot with Feral and Fury challenges, because I have literally just set up action bars before going into the challenges, and needed a handful of tries. Sigryn and Tugar are also relatively easy, because they are all about mechanics. Twins are a bit specific, and Xylem is not only mechanics but also a DPS race. And tank and healer challenges are special, anyway.<br />
<br />
So - everything depends on the challenges which you are about to face. Though I did guardian druid without Luffa or Eko, and Affliction without the legendary ring, so it's also a thing of motivation, time and resilience.</div></div><hr />

Its been sounding like they will be once BFA hits. Whether they become spec-specific, who knows, but they'll definitely still only be usable by the appropriate class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corroc</div><div class="date">2018-05-24, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3x910 equals 650x3 = 1950 veiled argunite (VA). You get 500 from the weekly quests, so that's 1450 to come from minor invasions, I can't remember exactly how much you get per invasion, but isn't it like 40 so you'd need like 5-6 invasions per day? I guess that's actually doable, I just never could be bothered since I always geared several toons at once.<br />
<br />
Even so, 910-915 is pretty low ilvl to do the mage tower, especially one as challenging as prot warrior, and especially if you haven't done Kruul on any other character. Might be doable since it's his main, but as I said, it won't be easy or guaranteed at this point unless he can get some normal antorus clears and get at least 930+ ilvl.<br />
You get 500 from the quests 40-50 from minor invasion and 100 from greater invasion. Doing 6 invasions a day basically means you log in twice a day. From my experience it doesn't matter if you haven't done the challenge before. Every single class is different.<br />

This was my alt that I did the challenge with. I had no problems with hitting dps requirement only problems were the mechanics.<br />

Its the same as legion. We had couple weeks of mythics before the raid launched. M+ started same time as did mythic EN.</div></div><hr />

And the early weeks are a &quot;protection&quot; time so people don't feel the rush to level, open it immediately and slow levellers will be locked out of pugs because the tryhards will already demand ilvl / achiev / raider.io by week1. Same reason why raids are closed for 3 weeks or so. So people can &quot;have a life&quot;, level up at their pace and still be at equal standing when the &quot;race&quot; opens for everyone.<br />

Well you can still obtain the dragon soul rogue daggers or firelands staff, so not &quot;every raid quest&quot; is removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish they would stop removing things from the game to keep them 'exclusive'.<br />
<br />
On the contrary, i feel like removing things makes those who have been around for longer feel like they have something to show for having been there, although i am sortof salty about it since i had an account hacked which contained a bunch of old stuff, i am still happy they are sticking to their word on the mage tower appearances</div></div><hr />

<br />
AQ bug, titles that were removed, Frostscythe you can only try to get once a year.<br />
<br />
WoW is pretty much a game that runs on exclusivity for exclusivity's sake... What game have you been playing? It was that way even back in Vanilla when it wasn't removing things after a set period of time, it was making them insanely difficult to grind for without massive groups.</div></div><hr />

I wonder what kind of business model can actively justify making unavailable products the consumer paid for that artists and developers spent man hours on.<br />
<br />
Just seems kind of silly that &quot;EXCLUSIVITY&quot; is this driving force behind people and their nonsensical needs in a digital environment. It's actually pretty damn petty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrosis</div><div class="date">2018-05-25, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard isn't concerned that the Black Temple is still perfectly balanced and challenging. Even if you do it &quot;proper&quot; with a group of 25, all locked at level 70, and ban races and classes that weren't available at the time, the level crushes over the years and heirloom gear makes it little more than a face-roll now. Why should the final quest of an overworld quest chain be any different than when you out-level and/or out-gear literally everything else in the game?<br />
<br />
I enjoy doing the quests to see what happens. I do old collection and class-specific quests that don't mean anything anymore because I like experiencing them. For the Mage Tower, I'm not upset that the exclusive artifact weapon tints are going away (I do want the opportunity to get them, though), I'm upset that the quest line is no longer completable. Same for the Khadgar campaign in Draenor and the Black Prince campaign in Pandaria. I don't care if Blizzard nerfs or deletes the legendary reward at the end, I just wanted to play that content first-hand, without having to watch someone else do it on YouTube. I wanted that experience under my own characters' belts. But if I can't keep up because I have a social life and job that always take priority over a video game (that is honestly in and of itself a full-time job if you want to do everything), I have to miss out.<br />
<br />
It seems silly that Blizzard would write and script a whole storyline, complete with voice acting, then just nuke it after a couple of years thereby preventing anyone from seeing it ever again. Especially when they constantly remind us how they can only make so much content for each expansion and large swaths of what they plan to do gets cut because there isn't enough time. What a waste.<br />
<br />
Yea, it is a bit strange that they didn't just remove the rewards but retain the quest lines for those who like the story.</div></div><hr />
