Patch 5.3 - Heirloom Shields<br />
Patch 5.2 added two new Heirloom shields to the game, but there were some issues with them and they never were added to vendors. <br />
<br />
It appears the issues have been resolved, and we will see http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/93903.jpg Weathered Observer's Shield (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93903-weathered-observers-shield) and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/93902.jpg Flamescarred Draconian Deflector (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93902-flamescarred-draconian-deflector) in Patch 5.3 at the cost of 2175 Justice Points.<br />

Ghostcrawler on Tri Spec<br />
It appears uniqueness is part of the reason we won't be seeing Tri Spec (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/march/ThirdSpec.png) in Patch 5.3.<br />

Stack ranking healers based on meters is like stack ranking cars based on max speed. It doesn't tell the whole story. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328220602638942208))<br />
<br />
Are you guys really okay with months of LFR becoming useless by Valor Gear? All that time spent on gear is wasted.<br />
Aren't you always replacing your gear every few months though? What is the specific valor concern? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327542805033525250))<br />
<br />
What's diff between reason Blizz used 4 shared lock-out vs. normal raiders feel complld to do normal+LFR each week?<br />
Why do you run LFR as a N raider? What is there for you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325342066139860992))<br />
Valor Points. At our current progression we are still scrapping for any source of upgrade. Plus the SP-A rep to buy.<br />
You won't get additional rep for doubling up, but if you are on e.g. 3rd boss in N then it might make sense to do the rest in LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325380040051261440))<br />
To be fair, that's fairly min-max behavior. If you're on 3rd boss on N, a couple more valor pieces isn't what's holding you back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325380256229896193))<br />
Normal Raiders feel the LFR mandatory cus of the stuff. LFR ToT stuff ilvl should be = to 489 to prevent that.<br />
If you're a N raider, you are earning 522+ ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382465864736768))<br />
If you don't have much 522 because you're stuck on an early boss, then getting a few 502 probably isn't what's blocking you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382667862413313))<br />
If you like earning ilevel as fast as possible, by all means go for it, but I wouldn't consider it mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325382772493520896))<br />
<br />
Didn't you just hotfix nerf health in Horridon and Sounds like a gear issue to me. Those weren't mechanic nerfs.<br />
We don't make fights that are target dummies. Nerfing numbers means you can afford more mistakes on the mechanics. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325404609424285696))<br />
As I said, if improving gear is fun for you, that's great. Just don't obsess unnecessarily over marginal ilevel improvements. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325404827528077312))<br />
<br />
We need Normal tuned down. The amount of non heroic guilds finishing Nrrmals in time is negligible<br />
We're happy with N difficulty for 25. It was a little hard for 10s, but we made some fixes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325341120282386432))<br />
<br />
for 'real' raiders progression is the motivation. raiding for loot is an outdated vanilla attitude.<br />
That hasn't been our experience. Raiding is fun, but becomes less so the moment you stop getting rewards. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307703071236097))<br />
<br />
What's with the can't release spirit until whole raid whipes mechanic? I find it kinda annoying I wish I knew why it was there<br />
It solved a whole lot of problems where players wouldn't get credit or loot if they released before a kill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307384320892928))<br />
<br />
I'd always thought testing times are based on when you guys can get all *your* hands on deck to observe, no?<br />
There's an element of that for sure. Being on the west coast doesn't always work to our advantage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325032929992507393))<br />
If you're a two-night-a-week guild, are you going to sacrifice one of those just to help us out? I mean we appreciate it for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028945974161410))<br />
My point was we get a lot of testing by heroic raiders. It's harder for normal raiders to justify spending the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028822175064064))<br />
<br />
It would have to be a sizable reward to get me to leave my guild groups for the thankless world of pug tanking.<br />
We really don't want you to do that. I fundamentally believe WoW is more fun with friends than solo. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701285473480704))<br />
Hard to believe that, when raid tuning means either settle for LFR or ditch underperforming friends.<br />
Would you be satisfied if you could run Raid Finder with just your friends? Or is your expectation to run an easier ver of normal? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325032623074320385))<br />
<br />
What if..... you didn't change the ilvl or stats on LFR gear ,but made the gear blue quality.<br />
A whole lot of players use LFR. We want to preserve the prestige of N and H raiding, but don't want to push folks out of LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325029986446749696))<br />
<br />
in ToT almost every encounter has a tank swap based on a debuff stack, are we gonna see different mechanics in the next tier?<br />
If we can come up with good ones. We (and tanks) soured on the &quot;soak up the cleave&quot; mechanic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325028256287969280))<br />
<br />
I get bored whenever I feel I can't progress, be it gear or stuck on a boss or whatnot.<br />
Frustration at lack of progression is a common problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325004829191720960))<br />
However, it happens when players can't kill a boss and also when they kill everything and run out of content. No progress. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325004939623550977))<br />
<br />
Actually you can force. Called remove LFG/LFR and you'll see 'communities/interaction' occur instantly.<br />
Er, for some players, sure. Others just log off when they can't get a group. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324707938612686848))<br />
I had friends and still sat in chat for 2h looking for Arcatraz pugs. Not the best of times. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324708030291783681))<br />
<br />
why is mob tagging still in the game? surely fostering co-operation is a good thing?<br />
It is, but tabbing SW:Pain on every mob in a zone isn't our idea of cooperation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326448031295733761))<br />
<br />
GC, will we ever see a return to the way VPs were awarded thru heroics in WotLK? Some people can't log in every day!<br />
You can keep running dungeons on the days you can log in. You keep getting valor beyond the first run. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327957409437986817))<br />
In the DS model, 7 runs capped you. Now, takes 18 runs if you do 1 per day, and 1 more run per missed day.<br />
Fewer players capped when it was 7 a day. Totally understand that that model worked better for some players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328226842635018240))<br />
<br />
What is your design for PvE set bonuses? Stronger as tiers progress? Or just fun bonuses, should people have 4pc or offpieces?<br />
I personally like the idea that off pieces can be competitive, but it's a hard sell to many players (and some designers). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327878152779083776))<br />
I know that for throne of thunder with thunderforged pieces alot of people will be dropping tier pieces for BiS thunderforged.<br />
I think that's kind of cool rather than tunneling in on set pieces only, but we'll see how it feels in a few more weeks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327882061979480064))<br />
Why do we even have off-set pieces? So that armor looks different? But all offset match set artistically anyway.<br />
One reason is players like to match their gear (easier with transmog now). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328225418945650688))<br />
Another is that raid quality armor takes about a month for an artist to make and we make 22 (including PvP) plus weapons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328225711930372096))<br />
<br />
Challenge mode was the biggest waste of resources, unpopular, unappealing, not worth it. Scrap it.<br />
Disagree. It's more popular than expected and I personally find it a ton of fun. It's cool to use all your abilities for a change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327876034403893248))<br />

Exodus Done With 25 Man Raiding<br />
Late last week Killars posted an interesting message (https://www.facebook.com/Killarslol/posts/572309812789070) as to why Exodus (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/mal-ganis/Exodus) is done raiding. They ended up in 8th place in Tier 15, down from 6th place in Tier 14. <br />
<br />
Yes, I'll confirm the news here for anyone not in the loop or questioning the rumors. &lt;Exodus&gt; will no longer continue to function as a 25 man raiding guild. No plan to go 10 man as of yet, but that really doesn't matter because 25 man is what the hardcore raiding scene really is about and Exodus will no longer be competing in such a scene.<br />
<br />
Why? How? Well this game isn't to blame. In the last few years this game (despite many people quitting and guilds dying) isn't to blame for vodka/Exodus' demise it's the raiding community. I don't mean this is a pointing the finger sort of way, it's an inevitable sort of flaw in the competition of the top end raiders. You see... we've basically been killing ourselves off slowly since day 1. <br />
<br />
In the last few years we've certainly picked up the pace, but the &quot;hardcore raider&quot; is a dying breed and it's certainly becoming a more difficult breed to be a part of. What I mean by this is of course the time commitment and the level of shear dedication and determination it takes and costs to be at the very top. This isn't to poke fun, but to just shed light of why many people, and subsequently, many guilds will fall. Raiding for many many hours on end is fun, CAN be exciting, and at the end of it all can really prove who really wants that world first/us first/realm first the most. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately we (hardcore raiders) pushed too hard. Tier after tier we just keep adding to the insanity in both farming preparations and actual progressing. It's almost as if progression itself never really ends after a end tier boss dies. Combine this with Blizzard actually putting new content out faster, alts playing a big role, PTR/BETA, dailys, coins, BMAH, well... you just get lost in it all. Right now there are a few legit world first guilds left. The competition is slim because the competition is literally eating each other (well not that literally). Good luck to everyone left in the race for this expac, but I don't know how much longer this sort of thing can last.<br />

I couldn't agree more. - And the added amount of time you use on alts is also insane but hay we wanted more to do when we're not raiding and we got it. The time consumption is just exploded in MoP for my part which also have lead med to almost quit the game now. Just can't put in all the hours needed to be competitive.</div></div><hr />

It is interesting. It reminds me of people complaining about &quot;having&quot; to do LFR to keep up. Blizzard is right, you can always make the choice not to, but that knowledge that other people will go that far means you know it will keep you behind. Competitive raiders, as he says, dig their own grave in that sense. Some sort of organised amnesty between raiders would work (about what's an acceptable amount of effort), but it just takes one guild to jump the fence and throw it all out the window. It's a bit like steroids in sport, heh.<br />
<br />
Actually it reminds me of the dispute about unpaid overtime at my work at the moment. If one person is willing to work extra for free, in an effort to impress the right people, then everyone has to in an effort to keep up. The funny thing is no one actually wants to, but an arms race begins that drives everyone to do what they don't even want to do.</div></div><hr />

I barely recognize the top 20 anymore. It was bound to happen eventually, I burned out on a way less hardcore schedule (6 years of US top 50/world top 200-300) and while I blame Cataclysm somewhat for hastening the burnout because I disliked 90% of it, even if it had been great at most I think I would have played one more expansion because that kind of schedule conflicted with my long term life goals, and I imagine it's even more of a conflict for the most hardcore. It was always a fun race to watch, and it's too bad. It was easy to blame Cataclysm when I was playing it and hating it, but I see now it would happen no matter how great the game is/isn't, I think. A lot of people are older now and are married, with kids, or just more demanding jobs, other interests, etc. And i don't see enough new players interested in that kind of play style joining to replace them. I wouldn't be surprised if there's really no more hardcore world first race if the game is still around after a couple more expansions.</div></div><hr />

It is a dying breed... Recruitment at that level is becoming harder and harder, the amount of guilds that have a real chance at top 3 is now pretty much 3 guilds and all of them have complained that getting in new recruits is becoming harder.<br />

He didn't suggest it will collapse into uniform casualness, just that the amount of top raiding guilds will collapse to smaller and smaller numbers - which it is.</div></div><hr />

Talents doesn't make sense at all. You know, when I'm playing my alts of all classes and specs, I'm binding similar abilities to the same buttons. So when I switch to other alt with different class and spec, I don't even feel any difference - I just hit the same buttons intuitively. So it's so much hypocritical to tell me, that some simple convenience-oriented change will hurt the game somehow, when it's already hurt 100500 times more by other very doubtful changes.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason to assume that the hardcore raider is a dying breed and that it will all eventually collapse into one big massive uniform heap of casualness and LFR enjoyment. They are quitting because they can no longer attract the talent necessary to compete for a top 5 spot, and that is simply because the amount of dedicated top tier raiding guilds has increased due to the increased popularity of certain top guilds, the almost celebrity cultus that has come with the streaming phenomenon, the addition of high profile sponsorship deals and the exposure the cream of the crop is getting from both the player base and WoW media.<br />
<br />
A least quit in style instead of predicting the apocalypse of hardcore raiding.<br />
<br />
I agree with you to some extent, but I doubt it has to do with attracting talent. If the core membership wants to stop, the guild disbands typically and that sounds like what is happening here.<br />
<br />
They're also right that you essentially have to have no life to raid as a top 10 guild (no, I'm not talking about people who sit on the bench and attend half the time compared to others). However, I don't really think this has ever changed. In Vanilla, it was farming mats for hours. In Mists, it is alts, alt raids, playing the AH to get gold for BMAH gear, etc.</div></div><hr />

I got about halfway through Naxx at 60 and I never remember having to spend the kind of time I did in WotLK with 4 versions of the same raid and Cata with spamming LFR in guild groups just to keep the rank we had. I stopped last summer so I have no idea what it's like in MoP.

In the end, while I think certain game design decisions hastened burnout, it would have happened eventually.

Yeah buuhuu, 50 coins a week takes so looong... With the time they put into progression coins shouldnt really be much of a problem, and to add to that, when the race for T14 ended and the tops guys had all the gear they wanted, they could just save up their Lesser coins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldn't agree more. His assertion is basically tri-spec will allow you to be every spec, thus spec doesn't matter. So untrue. There are only two viable raiding specs for rogues right now, and we have dual specs. What GC describes about everyone being the same should have already happened for rogues, but obviously, it hasn't. There are still people who are &quot;combat rogues&quot; and people who are &quot;mutilate rogues&quot;. It's close to impossible to play both at optimal efficiency for, god, tons of reasons! People will always have to pick a &quot;main spec&quot; regardless of how many specs are allowed, and tri-spec does not endanger that principle. If anything, gear and weapon homogenization does.</div></div><hr />

It is interesting that solo repetitive content grinds used to be considered a hard core activity mostly devoted to the no-lifers and Blizzard had cut down the mindless repetitive solo grinds over the expansions with Cata having the shortest grinds. What made this activity that used to be for the no-lifer hard cores into something for the &quot;casuals&quot;?<br />
<br />
If hardcore raiders finding the grind to be too much, then perhaps the reality is that hardcore raiders are not as hardcore as both Blizzard and the community make them out to be and they have lives despite all the blind hatred that many &quot;casuals&quot; preach. From my view point MoP was designed to deal with the players who complained about there being nothing to do in Cata and having a lot of free time. Those with lives got the sort end of the stick while the real no-lifers who hide behind the name of &quot;casuals&quot; are happy.</div></div><hr />

It has always been that way, as Simca mentioned. It might not have been dailies back then, but farming materials for certain mandatory Fire/Shadow res gear/potions/flasks/etc, let alone farming every possible raid/dungeon/MC trash available to gear up 40 people for months in a row.<br />
I now raid more than I did in Vanilla, except for a short stint during AQ40, and I have a lot more time to do as I please than I had back then, even though time is way scarcer now that I'm older. Raiding in Vanilla at a high level required you to do a lot more outside of raid hours than now. Burning Crusade was no different either.<br />
<br />
Top-tier guilds come and go as hardcore raiders come and go. For every Exodus/vodka that quits, there's another one that rises to the challenge. This scene, this progression race, isn't going to implode upon itself anytime soon. These guys need to get over themselves real fast.</div></div><hr />

It's not somethign I am asking for and it won't hurt my feelings if it never happens. but it's something others want and I can't honestly come up with any negatives toward it at this point. The classes are very similar now. And the new talent system makes the specs more similar as well. But the line &quot;We added talents in vanilla so rogue 1 and rogue 2 can be different&quot; seems very different from how it is now. There isn't much difference at all between specs for some classes. And the line &quot;With tri-spec, what if every rogue feels the same again?&quot; Again? As in... currently? Perhaps using the rogue class is a bad example. What about warriors that want to pvp? They'd benefit. Hell, any tank class would. Any healing class would. The only classes that might not benefit from tri-spec are the pure damage classes. And I'm not even sure which ones might or might not. But it's bad that I can say this much positive about tri-spec given how much I actually worry about it being in-game or not. (And my Main is a Warrior.)<br />

What's diff between reason Blizz used 4 shared lock-out vs. normal raiders feel complld to do normal+LFR each week?<br />
Why do you run LFR as a N raider? What is there for you? (Source)<br />
Valor Points. At our current progression we are still scrapping for any source of upgrade. Plus the SP-A rep to buy.<br />
You won't get additional rep for doubling up, but if you are on e.g. 3rd boss in N then it might make sense to do the rest in LFR. (Source)<br />
To be fair, that's fairly min-max behavior. If you're on 3rd boss on N, a couple more valor pieces isn't what's holding you back. (Source)<br />
Normal Raiders feel the LFR mandatory cus of the stuff. LFR ToT stuff ilvl should be = to 489 to prevent that.<br />
If you're a N raider, you are earning 522+ ilevel. (Source)<br />
If you don't have much 522 because you're stuck on an early boss, then getting a few 502 probably isn't what's blocking you. (Source)<br />
If you like earning ilevel as fast as possible, by all means go for it, but I wouldn't consider it mandatory. (Source)<br />
<br />
And this part... I'm not even sure. It's as if the Blizzard poster doesn't understand why normal raiders would run LFR... But then it's obvious he does. (If it's the same poster, I didn't click the source) Some peopel just have crappy luck. LFR can possibly fill a needed slot. Same as Valor Items. Which are FOR filling in needed slots. I don't understand what the Blizzard poster is getting at here.</div></div><hr />

Tank specs are actually often much more efficient at doing dailies because you can mass pull everything with no downtime. If you stick to 1v1 mobs as Prot, then yeah it's slower. But that's also your fault.</div></div><hr />

I play prot pally as my main, for years. My OS has been holy since second spec became an option. Now, with Mists I find that things need more damage to take down. Sure, I do pull large packs and still do, and slowly dps them down.<br />
<br />
However, things like the trove runs, and Brawler's guild, especially Brawler's guild, requires a lot of dps. Doing Brawler's guild as a prot is just wasting yours and others time. Sure you can get through certain bosses in there with prot, but it's not possible for them all.<br />
<br />
Having the ability to have all three specs, and not waste my game time on going to a trainer, adding buttons back on the toolbars, etc, would be nice. Either way, it's possible to do it, so just making it so it's not a hassle isn't going to break the game. If it were, the time I take to do it would wreck the game. It's all about not wasting time on silly little things, so I and others can enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />

It could be argued that characters feel less unique if they all have the three specs accessible at once.<br />
Plus, a respec takes seconds to do(you can't complain about setting up bars, that's is your fault for not using an actionbar saver), so there's not much to complain about. And I did brawler's guild as a Blood DK and didn't have much trouble at all.</div></div><hr />

Plus, a respec takes seconds to do(you can't complain about setting up bars, that's is your fault for not using an actionbar saver), so there's not much to complain about. And I did brawler's guild as a Blood DK and didn't have much trouble at all.<br />
<br />
DK being the key word there. Ghoul, bat, army of dead. Things other tanks don't have.<br />
<br />
Not eveybody wants to run a ton of addons.<br />
<br />
Having a third spec fixes this and my previous statement.<br />
<br />
What is unique? If I can change my spec at a trainer at any time, it' not unique. If I could only choose two specs from the moment I make my character, and never have the ability to ever change them no matter what, would probably make it a bit more unique. However, I and others can, so in the end we can have that spec or any spec possible to that toon. Once again, this just saves us time, and not having to have an addon to save bar layouts.<br />
<br />
We are able to have the gear for the three specs, we can re-spec at the trainer, it wastes time and is a hassle, so having a third would be great.</div></div><hr />

I have been realy hardcore some time back but i felt generally the same as the exodus guy.... the commitment level is not compatible anymore with todays' extremely competitive society in &quot;RL&quot;. It almoust feels like RL is so hard outside that we don't have the energy anymore to be so serious in yet another thing in this turn a computer game.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me the only way to go in Gamming atm is casual play being it in wow or any other game realy. The problem in wow is that casual content is atm extremely boring, easy, repetitive and I absolutely hate dailies wich seems to be the core of casual content atm in this game.<br />
<br />
- 5 mens died<br />
- dailies are boring as hell to me<br />
- LFR takes ages and its realy realy easy<br />
- Normal content guilds are dying out in most servers, 25 men normal guilds are rare as hell<br />
- Scenarios feel to me as dumbed downed content<br />
<br />
I honestly most of the time don't feel like logging because there is not a thing that calls me to the game when i'm deciding what to do in an evening free. I can honestly say most of the time i have to kill time i rather watch youtube videos than log into wow.<br />
<br />
<br />
This game is for me dead. Hardcore is not compatible anymore with my life, casual is extremely boring and too easy atm, there is not much where to run except level another alt, wich i'm already burned out aswell.... So yeah, last month recurring subscription i'm afraid :\ if it would be free from subs i could reconsider but i cant justify spending money each month to play 1 hour a week...<br />
<br />
Real sad, i realy loved this game, lore, gameplay, etc for over 9 years. Time to let it go with fond memories.</div></div><hr />

My OS has been holy since second spec became an option. Now, with Mists I find that things need more damage to take down. Sure, I do pull large packs and still do, and slowly dps them down.<br />
<br />
However, things like the trove runs, and Brawler's guild, especially Brawler's guild, requires a lot of dps. Doing Brawler's guild as a prot is just wasting yours and others time. Sure you can get through certain bosses in there with prot, but it's not possible for them all.<br />
<br />
Having the ability to have all three specs, and not waste my game time on going to a trainer, adding buttons back on the toolbars, etc, would be nice. Either way, it's possible to do it, so just making it so it's not a hassle isn't going to break the game. If it were, the time I take to do it would wreck the game. It's all about not wasting time on silly little things, so I and others can enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
What's the point in having specs then?<br />
<br />
The point is you have to decide which type of paladin you want to play. Tank, healer or DPS. If you can have all 3, then there's no point in spec'ing at all. Then they might as well do away with specs all together and just transform all specializations into a stance bar, and give all skills currently in the talent tree free of charge (maybe some could only be used in a specific 'Spec'). But then we're back at square one again, everyone has exactly the same spec (albeit that may already be the case, still though, hypothetically, you can spec however you want), and there's no telling apart the same classes - which is what GC is referring to.</div></div><hr />

Can you change specs in combat? Can you change all your gear associated with the specs in combat? No. There is no reason not to implement tri-spec whatsoever. I can get the exact same thing you are mentioning by going to the trainer to change specs. All tri-spec does is make it easier and more convenient. GC is referring to rogues complaining there was no real differences between the playstyles of the 3 specs, which has absolutely nothing to do with tri-spec, it has to do with Blizzard taking away certain specs uniqueness and making them baseline/talents so the specs ended up playing the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know plenty of pure dps who want tri-spec. Back when my main was a rogue, I wanted tri-spec. I raided and pvped. During wrath(ICC) assassination was best for single target fights with little to no movement while combat was better for high movement fights. Then for pvp you needed a different spec. And last tier you needed a combat spec for cleave fights or you were gimping your raid, but combat didn't do well in non-cleave fights.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason to assume that the hardcore raider is a dying breed and that it will all eventually collapse into one big massive uniform heap of casualness and LFR enjoyment. They are quitting because they can no longer attract the talent necessary to compete for a top 5 spot, and that is simply because the amount of dedicated top tier raiding guilds has increased due to the increased popularity of certain top guilds, the almost celebrity cultus that has come with the streaming phenomenon, the addition of high profile sponsorship deals and the exposure the cream of the crop is getting from both the player base and WoW media.<br />
<br />
A least quit in style instead of predicting the apocalypse of hardcore raiding.<br />
<br />
You're really off base on this one.<br />
<br />
They're not saying hardcore raiding is dying off and will collapse into the casualness and LFR and its membership. Rather the time commitment is prohibitive. Guess what, they're right.<br />
<br />
Pretty much with the continued alt unfriendliness of MoP, dailies, farm management, rep grinding, capping valor/conquest etc. What does that leave them time to do? When do they get to enjoy the game?<br />
<br />
For hardcore gaming top 5 25 man guilds capable of pushing world firsts WoW is their life. Not just professionally speaking but literally. They push 16-18 hour days doing world firsts. I've done 16-18 hour days on WoW after an objective by day 3 you are mentally exhausted, you cannot sleep, you cannot stay awake physiologically you're a mess. Emotionally you've shut off everything around you. It is completely unhealthy. At the start of a patch they're doing this for 1-3 weeks depending on raid difficulty. Honestly, I don't know how they do it.<br />
<br />
So these guilds are cannibalizing each other or eating each other alive because if you lose 1-3 people per patch that just can't do what I described anymore your team will fall apart faster than you can replace it. The members that want to continue start looking for a more &quot;solid&quot; guild.<br />
<br />
It is the exact same dynamic that happens with raiding guilds on any server since raiding started. <br />
<br />
If you think there is a celebrity cult with streaming and the sponsorships that go with those guilds you are correct. That is why guilds on the cusp of top 5 status are folding because their most dedicated players want that status and leave, the people there for the group end up having to throw in the towel on 25 man raiding because the challenges of keeping up the pace become increasingly difficult.<br />
<br />
There is not a net increase in top tier raiding guilds. The number is consistently decreasing on nearly every server. You're just seeing new names at the top of the world first lists and think it's reflective of an increase in top tier raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />

The time consumption is just exploded in MoP for my part which also have lead med to almost quit the game now. Just can't put in all the hours needed to be competitive.<br />
<br />
But this has been what most of us having been saying since vanilla. Hardcore raiding was never ´hard´.. it was all about sacrificing your normal life to play a game like an addict. I remember a RL friend from vanilla who raided. I was simply floored when he told me he ´scheduled´ 12 hours of his life to raid. When you think of it, it is crazy to schedule your real life around that.<br />
<br />
Now you look at world-first. The ´winners´ this time said they raided 12-14 hours PER DAY.. for weeks.<br />
<br />
I look at myself, and I don´t raid because I could never imagine telling anyone in my real life that I can´t do something on thursday night because from 8-12pm I need to raid in a video game. Can you imagine what those ´winners´ had to tell their families for those 3 weeks?<br />
<br />
Exodus sounds like things turned against them.. but the fact is... they just finally grew up and realized how stupid it is to dedicate so much of your life and plans to schedule to play a game. What he said in that post is exactly what ´casual´ players have been saying since vanilla. Nothing has changed, just his perception.</div></div><hr />

You know that in world of warcraft (maybe you are speaking about another game), dps also do AOEing for dailies right ?<br />
<br />
If you are slower than a tank at doing them something is REALLY wrong.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">markdall</div><div class="date">2013-05-01, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This anti-triple spec argument of theirs is garbage. I play a hunter. I raid. I'm constantly switching talents and glyphs around in both specs - one way for soloing/dungeons/scenarios/dailies, and another way for raiding where I'm backed up by healers and there's no need for me to sneak past things etc. Triple spec would alleviate that - a little. <br />
<br />
The biggest benefit to me for more specs is the saving of my action bars. Yes, there are addons to do that but they are flakey and seem to break often, likely due to changes made by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
So... the tweet was something along the lines of &quot;this would make rogues all be the same&quot;. What? How? How is two specs different from three? Hell I could use 4 - no, 5 - just from what I said above: SV non-raid, SV raid, BM non-raid, BM raid, PVP. As it is I'll switch talents and glyphs around to meet my needs anyway. The difference is that I have I to f around with my action bars each time and it's a pain in the ass. How does adding the convenience of a third spec make me suddenly identical to other hunters? (I have a rogue too, same argument.)<br />
<br />
What about hybrids, though? Paladins would have one spec for each role. OH GOD THE HORROR...? I guess if nothing else that would make them a little stronger of a character to bring to raids for the added flexibility - monks, paladins, druids. So I could see Blizzard arguing that. But they don't. They're just worried that somehow - god forbid - two rogues are the same. <br />
<br />
It must be a PVP thing. That's got to be it. PVP considerations seem to ruin PVE play on a regular basis. I'll just assume that it's doing it again.</div></div><hr />

Not yet. Give it some time though. I'm sure someone will ask for it sooner or later.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
People wanted dual specs in the past, now tri-specs. Soon it will be Quad Specs, Penta Specs etc. Then, when we have all the combinations we could think of ever needing, we want it to be even easier to switch between them, even in combat, because of some arbitrary reason, maybe a boss fight requires 3 tanks in phase 1, but only 1 in phase 2; &quot;Would be nice to switch to DPS in combat, else I'm useless half the fight!&quot;.<br />
<br />
See where I'm going? It never ends until you have all the possibilities at the click of a button, and without moving an inch.<br />
<br />
You might be able to get the same thing by visiting a trainer, however, once there, you have to choose which is good thing in my opinion. Let there at least be something left that requires you to move somewhere.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact:<br />
<br />
<br />
... Hell I could use 4 - no, 5 - just from what I said above: SV non-raid, SV raid, BM non-raid, BM raid, PVP....<br />
<br />
See? Didn't take long :D<br />
<br />
Learn to live with the fact that you have to choose sometimes. Else, what's next? We get to have all Primary Proffs as well? Sure would be nice. Never have to pay obscure amounts of gold for craftable things like gems, enchants etc.</div></div><hr />

'Real life' is a term I tend to hear a lot and its such an oxymoronic term. Your life is your life, and that is all there is to it. <br />
<br />
Raiding that hardcore would never be for me, but I wouldn't sneer at them just because they found something they are so passionate about. I happen to raid 12 hours a week, and to me that's a perfect balancing act that I can schedule. I have plenty of time to be social, finish up all my studying and coursework, as well as hold a part time job. I also enjoy playing with the people whom are in my guild, sometimes more-so than the people I see everyday.<br />
<br />
Anyways, what you seem to fail to realize is that there really is no room for that many guilds at the top to be competing that kind of level. It has less to do with having a commitment than it is to do with finding a replacement with that kind of commitment. If you take the whole raiding population, maybe 200 of them have the skill, commitment, and time to be able to play at that kind of level. They are already all taken, so when a top guild loses someone it is almost impossible for them to get a replacement. Top guilds cannibalize one another and eventually the weaker ones will die out.</div></div><hr />

Tank DPS is fairly balanced at the moment, with paladins actually having higher tank dps than DKs because they can reforge and gem for haste in their tank builds while DKs have to go for mastery.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
People wanted dual specs in the past, now tri-specs. Soon it will be Quad Specs, Penta Specs etc. Then, when we have all the combinations we could think of ever needing, we want it to be even easier to switch between them, even in combat, because of some arbitrary reason, maybe a boss fight requires 3 tanks in phase 1, but only 1 in phase 2; &quot;Would be nice to switch to DPS in combat, else I'm useless half the fight!&quot;.<br />
<br />
See where I'm going? It never ends until you have all the possibilities at the click of a button, and without moving an inch.<br />
<br />
You might be able to get the same thing by visiting a trainer, however, once there, you have to choose which is good thing in my opinion. Let there at least be something left that requires you to move somewhere.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact:<br />
<br />
<br />
See? Didn't take long :D<br />
<br />
Learn to live with the fact that you have to choose sometimes. Else, what's next? We get to have all Primary Proffs as well? Sure would be nice. Never have to pay obscure amounts of gold for craftable things like gems, enchants etc.<br />
<br />
But that's just it, there's not a choice as it is now. If you want to change specs you can do it already and quite easily. Tri spec would just add convenience and that's what people keep saying. Speccing is not a hard choice and never really has been except maybe in vanilla where 50 gold was still a decent amount of gold. People respec trees and talents even now on a per fight basis if they want to, again, the reason they want tri spec is for convenience. Talent trees are not about choices other than if you want to go through the hassle of visiting a trainer, rearranging your bars, and using a trivial amount of gold. That's it.<br />
<br />
Also, people have wanted multiple specs forever, it wasn't just let us have 2. You're trying to make it into some kind of slippery slope argument that I just don't see when it comes to respeccing mid fight, all buffs, every profession etc (which btw, many people do have every profession already through alts more or less). As far as additional specs beyond 3, I personally don't see much need but I wouldn't be against it at all for reasons already stated.</div></div><hr />

The statement posted is just an overall explanation, there's a hundred more reasons for why the guild's progression is falling apart---not necessarily reasons worth sharing with the rest of the internet.<br />
<br />
A popular guild falling apart doesn't mean the game is in decline or some other interpreted &quot;truth&quot;, everything that has a beginning has an end---new guilds will rise to take the spotlight.<br />
<br />
That said, I personally agree with that the &quot;cycle&quot; seems never-ending. It was fun in Classic to advance through the content, it was still exciting to progress in BC and explorer the world further, it became less interesting in WotLK when they started throwing in apparent filler content like TotC and it because really dull in Cata with DS. MoP raiding to me became more about the mechanics than exploration or the story (did you really care about facing the Sha of Fear as to say, a lore figure like Kel'thuzard/Vashj?) and the new raiding tier hasn't even made me resubscribe yet (just because I truly do not give a damn about the new generic monster &quot;Mogu&quot; race, their background story and active plots are just dull in my opinion).<br />
<br />
I might resubscribe for the whole raid on Orgrimmar content patch if they actually intend to do that, because that would actually feel like a Warcraft game's story (which we've had next to nothing of in MoP, despite all the promises).</div></div><hr />

You think that just because you enjoy PvP it's the only way to play the game, I've seen so many hardcore PvPers that go on about how bad PvE Heroes are and then completely fail themselves in raids not only on mechanics but on overall dps output as well. Most pvpers don't know shit about the game outside their PvP rotation and because of that they fail in raids. This is also the reason they seem to avoid raids, It's not actually because you guys think it's easy, it's because you guys don't want to be caught out by others as being completely terrible outside pvp.<br />

Also just wanted to point out 'Yous' is not a word, the correct usage in your sentence is &quot;game and you still(*) fucking whine&quot;.

<br />
Hardcore PvPers are good at reactions, much less so in regards to situational awareness and coordination with 24 other people. A lot of the ones that I played with actually had a tendency to zone out during &quot;easier&quot; phases in fights then die when it ramped up. Not all of them are this way of course, some are just overall good players. By good players though, I really just mean have the ability to focus and possess game knowledge. Those are the only real requirements to playing this game well imo.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sad to hear about Exodus, but knew it was going to happen. It is WAAAAY too hardcore now. It used to be that you would just have a main raid once a week. Once you finished it with your hardcore push for world first, it became a gentle 4 hour raid week with a lot of free time. Now you have like 4 sets of alts with gear so that you can gear main raiders up super quickly and it is a neverending process of farming gear, gold, and other nonsense. I think that Algalon is the first boss that introduced the idea of using alts, though I dunno when they extended the alt process to every tier. It is beyond ridiculous at this point though.</div></div><hr />

They are right, eventually it will happen maybe not any time soon but one day those top guilds WILL die out, and as you put it &quot;will all eventually collapse into one big massive uniform heap of casualness and LFR enjoyment&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound weird but True, but also remember blizz knows that just 25% of the end population actually raid, so while this hardcore guild decide to call it quits as soon as more hardcore guild quits also maybe there will be no need to keep releasing a new raid every other patch...<br />
<br />
Im wishing the day 10man become the standard and you have 5man raid...<br />

The first time I recall the alt issue coming up was M'uru. We needed another heroism and ended up getting an alt one decently geared up somehow but it was a pain. We contemplated an alt warlock but those of us who could press buttons because we had a warlock alt in the end took turns playing the warlock char whose owner had RL issues. I don't remember our rank at the time and it wasn't even that great, US 50 ish? Maybe higher ranked guilds just had enough of each class to never consider it before WotLK.</div></div><hr />

That isnt the alt issue that I am speaking of. Most people have an alt or two that is pretty reasonably geared. I myself had alts that were brought into raids when necessary, as did other people. This was optional and not everybody had one. You also didnt run raids with like 8 main heroes and 17 alts to gear up all of the mains at the beginning of each tier.<br />
<br />
Also, most top guilds had extra actual people sitting and waiting for a spot or when they are needed. So you would have 25 in the raid and an extra 5-10 people of various classes waiting to get in just sitting on the bench. Our guild was only top on the server (MAYBE top 250 in the US apart from minor breakout performances) and we werent particularly hardcore but we still had people on the bench all the time.</div></div><hr />

Oh I agree it definitely got way, way worse until we got the ridiculousness it is now. We had a bench but I imagine a top guild would have had to have a really large bench to be able to class stack before alts could be geared the way they can now. (I also imagine maintaining that bench has gotten much harder)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most top guilds had enough to run 2 full raid groups, one being the &quot;best of the best&quot; and the others being the filler players. At some point between then and now they decided that it was best to just have one really good raid group so that they dont have to teach people the fight when they come in. I am fairly certain that the Algalon push is what made alt raids much more prominent.</div></div><hr />

LFR wipes in the transition phases, where you can't target Lei Shen, so health is irrellevant.. Nerfing his health, only helps you get to transition phase a bit faster, and thus wipe faster..<br />
<br />
If anything should be nerfed, it should be the length of transition phase: Shorter transition = less screwups by players = less risk of wipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point is adding tri-spec would make the game a little bit more boring.<br />
<br />
There's a ton of inconvenient things still left in the game, like:<br />
<br />
Is it not inconvenient to have to spend time moving from point A to point B? How about a portal mechanism, where you just double-click a point on your map, and *puf* you're there instantly.<br />
<br />
Removing everything that's inconvenient leaves very little to do. They'd have to remove dailies as well, and just award people gold and random rep once a day. Remove trash in dungeons and raids. Who cares about trash anyway. Just add whatever they might drop to the boss loot table and up the gold drop as well. And so on...<br />
<br />
<br />
You're trying to make it into some kind of slippery slope argument that I just don't see when it comes to respeccing mid fight, all buffs, every profession etc (which btw, many people do have every profession already through alts more or less). As far as additional specs beyond 3, I personally don't see much need but I wouldn't be against it at all for reasons already stated.<br />
<br />
Today it's tri-specs for talents, tomorrow it's dual-spec for proffs. Have 2 active, and be able to swap to two others. You can have them all spread across multiple toons, but it would be so much more convenient to have them all on the same toon, no?<br />
<br />
It never ends. You could change so many things to make it more convenient, just, that tends to make things a lot more boring, 'cos there's fewer things to do, which means there's not much else than raiding and farming dailies (which it seems a lot of people already hate - the dailies).<br />
<br />
PS. Pardon me if I come off as a bit too sarcastic or arrogant or whatever. It's not intended, just trying to prove my point :)</div></div><hr />

ive cleared all 10 man raids in MOP apart from TOT and i can tell you there isnt hardly any PVE rotation anymore all you gotta do is make sure you dnt stand in any bosses moves or generate more threat than your tank, i dnt know why ppl say PVE rotation exists how tall i do as a dk is spam HB,FS and OB to proc a free rime, you can play 10 man raids 1 handed ive done raiding whilst eating a fucking pizza before, PVP requires alot more than PVE does nowadays, everything in PVE is pretty much given to you bosses moves are in the journal,DBM addon tells you when boss is gonna do a certain move etc.<br />
<br />
PVE = scripted content thats gotten easier over the years<br />
