Timewarped 2H Caster Weapon Hotfix<br />
It appears that the Timewarped 2H Weapon spellpower hotfix has come undone with 6.2.2a, as the spellpower on these weapons was reduced again today. <br />
Timewalking 2-handed caster weapons now have bonus Spell Power equal to that of 1-handed caster weapons. <br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 6.2.2a Notes<br />
Bug Fixes<br />

Fixed an issue that caused some Archaeology dig sites to take on an odd shape and prevented them from being completed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Like how the emerald drake made sense? If it's via achievement, it really doesn't need any context.<br />
.I'd argue that while this is true, it's so cool and iconic that efforts should be made to make it fit a story/event. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/641648296402878464))<br />
Makes perfect sense for a TIMEWALKING mount. Complete all time walking dungeons or something.<br />
TW is a good vehicle, but I think you could do more, eg hidden infinite rares in TW dung's up to no good. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/641650352052244480))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jasper Kazai</div><div class="date">2015-09-16, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I leveled archaeology and even farmed it enough to get some of the rares like the ghostwolf pup and the BoA 2h mace. Now that I've gone back and done it with flying, I can't fathom doing it again on the ground. But I know I probably will end up doing so at least a little in Legion... Also, 5 years later and I'm still grinding to get that goddamn Qiraji mount. Grinded the shit out of it in Cata, and every single crate turn-in I have done in MoP and WoD have been for Tol'vir, and still no sight of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apexis</div><div class="date">2015-09-16, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not think the pole on Archaeology is all that cut an dry. While I did wait until after flying was implemented to bother to even good get the scroll from completing a dig site. Flying in and of itself does not make so that I want to actual spend the time leveling Archaeology to 700. While flying makes Archaeology far more tolerable to want to do. Archaeology itself is just boring and offers very little for the time spent doing it. <br />
<br />
I will eventually get around to finishing leveling to 700, but its not something that is high on the priority list currently. I never really completed all the various achievements for MoP to get the Seeker of Knowledge title. There is no such meta for WoD, and just having the various piece in the garrison is not all that necessary that I want to bother to fly around and farm them out.<br />
<br />
Archaeology is one of those things that I do when I have little of nothing else to do to past my time between queues and such. I have not been queuing for much of anything for awhile now, so I am less inclined to want to do Archaeology at this point. I would rather spend the time farming mounts, pets, and transmog on all my characters weekly, because that is now the part of the game that most interest me. I farm constantly on all 15 of my current level 100's and I am about to add another 3 or 4 to that list, just as soon as I finish leveling them over the next few weeks. Outside of the slot machine missions for gold from both the garrison and shipyard, I spend little time in current content. I have yet to bother to step into HFC, because most of my characters are gear enough from farming bafeful gear out the first few weeks of the current patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archibalde</div><div class="date">2015-09-16, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The archaeology poll options are a bit lacking. I did a significant amount of progress before getting flying, but I did most of it through the garrison. I only went chasing after digsites when I had rare projects and cared enough to finish it quickly, otherwise I took my sweet time. Now that I can fly I'm a lot more interested in getting all the pristine items and filling up the collection room.</div></div><hr />
