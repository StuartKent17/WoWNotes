Patch 4.3: Hurricane and Wrath Animations<br />
Last PTR update http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druids got a new animation for Hurricane. An updated version of Wrath that looks much better than the first preview was also added. See our previous preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2481-Legendary-Daggers-Questline-Mini-Preview-New-Class-Spell-Effects) for the other updates to http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman, and http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock.<br />

Curse Website Redesign<br />
Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/?utm_source=mmoc&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=relaunch) has a fresh new design and even more supported games. In addition to add-ons, Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/?utm_source=mmoc&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=relaunch) offers custom maps, high-quality/exclusive demos, client downloads, and beta key programs. Head over to the new Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/?utm_source=mmoc&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=relaunch) now and try it out! You can let us know what you think on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/CurseNetwork) or Twitter (http://twitter.com/#!/cursenetwork). The updates include:<br />
<br />
<br />
Updated UI - Easier browsing of addons and a cleaner and more modern look.<br />
New Net Bar - Allows you to log in to many Curse sites with just one username and password as well as keeping up to date on beta key giveaways and other contests.<br />
Easier add-on discovery - Easier to find and share add-ons through filters, browsing categories, and addon packs. Addon packs take the hassle out of selection addons for your UI by letting someone else do the work.<br />
More downloads and supported games - Not only WoW, but Rift, Minecraft, Starcraft II, Runes of Magic, Warhammer, and more!<br />
Premium Upgrades - Premium users will benefit from their faster download speeds as file sizes for demos and game clients are much larger than add-ons.<br />
<br />

Tome of Light Buff<br />
We didn’t actually buff Tome of Light per se. It was just twice as good as the tooltip said it was, and since we didn't think that a nerf was in order, we're just correcting the tooltip for 4.3. You guys shouldn't notice a change to Tome of Light.<br />
<br />
You should notice a change to Holy Word: Serenity, though. As you know, that ability hasn't always benefited from the 25% crit bonus that it's supposed to get. It was a little tricky to figure out why that was happening, but we've gotten to the bottom of it. Holy Word: Serenity should be fixed for 4.3, so you should notice a change there. <br />
<br />
[...]Sorry for the confusion! The bug came in an earlier version of 4.3 and was fixed recently in 4.3. Please recall that, while you guys are just getting your first look at it, internally we have been working on 4.3 for a long time.<br />
<br />
However, this fix has introduced another bug. With the priest tier set bonus, the duration of Sanctuary can be longer than its cooldown. This causes a host of technical problems because that spell just isn’t set up right to have multiple copies, nor do we really want Sanctuary to have 100% uptime in the first place. So, we're likely to revert the change to Tome of Light (restoring it back to 15% / 30%) but we'll also lower the base cooldown of Serenity so that it will have a 7 sec cooldown with Tome of Light.<br />
<br />
Note: All of this discussion applies to the 4.3 PTR, where some amount of &quot;design churn&quot; is to be expected; we want to avoid making you to feel like your character is under a barrage of constant changes after a patch goes live.

Guardian Cub: Legal Gold Selling<br />
TCG Loot card mounts like the Spectral Tiger have been BoE for a long time now (since patch 3.2), and that was and continues to be well-received, and as far as we've been able to tell hasn't had any adverse impact to the game or economy - despite them selling for sometimes astronomical amounts of gold.<br />
<br />
It’s potentially worth noting that no new gold is being introduced into the game's economy with those mounts or the new Guardian Cub pet.<br />
<br />
Our goal with the Guardian Cub is to provide alternative ways for players who don't want to spend real money to add these pets to their collection. Even though this has been available a while now with the TCG mounts, this is obviously a new kind of way to deliver Pet Store pets, and we're definitely interested to hear your feedback and ultimately see how this will play out.

<br />
No Orc or Undead Paladins?<br />
[...] We've already incorporated a lot of race/class combos that never existed from the release of the game. I think you could argue we should just make it so every race can be every class at this point, we're pretty much there, and I think you could argue that we should hang on to the few distinctions we have left.<br />
<br />
I'll make one argument, it would be a lot of work to scale/fit each class-specific armor piece to two additional models (male/female) of a new race. Not insurmountable, but it'd be a call we'd really have to evaluate and be prepared to take on that extra work for every set that's produced. Aside from any lore-related explanations we want to keep.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the distinction that only some races can be some classes adds a lot to the game. It makes it feel more real, even if I don't know what the lore reason is.

It seems so simple, yet makes me realize - even though I don't miss Wrath - how Blizzard's team and every other video game team probably has HUNDREDS of awesome things they want to implement EVERY expansion but they don't have the time (or possibly technical resources) to pull it off. <br />

About 15 people I know have gotten some kind of NASTY NASTY virus from Curse.com because they don't monitor their content and, at least before this revamp, Curse.com was never actually a website meant for addons...It was a website for ADVERTISING your lame stuff while also allowing people to post downloadable content. Maybe they finally changed their ways and have made a worthwhile switch to a SAFE and SECURE way of offering addons to WoW players. I still refuse to use the site tho. Not until I see some rock solid confirmations that they don't allow virus-ridden adverts and addons to be uploaded for people to put on their PCs.</div></div><hr />

One in every 5000th or 10000th card? As opposed to unlimited purchases of Guardian Cubs, that always cost the same price when you purchase them from Blizzard but are subject to great inflation when everyone starts spamming them for sale in-game. In a way it's a good thing: fast inflation would deter players from buying the pet and also the effect on in-game economy would be minimal. Great income - but only for Blizzard.Our goal with the Guardian Cub is to provide alternative ways for players who don't want to spend real money to add these pets to their collection.So why not add them in-game as rewards, drops or vendor items?

I've been a boomkin since BC. The only reason people think it's the power of the sun is because of the design of the eclipse mechanic. There is no such thing as &quot;solar&quot; spells. If you look at which spells you can be resistant to, no where in the freaking game does it say you can be resistant to Solar.

While I used a lot more words in my feedback survey. I kinda agree. Even on a wide screen monitor the first half of the website is wasted on huge pictures and not enough useful content. I have to scroll down to see anything worth looking at. I guess if the only reason you go there is for the addons, then it is working because most people probably don't realize there is anything else to see. And yes, I know there are little links to the rest of the content on the menu bar, but most people don't notice those. It's a pretty design, just not that functional. <br />

My webdesign teacher always said, &quot;people are too lazy to scroll down, and if it more than 2 links away you might as well remove it because it won't be seen&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Wrath is Nature damage and Moonfire/Starfire is Arcane damage because of game mechanics. There's no &quot;lunar damage&quot; resistance either. The night elves didn't ban arcane magic usage and force a portion of their population into exile so they could run around spamming Arcane magic spells as moonkin. It would make sense that the counterpart to a blue-tinted lunar power would be an orange-tinted solar power.<br />

<br />
It is still supposed to be a nature spell, just as the Star spells are supposed to be arcane spells representing lunar. So solar is nature and lunar is arcane. I think it is more fitting to the solar theme, though, to have it orange. After all, Sunfire is representative more of its origin than its school. Not that I'm an expert on moonkins, but I see no problem with an orange wrath spell. ;)<br />

Indeed. Blizzard's failed attempt at making their gold selling look proper.<br />
<br />
TCG Loot card mounts like the Spectral Tiger have been BoE for a long time now --- despite them selling for sometimes astronomical amounts of gold.<br />
<br />
How much are there of Spectral Tigers? One in every 5000th or 10000th card? Guardian Cubs always cost the same price when you purchase them from Blizzard but are subject to great inflation when everyone starts spamming them for sale in-game. In a way it's a good thing: fast inflation will deter players from buying the pet, and also the effect on in-game economy will be minimal. Great income - but only for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Our goal with the Guardian Cub is to provide alternative ways for players who don't want to spend real money to add these pets to their collection.<br />
<br />
So why not add them in-game as rewards, drops or vendor items? Yeah, I see why.</div></div><hr />

qft, I think a lot of players would dig this more than shiny t-sets or new spell animations, but on the other hand, we all witnessed the making of new modells when worgen were created, with mixed results (worgen females first designs where better then the current ones, which are plain an eye sore)</div></div><hr />

Boy, the sun is the very embodiment of nature. It powers everything, including the part of nature called life. Without it, there would be no green plants, happy bunnys jumping around in the woods, a horde and an alliance waging war, etc. It makes total sense to have the power of the sun be used to let the enemy feel your wrath, and to tap into the energy of life to heal your allies.<br />
<br />
The improved wrath looks alot better. It's obviously clear that the first itteration was just an underlying part of the whole animation. Hurricane looks a little, I don't know, slow? Let's see what they make of it.</div></div><hr />

Well, hurricane certainly looks more...hurricane-y now but IDK; it seems a bit strange looking still. And LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL about Curse. I read an article recently saying that Curse.com is one of the most dangerous sites frequently visited by MMO gamers. About 15 people I know have gotten some kind of NASTY NASTY virus from Curse.com because they don't monitor their content and, at least before this revamp, Curse.com was never actually a website meant for addons...It was a website for ADVERTISING your lame stuff while also allowing people to post downloadable content. Maybe they finally changed their ways and have made a worthwhile switch to a SAFE and SECURE way of offering addons to WoW players. I still refuse to use the site tho. Not until I see some rock solid confirmations that they don't allow virus-ridden adverts and addons to be uploaded for people to put on their PCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been using curse client since BC and never have gotten a virus or hacked. Maybe your friends shouldn't click on ads or look at porn. Kthx.</div></div><hr />

first it also says that your moonfire turns into sunfire if the energy is full solar eclipse...<br />
<br />
second, who says that nature things can only be green? isnt the sun part of the nature? was it crafted by some people?<br />
<br />
it could also be blue because he is shooting blueberry juice out of his hands &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
nature damage only says that the energy for that cast is received from the nature or that the &quot;material&quot; of the cast is a nature one which has nothing to do with the color.</div></div><hr />

Well, except for fist weapons that would need to be mirrowed, Fury warriors have been able to DW caster Main hand weapons for a long time.

I completely agree. Granted, I think they have been acting shady for a few years now. The whole reason that I liked Blizzard in the first place was because they used to advertise themselves as &quot;A company made up of gamers for gamers.&quot; Its been awhile since we heard anything like that from blizzard. But if you do some digging, things did start changing after the activision merger. And people can say, oh blizzard is independent and activision has no say in their business. That is true to a point, but both companies have the same shareholders now. And those shareholders spent years with the activision model and they will expect the same results from blizzard. Low production costs for large revenue. In the end its politics.</div></div><hr />

Well, caster weapons used to be 1h, but because some ele shamans speccing partially into enha to get dual wield (around 3.0 iirc), they became main hand.

When Gold is easier to obtain, it increases prices. You can see that simply by looking at the price of items between BC, Wrath and now Cataclysm. <br />

His point remains, it's an ignorant way to implement an &quot;alternate way of obtaining the item&quot; when, in reality, it's just a way to pluck more sales.<br />

The new wrath makes me think i'm looking at a new priest spell effect for smite.

Except what you're talking about is gold entering the economy through looting, quests, dungeon finder, etc. That gold pretty much enters the economy from thin air, just as it leaves the economy when people unlearn talents, repair, or buy the traveler's mammoth. The reason for the inflated prices between expansions is that higher level mobs drop more gold and higher level vendor trash and quests reward more gold. In the case of this pet, when you sell it and gain X amount of gold, another player loses X amount of gold to obtain the pet from you. The total amount of gold in the economy hasn't changed, and inflation isn't occurring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More gold was added to the game from BC to now - There weren't any easy to access faramable dailies pre-sunwell, pre-wrath there was no farmable bosses that dropped noticable gold, then come mid Wrath nearly everyone could atleast solo Kara. Inflation was caused due to gold influx. <br />
<br />
These pets however, will only move 10k from me to another player - the ingame gold remains the same. Inflation will continue to happen due to dailies and the remaining farmable raids (Bt and the like), however these pets shouldn't affect the economy. That logic makes sense in my mind atleast.<br />
<br />
-I do however agree on the last point, if they don't change it so that that if you buy it yourself from the store, then it's account wide like the others then I'll be very disappointed.<br />
<br />
*Note, I'm against the pet store in general, I don't like the fact unique pets/mounts only seem to be added through the store, or that I can't get the 150 pet achievement without getting the tol'vir/baradin fox/dragonwrath pet due to me not willing to give them more money for things I believe should be part of the game anyway. However, I don't complain when they add new pets, and I won't be complaining if they switch to this method - purely because it really doesn't affect me.</div></div><hr />

and that blizzard compare this pet with the TGC items you can put on AH is pathetic since its so extremely rare that even any of the TGC boe ends up on AH this is all due to blizz loosing subs since subs = money and they know they gona sell a truckload of them.</div></div><hr />

Not insurmountable, but it'd be a call we'd really have to evaluate and be prepared to take on that extra work for every set that's produced. Riiiiight.. Maybe they can explain why every armor/race combination is already possible to view at wowhead. No.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Wowhead just applies the items to the alloted item slots. Which results in rather odd display from time to time. Just go match a few shoes to your tauren and you'll see they're not made for that.</div></div><hr />

Wont there be a massive inflation if they started legally selling gold for real money?<br />
And if you can legally and easily buy gold, you can pretty much buy gear for real money, so if you're willing to spend some real life money, you got better gear then other people at a certain point. I'm pretty sure that Blizzard has said that they don't want either of these things to happen.<br />
(And yes, I know that you can get much better gear raiding than buying it from the AH)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard is not selling gear, or gold (as in, they are not producing gold in a way that is at-point created... like you complete a quest, and recieve gold)... so no, there isn't going to be massive inflation. They're selling a pet that you can get gold that already exists inside a server environment, that one can do whatever with. The gold comes from other players.<br />
<br />
This is, already being done via a 3rd party rampantly and presently, and in the past for the last 7 years. The game is already set up that you really can't get the best-of-best gear by just simply throwing gold at everything -- the vast majority of epic gear needs to be obtained by actually participating in game content, not sitting on the auction house. If Blizzard provides a safe, alternate means to get neglible amounts of gold it won't imbalance or even affect PvP, it has a neglible impact on PvE as you've stated.<br />
<br />
People need to accept that RMT is not going to go away. If Blizzard completely goes back on this pet offering and even nixes the TCG reward BoE tradeability, account hackings will still continue as a source of gold harvesting, victimizing players who don't even participate in RMT sales.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard does go forward with this pet, and its functions in the way that they hope, then there'll be less demand for gold bought through a 3rd party (the people responsible for hackings). Less demand means less hackings. Less hackings means a more enjoyable experience for players.<br />
<br />
It is worth keeping in mind that Blizzard has resorted to many other means to curtail RMT in World of Warcraft over the last few years, including multiple successful lawsuits brought against RMT companies. They have account security and the gamer in mind in all of this. The entire MMO gaming industry has been fighting 3rd party RMT because of its destructive influence on the game by means of victimizing other players via hacking/phishing/zones downed out in bot farming/spam. This latest path has been proven in other games to be one of the most successful methods of curtailing RMT, as proven in games such as DDO. If you provide simple and legitimate means for people who are determined to slap down $5 to take the edge off of starting out with nothing in a game, those people are much less likely to go to a 3rd party site where they have no guarantee of safety or even delivered product.</div></div><hr />

That is very true. I guess I posted too early because I didn't really think about that. I was coming with counter-arguments, because I wasn't really anyone's side yet, and you were a very reasonable to talk to.<br />
<br />

It won't stop it though. One small pet can't stop all the 3rd party gold selling, it may not even affect it at all. The pet may sell for 10k gold at first, but after a month or two the price could drop down below 500g. But I guess if that happened they could introduce a new pet that works the same way. And even if this only makes one 3rd party gold selling site go down, it would be worth it.<br />
<br />
I'm completely with you now. Inflation won't happen because of what you said, they're not producing gold, the gold already exist in the server. And the chance of less 3rd party gold sellers and hackers is amazing of course, no one wants to get hacked.</div></div><hr />

But, i do know ppl who have downloaded some random addon and its had a trojan or some sort of phishing attached.undead and orc pallies...why would you want to be one?so tome of light IS getting nerfed? first they say its not...then later in the same post they say it is...make up your mind blizz!Guardian cubs...who cares. if people want to waste their money to convert it into WoW gold...thats alllll them.lastly, cool art :)<br />

DDEEEEERRRRRP. You can not get a virus from an addon that does not have an executable.</div></div><hr />

Truth is blizzard cannot ever, under any circumstance, &quot;stamp out&quot; gold sellers. Same concept as apple trying to &quot;stamp out&quot; jailbreakers. It cannot happen. sure hacking account's are wrong (mine was hacked and it sucked) and i really wish their was a way to stop it.. but you cant. you can try to combat it but in the end if you tell people they cant do something they'll find a way to do it simply to spite you. Gold sellers are simply a part of every MMO in the world their is no way to stop it no matter how hard they try.<br />
<br />
What I personally dislike about the pet is that its their first &quot;attempt&quot; at a purchasable BoE. Cosmetic item or not if it goes over well... they WILL add more crap to the blizz store.. and more and more and more and what is to stop them from adding more then pets/mounts after a while? If blizzard has shown us anything.. its that they're greedy. They're slowly turning this into a micro transaction game when we already have to pay a sub to play.... Micro transactions belong in F2P's not a p2p.<br />
<br />
Back on point about inflation thou, I don't see inflation happening because of the pet. But i do see it happening if they start adding more BoE stuff to the bliz store. it may not be &quot;creating gold&quot; but at some point people are going to say &quot;look i paid so and so $ for this.. i want this much gold if you dont like it then idc someone else can buy it&quot; and they will put a monetary price on gold which will cause inflation of prices because people will be like &quot;alright well since this much money is easy to get now because of how much people charge for stuff, im going to charge this&quot; and as the prices of the blizz store items go up and more gold is traded between toons, the higher people will price their items. like for example if you ask in guild how much money everyone has. and everyone has 100k then asking 10k for something crappy wouldnt be that far fetched since it would be &quot;a drop in the bucket&quot; If you've ever played an f2p you know exactly what im talking about. edit; im not being a doomsayer either, its unlikely to inflate prices by alot if they just keep it at cosmetic stuff. if they start actually putting game changing stuff like weapons/armors/heirlooms things like that on the blizzstore then we'll see inflation like crazy also the reason we havent saw the whole concept of &quot;i paid this for this item so you pay this much gold take it or leave it&quot; is because their hasn't yet been a &quot;universal&quot; price. the blizz store will change that thou. no more &quot;well i got it in my first booster pack! and then didnt get one for another 12&quot; it'll be more universal because you can get it 100% of the time by dropping x amount of money on the item in the blizz store.<br />
<br />
<br />
on another note, I love how they're giving a new graphic to hurricane. I guess they think the reason its never used is because its graphic and not because it does crappy damage and costs 81% base mana. :P they can pretty it up all they want but... it still wont be used unless they change it some how.</div></div><hr />
