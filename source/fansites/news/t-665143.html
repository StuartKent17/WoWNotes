China doesn't hate the Pandaren. China hated the Pandaren Samurai. Hence the Pandaren Monk.<br />

You do realise that all 3 buffs (Stamina, MotW &amp; Kings) are the only group buffs which are given by a specific class? This now gives the option to get a lesser version of these buffs without a Priest/Druid/Paladin in the raid.<br />
<br />
That's all. It's not supposed to make LW drums so powerful again that all hardcore raiders have to switch to LW.</div></div><hr />

No. The Tinnitis debuff was dropped and Blizz instead opted to phase out the current TBC drums by making them only usable from levels 70-79. They're completely worthless once you hit 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Arena Season 6 over, I'm expecting the new VoA boss to come out this next week. Also, this next week adds the last boss to the Trial of the Crusader and Grand Crusader. If I'm correct about the new VoA boss, this means access to the Teir 9 gear. Additionally, I'm also guessing this mean Onyxia's Lair will be on live servers this next week. This also means that the Crusader Orbs will start dropping from 10/25 ToC and Ony's lair. So I'm hoping that my guesses are true.<br />

I haven't seen any WoW Blizzard downloads yet, but it's still early in the week.</div></div><hr />

This isn't laziness. This is Blizzard listening to all the QQ that some buffs are mandatory. So now there's a way around needing a Paladin for Kings, a Priest for Fortitude, and a Druid for Gift of the Wild. No bloodlust/heroism equivalent there yet.<br />
<br />
Also, is there anything that says that these are soul-bound, or require the profession to use? I might be missing it. If there's not, then there's no need for people to re-roll LW, existing Leatherworkers (and scribes) will just get richer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
QQ more..... Sorry, but DKs have been OP for far too long. Everytime a class is OP they get nerfed to the ground and then slowly patched up again, only DKs stayed OP for so long and they just did slight nerfs every patch.<br />
Also, where the hell did Paladins get &quot;many buffs&quot;? <br />
<br />
Protection<br />
<br />
* Righteous Fury now increases the threat generated by your Holy spells by 80%. (Down from 90%) - NERF<br />
* Judgements of the Just now reduces the cooldown of your Hammer of Justice by 5/10 sec. (Down from 10/20 sec) - NERF<br />
* Touched by the Light now increases your spell power by an amount equal to 20/40/60% of your Strength. (Old - 10/20/30% of your Stamina) - Adjustement, not a buff<br />
* Blessing of Sanctuary now increases strength and stamina by 10% instead of just increasing stamina. - Adjustment, not a buff (I got 1222 Strength vs 2370 Stamina on my Prot Paladin so that's barely not a nerf, nor a buff)<br />
<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
<br />
* Seal of Command now has an additional effect - When used with attacks or abilities that strike a single target, this additional Holy damage will strike up to 2 additional targets. - A much needed buff, SoC has been the crappy seal people did not even learn until SoBlood was taken out of the game. This is a buff for Trash, for bosses it doesn't change shit.</div></div><hr />

Also - Abyssal Shatter WOOT!!! We got tons of Abyss Crystals and there will be more rather than less in the future, every Ulduar run we dissenchant a lot and you can actually farm the crystals in the Non-Heroic version of Trial of the Champion.<br />
<br />

The Ony Whelp pet is for the 5th anniversary of wow. You will get it in the mail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Arena Season 6 over, I'm expecting the new VoA boss to come out this next week. Also, this next week adds the last boss to the Trial of the Crusader and Grand Crusader. If I'm correct about the new VoA boss, this means access to the Teir 9 gear. &lt;b&gt;Additionally, I'm also guessing this mean Onyxia's Lair will be on live servers this next week.&lt;/b&gt; This also means that the Crusader Orbs will start dropping from 10/25 ToC and Ony's lair. So I'm hoping that my guesses are true.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any WoW Blizzard downloads yet, but it's still early in the week. <br />
<br />

Wrong, wrong, wrong. Its coming out in Nov. that is WoW's 5th b-day.</div></div><hr />

Whoa, didn't read that the talent doesn't remove the mana cost any more. I'm curious, what will work best now: 3 Stacks or 4 Stacks of the arcane blast debuff. <br />
But why did they decrease the time the debuff lasts?<br />
<br />
And to the pandarens: Wasn't their reason to not add pandaren as a playable race, that its forbidden to kill pandas (even in games) in china? Adding them as NPC or as a playable class would mean, that players are able to kill them, so it's not good^^</div></div><hr />

Edit: Id also like to say that I have nothing against pandaren... I would love to play one :) But the facts are the facts...

they decided to nerf the snake trap.<br />
<br />
Waaaaaaahaaaaahaaaaaaaa...<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
Hunter traps need BUFFS.<br />
What the hell are they thinking wasting time on such an undeserved, unnecessary and utterly useless change to the nr of snakes?<br />
<br />
Those snakes have below 200 hp each.<br />
That means they die to anything: thorns, aura's, even aoe.<br />
Glyph them for 90% avoidance?<br />
Only works for the aoe, and than still: 10% of a tick of 1500 or so, STILL kills them!<br />
That's the whole joke...<br />
<br />
Snake trap is basically an entrapment proc, NOTHING more in it's current state.<br />
Trap mastery can add 9 snakes, or 3... they still die instantly.<br />
<br />
This change is so useless, so unneeded, and such an insult for them even bothering to waste time on that (of all things...).<br />
<br />
Sure, reduce the snakes (whatever, really) but maybe give them some hp so they don't die instantly, ok?<br />
<br />
Sigh, hunter development... never ceases to amase you.<br />
<br />
This post is not a 'nerf QQ' by the way, it's a rofl on how they are capable of coming up with this crap when there are soooooo many other issues with our traps that need fixing first. MOST OF ALL snake trap...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's all. It's not supposed to make LW drums so powerful again that all hardcore raiders have to switch to LW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. They are now essentially a &quot;backup buff&quot;, which is a nice way to revive drums without making them OP. The average 25 man raid in a decent guild will usually have all three buffs, but it's invaluable for the rare occasion where they don't and it only takes up one or two bag slots. Should be a really welcome buff for ten man raids too which will be less likely to have all three.</div></div><hr />

Anyone knows if race change within the same faction is planned / confirmed?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the news that this is planned (and would be available &quot;short after faction change is available&quot;) was told at the BlizzCon. Not many details are available, though. But I also<br />

Yes I play a rogue. And it may surprise you but yes I don't want to be op. And 20k+ aoe dps was op.<br />

I remember it was told before this new details were out they wanted to make<br />
Sanctuary into a &quot;true tanking blessing, so that Protadins would take this, and not<br />
SdK&quot;. I think it was also said then, the two of them would not stack, but that<br />
Protadins should prefer Sanctuary over Kings for themselves. All written from memory,<br />
so no 100% guarantee on correctness.</div></div><hr />

Unlikely. An no, you're not getting 20k aoe DPS except on naxx spider trash and Freya trash and ONLY when combat and blowing AR+BF. So no, you're not doing it consistently, only during very specific situations.

<br />
I never said it was possible to do it consistently, but it was possible. FoK will still be viable on aoe groups (4-5+ mobs). What did you do before FoK was added to the game? We still got a nice AOE skill so we don't get bored on big trash groups, and that's all Blizzard wanted us to have in the first place.<br />
Also the other specs are not affected at all. Assassination will be doing 30% less white damage, and Combat will be doing 30% less white damage as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They did that because Gift of the Wild can be improved to be better than +750 armor, +37 stats, and +54 resistances through talents, Prayer of Fortitude can be improved to be better than +165 stam through talents, but Blessing of Kings has no talent to improve it to be better than the base 10%. They don't want drums to make certain classes useless so they make them slightly inferior to having the actual class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sure, but in most cases, the talented version is used in group play, so http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=17051 and http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=14767 do apply and make the original spell stronger than its new substitute.<br />

Feral<br />
Predatory Strikes (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/16975/) now has an additional effect - In addition, your finishing moves have a 7/13/20% chance per combo point to make your next Nature spell with a base casting time less than 10 sec. become an instant cast spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does this seem completely overpowered?<br />
Predatory Strikes is 4 levels down into the Feral Tree.<br />
No Druid caster is going to seriously put any points in the feral tree. <br />
And there are no non-instant cast nature spells that you can cast that would benifit a feral druid.<br />
<br />
Except healing. All druid heals are in the nature school. So if this affects the healing spells, then I am making a macro that will cast a Nourish or Healing Touch and with the next click put me back into cat form.<br />
Of course, I can only see a feral DPS specced cat using this feature. It would make Feral a bitch to kill in PVP, and would make them God-like in a raid as the healers would not need to touch them.<br />
<br />
**Work up 5 combo points, use finishing move of your choice, cast nourish/healingtouch, shift back to cat, eat enemies.**<br />
<br />
Please tell me I am missing something. Preferably with some thoughts to back it up.</div></div><hr />

We are talking about Azeroth, where we see structures living because of the pure fact that they are magically enhanced... and you say a panda cant be a monk?</div></div><hr />

We leather workers have now been given a utility role similar to Engineer's repair bots and I love it. As a Shaman, who brings no persistent buffs to the party, it'll prove to be a boon to my usefulness as part of a group.<br />
<br />
An item like this definitely benefits 5 and 10 mans where you may end up missing a druid or paladin. The buffs are weaker than the versions that would be supplied by the actual class ability and I think that's fair.<br />
<br />
On the downside it's a continuation of Blizzard's &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; campaign which could be said to be homogenizing the game into one big vanilla mass. Iconic class abilities now aren't simply being given to other classes (MS, SoE, etc.) they're being given to everyone through the profession system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because we're clearly overpowered in PvP, amirite? I mean, we should just flail about like a dead fish and cause the enemy 1% of their HP in damage before dying terribly after our traps are resistated and we're CCed multiple times in place, stunned, or disorientated.<br />
<br />
No wonder every hunter rolled a DK. Blizzard doesn't know how to do anything with us to make us good again without making us OP, but they let DKs and ret paladins wtfown us without so much as a second glance.<br />
<br />
OH WAIT GUISE WE GET FOCUS WHICH WILL PROBABLY BLOW AND NOT WORK AT ALL BUT UHHH IT MIGHT FIX THE HUNTER CLASS!11ONE<br />
<br />
I mean, it's not enough that explosive shot was nerfed, nerfed again, had the stun removed from it, glyph of the monkey was removed, our traps are rolled over and resisted, castrandom macro was removed, deterrence is useless because some crap still goes through it since it's bugged, disengage is useless because if there's a pebble behind you you glitch out or a DK pulls you back, RoS is terrible now, Marksman still has terribad mana problems and BM is laughable, but we need MORE nerfs so we can be even more bottom-of-the-barrel in PvP! It's kinda sad when, if you see a hunter in BGs or arena, you lol at them and proceed to faceroll them and /dance on their corpse because they're a free kill. We're supposed to be the anti-stealth class, but track hidden PLUS flare isn't enough to catch a rogue before it stuns you, and then if you don't trinket out and your pet is busy you're a dead man, since lol we have no way to heal. We're supposed to be the kiting class, but Blizz makes damned sure that we're not able to kite.<br />
<br />
And what's still amazing is that, through all this, we're still considered the ezmode class by people who haven't played us, and get told L2P IT'S EZ TO KITE A PALADIN OR DK LOLO UR FINE SRSLY UR JUST A HUNTARD by the other half of people that seem to think we're all idiots and the reason nobody PvPs on a hunter is because all of us are unskilled.<br />
<br />
Alot of raging for a small snake trap nerf, and maybe I was being a little dramatic, but it's been building up for a long time. Hunters feel like Blizzard's redheaded stepchild...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What's interesting in your post is that you state people says hunter are OP but don't know the class. However, after reading your whole post I can be assure that you haven't been playing PvP to a higher level than 2000. Hunters are far from being the most horrible class in PvP, for the two following reasons :<br />
<br />
They are destroying any casters in PvP on a long term fight<br />
They are able to kite most melee classes with the solo help of their frost trap, since it's an undispellable buff. Only warriors may really catch them easily<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's go over those 2 reasons : With a healer (druid/pally or even shaman/priest) you will be in the long term killing any other ranged classes. You posses a mortal strike debuff that other range don't have and you can still LoS the attack of the range while still attacking yourself.<br />
<br />
Regarding the melee : Dk should not touch you, you simply start kiting them through the trap and they can't reach you, there is nothing they can do to compete in the damage. If they death grip, you disengage and you repeat. Pallies are harder to support for 9 seconds that's trues but for 16 seconds after you have easy and free kitting. Rogues are being kite though the traps, with a druid it's even easier. And warrior, well warrior cause a real problem with there very short charge CD and intercept.<br />
<br />
Now let's talk about CC, hunter (survival) has a 10 seconds CC evert 26 seconds, 6 seconds sting every minut, and 4 seconds scatter every 15 seconds. Not too bad i think? No.<br />
<br />
Yes I'll admint hunters are really hard to play well in arena. There is a lot of aspect of the game you have to focus on and they are harder to play then most cleave, but don't say you don't have what it take to be good in PvP, hunters can destroy most classes out there ;)<br />
<br />
And on a side note :<br />
<br />
<br />
YAY! Lets nerf the only rogue AE! I did COMPETENT, not extraordinary, but competent AoE DPS with Fan of Knives in PvE. A basic nerf isn't the way to fix it. It may fix roguetarding in PvP, but it's destroying rogue's only AE in PvE. Just removing the throwing specialization effect would have been sufficient. Or they could have made resilience have an increased effect on damage reduction with FoK.<br />
<br />
The nerf to damage, has NOTHING to do with the FoK spawm in arena, the damage is ridiculous. The change for arena has been done through the interupt. The nerf to damage is because rogue are best, or second in term of AoE and it's not something that should happen. Rogues are kind on single, no reason we should be (I played a rogue too) king on AoE too ;)<br />

Kitty Swipe is only applied to mobs 180° in front of me (granted bear is 360° because of same effect as concecrapy), so if i possition wrong it hits only one mob, FOK on the other hand is 360°, so garanteed to hit all mobs, so anyone can use it without having to think of possitioning right. Granted swipe does an insane amount of damage (myself gone above 16k on trash packs in naxx) but you take shit loads of agro and prob, if you do it a bit to soon, you'll pull all the trash on you witch = insta death.</div></div><hr />

Is it going to be released as a race change (ex: Dwarf to Human) or will it be released as a faction change (Human to Tauren)?<br />
<br />
Any clear clarification on this is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
