MMO-Champion Update - Boss Pages and New Menu!<br />
We're getting closer to the Patch 3.1 release on live servers and I finally had the time to push live a nice menu for all the patch 3.1 content and a nicer version of all the ulduar bosses pages! There is still a few bugs with it but they should be fixed as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
You can expect a few more categories and pages very soon, today's update is merely to make sure that I stop postponing it. <br />

A little question, do you guys think the server will hit live next week?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asrial</div><div class="date">2009-04-02, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should hit within 1 or 2 weeks. Most likely next week.<br />
Almost all of the bosses is tested.<br />
Arena and BG is tested.<br />
Items was tested along the other tests.<br />
Only Algalon the observer and Yogg saron is needing a test.<br />
Small chance that Yogg saron wont be tested, due to not to spoil the most epic raid since AQ40. :p Algalon will recieve maybe 2-3 testing nights. So count on downloading after the easter. :)</div></div><hr />

we know that s5 ends 14th of April and that there will be one week off before new season starts, so i imagine that 3.1 will be live 14 or 21 no?<br />
<br />
or next week :) but it has to be live on 21st.</div></div><hr />
