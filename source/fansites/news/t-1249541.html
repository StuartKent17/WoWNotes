Patch 5.2 - No Item Upgrades<br />
Ghostcrawler clarified his previous statement (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/287655171583004672) and let us know that no gear will be upgraded at all once Patch 5.2 is released, as the NPC will be removed. <br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 - LFR Item Level Requirement<br />
Just wanted to share some updated info we have with you guys: At this moment our intent is to change Thunder King’s LFR ilvl requirement to 480, we also want to lower the Honor gear in patch 5.2 from 483 to 476, compensating with some bonus PvP stats, so that the gear remains as powerful for PvP but not allow players to use it as a quick shortcut into LFR.<br />
<br />
Like always, everything is subject to change, we’re still in PTR stage folks! And we all know that even on live things can still change, while we always strike to avoid doing that (and that’s why we have a PTR), gameplay comes first, so if a change is urgently needed, we do our best to apply it as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues<br />
PvP Power<br />
<br />
On live, PvP Power grants 0% healing to Balance, Feral, Windwalker, Retribution, Shadow, Enhancement and Elemental. In the next 5.2 build, this number will be 25% (or half of what a healing spec gets). We agree that PvP healing feels too weak for these hybrid classes. We also don't think Shadow really needs this buff, so we will likely offset it in other ways.<br />
We are working on a blog (hopefully next week) to explain some of the other changes to PvP gear in 5.2. We hear your concerns and are trying to address them.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
<br />
The Protection 2pc is additive. It's duration is 5sec per Holy Power. We realize there are concerns about this enabling block capping, and are keeping an eye on this, and will adjust if necessary to make sure it doesn’t happen, even later in the expansion.<br />
The Protection 4pc does incentivize Unbreakable Spirit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114154). We’re considering possible revisions but want to try it like this for now. It's currently &quot;You gain 1 Holy Power for each 20% of your health taken as damage while Divine Protection (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/498) is active.&quot;<br />
The Retribution 2pc is a debuff on the target, and does not stack or roll. With Glyph of Mass Exorcism (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/879), the debuff will be applied to all targets hit by the Exorcism (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/879). It affects all of your Holy damage. Yes, that includes Seal of Truth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31801), Censure (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31803) ticks, and Hand of Light. Censure (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31803) ticks are affected per tick whether it was up when Censure (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31803) was applied doesn't matter. It functions similar to the increased magic damage taken raid debuff, except is Holy-only and self-only. Clipping some debuffs when you get back to back Art of War procs is expected, and balanced around.<br />
The Retribution 4pc does grant a self-buff that is consumed by the next TV, and does not stack. Wasting some procs is expected, and balanced around. Yes it is a single-target benefit that won't increase DPS on AE fights. We don't want to be in such a limited design space (we're talking about the 15th tier here after all) that every set bonus must be super generic and work in every situation. If anything, we'd rather the Ret bonus be even higher for single-target and paladins will just be stronger at single-target and weaker at AE once they have the set bonus than they are in other tiers. Set bonuses are one of the few chances we have to change what your character does (within reason) aside from all of your numbers just getting bigger.<br />
We changed the Repentance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20066) cast time to make it consistent with other cast time crowd control. A 1.5 sec cast time (reduced by haste) gives little opportunity for interruption.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q))<br />
<br />
During Shuriken Toss (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114014), your auto attacks are replaced with throwing Shurikens, which do 80% weapon damage, but are on the 'yellow combat table', meaning they don't glance, and don't suffer the Dual Wield (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124146) miss penalty. The 80% number was chosen because that approximately offsets those other benefits.<br />
In our above description of Blade Flurry (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13877), 'normal' means the same as it previously did; that is to say, the damage that the ability would have done had it hit the secondary target.<br />
The 2pc does encourage using Rupture (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1943) as Combat. <br />
Burst of Speed (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108212) saying &quot;movement-reducing&quot; means that it no longer breaks roots, but does break snares.<br />
We are experimenting with allowing Smoke Bomb (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/76577) to reduce the damage done to allies by 20%. We agree that rogues are lacking in the group utility department and we'd like to see less use of Smoke Bomb (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/76577) strictly as an offensive ability in PvP.<br />
We are going to reduce the PvP set bonus from +50 energy to +30 energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
<br />
Storm, Earth, and Fire does not affect Xuen's damage. The spirits benefit from your Tiger Eye Brew. We agree that a spell with &quot;storm, earth and fire&quot; in the name sounds like a shaman spell, but Warcraft 3 established it as a Pandaren monk ability.<br />
The Mistweaver 2pc is multiplicative. The first target gets normal healing, the second gets 115% of normal, and the third gets 132.25% of normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
<br />
The 2pc and 4pc both can crit.<br />
Direhorn Stampede (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121818) are everything you dream them to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
<br />
Please note that Restoration Mushrooms are currently incorrectly absorbing 33% of overheal each, instead of 25%.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
<br />
The Elemental 4pc does trigger from Overloads.<br />
We're still iterating on the cooldown/potency/duration of Elemental Mastery (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/16166). In the next PTR build, it will likely be a 90 sec cooldown. <br />
We are experimenting with removing the attenuation of Chain Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/421). This means Chain Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/421) won't do less damage on subsequent targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
The Shadow 2pc does impact Shadow Word: Insanity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/129249), which we're working to resolve. It extends existing effects, preserving their same damage (not recalculating).<br />
We are considering making the glyphs of Desperation and Inner Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/89485) passive for Discipline.<br />
We are considering giving Focused Will to Holy as well as Discipline.<br />
We did not buff PvP Power for healer damage as we did for DPS healing. However, we believe that Discipline specifically might need more damage. One potential solution is to nerf Atonement (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81749) healing but raise damage so there is no net healing change.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
<br />
With the 2pc, an Incinerate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29722) crit has an 8% chance to generate 4/10 of an ember. Yes, this will apply to Fire and Brimstone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108683) Incinerate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29722).<br />
We are strongly considering allowing Dark Intent (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109773) to provide Stamina so that warlocks don't feel like they must use their imp.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
<br />
A Prot Warrior using 2 pieces of the DPS set will get 1.0 RPPM of the Enrage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5229).<br />
We agree with concerns that the new Arms rotation doesn't involve much rage management. We are considering a small rage cost for Overpower (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/7384). Arms will likely need some additional retuning of damage because of the changes to Overpower (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/7384), Taste for Blood (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56638) and Slam (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1464) we haven't completed tuning yet.<br />
We made a change to warriors to double the effect of haste for them. This is similar to the shaman Flurry (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/16282) benefit, but is passive and not tied to an ability. We want to make haste a better stat for warriors without it eclipsing stats like crit we aren't trying to force every warrior to reforge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Promises<br />
We're not making any (except maybe that Direhorn Stampede bit). We're providing you some notes of changes we are currently trying in order to provide you context for some of the other class changes. Many of these may not make it to the live game -- that is the nature of a PTR. As always, we appreciate feedback on any of this.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
<br />
Storm, Earth, and Fire: The spirits will not mirror non-damaging abilities like Leg Sweep (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/119381) or Charging Ox Wave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/119392). They will mirror damaging abilities like Chi Wave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115098). In the cases of damaging abilities that also heal (Chi Wave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115098), Zen Sphere (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124081), and Chi Burst (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/130651)), their healing and yours is reduced. But for other heals which aren’t mirrored (like Healing Sphere (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115460), Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784) from the front, or consuming a Healthstone), it won’t reduce the healing. In the case of Zen Sphere (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124081), the spirits will cast it on themselves when you cast it on anyone. Note that many of these things aren’t working yet, but should in the next PTR build, or perhaps the one after that. Also, in the next PTR build, attempting to cast it on a target that already has one of your spirits on it will recall that spirit.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Enhancement 4pc triggers each time Windfury procs, not for each attack it generates.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
<br />
If you have the Protection 2pc, casting Word of Glory (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85673) again when you already have the block buff will replace the existing buff, if the new one is longer duration. It won’t extend.<br />
The Protection 4pc will not count for Holy Avenger (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/105809).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
The Healing 2pc causes each Prayer of Mending (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33110) Heal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2050) to heal for 10% more than the last; it’s multiplicative. 100%-&gt;110%-&gt;121%-&gt;133%-&gt;146%.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
<br />
The Restoration 4pc causes each Rejuvenation (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/774) tick to heal for 6% more than the last; it’s multiplicative. 100%-&gt;106%-&gt;112%-&gt;119%-&gt;126%-&gt;134%-&gt;etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
<br />
We will reword the 2pc to be more clear about how it works. “Your Shield Slam (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23922) and Revenge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6572) have a 10% chance to activate Victory Rush (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34428) or Impending Victory (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103840) as if you had killed your target.”<br />
<br />

<br />
Some have asked why the 2pc procs more often for Survival than Marksmanship. Marksmanship typically has more haste than Survival, such as from Steady Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53224). (Remember, RealPPM proc rates scale with your haste).<br />

Throne of Thunder and Mounts<br />
Finally, I think we need to be able to mount in that instance. I think travel time is just going to be way too much of a problem otherwise.<br />
The fact that you cannot currently mount in the exterior ruins section of the zone is a bug. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/250646-feedback-council-of-elders-10n/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7592801294?page=2#32))<br />

Incentive to explore has always been a weak point in WoW,Can we expect more achievements like &quot;Lost and Found&quot; to remedy this?<br />
We just have to make exploring really exploring and not download a mod / visit a website. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280718528129163264))<br />
<br />
just wanted to clarify something r u now or have you ever been completely or partially against flying mounts?<br />
It's not that simple. It would be hard to remove them, yet we don't like how they minimize exploration, travel &amp; sense of danger. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281095178448670720))<br />
Isnt minimizing travel the whole point of a mount? Also, they dont minimize exploration, in my case they improve it<br />
The journey is a big (biggest?) part of most fantasy tales. For me, exploration needs a hint of danger to be interesting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281136436734984192))<br />
that doesn't really answer my question<br />
It's not a question with a simple answer. Sorry. If I could go back in time, I would argue for much stricter limits on them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281459220476481538))<br />
I remember reading a PvP blog that flying mounts made escaping too easy, do you think &quot;hardened shell&quot; is enough?<br />
It was just an experiment to see how it felt. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281533125488689153))<br />
<br />
Do you feel like CRZ takes away the one advantage small pop servers had of less competition for rare spawns?<br />
We don't really want small pop servers to have advantages though. We think larger pop servers are more fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285815310253174785))<br />
<br />
I know u r concerned about the role of guilds in xrealm raiding, but isn't the point of being n a guild 2 b with ppl u like?<br />
There are still benefit in realm community. Queuing features are a necessary evil, not because we don't value community. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285810072565710848))<br />

Misc<br />
I have friends who've already tried the expac. They got to 90 and they've already given up, &quot;I have to log in EVERY day....!?&quot;<br />
The opposite extreme is &quot;Why am I playing this game? I log in once a week and then there is nothing else to do.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285466244671475714))<br />

Remember, while convenience is nice, accomplishments are rewarding. Accomplishments with too much convenience may not feel rewarding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285823041265623040))<br />
Parapharsing someone I can't recall: &quot;We don't play this game because it is easy, we play it because it is hard.&quot;<br />
In China, I hear a lot: I don't play the game because it's fun. I play for prestige. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285891833110863872))<br />
<br />
Being a casual has nothing to do with what GC is saying.<br />
In fact casual players are probably more likely to opt out of hard content for which rewards will be quickly replaced. <br />
Also i believe the &quot;accomplishment envy&quot; faction is small. And why should a game be catered to envy?<br />
.It's not about that. It's &quot;Why should I bother on this tough boss when the new content will just invalidate all the gear anyway?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285817339918835712))<br />
<br />
yes it does. I wish GC would just announce once and for all the game is tailored for the hardcores.<br />
It's not. Not sure there are 10 million hardcore players in the world. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285889564600565760))<br />
<br />
More and more people are heading to private vanilla servers, why not just make an official one?<br />
We don't want to maintain two versions of the game (and we don't believe that the vanilla crowd would be happy with no support). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285881503165054976))<br />
<br />
Nobody cares about dummy dps because there is no movement involved and such bosses dont exist in mop.<br />
If only that were true. Players use simulated dummy dps as evidence all the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285473346517352449))<br />

Holy crap it's amazing how stark the contrast in whining you hear from this community. So many people convinced Blizz sold out for &quot;casuals&quot; and then casuals convinced Blizz only caters to hardcore people with no lives. It's enough to drive a man to be a hedgehog rustler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, no? Once you've purchased all the pieces you can use for your Main and offsets, what are you supposed to do with the excess valor? You should be capping anyway, if you're on the Black Prince's valor quest. If you're not, dunno what you're doing in the game.</div></div><hr />

that makes me feel better then. atleast ill have stuff to spend it on now. <br />
<br />
if they dont bring upgrades back in 5.3 though its just going to look really stupid though. i mean seriously if they were unsure about it why didnt they do more internal testing before upgrading the ui and everything?</div></div><hr />

They might just be testing things out. Why bother just leaving him there to confuse people who don't check patch notes, when they can take him out? It sounds like they don't want anyone using the system, not just specific ilvls.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. It's a bit retarded, that upping your wrists costs as much as upping your chest or weapons.<br />

Mostly because some people can't get lucky with loot and will continue to be stuck with that 1-2 463 items, be it their mains or alts, come 5.2 and beyond. Other than that, I don't particularly care that item upgrading will be gone.</div></div><hr />

That no one really cares about mushrooms because they can absorb as much overhealing you want, that healing will be overhealing too !<br />
Balance druids are still left with Wrath hitting like a wet noodle, NO mobile Dps, Mighty Bash getting dodged and parried and requiring melee range for a ranged spec, Ridiculous sustained damage, and finally our burst getting reduced with the NV nerf.<br />

Whew, at least I'm not the only person who wishes he would fix himself up a bit better. :p<br />
<br />
And I think part of the reason for removing the valor upgrade in 5.2 is due to there being better ilvl valor items to buy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Just like someone said, the sudden remove will screw some hardcore raiders if they don't plan well.<br />
They MUST cap 1000 valor every week now until 4.2.<br />
<br />
Will the current PvP conquest 483 gear drop back down 476 after 4.2?<br />
or honor gear in 4.2 is different from the current conquest 483 gear?<br />
<br />
If the current conquest gear is more powerful than the 4.2 honor gear, it is too late to PvP in this entire expansion.</div></div><hr />

Now when the sha socket 2H axe drops from Sha in terrace, my Starshatters are better, because they're upgraded, and I need two of those axes. What a bunch of retarded thinking really. Leave the upgrades alive and kicking for everything but 5.2 items, and be done with it for that patch. <br />
<br />
For all I care you can remove the upgrade system completely and never bring it back, but leave it alive and kicking for all the items we currently have. It's just stupid to take it out in the middle of someone upgrading path and what not.</div></div><hr />

Justice points are now totally useless, no need for them at all. Even the gear you buy with JP is worse than HC dungeon gear.<br />

<br />
Can't decide whether I like it or not. It turned out to be a pretty nice feature on my alts for the heroic gear, and at least made Justice points somewhat useful for a little while longer. Hopefully they add something in to do with them other than buy old Cata mats or convert it into honor points.</div></div><hr />

A large percentage of the WoW community will not be in end game/current raid gear. The ones who are already are great at what they do and could out do normal players even if they were in blues and the normal players were in end game epics, so why would end game players need a boost to stats if they rock anyway?<br />

<br />
It breaks gear scaling for the next tier, i bet if it comes back after 5.2 they change how it works.<br />
For example they dont want you to totally skip normal mode gearing, currently if you have 517 upgraded gear but normal mode tier 15 drops 510 gear most guilds will just skip that gearing step.<br />
<br />
Even hardcore guilds spend there extra time gearing alts in normals and giving people less to do probably isn't the best for any game.<br />

I liked the feature and i hope it comes back even in a different form.</div></div><hr />

The upgrade system was terribad and I hope it never ever returns. I play a Monk (with which it's virtually impossible to get high ratings without glad partners, only a few players in the world have done it).

I think they understand people will burn out fast, with dailies, new VP gear to buy, and then dailies to upgrade, LFR ( which seems to have taken over normal modes on low pop servers) and reg/heroic raiding, then dailies to upgrade it all.. They prob don't have THAT many new dalies to keep it interesting either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well that's because what NOW constitutes hardcore and casuals (as those terms are used in forums such as this) is much different than what it used to be. The casuals have become more casual as blizz gave more and more things to them. As such, anytime anything new requires any effort at all they consider it to be catering to the &quot;hardcore&quot; crowd not realizing that most of the stuff they consider hardcore really isn't by Vanilla WoW standards (the &quot;hardcores&quot; aren't as hardcore as they used to be either). <br />
<br />
It doesn't help that blizzard keeps changing their minds and implementing and removing features like JP gear upgrades and more and than slightly less dailies. The new &quot;hardcore&quot; features really aren't hardcore but rather attempts by Blizzard to slow progression solely for the purpose of trying to stop players from blowing thru content way faster then they can develop it and un-subbing while waiting for the next patch. But constantly trying to put the genie back in the bottle (to extend game play and not to appeal to hardcores) and then caving to the whiners feeds perceptions about the state of the game that allow for the simultaneous conclusion that they are catering to either the hardcores or the casuals.<br />
<br />
In reality what they have done is to destroy the suspension of disbelief and immersion required to make WoW the epic adventure it once was. To be very honest they would probably be better off just going the farmville route completely because the game really isn't hardcore, by any objective standard, and the casuals would complain less. While it might not be better it would be a more consistent and honest approach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. JP gear requiring rep at launch<br />
2. No VP items available until Revered<br />
3. Really screwed up system of ´upgrading´items where weapons and chest cost the same as wrist and belts.<br />
4. Muddling of heroics and scenarios.. where it is fairly easy to get epics from scenarios, but nearly impossible in heroics, and then having to roll against others for it.<br />
<br />
I do like the change where LFR-1 is the catchup mechanism rather than having 2-3 heroics that you have to do crazy amounts of times. I like the new LFR loot system and lucky coins, and generally I like the way you need reps to buy valor items.<br />
<br />
But 1-4 above makes it seem like they really did not think things through on how a player would progress. When you build your game around gear progression, you better have it pretty tight.</div></div><hr />

This is what GC said in previous posts, that gear from 5.2 could only be upgraded in non-raid pacthes.<br />

The fact -you- don't see a reason is irrelevant. The people who develop the game see a reason. And there is nothing in his statements that should lead you to believe it won't return. They already explained the shift to off-raid patches well enough for any adult to understand.</div></div><hr />

Who cares about that it comes back.<br />
<br />
If you happen to have an ilvl510 upgraded Starshatter it's better as the ilvl509 Shin'ka by a lot, and since there will be no-way to upgrade Shin'ka to ilvl 517, there is no point for me to even go to Terrace, to even get it, the legendary gem weapon is all-of-a-sudden usless, which was supposed to be the best weapon raid progress wise. <br />
<br />
It just makes not sense, to remove item upgrades for 5.0, 5.1. There's even a bigger gap for normal gear. The upgrade on some items is simply amazing. <br />
<br />
I really don't care if they remove the item upgrading forever from 5.2, but they should leave it up for 5.0, 5.1 items, it's that simple. People are in the middle of upgrading, and why would they fuck them over now, for no reason at all, the &quot;damage&quot; has been done, just leave it in, don't allow 5.2 items to be upgraded, everything is fine.</div></div><hr />

Other than upgrading your weapon, which I saw was worth the valor, 750 VP on items that give you 40-50 int/str/agil and maybe 20 haste/crit/mastery seems hardly worth being forced to upgrade, especially with how much equipment there is. If you had the intention on making your set fully upgraded, that's 750 x 2 x 16. That's 24,000 VP - 24 weeks... about 5 1/2 months. Meditate on that for a moment =p<br />
<br />
Also, it's obviously still up for debate, and I'm a firm believer that what the community says does make a difference, so everyone certainly should give an opinion.. constructively. To me, so long as they deliver potential craftables, VP gear to purchase and the obvious raid/LFR per raid patch, then there's a way to upgrade at the start, always. Some will just get higher up faster. However, if they do fully remove it, then we're all still on the same playing field =) no VIP upgrade tickets for anyone!</div></div><hr />

It wasn't like this in the past, I got all my gear from VP, got offspec gear from VP and could stop caring.

<br />
I already have 3 90's and they are all above or at 480 so it doesn't affect them. But I like playing alts so this makes the already terrible expansion for alts (d/t dailies/gating) even worse.<br />

But constantly trying to put the genie back in the bottle (to extend game play and not to appeal to hardcores) and then caving to the whiners feeds perceptions about the state of the game that allow for the simultaneous conclusion that they are catering to either the hardcores or the casuals.<br />
<br />
In reality what they have done is to destroy the suspension of disbelief and immersion required to make WoW the epic adventure it once was. To be very honest they would probably be better off just going the farmville route completely because the game really isn't hardcore, by any objective standard, and the casuals would complain less. While it might not be better it would be a more consistent and honest approach.<br />
<br />
I agree with almost everything here. I just hope they don't decide on the farmville idea. They have sold out enough.</div></div><hr />

So, I've gathered that little amount of VP I can and I was presented with an option of buying one new better item from some faction quartermaster or upgrade a couple of items from the existing gear knowing very well that the latter was subject to the rng 'oh you have just spent all your vp on upgrades and after weeks of no drops, let me now shower you with many drops in LFR, so all your upgrade are null'.<br />
<br />
In a way it is a great idea but for me it didn't work out, not in the current system as it is.<br />

Why do you insist on playing this game, you seem to be a slave.<br />
<br />
The reality is, you don't have to do any of those things, but then again, all those things are an incentive to actually play the game as opposed to stand in a major city waiting for a raid to happen like it happened 4 month into every previous expansion. I feel like I'm getting my monthly subscriptions worth for the first time in many years. That said, I'm not doing dailys, LFR or cap valor every week, I take breaks and I do it only when I'm up to it, but as said at least when I log into the game I have a reason to play the game outside of guild raids.<br />
<br />
Removing item-upgrading completely will just make raids prior to 5.2 non-interesting, and we're back to only one viable raid instead of having still options to go to HoF, Terrace and upgrading an item from there that might help you in 5.2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, while their at it how about we just remove heroic modes too, its such a pain having to learn fights twice and wiping so much. And lets remove cooking, enchanting and anything else that you 'need' for raiding. It is ridiculous to remove upgrades altogether, it would be one thing to just turn it off for new gear, but now you are essentially taking a ton of gear out of the game. <br />
<br />
Upgrading is really useful when trying to get the required ilvl for things like LFR, which is quite annoying when you have a geared main character and you are leveling alts.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't be too sure about that. GC also stated that currently you have way too much to do with an item in order to get it to it's max potential.<br />
<br />
Gem, enchant, reforge AND upgrade. It's all a bit much and they want to reduce on the burdens.<br />

<br />
If they dont want raiders to be forced to cap max valor everyweek .. why not just give more valor for each boss kill or <br />
they need to come out with something like a scenario within a raid, like what we had in ICC (e.g. lady deathwhisper a random add dude spawn that needs to stay alive throughout the fight or u fail the objective or the stone giant thing( the stone giant one sucks though it didnt happen during boss fight )) in order to get some reward. That was kinda challenging and new back then, didnt know why the idea got scrapped later on in cata.<br />
<br />
They could grant some special item / currency that allows u to upgrade ur item if u manage to complete the objective while killing raid boss , makes the encounter more interesting and less dull. (for 10 / 25 raids only , not for LFR)<br />

<br />
Also is hilarious how many of you pay 0 attention, the Item upgrade is planned to come back in none raid patches (i.e. 5.3) acourding to GC, so it will stilll serve as a good catch up for returning players. Please do research before you make walls to blindly complain.<br />
I did catch something a while back where they said they would give us plenty of notice if a season was ending. I haven't seen that, maybe I just missed it or something. To give you the benefit of the doubt, I tried googling heaps of combinations of &quot;pvp season 12 ending/end date&quot;, etc. Didn't return any results. I even checked the current PTR patch notes to see if there was anything about season 13 starting. Nada. I didn't PvP during Cata, so maybe I've missed some things, but I do know that other content that has been datamined from new builds on the PTR (Heirloom rings besides the Kalu'ak Derby one) haven't always been included in the PTR, let alone made it to live.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of your angry rebuke, I'm not concerned about 5.3. That's going to be released at an indeterminate time in the future, and as others have pointed out, they haven't confirmed that the NPC is returning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are you being so dramatic? Far and few between are the times Blizz has ever sold its playerbase down the river, so please cut this apocalyptic talk out.<br />
&quot;Dramatic&quot;? &quot;Apocalyptic&quot;? I was just pointing out a pattern of neglect for PvP. You're putting words in my mouth, I never said anything about them &quot;[selling their] playerbase down the river&quot;, all I said was that if they're looking at making a change to balance something in PvE, and it inadvertently imbalances something in PvP, that they are either unaware of the imbalance or unconcerned about it.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of QQ about how players were &quot;forced&quot; to valor cap. That's absolutely ridiculous. You're not forced to do anything in WoW, but if you want to have better things, you have to be willing to put the time in. Some days I think of doing dailies, and the idea just repulses me so much that I don't bother with them. Other times, I'll do them because I want something from them (not because I enjoy them).<br />
<br />
Nobody's forcing you to cap points to upgrade your gear, you just want better gear - or, alternatively, for other people who are willing to put more time into it, to have that advantage denied of them. You don't want to cap your points, but you don't want anybody else to be able to either so they can't do more damage than you, or take your precious raid spot. It's pure envy, and it's really, really pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How so? If you truly are a raider then you would know that raiding gets you about 65% of the way to cap if you do dailies you easily hit cap and since tokens are near required you are doing dailies. As for the upgrade, its anything but required. Besides weapons its such a tiny upgrade, about 2% dps gain, and even less valuable for tanks and healers. And if you really thought you were going to upgrade every piece of gear then you're clearly not good at math. If you want a necessary grind then dailies for tokens are still in play. <br />
<br />
I'm happy they aren't allowing you to upgrade new gear in 5.2 but not letting you upgrade you old gear is dumb.</div></div><hr />

GC made mentions about having to make choices between the VP gear and gear upgrades which is something that affects those who dont do raids more than those who are hard core progression raiders. He also tweeted that players shouldnt feel like it is mandatory to VP cap every week. This change and your rant points more towards the system not being friendly for &quot;casual&quot; players who have other things to do with their time while the &quot;no lifers&quot; ether hard core raiders or not, dont have an issues with hitting VP cap and are the ones who are loosing out.<br />

I don't believe they're responding to a vocal minority at all.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet, though I don't have any way to prove it, that they have actual statistics that show the exact opposite of what you've written. I'm betting their data shows that only a very small percentage of people are actually using the upgrade option. Anecdotally, I know very few people, outside of my core raider friends, who have bothered with the upgrade process. It seems meaningless for JP gear, seeing as there are a myriad of different ways to replace 463 gear with 476 or better gear including heroics and scenarios, LFR, and dailies for rep gear. By the time someone upgrades a bunch of 463 to 471, they could have had mostly 476 gear or better. If you're a raider, it seems like a chore rather than an optional part of the game.<br />
<br />
GC is right about the fact that this adds another layer of burden on everyone. As previously mentioned, we already have gemming, enchanting, and reforging to do per gear item. An upgrade process is overkill. GC has already tweeted that there will be more VP gear which also implies a shifting of the current tier of gear so the gearing path for alts should be fine.<br />
<br />
Upgrading felt like a band aid and the system itself a was a mess. I'm glad it'll be gone and hope it stays gone. That said, Bliz didn't do such a stellar job with the JP/VP currency values this time around and, hopefully, they can learn from their mistake and fix it with subsequent tiers.</div></div><hr />

@perculia Upgraded gear will not lose its upgrades. Upgrading will likely return after 5.2, but we'll evaluate all the feedback and see.<br />
<br />
As you can see current gear that you have upgraded keeps it's upgrade status. It is that new gear acquired in 5.2 will not be able to be upgraded. <br />
<br />
Not sure where you got the idea of currently upgraded gear would lose it's upgraded status and you may want to post links next time.</div></div><hr />

5.2 is when the new season is starting. New tier also brings a new season. They wouldn't be posting the pvp gear if there was not a new season. They will give notice but it will probably only be like 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2013-01-14, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quite enjoyed the upgrade system. I upgraded an item whenever I got within cap of valor points. Through LFR, dailies, dungeons, and scenarios I was capping 2-3 characters per week with relative ease since mid-November. My priorities were weapons, trinkets, then everything else. Dominance Offensive has my best upgrades at this time so I'm unfortunately saving points for the belts and boots from them across these characters, and I don't think I'll make it in time for patch to upgrade those slots to 502.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen the ilvl offering for LFR 5.2, which all of my characters will easily qualify for immediately (provided it's 480-483 minimum), but I'm relatively certain LFR will be granted 489/496 drops simply because we've been following the +13 model with regular raid gear since Wrath. <br />
<br />
I'm not a hardcore raider anymore (I prefer to play on my own time schedule) but I still like pushing my characters as far as I can with what I have access to. <br />
<br />
I think the message right now for casuals is less ominous than people make it out to be. There's no new annual pass offering (wonder why? although I saw through that last year), linear progression is back, if you worked at it long enough in 5.0-5.1 you would be in in full BIS+6, and they are going to continue to gate certain gains only casual players would need behind reputation. PvP gear will never reach ilvl requirements for the next tier, too. If you unsub for a few months, you're going to start almost where you left off when you return. The real answer is Keep You Logged In. You know what? When I started playing back in Classic, this was the message up until T7. I don't understand the business model at this point however. <br />
<br />
They've long since destroyed the playerbase that was around in Classic and TBC (those people moved on to other games or other endeavors) who would relish such a system, today's players cannot be asked to do anything beyond current raid tier. Adding flavor to the game is looked at as nothing more than &quot;required content&quot; among the new hardcore group - who yesteryear would be nothing more than serious players. I do hope their decision to do this works out for the best given very few people today are like me who enjoy being given new things to do in the game, only to have a very vocal group of people come down with the &quot;NOT FUN&quot; hammer.</div></div><hr />
