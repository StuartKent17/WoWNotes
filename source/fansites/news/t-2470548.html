I can go make 20 WoD drums that still work and have no cooldown in 5-10 minutes by hearthing to my garrison and skinning in Draenor. The mallet having no cooldown wouldn't have been gamebreaking and instead just a nice little boost to prevent me having to skin in old zones at all. No idea what they were thinking with this one.</div></div><hr />

As a blacksmith, those &quot;tools of the trade&quot; sound pretty... no, VERY underwhelming, to be honest. The &quot;indestructible&quot; affix is practically useless, and making it a &quot;chance&quot; makes it even worse.<br />
<br />
And one-hour cooldown on repairing ONE piece of equipment? Yeah, that's nice... what about the other eight pieces of gear on my character that need repair? I'll still have to see a repair NPC. Yes, it'll lower the price of repair bills... but by a negligible amount, considering the amount of gold the game currently throws at you. As for the other items:<br />
<br />
The Leatherworking item looks ridiculous, since it prevents you from benefiting from ACTUAL bloodlust/heroism/time warp.<br />
<br />
The Jewelcrafting one looks alright, to be honest, though I never felt the need to remove a socketed gem, really.<br />
<br />
The Enchanting item looks interesting. Extra enchanting mats is never a bad thing.<br />
<br />
The Alchemy one looks... weird? &quot;Transmute the sphere into another object&quot;? What object? What effects would it gain? Is it random?</div></div><hr />

The hammer being able to repair one piece of gear once an hour is pretty OP and sounds like way too much fun. It'll get nerfed quickly.<br />
<br />
it is a nice like 100g or something saved per use if used on weapon, but its not as good as the others...<br />
would be nice if with it you had a higher chance for your crafted gear to warforge/titanforge too... speaking it is a titan item.<br />
engineerring one is just shit, it does literally nothing other then &quot;can summon some shitty minions to help you do world quests&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
but really alot of these seem like things mostly to help profession alts and not your main char.</div></div><hr />

2/4 classes that would pick up leatherworking? mind filling me in on these classes?<br />
cause i seem to remember 4 mail users and 2 leather users, and im abit confused why you only say 4.<br />
also not all hunters have the bloodlust pet, so its more 1.5/6<br />
<br />

also i have met many people who are leather working in cloth, or plate slots, simply for other reasons.</div></div><hr />

You wanna alleviate the issue? Make them as useful as they were in Wrath, Cata and MoP.<br />
<br />
Leg Armors for Leatherworkers.<br />
<br />
JCs barely craft gems anymore because you decided to go full RNG on sockets in your quest to force RNG on whatever you can in the game. <br />
<br />
Shoulder Inscriptions.<br />
<br />
Spellthread for Tailors.<br />

The BS one is literally a fucking Anvil.<br />

The JC one is something that should have been in the damn game since BC.<br />

&quot;We want professions to mean something&quot;<br />
&quot;Lets let everyone use 2 crafting professions, and ALL THREE GATHERING PROFESSIONS&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Professions should mean something&quot;<br />
&quot;Lets give everyone 5-6 of the 11 professions&quot;<br />

So proffs are still worthless and Alchemy remains the only one that’s beneficial. Why are they wasting resources on this trash?<br />

BRING BACK PROFESSION PERKS<br />
<br />
Perks were bloody awesome. Skinning increasing your crit, Herbalism had a nice buff for healers with the mini heal and Haste and so on.<br />
<br />
There's literally no reason to have any profession these days except Alchemy and maybe Enchanting. Although even enchants are quite cheap.<br />
<br />
The game throws gear at you so most of the crafted stuff is worthless, the Darkmoon Trinkets have been worthless for some time, the alchemist stones are garbage and so on.<br />
<br />
And as for JC. Considering they took a feature that was guaranteed on gear and made it RNG because they seem to have an obsession with it as of late even JC is worthless unless RNG decides to be kind. Whereas pre WoD we had coloured sockets which was fine.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts also. I'm thinking about the champion equipments also, so many mats and gold involved, and the results are underwhelming by a large margin. I don't get what the fuck is going through their mind when they design it like that. The past expansions were better in that regard. For example, I'm trying a private MoP server atm, and I'm amazed how better the game feels compared to BfA. And I was surprised to find lots of people coming from retail to try this. Which shows that this is not only my own opinion.</div></div><hr />

Because everyone would get 10 professions on their character, while only a minority has 10 high level alts to get all the professions. See, for you it doesn't make a difference, because you have those chars and profs already, but to the population as a whole, it would make a HUGE difference.</div></div><hr />

Have to agree on this the amount of mats I had to get start of expansion while everything was crazy prices only to find out that fish finder does not actually find fish. Been playing since launch and in all this time i have received crappy 5-10 fish all of 4 times total.</div></div><hr />

If you look at them in a vacuum, yeah, they're a little, minor present for free.<br />
<br />
However, when you look at the bigger picture, and realize just HOW MUCH they removed from professions, this hardly feels like even consolation.<br />
<br />
It's like as if your ISP company decided to heavily limit your download quota, your upload quota, and how fast you can download/navigate during work hours... but some time down the line they say to you: &quot;hey, neildown, how about a 'little, minor present for free' for you, eh? We're increasing your download quota by 10%!&quot;<br />

Sadly, it's this thought process that resulted in class homogenization and removal of RPG elements from the game.<br />
<br />
I feel that if it weren't for PvP, this wouldn't have been as big of an issue.<br />

And yes, you can specc whatever you want in Classic and still reach the endgame and can take on Dungeons even in absolute garbage speccs. We don't even have the choice to make a sub-optimal build anymore. We are FORCED to be a certain way with little choice. RPG games are about choices, good and bad ones.

<br />
I am talking about MEANINGFUL decisions, if a decision like a profession does not affect your character it is pointless, might as well give everyone all benefits. First of all, the gathering professions should be baseline like Fishing and Cooking. There is no reason to limit it and it would allow ALL crafting professions to use all materials instead. Obviously leather working still would require more leather etc. It kinda worked like that in Classic and every profession was interconnected in regards to materials. Then, I would limit each character to 1 profession instead of 2, so you are reliant on others more often. Crafting mats would be crafted and then traded through the trading window instead of being a &quot;go AH and buy it all&quot;. Yes, &quot;forcing&quot; people to be social when crafting is a good idea. In general forcing people to interact with eachother in a MMO is favorable. The only thing you would be able to buy in regards to materials would be the raw mats like ore, herbs etc. You need ingots? Find a blacksmith to make them for you. Products of crafting need to be attached to characters, not just bought in an anonymous channel.<br />
<br />
Then, to finally make professions meaningful, each profession should have a designated role. Yes, blacksmithing would be the obvious choice for plate and mail wearers because it would boost their performance directly through polishing of weapons and/or armor, think of them like extra enchantments. At the same time you keep Enchanting relevant because it will allow basic enchantments to be used if you DONT have blacksmithing as plate wearer. Enchanting itself could have potent magically scrolls that only you can use to boost your damage for 20% similar to heroism. Now enchanting would also be a good choice for plate DPS wearers. This goes on and on, and I am not gonna explain every profession in detail. I easily demonstrated that you can have obvious choices (for people just wanting to casually have a bonus) and actual choices where you min/max your character. Currently, professions have no obvious choice and no actual choice. They are all meaningless and dull.</div></div><hr />

Silus' Sphere of Transmutation turns into one of 4 random items:<br />
<br />
Silus' Phial of Perpetual Potential: a reusable Coastal Healing Potion.<br />
(Item #167742): a costume item, similar to the Coin of Many Faces (except non-player models).<br />
Silus' Stone of Transportation: summons an interactable eye, which allows you to teleport to any npc hub in your current zone.<br />
Silus' Potion of Luck: increases the proc chance of your Rank 3 BfA alchemy craftables for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
So the alchemy one is better. While the profession is already objectively superior to everything else. My entire account, all toons, all of them alchemist ebcause it's the only profession that gives something. I don't give a flying fuck about making gold, gold is almost useless we already have too much of it and just doing the bare minimum gives enough to pay for anything you need. I want professions to give something unique, change the gameplay, like you know, what it should be in a RPG.<br />

Really leatherworking ability is drums. 2/4 Class that would pickup leatherworking already can cast a better version. Who in the right mind is developing overthere.<br />
<br />
People who don't play the game. Look at this fucking garbage piece of shit that lets you unsocket a gem. IT COSTS LIKE 30G, WHO GIVES A SHIT? The ONLY WAY to think an item like that would make sense is if you have absolutely no idea how meaningless buying a gem actually is.<br />
<br />
You need to NOT PLAY THE GAME to design something that fucking bad.<br />

Blizzard needs to hire WoW players, not the mobile &quot;gamers&quot; they have now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casperite</div><div class="date">2019-03-06, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They all suck, indeed. The problem is, that Blizzard does not want to have &quot;mandatory&quot; professions that are clearly superior for class/specc X and thus make them all generic boring snooze-fest. WoW has long forgotten that it's a RPG game. Most GOOD RPG games have imbalanced combinations that make you feel overpowered. And instead of making sure every class feels overpowered now and then, they make everything and everyone feel generic and dull. RPG and over the top balance never results in a fun game. Classic wasn't balanced, but it was way more fun and had exciting professions and class balance. The only real balance for a RPG game is, that you make sure the weakest possible choice is still viable. If a choice / combination is not viable then you remove it from the game or make it stronger.<br />
<br />
And yes, you can specc whatever you want in Classic and still reach the endgame and can take on Dungeons even in absolute garbage speccs. We don't even have the choice to make a sub-optimal build anymore. We are FORCED to be a certain way with little choice. RPG games are about choices, good and bad ones. You just make sure bad choices can still play the game for the most part.<br />
<br />
So you think that WoW would be better with purposeful imbalances?</div></div><hr />

However, when you look at the bigger picture, and realize just HOW MUCH they removed from professions, this hardly feels like even consolation.<br />

It's like as if your ISP company decided to heavily limit your download quota, your upload quota, and how fast you can download/navigate during work hours... but some time down the line they say to you: &quot;hey, neildown, how about a 'little, minor present for free' for you, eh?

That's not to mention how lackluster ajnd downright dumb some of those powers are, like the leatherworking item's weak, malnourished version of Heroism/Bloodlust/Time Warp.<br />

Go a little further: If the professions are only going to offer flavor rewards, then why not just let one character have all the professions? Is it really that beneficial to the game that I log on and off 10 characters a day to exhaust all my profession cooldowns? Why not just let me learn them all on one guy and save the 9 login attempts for the server?<br />

One of the two leatherworking item's powers really is a &quot;weak, malnourished version of Heroism/Bloodlust/Time Warp.&quot; When 50% of the item is a carbon-copy of something the leatherworking can ALREADY create, at much cheaper cost, with easier-to-acquire materials, to the point of becoming irrelevant, then yes, it does make the item itself &quot;lackluster&quot;.<br />

I'll be honest. I think it's cool that other profs get shit, but i'm pretty salty that gathering profs don't get anything. They can't say the benefit of gathering profs is money, because you can buy my materials and make more money (in some cases). So it would be nice to get cool shit for mining/herb/skinning too.</div></div><hr />

This was already answered. We had a decent professions system in Legion, they scrapped it to shit in BfA and now they add some items that are meh at best (IMO). Balance is still negative like with every other feature of BfA compared to Legion except War Mode (pretty good idea, horribly managed). This is why many people complain, game is much worse now than a year ago and a cherry on the top of a turd won't transform it into a cake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
So you think that WoW would be better with purposeful imbalances?<br />
<br />
I'd say you are looking at OP's post with a reductionist view, he's trying to say &quot;imbalances&quot; diversify the game play. So lets create an old school example for hunters with engineering. Goblin Engineering gets a shotgun which has two burst shots, with a reload time and dealing more damage the closer you are to the target. Gnomish engineering allows you to summon a few craftable pets each with different abilities (spiderbot, respawning bomb bot, whatever). Both dramatically change your play style even down to gearing. Haste stacking for your gnomish pets cooldowns and attack speed. Crit and pure damage stacking for shotgunning for further burst. It even extends beyond that, you might have earlier gearing favour crit stacking because your base damage is low but later on you want the haste because your base has increased. Or shotgunning gobbo hunters are favourable for burst pvp meta because they just disengage into a target and double barrel them. Gnomish pvp is about kiting and having your pets annoy.<br />
<br />
This is just one profession with one specfic class in mind, yet Blizzard can't bother to do this stuff anymore. Quirky stuff like this increases the options. Sure people will min max but if you change the function it means you don't need to worry so much about min maxing because you have filled a niche. You can even balance certain things so they ramp up later in the season/expansion and increase the variation in gameplay as your progress through a season. I remember back in tbc, Warlocks would go a basic affliction spec with shadow damage and hit stacking. Then once SSC and TK were on the cards getting to hit cap was simple so you switched builds to a destro crit build.<br />
<br />
This is why people complain the game is lacking these days, sure the tuning is much tighter but the actual direct gameplay is lacking. Imagine if the twin pipe buster cannon from mekkatorque was the goblin shotgun I suggested. Now imagine almost every weapon in the game having an interesting design, sure certain ones would rise to the top but then you just buff out the others so they match. That's how every gaming services wants to balance things, except Blizzard who are happy with turning everything into basic stat bumps or dumps so they can just throw them into a spreadsheet. Even looking at the TBC Blacksmithing patterns as a case study of how to have fun but also bad balancing (stormherald I'm looking at you) the game used to have much more variation and that has sadly been lost to an almost unrewarding grind. Grinding out mats felt like crap but it was always gave you some reward in the end because you were making something. Now it's either a non-reward or a roll of the dice (titanforging and legendary items).<br />
<br />
That's why people are clamouring for the game play of old.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tl;dr Blizzard can have interesting and specific designs (even unintended ones) while also balancing it, instead of just having everything be part of a simple excel spreadsheet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still making drums from the thousands of Legion mats that didn't sell, I've only made the BfA ones for the Azerite quest turn-ins. If anything, this Mallet item should just have a 5min or 10min CD as a perk to the Leatherworker, as you'll still be carrying around stacks of drums because this item has a ridiculously long cooldown (and the tooltip wording implies only the LWer would get the buff, which I hope is a misstatement). Yes, it has a buff component, but it sounds suspiciously like a outdoor-only type of buff where you interact with something in the word for a temporary buff. Regardless, this doesn't make Leatherworking relevant at all.<br />
<br />
As some others have stated, WoW crafting has be pretty much irrelevant for a long time outside of a few outlying professions. The irony is that most armor crafting professions only feed or making the other professions easier, instead of being their own unique thing. Quite a few professions are at the level of First Aid right now. If you've seen the crafting professions in ESO and FF14, you'd understand how completely terrible and how lacking in depth WoW professions really are.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;indestructible&quot; affix is practically useless, and making it a &quot;chance&quot; makes it even worse.<br />
<br />
And one-hour cooldown on repairing ONE piece of equipment? Yeah, that's nice... what about the other eight pieces of gear on my character that need repair? I'll still have to see a repair NPC. Yes, it'll lower the price of repair bills... but by a negligible amount, considering the amount of gold the game currently throws at you. As for the other items:<br />
<br />
The Leatherworking item looks ridiculous, since it prevents you from benefiting from ACTUAL bloodlust/heroism/time warp.<br />

The Jewelcrafting one looks alright, to be honest, though I never felt the need to remove a socketed gem, really.<br />

The Enchanting item looks interesting. Extra enchanting mats is never a bad thing.<br />

I could properly have saved close to 100k if I had that one from the start.<br />
And when you sim your chars at some point on some classes secondaries switch around. That's roughly 1k gold per gemmed slot (your server prices may vary)<br />

You have to be a jewelcrafter to have the JC's &quot;tool of the trade&quot; item, and if you're Jewelcrafter, you're more than likely have uncut gems in your gem bag, so there is no real loss of gold, there. It'd be nice if you could remove gems from other people's gear, though.<br />
<br />
I also wonder what's the cooldown on the item's 'use' feature is.<br />
