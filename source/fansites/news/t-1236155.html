Patch 5.1 BMAH Additions<br />
Patch 5.1 added three new items to the BMAH. The first is a weapon with a fairly unique model, the Sun-Lute of the Phoenix King (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44924-sun-lute-of-the-phoenix-king)! The on use effect turns you in to Sig Nicious (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/23626-sig-nicious#related:screenshots).<br />
<br />
It has a reported starting bid of 70k, the same as the Arcanite Ripper (http://www.wowdb.com/items/39769-arcanite-ripper). You can find a full list of the items on the BMAH here (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-source=128).<br />

<br />
The other two items are old Proto-Drakes. The first is the Reins of the Plagued Proto-Drake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44175-reins-of-the-plagued-proto-drake), which was a reward of Glory of the Raider (10 player) (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2137-glory-of-the-raider-10-player). The other is the Reins of the Rusted Proto-Drake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/45802-reins-of-the-rusted-proto-drake), a reward of Glory of the Ulduar Raider (10 player) (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2957-glory-of-the-ulduar-raider-10-player).<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
On a related note: Do you still feel that number changes are preferable over mechanical changes for all specs during an XP?<br />
Ya. More players quit because of constant class changes than quit because of balance concerns. Hard to believe maybe but true. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272796727264821248))<br />
<br />
But GC in all fairness we have other classes standing up for us, its not us shamans vs the world<br />
Also &quot;my warrior alt agrees with my shaman main.&quot; See the problem? That's not the same as an actual discussion with back and forth from both sides. Players never agree 100% with anything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/271000230349135873))<br />
Yo GC, try and show some respect to your playerbase /cast Busshock<br />
I respect our players a great deal or I wouldn't make such an effort to do this. That does not mean game design is up for a vote. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/271389535114502144))<br />
<br />
Why the huge nerf to glyphs in MoP? They seem, well, underwhelming. #wow<br />
They were a DPS increase before, but not an interesting one. Most players picked the highest DPS glyph and never changed them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269498538306727937))<br />
<br />
Do you think abilities such as Destro Rain of Fire or Halo should break Rogue's stealth? And if so why? It's too easy to break<br />
I would love to see only Flare and a few others break stealth, but that's a potentially destabilizing change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/271389245829181442))<br />
<br />
Have you ever considered changing a spec from a pure dps class to a tank/heal spec?<br />
yes, but I don't think every one of those pure players would like that (&amp; you can't just say they can ignore the new roles). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272428280299286528))<br />
With druids now having 4 specs to choose from, wouldn't it be possible to add them&amp;not remove any specific spec?<br />
Druids have always been hybrids though. Maybe a rogue doesn't want to have to be considered a tank. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272439587668889600))<br />
I dont think most people would have to consider it. I assume if your in a raid you have a designated tank.<br />
Not that simple. If you have a tank as a class might be less room for DPS of same class. Also has gear, DPS, dual spec implications. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272795780568469504))<br />
<br />
some classes/specs does not bring anything useful generally, hunters rogues come to mind these problems -continued<br />
We don't like balancing around awesome raid utility - just shifts the problem to who has strongest utility. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272794006046523392))<br />

Â¨What do you think of DK survival in pvp? I quit mine because I realized in premop patch that we were going to be easy target<br />
If you can get a DK to blow all def cooldowns, then they're easier to kill, but you still have Blood Presence. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270698313731420160))<br />
<br />
Why is Blood getting nerfed PvP wise? We have no mobility what so ever.. we are easily kited.WTF. Compensate for the nerf?<br />
We don't like invulnerable tanks in PvP even if they are slow. Blood had too much self-healing in PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272798232336297984))<br />

I'm not sure why you just don't throw a 1 min CD on Healing Shrooms and scale them properly and be done with it at this point.<br />
that might get druids to use them, but that makes them like a lot of other spells and the game needs more variety not less. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270998128243666944))<br />
why not have mushroom healing to be increased based on a proc you receive by using another spell, like regrowth, etc<br />
potentially. Want to be a little careful not to add too many RNG procs though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272440424889716737))<br />
<br />
How long are we going to have to wait to see shifting out of snares removed?<br />
Not on our radar ATM. We don't want to nerf every counter in PvP, just the ones that feel super frustrating. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272430621677219840))<br />

Is there a possible warlock-style redesign for hunters in future? New talents seem to cause button bloat and spread dps thin.<br />
We don't think hunters need a massive revamp (beyond range and ammo changes they already have). They do have too many buttons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270994899179040768))<br />
<br />
Regarding hunters, why is BW, a skill untouched for years suddenly OP? Also 5.1 changes nothing regarding MM being weak in pvp<br />
We don't think defenses used offensively makes good gameplay. They tend to get blown immediately not strategically. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272793055759831041))<br />

Any chance Mages could get rune of power castable on the move?<br />
Don't want it to be a buff you just hit on cooldown. Agree it needs a little work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272440268815466496))<br />
Any word on IW or Invocation?<br />
Invocation works for Arcane, but feels too maintenancy for others. IW is a bigger topic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272798021610266625))<br />

Hey GC with the change in 5.1 making totems act as spells was it intended to nerf all specs or just resto ?<br />
it was intended as a nerf to totems. Now that they do things (not just buffs) they were hard to counter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270996107214086144))<br />

How's the banner experiment working out? Have you guys contemplated any other cool banner style abilities for warriors?<br />
honestly, not sure yet. Still like the concept. Not sure if it's delivering on the fantasy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270997247804727296))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
When you or one of the blizzard staff mentioned the 30% healing nerf in Battlegrounds, I hope you mean hybrids only.<br />
Nope. We suspect healing overall is too potent once burst is toned down. You shouldn't need to 100% CC a healer to score a kill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272795074658721792))<br />
<br />
Make PvP abilities a mod to PvE abilities = PvP changes isolated. Add PvP Stance for equipment/glyphs, fallback to PvE gear.<br />
We make abilities work differently as a later sort, but I for one don't want to have to earn two different rule sets. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272425998421741568))<br />
greg making two rule sets is the only way to fix the PVE vs PVP issue. have you not learned that yet?<br />
Disagree. Also even if true, perfect balance gains us nothing if a bunch of players leave because the rules are inscrutable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272439999918661633))<br />
<br />
A flightless Tol Barad-type zone is essential for world pvp. Do you regret not making one for MoP or plan to make one?<br />
We had done those zones 2 expansions in a row so felt it was time to let it rest a bit, but I bet we try them again in the future. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270699162885050368))<br />
<br />
Why are the PvP achievements so limited? No 2,4k in 2v2. No 1k arenas won? 5k arenas won? Hot Hot Hot streak? #possibilities<br />
We'd like to add more but we need to make sure they don't encourage strange behavior. Ach farming in PvP can get silly fast. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272064431565971456))<br />
<br />
I believe an open mind is more important than a title, experience after that. Sadly, even glads can be very biased.<br />
People who like to eat don't always make good cooks. That doesn't mean they can't tell you what they like to eat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270634467075432449))<br />
Do you take advice from a master chef or some guy who just happens to enjoy food?<br />
Both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270639431193595904))<br />
<br />
So why nerf all specs? Reducing the benefit of mastery in PvP would fix resto, but ele isn't even viable pre-nerfs.<br />
We don't think it's all about the healing, and Resto PvE healing is fine. We think totems are too good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270636187406983168))<br />
people will stop complaining about resto pvp nerfs if you nerf frost bomb/ warrior cd stacking/ resto drood control<br />
There are mage and warrior nerfs in 5.1. Keeping an eye on Cyclone for now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270639391641325568))<br />
<br />
I'm not giving up on skirmish arenas, never, ever. You know we want it. inb4 block :&lt;<br />

<br />
Everyone agrees with him/her. This upgrade gear thing is going to make people quit the game. PvP is dying.<br />
claiming to speak for everyone always makes me suspicious. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272426170467901441))<br />
well, not everyone but the majority i think. btw, i would love to have that pvp forum on the US.<br />
just make good arguments and don't worry about invoking a huge crowd to agree with you. It's not a vote anyway. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272428563955871744))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
MoP was meant to get people out in the world, PvP was supposed to be king this xpac. Why nerf guild perk Quick and the Dead?<br />
dying is supposed to have some penalty. Since you have unlimited lives, downtime is the main one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270997006443479041))<br />
<br />
You ruined the joke just like you ruined Age of Empires and WoW...<br />
Changes no one asked for - Rpg home city. Homogenic empires and Clunky/Bad combat. Quite similar to WoW now<br />
.you don't get good games by just giving people what they ask for. Game design isn't just polling. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270987338077835264))<br />
Look at League of Legends Mr. Street, I'm sure it'd love to beg to differ.<br />
we're friends with all those guys. Pretty sure they don't turn over design to their community either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270997459352825856))<br />
<br />
What happened to balance/bug fix patches (eg 4.0.6)? It's frustrating to wait for next content patch to see much desired fixes<br />
We don't characterize patches that way. There are big patches (new raid tier / PvP season) and smaller ones. 5.1 is the latter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270627988394102786))<br />
<br />
But there is something to be said about testing your games.<br />
we do test our games. We have a huge QA department and we invite players to try out betas and PTRs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270996607980404736))<br />
<br />
just curious... do you collaborate w/ the other blizzard games, or does everyone stay in their own game areas?<br />
We collaborate a fair amount. Great to get outside opinions and see how others solve problems. Several temp or perma moves too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270988301257826305))<br />
<br />
Regarding items that aren't intended to ever go into the game (i.e. heroic raid trash), why are they made? Just curious.<br />
if we change loot tables late, then we already have the items ready. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270295563981971456))<br />
<br />
... what to listen to, consciuously or not. You reap the results of that (horrible PVP, constant whines).<br />
I read the role and PvP forums regularly. Feedback is always valuable. It just doesn't always result in immediate change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269498917949935617))<br />
<br />
You need to listen to the people who play this game even more than the ones who created it.<br />
We do listen to them. We just don't let them order up game changes on their own. That would be interesting though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270633041913856003))<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere we can beg an audience with The GC with a longer character limit?<br />
I'd love to in a theoretical sense, but there are too many of you and one of me. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/268764372531306496))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/december/ssdgraph.gif) seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte. A few sales have even gone under 50 cents per gigabyte, so look for something on sale! No new CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before late in the first or the second quarter next year.<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />

That's not what it ment. It was previously unobtainable since the boss was removed after Wrath launched.<br />

One of those Proto Drakes is still obtainable, why put them on the AH?<br />
<br />
Oh, and Blizzard are dodging the quest about Shaman Totems. They were already easy to counter - you could kill them in a single hit. Now they are twice as easy to counter! If you're going to turn them into spells, remove the totem altogether and only keep it for Searing and Magma totems.</div></div><hr />

There's already mounts that appear on the BMAH that are obtainable in game (White Polar Bear, White Hawkstrider, Mimiron's Head, etc.), disappointed about Plagued Proto-Drake (10 man) but no Black Proto-Drake (25 man).</div></div><hr />

Way too overdramatic reaction for such trivial bullshit. But then again, most reactions around here are overdramatic by nature, it's no surprise. <br />
<br />
Yeah, it's absolutely disgusting and infurating that other players can obtain items that were removed years ago, even though it has no effect on MY gameplay at all! How dare they do this! /sarcasm<br />
<br />
If you can't see how freaking small and harmless it is that a handful of people are going to have a mount/vanity weapon that isn't obtainable anymore, then I can do nothing more than laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I surely wouldn't spend much gold on the plagued drake. If it was the black one, however... I'd invest quite a bit on that one. But not on the plagued.<br />
<br />
As for the weapons, it's a no for me. Even if I did have the monetary power to get them, I don't think they're worth large amounts of gold. But that's just me, and it really means little.<br />
<br />

I think that they could've made it as rare drop from something. Rare npc that have spawn time like TLPD, and only 5% chance on dropping Plagued and Black Proto Drakes. It should spawn in Orgrimmar and Stormwind AH of course.<br />

Sure I would. You're assuming I wasn't ever in a similar situation as you are. Perhaps not with the same items. Perhaps not even with some super-hard to obtain shiny (which the plagued drake and the arcanite ripper WERE NOT), perhaps not even in this game. But I have been, and I never cared. You assume too much.<br />
<br />
All I can really say is: you poor little thing, having to share your precious mount with people who put in less effort than you did YEARS ago. Do you cry about people who solo or 2-3 man their way to their meta-achievement/rare drop mount from previous expansions just because they aren't obtaining them in current content? I'm sure you do.</div></div><hr />

Because the T7 10 man meta was MEGA HARD, amirite? I mean, it's not like a bunch of guilds cleared Naxx still wearing T6 or anything, right? You worked so hard, you poor baby.<br />

You act like suddenly, tomorrow, there are going to be 3495783985793874598357 people on your realm with a plagued proto, just like, flying circles around you. That's not going to happen. You can stop hyperventilating.<br />
<br />
Also the Arcanite Ripper was not an item you had to &quot;work for&quot;....it was a drop off a special event boss that was piss easy, as special even bosses tend to be, and if you were a lucky little girl like me you won the roll. I don't care if more people have the same axe I do, because it's super awesome no matter what.<br />

<br />
I'd agree with you, if not for the fact that buying gold isn't really something endorsed by Blizzard, or a lot of us players for that matter. Buying gold is, for all intents and purposes, as bad as exploiting. Obtaining enough gold for these vanity items in a legit way will take enough effort to warrant the mount's availability as a gold sink. And even ignoring for a moment their cost, it's not like these mounts will be up on the BMAH 24/7, all the time, always available. You won't suddenly have a mob of players riding on plagued proto-drakes because of this. Just like you don't have mobs of players riding other rare drop mounts that are on the BMAH since it was released.<br />
<br />
Still, I'll give you my opinion. It really doesn't matter. Those &quot;rewards&quot; are outdated. VERY outdated. They should have never been removed in the first place (except perhaps the arcanite ripper, I'll give you that one, since it was a one-time thing like the tabard of the protector, and not a whole raid/dungeon reward by itself, that was available for months), just like every mount after those weren't removed (exception being the ToC mounts, sadly). Content - be it dungeons themselves or specific items from them - should never, in my opinion, be removed, for the sole reason that those people who think themselves &quot;worthy&quot; of having exclusive items that no one else can touch, will always have their own up-to-date rewards that no one else will be able to touch for at least an entire expansion. <br />
Every new tier, you get new status symbols that make you stand out from other people around you. Why then, shouldn't other players be able to more easily access older &quot;prestige&quot; rewards, when you're getting between two to three new ones every tier, that the vast majority of the population can't touch? How is that such a problem?</div></div><hr />

So maybe 1-3 of them are available per year, per server - whatever, it will still be rare.... and I will always have the satisfaction of beating one of the most difficult hard modes in WotLK - OS3D 10 man in Naxx gear...with the time stamp on the achievement to prove it.</div></div><hr />

Buying gold is, for all intents and purposes, as bad as exploiting. Obtaining enough gold for these vanity items in a legit way will take enough effort to warrant the mount's availability as a gold sink. And even ignoring for a moment their cost, it's not like these mounts will be up on the BMAH 24/7, all the time, always available. You won't suddenly have a mob of players riding on plagued proto-drakes because of this. Just like you don't have mobs of players riding other rare drop mounts that are on the BMAH since it was released.<br />
<br />
Still, I'll give you my opinion. It really doesn't matter. Those &quot;rewards&quot; are outdated. VERY outdated. They should have never been removed in the first place (except perhaps the arcanite ripper, I'll give you that one, since it was a one-time thing like the tabard of the protector, and not a whole raid/dungeon reward by itself, that was available for months), just like every mount after those weren't removed (exception being the ToC mounts, sadly). Content - be it dungeons themselves or specific items from them - should never, in my opinion, be removed, for the sole reason that those people who think themselves &quot;worthy&quot; of having exclusive items that no one else can touch, will always have their own up-to-date rewards that no one else will be able to touch for at least an entire expansion. <br />
Every new tier, you get new status symbols that make you stand out from other people around you. Why then, shouldn't other players be able to more easily access older &quot;prestige&quot; rewards, when you're getting between two to three new ones every tier, that the vast majority of the population can't touch? How is that such a problem?<br />
<br />
I suppose that's where our opinions differ, where my opinion is that if you've earned something you should keep it. I'm not 100% for keeping items out of the game, but I'm more for the concept of having to put forward an equal amount of effort to gain an item. And farming a boss for 2 years doesn't count as &quot;effort&quot; in my brain - I'm more thinking of achievements which are like &quot;Kill all bosses in X raid at level Y with no higher item level than Z&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have new technology which allows the player to tone down their item level to a certain amount in challenge modes, this feature could surely be ported over somehow. If this happened, would you then be happy? No content is being removed (if anything it is saving more content, as players have to run the raid instead of just going to the BMAH), the effort required stays the same, and those who are hungry for epeen can get their mounts before anyone else at the same rate as per usual, meaning they have nothing to complain about.</div></div><hr />

If it was so easy to get, why should they bring it back? It's still one of the rarest mounts to have. Naxx wasn't hard by any means, but it was hard to get through all of the 25m encounters in a single lockout without anyone dying. And yeah, they shouldn't bring it back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So everyone that killed kael'thas back in BC should have a phoenix? Everyone who killed Mandokir back when ZG went live for the first time should get the raptor automatically? They put in as much effort as anyone else that killed it back then and got it. What about transitive difficulty? If one raid is harder than another, but the first raid drops a mount, should you get the mount from the first raid after having cleared the second? Or how about the dungeon drop mounts, like from stonecore or vortex pinnacle? I killed those bosses numerous times when they were &quot;current&quot; content, should my achievement earn me said mount?<br />
<br />
I could give a rat's ass if they bring back strictly cosmetic rewards, especially in an avenue in which so very, very few people will actually get it, like the black market auction house. I'm a mount hunter, and I ride mounts that look cool, not mounts that I think will make other people think I'm better than them.</div></div><hr />

LOL at the use of the term 'veteran' with a QQ over a WRATH mount.

<br />
Both the ironbound and rusted are still awarded by ulduar's meta achievements. The rusted on the BMAH is much like the cheap pets that Breanni puts there for 10k, it's there for high prices, but can still be obtained the normal way.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I would be fine with such a system. However, I doubt it would work very well for one reason. There is a reason why old content is visited so much, to the point of warranting changes to make some bosses soloable. People go there because they have fun farming old content and collecting drops (be it transmog sets, mounts, pets, transformation items, reputations, titles, the challenge of beating certain bosses solo, you name it). I, too, do this. It's one of the things I enjoy doing, especially when I have a friend or two with me. Doing such a scaling system &quot;blocking&quot; access to mounts would tremendously reduce old content usage, in my opinion, to the point where old content raids would once again become obsolete unless you were, again, in a guild capable enough to defeat these challenges. The whole purpose of old content farming is really &quot;easily smash through old content for cool looking cosmetic rewards&quot;, or in the case of people like Mionelol, doing harder solo challenges simply for the challenge of it. A scaling system, even if optional, would ruin many people's fun, at the cost of keeping vanity items unique for people who only want to have exclusivity. I wouldn't mind such a system, but it would surely screw up with some gameplay I consider fun, and many others do, as is evident.<br />
<br />
In the end, you and I have different opinions on this matter. And that's fine. It's only when people, like those I was originally quoting a few pages back, treat this trivial matter like it's an apocalypse and generally act like assholes, that it warrants a bit of arguing. I guess the two of us can just agree to disagree without issues :)</div></div><hr />

Selling something for absurd amounts of gold (thinking of the average player anyway), only promotes gold selling and buying. And if not that, to drive the economy up so much that you don't have a chance without becoming an &quot;AH baron&quot; yourself, which is silly.</div></div><hr />

The Scarab Lord Mount, sacred as people hold it, was SO overly easy by the time it was removed, that in one of the last gates about 1000 people were meant to have all got it. (thus speeding up its eventual removal)<br />
<br />
Both of these things are really about the time you happened to be a raider rather than having had more skill at the time than people do today. I don't see why things like &quot;The Immortal&quot; can't be applied to a NEW tier raid, which would have the exact same difficulty in getting the achievement as the first time it was out.</div></div><hr />

Care to explain how the Guardian Cub is not a Blizzard-authorized cash for gold option?<br />
<br />
1. Pay $10 for Guardian Cub<br />
2. Put Guardian Cub on Auction House for Gold.<br />
3. Collect gold. <br />

Perhaps some readers who are still playing can check their AH's and see how much gold $10 buys right now?</div></div><hr />

You know they will, it's only a matter of time. A change I like for many reasons. Raids have enough vanity items already for current tier raids. Though raiders refuse to see it because More &gt; Better. The only thing I personally feel should be &quot;Prestigious&quot; are world and server firsts. People want to do raids because they are &quot;Challenging&quot; and &quot;Fun&quot; content, not &quot;I want to do this so I can flaunt it when the items removed.&quot; <br />
<br />
That kind of attitude doesn't need rewarded and that coming from a person who's been playing since Classic and has played games since I was 5. Mounts should be removed from all &quot;Vanity&quot; or prestige rewards, if they NEED something that bad, just add on transmog gear for heroic raid rewards and remove the old tier rewards at the start of each new content patch.</div></div><hr />

What about transitive difficulty? If one raid is harder than another, but the first raid drops a mount, should you get the mount from the first raid after having cleared the second? Or how about the dungeon drop mounts, like from stonecore or vortex pinnacle? I killed those bosses numerous times when they were &quot;current&quot; content, should my achievement earn me said mount?<br />

I could give a rat's ass if they bring back strictly cosmetic rewards, especially in an avenue in which so very, very few people will actually get it, like the black market auction house.

Sarth was harder on 10 man than 25 man due to its design.. was much easier to use 'special' tactics on 25 man (I think on our first kill we used 4-5 tanks one of which was a Voidwalker, to do it.) Though I did do it on 10 man but was missing immortal (+ some others) so didn't get the drake!</div></div><hr />

I was really hoping that as far as mounts go, they'd keep it to stuff that was still available, even if a giant pain like Mim's Head at 1%. Who are you getting to continue playing this game Blizzard, by allowing one or two gold-capped toons a year the chance at a retired raid mount? For that handful of players that are pleased with this decision, I'm sure there is an offset of players (not saying I'm among them) that grow sick of the fact that nothing's sacred.</div></div><hr />

You probably have confused black and plagued proto drakes. Sarth 3D 25 man, which was required for black proto, was very easy. 10 man, which was required for plagued proto, was hard. Cockblock for black proto was Immortal, cockblock for plagued proto was Sarth 3d.<br />
<br />
There was no mechanic in Naxx 10 or 25 that was going to kill you if you weren't stupid or didn't horribly undergear the content by the time they removed the meta achievement rewards. Even if you were undergeared, all the dangerous mechanics but one in that entire zone were avoidable.<br />
<br />
Sarth 3D was always harder than Immortal or Undying on either difficulty.<br />
<br />
Edit: Though if there WAS a cockblock to Immortal it was Thaddius. Fuck you, stupid fucking fucks who can't tell be bothered to see if their charge changed and move accordingly. &gt;:[</div></div><hr />

Oh and the arcanite reaper, and tabard of the argent of dawn wasn't difficult to get, it just meant you had to be there at the right time with the right interest (and maybe a bit of luck for the reaper).<br />

My opinion on the &quot;special snowflake&quot; is that, if you do something cool in the game you can be that special snowflake for a few months... after which all bets are off.</div></div><hr />

Thing being if you were in his position how long would it be until you got to the stage where you didn't care anymore and would like to tell people where to go. He is only human and has feelings too and that having to put up with the rubbish he must receives from players complaining about this and that.

All I can really say is: you poor little thing, having to share your precious mount with people who put in less effort than you did YEARS ago. Do you cry about people who solo or 2-3 man their way to their meta-achievement/rare drop mount from previous expansions just because they aren't obtaining them in current content?
