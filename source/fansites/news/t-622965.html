US realms<br />
We will be performing an urgent maintenance on all realms beginning at 4:00 AM PST. We anticipate no more than three hours of downtime. This maintenance is designed to correct a very recent issue where players were able to obtain certain PvP items without paying the intended price. <br />
<br />
Once the maintenance concludes, players who obtained such items will notice them removed from their inventory. However. any tokens or arena/honor points spent on said gear will be appropriately refunded. <br />
<br />
We wanted to inform our players regarding today’s extended maintenance. We experienced an error that resulted in players being unable to retrieve in-game mail from the last 15 days. Once the error was discovered, we brought down the realms immediately and began working to address this problem, and have been doing so for the duration of the day. Our decision was to enable players to continue playing World of Warcraft before the opening of Wrath of the Lich King. Work would continue on addressing issues with the in-game mail while the realms were up. This is the plan that is currently in motion.<br />
<br />
The process from this point forward will be twofold:<br />
<br />
1. All items that were in a mail will be sent to characters in one or more messages depending on the amount of items the character had in the mail system.<br />
2. Gold from auction house sales or sent through mail will be sent in a separate mail.<br />
<br />
We are working to resolve this issue, and we will keep our players informed throughout this process. In the meantime, please do not create an in-game ticket or contact phone support for this issue – multiple mails will be sent returning your items and gold automatically. We greatly appreciate your patience during this time. <br />

<br />
&lt;script src=&quot;http://www.wowhead.com/widgets/power.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Wrath of the Lich King - Account upgrade &amp; US Client now available<br />
According to a few mails I got, the EU account upgrade (https://upgrade.wow-europe.com/installer/) is now available and players can start upgrading their account for Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
After succesfully upgrading your account, it will change into a &quot;Undefined Account type&quot; but considering that the link is directly from the WotLK installer ... We can assume it works. The page will probably be available for US players shortly, maybe after the maintenance ? (Note how I used &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;probably&quot;) <br />
<br />
Update - It seems that after a short while the account update status will change to reflect that you have indeed upgraded to a WotLK account. <br />
Update #2 - Available for US servers too (https://upgrade.worldofwarcraft.com/installer/index.xml?product=WLK&amp;locale=enUS&amp;trial=0&amp;promo=0) !<br />
Update #3 - It also looks like the US Downloader (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/download/clients/pc/InstallWoW.exe) for Wrath of the Lich King is available. <br />
<br />
<br />
US - Free Character Moves to New Realm! 11/10<br />
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to a brand new realm, Fizzcrank, to assist in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available starting on Monday, November 10 at 12:00PM PST, and is scheduled to run until Monday, November 24 at 12:00PM PST.<br />
<br />
In the event that these realms meet our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br />
<br />
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
We will continue to evaluate realms and add more free character moves as we feel they are needed.<br />
<br />
Source A (PvE) - Aggramar, Alexstrasza, Arygos, Blackhand<br />
Destination A (PvE) - Fizzcrank<br />

Blue posts<br />
That's probably the last batch of blue posts on the homepage before the release of WotLK the blue tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/) will be your new friend for the upcoming days. <br />
US Extended Maintenance 11/11 *Updated*<br />
We are continuing to address the issues with players being unable to access their in-game mail. The process will run for several more hours, and we will provide another update on when the servers will be playable within the next 2 hours. Thank you for your patience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12454681633-extended-maintenance-1111.html))<br />

11/10/08 - Hotfix - Not In My House<br />
Today we hotfixed the &quot;Not In My House (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=203)&quot; achievement to only require 2 kills rather than 10. The user interface will still display that 10 kills are required but the achievement will complete once 2 kills occur.<br />
<br />
After a client patch, the user interface will be corrected. <br />
<br />
Crafters personal buffs<br />
All crafters have their personal buffs too. Like ring enchants for enchanters or the unique shoulder enchants for those with inscription. They all have a special buff whether it's a crafting or gathering profession. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12454669560-hey-blizz--wheres-the-love-for-crafters.html))<br />
<br />
Tier 7 Armor Tokens<br />
Yes one of the tokens has 4 classes and two of the tokens have 3. However the tokens with 3 classes have a 30% drop rate and the token with 4 has a 40% drop rate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/19/12354807861-4-classes-share-the-same-armor-token.html))<br />
<br />
BoP crafted items<br />
It's entirely likely that there will be more BoP crafted items. What there won't be is &quot;I have to be a crafter for item X because it's the best thing ever!&quot; items. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/19/12454855550-clarificationno-more-bop-crafted-epic-armor.html))<br />
<br />
WotLK Upgrade on multiple accounts<br />
For each account that you want to access the new content like Northrend, each one will need to be upgraded with its own unique key code. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12454631499-wrath--will-i-have-to-buy-2.html))<br />
<br />
Is it thursday yet ??<br />
I just wanted to pop into this thread briefly to inform everyone that we are still working hard on Thursday and are making good progress, though it is still not Thursday as of yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12454549907-is-it-thursday-yet.html))</div></div><hr />

And at least the time and money put into certain professions won't see wasted now. While we may never have things like the FSW power again, it's still nice there will be some things.</div></div><hr />

To quote the loggon screen:<br />
<br />
<br />
This Wednesday there will be a scheduled maintenance. Please note that all European realms will be offline from 05.00 until 11:00. Paris time (CET).<br />
So no-one's going anywhere until the servers are back up. <br />
<br />
As for &quot;where did people get their WotLK keys?&quot;, some people pre-ordered and happened to get theirs a day early. Some work in shops and so got theirs early.</div></div><hr />

Order online from the right place and live in America, or just live somewhere in America where the 7-11(/any game store) employees CAN'T FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. Or don't care ;-) If you worked at a place and could take yours home, you'd do it!<br />

If you register your key now it shows up as Wrath? not like unidentified or w/e?, What happens if we enter our keys early and something screws up and we can't play release day? =O, Should we wait to enter them you think? Blizzard has a lot of issues going on.</div></div><hr />

Realms are all still down so nobody really knows for sure. You SHOULD still be able to play live if all you do is upgrade your account. If you download the client updater, I don't know how that will work tbh.<br />

You understand that your entering a UNIQUE key right, and that its quite simple for them to check the product id for that key and find out were that copy was shipped to? <br />

The servers are down, they have been all day. Did you read the news article you responded to, or just look for the first forum you could find to post in? And your plan wouldn't have worked anyhow, just because you can install the client doesn't mean you'll be able to create a death knight ahead of schedule.<br />

I just did. About 7 minutes after my order I got a call to verify my order. You do need a landline to verify your address, but you can provide a separate number for them to call you on. Be warned though, it cost $50 this way, you can get it at most places for $45 (Walmart seems to be selling them for $40). Finally, they will not ship you the box, instead they will open it for you at launch time and email you the key.<br />
<br />
Edit: The price may be cheaper once you factor in tax, depending on where you live (yea technically I have the responsibility to pay sales tax to the gov, but you won't tell, will you).</div></div><hr />

true but once the disc is in the box they have no way to look at the cd key.<br />
<br />
blizzard used several fabricators to press and package the game. then it goes through activisions distribution by the pallet. after that its sent to the different chains distribution warehouses and 3rd party game distributors that then send it to multitudes of smaller distributors then chains and then indipendent stores.<br />
<br />
so really with no serial number on the actual box itself it cant be tracked. the only thing they can track is to say cdkey 00001 throught 99999 went to x distributor. if that was a first level dist. like best buy then they are screwed. however most places have 1-2 middlemen before they even hit the store. <br />
<br />
even EB games/gamestop has 1 distributor before it gets to thier dist. warehouse. so once those 10 pallets are split up for distrubution to the 7 chain stores they supply its impossible to say what box went to what game chain. then once the chains get thier copies they split them all up again and send them to all their stores.<br />
<br />
no way at all to track it without opening the boxes. unless each case in the pallet is marked :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't know why Blizzard even bothers. They should simply let people buy the game 1 week before the content is unlocked. That way everyone that gets a copy early can log on and enjoy Northrend at the same time.<br />
<br />
btw, I expect those logging on at midnight EST to provide screen shots of overflowing boats/zeps..., along with whatever gnome decides to take a zep there instead of a boat.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;selection of servers&quot; is my entire battlegroup. Since I actually play on it inside BGs, I know all of them by memory. Get rolled by the various premades, you know which ones suck.<br />

Please note that Blizzard intends to introduce a centralized account system for various Blizzard online games in the future (the “Battle.net Account”). The Battle.net Account will replace your World of Warcraft Account (the “WoW Account”). The opening of the Battle.net Account will not incur any additional costs and will not influence your World of Warcraft play experience in any way.<br />
To upgrade your WoW Account, you must expressly accept that you may be required to open a Battle.net Account at some point in the future (the exact date is not yet fixed). If you do not accept this, you can still play World of Warcraft, but you cannot upgrade your account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
YES, just use google to find the correct EU .Torrent file (7.71GB size). Faster than waiting for a wow-europe link, I bet. I'm downloading it right now at 350-400 kB/s more or less. Tested and confirmed to be perfectly working, of course you need to buy the key to actually play (but you can download it to install AND patch the full game).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. You download the .Torrent file and install + patch it. Then you login and play Wow as you always did before. IF you want to level 70-&gt;80 and visit Northerend you MUST buy the key (boxed game). I am downloading the game to install it this afternoon, as I ordered the game on a web shop and they sent me the CD-key via mail (they're fanatics like us lol!).</div></div><hr />

I've bought my copy from an italian store. They offer you both a shipped version as well as a &quot;cd-key only&quot; version. In that case you do not pay the shipping costs and they send you the cd-key in your mailbox AND via SMS on your cell. phone. Amazing servce from addicted sellers I guess. If you need some help on that, send me a PM and I'll be happy to help you (well they're like other shops, just choose - click - addtocart - checkout - pay with visa/paypal).</div></div><hr />

8 Gig? Are you sure this isn't the 1st two games with it, too? If not, I'm wondering what I DID download since I only downloaded 1.9GB with that web-installer last night. It went all the way through to 100%, then gave me the option to play or upgrade my account online just like the DVDs do...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answer is... .drum rolls.... YES! That's why people are already installing/patching the game BEFORE midnight. to get some advantage over other players who will get the game later and/or install it AFTER midnight. A nice thing to avoid (maybe) the global flood to Northerend as soon as the clock dings 00.00 (*)<br />
<br />
Of course at 00.01 servers will go offline for at least 6-12 hours, I'll bet on it ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not feel bad for that. I already know/imagine that midnight will be one of those &quot;memorable&quot; days for Blizzard. Everyone will be there, hammering the finger on &quot;LOGIN&quot; button and/or flooding the harbors to visit Northerend. Servers/hardware will get a LOT of stress and I bet we will suffer as well, in tems of latency, lag, crashes, restarts/... I understand it and I'll have patience, even if it will require more than 1 day or 2 to fix. It's a *huge* event for all of them (Blizzard staff) and being a developer myself, I can just &quot;feel&quot; the tension and the fear of it :)<br />

You can install the WotLK client at this moment. There are people who got the discs early. You can upgrade your account. You are able to play current BC WoW (if the servers are up). You will not be banned. You will not be able to make a DK until 12 a.m. EST. You will not be able to go to Northrend until 12 a.m. EST.<br />
<br />
It's not like Blizzard is new to this. I'm sure they expected that people would get the game before the actual launch time. Why punish people for being excited to get the new game and want to install it? <br />
<br />
So, if you have the client/DVD, grats to you, go install now while there is downtime. Once you have it installed hopefully you will be able to log into the game. Now all you need to do wait until the server restarts at 12.</div></div><hr />

Be nice but I've not seen anything but speculation on that and local advertising, from Blizzard I only see: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/wowx2-midnight.xml<br />

Perhaps the meaning was lost - You are able to upgrade your account at this time, provided that everything works as intended.<br />
<br />
It was not intended to be as literal as what you made it out to be. My point was to address those stating that you would be banned or you can't play until 12 a.m. This is not the case, you can upgrade*, you can play*, you won't be shut out*.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Upgrade to WotLK and play of WoW subject to laws in your area, servers being up, your credit card working, you having enough gas in your car to make it to the store, the store being open, having a functioning computer, internet connection, gravity keeping you on the planet, extra-dimensional beings not abducting you, evil scientists stealing power to re-animate the dead, or any other unforeseen event.<br />

<br />
They are saying that because they do not want PST stores breaking street dates.<br />
<br />
There is no way they could stop a PST'er with WoTLK installed and account upgraded from entering at midnight EST if the servers are running wotlk.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Promark</div><div class="date">2008-11-12, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I confirmed that the Wrath of the Lich King content will be made available at midnight in your respective US time zone, which happens to occur first for those on the east coast - 9 p.m. pacific time. <br />
To me that means server time. It matters not what time zone you are in, you won't get the new content until 12 a.m. server time. The original statement was that everyone would be able to play at 12 EST. <br />
<br />
It says nothing about stores selling it. If they wanted a tighter reign on it being in hand before 12, then they would have made sure Amazon didn't ship them out until today or even tomorrow.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the stores have imposed the &quot;don't sell until 12&quot; mantra on themselves because 99% of game launches follow this rule and breaking this rule can result in fines or other consequence. This doesn't matter for LK because you can't access the content until they deem you able to. It's not like a console game where you have access the moment you pop the disc in your machine.<br />
<br />
I hope that in the future when it comes to X-packs, they (game sellers) won't be so adamant on not selling it until 12, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />
