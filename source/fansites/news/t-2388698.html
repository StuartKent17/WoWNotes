Invenglobal Battle for Azeroth Dev Interview<br />
Invenglobal (https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/4755/explore-claim-resources-and-battle-for-your-faction-world-of-warcraft-interview) sat down with the WoW developers for a quick interview. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
All content is scaling down at the same ratio for the stat squish so soloing old content should not be affected.<br />
Azerite Power will be acquired in much the same way as Artifact Power.<br />
The art team was super excited to design the Horde and Alliance sets for Warfronts.<br />
The team wants to have a bunch of different raid encounter designs so that classes that excel at certain things have a chance to shine, but they also don’t want to have people excluded from raids.<br />
The team likes WoW to be available to those who have low end computers, but there comes a time when they have to up minimum specs purely to keep the game going.<br />
Changing old zones is a double edged sword as they don’t want to mess with player nostalgia.<br />
New classes are added when it makes sense for the story of the expansion.<br />
The team does not want racials to stop them from creating new races nor do they want people to play a race that they don’t want to just because it has the best racials.<br />
There is nothing to announce on whether or not Vulpera and Tortollans will be Allied Races.<br />
Lore-wise, G’huun is much less powerful than a real Old God, but the fight is going to be challenging.<br />
Warfronts have UI elements to help with resource gathering. They are not RTS, but very much World of Warcraft with RTS inspiration.<br />
The team wants to tell a story where it isn’t black and white who started the conflict.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hazelnuttygames Battle for Azeroth Dev Interview<br />
Hazelnuttygames (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep2OUD0W2CA) sat down with the WoW developers for a quick interview. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
The advanced AI in Island Expeditions all have different tactics and actions. They are difficult to predict and were actually too difficult when first implemented and had to be adjusted.<br />
Each AI team has a theme appropriate to what kind of team they are. For instance, Worgens are a lot more aggressive while Tauren will prefer to not engage you and try to outplay you.<br />
There are no plans for leaderboards or competitive eSports Island Expeditions as of now.<br />
Instead of getting new abilities or talents while leveling, the bonuses from getting new gear for Azerite slots will fill this void.<br />
Paragon reputation caches are going to continue, but mount rewards with low drop rates are being pulled back.<br />
New pet battle world quests will feature in BfA. There will be new quirky things like rescuing pets, chicken hair styles and new abilities. There is also a new type of pet charms with different rewards. As the expansion progresses more pet battle dungeons will be added.<br />
The Uuna questline introduced new technology that allows character actions to change the appearance of your battle pets such as adding a backpack.<br />
<br />

<br />
Tradechat's Battle for Azeroth Dev Interview<br />
Tradechat's Panser (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=732xizkqfZk&amp;t=3s) sat down with the WoW developers for a quick interview. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions are tuned for three players. There are not solo versions. The AI on easier modes will take longer to show up on the island.<br />
There are no plans for another Mage Tower challenge in Battle for Azeroth, but the team realizes that many different types of people play WoW and are working on new ideas for solo play and content like the Brawler's Guild.<br />
Solo players should have very short ques for Island Expeditions.<br />
There are no plans as of now to have Mythic + modifiers in raids.<br />
The aim of Communities is to bring back connections between players outside of your guild or server.<br />
You will still be able to fly in Eastern Kingdom and Kalimdor BfA content.<br />
The transmog system is still in its infancy and the team is always looking for feedback on what to improve.<br />
There are no plans to loosen transmog restrictions as of now.<br />
The cleansing of the Sunwell is what caused golden eyes options for the Blood Elves.<br />
When the focus on Allied Races dies down a bit the team will take a look at adding more customization for current races.<br />
The decision to remove First Aid happened because as the game evolved, bandaging became less and less common because of self heals and damage reduction cooldowns.<br />
Increased collection achievements for mounts and pets will be added in BfA.<br />
Ferrets are a new pet in BfA.<br />
The latest Alpha build added the new weather 2.0 system. Changes include weather coming from a distance, affecting the camera, etc.<br />
<br />

Wowhead's Battle for Azeroth Dev Interview<br />
Wowhead (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyDQF0SisAA) sat down with the WoW developers for a quick interview. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
Allied races are tied to story lines that feed into Battle for Azeroth and Death Knights are very much tied to the Lich King story.<br />
Island Expeditions will be unlocked via the War campaign and will unlock account wide. This means your alts can do them as they level.<br />
Upright Undead is up to Sylvanas!<br />
Is Wrathion really the last black dragon or could we find more during our Island Expeditions?<br />
The team doesn't have more information on the visual elements of the Heart of Azeroth neck piece.<br />
Hakkar is unrelated to G'huun.<br />
The team wants to do more to improve the visibility of dungeon quests.<br />
Siege of Boralus involves the Horde attacking the city and the Alliance defending it.<br />
<br />
<br />

GASP!<br />
<br />
I can... I can level as a healer... without healing dungeons... I could weep for joy! My Druid is so very resto concept, but I just don't like where dungeon healing has gone! I can dust her off and level her in concept through islands!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, like Arms Warriors have any self heals....oh wait...Victory Rush but that's it. Bandages are quicker than eating non-stat food between fights.</div></div><hr />

So if you are playing death knight, you can't play any new races, today and ever? Why did u hating so much death knights? i really don't care anymore this allied races. if allied races more important thing in bfa for devteam, then bfa is huge disappointment for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at least you have an ability that can heal, mages have never had any self heal spells, and after legion goes, will go back to having nothing to self heal with<br />
but that's ok cos worst dps class in game is a glass cannon amirite? fucking ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Looking for feedback...<br />
<br />
There are no plans to loosen transmog restrictions as of now.<br />
But still not listening to it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can transmog any 2h weapon onto any other 2h weapon, so why not similar restrictions lifted with 1h weapons?<br />
<br />
with regard to Paragon Caches they'll still be there but mounts wont be in them anymore. I mean how hard is it to grasp that? seems clear to me.<br />
<br />

Oh. and Wrathion isn't the last Black Dragon. Its implied that Ebonhorn and Wrathion meet sometime because Ebonhorn says he has &quot;Family Matters to attend to&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When 2 out of 100 000 people use bandages, the development on first aid is better used somewhere else. If people really like bandages so much, they can just buy them from a tailor.<br />
Hopefully this will lead to a new secondary profession in the future.<br />

<br />

You could also stop overpulling so you don't get overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
<br />
shields don't do shit, one major hit from any melee ability depletes them entirely except for maybe ice barrier as frost with enough spellpower to give it a big boost and even then it will only last a couple of hits.<br />
<br />
<br />
'super good cc' ha don't make me laugh, polymorph which is single target only, lasts 1 minute on non player targets and heals the target to full health again, and frost nova, the only root ability available to all mage specs, yeah so good.<br />
<br />
yeah cos food/water from a vendor costs anything anymore, you can stockpile more vendor bought stuff than a mage can hold from 'free casts'<br />
<br />
and finally, let me illuminate you, every expansion since wrath i have done my own form of 'hardmode levelling' where i only use the gear i start the expansion with to get to the new cap then start the gearing up process again, so i don't use quest rewards until i hit the new cap point, i went into cataclysm in the highest quality gear a mage could get, and it was a breeze getting to 85 had no issues, in MoP i started with the highest quality gear a mage could equip with the legendary staff also, and by the time i go to lvl 88 i could hardly kill one trash mob at a time before having to stop to eat to regen health, i never played WoD start, i went into legion as the 203rd best geared mage in the world and i couldn't kill a single pack of trash after hitting 103, and yet the gear rewards i was being offered were worse quality than the gear i was already wearing from a whole expansion ago, so you tell me how you're supposed to level up when that's your reality?</div></div><hr />

A more joyous, optimistic and happy bunch of people could be only be found at a family funeral for a beloved pet that died. <br />

Incorporating world PVP in a game that has never had balanced pvp is akin to arming ISIS with Nukes, while they go around the world griefing everyone. Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with that... Players did not use Bandages because they sucked, so instead of fixing Bandages, they removed First Aid.<br />
<br />
They proved they could improve Bandages with the consumable we can get from Paragon Cache on Argus, they simply had to implement it in the profession and boom, everyone would be using it for outdoor content. They could've made a less-powerful version that we could've used in dungeons as well, maybe replacing the Rune.<br />

<br />
<br />
'super good cc' ha don't make me laugh, polymorph which is single target only, lasts 1 minute on non player targets and heals the target to full health again, and frost nova, the only root ability available to all mage specs, yeah so good.<br />
<br />
yeah cos food/water from a vendor costs anything anymore, you can stockpile more vendor bought stuff than a mage can hold from 'free casts'<br />
<br />
and finally, let me illuminate you, every expansion since wrath i have done my own form of 'hardmode levelling' where i only use the gear i start the expansion with to get to the new cap then start the gearing up process again, so i don't use quest rewards until i hit the new cap point, i went into cataclysm in the highest quality gear a mage could get, and it was a breeze getting to 85 had no issues, in MoP i started with the highest quality gear a mage could equip with the legendary staff also, and by the time i go to lvl 88 i could hardly kill one trash mob at a time before having to stop to eat to regen health, i never played WoD start, i went into legion as the 203rd best geared mage in the world and i couldn't kill a single pack of trash after hitting 103, and yet the gear rewards i was being offered were worse quality than the gear i was already wearing from a whole expansion ago, so you tell me how you're supposed to level up when that's your reality?<br />
<br />
Sounds like a problem you have since all the people I know find Mage to be easy to level with (to the point of boring).<br />
Maybe look at how you could improve as a player with the character you're playing.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to have to disagree with you. I have leveled over 50 characters, and mage is the suckiest. My main is a mage, I know how to play it. This is commonly what I see others say in forums, too. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
But still not listening to it...<br />
<br />
This 100%, they always claim to be listening for feedback but what they really mean is that they're waiting to say something until someone gives feedback about something they were already going to change or adjust. <br />
<br />
They need to explain why it's such an issue for my warglaives to instead look like daggers, or fist weapons. And if we aren't going to be allowed to xmog between armor types then they really need to get to work making a better variety. As a leather wearer I have all of about 3 choices for something thats not full leggings or a full length dress. Yet Paladins, you know.... the people wearing plate armor can have bikinis... How about a mid to 2/3 length skirt? How about shorts that don't look like someone tried wrapping a 5 year olds ms paint picture around my character?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gimme a break... BFA no new talents or abilities confirmed...but well get 2% more damage to stormstrike!!! What a joke.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the old talent trees to me. ;) Or just, you know, Artifact Weapons 2.0.</div></div><hr />

sadly it's the ones that have never experienced it that are the ones that assume it's a player issue and not a class issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that means what exactly?<br />
<br />
No more low drop rate mounts on it as it added another layer of neverending chores (that should have an end like all reputations).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm hoping that's basically what it is, that no more will be added in the future, but the ones already there won't be going away, mostly cause I'm having a hard time getting some to drop.</div></div><hr />
