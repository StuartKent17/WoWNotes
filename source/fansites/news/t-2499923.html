It's always been like that. The only difference is that now you hunt for the same item (just with higher item level) instead of new items (with also higher item level). You're still running after the carrot on a stick either way.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Not really seeing this as a problem, either.<br />

The more concerning thing is that Donald has a point.</div></div><hr />

Yep, but before at least players ran different content. Now its same content during whole expansion that scales instead of giving players new content.</div></div><hr />

As far as dungeons go, that's not a change. The difference is that now the drops are actually useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to know since when this &quot;bug&quot; was active, because i dont remember seeing a single mount drop in malygos 25 since they decides to unify the loot tablets for 10 and 25 man</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely no reason to do it unless you're Mythic raiding or pushing for 99 parse.</div></div><hr />

I’ve slowly slipped into the “I’ll just wait for catchup mechanics” if I bother at all.<br />
<br />
Why grind for gear? It’ll be replaced by the same items at higher ilvl next patch. Why grind AP? The reduction will keep you relevant and when the next big catchup comes out it basically bumps you where everyone else is in a few minutes of play anyway. <br />
<br />
The only stuff that really lasts are mounts, achievements, etc.</div></div><hr />

Drops are useful, but running same dungeon over and over and over again throughout entire expansion gets tiring really fast. That effect is amplified by weekly chests, so players run at least one dungeon a week, often more if they are playing alts. Got another alt to gear up? Run same dungeons again and again and again on multiple modes and then again for whateverforged/socket versions of same items.<br />
<br />
System sucks. It is cost saving system, so developers don't need to make new content - item level reset with each patch, multiple difficulties, whateverforge. It makes platyers run same dungeons again and again and again, while requiring 0 development effort.<br />
<br />
You mean like two entire new zones?<br />
Yes, but still better than running same old dungeons all the time.</div></div><hr />

The only stuff that really lasts are mounts, achievements, etc.Yep, already slipped myself down there since I quit Mythic raiding. Hate how I have to farm outside of raid to get BiS gears. My opinion is that BiS gears should be limited to raid loots only. It make perfectly sense that if you want to have best gears for PvE, you gotta raid. If you want best gear for PvP, you gotta PvP. Dungeon are meant to be catch up or filling in the weak spots. <br />
<br />
Having to farm Vault of the Warden for thousand times to get best trinket (and hope to god they WF/TF and socket) for my Ret Pally is what killed me in first place. It's not fun at all. I absolutely detest it.<br />
<br />
Now I'm just chilling and working on collection stuffs. Gearing up where I can to make farm quicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that it would open new content. Not the exact same content with the difficulty slider notched up.<br />
<br />
And that actually makes all the difference in the world.</div></div><hr />

Exactly that...and the crazy(and lazy) inflation of anything collectible. Too much obvious time sink for too little content.<br />

Been there, done that. Next thing you will notice is that you do not really use much of the collectible stuff. Then you notice that you are basicly grinding useless stuff of which they throw more and more at you(often behind ever increasing time sinks)...and that you pay a subscrition for that &quot;work&quot;. Then you quit. My limit was reached before the last expansion.</div></div><hr />
