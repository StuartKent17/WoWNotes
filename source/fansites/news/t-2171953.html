Warlock and Paladin Class Mount Quest Requirements<br />
I posted this in the main thread, but cross-posting it here for visibility - we'll be re-examining the rare material requirement for the Paladin and Warlock class mounts, we don't want the gate for these to be an expensive tradeskill material.

FEEDBACK: Class Mount Questlines + Flying<br />
Reposting this from my other thread in here, so hopefully the blues can see it: <br />
<br />
So, as an avid lore junkie, I couldn't help myself, and decided to do as many of the mount campaigns as I could on the PTR. I've been loving them so far. But then I stumbled on the Death Knight one. It's very engaging, from a fantasy stand point it's my favorite, but there are a few gleaming lore inconsistencies that go against the main plotline of Cataclym.<br />
<br />
-The Ruby Sanctum is perfectly fine: This is the big thing, that the red dragonflight, and probably by extension all the others, have their sanctums. In the book Twilight of the Aspects, Korialstrasz sacrifices himself to destroy all of the sanctums, because the Twilight's Hammer was using their eggs to create more twilight dragons. I could maybe understand if it were another sanctum, but the Ruby Sanctum was specifically the one that Korialstrasz saw, which prompted his decision to blow it up. <br />
<br />
-Vyrastrasza has whelps: If we get past the fact that we're in a Sanctum that shouldn't exist, there's another glaring problem. The large wyrm in the middle, Vyrastrasza, has whelps. If we go by the provided timelines by Blizzard in Legion and other expansions, dragons are in their whelp stage for around two years. However, the end of the Cataclysm heralded the Age of Mortals, causing the dragonflights to lose not only their titanic powers, but also their ability to reproduce. This was highlighted in the Dawn of the Aspects novel, where Alexstrasza is in a deep depression as the last of her eggs hatch. Now, suddenly, there's a newly created brood mother making eggs! Problem solved? Only it goes against all established lore.<br />
<br />
Hope I don't sound like too much of a nut here, but these problems seriously trouble me, I am really hoping that there is someone who is actively checking storylines for continuity. Thanks for reading!<br />
Thanks for your interest in the Death Knight story! The new Lich King certainly has some... unique requests.<br />
<br />
To answer your lore questions, the whelps you see here, as Senegos mentioned, are likely the last whelps we will see, unless the dragons figure out a way to make more eggs. Some dragons are still in whelp form, though, as they have not matured yet.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum itself was destroyed by Krasus, but some of the dragonflights have chosen to rebuild their sanctums. As you see in the Death Knight quest, the Ruby Sanctum has been completely regrown, and has no traces of any lingering twilight influence.

Marksman Hunter Tier 19 Set Bonus<br />
I'd like to highlight to the Dev team that currently, on live, the Marksman hunter T19 4pc tier bonus has the effect of decreasing the damage done by Piercing Shot by 15%. <br />
This is a bug. Piercing Shot should be affected similarly to other spells, where the cost is changed by the bonus but the damage isn't.

MW Monks and Mythic Raiding<br />
Much like the Disc post in the other thread, Mistweaver is more in a state of thinking ahead for possible refinements, but no immediate shake-ups. This is preliminary, but a possible direction is that some things could be smoothed out by reducing the emphasis on Essence Font. That could help with, for example, drawing out more of a regular ongoing decision between Enveloping Mist, Vivify, and Effuse, rather than having that so often pushed out by Essence Font. Also, making the value of mastery more stable, and reducing the importance of churning as much mana into Essence Fonts as possible. For fair warning, a cooldown on EF is not out of the question after seeing how it's played out, but that would come alongside seeing how other heals might have to be strengthened.<br />
<br />
Rising Thunder has wound up underperforming which we would likely look at at the same time. It would likely be helped regardless by changes that made it easier to spend mana and GCDs on Rising Sun Kick, without always taking away from something like an Essence Font.

Assassination T20 Set Bonus Feedback<br />
The 2-piece will get some single-target benefit. That said, part of the benefit of the bonus is the improved multi-target capability that Garrote has with a shorter cooldown.

Shaman Class Mount Feedback<br />
Thanks for the feedback! In the next PTR build, elemental will be fiery, and enhancement will be stormy.<br />
<br />
We are also making changes to the resto version to make it more watery, and remove the strobe effects.<br />
<br />
Is anything going to be done to reduce the movement of the mount? Looks like I won't be able to use it due to the same sea sickness effect the sky golem causes.<br />
Will investigate, thanks for mentioning it! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/799788-shaman-mounts-problem/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753148816?page=1#12))<br />

Build of the Month - February 2017<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/february/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Rx 470 and 480 sales have been ridiculous lately in the states, and the 480 has caught up to the 1060 after recent driver updates. There is no reason to go nvidia before 1070 level performance unless you are invested in a g-sync monitor.<br />

Totally agree. I never understood why they post as Unicorn Peripherals for speakers Logitech Z523 every single month. Those speakers are so tiny, under-powered and wimpy. Get a true 7.1 surround sound system with an optical in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
having a warlock as a main myself, i dont see the problem here<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaos Bolt's damage has been increased by 25% in PvP situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
that to me more then compensates the other &quot;nerfs&quot; that destro get if you ask me, 25% increase in damage on chaos bolt is a HUGE thing considering how already powerful that spell is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This buff is done to even out the difference between someone who have the bracers and someone who do not. Without bracers you will most likely run Ebon Fever after the change, and that makes disease a much bigger deal. Its a big buff single target and even bigger for AOE.<br />
<br />
Im simming around 12% increase going from Bursting Sores without bracers pre buff, to Ebon Fever after the buff.<br />
<br />
Its around a 10% increase going from Ebon Fever without bracers pre buff, to Ebon Fever after the buff.<br />
<br />
Around 5% buff going from Bursting Sores without bracers pre buff, to Bursting Sores after the buff.<br />
<br />
With bracers the buff is going to be smaller relativly speaking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oftenwrongsoong</div><div class="date">2017-02-20, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand your monthly computer build recommendations. I suspect &quot;Unicorn&quot; is the &quot;best&quot; build recommendation of the options, right? That notwithstanding, none of them make any sense at all.<br />
<br />
For example, your power supply for the &quot;unicorn&quot; is a paltry $99 EVGA G2 with 650W? Um, for a &quot;unicorn&quot; build you'd probably need at least 1000W and you should use at least a Corsair HXi or better.<br />
<br />
Motherboard is the ASUS Z270-A? WTF? If you have a Unicorn build you want to OC and tweak, and definitely want the most options and stability available to you, so you should at least have the ASUS Hero IX or IX Code motherboard.<br />
<br />
The &quot;unicorn&quot; is fitted with 16GB of DDR 4 memory... Um, really?<br />
<br />
Graphics card, the &quot;unicorn&quot; of computers this month is the 1060 or 1070... what in the actual fuck are you recommending?<br />
<br />
And don't even get me going on your peripheral recommendations. A 60Hz monitor is your &quot;unicorn?&quot; And why the hell are you recommending the Z523s?<br />
<br />
The recommendations are laughable, and I hope no one ever actually takes them seriously. It's clear you are simply passing along cheap substitutes to your audience in the hopes they click the link and buy it. Don't mask these recommendations as anything other than what they are: Cheap builds that you think your audience can afford in the hopes they click your link.<br />

Um, for a &quot;unicorn&quot; build you'd probably need at least 1000W and you should use at least a Corsair HXi or better.<br />
<br />
Motherboard is the ASUS Z270-A? WTF? If you have a Unicorn build you want to OC and tweak, and definitely want the most options and stability available to you, so you should at least have the ASUS Hero IX or IX Code motherboard.<br />
<br />
The &quot;unicorn&quot; is fitted with 16GB of DDR 4 memory... Um, really?<br />
<br />
Graphics card, the &quot;unicorn&quot; of computers this month is the 1060 or 1070... what in the actual fuck are you recommending?<br />
<br />
And don't even get me going on your peripheral recommendations. A 60Hz monitor is your &quot;unicorn?&quot; And why the hell are you recommending the Z523s?<br />
<br />
1000W is extreme overkill, you can do overclocked 1070 SLI with 650W. <br />
<br />
Most people using a guide aren't going to be overclocking to the very extreme limits and won't gain anything from buying a higher end mobo. <br />
<br />
You can always buy another set of 16GB if you need it, but 16 is still sufficient for most people. <br />
<br />
Unicorn doesn't mean a $3000 computer, it is just the highest specs of the listed builds.<br />
<br />
Happy to look at other speaker suggestions at that price point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right? 5% is a &quot;tweak&quot; - 25% is a huge change. The percentages that they're tweaking with are sadly funny - Holinka just keeps screwing that pooch over and over. Templates were a good idea on paper, but like everything he touches, it just doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

I suspect &quot;Unicorn&quot; is the &quot;best&quot; build recommendation of the options, right? That notwithstanding, none of them make any sense at all.<br />

<br />
The recommendations are laughable, and I hope no one ever actually takes them seriously. It's clear you are simply passing along cheap substitutes to your audience in the hopes they click the link and buy it. Don't mask these recommendations as anything other than what they are: Cheap builds that you think your audience can afford in the hopes they click your link.<br />
<br />
Disgusting. Get it off the front page.<br />
<br />
A lot of thought has never been put into them. It has always jumped out to me as a lazy thrown together build. The important part being that they are all amazon links so MMO-Champion makes some money whenenver someone buys something using those links. I also agree even suggesting to put a 1060 in a ~1400 build is ridiculous and a 1070 should be the standard for that price point, but you can easily even fit a 1080 into a $1400 budget.<br />
<br />
That being said, you are totally off with the PSU requirement and 16GB is more than 99.9% of gamers will use in the near future.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Chaos Bolt's damage has been increased by 25% in PvP situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
that to me more then compensates the other &quot;nerfs&quot; that destro get if you ask me, 25% increase in damage on chaos bolt is a HUGE thing considering how already powerful that spell is.<br />
<br />
A 25% damage buff is all well and good, but making it a slower cast time indirectly through nerfing backdraft and reverse entropy? God forbid a melee misses his interrupt :P How many iterations of chaos bolt damage have we gone through so far this patch already? They have no clue what they're doing.</div></div><hr />

Corsair makes some decent cases around $50, Rosewill Challenger is also okay.</div></div><hr />

what? the dmg buff in no way compensates for the cast time nerf.<br />
what does it matter that the dmg was bumped if it's now a lot harder to get casts off?</div></div><hr />
