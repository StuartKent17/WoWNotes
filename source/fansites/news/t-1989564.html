Warcraft Movie Rewards<br />
Mamytwink (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/warcraft-obtenez-le-jeu-et-4-transmogrifications-du-film-avec-kinepolis) noticed that Kinepolis (https://kinepolis.fr/conditions-warcraft) has rewards for seeing the Warcraft movie listed on their site. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this doesn't mean every country and cinema will have these rewards and that no official announcement has been made.<br />

Luckily transmog is battle-net account wide so it won't really be a problem to get them even if you do have to create a NEW account.<br />
<br />

I'm hoping this will apply to Odeon UK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check out your local warcraft movie website (german would be http://www.warcraft-film.de/ for example).<br />
It has a ticket section that will recommend several cinemas. My guess is that these will participate in the promotion.</div></div><hr />

It's horrible! How dare they give stuff for free to improve their subnumbers (which we will not see)?! It really destroys any fun I have playing the game... Oh wait, no, it doesn't matter one bit. Whiner.<br />
<br />
OT: I hope Vue Cinemas or Path√© will have this promo too.</div></div><hr />

The movie releases earlier in the EU, May 25 in France.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This literally has no affect on press release since they aren't releasing numbers. And it has absolutely no affect on greed since... you know, free.<br />
<br />
WoD is still more than making bank. If we assume another 600k subs lost in the last quarter they still sit at 5 million. Which is WELL over any other MMO in the world for a subscription based game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect. If they are FACTION specific, transmog rules still apply too them. You will not be able to use them on the opposite faction.</div></div><hr />

The movie comes out at different dates depending where you live. EU is going to be earlier this time, btw ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, there was a promo that went out that I never got around to posting. I guess I'll mention it next time for those that somehow got it and missed the email.</div></div><hr />

You can't even choose the Scandinavian countries on that site.<br />
<br />
It'll take some time for all the different cinemas in all the different countries to update their sites with this information, so I'll hold my breath for now.</div></div><hr />

That's not incorrect until proven that they ARE faction specific. THEN it would be incorrect. You're more than likely right, but still. It'd be weird if they made it so basically only some of the classes get a mog. Hunters, (non-Outlaw) Rogues, and (enhancement) Shamans can't use ANY of them as it stands already, so making it even more select would be weird.</div></div><hr />

You are freaking HIGH on something if you think WoW is at 5mil right now. They were at 5mil their last earnings call 6 months ago.<br />

If so i wont even bother getting any Artifact Weapon. You can't &quot;not bother getting Artifact&quot; unless you won't bother buying and playing Legion either. There are no end game weapons in Legion. Only artifact relics that upgrade artifact weapons. They are central to classes playstyle, adding complementary rotational abilities and so on. <br />
<br />
Also they can be transmogged into anything a normal weapon of its type could. So for example warrior can mog artifact sword to mace or axe, but ele shaman can only mog his to fist and fire mage can only mog his to sword. <br />
<br />
Other weapons cannot be transmogged TO artifact. So after legion say bye bye to cool artifact looks, unless next expac changes the rules.</div></div><hr />

Does Blizz ever do promotions that are that small?<br />
<br />
It's their big cinematic debut. They're not going to restrict these movie mogs to a tiny handful of people who are able to see the movie before everyone else.<br />
<br />
The gametime and whatnot might be a separate, smaller promotion.<br />

I'm sorry what?<br />
<br />
Speaking as a &quot;Vets&quot; myself, I don't see why we should get any additional rewards compared to any other movie goer?<br />
<br />
So we've paid money to the company that made the film for 10 years, whats your point?<br />
<br />
They've made the film and given people a bonus for buying tickets. You could call it a welcome package for new players since its free game time and shiny x mog items from the word go. <br />
<br />
However, everyone else is allowed to claim that. Its not like Sky or BT who say &quot;New members get the all inclusive package for 50% of normal rate&quot;. We're getting exactly the same as everyone else. They could of easily made it so the codes couldn't be applied to accounts made before the ticket sales opened up</div></div><hr />

lol ... last time announced was MONTHS ago, several. And from the looks of logs when they made that announcement there were at least 5 times (closer to 8 times as many but I'm not going to do the math, it's a lot, obviously) as many people raiding as there are this week. You are definitely high on a lot if you think anything close to even 5 million people are playing, or even more than half of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you think that in 6 months WoW has lost 4.5 million subs at least? You say closer to 8 times less. So you think the game has 600-700k subs left?</div></div><hr />

They should at the very least offer more than 4 skins, maybe a free month, or an exclusive mount. Something to make up for what we already have - The game and five/six expansions.

I'd put money on it having a huge dip, there is nothing to do in WoD, hardly justifies the 50 cents a day to play honestly.<br />

There are a few high pop realms, most are low pop and that was before raising capacity. Another thing is tokens are over 40k, and something like 80k in eu, pretty sad.</div></div><hr />

In American realms the time they announced 5.5 subs the token cost 37k on Average. Now it costs 43k average? OMG The end of the world!<br />
<br />
Europe one is a bigger increase from 63k to 84k. Could mean fewer people paying real money for them? Vs more people wanting to buy them for gold?<br />

There is still no way in hell or this earth that wow lost 4.5 million subs.</div></div><hr />

For the longest time they were 25k, then went to 30k+, and now 40k+ Not the end of the world, just saying not many people buying nor selling, probably because not many people playing. I play on a high pop realm, and its sparse at times.</div></div><hr />

Ok, but the fact that in the last 6 months there's been a 6k increase in the price? I doubt the subs dropped more than 800k.</div></div><hr />

Already said that. It went from 63k to 84k since the last earnings call in November. <br />

It was august. and those numbers were for the end of june. So 10 months, which is just under a year, and closer to the year ago mark then the 6 month ago mark so no you are not correct.</div></div><hr />

Do you? What I quoted suggests that you believe there's a connection between total people on the market and increase in price. Do you expect me to read everything you've said? <br />

The last earnings call for WoW numbers was Announced November 3rd. That was for the 3rd quarter of 2015. The last report was NOT back in August? 3rd quarter ONLY lost 100k subs. <br />

The current community is going to eat these new people alive in group content, and probably everywhere else too. &quot;Fucking noob, retarded, asshole, gogogogo! Nice shield /kick!

I fear there are so many changes that what lore hooked you in the first place you won't actually see on screen and you'll have to many WTF moments. To much changed just to make a movie is usually where these games to movies go wrong.</div></div><hr />

At least 10 people that I know have at least a year of subscription time already because gold is so readily available. I mean I have 6 alts all with a lvl 3 salvage hut, I log in twice a day for 10 minutes and with the salvage chests and gold missions from the garrison and shipyard I make at a minimum 4000g per character per week. That does not include any of the items like pvp, oil or garrison resource items that sell for 800-3000g a piece that I usually get on average once per week on one character. Do the math, at a minimum I make 24K per week total with 20 minutes of time each day.<br />

edit: I started WoD with 155K in gold, and I have spent at least 2 million gold gearing/buying mounts and junk like that and I still have 1.5 million gold in the bank.</div></div><hr />

laughing my ass off, desperate for a month sub before launch hits? Wod is dead in the water<br />
<br />
Think you mean Legion there. WoD is already dead and has been since at least September of 2015. Seems a little stupid though to force the use of the game time before there is anything to do in game though, but makes sense because it's only an account up to WoD, not legion included.</div></div><hr />

What is the point anyways? You can't Transmog your artifact weapons anything but the Artifact Transmogs<br />
Yes u can? U can transmog the artifact weapons into any other weapon using the same animations... you can't transmog other weapons to look like the artifacts though.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Because people seeing it are totally going to because they might get expansions for a game they either already have, or are expansions to a game they don't already play.<br />

I went to see The Revenant. I didn't need to be bribed by a bunch of bullshit to go. I went cause it looked good. I enjoyed it. No free game though. They're just desperate.</div></div><hr />

lmao. ok kiddo.<br />

Like I said considering most people that will see it either have the games, or won't even know there is a promotion for the games means it's kind of laughable that you think it's &quot;desperation&quot;</div></div><hr />

How does that even relate? One is simply a movie, while another ranges from books to games to comics to action figures to toys, etc...</div></div><hr />

Well there are movies that are released that don't give you a bunch of free shit to go see them. Then there are movies that suck and try to bribe you into see it by giving you entire games and free months and transmog items etc etc.</div></div><hr />

You obviously can't comprehend the concept if you still can't get the point I'm making.<br />
<br />
People playing the game already own the games = no bribe.<br />
People that don't play the game or go to the forums would only find out they got the code when they were already at the Cinema to see said movie = no bribe.<br />
<br />
About the only people that would benefit would be people who see warcraft that used to play but don't anymore, and most of those people quit for a reason or would be too salty to use it anyway. so no benefit or bribe.<br />
<br />
If you think it's a bribe that is pretty sad for you.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and sometimes I go see movies that don't even have a plot. I don't need no stinking bribes, like a plot, or acting, or a decent storyline, or proper effects, or people I've ever heard of, or pretty ladies taking off their clothes!<br />

You are saying Blizzard aren't bribing anyone because no one will use it. So they are effectively wasting their time. <br />

They aren't bribing people though. That is the point. It is a bonus for People that may see the movie and want to try the game afterwards. If you can't understand simple things like that...well that is just sad for you.</div></div><hr />

You say closer to 8 times less. So you think the game has 600-700k subs left?<br />
<br />
based on the amount of people logging in, with the amount of people that I know that are still subbed but do not log in adding to active population, compared to how many 6 months ago when numbers were last announced I'd estimate that between 2.5 and 3 million are subbed, and about 1.5 to 2 million are active (even if only to log in very casually and mostly just collect garrison gold). 8 times less people raiding doesn't mean subs, that's just people raiding.</div></div><hr />
