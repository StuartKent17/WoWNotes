Get the exclusive Landro's Pet Box Loot Code! This World of Warcraft in-game loot item will randomly give you one of the following Loot items:<br />
<br />
Papa Hummel's Pet Biscuit (WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Papa_Hummel%27s_Old-Fashioned_Pet_Biscuit))<br />
Path of Cenarius (WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Path_of_Cenarius))<br />

<br />
Most of the time, you'll crack a Papa Hummel's Pet Biscuit, Path of Cenarius, or Sandbox Tiger. Sweet, right? UDE Points for loot codes! But remember, there's a little gamble here. Once in a while, your MMO character will pop the box and find a Ethereal Trader, Dragon Kite, or Bananas the Monkey pet!<br />
<br />
So, do you feel lucky? Have your MMO character equip all those lucky charms and give the box a shot. After all, you never know what's in the box!<br />
<br />
All items are bind on pick-up. You will not recieve a duplicate pet (Etheral Trader, Dragon Kite, Bananas the Monkey) if you already own one.<br />

Blue posts<br />
I guess I was a little wrong and our lovely blue posters are still active for the moment, hurray!<br />
Removing all the RP from CoT: Stratholme<br />
This is something we'd like to do and we may do it in the future, but it's not something to expect just over the horizon. This kind of change would require a fairly large technical overhaul of our existing dungeons. When it comes down to it, we'd rather have the story in the game for those who want to see it and work on making it something that you can bypass at a later date. <br />
<br />
[...] See the portion of my post where I speak of &quot;major changes&quot; to existing dungeons. With Trial of the Champion. we were already aware of the potential issue. We were able to plan for that instance, specifically, to have a dialog option to opt out of the Role-playing portion. Additionally, there are specific character movements that make the issue more complicated in the Culling of Stratholme events.

<br />
Bryntroll damage too high? - Bryntroll, the Bone Arbiter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50415/bryntroll-the-bone-arbiter/) (Heroic (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50709/bryntroll-the-bone-arbiter/))<br />
Because we removed the passive stats to add the procs to some weapons in Icecrown we were a little more generous with what they could do to keep them interesting/fun even if a lot of players felt they would be terrible without the passive stats. The Nibelung staff can proc a lot of Valâ€™kyr so this isn't a Bryntroll/melee specific topic.<br />
<br />
Just to avoid surprises, procs like this are the kind of thing you will likely see a lot more of in order for gear to not to feel so predictable and boring from tier to tier.<br />
<br />
As far as the PvP concerns, the classes that can use this weapon were already quite popular so we are keeping an eye on things and see if any noticeable impact happens on them. <br />
<br />
[...] You are kind of mixing two different things together. Yes, it can be harder to eyeball and item's value with procs like this, but this is only one item slot (sure, two for those titan gripping folk) and pretty unlikely to be something that will be put on a character from head to toe. The &quot;eyeball&quot; of an item's worth also isn't intended to cut down every item to being a system of +1 to your previous item or anything like that, we still want decisions to be made.<br />
<br />
The goal is to make them a little more fun and interesting and while players will figure out which one(s) are best, hopefully the interest in the proc alone will be a bit of a factor in the item. I know personally if I can spawn some random val'kyr, I'll take a small dps loss, heh. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22048466047-byrntroll-proc-does-more-damage-than-ss.html))<br />
<br />
Cross-realms Raids<br />
Doing this is a bit more complicated than the 5 player dungeons. For 5 player dungeons it's not a big deal to allow the random heroics to skip lock outs and is not very hard to setup a group. We obviously can't skip lockouts for raids and it just much more common for raids to not complete all of the content, so you could come back a few days later and find someone else cleared your instance. It's definitely something that sounds good in theory but there are a lot of issues that we would have to figure out first. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22048446032-cross-realm-raids.html))<br />
<br />
Faction changes and quests reset<br />
This is pretty much the case. It's a side effect of the translation tables used to transition a character from one faction to the other. We didn't necessarily intentionally make sure that people would lose the Crusader title. It is just a complication of the system's technology that results in resetting the tournament quests, as with all other faction-specific quests. All in all, there are advantages and disadvantages to this. For instance, a faction change allows additional opportunities to go back and quest in certain zones a second time if one would like a quick source of income beyond grinding daily quests, or if one simply seeks the opportunity to experience zone questing from the other faction's point of view.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, at least you don't have to grind reputation anymore if you want your Crusader title and Argent Crusade vendor privileges back. You just need to go through the quest lines to champion each faction again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22048445500-why-when-i-faction-change-does.html))<br />
<br />
Is raiding too easy?<br />
We see posts like this from time to time but they tend to not include any compelling argument. Nostalgia is powerful. In a game that has been out this long there can be a lot of great memories of the past that you would relish to relive again. We understand this, but, the game continues to move forward and changes are made to benefit the entire playerbase.<br />
<br />
As opposed to the old systems of years ago, the current raiding content is more accessible to more people. Yes, this is a good thing. The way emblems reward items also allow more players to be on the same or similar levels of gear and help minimize/avoid the &quot;I'm in max gear and smash all faces&quot; scenarios that force players to start from the very beginning raid content no matter how progressed the content patches are.<br />
<br />
For players who are only satisfied by beating the highest level content and the most challenging encounters, the hard modes are available. Encounters like Yogg-0 and Anub'arak 25 are no joke. Then, the Lich King awaits (behind his walls). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22049926379-am-i-alone-to-hate-how-easy-this-is.html))<br />
<br />
Damagemeter / Highest DPS<br />
I don't think it's that players are necessarily trying to pad the meters (though I'm sure that does happen). I think the risk is misinterpreting &quot;highest damage ever&quot; as some kind of metric of how *you* do in your raid. The goal here is not to break the world record and win a gold medal. The goal is to defeat the boss, and it's probably a boss you are going to be fighting week after week. Consistency is generally more important than occasionally achieving huge numbers.<br />
<br />
Consider two players below:<br />
<br />
Player A has a damage range of 8000 to 12,000 dps. His average is 10,000 dps and 90% of the time he is near 10,000 dps. When the stars align, he can reach 12,000 dps. He sometimes drops to 8000 dps too.<br />
<br />
Player B has a damage range of 10,000 to 11,500 dps. His average is 10,750 dps, but he still hits 11,500 quite often.<br />
<br />
Now who would you rather have with you? Probably B. Yet when you look at a &quot;Highest damage ever&quot; list, you'll see A pegged at 12K and B pegged at 11.5K and worry that &quot;A wins.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22048446347-the-problem-with-wowmeterhighest-dps-lists.html))<br />

2H Frost Raiding Build<br />
It's not very likely you'll see a viable two-hand Frost raiding build any time soon. Each death knight tree already offers a good deal of versatility given that there are potential DPS, tanking and PvP avenues in each. They're designed so that players can choose their path based on play style and flavor, not because of role (in the way that a Holy priest who wants to DPS as Holy is out of luck). Trying to also have dual-wield versions from Blood and Unholy builds made the matrix of what we wanted to accomplish a little too large. If there does end up being a viable two-hand Frost build that works, we're not going to go out of our way to break it. That said, we aren't going to go out of our way to promote it either. The Frost tree is currently meant to be a dual-wield tree much in the same way the Fury tree is a dual-wield tree for warriors.

Boosting Spirit Beasts / Nerfing Wolves<br />
The spirit beasts are not the real issue from our perspective. We this spirit beasts are doing fine and we don't want them to be the only choice for BM hunters since speccing BM should give a player more choices for pets (ideally) and not less.<br />
<br />
The problem mainly lies with the wolf just being overpowered. We did consider nerfing them for patch 3.3 but decided that the nerf to pretty much all hunter PvE dps was not worth the benefit of providing more options for pets. Keep in mind though that we have and will continue to make unpopular or even controversial nerfs if we feel they are a benefit for the game.

Beast Mastery<br />
It may not be great for raiding but is still good for leveling while both Marks and Surv are competitive for raiding. I wouldn't expect any big changes for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22050165921-any-plans-to-buff-spirit-beasts.html))<br />

They do little compared to like BM of course and yes they give you some AP but how is that close to being so strong as like lock pets/DK pets etc. Idk thats just my Opinion really. Blizzard gives us jack for pets to use that are &quot;equal&quot; and it rather sucks not being able to be a &quot;hunter &amp; pet&quot; and have a choice. I go BM sometimes just to feel diffrent and neat having a spirit beast or dinosaur. Only reason so many hunters are BM at 80 is cause it has the idea of having options and looking neat imo...</div></div><hr />

Believe me, I've read more than enough about the uptime and damage of the val'kyr and it's not too impressive and definitely not in the same league with Bryntroll. I mean sure the concept is cool but with the 1% proc rate it's also kind of depressing to think of it not proccing at all during a boss fight.</div></div><hr />

We see posts like this from time to time but they tend to not include any compelling argument. Nostalgia is powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
No compelling argument? Every half competent guild cleared the new raid bosses in half a raid night; that's just wasted content. Yes, it's the easymode that was released, but that's the latest end-game content out there. And it's way too easy. Further, it's pathetic to think that nobody else is capable of understanding how nostalgia works.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm nostalgic to some old fights, but it doesn't change the fact that WotLK raiding content is far easier than TBC, for example. This is in large part due to the 10/25 difficulties, bosses must be designed in a way that scales easily between different numbers of players. Doing a boss like the original Kael'thas just isn't possible in the current system since it doesn't scale down well for a 10 man raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
For players who are only satisfied by beating the highest level content and the most challenging encounters, the hard modes are available. Encounters like Yogg-0 and Anub'arak 25 are no joke. Then, the Lich King awaits (behind his walls).<br />
<br />
<br />
Except there are no new hard modes. They didn't release ICC hard modes, and won't be releasing them for months. It's not exactly a compelling argument when the only end-game raiding content is the mind-numbingly easy normal modes. And they didn't even address the fact that it's still the same boss in the same room with the same lore, you just do it twice. That's not real end-game progress raiding, something that has not existed in the whole of WotLK.</div></div><hr />

It's a well known fact that melee get bigger boost to dps from their weapon than casters do, so those people who have in the first 2 resets managed to get Bryntroll will notice a big jump in their dps, and then slower improvements as they upgrade their armour. <br />
<br />
Caster who get the new weapon won't see the same large jump, but will, over time scale 'better' with each additional piece of armour they get.<br />
<br />
So, in short, the sample group is too small so far to determine outright if the weapon is OP. It just seems that those who were lucky to get it are becoming OP with it.</div></div><hr />

WotLK is the easiest expansion so far in terms of raiding. Apart from 1 or 2 hardmodes, the whole game has been faceroll cakemode.<br />
<br />
Yes prenerfed Yogg + 0, HC Anub and Firefighter were hard. But 3 hard encounters dont make up for 1.5 years worth of raid content to keep everyone busy does it.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 year and a month.<br />
<br />
I'm calling it as I see it, dood. Especially when you gys have spent over a year +1 month complaining about the same ol' things, and possibly when the problems were/will be addressed.<br />
<br />
For those that have spent the last few months raiding the whining comes off as obnoxious and petty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
W/E though, easy expansion is easy.<br />
<br />
I dont actually care though, ive gone casual. WotLK has kinda forced me to go casual because otherwise i would just sit in Ironforge 6 days a week with nothing to do.<br />
<br />
I must admit it kind of suits me. I just feel sorry for good guilds that want to actually play the game. They have nothing to play at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is kind of my point? Thank you?<br />
<br />
Come Cata there will be people who say Wrath was the best raiding experience they've ever had, just like people said Vanilla was the best when TBC was hot. Independance day was a terrible movie, but people only remember that it was considered great, but don't remember much about the movie itself.</div></div><hr />

If they do say that, then it will be because Cataclysm was awful, otherwise im quite certain most people will say be saying Cataclysm is better.<br />
<br />
Nobody will mention any raid in WotLK with high regard except Ulduar. And when Cataclysm is out and people remember that Ulduar was the only good raid, their penny will drop and they will realise that WotLK was in fact a bad expansion overall for end game raiding.<br />

No, because Sunwell prenerf was so hard, that even the elitists were wiping like mad. This means people actually beating the encounter were in so low numbers that they felt special. No that a lot of players get to see the endgame content (apart from hard modes) the can't feel so elitist any more and hence: &quot;WotLK is too easy, buff, casuals ruin the game, QQ!&quot;<br />
<br />
A lot of raiders have yet to see Algalon and may never see him pre Cata, but one encounter solely designed for the hardcore raiders is apparently not enough sto stop the QQ.<br />

Bouboulie was quoting a blue. He didn't *call* anything. And scripted events are how games handle role play. Just like every &quot;role playing&quot; computer game on the market. Of course it's not as good or as natural as human RP, but it's how the game works.</div></div><hr />

I gave up caring about WotLK though tbh. Worst expansion out of them all for end game content. It's terribad.<br />
<br />
Went casual a short while ago and levelling alts now etc. I just play when i want and how i want instead of committing to any kind of decent guild, i can pug everything and have a laugh more.<br />
<br />
I hate how end game raiding has gone, nothing will beat TBC in terms of fun for raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is exactly why Blizzard implemented the new raiding system/difficulties. There are more people that play like this, then those that raid for extremely hard content 6 nights a week. You know, sometimes I wonder how many of the QQers that post on these forums even raided the tough content back in BC or Vanilla. I refuse to believe everyone that was in a top 100 or 200 guild in the world or whatever really good guild, all read, and contribute to these forums (no disrespect to MMO-Champion, best WoW related fansite on the net). I know I was never in an amazing Hardcore guild, but I did raid some of the so-called toughest raids in BC including TK, Hyjal, BT, and I'm currently raiding Wrath raids and I appreciate this content. This last patch is arguably the best content patch in WoW history, prolly second to Sunwell.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is you can never please everyone I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ulduar is one of the best, most versatile and beautiful instances they have ever created. And I think you're a complete idiot to be hailing BC so much. There were 4 that's right FOUR hard encounters in BC.<br />
<br />
I've been raiding hardcore since the very beginning and have cleared everything in this game at the time it was meant to be cleared. And BC was in no way as hard as you make it out to be.<br />
<br />
I shall list the 4 hard encounters for you:<br />
<br />
1. Pre-nerf Gruul<br />
2. Pre-nerf Kael'thas<br />
3. Pre-nerf M'uru<br />
4. Pre-nerf Kil'jaeden<br />
<br />
Nothing else in BC was &quot;hard&quot;. It was all more or less faceroll if you had people that had half a brain in your raid.<br />
<br />
So far in WotLK the list looks like this (all of this pre-nerf again so i don't have to repeat it a thousand times):<br />
<br />
1. Freya + 3 (thinking of being in full Naxx gear here the first wave of kills)<br />
2. Firefighter<br />
3. Yogg-0<br />
4. Anub'arak (not quite as hard as the others but still hard enough to make the list)<br />
<br />
Now that's 4 already in WotLK and we haven't even seen the final hardmodes that are supposed to be sunwell style and tear us a new one. Stop comparing BC raiding with the normal modes. It makes no sense.<br />
<br />
Btw you wanna talk about something dull in BC the dreadful BT farm before Sunwell came out. 8 months of pure boredom.<br />
<br />
Hardmodes is where it's at. No hardcore player should ever complain about normal modes since those are not aimed at him. Wait for the hardmodes and then start complaining that they're too easy. If indeed they are too easy.<br />
<br />
I have a sneaky suspicion though that Arthas will in fact rip us a new one on hardmode. And so will the Blood Queen and hopefully others too.</div></div><hr />

Maybe a better question is to ask what determines the difficulty of the encounter?<br />
Is an encounter hard because of the gear requirements?<br />
Is it hard because of the skill and coordination of the players required?<br />
Is an encounter hard becuase of the boss mechanics?<br />

<br />
The interesting thing is that the new feature is actually not the hard modes. The hardmodes are how all raids used to be. Every boss was a hard mode. Very few guilds downed Vashj and Kael Thas before they were nerfed and people outgeared the content, for example. Only a couple guilds per server down heroic anub on 25 man, same with algalon 25 man. The easy modes are in fact the new feature. I don't mind this design at all, allows the hardcore guilds to get he better loot and down the bosses more of BC and vanilla proportions, yes does not exclude people who enjoy raids but don't have time or schedule for the hardcore stuff</div></div><hr />

<br />
You also missed out VashJ, in fact you missed out all of SSC which was all hard prenerfed.<br />
<br />
I bet you never tried Magtheridon when you needed 4 clicker per box, meaning you had 20 clickers in the raid, all on 4 man rotations, the same Magtheridon where the trash packs were harder than WotLK normal modes.<br />
<br />
Lets not forget that all of Sunwell was massively hard prenerfed, yea Felmyst, Twins and Kalegos were all a breeze, NOT.<br />
<br />
You Sir, are what is known as a prime time b-sh**ter.<br />

I told you to stop comparing BC raiding with normal modes. You are what is known as an ignorant tool. Vashj was heavily bugged not &quot;hard&quot;. All of SSC hard? please give me a fucking break. You were obviously raiding with idiots at the time.<br />
<br />
Magtheridon... seriously? The trash was hard because it was trash that could actually kill you as opposed to the aoe fest that is trash in WotLK yes. But it wasn't &quot;hard&quot;. It was in fact easily doable if your members weren't shit.<br />
As to Magtheridon himself... how can you call a simple 4 group rotation hard? That's like saying Gurtogg Bloodboil was hard if you did the 3 group rotation tactic.<br />
<br />
I will give you Karazhan but only Nightbane. The others weren't exactly hard either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weapons these days either have tons of hit or expertise. Players at a gear level capable of doing ICC25 are riding very close to the cap on both these stats; in fact, the key to maximizing your DPS is to be as little over the hit cap and expertise cap as you can manage (though this is more important for some classes than others; unholy DKs can afford to be over the hit cap by more than others, for example.)<br />
<br />
It is extremely beneficial to be able to have a weapon that has neither hit nor expertise on it, but has some other worthwhile DPS boost built into it.<br />
<br />
That is why Bryntoll is OP right now. Citadel Enforcer's Claymore? Gobs of hit that prevents you from using the ilvl 245 badge trinkets. Ramaldni's Blade of Culling or Obsidian Edge Blade? Same deal with expertise. Quel'Delar? Stats are ok, but haste is a pretty worthless stat for a lot of 2h melee classes.<br />
<br />
This is also why Dual Blade Butcher was such a sought-after weapon; it had all of the most desired stats for melee classes on one weapon (str, stam, dps, armor pen) and wasted none of its item budget on stats that did not translate to DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You being in a top 50, only proves my point to be true :) Did you know it took over 16 weeks for Karazhan to be cleared by the 500th guild to clear it? The 200th guild took over 8 weeks.<br />
<br />
Wotlk hard modes have not been as hard as that with the exception of yogg0, firefighter, Anub.<br />
<br />
So yea, might wana do some more research before you say content is easy when you are in a top 50th guild.<br />
<br />
After the Yogg + 0 tactics were released i got Deaths Demise in 1 night. And that is supposedly the hardest fight in WotLK. So yea, TBC content in general was much harder.<br />
<br />
I also do not know a single person that thought MAgtheridon + 4 clickers was easy, everyone said it was rediculously hard. You are basically a tool.<br />
<br />
And you started the name calling, so dont try and lecture me about such things ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Take your knowledge of the game now and take it back to the start of BC assuming released tactics for Karazhan and then claim the same thing again.<br />
<br />
We've evolved as players. We know more now than we ever did before. You have to compare stuff in perspective. If we went back with the current knowledge of game mechanics and possible boss abilities do you honestly think BC bosses would have taken so long to down?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not even going to comment on the irony inherent in &quot;most dumbest&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hunters have 3 dps trees. Same as mages, rogues, and warlocks.<br />
<br />
I haven't been keeping perfect track of those three classes, but last I checked:<br />
<br />
Mages: Fire/Arcane raid viable, Frost not so much.<br />
Warlocks: Destro/Affli raid viable, Demo not so much.<br />
Rogues: Combat/Assassination raid viable, Subtlety not so much.<br />
<br />
So why complain that hunters have 2 viable raid specs instead of 3? BM still produces decent damage, too, just not on par with the others - more than enough for heroics and the like. And BM is still arguably one of the best soloing specs in existence.<br />
<br />
Last time BM was massively raid viable was pre-3.0.8. And personally, I was bored out of my mind playing as BM then. I was happy when BM got nerfed to hell, it let me start playing a spec that actually involved some skill and involvement besides the binary check of &quot;am I standing in fire?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

i think WotlK is more fun than Vanilla and TBC but its my opinion. There is still some place to find hard encounter. But i think there is a bias with Hard encounter and the gear you get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most ppl doesn't mind to do Yogg +0 because they dont need anything from it. They want to stand in the best gear in (put major citie of the xpac here) so other ppl can see their awesomeness. <br />

i dont play wow for that. Yes its fun sometime but in the end, its only a game. Its not the best place to get self esteem imho<br />
<br />
anyway<br />
<br />
for the BM posts, i think BM is fine like is it. Best soloing tree should not be the best raiding tree imho. anyway, when you have a dual spec with a pure DPS class, its not like you dont have the choice...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barreveler</div><div class="date">2009-12-22, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You being in a top 50, only proves my point to be true :) Did you know it took over 16 weeks for Karazhan to be cleared by the 500th guild to clear it? The 200th guild took over 8 weeks.<br />
<br />
Wotlk hard modes have not been as hard as that with the exception of yogg0, firefighter, Anub.<br />
<br />
So yea, might wana do some more research before you say content is easy when you are in a top 50th guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
I seriously want some of what you're smoking, comparing Kara to Yogg+0. <br />
<br />
You're missing one big point and two smaller points here. <br />
<br />
The first point is that required gear farming is just not equal to an instance being hard. A truly difficult boss will remain somewhat difficult even when you're a tier or two higher gearwise. Sure, gear level plays into difficulty, but that's pretty much all Kara really was, was a steep gear curve. <br />
<br />
The plain fact is that the gap in gear from Vanilla raiding gear to Kara gear was vastly larger than the gap from Naxx 25 gear to Ulduar Gear. <br />
<br />
When BC was released, only the people in absolutely full T3 (which was &lt;3% of the playerbase) could go into Kara with any chance of success. And clearing Kara in T3 really required you to be on the ball. <br />
<br />
Everyone else had to spend weeks farming BC Heroic gear, and only the really hardcore players were the ones religiously farming 5 every available heroic every possible day to get that gear. But even once you got &quot;Kara gear,&quot; Kara was relatively easy at least past Curator. Only a handful of fights remained difficult once you were in a set of BC Epics, Prince, Nightbane, maybe Terestrian. This isn't even clearing Kara in SSC gear, (which is akin to clearing 10 man hards in 25 man gear) this is clearing Kara in Kara and heroic gear. <br />
<br />
The minor point you're missing is that the community is vastly more advanced than it was when BC was released. I remember looking for Kara strats online (because we were failing at it) and it being difficult to find good explanations. Today, there's professionally done bosskillers videos before the PTR is even over. There's a big difference there.</div></div><hr />

Man that is surely a spit in the face. Proc that is a fun gimmick on aoe pulls vs huge dps proc that also heals...? W t f.<br />
<br />
Also, everyone knows raiding throughout WotLK has been far too easy. First tier had 1 hard mode fight (granted it was pretty good). Second tier was pretty great tbh, but third just pathetic. Anub 25 HC dead first lockout? Did that happen much in the instances previously posted? No, no it did not.<br />
<br />
If ICC hard modes are made as challenging as Ulduar ones, Nibelung gets its proc rate normalized (not proccing from both blizzard, chill and frostbite for example, or from strange dots and what not but actually properly proccing of AM!) and increased (to 5% or something) and they NEVER EVER EVER EVER use this fucking retarded gating system that holds back hard modes for MONTHS. Then, I will be a happy camper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...<br />
The guilds like &quot;Ensidia&quot; are really special. It's not because they kill this boss in the SECOND lockout ( 100 try in one week because of a new server ) , with bugs ( soulstone 25 ppl ), with hotfix ( wrath holy ) who this means it's easy.<br />
<br />
For example, let's talk about Mimiron 25 Hardmode. They said this fight is epic, really hard, and really fun. They kill him &quot;fast&quot;, because they can play longer.<br />
<br />
<br />

Do not use too much spoil. Come, wipe, wipe again, read everything (logcombat..).</div></div><hr />

It may not be great for raiding but is still good for leveling while both Marks and Surv are competitive for raiding. I wouldn't expect any big changes for now.<br />
<br />
There's something I'd like you to suck.<br />
<br />
Oh well, this just confirms they fucked BM and have no plans to unfuck it despite all of that horse shit about &quot;Oh blah blah specs of the same roles should be equal blah blah blahhhhhhh&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks, jerks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HammondQ</div><div class="date">2009-12-25, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When BM was the top dog DPS spec, it was just a button masher(and still is). Probably the easiest DPS spec to play of any class.<br />
<br />
There is a little more thought that goes into playing the Modern revamped MM and SV specs. <br />
<br />
Modern MM and SV require that you actually move more than 2 fingers on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
If they were to buff BM they would have to give it a major overhaul like they did SV and MM.<br />
<br />
Blizzard stated previously they didnâ€™t want the easiest hunter tree to have the highest DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
So keeping with their philosophy they probably wont just Buff pet damage, or increase haste. <br />
<br />
If they were to buff BM to make it equal to SV/MM they would give it a complete overhaul and give it some depth. They gave the hunter trees a lot of attention this Expacâ€¦.so I donâ€™t really see them giving BM the amount of attention it would need to be competitive for a long time.</div></div><hr />
