Theramore to be destroyed by the Horde in 5.0?<br />
It seems that Theramore will be destroyed by the Horde in the pre-Mists of Pandaria world events, the info was revealed to a couple of taiwanese websites attending a press event with Tom Chilton. Translation from Curll on ScrollsOfLore (http://www.scrollsoflore.com/forums/showpost.php?p=368927&amp;postcount=43).<br />
<br />
聯盟部落的對立，要如何去強調？<br />
整個戰爭會從潘達利亞的迷霧資料片上市前會啟動世界事件，來強化 聯盟根部落的戰鬥，塞拉摩這城市摧毀讓聯盟 高層非常暴怒，也會以此為契機強化這兩方的戰鬥，未來整個戰鬥會 蔓延在潘達利亞*陸上，部落與聯盟也會在上 面發動許多的戰鬥以及與熊貓人的互動。<br />
<br />
Here's the original quote. Let me translate:<br />
The whole war will be ignited during the world event which leading the game into Mist of Pandaria. Theramore will be destroyed and the leaders of Alliance were outrageous at this matter and completely devote themselves into the war, which reach its peak on the continent of Pandaria. The Horde and the Alliance literally fought on the homeland of Pandaria, which pissed the pandarens off.<br />
<br />
部落跟聯盟都很喜歡去殺對方的首領，那熊貓人的首領怎麼算？<br />
在潘達利亞*陸上的 npc 多是中立角色，一部分的熊貓人覺得部落跟聯盟帶來厄運，並對它們 帶有敵意，玩家玩的熊貓人是早已脫離潘達利 亞的熊貓人，在等級達到之後選擇加入陣營，所以是沒有首領可以去 扁的。<br />
Most of the pandarens are neutral characters. And some of them thought the Horde and the Alliance only brought doom to their beloved homeland, and have enmity against both factions. The players pandarens are in a different group. They departed Pandaria long ago and choose their own path. They choose their own faction when level 10, so they don't have a faction leader.<br />

Free Diablo 3 and 12-Months WoW Subscription Plan<br />
We covered that a little during the opening ceremony but didn't really have time to clarify because of all the new MoP info raining down on us. A few important points:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
For a limited time only, players who make a 12-month subscription commitment to World of Warcraft through the WoW Annual Pass will receive the following epic rewards:<br />

Tyrael’s Charger WoW Flying Mount – Ride for the Archangel of Justice on all current and future characters on a single World of Warcraft account. Tyrael’s Charger will arrive via in-game mail with the upcoming launch of patch 4.3.<br />

<br />
This is a pretty good deal for anyone playing WoW, especially since the time between the last patch of Cataclysm and the beginning of Mists of Pandaria will probably much shorter than it was for WotLK/Cataclysm. <br />

You have to admit, those are pretty good cupcakes. <br />

Basicly if you decide to remove your card your end up getting banned and most likely something via the post telling you to pay it, its a contract after-all think of it like a 12 month phone contract! If you plan on playing for 12 months and want to try diablo and the beta its well worth it imo. Free mount is nice also but everyone on the server will have that mount who is 18+ so dont think your going to look cool riding it about. It will be as cool as a celestial steed or winged guardian!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You keep paying monthly, or every 3 or 6 months if you prefer. It just means you can't cancel your subscription for 12 months. If you are pretty sure you'd keep playing during that time anyway, it's a good deal.</div></div><hr />

yes, exept if you break the deal and suddenly stop paying during that 12month period you will be sued, much likely if you dont pay your internet or electrical bill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, i was on board with southshore. Surrounded by horde with no nearby alliance support. It should have falen long ago. But stonard is exact same thing as southshore, it's in an aliance prdominant area, with no horde support, and somehow alliance is too incompient to take out a hick horde town in middle of no where?<br />
<br />
to top it off, a major port to fall so easy is just silly. clearly the design teams feels aliance are so dumb an incompitant that they cant even take a horde hick town with no support in middle of no where when they have it surrounded, nor can they defend a hub with tons of support reinforcements and tactical advantage, being a navel port and jaina there being all types of mage awesome porting any invadors out of city into the middle of ocean. a town that in 4.0.3 was able to even push their troops forward into souther barrens. now they go from getting stronger to blatently incompitent?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xSaix</div><div class="date">2011-10-24, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The favoritism is exasperating, but I'm sadly used to it. The Alliance war cry has always been &quot;for the light&quot;, not &quot;we'll keep trying!&quot; Fail. Also nice job making it seem like Alliance is some pansy faction only baking cupcakes while Horde is HARDXCORE. It's bad enough at Blizzcon himself Chris Metzen said it was okay to boo at Alliance, and that in the Q&amp;A he favors Thrall and wants the most focus on him, when he is/was the leader of the Horde.

Basicly if you decide to remove your card your end up getting banned and most likely something via the post telling you to pay it, its a contract after-all think of it like a 12 month phone contract! If you plan on playing for 12 months and want to try diablo and the beta its well worth it imo. Free mount is nice also but everyone on the server will have that mount who is 18+ so dont think your going to look cool riding it about. It will be as cool as a celestial steed or winged guardian! <br />
<br />
Would be nice if only 18+ers can have the mount. (parents have themselves as owned and are 18+ =&gt; kids of 12 have the mount they whined about for 2 hours :p</div></div><hr />

Alliance... a district in Stormwind gets destroyed by deathwing. Worgen are robbed of their starting zone and city. Southshore gets destroyed by the Scourge/forsaken. Auberdine gets destroyed by elementals and a giant wave. Horde... Orgrimmar is not only untouched, but remodeled to be made stronger. Horde forces capturing vast areas of Ashenvale forest. they give the whole of Azshara to Goblins. Grom'gol is untouched in spite of being located just up the beach from booty bay that got half destroyed by a giant wave a couple of tents are burnt in southern Barrens. Scourge/Forsaken are pretty much given most of Lordaeron except for parts that are owned by the Argent Crusade, and a small refugee camp in Arathi. so far it looks like for the sixth expansion alliance players might need check with horde players if it is okay to log on and play on their server's. because i wouldn't put it past blizzard to transfer ownership of all of the servers to the horde.</div></div><hr />

Devs said at Blizzcon that soon, and they hoped by 5.0, there'd be some major action on the part of Varian to make us, like, want him to be our king. My guess is after Theramore falls he'll be out for blood, and Ally be on the counter-offensive</div></div><hr />

I don't think Jaina have THAT much control of Theramore anymore. Theramore people are expanding into Horde, Ogre, Centaur, Grimtotem territory, as if they were little lizards under rocks and foliage, to run away at the sound of their stomping. They are absolutely sure of themselves, and ignoring the sentience of anything in their path.<br />
NOTHING like Jaina, and by questing as Alliance in Theramore you learn that the military force is more rebel than before, and doing things first, telling about them to Jaina only if asked. And how Jaina will ask about things she doesn't know exists?</div></div><hr />

If you decide to purchase the Diablo III Collector's Edition when it's available, and then choose to add your Collector's Edition license key to the Battle.net account associated with your existing World of Warcraft Annual Pass promotion, you will receive all of the benefits associated with the Collector's Edition, plus receive four months of World of Warcraft game time which is eligible towards your 12-month subscription commitment. So glad they made it an attractive deal for us who wanted the D3 CE. It's a pretty damn good deal to be honest.

God knows the Horde have had enough victories without any kind of retaliation. Stonetalon, Ashenvale, the Barens, Anderhol, Hillsbrid, Arathi, Gilneas, Azshara. Compare that to the victory of what, the Night Elves beating the primitive trolls in Darkshore and a Tauren camp being burnt down, and thats about it.

Now if only the Alliance would sack a Horde equivelant on EK--maybe Tarren Mill (retaliation for Southshore) or Hammerfall and before anyone says it, Stormpike Outpost in Hillsbrad is still there despite Southshore falling to the Horde. What's to say Hammerfall/Tarren Hill being lost will effect that? No one goes to those Battleground entrances anymore these days.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they'll give us Alliance players more respect soon. During Blizzcon they mentioned a possible Alliance-only questline with Varian where he becomes really intense and cool (enough to rival Thrall, apparently). Also, they promised lots of Jaina and Tyrande being cool. This was while Chris M. kept shouting, &quot;For the Horde!&quot;, so maybe I should take this info with a grain of salt, lol, but I have hope.</div></div><hr />

We're gonna explode this scyscraper in return and it will be a fair trade!&quot; And taking gilneas and stormgarde back is not a gain, it was alliance capital city and an alliance fort. The whole idea that one of the major faction's capital city was under siege and HAS been lost even for a while is ridiculous. Where is the alliance attack on horde capital cities in return? I understand blizzard is desperately trying to incite the xfaction war, but so far they only succeeded to draw anger to themselves because this is seriously a &quot;wtf&quot; moment. And this ridiculous &quot;we'll keep trying&quot; and &quot;cupcakes&quot;.. Did blizz really made a goal to piss off whole the alliance player base? Well, *bleep* that.

<br />
If you put the CE on your account instead of the digital you don't get the digital (since you have the CE). D3 digital will by far obviously be $60 like everything else. They are giving you the money you would have saved by getting D3 digital free but in 4-months of WoW form.<br />
<br />
The only issue I have with it is if you save money with WoW by going with 3-6 month plans, you are getting less than $60 back when buying the CE. Though it could have been a worse deal where they just add 4 extra months at the end of your year.</div></div><hr />

Yup just like goblins use the dwarf one.<br />
<br />
My take on Theramore, Garrosh destroys it, Jaina freaks out, goes to Thrall when he comes back and takes over, he tosses Garrosh out for it and allows Varian to duel him in an arena in Orgrimmar and Varian kills Garrosh. Baine thanks Varian. Jaina is happy. Horde and Alliance join forces for the big yet unnamed baddie/race that is destroying Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;Choose Your Destiny&quot; thing is a fucking joke! Good LORD, learn to take one! 2. The video animations are more than likely placeholders that won't make it to retail. They have to show you SOMETHING! 3. Theramore was a place I rarely went to as Ally. I can see how this might be a bit TOO many Horde victories, and that it seems like Blizz ignored everything lore fans were telling them about the Cata storyline. But notice that it says that the Theramore thing is what brings it to a head. I don't think this is going to be the ONLY thing that actually happens leading up to the next pack. And where in that did it ever say the HORDE destroy the town? It probably will be, but that quote (if it was translated right) left out the WHO in that. With how Blizz has been loving the Old Gods lately, I wouldn't be too surprised if we see a third party trying to sabotage a faction into war because it's the only way the Old Gods can set their plans into motion after DW gets killed (since DW has been their biggest chance so far to bring the Hour of Twilight to a reality). I'm not sure if we end up killing all of them by the end of 4.3's events, but I'm sure there would be SOME higher power playing the role of warmonger that we know from previous Warcraft lore. Then again, I couldn't think of any other WC faction or character that would have motive to want to destroy the port town other than the Horde, though I could be wrong on that (and I probably am).</div></div><hr />

Man you guys should stop up and listen to yourself :p. All those alliance that are QQing about their lost city, grow up. Most Horde dont even care about Tharamore, in my case i wassent even sure what city it was. When i remembered where it was, i was like, do you still use it for anything? :O. If you care that much about that city, go get it back. As for stonard, you can have it...</div></div><hr />

BTW thankyou for that i don't think anyone from horde can take him on one vs one anymore... yes saurfang is strong and a good fighter but varian has alot of skill thats another reason thrall stopped garrosh from attacking varian in WotLK he knew garrosh would die and wanted him to be the next leader at that point. :) anyway yeah alliance leaders have more importaint things on their minds then fighting someone that should be helping us.</div></div><hr />

We're gonna explode this scyscraper in return and it will be a fair trade!&quot; <br />
<br />
You're right, of course - the fact that the horde are apparently going to attack and destroy an alliance military base such as the one you describe is nowhere near in the same ballpark as when the people of that military outpost attacked the nearby innocent, non-military village incapable of defending itself and slaughtered its civilian inhabitants consisting mainly of women, old men and traders. The Horde should really attack something else if they want to even up that score - although I doubt that it would ever do sanction anything so dishonourable.<br />

Then we find out a vague detail that some sort of unrelenting attack by the Horde on Theramore is to come.<br />
<br />
The Horde, to remind you, is currently a faction with an overzealous ruler and significant turmoil among their faction leaders; while the Alliance has almost never been quite so unified and far removed from the days of imprisoning orcs.The first pawn on the chess board of what is to be the story for Mists of Pandaria is being moved, and you're angry at whose turn is first? I only offer that maybe there's a little more to the Horde and Alliance story lines in Mists than an Alliance town being leveled... like the entire expansion story you don't know about yet. ;)<br />
<br />
If you wanna make an omelette...&quot;<br />
<br />
Quoted from Zarhym on the official WoW forums. Seems to confirm that something big will be happening at Theramore. But I also like that Zarhym basically tells people to chill out, because you don't even know the slightest bit about the rest of the story. It's hard to call Blizzard on Horde bias because this is not just an on-the-spot decision by Blizzard saying &quot;Oh, let's just make Horde win today.&quot; It's an overarching narrative, and you can count on the Alliance getting shots back.Now what I'm wondering is how this plays into Varian's progression as a leader, Jaina's role in the alliance war effort, and maybe even how players reach Pandaria. <br />
<br />
Would it be crazy to think that maybe the naval battle that puts us on Pandaria is fought not far from Theramore? I think the coolest thing would not just be to flat out destroy Theramore before the players finish installing MoP, but rather to have the siege of that city be interactive and let Alliance players try to save it before it finally falls.

I wouldn't be suprised if the horde (sorry, i mean the orcs&amp;goblins, as they are pretty much the only races left in the horde) will basically kick the alliance all the way back to the gates of stormwind, and then have Vol'jin finally assasinate Garrosh there like he promised he would, thereby putting an end to his rule and the war, or something along those lines.We already know that Garrosh will likely be killed in this expansion or the next, when you make a big scene about one leader promising to kill another one, you gotta make something of it, right? Come to think of it, that opens up the option of having a &quot;siege of stormwind&quot; raid instance. Alliance want to go in and kill Garrosh to end the war, and Horde wants to go in and kill Garrosh in order to end the war and save the horde from him, and it would also give both sides a chance to kill off Sylvanas, who was hinted at working to reforge frostmourne.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is exactly what happens, she actually dies in the attack. There is nothing Thrall can do to stop the Alliance from attacking. Garrosh purposefully targeted her, because with her dead, Thrall´s ability to stop the war is gone. With Garrosh having so many victories in Cataclysm and destroying Theramore AND now having the Alliance attacking.. very little ability for Thrall to reclaim warchief.<br />

<br />
Erm... They giving fucking horde one more victory over alliance without any compensation?? That's beyond pathetic.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked this was an RPG, not a dps meter. The devs in no way have to keep things éxactly´ even for RP purposes. You get the same number of mounts, same classes and races, and racials are mostly balanced. It is stupid to think that the storytellers have to balance the number of rp victories each side has. ´omg, you took our lvl 20 quest hub.. now.. er.. we must destroy one of their lvl 20 quest hubs.´ Really? that is how you want the people telling the story to think? For gameplay matters, I am sure the number of quests for those zones will remain the same, your leveling experience won´t change.</div></div><hr />

Yes you can py in 1,3, or 6 month increments or with time cards just like before.<br />

Basically, you can continue paying for your subscription the same way you have, except you cannot cancel your account for 12 months. So, you can change payment plans, change credit cards, etc., just like you have done up to this point, but they will not give you the option to cancel your subscription until AFTER the 12 months have passed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More importantly, your existing time credit counts towards the 12 months. Your sole obligation is to remain subscribed to WoW for one year from the date you accepted the Annual Pass contract. So if you paid for 6 months on September 24th, then took out a pass today, you would only have to pay for seven months more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive actually bought the annual sub because of the following reasons.<br />
<br />
1. Its cheaper than buying time cards off amazon.<br />
2. I have the funds<br />
3. It means ill be able to play or not play as i wish but i have the knowlege that i CAN pick up and play any time without having to worry if my time has expired.<br />
4. I would have bought D3 and its selling for £30 on amazon<br />
5. Free mount and beta access<br />
<br />
I dont really care about pandas one way of the other, but I like WoW - Ive been playing since 2005. I generally play for several months and often take a few month off when i feel bored. <br />
I bought and played Warhammer, aion, GW, Heroes online and others but yet Ive grown bored with them VERY quickly and always come back to WoW.<br />
<br />
for me the deal was a good one. <br />
If you take point 4 alone it works out that I'm only actually paying for 6 months wow game time but I'm getting 12 months</div></div><hr />

felwick makes a very valid point. If u don't approve of what blizzard is doing dont just rage on the forums actually do something about it. by the way all u people keep raging its obvious ur gna keep playing the game which is proly how blizz rates how good a job they do. since its obvious this expansion pack is going to be pvp focused dont do anything pvp related. it just makes sense guys</div></div><hr />

Also I do not think 12 months annual wow pass is for making Diablo 3 cheaper. It as they said at Blizzcon: ppl who play do not have to make a huge change and spend a lot of money to play Blizzards new game, they are giving them this game for free. Lots of WoW players will play Diablo 3 eventually, why not making it easier for them and also making sure they will still play WoW? I think it was an excellent idea for both Blizzard and players. Making Collectors Edition available for them was nice move too. I am sure I will play both games, since i love wow and i have been waiting for diablo 3 for ages now :)</div></div><hr />
