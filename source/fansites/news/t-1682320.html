Hand of Freedom Places a Hand on the friendly target, granting immunity to movement impairing effects for 6 sec. Players may only have one Hand on them per Paladin at any one time. Usable while stunned. 7% of Base Mana. 40 yd range. Instant. 25 sec cooldown.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this some tooltip fix or does it mean you can freedom yourself OUT OF STUNS? ...you have been able to freedom yourself/others while stunned since forever (?) atleast in WotLK, cant remember if you could in TBC.</div></div><hr />

What are you referring to? Which one works, and what change are you referring to? The only Illusion tooltip changes I saw were removing any specifications listed. (Red means it was removed)</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, I guess you're right. I totally forgot that red means it was removed.<br />
<br />
There is an Illusion that works on a few guns, Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle (http://www.wowhead.com/item=28581/wolfslayer-sniper-rifle) being one of them, I don't remember which one, though.<br />

It's not an update, it's a whole other copy of the game. They can't just patch your game, otherwise it would be incompatable with the live version.<br />
<br />
OT: Holy shit that hand of freedom buff. No way that's getting through, I mean speaking as a Paladin myself it would be amazing if it did, but with clemancy, that gives you 3 get out of stun cards from the get go, then another every 25 seconds. That's hillariously OP. Might have to get the PTR myself just to go troll some rogues.</div></div><hr />

Well that sucks, but of course they can. Thats what they have been doing for every single, PTR, Beta, and Live version of the game, they simply update it, no one is forced to re-download the entire game every update. The very thought of that terrifies me.</div></div><hr />

That's not what I meant, obviously when they patch it they replace files or add new ones. I was on about the fact that you need to have a seperate copy for the PTR or Beta to start with(which have their own seperate patches), or you wouldn't be able to play live as your files will have been changed, rendering it unplayable with the live version. <br />
<br />
What would be nice would the ability to copy and paste your game and then manually point the PTR in the direction of that second version, but I assume there's a reason they don't do that.</div></div><hr />

Right i understand that, i do have a separate copy from Live and PTR, but for some reason my PTR version of the game is downloading 22gb. I was just on the PTR prior to this latest update, seems a bit excessive to download the entire PTR all over again.</div></div><hr />

Oh, my apologies, misunderstanding where each other were coming from, it would appear :) I assumed you were new to the whole PTR malarky. Well crap, that's wierd, last PTR was WoD launch patch wasn't it, there's no reason for a new copy of the client. Are you downloading direct from the site or through B.net updater? When I updated my PTR from MoP to WoD, it just patched it through the B.net launcher. Unfortunetly I don't have the PTR myself or I'd check for you.</div></div><hr />

Considering Alchemy in its current form is completely useless, no. Ask any Alchemist and they'll either say they stopped making Catalysts or that there is no use for them other than making upgraded flasks.<br />
<br />
On live there are no Transmute recipes and the current Alchemy Trinket is a lousy 620 un-upgradeable blue item.</div></div><hr />

Iirc this was a response made in the EU forums, though? You know, where the blues actually aren't devs, their forwarded feedback isn't taken into consideration by the actual devs and they still sometimes make responses like if they had any idea of what's going on at blizz HQ. :P</div></div><hr />

why the nerf to scavengers? what purpose did that serve? Seems really dumb IMO. Scavengers were the only followers i have and now i am pretty much useless</div></div><hr />

On live there are no Transmute recipes and the current Alchemy Trinket is a lousy 620 un-upgradeable blue item.<br />
Hey, now... Don't let the color and item level trick you, the 620 alch trinket is better than quite a few dungeon and LFR trinkets. (Not so sure where Normal-difficulty trinkets are concerned, it may still outstrip a couple at that level depending on the player's setup.)<br />

Considering how horrible 99% of your ideas/arguments are on these forums, I would say please god no. to both those options.<br />
<br />
OT: reducing Scavenger to 100% is stupid as hell. Scavenger is the only thing making Garrisons supplies somewhat usable without having to have a lumber mill.<br />
<br />
It will make Alts even more horrendous to level.</div></div><hr />

I guesss you defend Ashran having 5 hours queue and unbalanced population?<br />
<br />
Having PvE spells be nerfed because of PvP?<br />
<br />
What a progressive mind you yield.<br />
<br />
Even before the Bonus Objectives system was implemented, back in MoP - i shared the same ideas on the forums.<br />
<br />
Guess what, they are pretty damn awesome.<br />

<br />
It may seem that this is indeed the first expansion you are leveling alts, because it has never been that swift and easy to do so. Unless you go superrushmode with all of your alts at the same time, where you may encounter some bottlenecks for a while with resources, I have to say that I am drowning in resources on any of my alts after a VERY short time. Every single char had way over 2k resources when it came to level the garrison to level 2 and enough resources to build almost everyting from scracth at level 100. (maybe you lack some of the level 3 1,2k resources for your 2nd big building, but that's largly it.<br />
I also did a quick count in our guild going from a very casual big playerbase, to very commited people in mythic gear. The general concencus is the same over various stages of timeinvestment/gameplaystyle. Of course this is still not a relevant sample size, but it goes to show that it cannot be as terrible as you make it seem for arguments sake.<br />
It is in fact the only thing that takes a little time to advance your alt with, as anything else is almost instantanious access, let alone the superfast leveling on it's own.<br />
Please do not overexagerate your argument, just to make it seem somewhat more relevant.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is aware of the issue. A post was put out even before the PTR came back up.<br />
Hey all,<br />
<br />
We're still in the process of deploying the latest build (19480) to PTR realms but unfortunately there are significant issues with the Mac version of this build. <br />
<br />
When updating via a Mac OS, the Battle.Net App may hang at &quot;Fetching Encoding table&quot;, or a similar message. It's possible PC users may get stuck here as well, but our testing indicates that the PC update will eventually go through. <br />
<br />
Additionally, if you are able to patch up a Mac client I wanted to let you know ahead of time there's some Mac-specific UI issues. These issues were caught several days ago, but weren't able to be fixed before this build was generated.<br />
<br />
Apologies for any inconvenience.</div></div><hr />

why the nerf to scavengers? what purpose did that serve? Seems really dumb IMO. Scavengers were the only followers i have and now i am pretty much useless<br />
<br />
I have only 3 of scavengers and since 2 weeks on cap by 10k resources.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaigar</div><div class="date">2015-01-19, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More Monk nerfs... Wheres my surprise face.<br />
<br />
I got a feeling eminence nerf will impact Xuen. Xuen procs eminence even if you are in serpent stance. Vs. single target, he can heal anywhere from 150k-200k over 45 seconds on average.<br />
<br />
Mana tea nerf is pretty dumb. I'm currently logged out in my PvP gear and unsubbed so I can't check my PvE stats, but with 632 ilvl and spirit on all items possible except trinkets and cloak, with a 660 spirit PvP ring, the 680 legendary quest ring, and 620 pvp neck (61 spirit, best neck from BRF has 123 as a comparison).<br />
<br />
I'm sitting on 1032 spirit. Thats 4128 mana per tea. Current mana tea gives a static 6400 mana (7.68k with ascension). That means to break even on mana tea mana regen, I'd need 1600 spirit. Even if I have 2 passive spirit trinkets (Mark of Rapid Replications, 346 spirit at 670, Grandiose Pendant, 183 spirit), I wouldn't break even. If you have say, 685 trinket (398 spirit), 695 neck (123 spirit), 695 ring (106 spirit), 695 cloak (115 spirit) and the 690 ring (120 spirit), thats +862 spirit, and with a base at level 100 of 784, thats 1646. In the best gear, you just barely get better mana regen than you do now, meaning those in less gear are worse. Now you can't even get close to what you need to match current ascension (1920 spirit), so that passive is even more unusable.</div></div><hr />
