Camera Zoom Distance Limit Increase<br />
Blizzard is raising the zoom limit to halfway between what it used to be and what it is now. <br />
We’ve been closely following the discussion around 7.0.3 camera changes, and especially feedback regarding specific sources of visual and physical discomfort. We recently released a client hotfix that addressed a number of mount-related camera issues, and we have another update in the works that addresses screen/FOV distortion resulting from addons that alter the viewport. Many developers on the WoW team are sensitive to various forms of motion and simulation sickness, and it’s an issue about which we care deeply. The last thing we want is for anyone who loves the game to feel unable to enjoy it due to physical discomfort. <br />
<br />
Obviously, the cap on CVar-controlled max zoom distance has been a major focus of both community and our own internal discussions. My original post on the matter was not as clear as it could have been regarding our motivations for the change in the first place. It placed too much emphasis on “competitive advantage” in terms of a level playing field, when the core concern I was trying to convey is that “whatever the maximum allowed, that’s what competitive players will use in order to maximize performance, even at the expense of the game’s overall look and feel.” That shouldn’t be a terribly controversial statement: When you’re trying to dodge Fel Outpouring waves on Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel, the farther out you can zoom, the sooner you can see when they’re headed your way; why wouldn’t you zoom out as far as possible? (Corollary: Around what expected zoom level do we tune the speed and lethality of the waves?)<br />
<br />
In the course of working on Legion, and trying to improve the overall look and feel of our combat, class abilities, and the ways in which players interact with the world, we took stock of all aspects of that experience, including the camera. World of Warcraft is an avatar-driven open-world RPG, placing the player in the shoes of a hero who adventures throughout Azeroth, yet with the previous max console zoom, that hero would commonly take up less screen real estate than characters in isometric games like Diablo or Heroes, or even many Starcraft 2 units. At that zoom level, details of your character get lost, and details in the world vanish. The game ultimately is designed to be experienced with the camera zoom range available in the default UI. <br />
<br />
Now, that is not to say that we don’t at times fail in creating an overall experience that is smooth and free of frustration at those zoom levels. When a tank can’t see around a boss like Archimonde to know where incoming demons are in order to corral them, that’s obviously not ideal. There is much we can do to keep WoW’s scale from spiraling out of control, as well as UI and camera improvements to the experience of fighting huge monsters, and we’ll be paying close attention to feedback along those lines as we move into Legion.<br />
<br />
We intended to limit the console-overridden camera zoom very early on in the Legion Beta, which would have left us with many months to iterate on gameplay and feedback that arose from the change before releasing Legion. However, due to an oversight (we capped one way of overriding it, but not another) the change did not properly go through until the very end of the development cycle. Since then, we’ve heard from many players that they’ve relied on increasing the camera zoom to counteract a number of sensitivities, ranging from motion sickness to headaches from spell effects. <br />
<br />
Recently, a number of players have reported some relief through using a new addon that allows them to bypass any and all limits on zoom distance. That addon takes advantage of a bug that has existed for some time but gone unnoticed (passing a negative value into a function). In an upcoming hotfix, we will be fixing that bug and thus causing that addon (and others like it) to honor the standard camera limits. <br />
<br />
However, in that same hotfix, we will also be raising the hard cap on camera zoom to a midway point between what was possible prior to 7.0, and what is possible through the in-game interface options. This increased cap will allow power users to once again be able to extend their camera distance via a console command, should they so desire. The choice of the new max was informed by reports from players regarding what zoom distance eased the discomfort they were experiencing. Ultimately, we would prefer to address the underlying issues rather than relying on increased zoom to mask those issues, but now that patch 7.0.3 is live and we cannot properly iterate on the sort of changes that would be required, reapplying the band-aid is preferable to leaving an open wound.<br />
<br />
We look forward to hearing your feedback once these changes are live. We want to continue working to improve the readability, usability, and accessibility of our game from a visual standpoint, including camera functionality, and community feedback and discussion are invaluable when dealing with such an inherently subjective area.<br />

This guy knows what's up. The further your camera is from your character, the more of a competitive advantage you have but the less you feel attached to your character. Well, at least I do.

As long as you play well you will not be kicked. Competitive guilds will not care how far your camera is zoomed out.</div></div><hr />

Just FYI - we've been able to for the past week due to the new addon. The max I've heard someone play with is 70 yards, and that was just to see if he could. Everyone who downloaded and used the addon that I've spoken to and asked haven't gone above 50 yards for comfortable play - which pretty much disproves the entire &quot;WHATEVER THE MAX IS, PLAYERS WOULD USE THAT FOR ADVANTAGE!&quot;-bullshit that Watcher has been clinging to. We have the ability to zoom out as far as we could ever want right now - and we're sticking to what we're *used to*, because it's comfortable, advantage notwithstanding.</div></div><hr />

you can do that, you're still wrong though, that's why an addon gained such big attention and made blizzard back down again and give us more distance with our cameras.<br />

aren't those casuals the ones paying me for their heroic/mythic archimonde boost because they're not good enough to kill it, or don't even try or just give up half way through HFC normal?<br />
<br />
your point is fucking ridiculous because people may be ignorant and don't know things about the game others should have things removed/nerfed to these &quot;casual wow players&quot; <br />
<br />
yeh some casuals won't step foot in a raid, some won't bother with the legendary questline, some won't upgrade their gear, some won't do pet battles, lets remove everything these casuals don't do bring the raiders down to their level, sounds like a disaster.<br />

<br />
The limit was always 50, not knowing the command pretty much just means you didn't need it in the first place.<br />
And instead of giving everyone the knowledge or the possibility to raise their maxCdistance, enjoying the qol upgrade, they catered to the uninformed/handicapped, punishing those who have the knowledge/capabilities.<br />
It's like taxing the rich more because the majority don't want to put in the effort to learn a new/efficient way of making money, or they don't care.<br />
<br />
tl:dr: step up your game instead of complaining about those who did</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeh i'm not going to discuss the thousands of decisions where the playerbase is wrong/right and the same with blizzard, this is about the camera distance and like flying the playerbase is right, you don't remove things for dumb reasons, maybe if blizzard played the game to a good standard they would realise why it matters, and thats melee fighting a boss thats 50ft tall and just completely obscures your view of everything, it's not skill when you can't see anything, and flying was basically &quot;promised&quot; and it's expected and i think blizzard just got lazy and couldn't be bothered to add it, so they could work more on legion, well blizzard need to get a slap on the ass when they're naughty and the playerbase don't let them get away with bad/lazy decisions.<br />
<br />
of course there are many who would just play the game and never complain, those are the sheep that should never talk to anyone on mmo-c if you think blizzard should be able to just change whatever they want and we should just be happy and accept it thats stupid. criticism is required and sometimes blizzard doesn't listen, well a lot of the times blizzard don't thats why class balance often gets so terrible, so we have to resort to extremes to be heard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
of course there are many who would just play the game and never complain, those are the sheep that should never talk to anyone on mmo-c if you think blizzard should be able to just change whatever they want and we should just be happy and accept it thats stupid. criticism is required and sometimes blizzard doesn't listen, well a lot of the times blizzard don't thats why class balance often gets so terrible, so we have to resort to extremes to be heard.<br />

Don't waste your breath man, you are arguing with ppl who don't raid past normal. 11 post-capped thread in the offical forums showed that anyone who argues against reverting this change have no idea where the problem lies.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the new Action cam wont work past a certain distance and that's why they changed it in the first place. They wouldn't want to make it easy to change the settings to the max because then people would have problems with the Action Cam. If that's true its pretty disingenuous to try to come up with some other reason for reducing the max distance you can zoom out.</div></div><hr />

Anyhow, Blizzard did the right thing.<br />
Things like camera/vision in games needs to be properly discussed before being randomly changed to some random number.<br />
Not only does is impact the feel of the world (No, I don't see WoW as a character driven MMO, I view it as a world driven MMO), it can cause big displeasure and even health issues just changing it.<br />
They should change encounters/spells to show their resolution to the advantage that more vision would give, not the zooming out itself.</div></div><hr />

You're going to tell me that there's a single raid boss in, let's say, heroic HFC that can be successfully done by a group of players at regular camera distance? There isn't. Despite what the blues say, the game doesn't and hasn't worked that way, not even in vanilla. There are bosses in Ahn'Qiraj and Molten Core that are so large that regular camera zoom won't get you past their thighs.<br />
<br />
I'll concede that that's more of an argument for shrinking the scale of boss fights than it is an argument for huge field of view. But since they presumably aren't going to be rewriting all the boss encounters of the past 6 expansions to account for a smaller FoV, and it isn't very fun or fair to try to catch players both coming and going on the issue, then the most reasonable solution is just to let players play how they've been playing.</div></div><hr />

That they might lose there position on something that really shouldn't be a talking point in the relevant circles. It's dishonest beyond belief and only serves to bring down those who for whatever reason choose to want play with that zoom. Be it to perform better, to see more or just simply enjoying the option to do it. OPTION being the key here.<br />
<br />
What to do you really gain for shitting on people that liked what was there, that you opted in to of your own choice. If the complaint is coming from a position of &quot;I want to raid at the best I can and join the best team that I can but I want to make concessions on my part&quot; then you need to get over that fact it is the best choice for those that want to perform at their desired level. Like it or not the standard of play over the years has gone up as well as what should be expected of players at every different level of play. Make peace with that, don't shit on other people for it in a salty rage.</div></div><hr />

For one, how would they know?

The max I've heard someone play with is 70 yards, and that was just to see if he could. Everyone who downloaded and used the addon that I've spoken to and asked haven't gone above 50 yards for comfortable play - which pretty much disproves the entire &quot;WHATEVER THE MAX IS, PLAYERS WOULD USE THAT FOR ADVANTAGE!&quot;-bullshit that Watcher has been clinging to. We have the ability to zoom out as far as we could ever want right now - and we're sticking to what we're *used to*, because it's comfortable, advantage notwithstanding.<br />
<br />
That's only true to an extent. I'd say it would be a pretty fair guess to say if we only ever had the current max view distance, people wouldn't give extending it a 2nd thought. You'd ask the fights to be designed around it. <br />
<br />
A similar thing you could compare it to is other camera issues on fights. Such as inconveniently placed ceilings or banners. You didn't ask for the ability to use an addon to delete the banner or wall (or see through it), it was to tell them to design the room better. <br />
<br />
So I would more consider people not using a 70 yard range just to being used to 50 for years. Eventually people probably would've become accustomed to 70 if it became helpful on a fight. (Raid leading spoils maybe?)<br />
<br />
Now IMO the genie is out of the bottle and whatever advantage to enjoyment people would gain by playing closer in (which I would not be so quick to dismiss) is completely overwritten by the old max range being considered so important by so many to their enjoyment that they should've left it alone. However the compromise could work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then how the hell do you explain Fel Reaver, Archimonde, and a slew of other GIANT bosses that you can't fully see with CVar?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I can make the argument that the old max distance is more immersive. Being able to see the entire monster you're killing and then comparing how big they are to you gives their size actual weight instead of seeing kneecaps and cankles. Being able to see the actual world around me instead of just my immediate surroundings will always be my preference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derzorvadur</div><div class="date">2016-08-05, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For years now Blizzard has portrayed this attitude that they &quot; know what's best for us &quot; and routinely dismiss the very clearly defined outcries to their various changes. In many cases they have made changes to things that no one had issues with in the first place and then proceeded to patronize us when we fought against it by attempting to justify them with bullshit reasoning that made little to no logical sense. With this particular issue it was something that a large percentage of the playerbase had been using for several expansions now and it's never been discussed by anyone, ever. Deverloper or player in any serious capacity. If it were something that was truly detrimental to everyone's gameplay experience why hadn't even talked about it prior to their original out of the blue change recently? <br />
<br />
The truth is that it wasn't something that hindered players who didn't know about it by giving some massive advantage to those that did. Even with the view distance macro over the years some boss models and room designs were still a nightmare to navigate through. This change, along with several others is a culmination in design philosphy that Blizzard has developed where they feel like they know what's best for us and we can't handle having all these choices so they need to make them for us. (Your name plates should be this big and show only this information. Your raid frames should look like this and show only this information. You don't need all these extra Interface options, we'll get rid of those. Your camera should sit right here. You should use this spec for single target, and only this one for AoE. etc etc ) And while the vocal minority in most cases doesn't account for 80+% of the total playerbase, it does showcase the most passionate and dedicated group that's willing to fight for what they want. If I were a developer I would value the vocal minority over a group of players who can't even be bothered to take 2 minutes to send out a tweet much less an articulated forum post.</div></div><hr />

It's not going back to what it used to be but it's at least something. Understandable with their reasoning of motion sickness and other issues but still a pain to deal with all of a sudden for those of us who used the console commands.<br />

For gods sake he even words it in this post, we found 'RELIEF' using the ad-don because being super zoomed in is just shit. They should just give up on this weird ass 'anti-choices' campaign they have going on and let us play how we want already. <br />

Seriously a lot of the choices recently seem to be about standardising everything. The customisation of wow has always been one of its strongest points, Why 'fix' what wasn't broken and was actually great?</div></div><hr />

They have to balance encounters after this variable, though. Playing zoomed in when lethal stuff approach you off-screen is true hard mode. There is no real option, play zoomed out and pretend you're in WC3 or be confined to normal/LFR.</div></div><hr />

1. Competitive advantage, which he corrected himself by stating in the second post that it was not on of the main reasons.<br />
2. Hidden Options, then why make the new max only accessible by console?<br />
3. Not the way its meant to be played.<br />
<br />
From a designers perspective, this reasoning is not even that far off, but still a very weak point in a MMO that succeeded because of its great customization, especially when it has been around for so long.<br />
Also, why is he keeping to compare it to Starcraft? I'm not even sure if he knows that he is working on a MMO-RPG, we are meant to be only mere small dots on a screen of hundreds if not thousands of players at once (at peak events for example). I cant stop thinking that they are trying more and more to make WoW into a singleplayer with these choices, (very zoomed in) solo scenarios without any player interaction and story revolving solely around you/your shining character that covers half of the screen.</div></div><hr />

The really funny thing is that lack of zoom was one of the big launch complaints about SC2 from the RTS crowd, it's been a pretty standard RTS option for years now, it's only really Blizzard still producing RTS games like it's the 90's.</div></div><hr />

Sounds fun playing the game like that &quot; forced/kicked&quot; . On the other hand , my wife somethimes forces me to stop playing games or i get kicked out of the house .But if she keeps doing that ill be forced to kick her for another wife that plays games this time ;-) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, just like that time where they changed everything behind 6.2 because part of the playerbase was too tired of fighting Orcs, which led to a wonderful patch, with amazing lore and a fitting conclusion to the expansion... right?<br />
<br />
The playerbase knows jack. For every player who wants something, there's a player that wants the opposite. There will always be people complaining and crying, so the might as well stop caving in to QQ and crying and make the game THEY want to play. Whoever likes it, plays it. Whoever doesn't can leave. At least we'll have some coherence and better quality for those that do like it.</div></div><hr />

Just don't tell anyone how far zoomed in you are...? If it's not impeding your ability to raid, I don't see a problem. If it is impeding your ability to raid, surely you understand that it's reasonable to allow for a little more zooming than what is currently available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. But then again, it really wasn't that much of a big deal. For once because the difference is not that huge as some people make it seem to be, and because many boss rooms barely even actually allow you to use the max interface zoom properly (let alone CVAR max), as it will just stop zooming when it hits the walls or ceiling. But also because it really is more than enough, and it would at least give them a better chance of not making ridiculously sized bosses in the first place.<br />
<br />
And the feel of the game might be subjective, but the way a certain feature/setting takes effect ont he feel of the game tends to be similar to most players.</div></div><hr />

Apparently u are in a casual guild and mostly likely playing ranged class, otherwise, u wouldn't say stupid things like that. Or do you have fun (if you playing melee) to stare at bosses feet and not be aware of your surroundings cuz big fat boss is blocking your view almost entirely? And if you think you are special and want to do things your own way in competitive mythic high-end raiding then mythic guild and mythic raiding are not for you. On mythic progression, you work as a team, and you put your team in front everything else, u can't be selfish and say things like &quot;oh I don't like DBM, rather kick me&quot;.</div></div><hr />

OT: Someone will make a new tool and if not progress raid leaders will just have to get bigger monitors/multiple of them, this bandaid fix has not solved any made up problems, it just shifted them from a command into having a bigger screen to see more than others (or enjoy the world as you want....).</div></div><hr />

It's all cuz of filthy casuals bro. They somehow got a fake sense of disadvantage with this console command for max camera distance.

I don't see how this has to do with &quot;confidence in their product&quot; as if they are unsure players would like some slick new dungeon they just released or something.

<br />
of course there are many who would just play the game and never complain, those are the sheep that should never talk to anyone on mmo-c if you think blizzard should be able to just change whatever they want and we should just be happy and accept it thats stupid. criticism is required and sometimes blizzard doesn't listen, well a lot of the times blizzard don't thats why class balance often gets so terrible, so we have to resort to extremes to be heard.<br />

This kind of comment really annoys me. They're not telling us how to play the game. They're giving us more flexibility to choose for ourselves. It was LIMITING the zoom which was a case of them telling us how we are supposed to enjoy the game. This is the OPPOSITE. They are GIVING us a greater choice of zooms again.<br />

oh yes its sooooo very bad. Its only been in the game for 12 damn years. But only now will it effect the game /facedesk<br />
<br />
If people like the more zoomed in camera. There is the option to you know, not zoom out. I am willing to bet most of the people saying it should remain are casters, and definatly not tanks. I wonder how long it will be before these same people were screaming for the game to be changed back when they got killed by adds the tank couldnt see due to a limited ability to see whats going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and they were not wrong - mythic raiders had unfair advantage with bigger field of vision and the moment they lost that advantage they whined like little bitches that they will have to play the same way as those lfr scrubs - this is one of very many things that should be remoed from game toghether with addons like exorsus raid tools, dbm , logs etc etc in order to make game better for majority - but blizzard emplyes seems retard-fixed on catering to 1 % of nolifers - legion will be as shitty as wod if they dont change this attitude.</div></div><hr />

There's a major difference between &quot;Listen to everything the player base says&quot; and &quot;Listen to what the player base sense when it makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
This falls far into the making sense category. The limited view basically means melee are staring at boss ankles only. Also, there have been tons of players, and apparently developers too by their own words, effected negatively by the close up view. Why the hell they feel the need to make it a console command instead of just part of the core tool feature is beyond me.<br />

At the end of the day, stop trying to act like Blizzard is always right and the player base is always wrong, because that's just not the case.</div></div><hr />

However, it is good if they can use it to reduce people's discomfort by playing the game, so in the end it's a useful thing that way.<br />

Actually, the arguments against flying aren't real either and have been plucked apart numerous times (which is why Blizzard changed their minds). <br />

People just see that &quot;Blizzard said it's bad&quot;, and then these turncoats suddenly have spent their entire WoW career being oppressed by optional features and how OTHERS choose to play and enjoy the game...<br />
I bet you 100 dollars that if Blizzard made a statement tomorrow that they're removing PVP because reasons, you'd have these turncoats come forward with all the ways that PVP ruined their gameplay experience and &quot;it's not the way the game is meant to be played&quot;... despite them playing on PVE servers and never getting a single honorable kill...<br />

<br />
Reasons for no flying.<br />
<br />
1.) It trivializes a ton of content.<br />
2.) Makes the world smaller, but &quot;look&quot; bigger. Fixed by having lots of high level shots to view the world.<br />
3.) They added a fuck ton of FP's and a boat load of items that helped to simulate flying in short bursts. They also added a Mage Tower, and a other items bound by profession to move across the map quickly.<br />
<br />
Reasons for Flying<br />
<br />
1.) I want it.<br />
2.) I have flying mounts.<br />
<br />
Yeah, try again. Nothing has been plucked apart, because it's a subjective opinion. Little twats cried for months because they couldn't trivialize content by flying, and Blizz just caved on it. <br />
<br />
Now we are getting the same treatment in Legion, but we aren't getting any fucking help to move around the map quickly because they know flying is coming.</div></div><hr />

^^ took the words out of my mouth. I for one am stoked about these changes because the new zoom (even with a max slider) triggered my vertigo at times and gave me splitting headaches, made me feel like everything was spinning, and easily cut my ability to play in half (in regards to how long I could sit and play without needing to stop). I just wanted to be able to zoom out another 15-20 yards and hopefully this will be right on the money. I've used the console command since I can remember but I rarely played with it fully extended. <br />
<br />
I guess bringing up these concerns in the forums because I want to be able to play Legion for more than 3-4 hours at a time, and expansion that I feel is going to be the best one since WotLK and BC after playing in the beta, was me whining though. El oh well! /whiner /crybaby</div></div><hr />

Yes, they are giving something back, but it comes off as being &quot;well, ok, I guess we need to do something here&quot; rather than a &quot;ok, we were wrong, here it is back.&quot; They say at the end there that they would rather be able to fix other aspects, but they can't, so this is a band-aid. Only because of the physical discomfort some people feel. It has nothing to do with any other reason. If it wasn't because of the discomfort part, they wouldn't be doing this. To me, that says they don't care about the other reasons people have for zooming the camera out farther.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, try a different song, I've heard it all before. Your arguments are the same old kool-aid inspired tripe, completely ignoring FACTS such as that the world feels small if it IS small. It feels trivial if it IS trivial, which has been true once we reach max level since the dawn of time not due to flying, but due to power creep and outleveling mobs. We've gotten zones and world content that didn't feel small or trivial despite flying just fine before (Krasarang during 5.1 for example), and no flying didn't make Draenor feel any less small or trivial. <br />
<br />
Go play an mmorpg which didn't have flying for most of its lifetime if it bothers you so damned much. Blizzard listened to the constructive feedback they got, and COMPROMISED. Like adults do. Now we'll have flying in mainland expansion zones once the content is purely outdated, and those of us that love flying in a FANTASY world, can have our fill.</div></div><hr />

That does not prevent YOU from playing how you feel it should be played. You can zoom back to max allowed default, hell, you can even play first person view if you wish.

So...they will resize Ysera in emerald dream raid? I wouldnt be counting for it<br />
i can bet on it that there will be encounters that will punish mele classes regardless on how tall boss will be<br />
and the camera distance would be perfect to counter disadvantage and yet, the ppl have will use addons to show them where to stand, move or what to do instead of their own sight... that is sick.</div></div><hr />

Haha so fking delusional. Why don't u go back to farming mounts and doing pet battles? Addons only enhance your gameplay they don't move your character for you. IDK how can you even discuss this matter considering u haven't cleared HFC on heroic. And now when all that disadvantage which was the only reason u didn't win race for the world first is gone, LFR heroes, mount collectors, and Pokemon trainers can finally win the world race!! :D</div></div><hr />

god damnit, tell me a game that you can get more zoom out of the slider???<br />
<br />
if the zoom level goes from 1-100 the in game slider is 1-50 and macro does 50-100<br />

why not just make the slider 1-100 ? it cant be that hard.</div></div><hr />

Because its experimental camera zoom. Zones are not done to handle that zoom. Roofs, Clifs, places where the camera can clip. etc.<br />

The rationale behind the original change was solid. The problem was that people were used to the larger zoom, so it was not well received.

11+ years to go yeh we really need to reduce the zoom which will piss some players off, and the ones who don't use it are unaffected, it's a genius plan, blizzard should try listening sooner and stop making changes that only negatively affect the game like removing flying, i like the way it is you do all the content in the game by ground, but later on you get that flying luxury it encourages you to do more especially on alts, but not adding it was a stupid idea with backlash, just like this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasn't though, I was able to do it without anything outside of the product delivered by blizzard. It was a default console command within the base game. Unlike DBM which is still allowed.<br />
<br />
If you want to have a serious conversation, then talk about the Addons like DBM that aren't known to all players yet give a blatant advantage and are still allowed.<br />
<br />
I personally don't have anything against things like DBM, but if the argument is that &quot;not everyone knows about the zoom command&quot; then I can easily make that same argument for DBM etc. And if you are just going to parrot blizzard without coming up with anything yourself then I don't see the point in having this conversation.<br />

<br />
Reasons for no flying.<br />
<br />
1.) It trivializes a ton of content.Questing is already trivial. It's hilarious that you don't think that it is. If you stuggle with questing, maybe this isn't the game for you.<br />
<br />
2.) Makes the world smaller, but &quot;look&quot; bigger. Fixed by having lots of high level shots to view the world.Subjective<br />
<br />
3.) They added a fuck ton of FP's and a boat load of items that helped to simulate flying in short bursts. They also added a Mage Tower, and a other items bound by profession to move across the map quickly.How is this a point? lol?<br />
<br />
<br />
Reasons for Flying<br />
<br />
1.) I want it.<br />
2.) I have flying mounts.<br />
<br />
Yeah, try again. Nothing has been plucked apart, because it's a subjective opinion. Little twats cried for months because they couldn't trivialize content by flying, and Blizz just caved on it. <br />
<br />
Now we are getting the same treatment in Legion, but we aren't getting any fucking help to move around the map quickly because they know flying is coming.<br />
<br />
No, reasons for flying are<br />
<br />
1. It's objectively better<br />
2. You can't make an objective argument against it.<br />
3. Why would you want to spend more time doing the same exact thing? No flying is just artificial time bloat to achieve the same end goal, why someone would put that on themselves is literally unconscionable.</div></div><hr />

forced? it's been in the game since it's started, it should be the norm, this is like saying plate wearers are forced to wear plate? WELL DUH, why would you as a melee give yourself a shitty zoomed in view where you can be blinded by mechanics or the boss? no-one would thats plain stupid about as stupid as plate wearers using leather, oh wait they could/did that up until cata? shouldn't you be whining how plate is now forced to use plate? i mean that lasted less time than the camera distance did, got to use plate to stay competitive haven't you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;no lifer&quot; That's hilarious. The ignorance is staggering. I killed mythic arch last year. We raided 3 nights for 4 hours. That's 12 hours a week. A week has 168 hours in it. You think 12 out of 168 is no life? Once we killed him we went down to farm mode and only raided one night. Killing mannaroth and arch would take an hour. ONE FUCKING HOUR a week out of 168. I guarantee I raid and play this game much less than you lfr heroes. I literally log in for an hour, kill shit and log out and don't log back in till the next reset.<br />
<br />
I'll be blunt, you just lack skill. The fact that addons are hard for you to wrap your head around and you want them removed proves not only do you lack skill you lack basic intelligence. Thank fuck the game doesn't cater to you, though with all the ability pruning and dumbing down of the game I'm thinking they're heading that way.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should have read the reasoning behind the reduction before starting to insult a stranger on the internet, hu? <br />

Their reasoning stays basically the same. They shouldn't have touched it in the first place. That's just my opionion. It has worked fine for 12 years, what was there to change?<br />

Well here's an actual challenge for the devs then... instead of reducing camera distance for everyone make the wider distance more accessible.<br />
<br />
Btw. The reduced camera distance does not only affect competitive players. It also affects machinima makers - who are much more dear to me :D They often use maxed out camera distances for their work and are stupidly affected by this change...</div></div><hr />

Contrary to what they &quot;they caved in to whining!!&quot;-people are spouting, Blizzard are far more likely to change their minds based on constructive feedback.<br />

3. Why would you want to spend more time doing the same exact thing? No flying is just artificial time bloat to achieve the same end goal, why someone would put that on themselves is literally unconscionable.<br />
<br />
i cant understand you... wtf man? You are not loosing time, if you are able to fly in current content, they would do current content having in mind that you will fly, and then do quest larger (for ppl in mount) so its the Fking same, <br />
<br />
Fly there and kill 20 dragons<br />
Walk there and kill 10 dragons.<br />
<br />
1 minute saved flying, 1 minute wasted killing +10 dragons.<br />
<br />
Now, the game is designed for ground mounts, and i think its much better than flying zones like northrend. You feel more in a real enviroment than flying and skipping all the fck that you want. <br />
And nope, its not taking me more time because no flying.</div></div><hr />

You always have a choice.<br />
There is no one holding a gun to your head forcing you to download and addon, you made that choice based on a desire to raid in a guild where they expect raiders to use DBM.<br />

dont raid with a guild that sets minimum requirements that you don't agree with<br />
join a raid team that has less restrictive requirements to raid<br />
create your own raid where you set the reaid conditions<br />
choose not to raid<br />

The first time they pulled something like this off was with the rested experience. At first it was normal xp that turns into exhausted lower xp.

I dunno what sort of people there are or what eye problems they have, but why focus on the game experience, when its possible that someone out there cannot play the game with such a zoomed in camera? Blizzard just change it back to how it used to be. EVERYONE will be happy after that :P</div></div><hr />

We intended to limit the console-overridden camera zoom very early on in the Legion Beta, which would have left us with many months to iterate on gameplay and feedback that arose from the change before releasing Legion. However, due to an oversight (we capped one way of overriding it, but not another) the change did not properly go through until the very end of the development cycle. Since then, we’ve heard from many players that they’ve relied on increasing the camera zoom to counteract a number of sensitivities, ranging from motion sickness to headaches from spell effects.</div></div><hr />

I was using the further distance before they changed it cause hey why not. But it didn't bother me terribly when they reduced it, was still plenty distance imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You (Choice 1): Yes, I'm just not very good at moving and those waves just come so fast.<br />
You have been kicked from the raid.<br />
<br />
You (Choice 2): No, I didn't realize you could do that. When did they add that?<br />
You have been kicked from the raid.<br />
<br />
You (Choice 3): No, I prefer the challenge of playing close up.<br />

i know that suppose to be an example but after years of gaming with this game sadly i see that happening .</div></div><hr />

Choice 1: That's potentially an issue with the design of the encounter, players shouldn't be forced to do things beyond the default capabilities of the game in order to complete content (despite what some guilds and raid leaders think). You can't expect everyone to know about console commands. That said, if someone isn't willing to accept that players do not know everything they know and aren't willing to constructively help them... then they are the problem and not the unknowing player.<br />
<br />
Choice 2: Raid Leader is a dick, wouldn't raid with them again.<br />
<br />
Choice 3: See #2<br />
<br />
Essentially. If your raid leader doesn't let you learn the encounter with your play-style then they're doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

I've been wondering the same thing.<br />
<br />
It's always so very annoying when they just say &quot;in an upcoming hotfix&quot; but give no indication of when. And hotfixes usually happen pretty fast, but I guess not in this case.</div></div><hr />

It's live but I think you might have to hit the macro every time you log in.</div></div><hr />

Is it the same console maxfactor command or a new command ?<br />
<br />
/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 2 is the one ive tried with no success (tried different numbers aswell)</div></div><hr />
