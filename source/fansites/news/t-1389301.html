&quot;After explaining to Doomhammer the deception of Gul'dan, Durotan and Draka were sent away to safety with one of Doomhammer’s guards, but the guard betrayed them to the assassins of the Stormreaver clan. Draka was killed in the encounter.&quot; So it cannot be Draka. Also when i read book i read that she was killed. If it would be her then it wouldn't agree with lore.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, I see what they're aiming for and it's a logical thing to do, but I don't like seeing past expansions becoming ghost towns.

That's exactly what they are doing. It's about time! I really like what oQueue brought to the game, but the put so much extra 'bloatware' into the addon, that it became really annoying to use. He should have put an option in, to disable portions if you didn't want to see/use them. I am sure the Bliz version will have some issues, but it will definitely not be such a resourrce/bandwidth hog as oQueue.</div></div><hr />

It can be Draka, as they weren't killed on Draenor. They were killed in Azeroth.<br />
&quot;Before leaving Draenor, Draka and Durotan visited Geyah. Draka told her she was pregnant and Durotan added that he would be named as Go'el.&quot;<br />
Thrall was born in Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

i agree, i didnt like the addon for the same reasons, as well as i didn't like how it took over my friends list. plus the addon creator(s) and the community they tried to foster didn't sit too well with me for some reason.<br />
<br />
but the idea of the addon is good, so glad that blizzard are going to be incorporating a similar tool into the game.</div></div><hr />

No what was confusing was that I went 60 levels in cata to go to a past world from BC.<br />
Atleast the portal being in the caverns will serve to reinforce that outland is in the past.</div></div><hr />

actually if you think for a second about the timeline you would realize there is a potential for Draka to be the female orc in this, not saying that it is her just because it could be a random but; &quot;Thrall (birthname Go'el), son of Durotan (born 2 years ADP)&quot; means that she needs to be alive to give birth to him after the dark portal is opened, in warlords the dark portal has not been opened yet to my knowledge and so Draka must still be alive.<br />

Seems to be more logical to send the new one to the caverns and the one from BC to stay accessible by the Dark Portal to me, just because of the nature of these things I assume someone would find a progression taking them to the caverns to be potentially more confusing since the later Outland quests send you back to the CoT as if you would be heading there for the first time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes its best to focus on only the characters core to the story, and not try to stuff every single lore character that lived during that time. Remember the movies &quot;X-Men Last Stand,&quot; &quot;Mortal Kombat: Annhilation,&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin?&quot; So many characters squeezed into those movies just for the sake of cameos and fanboy waving, and while it wasn't the only problem with those movies, it was completely unnecessary and contributed to their crappiness.<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed there's characters I'd love to see in WoD that might have been cut, but overall I'm fine with it if it means a tighter story.</div></div><hr />

I really hope personal loot stays for flex (aka normal). I pug with oqueue and players I have never seen before; this is the best loot system to avoid any drama.</div></div><hr />

So you reach the past Outland through the present Dark Portal, but the present Outland through the Caverns of Time. But it doesn't involve time-travel? This is starting to make the MoP launch look brilliant. :p</div></div><hr />

Well, they said that we can opt into personal loot. So, maybe the raid leader toggles personal loot on or the individual toggles it on and doesn't get to roll on group loot. I too am concerned, as I flex with Oqueue. Maybe the revamp of the raid browser will get rid of our need for Oqueue (fingers crossed) in the first place.<br />

Go and read book again if you didn't read it. They were already at Azeroth. Thrall was newborn... And they were Assasinated by a guard. Already in AZEROTH. And then a human found little Thrall. If you don't know lore than don't even talk about it.</div></div><hr />

Well they did say they had plans for Asian players who do not pay a sub or buy expacs. But ya the way it's worded they plan to have it active for all regions, which ya is bad.<br />
<br />
They keep saying how much they want people to enjoy older zones through leveling, but just flat out selling characters is like saying &quot;hey we know our non new content sucks so for a base fee you can skip it all, it's not required or anything but if you want to get to the action faster or even have fun where other people are with a new account/character it is optional whether you want to do it or not&quot;. If that is the case then, then they need to stop telling people how good their old content is when they know everyone will just feel inclined to pay to skip it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could apply an analogous design philosophy with gear, like if you offered a button to click to give permanently-best-in-slot epics and legendaries for a few bucks. However, despite how most players would click on it, it wouldn't be best for overall playtime in the long term.<br />
<br />
Fewer will level 1-&gt;89 themselves including with the psychological aspect of knowing one would be investing all that time for what anyone could just buy for tens of dollars. (Gold farmers may sell accounts now but only for around an order of magnitude more cost and with a ban risk, while SoR level 80s were mainly just a small minority of players who had already played and leveled much in WoW before anyway, a lot different from newbies getting 90s enmasse).<br />
<br />
Nothing cheap feels valuable. I can understand some motives for making level 90 account characters buyable, including the desire to ease catching up with friends, but, with this real life money method, I'm not sure Blizzard learned the right lessons from Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
Sorry about focusing on the negative, but I like WoW too much to want to see the indirect consequences of this happen to it.<br />
<br />
You could ease leveling time without level 90 account buying by making non-RAF non-BOA newbies get experience bonuses more like what RAF players do now. You can even change what levels mean. For friends playing together, you could let lowbies grouped with high level players have their health, DPS, and other stats upscaled to be comparable, so they could contribute to a meaningful degree at least in casual open world content. But let them level to gain more abilities and for other reasons, to have that to look forward to over much playtime.<br />

<br />
Leveling in WoD will be a fun and fast paced romp through the zones. The team is backing off the idea that leveling should be a long grind.<br />

So do most MMORPG development teams these days ... and crash after crash has been happening (part of the widely talked about decline of the MMORPG industry) as most players in them quit too soon, feeling done with those games not long after reaching max level, after no longer having many new abilities to look forward to, after no longer looking forward to large non-instanced zones yet to enter and explore. Get past the usual near-release hype and high gaming magazine reviews from naive initial play (before those MMORPGs lose 90+% of their players a few weeks after release), and rather look at objective data in terms of third-party website traffic monitor site observations.<br />
<br />
WoW is better at player retention than others. But even WoW, if one does variants of /who searches to see only half of characters online at a time are max level, can be seen to have presently around half of total playtime spent leveling, not by hardcore raiders but by the average player.<br />
<br />
Take that away, and, unless you literally double typical playtime spent at max level before quitting (a nice goal but unlikely realistic), average future lifetime playtime per player will decrease, not good for a subscription revenue based game.<br />
<br />
Don't render level 1-89 a ghosttown. Don't make the richness of WoW's history irrelevant. I get that new developers who weren't around in the vanilla-TBC era want to make their mark, but the following is the wrong philosophy:<br />
<br />
<br />
Going forward the team will try to compartmentalize the systems added in an expansion to the expansion they were added in. A good example of this is the farm added in MoP. Once WoD is released, you shouldn't have much of a reason to go back to MoP and work on your farm.<br />
<br />
An expansion shouldn't be about trying to render irrelevant (almost like delete) all the game before the expansion. I wish I could just look forward to an expansion, in additions, not wonder how many spells will be deleted for each one added, etc. (WoW may have too much past content, too much complexity, too much depth, too many abilities for those who assume every game should be like short-playtime games, but those often aren't the players who have the attention spans to play for long and provide much long-term subscription revenue anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the sound of Draenei etc, but really underwhelmed by the lack of change.</div></div><hr />

Draka was killed in the encounter.&quot; So it cannot be Draka. Also when i read book i read that she was killed. If it would be her then it wouldn't agree with lore.<br />
<br />
That was quite some time after their arrival in Azeroth. The expansion occurs probably some years before the orcs even set foot on azeroth, before the massacre of the Draenei (that which created the &quot;path of glory&quot; in Hellfire Peninsula).</div></div><hr />
