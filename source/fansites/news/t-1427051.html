Nah we're just the type of kids who feel if we're handing over $14.99 a month that maybe, just maybe, it might be nice if Blizzard added something to their yearly festivals that have been the same now for how many years? I've lost count. I mean come on.. it's hardly a huge feat of engineering for someone sat in Anaheim to come up with a new model or two to use as a new Christmas gift. Oh wait.. they do.. and those models go straight onto the store.. and cost us more money!! yay!!<br />
<br />
I mean when was the last time Blizzard put a new festival into the game? They just re-use the same old content that's been around since Vanilla days. You have to ask yourself why that is. Why we get the same toys every Christmas.<br />
<br />
Blizzard throw us crumbs of content and re-use content year after year and expect us to be happy and appreciate how long it takes to create new exciting content. And they can do this because no other game shows them up as cruising when it comes to development. Well that might change in 2014.</div></div><hr />

So, you're complaining that your 14.99 (that funds all the raids, quests, servers, etc...) was wasted on a small apreciation token for christmas. I see...<br />
<br />
And you're complaining that the remote controled toy is just a small model from something that your character use to fly in real scale... because small RC toys in real world aren't small versions of what we do have like racing cars, military/commercial airplanes, etc... Strange huh?<br />
<br />
And also complain that christmas is still christmas after all these years or that Blizzard should flood the calendar with more, meaningless, festivals... yeah, they're surelly should change christmas 2014 to be all about fire raining from the skies, great-father hell killing random players in cities while throwing chocolates and rabbits, at the same time they port ppl to opposing cities for pvp and...<br />
<br />
Yeah... ppl are strange... and something else not worth naming on this day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you did get a new toy? And for your $14.99 a month you get access to the game, nothing more or less than that is implied or owed to you. If Blizz throw you a cool little extra toy here and there, its a bonus, its not something you're owed, so try just being thankful and having a bit of fun instead of getting all self-entitled and bitchy.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, maybe not, and you'd probably still be just as emo about the game because that's just more fun to certain people.<br />

I have absolutely no idea how you come to the conclusion that his post was &quot;emo.&quot; Was it simply that he disagrees with you on holiday content? It's not like he said he would stop playing or would cut himself because he was on a downward spiral into his only friend, depression. <br />
<br />
I also don't see how he demanded anything. At all. Most of the holiday content came about with WotLK, which is what made that x-pack so great. But nothing has changed since and anytime anyone brings it up, they get the generic response of &quot;it takes development time away from other areas.&quot; So how did they do it the 1st time?</div></div><hr />

These are kids you are dealing with. WOW is probably the only ´bill´ this person pays, so of course they think it entitles them to by king of the game and demand the devs work 100 hour weeks. Any time someone posts about what all they expect for their subscription, it is basically a sure sign they are 14-16. Most people realize we are getting hours and hours of entertainment for the prices of a movie ticket.. kids just don´t have the kinda perspective yet.</div></div><hr />

You must surely have real high expectations for whatever reason.<br />

I also don't see how he demanded anything. At all. Most of the holiday content came about with WotLK, which is what made that x-pack so great. But nothing has changed since and anytime anyone brings it up, they get the generic response of &quot;it takes development time away from other areas.&quot; So how did they do it the 1st time?<br />
<br />
You realize that practically nothing was going on during that time other than putting out new dungeons and raids? Since they didn't give us a slew of new quests every patch (in fact they only gave us that in one patch in WotLK, the Argent Tournament) they obviously had time to do something else.</div></div><hr />

In WoD, they're adding an account-wide spellbook tab for toys, like the ones for mount/pets.</div></div><hr />

It's honestly not even the things they put there for me, it's the thought it might take away time for developing things we can actually find in the game. I guess that distinction is still important for immersion with me.</div></div><hr />

Okay, so what are they doing now in comparison? New raids and scenarios, which use environments that already exist in the world so they are easier to create, and the isles, which is similar to argent tourny. They just got done telling everyone that players don't like tons of dailies to do over and over, so they shouldn't need to worry about sinking huge amounts of resources into it. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying I think they should overhaul every holiday every year, but they shouldn't have the exact same content for every holiday every year and not have pre-launch events. Add something new to one or two holidays a year. It just seems to me that the group in charge now doesn't have the same passion that was present in 2007-09.</div></div><hr />

It would have been a blessing had you refrained from logging in here as well.<br />
<br />
I need a keyring for those remotes, though, they're using a lot of space :P</div></div><hr />
