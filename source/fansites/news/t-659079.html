Players limit in Wintergrasp in 3.2<br />
There are simply too many people who are affected by the Wintergrasp lag for us to leave the issue as it stands. A change is necessary to make the Wintergrasp playable by those who truly want to participate in it. We feel that this is the best choice that we have available to us currently and that this will improve the overall quality of the experience Wintergrap players will have. <br />
<br />
[...] The issue is a complicated one, but as soon as we're able to support the number of players that are involved in Wintergrasp without debilitaiting latency, we fully intend to make the zone function as it was originally intended.

Phasing and revisiting the old world<br />
We have our own thoughts on what to do with the phasing technology and how to accommodate the ever-increasing number of MMOs making their way on to the market. Phasing is not actually instancing - you exist on the same world as other players, only obfuscated from their view, just as they are invisible to you.<br />
<br />
As for updating the &quot;Old World&quot;, we've touched on this in the past. It's simply not something we can just patch in, as it would require far too much development time to revisit this older content. It's something we may think about doing in time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/18698008855-blizzard-read-please-read-and-comment-people.html))<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds in 3.3 and at Blizzcon<br />
I will agree that we need to focus more on BGs. And to be fair we are in this very next patch, and there will be more announcements at Blizzcon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18680007792-lessons-learned-from-nerfing-ret.html))<br />
<br />
PvP balance in Battlegrounds<br />
However, to play devil's advocate, PvP balance issues manifest themselves a lot more sharply in Arena than in BGs. I don't think it's appropriate to spend 75% of our PvP time on BGs because 75% of the players are there (I made those numbers up). Things like diminishing returns on crowd control or dispel protection are just a lot less of a big deal in most BG encounters because there are more breaks in the fighting, you're fighting different people, and the strategy has more going on than just killing the other guy. I love BGs - don't get me wrong. But they tend to be more sensitive to say map issues than class issues. (Though again, because I know it will be taken out of context if I don't caveat it, class issues can definitely affect BGs.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18680007792-lessons-learned-from-nerfing-ret.html))<br />
<br />
Arena vs. Raiding<br />
It's not a very strong argument to say you don't like something and therefore we should remove or downplay it when it should be pretty clear that thousands of players do like it. Fewer players participate in Arena than raiding, but that shouldn't surprise anyone because we made a concerted effort in LK to get a lot more players into raiding, and it worked. I'm not sure it's a good idea to try and push a lot of players into Arena. We would like to get a lot more players into PvP, but I suspect many of them would have more fun in Battlegrounds. Arena isn't for everyone, and it doesn't need to be. Some players really enjoy it and we understand why. If you want to participate in these role forums however, you aren't going to be able to just dismiss PvP (or PvE) concerns just because that play style doesn't interest you.

Retribution dps in 3.2<br />
<br />
We do want to make sure Ret's PvE dps is high enough for those players without great weapons (on which the spec is perhaps too dependent). We want overall for your dps in 3.2 to be higher than in 3.1 in equivalent situations and gear. We think it will be, but we'll keep an eye on it. So far most of the posts I've seen on the subject seem overly concerned with the ramping issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18680007792-lessons-learned-from-nerfing-ret.html))<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the changes to Retribution<br />
We needed to nerf Ret pretty hard for PvP reasons. Some of you just aren't going to accept that change was needed, and I suspect it would take several long threads to convince you otherwise, so I'm not going to spend a great deal of effort in this thread trying to do so. I know it is frustrating that we have had to nerf Ret so many times this expansion. It is frustrating for us too. We keep trying to not overdo it and we keep underdoing it.<br />
<br />
We did make the changes with some longer-term changes in mind to get Ret to be less about huge upfront attacks that will hopefully give Ret players some more intersting options with regard to Seals and special attacks. We're not there yet, but we have changed paladins dramatically for LK and it's going to take some time. <br />
<br />
[...] We did make a lot of changes to the Seal and Judgement system for LK, and we're really happy with those changes overall. Like any big set of changes, they have taken a lot of iteration to complete the design. If you don't buy that, just look at the amount of change the DK class endures every patch. There are some problems we still have to solve for Ret (make sure Seal choice feels meaningful, find a niche for Crusader Strike, give low-level paladins something to do besides autoattack, etc.) but there are problems we still have to solve for all the specs in the game. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18680007792-lessons-learned-from-nerfing-ret.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing PvP and its consequences on PvE<br />
PvP balancing affects PvE balancing all the time. The opposite happens too. My comments were more about how it's pretty futile to say &quot;I don't care about PvP, so you should just make changes that affect PvE and not care about the consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
WoW is a PvP and PvE game. We're not asking you to participate equally in both. We are asking you that if you want to participate in class mechanics and balance discussion that you not just dismiss one or the other as irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I'm also not saying that if your PvE damage sucks because of a PvP change that we're okay with that.<br />
<br />
Backing up, a lot of PvP players have become really frustrated trying to handle high burst damage from a class that can turn around and remove a lot of the crowd control used to counter them and even prevent a lot of incoming damage. They're talking about you (and sometimes DKs). Unless we're willing to go in and take apart the defense mechanics (which to be fair, some players have advocated), we have to reduce the burst damage. A stacking dot is a great way to reward sustained damage at the expense of burst.<br />
<br />
However, as we have said, the goal was not to nerf Ret in PvE. Ret paladins may have been slightly behind in Ulduar, at least until they got very good weapons. We think the Seal changes will elevate Ret's sustained PvE damage over where it is on Live. If we're wrong, we have knobs to turn, such as increasing the amount of the dot or ways to apply it. We understand many players are concerned about short fights or fights where you have to retarget. To be fair, a lot of classes have the same problems. If anything, we are adding more ramp up time to more classes as a way of toning down PvP burst. The Feral druid who has to peel off of Hodir at 4 cps in order to free an NPC is going to be pretty frustrated too. Deciding when it's worth it to do so or when you're better off not changing targets is one of those skills that makes you better or worse at the game.<br />
<br />
Movement fights are a slightly different issue. We make you move in PvE because it's a challange. You're not supposed to be able to trivially overcome it.<br />
<br />
It's also not fair to characterize all of the Ret changes as for PvP only. As one example, we have struggled with the damage recoil on Seal of Blood for some time. Players didn't seem to particularly like it. It felt like a liability in PvE and it didn't add a balance offset to the abilitiy in PvP. So we removed the mechanic.

Yes discouraging people from playing wintergrasp is an awesome solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think it's appropriate to spend 75% of our PvP time on BGs because 75% of the players are there.<br />
Do you think bgs should be ignored and the game should be balanced around the minority who play other forms of pvp ?<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP balance in Battlegrounds<br />
There is no balance in pvp bgs because you balance pvp completely around arena. Pala, dks &amp; healer dominate bgs, everything else is free kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not a very strong argument to say you don't like arena and therefore we should remove or downplay it when it should be pretty clear that thousands of players do like it. Fewer players participate in Arena than raiding.<br />
<br />
Balancing all forms of pvp around the arena minority kills battelgrounds and screws over pve. Pvp should focus more on bgs &amp; world pvp.</div></div><hr />

AV the way it was was epic, grand, huge and time consuming.<br />
A lot complained about it, but it was the most FUN battleground to actually play.<br />
<br />
Then it got nerfed... And was just a grind since. &gt;_&lt; it sucked.<br />
They need to add a battleground that emulates the old AV, without the &quot; av marks &quot; so it doesn't get nerfed into a 10-20 minute sprint to the other side.</div></div><hr />

The Feral druid who has to peel off of Hodir at 4 cps in order to free an NPC is going to be pretty frustrated too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, because it's so frustrating for a Feral to be doing his normal DPS, pop Rip/Savage Roar/FB like he was going to anyway at 4 CPs, move onto another target, then move back to Hodir and get his 4 CPs back within three GCDs. It's every bit as frustrating as a Retribution Paladin losing 25% DPS for 12 seconds while he builds up 4 stacks, having to switch targets and being nerfed for the first 15 seconds there too, then switching back and having to spend another 15 seconds at 75% output.<br />
<br />
Let me simplify that, so you can see how bad it is. Druids ramp up in 3-4 GCDs and are not nerfed while they do so. Paladins ramp up in 10-12 GCDs and are nerfed 25% while they do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deciding when it's worth it to do so or when you're better off not changing targets is one of those skills that makes you better or worse at the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Freya triplets, Hodir's Flash Freeze, Yogg-Saron P1 and P2, Mimiron P3, Thorim P1, Razorscale air phases and XT-002 all require constant target switching. I'd love to hear the rationale for making Retribution Paladins completely non-viable in Ulduar.<br />

<br />
making paladins use 20seconds before they're able to do Some dmg at all, they will either already be dead as for pvp, cause no other class use more than 20sec to kill anyone, warlocks kills faster than your GCD is over.. <br />
and for pve its just gonna fuck up again, and with the bullshit about other classes having the same problem with dmg, shuv it up your ass and die clueless faggot. <br />

<br />
What the blues aren't saying is that most of the outright naked seething hate on the forums is because the new longer lead-in (we didn't mind a slight ramp time)<br />
<br />
What is of extreme concern in PVE is how long the ramp time is (optimally 5x weapon speed, however this is assuming 100% time on target, and doesn't count for target switching), especially compared to other melee, many whom don't have a ramp time or have a very short ramp time (shamans, dk's), can carry over elements to the next target (rogue SnD, rage and runic power); the problem is that we don't raid patchwork test bots or target dummies, but bosses, where target switching is important (XT heart phase, Auriaya feral defenders, hodir's ice blocked people, the entire arena in thorim, all of yogg, razorscale trash and her initial landing cycles, the various add phases on freya except maybe the big tree dude, in other words, all 3.1 non-vehicle bosses except ignus and vezax, which are much like patchwork for ret pallies, especially because we cant interrupt the latter)</div></div><hr />

Day one of patch 3.0 called. They'd like to remind you that we're now in patch 3.1 and that 2 shots were hot-fixed the first day.<br />
<br />
Show me one APPROPRIATELY geared person who gets 2-shot in a single Hammer. It doesn't happen. <br />
<br />
Let's not forget that resilience will now be affecting ALL damage from players.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that NO dps class would find it acceptable that they had to perform at 25% below their potential until 17 seconds had passed. We simply will be doing subpar DPS until we get 5 melee swings connected. That's all there is to it. It's a terrible mechanic. The problem is they can't seem to figure out how to give Seal of Crap a pvp utility to MAKE people want to use it.<br />
<br />
But if you find the ramp up acceptable then rogues should only get combo points on melee strikes. Same for druids. Only after 5 of course. Let's make sure warlocks on get the affect of a DoT after they've wanded 5 times. He said they wanted to expand the ramp up times to cut burst.</div></div><hr />

In this dramastic fight between Ret's community and Blizzard Chieftan Gc takes first place!! Congratulations!!!<br />
<br />
GC fights a meaningless battle, talking about everything like PvP and arena in general (in a thread about Retribution PvE, nonetheless), but not really addressing the PvE issues Rets will have with the change in its current form. But in the end, he won't be able to dodge the issue. Why?<br />
<br />
That's why. (http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php?serverid=-1&amp;factionid=-1&amp;minlevel=80&amp;maxlevel=80&amp;servertypeid=-1)<br />
<br />
While it's not official data, it should a good idea about general class representation. Funny how the classes that get the most complainments are also the most popular classes. <br />
<br />
IIRC, Paladins were second to last (before Shamans) during BC in this reprentation. That should give you a rough idea how many players (and with that, so many horrible players that are the cause of all the QQ) started to play Paladins when Retribution became viable. <br />
<br />
Ruining a class that popular would be a very, very bad move for Blizzard right now, considering Aion is coming around soon (which could or could not be a competitor, although I doubt that) and a dwindling player base. If Wow still grew normal, why wouldn't they top the 11,5 million players? Remember, 11,5 million is a number they announced in December 2008 and they roughly got 1 million players every 6 months in the past few years. <br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying that Wow is dying yet, but seeing so many long-time players quit due the course WotLK has taken and massive ad campaigns for WoW in the last few weeks, things could certainly look better.</div></div><hr />

GC like other ppl have it's own opinion. It's really bad, it have an influence on the game balance.<br />
I guess PvP part of the game have major priority for him. I think Ret's in Pve is very important, like any other class, and this nerf will be completely Head-off change for them</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. GC is talking based on his OPINION. The entire game is balanced based on his opinion - NOT on real stats. He feels this and that and thats it. So RET will be overnerfed - just like Holy palas are now playing the most limited spec in the game. Or we rather should say... the spec that is not beeing played at all.<br />
<br />
2. The game is balanced based on PVP Arena. But like GC said himself not everyone likes to play Arena. Thats fine but then why on EARTH is the entire game - balanced around it? Its not like PVP is balanced for BGs ? Its not like its balanced for world scirmishes. NO... It is balanced for something that ALOT of ppl hate. And they hate Arena because the entire game is BALANCED on it. And they dont like it. <br />
<br />
But that takes us back to 1. Thats what BLizzard wants. They want the game to be balanced on Arena. So be it... It doesnt make it right.. they are only forcing the issue - and alot of ppl dont like to be forced into opinions.<br />
<br />
Overall - I think the healing forums on the official website kinda says it all about what is going on at Blizzard right now. The only blue post on the forum is about why there are no blues answering on the real issues of the specs. It has a quite long list of blue replies.... <br />
<br />
Here is the thing.... Blizzard is building a game based on opinions of ppl like GC who likes this and hates that. And the entire game is balanced on it. So ret - if you are overnerfed - then its because GC wants it so.. If holy palas have no longer a role because they were supposed to be single target healers only then it will be soe.... Get over it -stop spending money on things you dont like and just say to GC what he really deserves to hear.<br />

<br />
Something that is also shown in his latest blue post regarding the question about stacking the SoV DoT with a fast 1-hander:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm curious to know how you feel about Ret Paladins using fast one-handers to stack the DoTs faster, then switching to a two-hander.<br />
I have seen the speculation. We discussed it a bit and think it's unlikely that would really pan out as a dps increase given how much damage you'd lose from the two-hander. If you're in a situation where you manage to acquire a really great one-hander and two-hander then it will be interesting to see if you can make it work. It's not the intent though. <br />
I emphasized the bolded parts. This issue isn't something to think about, discuss about or &quot;wait and see&quot; - they have numbers and can do the math to prove the theory right or wrong. Not doing so is horrible, sloppy work.<br />
<br />
Exemplar on EJ did the math and proved that the dps gain is so small under optimal conditions that it's a guaranteed DPS loss with human reaction time and ping.<br />
<br />
No thinking. No discussion. No interesting, suprising sights. Just math. That's the way such issues should be handled.</div></div><hr />

No, because having to recast a DoT you cast a few seconds ago is not good, or trying to cast a DoT that have a CD.<br />
Also, it's not 17 seconds. Assuming a 3.5s Weapon speed it's a maximum of 14 seconds, since you WILL have speed increasing effects, not counting haste on gear. Though, they should make some other ability stack the seal dot anyway.</div></div><hr />

1. on the PvE vs PvP: Why bother Pve you run around raiding to get the best gear you can and by next patch your gear is outdated again. not to mention that the new change for the conquest emblems is just a spit in the face to anyone who raided and worked 4 gear. on the PvP side no matter how much you QQ for balance it wont get here cause they arent working on it at all, seriously EVERY season comes with the brand NEW cookie cutter free rating set up .that never gets fixed til the end of the season and another class just replaces it.Its just blizzards way of giving a class the 5min of spot light you just need 2 wait your turn or get all classes to 80 and play the 1 they choose that season.<br />
<br />
2.Even the nerfs are intended as a money sink. Class A gets nerfd the 2 hell and back<br />
you can (a)complain and keep playing (b)reroll a new class (hehe more money 4 blizz since u just restarted a guarateed 3months track) (c) complain and actually quit(you wont cause guildy will tell you it aint so bad and blizz will fix it)<br />

This is not true. &quot;maximum of 14 seconds&quot; would mean you having a weapon with 2.8 speed counting in haste which I can't see being possible.<br />
<br />
Doing the math with gear I have at the moment I get around 16.5 seconds down time (3.6 speed weapon, 6.42% haste, 3% speed increase from aura).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think the difference in calculations depends on whether or not you are assuming you melee right away or not. The time between first melee and 5th melee for a 3.6 speed weapon with no haste is 14.4 seconds. You only have 4 swing timers. I've never really paid attention, but when you run in to melee, do you start swinging automatically or does the swing timer not start until you are in melee range?<br />
<br />
Not trying to naysay you, just trying to explain the difference between his 14 seconds and your 16.5.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

We want overall for your dps in 3.2 to be higher than in 3.1 in equivalent situations and gear. We think it will be, but we'll keep an eye on it. So far most of the posts I've seen on the subject seem overly concerned with the ramping issue.<br />
<br />
I like how everyone is conveniently ignoring this part in favor of there own math. Just because they added a ramp up time doesn't mean they didn't buff other things accordingly.<br />
<br />
Because, you know, EJ has never been wrong before, right?<br />
<br />
I'd also like to offer a probable solution for you paladins to petition before Blizz, why not have the dot that is applied last up to ~30 seconds so target switching isn't too detrimental in most cases. This keeps the ramp-up time, but only for the beginning of the fight. Just an idea.<br />
<br />
Edit: as a reference, they did supposedly buff the seals:<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Seal of Vengeance and Seal of Corruption: These seals have been redesigned to deal substantially more damage. Now, once a paladin has 5 copies of the debuff from these seals on his or her target, on each swing the paladin will deal 33% weapon damage as Holy, with critical strikes dealing double damage. In addition, the damage-over-time effect is now considered a melee attack instead of a spell attack and the effects from these seals can only be triggered by auto-attacks and Hammer of the Righteous.<br />
<br />
My point here is not to start an argument, but to point out that this change might not be as bad as you think. And in the case that it is, provide a probable solution, to what appears to be the most controversial element of the change, for discussion.</div></div><hr />

Evidently you fail at reading the notes. The seal does NO DAMAGE WHATSOEVER until 5 stacks are up. NONE. It's the same as a melee swing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand the way the seal works, just because you have to stack the debuff five times first to get the effect doesn't mean that it will be worse. If they buffed the damage after the five stack had been applied enough it could potentially make up for it. That is all I was trying to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ahh okay. Well the rampup problem is the real problem right now. 15 seconds to reach base potential is insane for any class. Yes, once the stack is up, all your specials and melee attacks will benefit but again, it takes 12-15 seconds to get there. I'm going to paste something I said on the OF:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- To get our DoT up we have to hit with auto-attacks 5 times. There is no other way to apply it. Depending on haste and weapon speed that works out to about 12-15 seconds. Engineers + speed potion should be able to get it down to 9 seconds but that means giving up the top dps glove enchant to do so.<br />
- Up until that point, our melee swings do nothing but normal damage. We might as well not even HAVE a seal on it.<br />
- In the interim, we have three attacks - Crusader Strike (75%) weapon damage - 4 second cooldown, Divine Storm 110% weapon damage - 10 second cooldown and consecration (damage based on SP and AP) 10 second cooldown. If we get lucky and have an Art of War proc (that can only proc from melee crits), you could throw exorcism in there. But you have to be in melee range to GET an AoW proc.<br />
<br />
Now, once the 5 stack is up damage is good but again, look at the ramp-up time. It's even LONGER considering we have to get next to the target to actually get the stack going. <br />
<br />
<br />
Everything depends on us getting into melee range and actually connecting with auto-attacks.</div></div><hr />

Edit: The post I'm replying to here was evidently deleted, and unfortunately I didn't quote it. The main points for why the longer DoT was a bad idea were that it keeps people from stealth-ing in PvP and would do a large amount of damage.<br />

There are only two valid solutions in my mind. Make the DoT not stack on players OR allow the DoT to grant a percentage of the damage of the full DoT while it's ramping up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't like the first solution, but I agree with the second. It should provide 20% of the benefit it does now for each application of the DoT. (So with a 5 stack it's 100%, or the exact same as it is now.) This is initially how I thought (assumed) it worked anyway and can't see a reason they're not doing this, unless they really think people need a 5 swing lead in PvP. <br />
<br />
For reference, I play a mage and if a pally hits me 5 times within the time the dot lasts I'm doing something wrong. And before you say it, no I do not currently have any problems killing paladins in PvP which is why I'm here trying to understand the change, which I believe will be a PvE DPS increase if Blizzard is true to their word. (Have a little faith, and yes I realize I just said that.)</div></div><hr />

Wow...seriously? You're reading that as &quot;we removed the DoT completely, here's how it's going to work now&quot;? I'm reading it as being in addition to the dot because they don't mention removing that component from Vengeance/Corruption.<br />
<br />
Also, I can see seal-twisting becoming a new technique where you stack the DoT to 5 for the extra damage on each swing and then switching to Seal of Command for a few attacks based on your weapon speed. Unless you need Vengeance up to proc the 33% weapon damage effect.<br />
<br />
Besides that you're completely ignoring what kind of damage you'll be able to do once you *do* get the DoT ramped up to a full stack. Especially with the new T9 weapons. I don't think I've ever seen someone get kicked from a raid because his DPS was low on trash or for the first 14-17 seconds of a boss fight. They usually get kicked for piss-poor DPS at the *end*.<br />
<br />
Now, for PvP, maybe you should be looking at Command instead? Unless you're partnered with a kiter against non-dispel teams.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. What you're reading is wrong. The seal does no damage whatsoever like it does now. Right now, seals add damage on top of the melee swing. Additionally seal damage is applied on all melee attacks (divine storm, crusader strike, autoattack). The new version will have a DoT (which does very minimal damage mind you) which was preexisting however seal damage (the damage on top of the melee attack) is no longer there. Additionally, no additional damage is being done but ANY attacks (base damage only) until the 5 stack is up.<br />
<br />
But ignoring that to answer your other questions, Seal twisting is only viable if you're pretty much a robot and even then it's a net loss in DPS. Same goes for equipping a fast 1-hand weapon. No one is concerned about trash dps honestly. It's just a way to pad the numbers. <br />
<br />
As far as command, it's hitting for LESS than SoR glyphed right now. This goes back to the heart of the problem. Instead of making SoComm (the supposed PvP seal) worth actually USING they nerf'd the PvE seal because people were using it instead.</div></div><hr />

It makes perfect financial sense: They can spend a hell of a lot of development time (aka MONEY) creating content that people will blow through in a month or so and not return to at the release of the next xpac (PVE), OR you can make a small amount of content that people will play over and over again throughout the lifecycle of the game (PVP). * *<br />
<br />
Its pretty clear PVP now reigns supreme in regard to the balance system, and money is why. *PVP needs to be balanced in order to shift focus away from PVE and onto PVP where they will be able to keep our $15 a month and have to do less work therefore making more profit. *Corporate model FTL or FTW depending on your side of the fence. * <br />
<br />
Ultimately, at a high level of management, im sure this has been all been considered. In the end it will reduce the overall number of subscriptions they receive, however profits will increase because a huge amount expenditure in development will be reduced. *Actizzard is just slowly transitioning us to a bigger profit model, or at least one they can better predict revenue gains. *Lost subscriptions dont matter because that percentage of gamers that would leave were statistically likely to leave to play another game anyhow. *Im sure its considered an acceptable loss. <br />
<br />
Why, if it is still highly profitable, can they not continue to make content and the majority of balance based on PVE even if the bottom line is not as great as it could be? Its still alot of black ink and I would think that catering to the community that got them to this point would be Priority #1.* Just seems like PVP is what the majority of decisions are about now.<br />
<br />
However it seems the allmighty dollar wins again.* Personally, i think its both disgusting and sad... as i go to pay my $15. *</div></div><hr />

We want overall for your dps in 3.2 to be higher than in 3.1 in equivalent situations and gear. We think it will be, but we'll keep an eye on it. So far most of the posts I've seen on the subject seem overly concerned with the ramping issue.<br />
<br />
I like how everyone is conveniently ignoring this part in favor of there own math. Just because they added a ramp up time doesn't mean they didn't buff other things accordingly.<br />
<br />
Because, you know, EJ has never been wrong before, right?<br />
<br />
Empty promises don't make things magically real. Math have proven them wrong far more often than their thoughts the math. I said it in my post above and I'm saying it again:<br />
<br />
Just thinking is the wrong way to go in such situations. Maths can be done to determine how the whole things plays out. They have (or at least should have) the people to so, and ignoring this aspect is sloppy work.</div></div><hr />

Looks like about 50% of the top 3v3 teams have paladins, and ret is more common than holy.<br />
<br />
in 5v5, paladins have 118% representation (that means some teams have two paladins) and again, ret is more common than holy.<br />
<br />
In 2v2, where paladins are most balanced, they are still over represented, even though holy makes up slightly more than half of those numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the reprentation of the ret paladins based on burst dmg or something else ? Maybe ret paladins shouldn't have a bubble if the problem is that they are able to get out of CC of some classes ? <br />
<br />
<br />
The point many rets are making is that these changes have nothing to do with the problems. If a ret pala is able to burst a bubble to get that extra 10% to kill someone instead of use it aas a defencive move like it was originally intented... then what should be done ? <br />
<br />
Blizzard is not making the right desissions - thats what alot of ppl are saying and the might of BLizzard is not ready to back down and really talk things through... THey make up their mind before and then they force their opinion on to others. GC said it himself earlier today - he was more happy with having a group of ppl playing &quot;their&quot; beta- WOLK cause Blizzard was able to pick who was allowed to post on forums...</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't the best thing be to separate them.<br />
<br />
Add a tab to the current talents (under the secondary spec) which is pvp-talents only. <br />
it could be free of charge just to ease the situation<br />
It could be one tree for each niche (melee, healer etc.) Add pvp-talents in these trees and remove them from the pve trees.<br />
In the normal world (in game) you can choose between having your pve-talents or pvp-talents (maybe if you want to world pvp for an example).<br />
As soon as you enter a bg or arena, you'd automatically switch to your pvp-tree. <br />
If you enter a raid instance you'd automatically switch to your pve-spec. <br />
<br />
It would probably be a pain in the ass to implent but it would mean pve and pvp would be somewhat separated, and it should be much easier to balance.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but no. Group PVP doesn't get &quot;balanced&quot; in ANY game. It's ALWAYS a zerg fest, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.<br />

I don't even have to try in BGs and I double the next persons damage, triple their killing blows. And I'm honor capped, so I'm not HK farming, I'm trying to accomplish the objective of the BG the entire time.<br />

Reasons behind the changes to Retribution<br />
We needed to nerf Ret pretty hard for PvP reasons. Some of you just aren't going to accept that change was needed, and I suspect it would take several long threads to convince you otherwise, so I'm not going to spend a great deal of effort in this thread trying to do so. I know it is frustrating that we have had to nerf Ret so many times this expansion. It is frustrating for us too. We keep trying to not overdo it and we keep underdoing it.<br />
<br />
We did make the changes with some longer-term changes in mind to get Ret to be less about huge upfront attacks that will hopefully give Ret players some more intersting options with regard to Seals and special attacks. We're not there yet, but we have changed paladins dramatically for LK and it's going to take some time. <br />
<br />
[...] We did make a lot of changes to the Seal and Judgement system for LK, and we're really happy with those changes overall. Like any big set of changes, they have taken a lot of iteration to complete the design. If you don't buy that, just look at the amount of change the DK class endures every patch. There are some problems we still have to solve for Ret (make sure Seal choice feels meaningful, find a niche for Crusader Strike, give low-level paladins something to do besides autoattack, etc.) but there are problems we still have to solve for all the specs in the game.

Hmm Im a bit lazy but I still went a clicked 2v2: My own maths:<br />
<br />
out of the 30 first teams, 10 have paladins and out of those 10 teams only two of them are ret.<br />
I don't know how you made your calculations but...<br />
<br />
Edit : Acutally out of the 66 first 3v3 teams, 17 of them have paladins and only FOUR of them are ret...<br />
<br />
17 / 66 Doesn't sound over represented to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must agree that pallies are over represented:<br />
<br />
10 team with pallies in the first 24 teams<br />
<br />
But still only THREE of those teams are ret pally.<br />
<br />
And the fact that a class is over represented doesn'T justify a complete nerf to the ground to one class... Notice how I said CLASS not SPEC.<br />
<br />
If ret was 50% it would be called for.</div></div><hr />

Balancing pvp and pve is impossible w/o separating the 2. Use a totally separate set of trees and BAM you free up a shit load of room to balance W/O affecting either pvp or pve. It's the simplest of simple solutions. <br />
But here's something I don't understand. You say well if ret pve dps isn't what it should be you will crank it up. What about &quot;all that internal&quot; testing you do ???? Shouldn't you KNOW what ret dps will be before and after you nerf em ? Same goes for every other class. Take hunters for instance also. Do you have some other source of information that says hunter's have NOT been last in almost every season save for the few weeks in 5 when the bwx2 came into play ? Which in the end made them 5th overall.<br />
You people contradict yourselves all the time.</div></div><hr />
