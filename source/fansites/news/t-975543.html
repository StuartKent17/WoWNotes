<br />
We’re looking for feedback on your class as we work on changes and adjustments for a future game update. While we may be making some specific class changes in 4.3, what we’re looking for in this thread is overall feeling on the class as a whole for more long term changes in the future.<br />
<br />
Here is the kind of feedback that is NOT helpful in this particular thread:<br />
<br />
<br />
Concerns that your current damage, healing or tanking is not competitive. While this kind of feedback is often useful, it also is the kind of thing that can change from patch to patch, and so it isn’t as useful for long term vision changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Concerns that your feedback is being ignored or that we don’t take these kind of posts seriously, or otherwise posting anything that is off-topic or not in the spirit of this thread’s intent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Requests for responses to your suggestions or feedback. The purpose of this thread is to get information to us, not the reverse.<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope you take these threads seriously, as we’re going to be reading them very carefully. We ask that you take time to think and formulate a useful and objective reply, as this feedback could be used to alter your class in substantial ways.<br />
<br />
We won’t be replying here addressing your concerns. This is purely for us to read your answers to the below questions.<br />
<br />
Please copy the below questions into your reply and answer each one.<br />
<br />
<br />
What type of content do you focus on? [PvE/PvP/Both]<br />
If PvE, what type of PvE? [Heroics/Raids/Other]<br />
If PvP, what type of PvP? [Arenas, BGs, Rated BGs]<br />
What are your biggest quality-of-life issues? For instance, no longer requiring ammo could be considered a quality-of-life improvement for hunters.<br />
What makes playing your class more fun?<br />
What makes playing your class less fun?<br />
How do you feel about your “rotation”? (Rotation is the accepted order in which abilities are used to maximum efficiency.)<br />
What’s on your wish list for your class?<br />
What spells do you use the least?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quras</div><div class="date">2011-09-12, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess there is nothing wrong with pretending that player feedback is important as blizzard has said many many times that the game is not designed around what players want. <br />
<br />
<br />
It might sooth a few thousand players who believe something they mentioned on a blizzard site actually might get used. However, on the company side, nothing like having many thousands of people brainstorm new ideas and fixes and list them for free on a companies website so they can rake in millions off of you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Truthfully, I'm shocked people do it but maybe it makes them feel better about the current situation on the game. blizzard will design the game as they see fit and always have. Our opinions mean very little in the overall scoop of the game. It's not something I can really support, so I'll have to pass on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No one is saying that WOW isn't number 1.<br />
<br />
However, WOW has currently lost more subs that most MMO's ever have. Now they are asking for feedback to which long term players know will never actually get used. Proof of that is from making posts on class forums and class threads as well as being in beta's and on the PTR. Players list and list their ideas and fixes (many of them very good and all FREE brain storming on blizzard behalf) and yet most of the time blizzard changes nothing.<br />
<br />
It it neither worth the time or effort to list anything to blizzard as you will not very likely see anything happen. Same as the last time blizzard did this and the time before that and the time before that.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is trying to improve Wow with user feedback. Understand what fans are looking for, and improve our gaming experiance. Theyre pushing themselves as predicted. As competition gets tougher, change becomes more important. Kudos to you blizz! I look forward to future changes! :)</div></div><hr />

Since Star Wars: The Old Republic is coming out, we're all pretty much scared shitless over here at Blizzard Headquarters because we know our subscription numbers will hit all time lows rivaling that of this already lackluster shitstorm that we have come to know and love: Cataclysm. So, in a last ditch attempt to make it seem like we listen to our community, we're going to put out these 'Class Feedback' threads even though we already know most the issues with the various class specs but just can't be f*&amp;$ed to fix it.<br />

Problem is it's a little too late. To much &quot;don't&quot; and not enough &quot;do&quot;.<br />
<br />
Problems and complaints have been listed on PTR's, class forums and pretty much any fan website. If they had been doing their job with and weeding through their own forums as well as a little scouting other forums they would not be where they are now. Asking for help.<br />
<br />
To which I say most long term WOW players already know is a waste of time. It's been a waste of time for 6 years. It will be a waste of time now.<br />

<br />
We told them that leveling was way too fast, that there was relatively little to do at max level. We told them that Holy Power lacked depth and was not a very well-thought system. We told them that the new healing and tanking systems felt too homogenized. We warned them of epic queue times, as even on the freaking beta PTR, queues went from instant to &gt; 45 minutes in less than one month. Every single problem and criticism Cata has faced, they knew about 5-6 months before the game launched. Not a single one took them by surprise.<br />
<br />
They CHOSE not to do anything about them. Ghostcrawler even complained that testers weren't being as &quot;helpful&quot; as in years past because we were flooding the beta forums with complaints. Instead of realizing that we were giving negative feedback because Cata was shaping up to be ten flavors of terrible, they accused beta testers of being unhelpful.<br />
<br />
NOW they want feedback? Right, all they want is a way to get players excited for the game at Blizzcon by looking at the list of player concerns where, say, the #1 concern for Paladins is that &quot;Holy power lacks depth and just isn't fun,&quot; and then tell folks at Blizzcon, &quot;We're planning on giving Holy Power more depth and making it more fun.&quot; The crowd goes wild, hearing exactly what they want to, never mind that there were absolutely no specifics given and that this sort of thing usually only translates into something like a new graphic in-game. It's a clever marketing ploy.</div></div><hr />

I love how there are so many sites out there that have great information about classes and many times (probably most of the time) it's posted to blizzards already existing class forums and it's rarely if ever used.<br />

No, those &quot;gamers&quot; bring it on themselves. Most people have fun with their products, since, you know, these are games made for entertainment. Not everyone over-analyzes every little pixel, or reads too much into the blue posts.

No, blizzard brought it own themselves. The consistent request for advice over the years from it's gamers in PTR's, beta's and class forums and the subsequent &quot;Non-use&quot; of that advice and I'm not saying all the advice was good either. However, there have been a great many threads that have had excellent ideas to blizzards problems when it comes to what gamers would like to see. It is blizzard job at that point to weed through the good and the bad and as a gamer we hope they do something about the problem at hand. It was rarely ever fixed.<br />
<br />
Beta problems never looked at, posters were then told they were the problem and being to negative. Others know this to be true of the Beta and PTR posts.<br />
<br />
If blizzard wants players to analyze their game they cannot in turn (as you say) also tell gamers to not over-analyze the same game. That would be a stupid request.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has created jaded gamers and thats why they have currently lost more subs than pretty much any other MMO has ever had. Cause players are unhappy and jaded.<br />
<br />
You are right on one aspect. WOW is currently not for me but that is not what this thread is about. It's about the class feedback to which I think will be a complete waste of time.<br />
<br />
As I have said earlier. Blizzard has pounded it's players over the years and said, They do not design the game around what players want. Asking for advice now is just a waste of time and players efforts through blizzard own admission from the statement above.<br />
<br />
There not going to design the game around what players want anyway. So, there is no point in posting.</div></div><hr />

I'm ready for a new game. I had a lot of fun in wow over the years, but it needed to just die at the end of WOTLK. Now it's demise is long overdue. Bringing on unqualified people like ghostcrawler to manage probably one of the most important aspects of the game was probably some beureaucratic nonsense, because let's face it, he isn't qualified to do his job.

Blizzcon is just more smoke and mirrors as someone said earlier, and I laughed when I saw the &quot;free pet&quot; they are trying to use as a carrot to get more people to give them $40. I'm ready for a new game. I had a lot of fun in wow over the years, but it needed to just die at the end of WOTLK. Now it's demise is long overdue. Bringing on unqualified people like ghostcrawler to manage probably one of the most important aspects of the game was probably some beureaucratic nonsense, because let's face it, he isn't qualified to do his job. Past MMOs knew when to call it.. WoW just can't kill the greed machine.<br />
<br />
Mostly this. While I think the next expansion will determine a lot. I mean every company makes mistakes and Cata could have been Blizzards. I think the game was great and very enjoyable (and mostly still is) but Cata brought forth too many downfalls and wrong ideas. They have a chance to turn it around with the next patch and the next Exp Pack but if they dont they are probably dunzo. That and how much of a hit they will take from SWTOR.</div></div><hr />

Even if one stupid person posts a troll comment they instantly shut the thread down. I wonder how long until they shut these down cause they are tired of seeing &quot;this fails or that sucks&quot;. They only want to hear good or positive feedback. Blizzard in my opinion (and for the most part, not always) does not take constructive criticism well. They think the game is flawless and anybody who complains is a troll, when it couldnt be farther from the truth.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />

<br />
So your argument doesn't really stick.<br />
<br />
Yes they did and they threw away most of the feedback; I have no doubt it was read and sent around, but instead of acting on that stuff, Blizzard chose to do nothing and just have GC make extensive posts that most of the feedback was fun, but unrealistic and impossible to implement quickly and cheaply.<br />
<br />
Hence why it was deemed a PR stunt by many: make a big deal out of asking players their class feedback, let it simmer for a few weeks, take a month off for &quot;analysis&quot; and then come back with close to nothing but some air, some dust and some vague promises that won't cost you anything to forget.</div></div><hr />

I'd say instead of deleting said thread and/or locking it. Blizzard should use some of that &quot;Getting through the static&quot; they consistently talk about and pull out of said post what they need in the first place.<br />
<br />
You get 200 posts that say &quot;shamans SUCK at &quot;______!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd suggest reading the part that says what shaman suck at and not so much reading of grammar or how it was posted. If they wanted to find the meat of a complaint they could but most times they choose not to. There is constructive criticism in the statement above, sadly blizzard chooses to ignore it in most cases.</div></div><hr />

So, in a last ditch attempt to make it seem like we listen to our community, we're going to put out these 'Class Feedback' threads even though we already know most the issues with the various class specs but just can't be f*&amp;$ed to fix it.<br />

One can only take so much negativity before a lurker registers an account. The Blizzard bashing and hate is really getting old guys. Blizzard is an *amazing* company that goes to great lengths to try to make fun games for all of us. You guys are so spoiled you cannot even see this anymore. Regardless of how bored you have become World of Warcraft is a huge success and changed the landscape of (MMO) gaming forever. Even against all this hate and seemingly never being able to make the right decision, they still try. They still come back to us. They still invite us to care - to give a damn. To have fun.<br />
<br />
By all means go play any other game, Just don't forget how much fun you had playing WoW. I don't see how becoming bored with a game after 6-7 years (!) is an excuse to shit on all the effort being done. That's just not cool. We don't need that sort of community.</div></div><hr />

Origin/EA did it with Ultima. They suddenly started at least acting like they cared about community feedback once enough people stepped away. The &quot;working as intended&quot; responses ceased.

<br />
The problem isn't that Blizzard doesn't ask for feedback. It does. And A LOT. But what they don't do is act on the feedback. Literally ever. The amount of bugs and imbalances that have made it through every PTR and beta ever stand as a testament to that. They say that the amount of testers is too few on PTR and beta but honestly it should take only a single person to find and report a bug to have it fix let alone having thousands of players report a single bug on beta and not have it fixed until 4 months into an expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me personally SW:TOR doesn't have to be a big change. WoW is a very sound game from a technical point of view. All I want is something new. And thát is what SW:TOR will provide. Not a radical change of the genre, but just a new and fresh game. And I'll drop it all the same once it gets old again. I might even try out Guild Wars 2.</div></div><hr />

Not so much the Paladin population as a whole, mostly the players who play the Ret spec.

Listen children if you present them with an idea (in a mature manner) and they like it they might try it out. It might bomb, and it might succeed and if it does it will probably be tweaked to the way they like it. Regardless don't expect a email/PM for your failed/successful idea.

Yeah, because the developing team WANTED to fly while playing. Face it. We only get what we want when we say it for so long and so loud that it pierces through thick skulls, and start to feel like their own ideas. I still amazed that transmogrification pierced through.<br />
And EVEN if the developers feel like following the community desires, REALLY, you think the official Blizzard marketing tool is their source? Better chance of them consulting fan sites for more reliable feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might be right, if someone has already pointed out that they did this in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
I mean lets be honest here, people could have the most AWSOME idea for a class that you and other people who play that class love, but in the end it might be too complicated or will effect too many things in the game. How will it effect PVP balance and will a majority (not the 2000-3000 players who go on the forums here or the official forums) actually understand how the idea will work? People have to understand that while a few can post the same compliant, it might not even be fixable at the moment like the long queue times. However why post feedback at all? Post feedback you think makes sense and isn't overly complicated and you think doesn't effect balance. Not my idea, but here is a example of feedback I think would be great for hunters that wouldn't take alot of time for Blizzard to do and doesn't effect PVP balance. <br />
<br />
If a hunter's pet is not in range of a target, the hunter himself will get a small enrage that is make him do dmg equal to when his pet and him are attack together and the enrage wears off once the pet starts attacking. To activate this enrage the pet must be on its a way to attacking a target.<br />
<br />
This to me looks like a good idea since hunters are hurt by target switching and for BMs this is a great idea since they have to rely on kill command. Like I said this is someone else's idea and there could be a flaw or 2 in there that could be fixed to make the idea work, but the thing is feedback isn't overly complicated, something that Blizzard can do rather quickly and it doesn't appear to hurt PVP balance.</div></div><hr />

You are the very definition of the fanboy he mentioned in his post. Very obvious.<br />
<br />
...and if with every expansion came 100% new art/models/skins, people would just move on down the list to their next thing to complain about. http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/727247-Cataclysm-Preview-Grim-Batol?p=8141823#post8141823<br />
One of your first posts, defending blizz for having mostly recycled assets.<br />
<br />
As well, you misinterpreted what he said. The core of the game is dead, and while the term is somewhat figurative, the underlying meaning is pretty solid. If this was a healthy game, at worst the attitude of the community would be a 50/50 split between &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;unhappy&quot;.

<br />
Obviously high school is not yet in your accomplishments.<br />
<br />
When the trend is going DOWN - that's a bad thing. When a million people (or as Blizzard refers to them: $15 million dollars in monthly revenue) suddenly vanishes, that remaining number isn't as important as trying to stop the bleeding. WoW's golden age is behind us, I don't have a bubble that needs to be burst.<br />
<br />
The ones that are scared of this and will argue it are the ones who are so trapped with their importance in this fantasy world and the thought, just the mere thought, of it someday ending terrifies them. All your accomplishments (yawn) and climbing to an important position (raid leader, trade chat troll, perhaps even a guild master!) are threatened each and every time you hear of Wow's demise.<br />
<br />
And that is what fuels your Blizzard defense. Your pathetic, lonely dependence on a bunch of Orcs, Magic and flying sparkling ponies shows each and every time you try to explain how WoW is &quot;just fine&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nope. It's dead.</div></div><hr />

The reason I play is because of the people who I play with. If they stopped playing, I would too so don't lump me into the people who are addicted crap if you were thinking about it.<br />
<br />
So you play because you need the companionship of your friends in an online MMO. But you're not addicted. I can give ya that then...not an addict. But equally lulz-worthy.<br />
<br />
But perhaps go try to find the front door in your house and find some friends that you don't have pay a membership fee to hang out with. If your online Orc and Goblin buddies suddenly jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?</div></div><hr />

It sounds too much like there was a board meeting lead by some random Suit in upper management. There have (and always been) pages upon pages of perfectly reasonable feedback sent to blizzard by survey, beta reports, and of course the forums. People have spent countless hours showing on multiple levels how and why certain aspects of the game are broken or need changing, many times with mountains of actual data to back up their claims. These same posts have been locked, deleted, ignored, and even ridiculed by the big names of the Blue Posters. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The best example of Blizz not having a clue, and being completely fueled by a non-gamer's business decision that I can remember is the integrated VOIP fiasco. Only the most casual of players, who had never heard of voice chat previously supported it. The quality was terrible. The interface was terrible. No one used it. Those who did found that it's functionality was spotty at best. Yet Blizz pressed. Blizz locked negative threads. Blizz insisted that it was the best thing since sliced bread. Blizz simply refused to admit it was a terrible addition, and the resources were best put into *anything* else. Take a step back and that same scenario is the game as a whole. <br />
<br />
<br />
For me, The beginning of the end was when Kael'Thas was nerfed way back in the later months of TBC. A beautiful fight, tuned to perfection, EZ-moded so any yahoo could complete it. I quit a Top 100 US guild while we were 4/6 Sunwell. Returned for the 2nd half of LK but did not enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

When the trend is going DOWN - that's a bad thing. When a million people (or as Blizzard refers to them: $15 million dollars in monthly revenue) suddenly vanishes, that remaining number isn't as important as trying to stop the bleeding. WoW's golden age is behind us, I don't have a bubble that needs to be burst.<br />
<br />
The ones that are scared of this and will argue it are the ones who are so trapped with their importance in this fantasy world and the thought, just the mere thought, of it someday ending terrifies them. All your accomplishments (yawn) and climbing to an important position (raid leader, trade chat troll, perhaps even a guild master!) are threatened each and every time you hear of Wow's demise.<br />
<br />
And that is what fuels your Blizzard defense. Your pathetic, lonely dependence on a bunch of Orcs, Magic and flying sparkling ponies shows each and every time you try to explain how WoW is &quot;just fine&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nope. It's dead.<br />
<br />
Why do you care so much about what people enjoy? Is a &quot;fun&quot; game defined as one that millions of people play and are satisfied with? The amount of pretentiousness in your post is rather disturbing, and I implore that you get off of your high horse before you fall off it. No one (ok, maybe a few freaks) here is worried about their &quot;lonely dependence&quot; on their characters. The reason why the &quot;remaining number&quot; of subscribers is not important to most of us is because a good game is not defined by the amount of people who play it or the amount of people who leave. A good game is a subjective definition that is defined by each unique user. You may not like a game where a million people have left over a year, but the rest of us who do not care about that stuff still enjoy our hobby, so why do you feel the need to act holier than thou about it?<br />
<br />
Left 4 Dead 2 (a game that is truly dying) only has 14,000 people playing in its peak hours, but it is still one of the most fun games I have ever played. If you think of video games as a trendy fashion statement rather than a hobby or a fun experience, then I'm not sure any game will satisfy you fully ever.<br />
<br />
Kind of off topic, but if you want to see a game where there are numerous balance issues that have gone unfixed for almost two years now, play Left 4 Dead 2. Many of you whiners would not last a month in that game.</div></div><hr />

That's what I meant. I should have put Ret Paladins rather than Paladins. Still, it seems kinda dumb for Holy Paladins as well. What other healers class has to manage two resources? Just seems silly to me and feels weird.</div></div><hr />

I never said I cared about what they enjoy. People enjoy a lot of things I don't like, and if I clown on them also, it doesn't mean I care. And yes, my high horse is fun to ride, don't like it? Tough. That's where I'm at, and I like it up here. Much better than down below where I once wasted time chasing around Murlocs.<br />
<br />
And if the remaining number of subscribers weren't important to you (or &quot;us&quot; as you describe, I love how a single WoW player feels they're part of this collective) then you wouldn't be responding to what I said.<br />
<br />
See I'm not one of those &quot;omg i quitted wowz and nao i hav girlfriend and i go 2 gym every day&quot; types. I had an enjoyable life before I started playing. I then quickly recognized the time sink involved, and opted out. I watched co-workers around me become consumed by a video game, something that some like to call 'a hobby' but I saw very ordinary people suddenly start shifting family vacations to WoW vacations and taking entire weeks off around expansion releases. Sure, not everyone is like this, but in order to really get much out of the game, you do indeed have to spend a ton of time in it. And plenty of people do.</div></div><hr />

There's that &quot;we&quot; stuff again, do all of you just sit in the same room and take turns? The only desperation here are the WoW addicts trying to convince everyone else they're not addicted and their game is just fine. I'm fairly sure a million accounts canceled is a very real argument. But perhaps that number is too big for you to comprehend.<br />

One of your first posts, defending blizz for having mostly recycled assets.<br />
<br />
As well, you misinterpreted what he said. The core of the game is dead, and while the term is somewhat figurative, the underlying meaning is pretty solid. If this was a healthy game, at worst the attitude of the community would be a 50/50 split between &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;unhappy&quot;. This forum is certainly not even close to that ratio; nor is any other forum, official included.<br />
<br />
The population of a forum is not representative of the population of the game. The population of vocal people on a forum isn't even representative of the forum, let alone the game as a whole. That is a pretty basic thing you should understand. <br />
<br />
People are more inclined to be vocal about their feelings when they are unhappy than when they are happy. This is why you see protests when people are upset, but not &quot;Everything is awesome!&quot; gatherings when everything is going well.<br />
<br />
Do not try to take what you see on forums as representative of the attitude of the wow playing population as a whole. It is depressingly naive.</div></div><hr />

Man your power of omnipresence is so awsome, wait no it isn't cause the people who got me into this game were IRL friends. Damn man, come on now you can do alot better. So what are you gonna say next since IRL friends got me into this game? That me AND my IRL are losers who support Blizzard? That me and my IRL need to get outside and enjoy the fresh sunshine (if you say this I will feel REALLY bad for you). Yea I enjoy companionship in and out of game like any normal person would. It is sad that you look down apon in game companionship, you know, SOMETHING that is encourage in any MMO. Interaction is interaction via in game or voice chat. There is a huge problem if all that was talked about was in game stuff with these people I just know from in game, but OMG, I don't. Seriously, just give up, you don't know me, or anyone in this forum so don't bother trying. Like I said, I agree that alot of people left cause the core game to them is dead, but noone, not you, mean or even Blizzard knows why they lost all the subs they have.

<br />
the CORE are usually people whom post on the forums.<br />
<br />
it seems you have trouble reading all the words in a sentence, but if you bothered you might be able to put into context some of the things people are saying. Instead you twist the statement into something else, to defend your paper thin argument.<br />
<br />
The core of wow is dead. The forums are but one sign of it. The million lost subs are another. Writing on the wall.<br />
<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Going back to the original statement, it is laughable all the rules they have to put into their statement to cover all the things they have been doing for years:<br />
<br />
Concerns that your feedback is being ignored or that we don’t take these kind of posts seriously, Blizz is guilty of all three.<br />
<br />
<br />
Requests for responses to your suggestions or feedback. The purpose of this thread is to get information to us, not the reverse.<br />
<br />
Because apparently this isn't a two way forum, it's a place for their bean counters to gather data, not actually communicate with players.<br />
<br />
Hell they even made a bullet list of things for us to answer. Reading through the first few pages of the rogue forums for example, I can see the common theme being applying poisons and their duration. Changing that won't change the game, it won't change anything about the &quot;fun&quot;, it will essentially do nothing. They don't want to hear our thoughts, they want canned responses to canned questions that ultimately don't address the real issues at hand.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palladiamors</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the norm. Anyone who has been around for ANY length of time know's that they put this out there every now and then to get people fired up. Then they ignore pretty much everything that is suggested. If that were the end of it, then that'd be...not fine, but tolerable. But it goes beyond that. They also ignored, blatantly and OFTEN, feedback off of beta and PTR testing. They've HAD IRREVOCABLE PROOF of problems before, and those problems still went live. They've had classes stay EXTREMELY UNDERPOWERED for years at a time, without doing anything more then making lame excuses why, like calling BM hunters &quot;Leveling specs&quot; or &quot;Pokemon specs&quot;.Also making a prediction now: Blizzard will have some big event around the time that SWs and GW2 are released. I think they missed ONE other major MMO release of that kind in the past six years, FFXIV. Otherwise it's tradition for them to try to trash launch days for other MMORPGs.I also kinda have to laugh at the people citing the number of people still playing to say that WoW is fine. Blizzard THEMSELVES have stated that the number of people who have quit? Outnumber the people who are playing currently. Whoops! Reversed that logic, didn't I? All of a sudden the numbers are stacked AGAINST you. The numbers of people who have quit for one reason or another outnumber the number of people who are actively subscribing. Does that mean WoW is doing bad? No, not yet. But it does mean that Blizzard is either going to have to find a way to attract new subs, or desperately try to get old ones back.Finally, as a jaded vet I have to kind of sigh at the people getting excited about this feedback thing. Maybe they'll prove me wrong this time, but somehow I really doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I, and hundreds of others, gave them extensive feedback during the beta.<br />
<br />
We told them that leveling was way too fast, that there was relatively little to do at max level. We told them that Holy Power lacked depth and was not a very well-thought system. We told them that the new healing and tanking systems felt too homogenized. We warned them of epic queue times, as even on the freaking beta PTR, queues went from instant to &gt; 45 minutes in less than one month. Every single problem and criticism Cata has faced, they knew about 5-6 months before the game launched. Not a single one took them by surprise.<br />
<br />
They CHOSE not to do anything about them. Ghostcrawler even complained that testers weren't being as &quot;helpful&quot; as in years past because we were flooding the beta forums with complaints. Instead of realizing that we were giving negative feedback because Cata was shaping up to be ten flavors of terrible, they accused beta testers of being unhelpful.<br />
<br />
NOW they want feedback? Right, all they want is a way to get players excited for the game at Blizzcon by looking at the list of player concerns where, say, the #1 concern for Paladins is that &quot;Holy power lacks depth and just isn't fun,&quot; and then tell folks at Blizzcon, &quot;We're planning on giving Holy Power more depth and making it more fun.&quot; The crowd goes wild, hearing exactly what they want to, never mind that there were absolutely no specifics given and that this sort of thing usually only translates into something like a new graphic in-game. It's a clever marketing ploy.</div></div><hr />

....Wow ok, first off they don't know why they loss ALL their subs, they can only speculate. They can only assume, cause unlike you they don't have the power of omnipresence. They will never know 100% why ALL of those people left. They can only assume that alot of them got tired of the game, real life came calling, etc. For all we know, those 900k people died off and their families canceled their account (not saying this is the case, but you should know what I am getting at). Do they really know why Bob Johnson in Tampa Bay Florida left WoW...no of course not. They can assume why he left. Seriously the fact I have to say this amazing. So what I said is true, they don't know why, maybe I should have been clearer. Unless you really want to argue that they know each individual reason for all 900k people who left, they don't know. The best they can do speculate using the info they have gathered. I doubt they know why Judy Tsu from New York City left WoW. I doubt that there was a topic on the official forums and all 900k people came on and posted their reason why they left. It is only you apparently who knows 100% why ALL their subs left. I, Blizzard and others on the other hand can only assume and speculate why most left.<br />
<br />
LOL Yup, it is really sad that I have to explain this to you. In order to meet friends in real life (I think IRL went above your head.) I have to get OUT of my &quot;basement&quot; as you put it and MEET people. Let explain how a in real life friendship comes about. First typically you meet a person in real life. This is by job, school, bar, etc. To get to these places, you need to go out. The job is not done yet, you still need to TALK to people in these places in order to even think about having some kind of friendship. So you go and start chatting to people face to face in real life to see if they have the potential to be a friend. Hang out with them more in real life and holy crap they become your friend. All this requires me to leave the &quot;basement&quot; and enter the scary outside world. See, again I have in real life friends, so explain to me how I can make in real life friends in a basement I don't leave? If I was really that guy, I wouldn't even be on here or playing WoW as I stated that it was friends in real life that got me into WoW. You're laughing while everyone else is laughing at you. What is sad, is that I the &quot;basement&quot; guy had to explain the concept of how to make a friend in real life cause you failed to read that I had in real life friends. I am blessed to have friends in real life and in game, sadly you probably can't say that as you probably looked at your guild mates as nothing more than their in game avatars instead of people. Your power of omnipresence has failed you once again.</div></div><hr />

I watched co-workers around me become consumed by a video game, something that some like to call 'a hobby' but I saw very ordinary people suddenly start shifting family vacations to WoW vacations and taking entire weeks off around expansion releases. Sure, not everyone is like this, but in order to really get much out of the game, you do indeed have to spend a ton of time in it. And plenty of people do.<br />
<br />
Sure WoW is addicting. But when you look at addictions from a neutral perspective 99% of people are addicted to tons of things like money, attention, affection, sweets, drugs, their partner, their job (leading to burnout), TV, sex etc and I feel our society reserves the term &quot;addiction&quot; mostly for things that prevent you from working your ass off as long as possible without breaking down. But actually there are a lot of much more dangerous addictions to society and individuals than wow.<br />
I'm really not a wow fanboy I actually haven't subscribed for more than a year due to time constraints and only play a few weeks each expansion but I think its still the best videogame so this is still one of my favourite poisons/addictions if I had to choose one.<br />
The few people who aren't addicted in western cultures are mostly masters of meditation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We told them that leveling was way too fast, that there was relatively little to do at max level. We told them that Holy Power lacked depth and was not a very well-thought system. We told them that the new healing and tanking systems felt too homogenized. We warned them of epic queue times, as even on the freaking beta PTR, queues went from instant to &gt; 45 minutes in less than one month. Every single problem and criticism Cata has faced, they knew about 5-6 months before the game launched. Not a single one took them by surprise.<br />
<br />
They CHOSE not to do anything about them. Ghostcrawler even complained that testers weren't being as &quot;helpful&quot; as in years past because we were flooding the beta forums with complaints. Instead of realizing that we were giving negative feedback because Cata was shaping up to be ten flavors of terrible, they accused beta testers of being unhelpful.<br />
<br />
NOW they want feedback? Right, all they want is a way to get players excited for the game at Blizzcon by looking at the list of player concerns where, say, the #1 concern for Paladins is that &quot;Holy power lacks depth and just isn't fun,&quot; and then tell folks at Blizzcon, &quot;We're planning on giving Holy Power more depth and making it more fun.&quot; The crowd goes wild, hearing exactly what they want to, never mind that there were absolutely no specifics given and that this sort of thing usually only translates into something like a new graphic in-game. It's a clever marketing ploy.<br />
<br />
<br />
This pretty much summarizes what went wrong in Cata. Blizzard was changing the game for one reason and trying to sell players on the idea it really was for another. When players did not buy into that they then decided the players were the problem. The whole expansion reminds me of another game (well there are countless examples), that being AC2. A game which really felt as if it were a monument to the developers, stuffed full of crap that simply was their to boost their egos. <br />
<br />
Cata was Blizzards great attempt to fix Arena play. Arena play, and PvP in most cases, had turned into a burst fest. Blizzard incontinently ignores the fact they create this situation over and over again with their gearflation. So to fix it they needed huge health pools to prevent players being taken out in seconds. Big health pools meant that healing had to be changed else no one would die. So they quadrupled the cost of heals versus their output to minimize that impact. They then hamstrung shamans by nuking their totems and then tossed everyone who was used to their healing class a boner by swapping around who could cleanse what. <br />
<br />
Blizzard only wanted feedback that agreed with what they were thinking. The last thing they wanted to hear was that changes to tanking or the extreme healer changes were not desired or working. Any feedback of the sort was either ignored, deleted, or met with the threat of ban from forums. Well they got what they deserved, they lost a million subscriptions. Whats more telling and I bet they have numbers, people play far less than they used to. I am quite sure they know the average time per account and how it has dropped. <br />
<br />
The guild I started with from way back when easily had forty plus on during prime time. Yeah we had our share of short bus players, but we had good people. We could field a 25 or two 10s and while never tops for the server we weren't pug quality either. Yet within days of catas release we had a problem and in weeks it was an epidemic. People who only loved to heal were dropping like flies. Some of the tanks went either because their friends (who usually were the healers went) or they didn't like how the new instances made them feel ineffective; its not fun when most of your tanking skills are circumvented by cheesy npc abilities or outright ignored (like interrupting a mobs cast only to have it instantly start the same spell again or worse - its immune or its damage is 360 so facing it meaningless). By the middle of January we couldn't get twenty online at a time. Sister guilds and guilds many of use had friends in faces the same issues. Posting about it certainly didn't help.<br />
<br />
So I really doubt Blizzard's honesty here. They didn't listen before because they had already decided on what the outcome would be. Likely they already have.</div></div><hr />

Very good post, I firmly agree with this, and the post quoted in the first place<br />
<br />
<br />
Excellent. More feedback for them to collect and discard.<br />
<br />
and this pretty much sums up my thoughts entirely. I mean they ask for feedback on the classes and go on to say this, &quot;Concerns that your current damage, healing or tanking is not competitive. While this kind of feedback is often useful, it also is the kind of thing that can change from patch to patch, and so it isn’t as useful for long term vision changes&quot; So wth are they actually looking for us to say to them? o_0</div></div><hr />

<br />
THis a thousand times this. Combine this with just about everything GC said to be the complete opposite of what actually happened (instant death mechanics, talent trees give choice (eyeroll) etc etc) It's pretty obvious he was hired for his ability to cut development costs. It worked to a degree but the sub losses have now overtaken &quot;player monetization&quot;. You can only suck so much out of your player base before they get disgusted or wise up.<br />
<br />
People forget the original developers who started WoW are now middle age people(edit:changed men to people), if you honestly believe they are more interested in &quot;gaming&quot; than they are in increasing their wealth you are woefully naive.<br />
<br />
edit: Blizzcon is a perfect example of their greed, at one time they said they would only hold it if they had new content and design to talk about. Then Blizzcon started to make shitloads of money now they hold it every year regardless of whether they have anything to talk about.<br />
Last years was a perfect example, they didn't release one new thing about Cataclysm at Blizzcon that wasn't already known.<br />

Everytime someone cancels a subscription they have an opportunity to write the reasons why the have quit. Hence Blizzard have a documented reason why people are leaving. The feedback provided is driving some of thier decisions<br />
<br />
Not anymore, you are now given 5 (I think) bullet points that Blizzard conveniently fills in for you and in my case did not even come close to why I canceled.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MikeyD</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">....Wow ok, first off they don't know why they loss ALL their subs, they can only speculate. They can only assume, cause unlike you they don't have the power of omnipresence. They will never know 100% why ALL of those people left. They can only assume that alot of them got tired of the game, real life came calling, etc. For all we know, those 900k people died off and their families canceled their account (not saying this is the case, but you should know what I am getting at). Do they really know why Bob Johnson in Tampa Bay Florida left WoW...no of course not. They can assume why he left. Seriously the fact I have to say this amazing. So what I said is true, they don't know why, maybe I should have been clearer. Unless you really want to argue that they know each individual reason for all 900k people who left, they don't know. The best they can do speculate using the info they have gathered. I doubt they know why Judy Tsu from New York City left WoW. I doubt that there was a topic on the official forums and all 900k people came on and posted their reason why they left. It is only you apparently who knows 100% why ALL their subs left. I, Blizzard and others on the other hand can only assume and speculate why most left.<br />
<br />
LOL Yup, it is really sad that I have to explain this to you. In order to meet friends in real life (I think IRL went above your head.) I have to get OUT of my &quot;basement&quot; as you put it and MEET people. Let explain how a in real life friendship comes about. First typically you meet a person in real life. This is by job, school, bar, etc. To get to these places, you need to go out. The job is not done yet, you still need to TALK to people in these places in order to even think about having some kind of friendship. So you go and start chatting to people face to face in real life to see if they have the potential to be a friend. Hang out with them more in real life and holy crap they become your friend. All this requires me to leave the &quot;basement&quot; and enter the scary outside world. See, again I have in real life friends, so explain to me how I can make in real life friends in a basement I don't leave? If I was really that guy, I wouldn't even be on here or playing WoW as I stated that it was friends in real life that got me into WoW. You're laughing while everyone else is laughing at you. What is sad, is that I the &quot;basement&quot; guy had to explain the concept of how to make a friend in real life cause you failed to read that I had in real life friends. I am blessed to have friends in real life and in game, sadly you probably can't say that as you probably looked at your guild mates as nothing more than their in game avatars instead of people. Your power of omnipresence has failed you once again.<br />
<br />
Wow I touched a nerve there, was it the fact that your only friends in life are in a video game? Perhaps it's your guild? Awful defensive there with the wall of text about how you make friends.<br />
<br />
LOL and you just love that word omnipresence. You should write an entire post using only that word.<br />
<br />
People like you are the ones that get laughed at, when you can't be playing WoW for whatever reason, here you are on websites and discussion forums talking about it. Talk about consumed, man.<br />
<br />
And then you go on explanation to a total stranger trying to convince them that you have friends &quot;IRL&quot;. Sure ya do, man.<br />
<br />
Just keep on living out your fantasy here, that you have friends, that you aren't addicted to WoW, and that you're not in your mommy's basement.</div></div><hr />

Not really. If you aren't enjoying your class then there is no way you are going to enjoy the game, and right now classes in general aren't very enjoyable. They know what they need to do to fix the bulk of the game, they made this game and they made it damn good originally. They can make it good again. I hope anyway.</div></div><hr />

LOL yeah, reading a couple articles by WoW bloggers is much more consumed than someone who plays WoW 4+ hours a day...and then also spends time talking about it and defending it on message boards. Let's take you, for example, 109 posts, all with fanboyish themes.<br />

I teach Freshman composition at Texas Tech (RED RAIDERS!) and I'm working on my Master's in English literature and I have time to raid heroic firelands (6/7).

Been waiting really long time before Blizzard starts to listen feedback. So here is my 2 cents. If you really want to IMPROVE your pos game. For the love of God remove all Blizzard PLAYERS from the servers. EU-Sporeggar server has more blizzard workers playing than actual players. if this preferred option is not possible INTRODUCE HEROIC SERVERS WHERE NO BLIZZARD WORKER is playing. Blizzard worker playing means here not just means random blizzard personnel spending 2 hours night in a random server but than actual worker who is being paid to play full time in servers.

Casting in pvp has become a nuisance. I play a healer and have been since pre bc, healing in cata pvp is so un-enjoyable no wonder people are leaving. Why play a healer when you can play a dps spam damage, easily stop heals and win. So many interrupts in the game now and thats not even the hard part. Say someone misses an interrupt there are so many cc spells now that they can just use one of those to stop a cast. Even with this sucky pvp going on there are some more frustrating things like queue times and how you fight the same team over and over. Other than all this game imbalances are just too much to handle. my friends and I are all glad ranged players and we have noticed that nowadays the damage difference between a 2k player and a 2700 player is no different. Its so easy to do damage now. Too hard to heal and just not rewarding to play.</div></div><hr />

No you're right, but they've got all the data they need. They don't need to 'take it back' to an earlier time, but they do need to build on what made the game great. They didn't do that with Cata, they tried to breath new life into the game, to bring back vets and attract new customers, and they failed miserably. There was the usual &quot;Expansion spike&quot; but in no time flat that wore off, and they began to bleed out subs. Wow still has a ton of subs, but I would still consider this expansion a failure, at least in terms of WoW's success.</div></div><hr />

Oh I completely agree with you, I was so excited for it and everything and to be honest I havent logged in but once in the last.. week or two. It was just reduced to doing dailies everyday and running the same exact dungeons i've ran 200 times. Their is just... nothing to do end game outside of raiding and im not so much into raiding. this expansion blows in my opinion. I just wish they actually took what their customers said and used that to better the game, vs saying &quot;we want feedback&quot; and never actually listening to it.</div></div><hr />

LOL I almost, ALMOST was gonna post you were gonna say &quot;did I hit a nerve&quot; I didn't cause I thought you had the ability to actually think outside the box. If you hit a nerve, I'll be honest and say you did, but you didn't. You saying &quot;awful defense&quot; = &quot;I can't figure out how to counter what he just said.&quot; You called me a stereotypical guy who lives in his basement in his parents house and proved you wrong. Don't give there is &quot;nothing to counter&quot; statement, everyone knows you called me that and going by what I said about myself, I can't that &quot;basement&quot; guy. Basement guy doesn't go out and make in real friends lol. I guess again that concept passed over your head and the fact I said I had real life friends flew over your head as now you're making claims that my real life friends are in a video game. You know I can prove you wrong any time I want, but I won't. You're not worth it cause you are a troll. Funny thing is, I am not the only one who thinks that lol. As for omnipresence, I choose the word that best describes the situation. It isn't everyday that I get to use that word that is for sure, but I am sure as hell not gonna type &quot;your ability to look at the lives of many at the same time.&quot; Just be happy I expanded your vocabulary by one word. With that said Mr. Troll, please oh please visit Texas (I don't live in Texas) and share your wonderful view of that state and its people, you would make me a happy man. I am done with you and your horrible attempts to of trying to read into my life and lives of 1000s especially since you are terribly failing at it (lol time consumed...I don't even have 200 posts and my account on here is barely 2 years old). Please respond to this if you want (I won't respond back for obvious reasons lol), give the good people on here a laugh :).</div></div><hr />
