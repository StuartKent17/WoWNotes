<br />
Beast Mastery<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug with Spirit Mend (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/90361-spirit-mend) that caused it to heal for less than intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Uldir<br />
<br />
Zul, Reborn<br />
<br />
Zul's health has been reduced by 5% on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Developers’ note: Tides of Vengeance removed the Subtlety Rogue passive Shuriken Combo, which was a core part of many guilds’ strategy on this fight. We’re reducing Zul’s health to avoid the update increasing the difficulty of the fight for guilds that were relying on Shuriken Combo.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Synaptic Spark Capacitor (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/280174-synaptic-spark-capacitor) damage decreased 32%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that allowed some Battle For Azeroth crafted gear to be worn by player characters who no longer had the crafting skill to create it.<br />
Cooking<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth flasks and feasts now increase the primary stat for tanks (was Stamina).<br />
Cooks can now learn and serve new Stamina foods.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think all tanks will be happy with that change. I like that they added individual stamina food too so that if any situation a tank really does want the extra health they still have the option.</div></div><hr />

If you can't tell, this is a joke. It's a joke much like the 2018 Blizzard development team. What a fucking cringefest this year has been, and may 2019 become the year where blizzard fires a bunch of incompetent soccerdads, and hires the good old neckbeards to do video games again. <br />
<br />
Can't even comprehend giving out achievements properly, let alone resetting AK. (but yo pls give $15 a month)</div></div><hr />

Nerfing that many traits by the exact same amount this quickly can be interpreted as nothing other than a knee-jerk reaction designed to destroy those traits efficacy.<br />
<br />
There is no way that it just so happened that an exact 50% nerf to 23 abilities has now created &quot;balance&quot; in their spreadsheets. They might as well have just said, &quot;We forgot about PvP. Please don't use these traits in PvP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good grief.</div></div><hr />

If they had balanced the traits for PvP before launch that would have been the first time they didn't forget about PvP.</div></div><hr />

I've played wow since day 1 and the bugs now are no different than they used to be. Anyone that says otherwise is either in denial or has memory problems. Second, wow remains a much better experience than most games in terms of bugs on patch days and in live. Go play Fallout76 for perspective on what real bugs look like. <br />
<br />
And for the record, I'm not a fanboi. I'm unsubbed and don't enjoy the game in it's current incarnation. But it's worth setting the record straight for people like you that obviously don't have much experience with games outside of wow.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />
