<br />
Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 8<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
(In progress) Players should no longer be stopped abruptly when executing uncontrolled movement spells such as Roll, Fel Rush, and Flying Serpent Kick.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#VAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
(PvP) Holy Word: Chastise will no longer remove periodic damaging effects from targets in PvE situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
Black Rook Hold<br />
<br />
Fel Vomit from the Smashspite the Hateful encounter in Black Rook Hold will no longer persist after the encounter is defeated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The secondary stats on Legion gems have been significantly decreased.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Gems are not in the same place as they were in previous expansions. They’re a bit too powerful, and this was not intended. Sockets are still quite valuable and will continue to be so, but we need to reduce the difference between an item having a socket vs. not having a socket.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Ashran<br />
<br />
Ashran Dominance now rewards 500 honor for completion.<br />
Slay Them All now rewards 200 honor for completion.<br />
<br />
Honor awarded from skirmishes has been tripled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Enchanting Rank 2 and Rank 3 recipes now have the “Requires Previous Rank” text.<br />
Mass Prospecting should now return the same amount of gems as normal Prospecting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Players can now complete &quot;WANTED: Shara Felbreath&quot; after leaving combat and returning.<br />
Enemies should now have lower health and damage in Chapter 3 of the Warrior Class Hall scenario.<br />
A marker on your map should now appear for the objective of the Stormheim quest “The Trials Continue”.<br />
Marksman hunters who left Niskara without talking to Vereesa can speak to her at Krassus' Landing to complete the &quot;Rescue Mission&quot; quest.<br />
The Mage Order Campaign quest &quot;What Is Going On Here&quot; objectives should now complete reliably.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suramar<br />
<br />
Blackhawk's Bulwark PvP Captains should respawn more quickly.<br />
Fel Cannons in Felsoul Hold should respawn more quickly.<br />
The World Quest map marker for Starstalker Point Alliance has been moved to its accurate location.<br />
During “Ghostship”, players can no longer use the Valarjar Harpoon to damage other players or player controlled NPCs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. It just goes to show that Illidan has always loved Tyrande, and despite knowing that she and Malfurion<br />
are an item, he never stopped loving her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have any indication how far you need to get into the questline? Last I remember I did the quest called &quot;Awakenings&quot;, ever since that Light's Heart has just been silent, not giving any new quests/missions or anything related to it. Does it require to unlock something special or?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it was just highlighting that in Illidan's quest for power, he sacrificed a potential relationship with Tyrande. And while he definitely regrets that loss, Illidan is a tragic hero because his choice of power is what saved / will save Azeroth.<br />
<br />
PS they totally retconned Illidan's last words!</div></div><hr />

WoD had quite a few compared to the rest, but there is a massive storytelling potential in what Blizz are doing this time around.</div></div><hr />

I dont think it said anywhere or was hinted anywhere that he stopped loving her, he just was upset with how it all went between the 3<br />

i think that is client side so that will come with the next build update.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll probably show up after a couple of weeks. After &quot;Awakening&quot; there's at least two more quests. One takes place in Black Rook Hold, the other involves the cinematic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it DH only?<br />
<br />
Nope, everyone gets it, like already stated. Just get Light's Heart, do the &quot;Awakening&quot; quest that shows you a scene in Val'sharah, and the following quests will eventually show up when they are released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tyrande already told Illidan why she chose his brother over him. Illidan is a magic junkie who constantly subverts his noble intentions because of his hunger for raw power, which he thinks is the real way to get what he needs and get things done.<br />
<br />
Malf and Tyrande have a relationship as peers where they don't put each other on a pedestal, they are stable enough to argue and criticize each others actions and decisions without it hurting their relationship. Its not a lack of respect, they just don't patronize each other or fear disagreement. They also mutually realize that their duty (as Archdruid, Priestess of the Moon and mutual Leaders of the Night Elves) comes first above their love for each other. They have the emotional strength to mutually understand and accept this as who they are. Their integrity and adherence to their duty is one of the things that brought them together.<br />
<br />
Malf is the guy who would love her forever but put the greater good first, just as she would (and has, in Legion). He's the guy who wanted to do good, and got it DONE, just like her. Which person in their right mind wouldn't fall for that.<br />
<br />
Edit: its also important to remember that Tyrande is the woman who would love Malf forever. She made a choice.</div></div><hr />
