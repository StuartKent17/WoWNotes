Cross-Realm Zones Coming to Beta<br />
In the World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria beta, we’re introducing a new technology that will enable players to meet up and group with other players in under populated areas of the world such as low level zones or areas that other players may have outleveled or moved on from. This technology will allow players to form a group with other players from within a select pool of realms in order to quest just like they normally would while still allowing the social structures of their home realms to remain intact.<br />
<br />
During the initial phase of testing we will be sharing the following zones between the available beta realms: Northern Barrens, Ashenvale, Azshara, Darkshore, Westfall, and Silithus. We are also able to split over-populated zones and will be testing this new technology on the Pandaren starting area (turtle zone).<br />
<br />
For beta testing purposes, we will be matching up all realm types whether they are PvP or PvE. This is different than what we plan to do for the live realms, however. For the live realms we will be matching realm types: PvP with PvP, PvE with PvE, RP-PvP with RP-PvP, and RP-PvE with RP-PvE. As always, we plan to keep an eye on constructive feedback while in testing of this new technology.<br />
<br />
F.A.Q.<br />
<br />
Q. Why cross-realm zones?<br />
For many years now, the significant majority of the player population online at any given time has consisted mostly of characters at or near the level cap. This has resulted in an environment where characters that are leveling up experience a world that has fewer other players to interact with than what the world was designed for. Cross-realm zones give us the capability to ensure that level-up zones retain a population size that feels more like the high level areas of the game, leading to a more fun play experience for characters of all levels.<br />
<br />
Q. How do cross-realm zones work?<br />
When you’re in a zone that is set as a ‘cross-realm zone’ you’ll notice that in addition to the players you’d ordinarily see from your realm, you’ll also see (and be able to play with) players from other realms. This will happen seamlessly, and players will be able to group and quest as they normally would with players from their own realm.<br />
<br />
Q. How will this work on boats or zeppelins?<br />
Usually transitions will occur on area boundaries (think moving from Darkshore to Ashenvale). <br />
<br />
Q. Can I form groups with the people I meet in the zone?<br />
Yes! You can group and talk to others within the cross-server zone normally though trading will be restricted much as it is within raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Q. Will my cross-realm group be disbanded if we move on to an adjacent zone together, like from Goldshire to Westfall or from Thousand Needles to Feralas?<br />
Much like how cross-realm groups currently work, your party won’t be disbanded when you move through different zones, though if you’re not in the same home realm, you won’t be able to see each other if you’re in separate zone instances.<br />
<br />
Q. Will I be able to group with my friends?<br />
Yes, you will be able to group with your Real ID friends, provided they are within the same faction. The functionality works the same as it does for cross-realm dungeons, raids, or Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Q. What level range do my friends and I have to be within in order to group?<br />
There is no restriction on level ranges. You’ll be able to group with anyone you would normally be able to.<br />
<br />
Q. Can I go into main capital cities while grouped with others?<br />
Capital cities and areas with regularly high populations will not be set as cross-server areas/zones so you will not be able to enter into the same instance of a city as someone who is from a different realm.<br />
<br />
Q. Will I be able to trade with others I meet?<br />
Trading restrictions are in place much the same as they are in cross-realm dungeons, raids, and battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Q. How is group loot handled?<br />
Group looting will function the same as it would with any group you would create through normal play.<br />
<br />
Q. Who will I be playing with?<br />
You’ll be able to interact with players from within a select pool of realms which will make it possible to run into a player in Redridge that you already ran into within Westfall.<br />
<br />
Q. What areas will be shared?<br />
This can vary from realm to realm and relies on how densely populated (or underpopulated) an area is. Capital cities and areas with regularly high populations will not be eligible for area sharing.<br />
<br />
Q. What about resources or gathering nodes, will those be shared too?<br />
Resources and nodes will be available to all parties within the shared area the same as always. We will be keeping a close eye on the impact of area sharing and should an area become too populated, we are capable of adjusting how many realms are able to connect to a shared area.<br />
<br />
Q. Does this mean that Auction Houses will be merged?<br />
No, when any player access an Auction House, they will be only able to access their home realm’s Auction House.<br />
<br />
Q. What about zones that are already overpopulated, like new race starting zones?<br />
With this technology, we can also flag zones to allow for more than one copy of that zone per realm. Players on that realm will be split among those copies in order to alleviate problems due to overpopulation. Players won’t normally see or interact with those on a different instance of their zone, although joining a party will relocate all party members to a single instance of that zone.<br />
<br />
Q. How will this work for PvP vs. PvE realms? Will these realm types be shared?<br />
No. Realm types will be matched with like realm types. So if you’re on a PvE realm, you’ll only be matched with other PvE realms. The same rules will apply for matching RP realm types and will be restricted to matching RP-PvP with RP-PvP and RP-PvE with RP-PvE. We plan to keep an eye on constructive feedback while testing this new technology.<br />
<br />
Q. How will RID groups work? Which realm type would we play on?<br />
If you group up with somebody from a different rule type (via RealID for example) and go into a cross-realm zone you’ll be on the ruleset for that player’s realm type. So, if you’re on a PvP realm and a friend joins your group from a PvE realm and enters a cross-realm zone, the group will be in one of the PvP realm clusters and will use the PvP realm ruleset. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I really don't see any reason to group with others when everything is so easy to do at the lower levels. All these other people will be doing is killing my mobs and taking my resources.<br />
The game is specifically designed with variable respawns, and huge influxes of players on launches. Having very few people in a zone is actually not what the game is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Q: Will be have to zone to every zone from now on then?<br />
No, it's as seamless as it is today.</div></div><hr />

Who's to say they're not? They're doing mounts, pets, achievements, and zones. My guess is that they're trying to find the best way to do it.</div></div><hr />

This then makes leveling extremely boring when we have a 90 boosting us through dungeons ;s takes all the fun away.</div></div><hr />

Else I am completely fine with this idea, it sounds very fun.<br />
<br />
Edit: and what about PvE and PvP servers? You can't really say anymore &quot;PvP on a PvP server&quot;, when you are in a PvE server that has zoned together with a PvP zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't queue for instances while levelling to be boosted by a level 85 stranger. If I want boosting, that's what I ask for. Please don't break a perfectly good system with this sort of short sighted suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people may call this a joke, but I actually think this is possible. Right now there are actually zones that have no server. It's a free-for-all. I could easily see this expanded along those lines.<br />
<br />
Not to mention cross-realm guilds, grouping, the idea of server will become just a way of catagorizing players, not an actually used mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe only the zones of the same Servers Types are shard?<br />
At least the PvPs and PvE must be seperated.<br />
<br />
With this system the can even auto balancing the Factions on PvP servers with it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much this.<br />
<br />
I hope that the selection of servers will be large (say the same as a battleground group) so that there is a decent population to pull from.<br />
<br />
Soon enough I hope we move away from Home Servers and that everything is just instanced (although could cause issues as well but less so) as nothing sucks more than a dead server.</div></div><hr />

No. Because then you just solo everything.<br />

<br />
well with challenge mode dungeons we know that they can scale us down to certain ilevels would be cool if they scaled a lvl 90 down to lvl 18 stats or whatever and then we could run just as if we were 18. our action bars would just have lvl 18 and below spells and everything.</div></div><hr />

how can you even compare this to a server merge? the auction house will still be seperate, you cant enter cities on other servers,etc. This will turn out as LFR 2.0 aka, more people acting like kids, emo raging and whining about everything.

Because the complaint of people on low pop servers is &quot;we can never find people to do things with.&quot; not &quot;the AH is too empty.&quot;<br />
<br />
This makes it feasable to play a low pop server now. Plus you can make friends cross-server for your 90 content.<br />
<br />
<br />
And LFR 2.0? You're not forced to interact with these people. Turn off general, and don't accept group quests. Better yet, go back to your single-player RPG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, unless you are playing in a near-dead server.<br />
<br />
Even though this change is a very, very pleasant surprise and will breath some life back into low-populated realms(not to mention world PvP!)I'm still pretty frustrated with the existence of so many &quot;dead&quot; realms, playing into one - I just hope there's more technology to come regarding this huge issue.<br />
<br />
Once again, awesome move from Blizzard, hats off... Just couldn't help but bring some QQ in regarding the server issue, sick of not being able to form raid groups, the shitty AH and all the loneliness that comes with servers that are almost empty.</div></div><hr />

Else I am completely fine with this idea, it sounds very fun.<br />
<br />
Edit: and what about PvE and PvP servers? You can't really say anymore &quot;PvP on a PvP server&quot;, when you are in a PvE server that has zoned together with a PvP zone.<br />
<br />
they already said they can choose which servers get grouped up. they'll probably take all of the rp servers and group them up. same with pvp and pve. they would just make sure the zone pools are made up of the same types.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't change a thing to the raiding community of a server. What they need to do is to merge multiple small/low/medium pop realms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds really Great.<br />
<br />
But does that mean the players from other servers will just suddenly appear out of nowhere if an area gets too low?<br />
<br />
Does it ever deactivate? What if the density gets too high after the merger is activated? Will all the other players from other servers just suddenly vanish? Group mates and PvP opponents just vanishing?<br />
<br />
I just don't really see how the feature can ever deactivate without it impacting players. And if it doesn't deactivate, I don't see why they wouldn't just put it on by default.</div></div><hr />

I dont want to make friends x-realm. I want to make friends on my own server, form a community etc. Clearly you didnt play in vanilla or TBC when community actually mattered?

And I dare to say this is just the 1st step to a global server for each region, with every zone dynamicly instancing people in and out to have virtualy no empty or full server, just different phases with about the same amount of people on all of them.

When i logged into beta after the first annual pass invite wave, my first thought was: Wtf have they done to their server architecture to support that many toons in one subarea? Seems they are switching to a highly scalable cloud architecture - and one performing really well for that matter.<br />
<br />
This also kind of validates that MoP Beta was first and foremost a stress test for their new server-tech and was planned as such from the very beginning. <br />
<br />
I just don't know if i like the implications that this technology shift is giving me for the future of the game itself. On one side - it would allow to do away with sperate servers alltogether several years down the road and could potentially enable feature like housing. On the other side the concept of confinement to a certain group of people on your server to play with will be gone for good and players will need to rely on meta-systems (like facebook, real life acquaintences, etc.) to organize groups.<br />
<br />
For me, personally, a guy that has no facebook account and is generally pretty sensitive about his privacy on the net that's no good omen. And the oldschool-mmorpg player inside me weeps silently, too. Well at least the tech-guy-me is impressed ^^.<br />
<br />
Still - considering RMAH for Diablo 3, massively scalable server architecture for WoW, Bnet 2.0 features (especially connectability) and progressively advancing automation in support tasks ... my thoughs wander towards Titan, and i guess ... it won't be a game for me. *sigh* I gues i'm getting old :(</div></div><hr />

i dont think it will be handled dynamically.<br />

on a sidenote, i dont like this change. i prefer underpopulated realms for several reaons, for example you actually encounter rares regularly, you have the feeling of being THE hero and it feels more like an accomplishment to do something hard alone instead of in a group.</div></div><hr />

When i logged into beta after the first annual pass invite wave, my first thought was: Wtf have they done to their server architecture to support that many toons in one subarea? Seems they are switching to a highly scalable cloud architecture - and one performing really well for that matter.<br />
<br />
This also kind of validates that MoP Beta was first and foremost a stress test for their new server-tech and was planned as such from the very beginning. <br />
<br />
I just don't know if i like the implications that this technology shift is giving me for the future of the game itself. On one side - it would allow to do away with sperate servers alltogether several years down the road and could potentially enable feature like housing. On the other side the concept of confinement to a certain group of people on your server to play with will be gone for good and players will need to rely on meta-systems (like facebook, real life acquaintences, etc.) to organize groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed, good observation. That's why they kept pushing hundreds of thousands of people in even after the server had long since passed capacity. To test the architecture, and get numbers on what the cieling should be for this feature.</div></div><hr />

Look around, friend. The majority of people commenting see this to be the fix we've been waiting for and possibly the reigniting of World PVP if done correctly.<br />
<br />
Also, there's nothing to stop you doing a cross realm raid with someone you meet in a cross realm zone. They can't join your guild of course, but what's to stop you adding their real ID or even their battletag when that system goes up to call on them to raid with you.</div></div><hr />

Q. What about resources or gathering nodes, will those be shared too?<br />
-Resources and nodes will be available to all parties within the shared area the same as always. We will be keeping a close eye on the impact of area sharing and should an area become too populated, we are capable of adjusting how many realms are able to connect to a shared area.<br />

<br />
Do people always post without reading some comments? They most certainly won't cross PvP + PvE. It just wont happen due to the sheer amount of QQ you'd get from both sides:<br />
<br />
PvE Servers: OMG I JOINED PVE SO I DONT GET GANKED<br />
If crossed with a PvE realm and they don't flag those PvE realmers:<br />
PvP Servers: OMG I JOINED PVP SO I CAN GANK.<br />
<br />
Pretty obvious the pool of servers that'll cross over will be specific to what type of server you chose. I just don't want to be crossed with German/Spanish/Russian/French servers which I also doubt would happen, unless the other faction is a different language, like BG's, well, that's not so bad (unless people like making level 1 characters to hurl abuse at someone who just wiped the floor clean with them).</div></div><hr />

It may well be that one day the moment you step outside of a capital city, you're in a cloud server environment where you see your own server (and others). That would probably allow them to ditch servers and hardware.</div></div><hr />

They have been talking about doing things with heirlooms that would eliminate the need for mailing them to alts altogether. My guess is that they're still trying to figure out the best way to handle it internally. I'm 99% certain that we'll be seeing cross-realm heirlooms before this beta is over, just wait and see.<br />

While this big change is surely good for most of people who like world pvp or are accustomed to playing on high populated servers, it is an awful addition for people like me, who are disgusted with wow pvp in any form and are playing in low populated servers. This is because of the economy of low pop. servers - it is bad, everything is overpriced, rare items are very hard to be found, but on the bright side there are a few serious material gatherers for example, so if you have gathering alts, mats are easy to come by. Now with this change, low populated servers become like medium or even high populated ones, but their economy stays the same, it will be even worse, because less mining nodes and herbs will actually be fueling the economy. This will destroy auction houses on low populated servers.</div></div><hr />

You really think blizzard will merge PVE / PVP players unless grouped ? No. They aren't that stupid. It only makes sense that they will pull from the same server type unless grouped. I will assume that if you have a friend that is on a PVP server, invites you to a group and you are on a PVE server, you would then move to a PVP zone due to the invite coming from a PVP server.<br />
<br />
This is a move in the right direction for all MMO's. There shouldn't be servers any more, this is just the first step to make it truly a &quot;World&quot;. It is called WORLD of Warcraft, now SERVERS of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
I couldn't be more happy with it, I play an MMO to play with other people not to play in a world by myself. The addition of the Battletag system will perpetuate this even more, so that players can group together easier and actually have fun out in the world again.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh really? i play on a very low pop server and the only influence this might offer to me is the decline of the last advangtages low pop servers offer. not only is our ah empty but then players from high pop servers can roam my realm and farm the ores to sell on their ah. gg. <br />

<br />
Except you don't understand how it works, no one actually plays on &quot;Your&quot; realm, nor do you play on your own realm either. You are going to be on an instance of that zone which is separate from any other server. While I can understand the complacency of being on a Low pop realm , the faster that it transitions to a &quot;World&quot; rather than individual servers, community will thrive. Those ass hats that group up to be douchebags will get black listed &quot;world&quot; wide rather then a specific server.</div></div><hr />

Thing is they dont do that for any xrealm transfer issue. This is done for new toons and it was never a problem to click on change realm and start toon w/e you want to. Xrealm transfers is mostly for maxed chars and they barely will get affected by this if i have read that blue post right.

@Kadaje: We'll be matching realm types when this goes to the live realms. (We will add a Q&amp;A in the above FAQ to make that clear.)<br />
@Rogarb: The game is specifically designed with variable respawns, and huge influxes of players on launches. Having very few people in a zone is actually not what the game is supposed to be.<br />

<br />
The main problem I see with this is the same issue we have seen with LFR/LFG - certain people from other servers seem to think its acceptaible to grief-play to varying extents as they can 'get away with it' without any of the social reprecussions you'd get if you were acting badly towards someone on your own server. Want to ninja a mob? sure why not, you'll never seen that guy again. Want to get into a random flame war in general chat? go right ahead, your guild won't know etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
We will have to wait and see how it all turns out in practice, but I can definately see potential for this to become a double-edged sword.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don´t know, there is a problem, what will happen when Blizzard place together a PVP and PVE server together? what will happen then? or will they make Cross-realm Zones for servers that are of the same time, i mean a PVP server with another PVP server, A PVE server with another PVE server, RP server with RP or/and PVE (If it´s RP only, i mean not RP-PVP)?<br />
<br />
-Roleplayers these will make RP harder but at the same time it will make it easier to RP with more people<br />
<br />
-There are some server that are divided by language, what will happen to these? will they be united like in LFG/LFR? Example: Stormrage and Ragnaros</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ganking is working as intended. It's one of the reasons I play this game. As much as I like destroying questing 85s, it is wonderful to obliterate in one mighty ambush some tinysmall levelling hordie.<br />
<br />
However, it would be very unfair to someone who has opted out of being ganked (aka, rolled on a pve server) to be flagged.<br />
Likewise, it would be ludicrous to be the only flagged guy in a field of blue because I rolled on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
Bashiok did clarify this, and realm type will be matched.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty obvious the pool of servers that'll cross over will be specific to what type of server you chose. I just don't want to be crossed with German/Spanish/Russian/French servers which I also doubt would happen, unless the other faction is a different language, like BG's, well, that's not so bad (unless people like making level 1 characters to hurl abuse at someone who just wiped the floor clean with them). <br />
<br />
Heh, no problem. I find all horde speak dagger-in-the-spine remarkably well. Or maybe it's just my talent with getting the, uh, point across.<br />

So now instead of being able to just quest I'll always have to compete for mobs sounds terrible would be okay if they just made anyone who contributes to a kill get credit but they have said they don't want to do this( I believe).</div></div><hr />

Well i like your idea, but not the Lvl cap, why? if you don´t want to be killed by a high lvl player, don´t play on a PVP server, i think these is a great idea, these can help the World PVP, but yes i think the PVP realm should Xrealm with another PVP server and PVE with PVE</div></div><hr />

But if this is the way blizz is adressing the low pop realm problems in MoP then I can say that I'm completely unsatisfied and this move was already predictable.<br />
What can the damn cross realm low lvling do to me if I want my guild to recruit fresh raiders? What???<br />
Just doing cross realm LFR, older raids and bgs is not that fun when you just want more people in your realm so you can progress.<br />
I really hope this is not how their will adress the low pop problem else I'm disappointed. And a lot more people will probably think the same and they will either shallow it and transfer to a better populated realm or they will quit. Also I predict quite a lot of bot farming and rage over mining nodes/herbs.</div></div><hr />

It is, but it was still a sizable game to come along for awhile, and whether it fails or not, Blizzard knows it can't just get by any more.<br />
<br />
There are more MMOs coming, pushing everyone, whether it is Age of Conan, WoW, Guild Wars 2, or whatever, game developers need to continue to be pushing and innovating like this in order to get us and keep us as customers.</div></div><hr />

Until a merged AH, Low pop server economy will always be terrible, there is no fixing them outside of a server merge itself, and even then that won't guarantee anything. <br />

Blizzard already gives you the option to move to a large population server with server transfers, it is yourself whom refuses to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Implied at Blizzcon, one of the lead designers stated that he wants to make Heirlooms so that they're stored in such a way that they won't need to be mailed across characters, but rather they can be clicked and 'turned on' on empty gear slots. <br />
<br />
IE, the way that account-wide pets and mounts will work, but a storage for heirlooms that all characters can access by opening a panel instead of how it works now.<br />
<br />
For that to happen, it'll need some work. But I bet it'll be out before the end of MoP once the mount and pet systems work ok.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of what the intention of low level zones has been in the past, they've evolved (and have even been designed quest-wise in most places) as rather solitary singleplayer areas. People expect, and some have even grown to like, that quieter atmosphere. It's useful for farmers, rare mob hunters, roleplayers, and just those that prefer getting away from other players for a while.<br />
<br />
It's a great feature, but by making it always-on it's going to alienate a bunch of people.<br />
If you want a single player expirience, play a single player.<br />

<br />
The sub number count released the other day wasn't done to play lip service to idiots like you who aren't willing to believe them even if you were shown screenshots monitoring server activity. <br />
<br />
Activision wouldn't lie about their sub numbers in an earnings call. It's tremendously against their best interests to lie to their investors, EVER. They couldn't care less about what you think, or what your uninformed opinion is. They have the data. You don't.</div></div><hr />

Fortunately I'm not on a low pop realm, but I can understand him.<br />
I have all ten classes at level 80+ (6 at 85) and I'd never pay Blizzard 200 € to fix something that's their responsibility.<br />
Nor would I want to level all these characters again.<br />
Eventually they'll have to do something about those low pop servers or it will come bite them.</div></div><hr />

I never needed to group with anyone to complete any quests, I could que from anywhere in the world for a dungeon or PVP. I leveled a Draenei on Kalimdor going through the human starter questing areas, eventually getting up to level 58 without really running into another player. It wasn't until I hit level 74 that I came across another player from my faction, we grouped up to complete a quest he/she was having trouble with, qued for a few dungeons, and added each other to our friends list in case we should be leveling again at the same time.<br />
<br />
The point I'm trying to make, is that for new players, the game feels very lifeless. Unless you have a massive amount of money, or want to spend your time farming instead of playing, professions are inaccessible to new players. 30-40g per stack of low level herb/ore is completely unobtainable to a fresh player without an 85 to bank roll them. They will make almost zero connections in game, when I first started playing WoW the people who I wound up being guilded with were often the people who I grouped with for harder quests and zones, and eventually found people who I shared a demeanor with and went on to raid with them.<br />
<br />
Anything that promotes more people being out in more parts of the game is a good thing. Make it accessible, populate it well, and get the community to become engaged again and take it back from the trolls!</div></div><hr />

This was a feature implemented with Cataclysm. All overhauled quests in Eastern Kingdoms/Kalimdor + the Cata quest zones had named quest mobs 'untaggable'. For example, the giant Ettin that patrols around Tol Barad could give credit to all who attack it.</div></div><hr />

so instead of 10s or 100s getting started on an expansion, trying to do quests, etc. you can have 1000s or 10000s or more trying for the same quest resources, etc. world's weren't set up to run with millions, so, no, bad idea.</div></div><hr />
