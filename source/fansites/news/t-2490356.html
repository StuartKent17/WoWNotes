As people have noticed, a few changes on PTR, mainly intended to respond to concerns about the level 100 row:<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost Strike (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/49143-frost-strike) damage increased 15%<br />
Breath of Sindragosa (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/152279-breath-of-sindragosa) damage reduced 10%<br />
Icecap (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/207126-icecap) reduces Pillar of Frost (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/51271-pillar-of-frost) cooldown by 3 seconds (from 1 second)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is still a net buff to Breath in the patch, due to the addition of the 4 Runes. But the damage buff to Frost Strike primarily improves the other two talents. Icecap/Icy Citadel builds should also be a good bit more competitive.<br />

<br />
Patch 8.2 PTR - Arms Warrior Changes<br />
A few changes that don’t appear to have made it into this PTR pull are:<br />
<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/12294-mortal-strike), Execute (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/163201-execute), Slam (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/1464-slam), and Rend (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/772-rend) damage increased 6%<br />
Deep Wounds (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/262304-deep-wounds) damage increased 12%<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty straightforward–the Deep Wounds buff is largest to boost the value of Mastery somewhat.</div></div><hr />

You don't have ANY alts? 1 char for 15 years is crazy! Kinda applaud you for your dedication but damn, I'd be so bored playing the same character day in and day out.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? Do some tests on ptr and you'll see frost mage is op with their new essences stuff. The nerf was needed.</div></div><hr />

You know this is the PTR, where there are a lot of changes and shifts in power already, right? So seeing &quot;12% increase&quot; does not mean &quot;exactly as is on live, but plus 12% more damage&quot;. Stop bitching.<br />

That's a lot of foresight you have there. I especially enjoy all the reasoning and logic you have behind every single claim.<br />

I would love it if blizzard eventually came up with a different mastery for Arms. I don't think the previous one was much better, but packing power into a bleed like this is boring and doesn't fit the &quot;arms&quot; fantasy imo.</div></div><hr />

you're a fool if you think thats true. Classic is on a massive hype train at the moment. it will crash after launch though. Not everyone has a shit opinion like yourself.</div></div><hr />

Of course it'll crash, a bumper tap, but it's not going to completely derail like BfA did ^ - ^!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the most likely scenario: Will surge within the first month or so, everyone plays like they did 15yrs ago.....then they get bored, some realize it was nostalgia, some realize they dont have time for that game anymore, etc and it comes crashing down. Will probably end up at absolute max 300k players, more realistically, 150k. <br />
<br />
And one thing people dont talk about Classic is that most will confuse a &quot;sense of community&quot; when leveling because theyre all starting at the same time. If you have a ton of people around you the game of course will be different. It would be the same right now if Live was given server restarts. But if you start a few months after launch when most people are or are reaching max level, the leveling zones will be mostly dead.</div></div><hr />

This. This. This. <br />
<br />
I hope Classic succeeds. Their success is directly going to help retail. But anyone who thinks 40-man raids are going to be sustainable in 2019 is delusional. Classic Guilds WILL implode eventually. Fun times to be had, pvp will be fun, but once everyone is max is gonna be capital city afk with the world empty, just like retail.</div></div><hr />

All specs? MM and Frost mages are doing fine. They aren't number 1 (because lets face it, that's what people really want) but they more than hold their own weight. BM starts to fall off the higher you go, but is still middle of the pack at worst. Arms and Frost DK have been scraping the bottom of the barrel the entire tier, so yes buffs for them. Not to mention this is PTR news, so it is basically irrelevant because there are huge power swings happening with all the essence adjustments. Not something to start throwing tantrums about.</div></div><hr />
