<br />
This week on Azeroth Choppers, we find Paul Jr.’s crew stressed over an upcoming visit with Team Horde and Team Alliance to go over their bikes so far. Luckily, a surprise from Blizzard HQ may provide the inspiration the teams need to get things rolling again. <br />

<br />
The Mechano-Hog and Mekgineer's Chopper are already based off of real life bikes, this is just making a web series up until we get another bike. The only thing that can be &quot;stupid&quot; is the fake drama they decided to do.</div></div><hr />

So we see the gas tank cover being sawed into a second section, some fenders and spikes... and watching them play WoW for a few minutes. And seriously, how can that guy NOT pick his talents before going into a dungeon / PvP? Come on...</div></div><hr />

Haha Exactly! Although you forgot to add &quot;A show that does NOT affect the game at all&quot; and &quot;This game is going down and Blizzard is greedy GG&quot;. More typical comments from the negative nancies</div></div><hr />

Why are people still bringing up Jersey Shore when it has nothing to do with what's being perceived as a massive waste of Blizzard resources?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because people are somehow not allowed to think something is bad. If something is bad, they are told to refrain from giving their opinion and to instead &quot;don't watch it if you don't like it.&quot;. I see none of those &quot;don't watch it if you don't like it.&quot; people defending Jersey Shore the same way.<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;don't watch it if you don't like it&quot; argument is pathetic and weak anyway. Criticism is criticism. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a difference between constructive criticism and just plain hatred comments which are the ones that tend to get made fun of. No one said they are not allowed to think something is bad but if they make a foolish comment, as many people have seen, then they either get ignored or made fun of due to the fact that they make comments like &quot;Blizzard is greedy, stop this show already GG you fail&quot; or &quot;I hate watching this and I am not liking it. That's it I am canceling my subscription&quot;. Those are the hilarious ones.<br />
<br />
Don't watch it if you don't like it is common sense dude, you can perceive it however you would like but, deal with it.</div></div><hr />

THIS.<br />
<br />
THIS is the problem.<br />
<br />
If it was a 30 min show each episode, we can have 20 minutes of bike building, 5 of adverts and 5 of bullshit drama, then it might actually be interesting.<br />
<br />
Though, this isn't exactly a real tv show, its a webcast, short and completely about advertising, that is the single reason for this show, not entertainment, who cares what they show/do really, people take it way too serious, that said, yes the drama is dumb, clearly they have directors used to filming that style, more than likely the same people who did OCC.</div></div><hr />

On-topic: If any of you ever actually watched any of the 'American Choppers' type shows, you know deadlines and pressure to hurry up and make miracles are the only thing that moves along the story. Otherwise, you could just make a slideshow of pictures as a time-lapse of parts being crafted and bolted together with the last shot being the finished product.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2014-05-08, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My only problem with the show is that it's too short, which screws up the scripted reality TV pressure and makes it hard to deal with. You could recut the first three episodes into a pretty good 22 minute show if you edited out some of the fake tension building.</div></div><hr />

The whole &quot;don't watch it if you don't like it&quot; argument is pathetic and weak anyway. Criticism is criticism. Deal with it.<br />

I think that argument is very valid. This is not the first episode. If you hated the first one, then most people wouldn't watch the second.

And I can do without the recap at the beginning of each episode too. I do think Blizzard had a good idea with the bikes, but the execution of the idea is tedious to watch.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't take anytime, but its a waste of what time it took and a complete waste of all the money spent on it.

This is probably the most embarrassing thing and terrible thing blizz has done as a company. This will be a running joke for the rest of the companies lives. Like parachute pants in the 80s.<br />

Sorry buddy but the way you perceive this show is subjective. I, for one, love watching this and it's cheap entertainment that costs me nothing extra in order to stay tuned. With the success that Blizzard has, I don't think it actually matters if people view it as &quot;waste of time&quot; and call it &quot;an embarrassing and terrible thing&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it's called Blizzard Entertainment... not Blizzard Games. They are here to entertain in one form or another and if you feel it's a waste of time then why comment?</div></div><hr />

It's also called Blizzard, but what they're doing has nothing to do with actual blizzards. The fact that they're called Blizzard *Entertainment* has nothing to do with what they do. They're a video game developer, and that's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If so then yes; the WoW community talks so much shit to Blizzard that its about time Blizzard gave them a small dose of their own medicine.<br />
<br />
It's called &quot;Feedback&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's all a part of doing business. <br />
<br />
Not all of it is positive. (Which is good because positive feedback is the most useless thing that exists.)</div></div><hr />

So basically you are saying they are not allowed to do anything else other than video games. Mhm, sounds legit. Well, going to be watching the next episode and can't wait for the release of the Warcraft movie.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, people can be interested in both WoD and in the show too you know. Although that might be hard for you to process but hey, miracles happen right?<br />
<br />
what miracles are u talking about?!yeah..maybe garrosh will ride the new bike with sun glasses or something? or they will anounce warcraft IV?!<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
i think the bikes is a little self buisenes...they dont have to show us how they are working on them..they could just anounce us the new bike with some screenshot and hey! we are giving u a new mount...but no! they are showing us the whole process...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auberdeen</div><div class="date">2014-05-09, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this series is straight up shit. Its like Fast n' Loud but TERRIBLE. this had so much potential too! No one gives a shit about &quot;the missing flux&quot; or the drama going into having to cut the gas tank. All we care about is metal, torque, bad ass designs and maximal facetime of Metzen talking because he is a god. I get it, there are more episodes to come. REDESIGN THE VIDEO PRODUCTION. its PETTY and LAME AS F*** and a shitty drama!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that a subtle way of saying that the choppers never will get done because the series only has 8 episodes? (Atleast on the website) http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/choppers/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This series was in the can months ago, how can you even... ugh, nevermind.<br />
