Warcraft Movie - Box Office Update<br />
The Warcraft Movie has done fairly well internationally (http://deadline.com/2016/06/finding-dory-warcraft-china-conjuring-me-before-you-x-men-apocalypse-international-box-office-weekend-results-1201775198/), with some claiming it has done too well in China (http://chinafilminsider.com/china-box-office-warcraft-ticket-sales-come-scrutiny/):<br />
<br />
<br />
China is now up to $205M.<br />
The international total is $340M and worldwide total is $378.9M.<br />
The movie was #1 in China for 12 days<br />
There were claims of fraud on Chinese social media:<br />
<br />
82 of the top 100 grossing cinemas on Saturday belong to Wanda, far above the usual 40 that usually are on the list.<br />
One Chinese theater saw ticket sales increase 406% from Friday.<br />
Another Chinese theater had a very high number of average moviegoers per screen for being in a city that is flooded. <br />
Dalian Wanda claims that numbers were high due to the promotion that brought more people to the malls and the numbers are correct. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
So just to make sure I'm reading this correctly - Arcway and Court of Stars are going to be Mythic-only from launch?<br />
Yep. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742908523332304896))<br />
<br />
Some players don't have the skills for Mythic dungeons.<br />
Honestly if you have the skills for Heroic and 4 people to join you, Mythic is also for you. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742912043301228544))<br />
Adding multiple levels of Mythic, only to make the first a brick wall, would defeat the purpose. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742912464086405121))<br />
<br />
I mean WOD Mythic pre-mades gives me a bad taste for this.<br />
Understandable - efficiency-minded folks running familiar content for a completion reward can make for an unfriendly crowd. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/742950243243806722))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
with conquest being removed as a currency will players still receive the Conquest to Gold conversion at the end of this season<br />
Yes, you will still receive gold for conquest and honor at the end of this season. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/743223992090169344))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
you heavily suggested to players how they should have their professions set up. I agree, for mains. For alts, it's not so simple<br />
Sorry it came across that way. Double-crafting is absolutely a viable path that offers some advantages. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/743571892716482560))<br />
Again, not to be rude, but just wanted to point out this is one of the many varied ways players choose to play. If you really<br />
But even if 2x-crafting has advantages, you should still have a bit of gatherer-envy; if not, gathering is probably undervalued. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/743572159964995586))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Do you think storyline conclusions should be raid-exclusive in a situation where raiding is hard?<br />
It never bothered me. Maybe the compromise should be some stories but not every story? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400094914285568))<br />
The conclusion to the Arthas story e.g. is a big deal, years in the making, so should be for all? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400303576711173))<br />
But also weird when an epic boss in a quest or dungeon feels weaker than a less well known raid boss. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/742400481939447808))<br />

Legion Collector's Edition Box Art<br />
Two different versions of box art for the Collector's edition have shown up recently. The one on the left shows up on Best Buy and some Amazon regions while the version on the right shows up on some EU retailer sites. <br />
<br />
The Collector's edition has been available for pre-order on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017MRX6CW/ref=as_li_tl?tag=mmochamp-20&amp;ie=UTF8) for a while now, with a 20% discount for Prime members. <br />

Warcraft Twitch Badges<br />
Twitch had an event that allowed you to show an Alliance or Horde badge in chat (http://warcraftontwitch.tv/) around the time of the Warcraft movie release. We looked at the faction balance of these badges in chat on the Warcraft channel during the movie premiere and other top streamers during the week.<br />
<br />
Most chats had around 30-50% of people that talked with no badge and they were excluded from these results. <br />

I hope that SnD is just as viable as the other talents in that tier because I am not a fan of the RNG of roll the bones, but it is something I can easily deal with.

WTF you mean??? ofcurse it make sense there is a whole pre expation event when the legion invade Azeroth, so probabbly that scene was just a quest explaing why they move Dalaran, bc it was been attack by Legion forces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, been a case since 2004. By that logic, every cutscene in the game is irrelevant since you can do it again infinite times.<br />

He rambles, digresses, and rants incessantly about alpha (of all things) with a constant infusion of his own confused, homebrewed hyper-dweeb vernacular-slang. None of it makes sense, even to him.

Maybe not stellar in the US, but the US is neither the only, nor indeed the biggest movie market now.<br />

Otherwise it's done great everywhere else, especially in the now largest market, China, where it's done brilliantly.</div></div><hr />

Of course it did well in China. I mean people are so hyped they're actually showing up in a flood and watching the movie underwater. That's dedication.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the beginning of Legion Dalaran is actually floating over Karazhan, recharging from a partial jump from Northrend to, I assume, occupy a location closer to Stormwind. The Legion forces show up to assault it and the Council of Six (minus Jaina, who got booted for still holding to the faction war in the face of planetary bombardment) decide to blink to Broken Shore to hunt for the Pillars of Creation, as a tome authored by Alodi points to them as being able to close the Legion's primary portal at the heart of the Tomb of Sargeras.</div></div><hr />

Cause as you play through expansions you jump in time essentially. Hence why you can goto NR and see that Arthas is alive still....</div></div><hr />

They point out China because it broke records there. The total box office shown is for all markets including U. S. And, quite frankly, the critics shot it down here in the U. S. They wouldn't even say the cgi magic was good, or the Orcs. They had nothing whatsoever good to say about it. It almost looked as if they were in a contest to see who could trash it the most. Some hidden prize there perhaps.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately Preach takes forever to put out his overview videos and we probably won't see all of them completed before launch. Which is sad because he's far more interesting to listen to than some neckbeard with a mound of MLP toys behind him.<br />

The movie had practically no appeal to any market outside of China, which is why those are the only number being announced. To make it look somewhat successful.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. It did well to start with in markets such as Russia and Germany. It's just that those markets are small compared to China.<br />

You dont understand why people would avoid a movie that looks like shit and is getting poor reviews? If I am gong to drop 20 bucks to see a movie at a theater, it will be one I am highly confident I will enjoy, not one I think is b-rate at best.<br />
<br />
Why wouldn't I? Because it looks bad and I got better things to go see. Not even very complicated.</div></div><hr />

It was a generic fantasy film and if anything the humans ruined it, the actors were terrible, the redeeming quality of the movie was the orcs, and their story, the motion capture used was phenomenal and the orcs looked amazing. Other than that I could have just watched the orcs part and skipped all the human bullshit, I like travis, but he doesnt suit lothar, the kings actor was terrible, khadgar was the only human I liked really. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also not hating on the success or anything but the china numbers are almost guaranteed fake lol, one of the theaters showed increased amounts of sales even though the place was under water lol.</div></div><hr />

Unless the sequels are uber cheap which will just tarnish the franchise i guess this is gonna be the only warcraft movie we will ever see on the big screen which is such a shame imo</div></div><hr />

The &quot;new&quot; horde sucks.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people forget that Horde has and always will be the faction for adults. Hell, when I joined WoW in Vanilla, Blizzard had a poll on the age groups of each faction and Horde was overwhelmingly 18+, which made me join them, then later Blizzard admitted to realizing the Alliance has always been the faction children are going to flock to. It was like that then and its overwhelmingly the same now. A lot of Horde went to Alli during WoD because of the garrison and the op human racial, but they're coming back to Horde now. No one wants to play with teenagers.</div></div><hr />
