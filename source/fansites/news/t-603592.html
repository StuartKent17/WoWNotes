We're pleased to announce that along with the other companies that make up Vivendi Games, we are merging with Activision to form a new global entertainment organization called Activision Blizzard (pending shareholder and regulatory approval). Similar to our previous arrangement, Blizzard Entertainment will now operate as a division of this new organization.<br />
<br />
There will be no changes to our games, our websites, our personnel, or our day-to-day operations as a result of the deal.

I'm interested in what will change rather than what won't. This looks like a move to get more money into Blizzard. Whether they claim or want it to, this will affect Blizzard's games. Currently Blizzard's revenue is controlled equally by it's players-- we each pay $15 per month. When Blizzard goes public, fewer people (shareholders) will be in control of a larger sum of money-- people that don't care about gaming as much as making a profit (think of them as Goblins if you will!). Blizzard will now have to keep shareholders happy in addition to nine million subscribers. If you think players make a lot of demands, take a walk down Wall Street!<br />
<br />
P.S. The title of the post is not entirely correct probably because the sources don't explain it that well. WSJ (http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119661456627310928.html?mod=googlenews_wsj)has a good summary: &quot;Vivendi's existing game unit will be merged with Activision to create a new entity: Activision Blizzard.&quot; It will still be a subsidiary of Vivendi.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FISKER_Q</div><div class="date">2007-12-02, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the idea is that Vivendi Games get the Activision and Blizzard brand in their games.<br />
<br />
Right now stuff like F.E.A.R is published by Vivendi Games, when the merger is complete it'll technically be published by &quot;Activision Blizzard&quot;.<br />
<br />
This may, however, have a negative impact on both Activision and Blizzard as a brand.</div></div><hr />
