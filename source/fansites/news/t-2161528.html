PTR Development Notes - Build 23478<br />
This week marks our first major content push to the Patch 7.2 PTR. There’s a lot to dig into, so we’d like to provide some additional insight into what you will (and won’t) find in this update.<br />
<br />
Most of the Broken Shore content has been unlocked, starting with the introductory quest chain. You can pick that up just by heading to Dalaran – it’ll be automatically pushed to your quest log when you arrive. That quest will lead you to the rest of the Broken Shore content available in this build, including the new World Quests, the continuation of your Order Hall Campaign, unlocking the new 7.2 Artifact Traits, and several other things to discover around the island (such as new treasures and rare enemies).<br />
<br />
Note that, while the quest chains to unlock the new Artifact Traits aren’t fully unique to each specialization, we did make sure that none of them are repeated within a class. That means there will be a total of 7 unique chains, all of which are ready for testing in this build – 1 for tank specs, 2 for healing specs, and 4 for DPS specs. So, if you’re playing a Rogue, you’ll have a different series of quests to upgrade your Assassination, Outlaw, and Subtlety Artifacts, but one of those will be the same as what you’d experience as, say, a Fury Warrior.<br />
<br />
Also available for testing in this week’s update is a new PvP Brawl (Gravity Lapse), some updates to the reputation system that allow you to earn additional rewards past Exalted, new Order Hall upgrades to research, and additional followers to recruit.<br />
<br />
There’s a couple things related to the Broken Shore content to keep in mind while testing it on the PTR:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Legionfall faction is available, but the rewards are not yet implemented. You’ll be able to earn reputation, but there’s no quartermaster to purchase items from yet. Many of the item rewards from killing mobs or completing quests are still a work in progress. Some things might be missing their rewards entirely. The final Broken Shore zone will include a region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings to fight against the Legion’s stronghold. For the purpose of testing on the PTR (which has a much smaller number of players), we’ve reduced how much it takes to construct those buildings.<br />
<br />
Other important content that’s coming in Patch 7.2 but is not yet available for testing includes:<br />
<br />
The Broken Shore World Bosses Class Mounts Flying The Tomb of Sargeras raid and Cathedral of Eternal Night dungeon<br />
<br />
We’ll be unlocking that content for testing in future updates as 7.2 development continues. For the time being, we’re looking forward to reading your feedback on everything we’re enabling in this week’s build. Thanks, and happy testing!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 - PTR Build Deploy 1/31/2017<br />
Hey all,<br />
We're going to be bringing down the PTR realms for another new 7.2 build. No ETA on today's push but I'll ping this thread with updates if things look like they're going to take longer than usual (4-6 hours). <br />
<br />
As usual I'll leave this thread open for discussion as long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!<br />
<br />
<br />
World Boss - Nithogg<br />
Scourge of the Skies (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/42270-scourge-of-the-skies) is up this week, sending players to kill Nithogg (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/107023-nithogg)! He drops item level 860 gear and a Holy Relic (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/141519-pillaged-titan-disc). Warriors can get the Skull of Nithogg (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140658-skull-of-nithogg) hidden artifact appearance. <br />

<br />
Weekly Bonus Event - Legion Dungeons<br />
The Legion Dungeon Event is live this week!<br />
<br />
<br />
You will get one extra piece of loot from the final dungeon boss on difficulties below Mythic+.<br />
Pick up Emissary of War (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) from Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) in Dalaran to earn Cache of Nightborne Treasures (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140152-cache-of-nightborne-treasures)<br />
This quest requires you to clear 4 Mythic(+) dungeons and rewards Heroic Nighthold loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder to queue for any Legion dungeon on Normal or Heroic difficulty. Alternately, get a group of veteran dungeoneers together and travel to one of the Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Arcway<br />
Assault on Violet Hold<br />
Black Rook Hold<br />
Court of Stars<br />
Darkheart Thicket<br />
Eye of Azshara<br />
Karazhan<br />
Halls of Valor<br />
Maw of Souls<br />
Neltharion’s Lair<br />
Vault of the Wardens <br />
<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) for you. Or, if you forget to pick it up there, you can start it from within the Adventure Journal. <br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Complete 4 Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Rewards: One loot box containing a piece of gear from Heroic difficulty Nighthold. <br />
<br />
Passive bonus: The final boss in each dungeon drop additional loot on all difficulties (except Mythic Keystone difficulties). <br />
<br />
<br />

Patch 7.2 - Artifact Power<br />
Does that mean that several weapons @ rank 54 will net you even more ranks to put into 1 weapon, or is the AP somehow tied to the weapon from which it originated?<br />
The Artifact Power will be tied to the weapon from which it originated. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/795220-maxed-out-weapon-on-ap-what-to-do-with-ap/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614784157?page=3#46))</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's nearly as stupid as people that called Pandaria &quot;pandaland&quot; even though it meant they had to type more.<br />
<br />
On-topic- getting more and more keen for 7.2. Cross Faction Construction event, reminds me of the old days of Anh'qiraji War Effort.<br />
<br />
Not too bothered about there only being 7 artifact questlines. generally means they can flesh the experiences out more if they aren't having to make 38 different ones.</div></div><hr />

We got the point, our point was it is Stupid. Since what other legendaries would you be talking about in a current content setting.</div></div><hr />

Considering it's huge (as it should be) and we just got Nighthold (first tier of 2) - give it 6 months.</div></div><hr />
