A few mounts were added to the game in Patch 3.1, the most popular one is probably the Mimiron's Head (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63796). This 310% speed flying mount will most likely drop from Mimiron in Ulduar ... See the video below. <br />

Introducing the new Battle.net Account<br />
Blizzard just released the new version of their Battle.net Service (https://us.battle.net/). If the list of features sound familiar, it's probably because most of them were introduced with the Blizzard Store a few months ago. Hopefully the change means we'll see new features soon, hints of a Battle.net integration have been in the WoW files for quite some time now. <br />
We’re pleased to introduce the Battle.net account -- a brand-new way for players to manage their Blizzard Entertainment games, make online Blizzard store purchases, log in to World of Warcraft, and more using just one set of login information.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft players now have the option to create a Battle.net account, merge a World of Warcraft account (or multiple accounts) with it, and begin logging in to the game, the Armory, and the forums using their new Battle.net account login information.<br />
<br />
Merge your World of Warcraft account now - http://us.battle.net/account/creation/landing.xml (http://us.battle.net/account/creation/landing.xml)<br />
<br />
Some of the benefits of the Battle.net account include:<br />
<br />
Fewer passwords to remember. One single login lets you access World of Warcraft, the online Blizzard store, and more -- including upcoming games such as StarCraft II and Diablo III.<br />
Opt in to upcoming Blizzard Entertainment beta tests. Put yourself in the running to be invited to test upcoming games.<br />
Easy access to your classic games. Store your CD keys for classic Blizzard Entertainment titles, and then download the games whenever you wish.<br />
And more to come… We’re planning to add more features in the future, including tools to help friends communicate between games and bring players closer together.<br />
<br />
At this time, signing up is completely optional -- but if you’re interested in taking advantage of the benefits of the Battle.net account today, check out the FAQ for more information, or create an account now.<br />

PTR - Focused Argent Testing<br />
The Argent Tournament is at the north of Icecrown, this is a new quest hub created to introduce the upcoming Coliseum raid instance in Patch 3.2. <br />
We're looking for some volunteers to put in some focused testing time on the new Argent Tournament content in northern Icecrown. We're aware some of you have been diligently doing the content already throughout our many changes, and we're very thankful for that; you've helped in hammering out quite a few issues. We're interested to hear what you have to say about the current gameplay and balance. Be advised that things have changed if you started testing this early on.<br />
<br />
Moving forward, the valiant and champion NPCs are getting another balance pass, and the Ironforge and Undercity combatants in particular are getting retuned for an upcoming build.<br />
<br />
A short FAQ:<br />
What's changed from previous builds?<br />
Since the early PTR, we've changed the early aspirant training to be more comprehensive, significantly rebalanced the valiants and champions, made the mounts more accessible, and fixed a myriad of issues.<br />
<br />
How do I get to the Tournament?<br />
If you've never been, you can speak with Jean Pierre Poulain on Krasus' Landing in Dalaran to get a free flight. If you've visited before, there is a flight point out there. It's in the far northeast of Icecrown, just north of Sindragosa's Fall.<br />
<br />
What sort of feedback are you looking for?<br />
Whatever feedback you have to share. Bugs, balancing issues, clarity of purpose, overall feel, portions you particularly like or dislike, quests you find too difficult or easy, how the fights feel against NPCs or other players... let us know your thoughts on the Tournament. <br />
<br />

Blue posts<br />
We revamped Noblegarden.<br />
Not to a huge extent, but trust me when I say the days of combing the entirety of &lt;insert newbie zone here&gt; on your epic mount hoping to catch sight of one elusive egg are over.<br />
<br />
Looking at the achievements and drawing conclusions based on how rare and random the rewards were in Noblegardens past is extremely inaccurate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/15660807859-long-strange-trip-noblegarden-and-31.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/druid.jpg Druid (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
Upcoming Balance Changes<br />
Typhoon -- what we are most likely to do is add a daze effect of some kind. This is what the mage spell Blast Wave does. The daze (it's like a 50% snare) can add a little bit more time to do something before the targets get back on you, such as cast a Cyclone. We might mess with the knockback distance a little, but Typhoon is built differently from many spells, so there may be a limit in what we can do here.<br />
<br />
2P Ulduar set bonus -- we increased the Eclipse boost to 15%, which should actually grant a dps increase.<br />
<br />
We know many druids still don't like the inherent RNG that Eclipse offers. However, we like mechanics that encourage players to dynamically (meaning if they pay attention) swap which spell they are using. Balance has often had a real tunnel-vision problem of just using the same spell over and over. Even mages do that less these days with all the other procs and cooldowns they can blow at certain times. Eclipse did have some problems, particularly with the Wrath part of the talent not actually doing enough, but we believe those are in a better shape now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15859415803-vanquish-the-evilmore-moonkin-stuff.html))<br />
<br />
Upcoming Restoration Changes<br />
The Tree of Life talent currently grants bonus healing to group members and reduces the cost of your hots in tree form. We would like to change the talent to say &quot;Reduces the mana cost of all your hots and also lets you go into tree form, which grants bonus healing.&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words, you would not need to be ToL to get the cheaper hots (in PvE or PvP) so long as you had the ToL talent. In PvP, you could still use tree form when you wanted to be more tanky but your efficiency would not be so bad when in caster form.

Glyph of Living Bomb<br />
We suspect the glyph (and fire mages) would probably be overpowered if those crits on periodic damage powered Hot Streak etc. That would be a pretty big dps boost. The glyph is just supposed to let Living Bomb do more damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15859175825-glyph-of-living-bomb-clarification.html))<br />
<br />
Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15671125153-mage-we-want-an-answer.html))<br />
Why is the molten armor spirit change a nerf to pvp, solo, and anyone not in full 25man epics / raid buffs? <br />
Realistically, most mages are never going to notice a change to crit while soloing unless it was a really large number. Soloing is generally not difficult and you are generally going to defeat everything you fight within a few GCDs. For PvP it is a nerf to those mages using Molten Armor, but very few mages use Molten Armor in PvP. If we like what the Molten Armor change does, then we might consider doing something similar to other mage armors down the road. <br />
<br />
Why is spirit still significantly less valuable for us than warlocks? Why is it still better to use non spirit items except for in the few cases where the spirit item's ilevel was higher to begin with? <br />
Apples to oranges. Agility is significantly less valuable to mages than it is to rogues. Yes, I realize you don't share gear with them, but if your concern is that warlocks will end up doing more damage as a result of that Spirit on their gear, we understand the concern and we think we have it under control. <br />
<br />
Why was scorch singled out as too powerful when it is obvious there are other raid buffs just as powerful? <br />
For starters, because characters already had very high crit numbers in the first tier of content. We aren't really trying to make all buffs equal at this stage. Sunder, for example, is still a huge damage multiplier for classes that do physical damage. But buffs that feel like they do swing the pendulum too far are good things to discuss on these forums. <br />
<br />
Why do mages still have an archaic evocation tool that is risky and can virtually kill our dps like no other class has to deal with? Why can we be screwed over through rng because of this?<br />
We understand the problem with Evocate in PvE. We aren't likely to turn it into Innervate, but we would like to come up with a solution that keeps you from getting boned when you happen to take a big blast of AE damage. I will also point out that there is a skill difference here too. Good mages know when the best time is to use Evocate (say KT just did a big blast so you know it isn't happening again). Less-skilled mages hit it the second they need it without paying attention to their surroundings. <br />
<br />
Why do improved scorch and winter's chill still have no personal benefit? Why is it still a dps loss and the cost of a major glyph to make use of scorch? What is the point now that warlocks will apply the debuff with their main nuke?<br />
Selfish benefits are something we would like to add to all talents. For those we haven't done yet, it is usually because we would have to nerf the tree somewhere else to make up for the inflated damage. One of the questions we often ask ourselves is whether a class would already take that talent just because it's such a good talent for them. For example, if Battle Shout was a talent, almost every warrior would still take it even if they knew 100% that another player could provide the buff in a group. Why? Because it still grants them so much damage when solo, in BGs, etc. <br />
<br />
Why is frost still horribly lackluster in pve? Why is frostbolt still spammed and the ice lance glyph does nothing to fix this? <br />
I suspect I don't need to explain this to mages, but we can't make Ice Lance any better without making Frost even more dealy in PvP. We talked about making the glyph better, and we still might, but the problem is most PvE Frost mages take the glyphs of Frostbolt, Molten Armor and Water Elemental already, *and* inflating the glyph to something like 8x damage would make Frost mages the most insane leveling spec in the world.<br />
<br />
Ideally, yes, we would love to get Frost into PvE and Fire into PvP in a bigger way. In the grand scheme of things though, mages have Arcane, Fire and Frostfire specs doing very competitive dps with each other in PvE and Frost and possibly Arcane as viable in PvP. That's definitely an improvement over where the class has been historically, so while it is something we want to work on, it doesn't feel like a crisis. <br />
<br />
Why has it been some five ptr builds with absolutely zero attention to our concerns? I promise GC, we aren't just complaining for the sake of it, and we're not all looking for massive damage buffs. Some of us would like to see our legitimate concerns at the very least commented upon. <br />
Just understand that your concerns and our concerns are not always in perfect agreement. We like to get feedback from the community, but ultimately we don't sit down and say &quot;How can we address all these problems that the community wants us to fix?&quot; We have to do what we think is right for the game. Sometimes you are going to applaud those changes and sometimes you might not &quot;approve&quot; of the change.<br />
<br />
I try and comment on what I can, but my time on the forums is limited. I tend to comment on things that are fresh in my mind from discussions the designers are having. If I answer 5 shaman posts and no mage posts in a given week, that is probably because we are working a lot on shamans at the moment. It really just makes the forums controversial when you argue about parity in responses or when yor why you &quot;deserve&quot; to have questions answered. Hence, I ask you not to do that. <br />

4-Pieces T8 Bonus<br />
The way we want 4piece t8 for Prot paladins to work is that the Shield of Righteousness also benefits from that extra SBV. We can try to make the tooltip a little cleaner. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15660813973-4pc-t8.html))<br />

Thunderstorm<br />
Thunderstorm seems a good deal more popular (meaning actually used) than Typhoon. Shamans also had several PvP buffs this patch while balance druids lost their main talented PvP ability, the Celestial Focus stun. It's tricky to compare abilities. Sometimes it makes sense to change similar spells in all the same way, but the risk of doing that too much is that every spell feels the same.

Lol. Apparently you didn't play in BC. Both Warglaives and Thoridal were drops. Just very very low drop rates. You haven't had to MAKE a legendary since vanilla WoW. Looks like they are bringing that back though with the new mace. Very cool.</div></div><hr />

Legendary have very low droprates? Ive seen 5x warglaive drops, think every rogue in my guild had em. Yet i never saw Black bow of the Betrayer.. gues i was unlucky. Personally i dont like the amount of &quot;luck&quot; that is required to obtain something. My last VOA 10 the Black War Mammoth dropped, and some green/blue geared guy rolled highest.<br />

Gladiator mount is way more awesome :) only 50 more rating.. argh!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you have a Blizzard authenticator and more then one WoW account, when you merge your two WoW accounts with a single battle.net email the authenticator will now work for both accounts instead of just one. This happens because when you have two accounts under one bnet email after you log in with your email it gives you the choice of which account you would like to play on.

if you haven't merged your wow account you can just change the email of your new bnet account.<br />

after you do that you will be able to change the email address of your old blizzard store account to the email address you are using on your new bnet account. just log in with your blizzard store account on the battle.net website and change the email address</div></div><hr />

damn as a spriest i will now prob go from using one piece of healer tier to four pieces.<br />
gg blizz on knowing how to itemize your classes<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a 4-5 second buff you get after using the spell that is listed. For holy priests this is a complete waste of a 4 set bonus. PWS is mana costly for one thing just to get a 5 second spell power boost. And for another, if there is a Disc priest in the raid as Holy you should not be using shields anyways. This 4 set bonus is geared completely towards Disc priests. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much 240 haste actually helps shadow priests either. That is not a very large amount of haste for 4-5 seconds. 1-2 spells max at a slightly increased cast speed. <br />
<br />
It's still PTR, but the fact that they thought this was a good idea is pretty lame. There is no reason at all for a Holy priest to get the 4 set bonus other than looks. And possible best in slot, though that will be determined later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just look how skillfull he dodges the thing of: spirit gear still useless by talking about warlocks and the nerf to scorch by talking about sunder armor.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ummm he never talked about warlocks... it was in the question. The nerf to scorch was probably made because of the change made to improved shadow bolt talent for warlocks. They want affliction warlocks to spam more shadow bolts, so they had to make it worthwhile, so instead of bringing improved shadow bolt to scorch's level and risk inflating damage, they nerfed scorch to improved shadow bolts level. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember, agility is more useful to rogues than mages. What the fuck kind of argument is that supposed to be?<br />
<br />
I'm gradually losing all respect I had for GC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a sound argument. Since when is 1 stat supposed to benefit each class the same way? You are able to top damage meters without a benefit from spirit; giving you the same benefit from spirit that warlocks get would make your damage sky rocket, which would then mean nerfing most if not all your damage. Be glad you are getting some benefit from it, even if it is minimal. <br />
<br />
Why do mages still have an archaic evocation tool that is risky and can virtually kill our dps like no other class has to deal with? Why can we be screwed over through rng because of this?<br />
We understand the problem with Evocate in PvE. We aren't likely to turn it into Innervate, but we would like to come up with a solution that keeps you from getting boned when you happen to take a big blast of AE damage. I will also point out that there is a skill difference here too. Good mages know when the best time is to use Evocate (say KT just did a big blast so you know it isn't happening again). Less-skilled mages hit it the second they need it without paying attention to their surroundings.<br />
<br />
Join the club, the benefit warlocks get from spirit is double edged, more dps but warlocks take more damage from life tap. At least if your smart you can avoid damage while gaining mana, warlocks dont have that choice they take damage regardless.</div></div><hr />

sooo, i dont agree with your wording, but with the &quot;message&quot; of your post. i thought, its a german (where i and my account come from) issue with the never ending whining. <br />
is anybody here, whos not able to kill any boss in every instance because, and now read carefully, he was nerfed or his raid buddies were nerfed or theres an imbalance? i dont think so. everything is managable. every encounter is &quot;downable&quot; every pvp opponent is (ok almost every) &quot;killable&quot;. what do you want? are you whiners really that stupid, not to see any &quot;good things&quot; within that whole game? why are you whining? because you arent #1 in dmg anymore? because you dont get an &quot;omg thats real ruuuloooor epixxxx shit&quot; setbonus? why are you playing this GAME? for enjoyment?<br />
if you whiners take this GAME such sriously, i'd recommend a deep breath and a calm down, if it doesnt help, a couch doctor.<br />

This is close to being the stupidest thing I've seen on this website. I will explain to you why this is a terrible change since you seem to have no clue about Mages. Currently, glyphed Molten Armor gives 5% crit. After 3.1, without the glyph, it will require around 850 spirit to reach 5% crit; glyphed, it will require probably around 650-700. My level 80 Mage has 391 spirit. Fire Mages are highly reliant on crit to do high DPS. They're losing about 6-7% crit this patch (Scorch nerf and Molten Armor nerf). Now, in order for Molten Armor to be near as strong as it was before, I'll have to start stacking a terrible stat which gives me no benefit (except making up for a huge nerf), spirit.<br />
<br />
Basically, Mages are being punished because the people who do itemization are too lazy to make cloth items without spirit on them.</div></div><hr />

THAT ^ is close to being the stupidest thing I've seen on this website. FFS, do mages really need a PvE boost? Playing a Spriest, I fail to see why any class needs 3 raid-viable PvE DPS classes. The reason I started playing a Spriest was for raid utility, not DPS. Once they removed our raid utility, they bumped us up to a competing DPS class. No QQ here :) . Back to my point, if there are 3 cloth DPS classes, Lock, Mage, Spriest, there will always be 1 that is better than the other two, if you are looking for raw DPS mechanics. Skill and gear will always have their pull, but behind-the-scenes mechanics truly dictate the potential DPS. With a game that is always changing, the number 1 class will always be changing, as well. If you want to be number 1 at all times, you are SoL. If you dont like being a fire mage because you &quot;need&quot; spirit, fucking RE-SPEC (i.e. Frostfire); practice on a dummy, learn a new rotation, and shut up. Mages are in no way, shape, or form underpowered. Mages are not being punished - they still lead the meters in DPS if they know how to play their class and have equal gear to the other clothies around them. Just go back to playing the GAME, not whining because you may get hit with a nerf bat. Right now, DPS cloth gear w/ spirit does have priority to Locks and Spriests, due to the fact that they get much more out of it than a mage. Get over it, or roll another class so you can find something else to whine about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stupidest thing on the website, yet what GC said is STILL a valid argument. Since when is one stat supposed to be equal to all classes?? The change to improved shadow bolt makes sure you always get a 5% crit bonus is you have a warlock in your raid, just letting you know this since you dont seem to know anything about warlocks or the other changes to the other classes besides your own. Do you have any idea if it now stacks with molten armor?? If it does guess what its a buff. If it doesnt you get the 5% crit bonus regardless. Ever heard of the big picture? <br />
<br />
My warlock has 586 spirit, and I am not even trying to stack spirit. Raid buffed I have no doubt that I can break 700. Why would you want to stack spirit? Why would you even think you need to stack spirit? Sure warlocks get more from spirit then mages do, that doesnt mean we go out of our way to stack it. If I can do it without even trying why cant you? Seriously whats so hard about getting spirit, its on almost every piece of caster gear. Is 25 man Naxx something thats hard to do? Can you not just get some different gear? <br />
<br />
So one of your specs isnt as good as it used to be. Big deal. You dont like it respec, reroll, or quit. Mages are being punished? Everyone got hit with some kind of nerf or another in the patch notes. The top mage in my guild who is able to stay on par with me in dps, isnt whining like you are, no hes actually looking at the changes and preparing himself for them, thinking up new builds he can use, getting some gear he may need, etc. And despite this COLOSSAL NERF to the mage class, I am pretty sure he will still be able to keep up with an affliction specced warlock. <br />
<br />
So first mages whined about not having a use for spirit, now they have a use for spirit. You dont like it. So now you whine about having to stack spirit. Then you say this all happened because devs are to lazy to create items without spirit? Way to use logic. Or did you mean that they should just make entire sets of gear pieces just to make sure one class or build is viable. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sooo....nerf the shit outa mages.....then make us roll against spriests and locks on gear....and expect us to be happy about it.....<br />
<br />
i think the stupidest post on here wasnt quite so stupid<br />
<br />
<br />
Again thinking about only your own class. All casters are in the same boat in terms of gear, this includes healers as well. Druids and shamans that want to heal or be casters have to use cloth because leather armor doesnt have the stats cloth has. They have it worse then mages in terms of itemization. <br />
<br />
Jeez mages cry a lot.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing since the wow beta. I've been playing since UBRS was a raid instance where guilds used DKP for blue drops, where you were pro if you were in full blues, and epics were Epic. :)<br />

I know very well that Warglaives and Thori'dal were simple drops. I didn't like that. Bosses don't just happen to carry legendary items around.<br />

Something like the Thunderfury or Rhok'delar quest line is what I'm after.. Have the boss drop an item that leads you on a challenging quest where some parts have to be done in a group, and some parts have to be done solo, testing the player's abilities..<br />
<br />
(I know Rhok'delar wasn't legendary, but it was a good quest line)</div></div><hr />
