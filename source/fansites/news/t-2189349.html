After few quests you get item for free AK level research, then you can research for next right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's fine, keep vendoring. the existing ilvl upgrade items for followers cap at 850 and there are entirely new items in 7.2 for going above 850. So any follower upgrade items are completely useless and waste bag space.</div></div><hr />

If you didn't expect this after they did the same thing with Garrison Followers, that's your problem.</div></div><hr />

Just you can't farm him in M+, He is able to be farmed in normal, This is because his gear would be stupidly overpowered if you got warforged/titanforged of a M+ version, Could you imagine, a 950 Urn?... 3k Stat+ like 1800 Mastery</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that's supposed to be non-throughput and all relics that drop in raids will be for dps traits.</div></div><hr />

Not sure where you read regular mythic karazan was being removed... M+ will just not have the option for nightbane... really not hard to comprehend</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Exodar is a crashed alien spaceship. Prophet Velen is an alien and at the end of the Exodar Light's Heart quest, he ordered on of the other aliens to repair hyperspace engines, saying &quot;We're going home&quot; (meaning Argus, his home planet). This means the repair will take more than 1 patch, so that's why we can't get to Argus yet. But since Argus is supposed to be the content of 7.3 (or 7.4?), it'll probably be fixed later (or at least some other form of hyperspace travel will be used, like the Demon Hunter spaceship they stole from the evil aliens).</div></div><hr />

I watched that part of the interview, they basically say we won't be seeing that in 7.2 (which no one expected anyway), so likely to be in 7.3 (as expected).</div></div><hr />

No, but you're likely going to be on the way to getting them while you do it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah i just mixed up mythic and mythic+ to be the same thing.<br />
I don't know, i haven't had time to do mythics from all the other shit in the game. Heroic, mythic and m+ it's all the same. <br />
Just waiting till i can solo the mounts out of that place, there's not really anything else in there of interest aside from the story but that only requires one run.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You will need to unlock all of the original traits on your Artifact before you begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
This means level 35.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The Exodar has been crashed for a while, so he isn't going home anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
as they didn't use the exodar to escape argus, they used it to escape draenor.<br />
<br />
In fact they have several functional ships there since we took out ol' 'it was merely a setback'.<br />
<br />
So either they have no clue what they're talking about, or it was taken out of context....</div></div><hr />
