<br />
Patch 4.0.6 Shaman Changes<br />
Those changes were only announced in the context of warlock changes. I recognize though that the first draft of patch notes did not yet have shaman changes listed. In light of that -- and to hopefully dissuade you all from invading the warlock forum about the changes I listed there -- below you'll find the tentative shaman notes. The patch notes will likely be updated to include these changes tomorrow evening.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..shaman) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1124-Shaman-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Chain Heal’s effectiveness has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Hex now has a PvP duration of 8 seconds.<br />
Purge now dispels a single effect instead of two.<br />
Tremor Totem has been redesigned. The totem is now usable under Fear, Charm, or Sleep effects, and pulses much more rapidly, but lasts 6 seconds and has a 1-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Elemental Combat<br />
<br />
Earthquake damage has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enhancement<br />
<br />
Flametongue Weapon damage now scales from attack power instead of spell power (for Enhancement shaman only).<br />
Purge no longer has its mana cost reduced by Mental Quickness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
<br />
Cleansing Waters no longer fires its heal effect twice when a shaman removes a Magic and a Curse debuff with a single cast.<br />
Deep Healing (Mastery) has been increased to 3% per point, up from 2.5%.<br />
Greater Healing Wave mana cost has been increased by 10%; healing done has been increased by 20%.<br />
Mana Tide Totem has been redesigned. The totem no longer multiplies the Spirit of those affected by it. It instead gives a flat amount of Spirit equal to 400% of the casting shaman’s Spirit, exclusive to short-term Spirit buffs affecting the shaman when the totem is dropped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Crowd Control duration reduction<br />
Polymorph and many other CC abilities are being reduced to 8-second durations as well. I showed you the latest shaman changes coming in the next round of patch notes. It's important to note though that the next draft of the 4.0.6 patch notes to be posted are double the size of the notes currently on the home page of our website. There are many new notes for virtually every class yet to be posted. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150574/tremor-totem-and-cleansing-waters-nerfed))<br />
<br />
Vengeance Calculation<br />
The Vengeance calculation is working correctly as far as we can ascertain. Vengeance caps at a number equal to Stamina plus 10% of base health, which is lower than 10% of health. When we buffed Stamina late in Cataclysm development, we specifically did not buff Vengeance because we didn’t think tanks needed 40% additional attack power in order to maintain threat or contribute to damage done by the group. The Vengeance tooltip is a little misleading, but in this case we think that’s fine because a more technically accurate tooltip would be quite long. Astute theorycrafters will understand the difference, while most tanks won’t actually be affected by the delta. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150349/vengeance-cap-is-not-10-of-maximum-health))<br />

Glyph of Soul Swap change reverted<br />
Good thread. While you're compiling feedback about the 4.0.6 warlock changes posted thus far, I want to make mention that the Glyph of Soul Swap change is being reverted for now. We don't feel that particular change is necessary as of yet, but will continue to evaluate Soul Swap's performance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150465/an-analysis-of-future-warlock-changes))<br />
<br />
Curse of Exhaustion<br />
Also, another change not yet listed in the notes is to the default range of Curse of Exhaustion. With the movement speed reduction at 30% in 4.0.6, down from 50%, the range is being increased to 40 yards, up from 30. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150465/an-analysis-of-future-warlock-changes))<br />
<br />
Warlocks DoTs dispell<br />
In general, dispelling warlock DoTs is a little more punishing than we intended in the current PvP model. That said, there are yet still more changes not listed which are worth mentioning here:<br />
<br />
1. The reduction on the Unstable Affliction silence effect is 4 seconds, up from 3 as currently listed.<br />
<br />
2. We do think it's a little too easy to counter warlocks (and Shadow priests) with a Resto shaman's Cleansing Waters talent (as was pointed out earlier in this thread), which is being nerfed in 4.0.6 as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150465/an-analysis-of-future-warlock-changes))<br />
<br />
PvE warlock 4-piece set bonus (Fel Spark)<br />
The PvE warlock 4-piece set bonus (Fel Spark) now increases the damage done by the next 2 Fel Flame spells by 300%, rather than increasing the critical effect chance of one by 100%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150465/an-analysis-of-future-warlock-changes))<br />
<br />
PvP warlock 4-piece set bonus<br />
The PvP warlock 4-piece set bonus has been redesigned. It now reduces the cooldown of Death Coil by 30 seconds. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150465/an-analysis-of-future-warlock-changes))</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's worth casting again? but seems like blizzard is giving shaman some kind of fear ward with the new tremor totem. Stil no buff for ele shaman in pvp :mad:</div></div><hr />

Gonna have to wait and see I guess. <br />
<br />
Concerning Chain heal and Greater healing waves updates, those two spells aren't used that much anymore, at least, in heroics, chain heal updates may help a bit and the Greater healing wave one is going to help my ''oh shit button''.<br />
<br />
And finally, I don't really know the maths so I'll have to wait and see what people have to say about our Mastery upgrade, but right now 0.5% doesn't seem that much more appealing than it was before.</div></div><hr />

I believe the nerf to CC durations is ONLY PvP.<br />
<br />
The post about crowd control duration was made in response to the shaman changes which stated that Hex now has a PvP duration of 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
The reply in itself seems like a post in itself but it is not and if read that way may make it seem like a PvE nerf but it is not.</div></div><hr />

They reference a Hex change, and if you look up that says that only the PvP duration is changed.<br />

I'm curious as to the updated patch notes. Want to see if there are even more Paladin changes.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? PUNISHING? yes because dispelling 4 dots with TWO dispells is so punishing, hell why not make it dispell removes 6 dots so it's less punishing? what a massive pile of shit, first they remove my drain mana now they want to make it EASIER to dispell my dots? why not just delete affil instead and save anymore nerfs? piss take, it was too easy to dispell my dots I pretty much gave up affil for PVP now they want it easier and without drain mana, what's the point in affil now then? and curse of exhaustion gets nerfed LAWL.<br />

Can someone tell me the point of affil in PVP now? I just don't see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This royally screws all current warlock gearing and flat out nerfs all specs significantly.<br />
<br />
The clunnky ICD mechanic will be removed though, so at least we can keep it up. But theorycrafting will have to show if it will actually be worth to even hard cast Soul Fire anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They made heroics so hard that we would have to use crowd controls to be able to make it through the instance.<br />
<br />
Now they are decreasing the durations of Crowd Controls to a point of where no one will bother using the Crowd Control Abilities due to the fact that 8 seconds is usually less then half the whole rotation of all the damage per second classes out there.<br />
<br />
8 Seconds Crowd Control will result in being;<br />
<br />
5 Mobs = 3 Crowd Controllers, 1 Tank, and 1 Healer.<br />
4 Mobs = 2 Crowd Controllers, 1 Damage Dealer, 1 Tank, and 1 Healer.<br />
3 Mobs = 1 or 2 Crowd Controllers, 1 or 2 Damage Dealers, 1 Tank, and 1 Healer.<br />
2 Mobs = 1 Crowd Controller, 2 Damage Dealers, 1 Tank, 1 Healer.<br />
<br />
Now, the only way that they could possibly fix dungeon difficulties to allow an only 8 second long Crowd Control Duration, is if they nerf the dungeons so badly that we will experience Wrath of the Lich King all over again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spoiler Alert!:<br />
Next week will be the day where everyone start rushing through dungeons in less then 10 minutes again!</div></div><hr />

Now they are decreasing the durations of Crowd Controls to a point of where no one will bother using the Crowd Control Abilities due to the fact that 8 seconds is usually less then half the whole rotation of all the damage per second classes out there.<br />
<br />
8 Seconds Crowd Control will result in being;<br />
<br />
5 Mobs = 3 Crowd Controllers, 1 Tank, and 1 Healer.<br />
4 Mobs = 2 Crowd Controllers, 1 Damage Dealer, 1 Tank, and 1 Healer.<br />
3 Mobs = 1 or 2 Crowd Controllers, 1 or 2 Damage Dealers, 1 Tank, and 1 Healer.<br />
2 Mobs = 1 Crowd Controller, 2 Damage Dealers, 1 Tank, 1 Healer.<br />
<br />
Now, the only way that they could possibly fix dungeon difficulties to allow an only 8 second long Crowd Control Duration, is if they nerf the dungeons so badly that we will experience Wrath of the Lich King all over again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spoiler Alert!:<br />
Next week will be the day where everyone start rushing through dungeons in less then 10 minutes again!<br />

Polymorph and many other CC abilities are being reduced to 8-second durations as well. I showed you the latest shaman changes coming in the next round of patch notes. It's important to note though that the next draft of the 4.0.6 patch notes to be posted are double the size of the notes currently on the home page of our website. There are many new notes for virtually every class yet to be posted. (Source)<br />

I agree with you one hundred percent. Blizz said &quot;CC is making a comeback in Cata. &lt;stands proudly&gt;&quot; Then they neuter it with a 8 sec duration.

<br />
No, no, no and also no.<br />
<br />
Earthquake already hits like a truck compared to other AoE, if anything just lower the mana cost on the current version. 60% of base mana equals about 12.5k+ per cast. That's why we don't use it, not because it's weak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, this lousy cc, which is undispellable...<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
as a pvp restoration shaman myself, i like the changes. <br />
in pvp, you had to wear 2xresil trinkets, so all the procc/on use spirit trinkets were only viable in 2s.<br />
the old tremor totem was impossible to ballance: it was impossible for enemies to fear your team, but it was also nearly impossible to keep a priest/lock from smacking down your tremor right after the fear -&gt; fear imunity for the shamans team, but hard to stay unfeared as shaman (against good players with 2400+ rating).<br />
the new 1 minute cooldown is interesting, because it will be working 100% when needed, and the following fears will share dimishing returns. in addition to the insignia and/or wotf, it should be possible, to still handle fears as shaman, without an unfair advantage against locks.<br />
cleansing waters &quot;nerf&quot; is ok, too: in 2s, the talent was overpowered against every lock/healer team. in 3s, the dispell-heal was not enough to outdmg 2 damage dealers, so you had to throw in bigger heals and therefore it was impossible to clean every debuff (or eat an 5 sek silence from ua). the current change will not really affect the 2on2 problem, though.<br />
greater healing wave change is clearly a nice buff. the spell is mostly used in 2 situations: you either top someones health in a save spot without the fear off interrupts or you use it with nature grace. our biggest instant heal doesnt need to be really manaefficient, it needs to heal a lot and now it heals 20% more.<br />
<br />
the only problem i see is elemental pvp:<br />
to make elemental viable, you need either hard mage nerfs or you need to bring elemental shamans in par with mages (another op class is the least thing you would want).<br />
they share dimishign returns on important ccs, mages can do the same as elemental shamans, but better, offhealing is dead since cataclysm happened... elemental shamans are always compared to mages, who bring more atm.</div></div><hr />

Just because an ability is nerfed doesn't mean it's useless. Being able to break your group out of fear/charm/sleep effects WHILE being feared/charmed/slept is still a very powerful tool.</div></div><hr />

They specifically say they will nerf all kinds of cc ... so why is polymorph ruined when all ccs get the same nerfbat? You just cant deny that cc was WAY to powerful in current state of pvp. And mages got too much control anyways so the cc nerf is greatly justified.</div></div><hr />

YES THEY SHOULD!! Because Mages and Locks can spam it thats why, their is no cooldown. You are horrible. <br />
<br />
And you're not spending 25% of your time casting it. The amount of time it takes to cast is 100% casting time. The duration of the CC is 100% CC. You do not combine the too. This is why Frost Mages are unstoppable gods, because Blizz caves to QQ'ers like this guy. <br />
<br />
PRO TIP: Repentance last 6 secs, Cyclone is 6 sec, Sap has to be out of combat. I know you're a frost mage because your talking like a spoiled brat so you can still Deep Freeze every 30 seconds which is a shorter cooldown than Repentance or HoJ, you have NOTHING to complain about. Use Ring of LOL if your that bad.<br />
<br />
edit: never played shaman, keep forgetting it has a cd, give them instant cast and make it 6 seconds with the cooldown and shamans will still not be anywhere as near as powerful as mages are. At least im not a frost mage crying my eyes out about having to cast something that can be spammed at 30 yards no less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it's worth casting again? but seems like blizzard is giving shaman some kind of fear ward with the new tremor totem. Stil no buff for ele shaman in pvp :mad:Just my personal opinion, of course, but I still don't see EQ as a worthy 31pt talent, even after the buff.<br />
<br />
In an expansion where we have moved away from aoe dps, to single target and CC, the talent is highly situational and underwhelming at best. The mana cost is too high to warrant multiple uses until you reach higher gearing levels where your single target DPS is mana neutral/positive. Yeah, I don't see myself taking this talent on my shaman at all. I'll probably hold a secondary Elemental spec where I take this for situational fights only.</div></div><hr />

They just showed the balance nightmare created by giving every healer a magic cleanse, especially one that heals.<br />
<br />
Nerfing resto shamans is like a 30% buff to warlocks in pvp since that's the one class that kept them in check from becoming total monsters. it's also a buff to Mages since hex was pretty much the only CC that would last a full 10 second on a mage if not trinketed, IB'd or dispelled thanks to mage armor.<br />

This is fantastic for PvP, but as far for PvE where fears come more than once a minute on some boss fights Tremor Totem now moves into the vestigial totem rank.<br />
<br />
Before it was just get close to the totems before fear, now it's get close to the person who drops the totems and prey they don't suck, lag, or get feared in the opposite direction for too long before dropping tremor.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard needs to realize that PVE balancing and PVP balancing should be completely separate. Each character should have a PVP only spec, and all spells and abilities should have different effects in PVP and PVE as needed. After the initial QQ'ing about spells having different effects in PVP and PVE it would become completely transparent to players and as a result both PVE and PVP would be better balanced and more rewarding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point, they're no longer that powerful.<br />
<br />
I remember when CCs lasted 15 seconds, and your trinket was specific to your class and only worked on three types of CC. So, for example, Warlocks had zero chance to break a stun, and druids had zero chance to break fear. That's when CC was not only powerful, it was ridiculous.<br />
<br />
CC in TBC was strong. CC in Wrath was balanced (except for how quickly people died). CC in Cata is turning into a joke.<br />

This post is missing the nasty warlock nerf on Improved Soul Fire. I'm having trouble getting on the us forums atm, but Zarhym said that Imp. SF will now do a 4/8% damage buff to fire and shadow. This replaces the 15% haste it currently gives.<br />
<br />
This royally screws all current warlock gearing and flat out nerfs all specs significantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well hopefully they're able to adjust warlock damage up slightly in other ways to compensate. I'm pretty happy with this change, as long as they're also going to give some of that damage back in other ways. We'll see.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The clunnky ICD mechanic will be removed though, so at least we can keep it up. But theorycrafting will have to show if it will actually be worth to even hard cast Soul Fire anymore.<br />
<br />
It will definitely be worth casting still, but probably a low priority except when you have the Imp proc.<br />

Erm, is the Tremor totem change also only for pvp? Cause that makes it kinda useless for pve?<br />
<br />
No, it makes it great for PvE. You wait until your raid is feared, then you drop tremor to instantly break fear for the entire raid. Pretty useful.<br />

No lol<br />
<br />
its 10 sec in pvp right now. There is no pvp CC that lasts longer than 10 sec.<br />
<br />
This is correct. It was 15s in vanilla, 12s in TBC, 10s in Wrath, and now it looks like the cap will be 8s. People will still complain so in the next expansion it will be reduced to 6s.</div></div><hr />

Employee 1: Hey guys we haven't touched shamans in a while, I bet they feel we're ignoring them, we should do something<br />
<br />
Employee 2: OOO OOO I have some great ideas, lets take purge, tremor totem, mana stream totem, and... make them really bad<br />
<br />
Janitor: I dont think that's a very good idea, it's kind of just a pointless nerf to a class thats already not that grea-<br />
<br />
Employee 2: SHUT UP AND GET BACK TO WORK<br />
<br />
Employee 1: Alright but we have to compensate, lets give them a miniscule bonus to their heals since no one plays enh or ele anymore.<br />

Except when a boss fears you multiple times in the minute it takes for tremor totem to get off cooldown..........</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming this is a troll post, but hex is only being reduced to 8 secs in PvP, not PvE.</div></div><hr />

I hope this means that the need for cc in Dungeons and Raids is going away.... once again. <br />

Otherwise this is bullshit!</div></div><hr />

Invalid opinion is invalid. AoE does get used, yes even in the boss PVE fights (Magmaw for the buggies, Maloriak for the adds in Green Phase) I wish they'd buff Hurricane for boomy cause even with speccing into it for my offspec on fights that need AoE damage, it's abysmal at best.</div></div><hr />

Purge change is good. It is OP on live.<br />
Tremor Totem change is beastmode. You will be able to break fears faster in PvE, and a HUGE buff for PvP. The way it ticks has always been broken. Glad they fixed it.<br />
Mana Stream totem will be a nerf initially, but it will scale better now, ending up as a buff in later tiers.<br />
<br />
So yeah, quit ur QQ</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlocks are fine. a lot of other classes are having more issues and not nearly enough mage nerfs happening so far.</div></div><hr />
