Chill of the Throne, Tanking, and You!<br />
For Icecrown Citadel, we are implementing a spell that will affect every enemy creature in the raid. The spell, called Chill of the Throne, will allow creatures to ignore 20% of the dodge chance of their melee targets. So if a raid's main tank had 30% dodge normally, in Icecrown Citadel they will effectively have 10%.<br />
<br />
Why are we doing this?<br />
<br />
The high levels of tank avoidance players have obtained is making the incoming damage a tank DOES take more &quot;spiky&quot; than is healthy for raiding. Ideally, tanks would be receiving a relatively constant stream of damage over time. This allows healers to better plan their healing strategy, broaden their spell options, and simply give more time to react. Tanks could use their cooldowns more reactively. Instead, the current situation is that if we make a hard hitting melee boss and a tank doesn't avoid two successive swings then the tank could very well be dead in that 1-2 second window. The use of reactive defensive abilities instead becomes a methodically planned affair, healers have to spam their largest heals just in case the huge damage spike happens.<br />
<br />
We've been trying to do a fair amount to mitigate the effect of high tank avoidance on the encounter side of things during this expansion with faster melee swings, additional melee strikes, dual wielding, narrowing the normal variance of melee swing damage, and various other tricks. There's a limit to what we can do, however. So to give us a bit of breathing room weâ€™ve implemented Chill of the Throne. Going forward past Icecrown Citadel, we have plans to keep tank avoidance from growing so high again.<br />
<br />
We'll have this on the PTR soon so players can see the effects inside Icecrown Raid. <br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler also posted about that a few minutes later. <br />
<br />
Our original estimations for tank avoidance would have worked fine had we not decided to add extra tiers of gear to reward heroic boss kills halfway through the expansion.<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm design will keep tank avoidance at more manageable levels. The loss of defense skill counts for a lot right there. We are also considering giving bosses expertise or other ways of baking in Icewell Radiance -- basically the concept that bosses scale with gear rather than just hitting harder and taking more hits. <br />
<br />
It would still be fine if the itemization team had designed the gear accordingly. In a full 258 setup for warrior tanks, precisely two pieces have anything but a 3 way split of pure avoidance stats on them. There's 3 different avoidance stats on 3 different diminishing returns, and pumping them all up like that can really make avoidance numbers go way out of whack. Meanwhile, we lose out on things like Expertise, and the preciously rare Hit Rating which is available on *1* piece of 258 tanking gear and end up having to swap gear around to cover those deficiencies. <br />
You are making the common mistake in thinking that our goal for itemization is to give you the best possible gear that we can. Itemizing your character is supposed to be a choice. There will be better pieces and worse pieces. There will be pieces that combine stats your really want with stats you don't really need. Wearing the best gear for their character (which is not the same as wearing the best gear) is one way players have to demonstrate mastery of the game.<br />
<br />
This is also why I always preach to take BiS lists with a grain of salt. Merely reaching for the item declared to be BiS by a spreadsheet or system you might not even understand could lead you to making bad gear choices, often of the variety of passing over the good upgrade because it's not the best possible upgrade.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're going to give mobs expertise, can you please make a spell or some kind of method to determine the level of expertise without us having to do parses?<br />
Yes. We would probably just let you see the numbers directly. I consider it a design flaw that players have to experiment to determine thinks like hit and expertise caps. We're all for experimentation and theorycrafting, but we don't think it's fair to require some players to go out and do a lot of work to generate specific numbers that all players feel like they need to know. <br />
<br />
Putting so much avoidance on gear isn't a bad idea because other stats are better. It was a bad idea because it causes tank scaling to fail and makes Radiance necessary.<br />
That logic doesn't really work. It's like saying instead of nerfing armor pen, we should have just put less and less on higher level gear.<br />
<br />
If we had avoided avoidance on tank gear, then every piece of tank gear would have hit and expertise (and maybe crit, haste and armor pen). Stamina and armor are static amounts, and if they were not, then those pieces immediately become the only pieces players would pay attention to. <br />
<br />
If you want ICC damage to be steadier, why don't you just walk over to the item team and say &quot;Hey, we'd like less avoidance, can you cut out half of the avoidance from the ICC gear and replace it with stamina?&quot; Or if you're worried people will get too much stamina, make it Frost Resistance and put in so much Frost damage you couldn't hope to survive long with TotGC gear alone.<br />
<br />
We just don't think that works. If you put very unattractive stats on gear then players just go back the previous tier of gear and complain that we don't know how to itemize. If you put bonus stamina on the tier 10 gear, then that means the next tier of gear better have bonus stamina as well. If it has avoidance instead of that bonus stamina, tanks just shrug and go back to the tier 10 gear.<br />
<br />
This is not a tank only problem. Casters won't upgrade to gear that doesn't have more spell power on it, because spell power tends to trump everything else for purposes of their dps or healing.<br />
<br />
We put a little bonus armor on non-armor items (necks, rings, trinkets and the occasional cloak). We don't put bonus armor on gloves and chests because that gear would be too good.<br />
<br />
It's an item level problem. If we added another raid tier to Lich King, we couldn't just keep avoiding avoidance and avoid it for every tier going forward. We just need a system where you avoid a Naxx boss 30% of the time and an Icecrown boss 30% of the time, the same way the Icecrown bosses have e.g. 30% larger health bars and thus take 30% more damage to kill. Otherwise the stats don't scale and bad thing happen (in this case the boss having to land so much damage to account for the fact that it misses so often).</div></div><hr />

Oh well, atleast all classes are welcome to actually raid in ICC...&lt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
Edit: The three of my characters that I'd probably do ICC with is my druid tank, resto shaman, and my hunter.<br />
This won't affect me at all on hunter, but will be on other two chars, Jesus, seems to me like you didn't put too much thought into this because, yes, there are some feral tanks out there, and our only avoidance is through dodge, will this mean I won't be able to tank ICC the moment it comes out? Do I have to accumulate feral pieces by healing this goddamned place? Not sure how I'll be handling this on my shaman tho, because I remember Sunwell Radiance to be a total freaking biatch... GG Blizz, I personally don't think this is the best way to counter what you call too spiky damage, whaaat? With good healers this shouldn't be an issue at all, if you can't deal with some spike damage, do one of the following;<br />
1) Don't heal<br />
2) Get better at it (Today, this is basically the same as number 3 tho...)<br />
3) Get better gear (Today, this is basically the same as number 2 tho...)<br />
<br />

(Edit 2: Been thinking a bit, and I must say, this is quite a hit to me as a feral druid, but I guess this change will only turn me into a bigger meat-shield, since I know I will stop gemming for agi completely, and go for 100% stam.. GG)</div></div><hr />

Did you actually read the entire post? They aren't just nerfing avoidance and calling it a day. They're nerfing avoidance and lowering the damage per attack of the bosses so that tanks take a steady stream of damage instead of no damage for ten seconds then two seconds that'd kill them if a big heal doesn't land. It's to make healers' lives EASIER.</div></div><hr />

Oh hey, they did. It wasn't enough. Cataclysm will finally stick a nail in the too much avoidance coffin. It's impossible without 5 levels of rating decay and a total itemization revamp to fix this without an expansion. The stopgaps didn't work. They didn't want to have to do it, but they do. It'll never happen again, though, due to Cataclysm changes.</div></div><hr />

imo, this shouldnt affect frost DKs...cmon they are frost... also bears, i mean, they are fat like hell</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very happy about the &quot;steady stream&quot; change. Having a boss use an ability and then melee hit right after it is a real pain. Its a lot of fun to watch a tank get hit with Impale and get white hit and drop from 47k to 0 in .5 seconds. This change should make healing a lot more fluid rather than staring at the timer on Bigwigs and timing your heal to land exactly when the boss uses an ability.<br />

Healers should be given a big burden in the END OF THE EXPANSION content. Some believe healers have easier job than dps... I find this hard to believe, I always felt healers had the biggest responsbility in a raid, and this debuff just makes my stance firm again. Tanks will now have to re-think gear choices perhaps and maybe some tanks may feel a bit down due to their CDs or what not, but hey I'm sure Blizz will think of something, this was long awaited in current content.

It's a flat percentage decrease to dodge. Unless you have less than 20% dodge, this isn't going to reduce the value of dodge on gear at all. It also doesn't affect druids more than other tanks...if a druid had 40% total avoidance before, all dodge, and a warrior had 40% total avoidance as 25% dodge and 15% parry, the druid will now have 20%, all dodge, and the warrior will have 20%, 5% dodge and 15% parry. Adding 5% more dodge via dodge rating on gear would bring both back up from 20% to 25%. So, how is this making parry more valuable than dodge and affecting druids more than other tanks unless there are tanks out there with less than 20% dodge now (certainly not true of any even non-druid tank capable of tanking ICC)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because of the way any kind of avoidance rating works this might have been unavoidable. <br />
I think they honestly didn't want to implement this kind of effect but found it was a necessary evil. I'd rather have them institute this kind of gimmicky change than stick to their guns and throw more spiky high tank damage fights at the raid. <br />

Probably for the best, but lets see how this actually works in live.</div></div><hr />

It's a huge roulette for healers, that can do nothing but spam the tank hoping for the best.<br />

Too much avoidance isn't a good thing. Mitigation on the other hand is fine, but only half of the tanks have it.</div></div><hr />

Still, as they have explained before, with the new changes to tiered raiding ilvls got way higher than planned back in WotLK development. Consquently stats like dodge shot up to unexpected heights.<br />
<br />
Also druids will be fine. I mean they were able to tank heroics and Naxx just fine before avoidance reached the points it at now. ICC will just be a return to those kinds of avoidance numbers with bosses that hit harder (than in Naxx but less hard than they would have without Chill of the Throne).</div></div><hr />

Parry have a really rough diminishing return, stack parry as avoidance stat is probably the worst idea ever. <br />

block value isn't bad with a decent block chance. Unfortunately all the block gears are ulduar level, you aren't gonna get very far with a 35k hp tank. (gimmick fight is gimmick fight)</div></div><hr />

My current EH gear puts me around 40k health, unbuffed, with around 1500 block value. My pure-block set puts me at 3.5k sustained BV, but sacrifices quite a bit of health (though some re-gemming could fix that).<br />
<br />
If we're eyeing raw, 15k hits and I can cut that down to 12 to 11k with block, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw block becoming somewhat valuable, akin to the lighter Ulduar fights.</div></div><hr />

The idea here is that rather than having long periods of time with 0 damage followed by short bursts of massive damage averaging out to, say, 5000 DTPS, you're looking at a much more consistent and flat damage line that averages out to 5000 DTPS.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">2009-10-29, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple people mentioned just having the boss attack faster but do less damage, the problem with that is it trivializes content. First it makes block overpowered due to current block mechanics. Second if the boss is throwing out the same dps, but 2 or 4 times as fast attack speed, its mathematically the same in the long run, but its the short term that really matters. I'll throw out some &quot;round&quot; numbers for easy math.<br />
<br />
Tank health 52k.<br />
Tank avoidance 60%<br />
Boss damage 12.5k dps, 2 sec swing= 25k hits every 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
Basically with no heals it takes 3 hits in a row to kill you. 4 seconds from time of first hit.<br />
<br />
You have a 40% chance to get hit once.<br />
16% chance to take 2 in a row.<br />
6.4% chance to take 3 in a row.<br />
<br />
Boss damage 12.5k dps 1 sec swing 12.5k hit every second.<br />
No heals = 5 hits to die. 4 seconds from first hit.<br />
<br />
You have a 40% chance to get hit once.<br />
16% chance to take 2 in a row.<br />
6.4% chance to take 3 in a row.<br />
2.56%chance to take 4 in a row.<br />
1.024% chance to take 5 in a row.<br />
<br />
Both setups &quot;worst case&quot; you die in 4 seconds. However in the first scenario you're over 6 times more likely to hit that worst case scenario, than you are with the lower damage faster swings. And we all know its not the long term average damage that kills a tank, its the burst.</div></div><hr />

Or not. So yes, the 20% is the same for everyone. But once a warrior or paladin realizes that their mitigation just dropped 20%, they have the option to switch to a parry or block heavy set and offset some of the penalty. What do druids do? &quot;Oh you have savage defense, you have &quot;block&quot;&quot;. So we stack gear that raises our crit to have the highest possible savage defense uptime... which is... the same gear we already wear for dodge... AGI gear. Druids have no real alternate option to adjust and mitigate some of this nerf. <br />
<br />
Someone suggested switching to stam stacking, but that is most likely at the cost of more AGI for druids which just switches mitigation for effective health. We can't get a good tradeoff anywhere.<br />
<br />
If I'm a warrior or paladin, I'm stacking parry/block and pushing my dodge under 20% if I can, so the effect of the nerf to my mitigation is as minimal as possible. Maybe there isn't the gear out there to push dodge that low by stacking parry/block and this point is moot (I'm not a pally or warrior, so I wouldn't know). My guess is there are pieces out there for parry/block sets in almost every slot though.</div></div><hr />

It's an understandable way of looking at it, BUT, they shouldn't have had to do it in the first place imo. If they can't use maths and sheets to find out the direction that their stats are building up, or even be bothered doing internal testing and future QAs then they're doing their job wrong. Sunwell Radiance 2.0 is NOT a well thought out. It's some idiot that couldn't plan ahead, and has no idea how to fix it besides doing the same dumb thing they did before.</div></div><hr />

They'll have to do more than just speed up boss attacks in ICC when accounting for the &quot;Icecrown Radiance.&quot; If you factor that into the original example:<br />
<br />
You have a 60% chance to get hit once.<br />
36% chance to take 2 in a row.<br />
21.6% chance to take 3 in a row.<br />
13.0% chance to take 4 in a row.<br />
7.8% chance to take 5 in a row.<br />
<br />
Without some adjustment to boss damage, you actually have a greater chance of dying than in either of the original scenarios.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay so I used the wrong word, sue me. The point still stands. Let's take the example from the post all these people saying it's totally fair are worshiping.<br />
<br />
<br />
...if a druid had 40% total avoidance before, all dodge, and a warrior had 40% total avoidance as 25% dodge and 15% parry, the druid will now have 20%, all dodge, and the warrior will have 20%, 5% dodge and 15% parry... <br />
<br />
My point is, if I'm this warrior I change my gear around so I'm at 15% dodge, and 25% parry before I go into ICC. The druid has no option on his gear but to switch dodge out for stam, but he's never going to get below 20% dodge, even stam stacking. Now both of these characters go into ICC. The druid will now have 20%, all dodge, and the warrior will have 25%, all parry. The druid gets a bigger nerf in this example.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xendrie</div><div class="date">2009-10-29, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure it will work out fine. as they said they ain't just slapping on a dodge reduce like they did in sunwell, they scale the bosses after it.<br />
<br />
however what I'm concerned about is what some people already stated, Dk's threat. Rune strike is a big part of building threat as a dk and removing 20% of my dodge will in the end affect rune strike big time. I have tanked since wotlk release on my dk and for every patch that comes it feels like my threat gets lower and lower cus of nerfs that has mostly been directed at pvp dps or pve dps, but also hits us dk tanks since we don't got a specific tree like other classes. and while people get more gear to optimize their dps output effectively increasing their threat at the same time, while my threat as mostly scaled from a weapon change not so much from gear. and i can say its a lot harder now to stay above some classes in threat but not impossible (this ofc depends bossfights). I'm looking forward to how this will affect us, and what they will do if this becomes a problem.<br />
<br />
also the stamina trinkets that was data mined not long ago, 24/27 stamina each stack, 10 stacks, 10sec duration and gets renewed every time i dodge. how is this gonna work out with 10% dodge?</div></div><hr />

No you're not. Parry suffers much more harshly from DR than dodge does. The way that paladins and warrior achieve appropriate level of avoidance is by balancing the two. IF there were a way to gear (in content appropriate gear) that would SOMEHOW drop your dodge below 20%, your parry would be so far into DR that it wouldn't help. That being said, you can't (in content appropriate gear) be ready for icecrown and have less that 20% dodge.<br />

Yeah like I said, if there is no viable gear scenario where other tank classes can push their dodge low enough, then it would be a moot point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's be honest though. The reason this kinda silly juggling is going on is Blizz has 3 types(possibly 4) of tanking. Trying the balance them against each other and more importantly the raid bosses is the issue. It's easy for a given boss to be cake for one tank and impossible for another.<br />
<br />
The blame here rests solely on Blizz not the players. It's human nature to find the best/easiest way to tackle a given challenge. Players got clever and now Blizz has painted themselves into a corner. Sadly they have decided the solution is to tear the wall behind them down in order to get out of said corner.</div></div><hr />

Look at my last paragraph of my original post and check out all the &quot;if's&quot; and the &quot;maybe&quot;. If it isn't possible to shift gear in such a way to do that, then it doesn't matter. You just said &quot;like its easy&quot;, I also never said it would be easy. But if there is a viable gear scenario where it was possible, then the nerf could be less for some tanks than others. I didn't make any numbers up except for quoting a previous example that was just as made up. You want to bark at my random numbers for the sake of arguement than bark at his too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really sure how you can say this is going to make a healers job harder?<br />
Concider what GC just said:<br />
&quot;the only way we could balance the increases in avoidance was to make bosses hit alot harder to make up for all the misses.&quot;<br />
<br />
So basically you'd be healing.... oh look the tank is topped off, and I just took some damage and so did this other guy who is tanking adds, looks like they could use a heal, I'll help them out. Wow what happened to the tanks hp? he's 30% after only getting hit one time! Oh crap I cant heal because I just used a global on a riptide and still have 1.5s to wait, the mob is going to swing in another 2 seconds, so by the time my global is finished and I start my next cast (+ latency) the tank will more then likely be dead, or the tank will have to blow some sort of cooldown that would've made the next stage much easier, or will make the enrage phase now impossible. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
In regards to being a druid tank and a druid healer I find I usually have more dodge than other tanks where I may go down to 30% dodge from this aura another tank will go down to 5%. We have more armor than the other tanks and we have our pseudo block. <br />
<br />
As far as other classes switching to stack block/parry I am sure by the time you got yourself down to less than 20% dodge and increased parry and block diminishing returns would come into play very heavily and you would be better off with the dodge even with the 20% reduction.<br />

They did, and then people screamed for 25m heroic mode which obviously had to supply better gear.<br />
People have predicted the rise in Ilvl's being to fast since naxx, and they acknowledge the problem, but there was no way to stop with the path already taken.<br />
Ulduar/ToC hardmodes without higher Ilvl gear would have made the forums implode.<br />

This is a quick fix till the issue completely gets resolved in Cataclysm, and tbh, they did do a fairly good job.</div></div><hr />

Are you really that dumb? You said bosses don't hit for 35k-40k Gormok does (his standard melee alone). His impale is another 20k. The fact is with this change the next tier won't have bosses hitting for 40k and destroying your tanks in .5seconds because of an instant attack + melee.</div></div><hr />

The point still stands. Let's take the example from the post all these people saying it's totally fair are worshiping.<br />
<br />
My point is, if I'm this warrior I change my gear around so I'm at 15% dodge, and 25% parry before I go into ICC. The druid has no option on his gear but to switch dodge out for stam, but he's never going to get below 20% dodge, even stam stacking. Now both of these characters go into ICC. The druid will now have 20%, all dodge, and the warrior will have 25%, all parry. The druid gets a bigger nerf in this example.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is betting that it just isn't feasible to drop your dodge below 20% without seriously gimping your stats. If it is shown to be feasible, they will probably just tack on an additional penalty for zeroing out your dodge. For example they could increase your chance to be crit if your dodge is too low.</div></div><hr />

Ya every fight is going to be a tank and spank! There will be no movement or mechanics that will need to be worked around in order to kill an ICC boss. Nope, not any! <br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Did you ever stop to think that maybe this change will give Blizzard more time to focus on making unique and challenging fight mechanics? ICC would have to be dulled down because boss mechanics would make healing too hard due to the new RNG style of tanks taking massive hits from bosses that are balanced around the inflated avoidance levels of tanks.<br />

I feel bad for druid tanks everywhere, but to be truthful, this was basically inevitable. I can't think of any other meaningful solution to the problem, and while everybody is going QQ BLIZZ SUCKS Y DEY DO DIS, think about it. You don't think they've been likely agonizing in development meetings about some solution, and then slowly drawing towards the conclusion that this is the only unfortunate way to bandaid the situation? Tank avoidance is just too high, meaning spike damage is just way way too high. <br />
Any tank on ToGC knows this.<br />
The reason a raid fails in ToGC should be because they didn't switch targets quickly enough, they weren't picking up/removing buffs/debuffs fast enough, they weren't positioning themselves or DPS wasn't uber enough. Not because the tank randomly takes a giant-ass hit out of left field, despite being almost full-258 geared.<br />
<br />
This will all go away when Cataclysm hits, and this is the sad, but seemingly only fix to bridge the gap on a problem that's been slowly building up for the entire expansion. That said, god damn, I feel bad for druids. ):</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll give an example of the current situation on a boss such as Gormok. Let's say Tank is a Death Knight that has 50k hp raid buffed, decent avoidance, and he has Healer A and Healer B healing him. Let's also say both healers are paladins.<br />
<br />
[0:0:01] Gormok the Impaler's Melee dodged.<br />
[0:0:04] Gormok the Impaler's Melee parried.<br />
[0:0:05] Gormok the Impaler's Impale hits Tank for 24000.<br />
[0:0:06] Healer A's Holy Light heals Tank for 17000.<br />
[0:0:07] Healer B's Holy Shock heals Tank for 7000.<br />
[0:0:08] Gormok the Impaler's Melee dodged.<br />
[0:0:08] Gormok the Impaler's Impale (DoT) hits Tank for 2500.<br />
[0:0:10] Healer A's Flash of Light heals Tank for 4000 (1500 Overheal).<br />
[0:0:11] Gormok the Impaler's Melee missed.<br />
[0:0:11] Gormok the Impaler's Impale (DoT) hits Tank for 2500.<br />
[0:0:13] Healer B's Flash of Light heals Tank for 5000 (2500 Overheal).<br />
[0:0:14] Gormok the Impaler's Impale hits Tank for 25000.<br />
[0:0:14] Gormok the Impaler's Melee hits Tank for 20000.<br />
[0:0:14] Gormok the Impaler's Impale (DoT) hits Tank for 5000.<br />
[0:0:15] Tank dies.<br />
<br />
Now you can see where the spike really takes place. Lower avoidance from Chill of the Throne will mean bosses have to hit for less, which means less spike. Less spike also means one second of bad luck doesn't completely screw over the entire raid.</div></div><hr />

After being told that things shouldn't be designed around watching a threat meter, that's what you will be doing with a DK tanking ICC.<br />
<br />
I am a bear tank, and I have no issues with this change.<br />
<br />
20% = 20% if you're a bear, warrior, dk, or pally.<br />
<br />
DR on parry is teh suck, good luck trying to push your dodge below 20% and stack parry.<br />
<br />
If my avoidance is already lower than you overall and I lose 20%, that hurts everyone else more.<br />
<br />
Using the fail logic of trying to dump all your dodge and stack something else for non-bears, wouldn't I then drop all my agi gems, dodge talents, etc and go pure stam? Which I'd mention would also scale better for me as I'd be stacking stam without the DR of parry.<br />

This. Besides, what they're concerned about is the need to increase tank damage to make up for high avoidance. Nerfing healing might help that, but it would punish the rest of the raid who need healing too. This just nerfs the one aspect they were targeting.</div></div><hr />

As for DKs and their rune strikes, it'll be interesting to see if/how they address it without buffing the hell out of runestrike if used outside of ICC.<br />
<br />
Also, tanks need these inflated stats due to retards and lazies in LFG and Trade chat. &quot;LF1M TANK FOR HEROIC FARMING. MUST HAVE 80K HP UNBUFFED AND 90% AVOIDANCE OR DON'T BOTHER WHISPERING, YOU SCRUBS!!&quot;. Ok, I exaggerated a little bit, but I have both a DK tank and a bear tank and people's expectations of my stats are becoming rather silly. I actually had someone laugh at my DK and say, &quot;HAHA, YOU CAN'T TANK HEROICS WITH ONLY 32K HP!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I blame Brewfest Trinkets for this, at least in part. New tanks were able to pick up 2 170 stam trinkets immediately, putting them very quickly into the 30k+ category. The definition of noob changed accordingly, and for the truly new tanks who missed brewfest, they're kind of screwed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the ONLY way at this point until Cataclysm. If you think otherwise you don't fully understand the situation and the consequences of any other action besides this, for now at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
With good healers this shouldn't be an issue at all, if you can't deal with some spike damage, do one of the following;<br />
1) Don't heal<br />
2) Get better at it (Today, this is basically the same as number 3 tho...)<br />
3) Get better gear (Today, this is basically the same as number 2 tho...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you even read the post? (also gear doesn't make a healer good...)<br />
<br />
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE HUGE DAMAGE SPIKES!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
It's about the gameplay those spikes encourage...which is more spammy and less reactive. Read the original post again, they fully explain that and I (and any self respecting healer/tank should) couldn't agree more.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;nerf&quot; was a must. Ask any half-decent healer. But all this crying about bears taking a harder beating than the rest of us truly shows a complete lack of competence.

I didn't mean these are all white swings. (Should have specified)<br />

<br />
Is it really so hard to add 64 ilvls to some items, equip them in players and than play with the characters a bit?<br />
<br />
If they did so, they could: <br />
<br />
Solve their avoidance problem before it would even exist, because they would look on t10 tank(in wotlk beta, create 18 items with bigger stats isnt really hard is it) and say omg thats wayyy to much avoidance, lets solve this problem so it never occurs.<br />
<br />
Solve their healers problem. For example, they could look at holy paladin. They should know that on t10 we will have gazilions of haste crit and thus infinite mana because of illumination(60%) and divine plea with only 25% reduction. But no, they had to nerf us steadikly throught content so we could match their ivllvs, because they failed at pretty easy math. Really, they had to know that paladins would be totally overpowered at healing in t10 gear with wotlk release abilitys. Yet still they released it and than nerfed them a bit every patch.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse they didnt know exact ilvls of t10, but they had some basic idea, 10-15 ilvls which could vary isnt that much, not that much that they would hide the problem.<br />
<br />
And this avoidance nerf is pretty cheap. I really hope they will calculate everything for cataclysm, that we wont see tons of mechanics and class changes every patch..or that we wont see -20% dodge in Deathwing raid. QQ ends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you think the details of tier's with ToC where thought out when they launched WotLK you are sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
Heck even hard modes (that truely rewarded gear for most of the bosses in an instance) weren't thought out. Sarth was an experiment, a successful one they decided to build on, and that building of started in ulduar which they may have been prepared for, but due to ToC being such a small instance, and how successful hard modes where in ulduar they made a decision to make 10/25 normal/heroic which they didn't intend at the beginning of LK, and I would think most people think that normal/heroic was a good idea.<br />
<br />
I term's of the nerf though, really only DK's TPS should be effected, since with current in game gear it wouldn't be possible to reallocate stats for pally's/warriors specifically to be under 20% dodge.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
although I do wonder if 10 man will suffer the same nerf considering the difference in item level.</div></div><hr />

Before, an unlucky parry counter (or a stream of counters in auriaya of uld because all the melee are standing in front of her as well) was very close to an intant death. you can lower your chance of parry by raising expertise and yes, toc25/togc25 gears have lots of expertise on them but you cant max expertise still there is a chance of this happening and it is not a pleasant scene for tanks or the healers. With less dodge and the less melee damage from bosses to make up for it, parry counters would be more forgiving too. <br />
<br />
Just to point out another thing that would be affect by this patch. :D I think a lot of people are forgetting about these. (Doesnt happen a lot for sure but still needs consideration.)</div></div><hr />

Exactly, we still have to see if the PTR version goes live or if the increase/decrease it in some way as well so people shouldn't be so worried about this. They're not going to push something live that makes no tank able to actually tank an encounter people...</div></div><hr />

<br />
From a tanking POV, I have already started having threat issues with my DK, especially when you have mages pulling 9-11k DPS on some fights. Hodir, Twin Valks et al. If my dodge is decreased, my proc rate on Rune Strikes drops 20% as well. Rune Strike is pretty much our main TPS ability in most respects. <br />
<br />
Solution? Up the threat on Rune Strike or Frost Strike/Plague Strike (I am sure they will look at this).<br />
<br />
As for Druids, your total avoidance has gone down 20%, same as everyone elses. Be thankful your TPS hopefully won't be affected!</div></div><hr />

Because there is such a huge diminishing return nerf on parry this is a non-issue. Druids will suffer the same reduction as other tanks and be similarly off for it.<br />
<br />
LMFAO at all these posts about druids. DKs have a legitmate concern because their threat is based so highly on Rune Strike, but Druids will probably actually be the perferred tanks for faster hitting bosses with their pseudo-block, huge HP pools, and high armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's pretty easy to make a healer have to move and not be able to spam cast the entire fight.<br />
<br />
Let's say ICC Boss X has a damage spell that works like the Vaelastrasz cleave of old (for those who dont remember or weren't around for BWL see bottom of the post), we'll call this spell Frost Cleave. Frost Cleave doesnt deal direct damage like Vael's, but instead produces a debuff that causes the inflicted target(s) to take x% additional damage and reduce mana by y%, we'll call this debuff Ice AIDS. Frost Cleave will stop chaining once a.) There is no-one else in range to chain to, or b.) It has hit 15 or 6 people depending on raid size. The debuff is spread evenly between the # of targets hit, if does not hit 15 / 6 targets by the end of its chain it will kill all targets afflicted by Ice AIDS. When Ice AIDS reaches 3 stacks it will instantly kill the afflicted target and start Frost Cleave on any target within 15 yards.<br />
<br />
Add in any type of raid wide damage and you have a fight that will require movement and coordination and punish chain casting huge heals. <br />
<br />
For those who dont remember or have never done Vaelastrasz <br />
Vael's cleaves chained from one target to another based on their distance from the person who just got hit, so if someone stood within 10 yds of the tank after he got cleaved they would get cleaved too and anyone within 10 yds of that person would then get cleaved, and so on.... So with terrible positioning you could potentially wipe the entire raid due to one cleave chaining everyone.</div></div><hr />

Not quite. At that level the druids are getting fuck all from dodge rating due to diminishing returns, while warriors are getting quite some. Most of the time, however, druids seem to get dodge from agi. Still this is a bit of a nerf to druids since they get hit by both the radiance and the DR (which was supposed to make the need for radiance void), while others only take the radiance hit.<br />
<br />
Druid tanks could really sorta use the nerf tho, its not a big one and theyre really good at the moment. The pala nerf combined with this, add a bit of a dk buff and BANG u end up with more balanced tanks!</div></div><hr />

Cause healer's have alot to do with causing the tank to take less damage! Other than things like Inspiration / Ancestral healing and PW:S healers can do almost nothing to prevent spike damage. If you land a Holy Light that heals 3% of the tanks health and overheals him for 18k and then the tank takes a 40k spike your overheal doesn't suddenly come back and heal half the damage he just took.<br />

I am a bear tank, and I have no issues with this change.<br />
<br />
20% = 20% if you're a bear, warrior, dk, or pally.<br />

Using the fail logic of trying to dump all your dodge and stack something else for non-bears, wouldn't I then drop all my agi gems, dodge talents, etc and go pure stam? Which I'd mention would also scale better for me as I'd be stacking stam without the DR of parry.<br />

At that level the druids are getting fuck all from dodge rating due to diminishing returns, while warriors are getting quite some. Most of the time, however, druids seem to get dodge from agi. Still this is a bit of a nerf to druids since they get hit by both the radiance and the DR (which was supposed to make the need for radiance void), while others only take the radiance hit.<br />
<br />
Druid tanks could really sorta use the nerf tho, its not a big one and theyre really good at the moment. The pala nerf combined with this, add a bit of a dk buff and BANG u end up with more balanced tanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
It depends how DR is effected by this though, if it'll be calculated before or after the aura is effected. Honestly though, it's way too early to really be concerned about this, it isn't even on the PTR yet and people are overreacting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just quoting the first post of this type. Let's take that post and use those stats for an example of a 1 minute fight.<br />
<br />
Tank has 52k hp in the raid with 25% dodge and 25% parry. That's 50% total.<br />
Boss does 25k dps with a 2 second swing timer = 25k hits every 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
Over the course of a fight you should avoid 50% of the boss swings. Boss swings 30 times over 60 seconds and 50% of that is 15 avoided swings. A theoretical 15 rune strikes (it happens that you could dodge 2 swings in a row before your next white hit but let's forget about that for now).<br />
<br />
Enter Icewell radiance.<br />
Tank now has 52k hp with 5% dodge and 25% parry. That's 30% total.<br />
Boss does 25k dps with a 1 second swing timer = 12.5k hits every second.<br />
<br />
Over the course of a fight you should avoid 30% of the boss swings. Boss swings 60 times over 60 seconds, and 30% of that is 18 avoided swings. A theoretical 18 rune strikes.<br />
<br />
Congrats morons you just got a buff on threat. But to be realistic, the problem of avoiding 2 swings in a row before your next white hit is still there so the numbers are still theoretical, just like the tank avoidance and the boss swings. Seriously though you people need to read/comprehend/think more. All you read is a 10 or 20% nerf to avoidance and don't read the fact that boss should be hitting faster for less damage per hit.<br />
<br />
On another note for DKs, their &quot;block mechanic&quot; of using death strike becomes more effective as well (possibly), maybe about as effective as pally/warrior block mechanics. Really only something to think about for blood DKs but still something to consider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heck even hard modes (that truely rewarded gear for most of the bosses in an instance) weren't thought out. Sarth was an experiment, a successful one they decided to build on, and that building of started in ulduar which they may have been prepared for, but due to ToC being such a small instance, and how successful hard modes where in ulduar they made a decision to make 10/25 normal/heroic which they didn't intend at the beginning of LK, and I would think most people think that normal/heroic was a good idea.<br />
<br />
I term's of the nerf though, really only DK's TPS should be effected, since with current in game gear it wouldn't be possible to reallocate stats for pally's/warriors specifically to be under 20% dodge.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
although I do wonder if 10 man will suffer the same nerf considering the difference in item level.<br />
<br />
<br />
You totally missed my point.<br />
<br />
My whole thought which i qqed about was simple fact: They already had some ilvl plan, eventhough it changed a bit. But not much(200 213 226 239, in 3.2 they basicly added another 6ilvls and in icecrown another 6ilvls, thats a 12ilvls overrall). So, with small variability, they should know what numbers will have players in t10 gear, and they should work with that from start. They surerly did, but there are mistakes. Obvious mistakes.<br />
<br />
What i said wasnt about hardmodes or so, it was about fact they they somehow failed at seeing the future of their own game. Holy paladins, for example, were nerfed thorught wotlk. As their gear goes up, the basic ability to spam big spells has to go down to match it. Because, if they didnt do nerfs throght wotlk, we would be OP, like a LOT. So they nerfed us thought the content, eventhough they had to knew that with our abilitys in release, nerf will have to come. See my point?<br />
<br />
As for tanks, the point remaints the same - They could without any problems see stats of their future tanks, however they let it be and now they did one big cut.<br />
<br />
I like only one thing from what they said. They realised what will gear-nerfs mean. And i belive they took this knowledge from Ulduar, when they served holy paladin totally crap gear just because crit/haste was too op. Reaction was that paladins had t7 gear for a long time. And iam happy that blizzard understood that nerfing thoughr gear is baaaad thing.</div></div><hr />

except they didn't say they were doubling boss attack speed anywhere. they say thats what they've been doing. they're doing the dodge debuff so they don't have to do it again. tho it would be pretty awesome if they actually WOULD do that. would make avoidance more appealing over all and fix and threat problems that dks would have. in fact if they made bosses hit every .1 second but do the same dps overall it would make avoidance a mitigation stat instead of &quot;cause spikes which messes up fail healers&quot; stat.</div></div><hr />

How do druid diminishing returns on dodge work btw? If it's the same as the other tanks, then this is a serious nerf. Not to mention the skills that require mobs to miss you somehow.<br />

Just because someone is experienced doesn't mean they never make mistakes. This is especially true when you're dealing with something as complex as WoW stats are atm.

<br />
Do you really think they will keep the same attack speed and attack damage but just reduce avoidance? Healers already have to spam heals the entire fight because if a tank gets hit twice he could die without a heal.<br />
<br />
The ENTIRE PURPOSE of the radiance is so that they can take some pressure off the healers and lower the spike damage. Sure nerfing avoidance will make the incoming damage more consistent, but that is only half the problem. They want to get away from healers having to just sit there and spam heal for fear of the tank dying. Just think about it man, it's not that hard of a concept.<br />
<br />
Very true that they did not state swing speeds are going to be doubled, which is why I said the numbers are theoretical. You know what theoretical means right?

Dodge is not damage reduction it is avoidance. The tanking class that has the highest health pool and the highest armor will do the best when the damage is reduced but not able to be avoided as much. The same reasons druids shined in the start of TBC (high health pool and high armor) still exist.</div></div><hr />

They've already talked about changing Rune Strike in the past. More specifically the &quot;On next swing&quot; mechanic and how it was potentially too good for burst, because it can be lined up with instant attacks for higher burst. It still does a nice chunk of damage (much higher than the comparable heroic strike) + can't be blocked / dodged / parried. There was talk at that time, about potentially changing Rune Strike to an instant strike and reducing the damage to split the burst into 2 globals rather than 1.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying DK's need a PvP nerf or anything of the sort, they could probably use some help in that area right now (keep in mind this was suggested around s6 when DK burst was higher in PvP). This change would, however, reduce the potential problem of double dodging during the rune strike &quot;queue,&quot; that could occur if Blizzard decreases the time between boss attacks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Offhand</div><div class="date">2009-10-30, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What We Know So Far!<br />
<br />
If think the dodge debate needs to be sorted out. I'm no hardcore theorycrafter, but I know the logic and reasoning behind the numbers.<br />
<br />
Druids vs. Everyone else: There's some debate as to whether druids get it in the rear more then other tanks. I can't answer that off the top of my head but I do know it can be easily derived. To find this, we need to consider the DR on three different types of avoidance, druid dodge (via agility), plate dodge (via rating), and plate parry (via rating). Now if you find the point-for-point returns for each of those stats for the average geared (245 and up) ToC tank, I'm sure you would find that they all break at least 20% dodge. Now with 20% dodge removed by some debuff, the combat rating do not magically change, all tanks are still suffering DR from their avoidance on gear. The question becomes, which combat rating has the returns after DR at this level (druid dodge, plate dodge and parry). Whoever get the best returns at these levels is ahead for Icecrown. You would need to come up with generally accepted &quot;average&quot; or &quot;BiS&quot; lists for all 4 tanks to do so. This can be determined rather easily with a little bit of work. I might get to it later but I would need some time to work on it.<br />
<br />
Sunwell Radiance all over again: Well, yes and no. The initial Sunwell radiance was implemented because of the so-called &quot;total avoidance tanks&quot; who managed to get way too many spinals from their guild for specially crafted avoidance sets. Rogues could even do it. 100% avoidance tanks were a problem primarily because they would dodge all incoming melee swings from boss. This came with the slight drawback of having practically no health and being destroyed by the first magic attack used against them (hence, it wasn't really all that viable but Blizzard was afraid of it anyway because of the potential design problems that would need to be worked around to stop it). The only 25 man raid boss, tanked by a level 70 rogue (before 3.0) was Gruul because he was the only boss with almost total avoidable melee damage. This required full Sunwell gear and epic gems (I should mention that both Sunwell level gear and that many spinals weren't at all easy to come by compared to today's raiding standards. I should stress that this didn't work against any boss with a magic or unavoidable attack (i.e. most of them), Sunwell radiance prevent Blizzard from having to balance around this severe design flaw.<br />
<br />
People QQ this game is too easy and then complain Sunwell radiance is too hard: I call bullshit on this one. Good game mechanics, challenging dances to properly execute a boss strat, and high personal performance requirements are the hallmarks of good game design for hard encounters. Adding grindy, time consuming, and annoying &quot;fuck you&quot; mechanics do not constitute good game design. I'm sorry, but because old school Four Horseman required four warriors to grind up a certain set bonus to make you less likely to be screwed over by what is totally-un-fucking-preventable RNG does not make for a good encounter no matter how hard you romance Vanilla WoW. &quot;You can't do this boss because you don't have the proper resist sets on the right people&quot; did not make Hydross hard either. Alternatively, good fights can exist despite these shortcomings (see Mu'ru and, in fact, most of Sunwell). I guess by contrast, Sunwell Radiance is less of a bullshit mechanic than most, as opposed to other methods (one hours worth of attempts, only 50 attempts period, giant attunement chains).<br />
<br />
DK threat is screwed: Well, people have a right to be legitimately concerned over this one. Seeing as dodge/parry is the only source of activating rune strike, and a huge chunk of it is going away. There needs to either by A) compensation built into the Radiance (maybe RS proc'ing off misses as well) or B) and overall buff to DK threat gen (which has the potential of making DK threat insanely overpowered everywhere else).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm done ranting.</div></div><hr />

You realize you're worrying about something that people haven't even tested yet that's not even going to be live (after it's been tested) for at least another month? Seriously, if you honestly think they'll let something go through that drastically effects another tank to the point where they can't tank encounters then you're yet another one of these people who overreact to every little thing a blue posts about before even thinking about it and before it's even implemented. I mean at least wait until people can test out the effects of it before worrying about it so much...<br />
<br />
Me posting on a wow fan site is hardly comparable to someone overreacting to announced changes that haven't even been implemented, let alone tested.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2009-10-30, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not quite. At that level the druids are getting fuck all from dodge rating due to diminishing returns, while warriors are getting quite some. Most of the time, however, druids seem to get dodge from agi. Still this is a bit of a nerf to druids since they get hit by both the radiance and the DR (which was supposed to make the need for radiance void), while others only take the radiance hit.<br />
<br />
Druid tanks could really sorta use the nerf tho, its not a big one and theyre really good at the moment. The pala nerf combined with this, add a bit of a dk buff and BANG u end up with more balanced tanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
You are ignoring the fact that savage defense will expand to cover the extra 20% of attacks providing druids with added mitigation, paladin block is much the same, they have so much excess block chance that it will just expand to cover the extra 20% of hits.<br />
<br />
If you look now you have:<br />
<br />
Warrior: 10% miss, 25% dodge, 20% parry, 25% block, 15% full damage<br />
Druid: 5% miss, 45% dodge, 50% at 25% reduced damage.<br />
DK: 10% miss, 25% dodge, 20% parry, 40% full damage.<br />
Pala: 10% miss, 25% dodge, 20% parry, 40% block.<br />
<br />
So with the removal of 20% of dodge that extra 20% of attacks will hit warriors and DKs for full damage, paladins will block the extra attacks and druids will gain savage defense against the other attacks just as often as they are gaining it now.<br />
<br />
So only warriors and DKs will take full damage from the extra 20% of hits. Paladins will block all the extra hits same as usual and druids will have 25% mitigation on a lot of them.<br />
<br />
Overall in level of impact I would say worst hit will be DKs since they lose both threat and take full damage on the extra hits plus sinice they are also waaaay into DR on parry (due to all their parry being from str or gear and none from talents) their avoidance won't scale up very well at all with better gear, followed by warriors who will take full damage on all the extra hits but can still make some gains on both parry + dodge from better gear and also could benefit from block rating if it is on the new tanking gear. Druids are third since they will be able to substantially mitigate the damage on a lot of those extra hits and paladins will not only block all the extra hits but see a threat increase from holy shield as an added bonus.<br />
<br />
I am surprised at the number of druids who seem to think 20% of their avoidance is somehow a bigger loss than 20% of some other tanks avoidance. 20% is 20%. Yes the way DR works means it will be a bit harder for druids to get their avoidance back up to the level it is now than it is for warriors but your mitigation ability automatically scales to cover the new hits which it does not for either warriors or DKs.</div></div><hr />

Yes i'm worrying. Because i'm a dk tank. I'm worried because they announced a potentially(emphasis on potential) class killing mechanic. I'm not saying they sky is falling and dk tanking is doomed.

Instead of calling everyone here actually worried for a good reason for once a moron?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. This isn't just &quot;my idea&quot; to fix the &quot;nerf&quot; or a theoretical fix. My NUMBERS are theoretical, as in not the exact numbers of every single boss attack, swing speed, tank health pool etc etc etc. Blizz is working to make damage less spiky. One of the ways to do that is to make bosses hit faster for less damage and take away some avoidance. If they only do one or the other they don't get the effect they are looking for.<br />
<br />
Just nerfing avoidance still leaves us at tanks taking huge hits where they could die very fast because of spike damage. Changing boss attack timers and damage could trivialize encounters because the chance of a string of hits landing on the tank fast enough to &quot;insta gib&quot; a tank is unlikely with current avoidance levels. It would be more likely that the tank is &quot;never&quot; in danger of dying. So yes, people that can't actually read the blue posts and see what is going on are morons.<br />
<br />
People are already crying that Blizz wants to get rid of DK tanks because of this &quot;nerf&quot; to them lol. Seriously, get a grip. It's not even on the PTR yet. Relax and wait for the tests. IF Blizz doesn't make the changes correctly (and in the process nerfs DK threat to unacceptable levels), that's when you should start to complain. ALL tanks are getting this nerf to avoidance, and with the way they said they have been/are changing encounters it means DKs should be just fine.</div></div><hr />

Well, while you may not be overreacting other people are and that's what my problem is. They just announced it today and people haven't even had a chance to test it yet people claim the sky is already falling. Get a grip, it's not something they'll let go through even as much as the blizz haters expect that it will.

IF attacks are small enough that block becomes worthwhile again, (blood) DKs have death strike, which is their &quot;block mechanic&quot;. It doesn't mitigate damage, but it could help smooth out incoming damage better than it does now. Healing for say 5k on a 25k hit is pretty useless with another 25k hit coming behind it. Healing for 5k on a 12.5k hit is better (the overall dps of the boss should be about the same though). Plus things like mark of blood are possibly more effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could easily fix this for Cataclysm. How? Get rid of the RNG from avoidance.<br />
<br />
Instead of dodging 100% of an enemy's damage 30% of the time, make it so that tanks dodge 30% of an enemy's damage 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
In addition, it seems more logical that a tank could cause a &quot;glancing&quot; type blow rather than dodge an enemy completely, especially in all that armor!<br />
<br />
In this manner, a tank would get hit by a boss 100% of the time, but he would reduce the damage taken by a combination of his armor, dodge, parry, and block (for paladins/warriors).<br />
<br />
This would completely eliminate &quot;spiking&quot; and allow healers to have more strategy in terms of using more mana efficient heals, not always spamming their biggest heal just so that the tank doesn't get two shot.<br />
<br />
On average, there wouldn't even be a huge change in damage taken, because a tank's 40% avoidance would just reduce 100% of the damage he takes by 40%, rather than taking 100% of the damage 60% of the time, and 0% damage 40% of the time.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
This would be a huge change in game mechanics, but I think it is a necessary one if you want to resolve this dilemma permanently.<br />
<br />
It would give you a lot more freedom in terms of encounter design, designing the combat ratings for level 85, and even the way that healing would play out in cataclysm (in terms of both heal numbers and mana costs).<br />

<br />
Actually adding hard modes was catering the the elitist assholes that thought the game revolved around the 1-3% that cleared hard content. Blizz wants all of their players to enjoy the game and they spend a ton of time and money developing content that they want everyone to enjoy. Since the majority of people don't have the skill, time or whatever else to raid SWP difficulty raids they bring them down to a more enjoyable level for them. Making hard modes has actually catered to the &lt;5% VERY vocal minority whining that the game was becoming too easy.<br />
<br />
Not everyone that could clear SWP was an elitist, is was the minority of a minority that were unhappy. To be honest, probably half of the whiners never even did clear the hard content and still don't clear hard modes, yet still manage to whine about the game being too easy.</div></div><hr />

One problem with that (under current stats) is that tank armor is already mitigating 60% or more of physical damage. I am probably wrong, but armor cap is 70 or 75% damage mitigation no? Well either way, this means that between armor and dodge/parry/block, it would be fairly easy to reach 100% mitigation 100% of the time lol. It couldn't be just a simple conversion like he states. It's an interesting idea though, and the part about a tank being more likely to cause a &quot;glancing blow&quot; for less damage makes some sense.</div></div><hr />

So let me get this straight.... after blizzard nerf armor and stamina on feral tanks cause hp poll was too big and armor was too much and give that stupid shild (not even a decent animation they gave for SD, just a crappy buff on the corner) they're staying: &quot;yes... please stack stamina like a mad man.... go 10k hp more than other tank classes... sometimes i can't understand this game.<br />

BTW this is a QQ post<br />

anyway... /2 feral druid tank in 3.2 with decent gear LFguild for 3.3 as feral dps, willing to aply if your guild pay me the gems and chanting on my gear... thanks.<br />

The only thing i never understood is blizzard is not a 3 man company, thousands of ppl work there, and noone ever thougth before releasing this stupid ideia to nerf dodge avoidance (to read: nerf druid to go rdps/mdps/healer) cause to be honest... ok all class with be screwed, more healing etc etc etc, tanks with less avoidance bla bla bla, more hp spikes all the crap, but the class more screwed with this is druids... i can't belive noone between breakfast and lunch on blizzard said... &quot;wait a minute... we're killing feral tanks on 3.3.<br />

It could just be applied after armor (just like block is). However the only thing I don't like about it is that it feels like armor (flat decrease in dmg taken), and thus miss+parry+dodge+armor is pretty much the same and you just balance around it.<br />

As such, I think bears will have the least to lose here.<br />

<br />
I also think GC and the design team is blatantly wrong here. As a warriortank, I don't get to tank Beasts on Grand Crusader. Why? Because I get flattened if I can't dodge two consecutive hits. Now apply Radiance. The chance of me dodging twice in a row is drastically lowered. My healthpool doesn't increase though. Hence, I might as well be a wet paper napkin.<br />
<br />
One has to wonder, instead of just flat out removing 20% dodge... why not tweak the Diminishing Returns on avoidance stats? Lower the bar for the stats to start diminishing, make them diminish at a steeper rate and voila! Tanks will never be able to cap the stat... Now pay me my design fee.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, the only thing I'm wondering about right now is if I can pool together a set without any dodge rating on it at all...</div></div><hr />

You might have missed the part where Blizz stated they have been making changes all around (many of which are likely to be in ICC as well). So there is a good chance of something like bosses hitting faster but for less damage per strike. Instead of 2 hits to kill a tank, it could be 3-5, and the chances of you not avoiding one of those is lower than you not dodging 2 in a row at higher avoidance levels. In other words, it would be less likely that a tank gets insta gibbed and slightly smoother healing. Don't just assume that bosses will hit just as hard and fast but they are taking away 20% avoidance. That would be a pretty big hit to healer mana as well as tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone has 0% chance to avoid damage. Every tank gets hit 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Which tank would you prefer to bring? A warrior? DK? Paladin? Or a druid who has the highest effective health and stam/armor of all tanking classes? Obviously, you bring the druid. Any change that reduces avoidance favors druids, not the other way around. If you're going to get hit more, then getting hit for less becomes dramatically more important.</div></div><hr />

They've already mentioned possibly applying this aspect to the block mechanic so it wouldn't surprise me if they do it to all forms of avoidance/mitigation. However, as someone else already posted, they'd have to also incorporate armor mitigation into this as obviously some tanks have more armor than others to even it out. Overall though changing all forms of avoidance to a flat % to reduce incoming damage rather than a % to completely avoid it would obviously be the most beneficial method while keeping the stats in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pulling numbers out of my ass, let's say a tank has 30,000hp, boss hits for 12,000, and you heal for 6,000. You healed 20% of his max life and half of the damage done. <br />
You gear up and now you heal for 10,000, but the tank has 50,000hp and the boss hits for 20,000. You're still healing 20% of the tank's max life and half of the damage done.<br />
<br />
Similar process for damage dealers, your damage per spell goes up but so does boss hp, so you're still removing roughly the same % of health each time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2009-10-30, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem that nobody is pointing out is that by moving to bigger health pools and less spiky damage they are going to be taking a lot of the skill out of tanking in general.<br />
<br />
If you normalise incoming damage so that the game becomes about healers managing their mana then the tank is basically nothing more than a threat magnet. If the damage incoming is reduced to the point that reactive healing becomes the norm as opposed to the current spam heal mechanic then correct use of tank cooldowns becomes irrelevant. Why would a tank ever need to use a reactive tanking cooldown in a situation where damage is low enough for reactive healing to keep him alive?<br />
<br />
Like it or not, the only thing that makes later raids harder is the spiky damage. Most of the OMG the tank got 2 shot stories are way overblown and are, for the most part to do with the tanks being undergeared. You tried doing ToC HC with a tank with less than 40k hp unbuffed and he got two shotted? Have you considered actually going with a tank who is appropriately geared for the instance?<br />
<br />
The tools to manage this are all in the game already, healers have defensive cooldowns, tanks have defensive cooldowns, the problem is most people are too lazy or uncoordinated to use them efficiently. Your tank got hit for 35k with 2 stacks of bleed on him? It is a 2 minute fight, with 3 tanks (maybe 2) in a 25 man raid. How the hell did your tank not have some form of damage mitigation active on him at that point?<br />
<br />
Nevermind that it is only the hard modes that are causing any of these issues, aren't hard modes supposed to be, you know, hard? Do even the hard modes need to be made easy now too?<br />
<br />
Anyone who ever made a post complaining about the difficulty of a hard or heroic mode encounter just doesn't get the point. They are supposed to be hard. They are not there for the benefit of the people who want to just faceroll and get epics, you have normal modes for that. Hard modes are there for the benefit of the people who want to push themselves to the limit of their skills. Is it so hard for people to accept that success is generally achieved because you (and the raid you are in) were good enough to succeed, and failure is because you were not good enough?<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;lets turn healing into mana managment&quot; point, has any healer in the history of the game ever said the game would be more fun if they had to just manage their mana better? Of course not because having to manage your mana is very, very boring. There is no skill involved whatsoever. Encounters based on mana managment turn healing into nothing more than a gear check. Worse still it changes the dynamic of player skill. Right now a good healer can make up for a bad one in a raid. He can heal more, faster, better and thus make up for the shortfalls of the other. Once overheal is gone it changes completely. Now a bad healer who wastes his mana will bring the raid down. The good healer can no longer make any difference because he will go oom if he tries to make up the shortfall. That is not fun. That is not conducive to encouraging any sort of player skill. By making it a mana managment game the skill cap for healing ends up being set much much lower than it is currently. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I also think GC and the design team is blatantly wrong here. As a warriortank, I don't get to tank Beasts on Grand Crusader. Why? Because I get flattened if I can't dodge two consecutive hits.

<br />
That is blatent nonsense. Premonition, Ensidia, Vodka, Method all these guilds use warrior tanks and all use them on Northrend Beasts. As a warrior tank you have the same miss, dodge, parry, armor, health pool and mitigation as a DK or Paladin. Yeah a paladin will block more often but they don't have anything near the quality of defensive cooldowns you get as a warrior. <br />
<br />
If you are dying on that encounter more than the other tanks it is because you are not playing well. Are you 5/15/51 specced? Are you keeping up imp demo shout? Are you using Potions of Invincibility? Are you using shield block for the entire 10 seconds you will be tanking at 2 stacks? Is the tank after you quick about taunting at the end of your rotation? Have you arranged to tell a healer when you need one of their defensive cooldowns to be used if you don't have your own ready? Do you have 40k health unbuffed? Have you either Last Stand or Shield Wall active coming to the transition with a trinket and ideally enraged regeneration popped as well just as the last stack is applied? If you answered no to any one of those then the problem is you.<br />
<br />
Even if you aren't doing any of those things Impale + Autoattack can happen to you at most a total of 6 times over the entire fight. Last stand and shield wall, used correctly will cover the 4 of those, if you glyph and talent for either you can cover all six. <br />
<br />
Of course if you are just showing up with 35k health, flask in hand and expecting to do hard modes then you will die, it is HARD you need to play efficiently. Crying that hard mode is hard is as stupid as people crying that the easy modes are easy. If the hard modes were going to be easy then there wouldn't be any point in having them now would there?<br />
<br />
If there are many, many warriors out there tanking on these encounters with no difficulty have you considered that maybe, just maybe, the problem is you? You see the same in every forum, bear druids, dk tanks, paladins all saying they are getting shelved on that boss because all the other tanks in their guild take less damage and have more health. The reality is that these players for the most part just plain suck. All classes can and have tanked all of these encounters and there are players of every class that can repeatedly and consistently tank them successfully. It is more likely that you just happen to be the least skilled tank in your guild. Some tank in every guild has to be the least skilled, just accept that in your guild it is probably you and they are too polite to say so and nod in agreement when you claim it is your class that is to blame.</div></div><hr />

If the damage incoming is reduced to the point that reactive healing becomes the norm as opposed to the current spam heal mechanic then correct use of tank cooldowns becomes irrelevant. Why would a tank ever need to use a reactive tanking cooldown in a situation where damage is low enough for reactive healing to keep him alive?<br />
<br />
Like it or not, the only thing that makes later raids harder is the spiky damage. Most of the OMG the tank got 2 shot stories are way overblown and are, for the most part to do with the tanks being undergeared. You tried doing ToC HC with a tank with less than 40k hp unbuffed and he got two shotted? Have you considered actually going with a tank who is appropriately geared for the instance?<br />
<br />
The tools to manage this are all in the game already, healers have defensive cooldowns, tanks have defensive cooldowns, the problem is most people are too lazy or uncoordinated to use them efficiently. Your tank got hit for 35k with 2 stacks of bleed on him? It is a 2 minute fight, with 3 tanks (maybe 2) in a 25 man raid. How the hell did your tank not have some form of damage mitigation active on him at that point?<br />
<br />
Nevermind that it is only the hard modes that are causing any of these issues, aren't hard modes supposed to be, you know, hard? Do even the hard modes need to be made easy now too?<br />
<br />
Anyone who ever made a post complaining about the difficulty of a hard or heroic mode encounter just doesn't get the point. They are supposed to be hard. They are not there for the benefit of the people who want to just faceroll and get epics, you have normal modes for that. Hard modes are there for the benefit of the people who want to push themselves to the limit of their skills. Is it so hard for people to accept that success is generally achieved because you (and the raid you are in) were good enough to succeed, and failure is because you were not good enough?<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;lets turn healing into mana managment&quot; point, has any healer in the history of the game ever said the game would be more fun if they had to just manage their mana better? Of course not because having to manage your mana is very, very boring. There is no skill involved whatsoever. Encounters based on mana managment turn healing into nothing more than a gear check. Worse still it changes the dynamic of player skill. Right now a good healer can make up for a bad one in a raid. He can heal more, faster, better and thus make up for the shortfalls of the other. Once overheal is gone it changes completely. Now a bad healer who wastes his mana will bring the raid down. The good healer can no longer make any difference because he will go oom if he tries to make up the shortfall. That is not fun. That is not conducive to encouraging any sort of player skill. By making it a mana managment game the skill cap for healing ends up being set much much lower than it is currently. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While mostly true, the easy counter to normalizing damage is to give bosses special abilities to make up for this that healers and tanks would have to take into account for. I don't think it necessarily takes the skill out of tanking by normalizing damage, it just makes gear easier to setup for encounters. The primary thing they want to remove from the game is the instant gibs that happen to all tanks just randomly and normalizing the auto attack damage of a boss helps with that as does change avoidance and mitigation stats to reducing a static percent of incoming damage rather than a percent to completely avoid damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though it comes at the cost of making tanks feel less awesome and feel like they took a downgrade again. I know the feeling. Hopefully they come up with a better solution than this in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
But what about DPS? Boss health goes up and you still on average kill bosses in 5 minutes regardless of your bigger crit numbers. Sure it means those bigger crit numbers make bosses on farm die faster, but just like tanking if you tanked naxx or ulduar right now you still have that extra dodge. It's all relative.<br />
<br />
Actually this guy says it better:<br />
<br />
IF you think healing and damage stats dont suffer some sort of reduction, well they do but in a round-about way.<br />
<br />
Pulling numbers out of my ass, let's say a tank has 30,000hp, boss hits for 12,000, and you heal for 6,000. You healed 20% of his max life and half of the damage done. <br />
You gear up and now you heal for 10,000, but the tank has 50,000hp and the boss hits for 20,000. You're still healing 20% of the tank's max life and half of the damage done.<br />
<br />
Similar process for damage dealers, your damage per spell goes up but so does boss hp, so you're still removing roughly the same % of health each time.</div></div><hr />

The only difference is the plate classes can swap gear / gems / chants to mess with this druid has no options.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course you can that argue with their bigger health pools, higher armor and the way savage defense covers the entirety of the unavoided damage spectrum druids are the tanks that are optimised for low avoidance situations. Going from 55% avoidance to 35% avoidance as druids do means a 44% increase in incoming damage on the druid. Going from 60% avoidance to 40% avoidance for a warrior means a 50% increase in incoming damage on the warrior.<br />
<br />
But lets go a bit further, assume that warrior also has 25% block and that each block reduces the damage from that hit by 10%.<br />
<br />
Now we have a warrior with:<br />
<br />
10% miss, 30% dodge, 20% parry, 25% (10% reduced), 15% full damage.<br />
<br />
Going to:<br />
10% miss, 10% dodge, 20% parry, 25% (10% reduced), 35% full damage.<br />
<br />
In that case the incoming damage on the warrior has gone up by 53.3%. <br />
<br />
So this is going to hit warriors much harder, the druid only takes 44% more damage while the warrior takes 53.5% more damage. The change hits warriors 21.5% harder than it hits druids!<br />
<br />
If you rate shield block a bit higher and say it reduces damage from blocked attacks by 20% then the warrior will be taking 57.14% increased damage, meaning the incoming damage on the warrior will be scaled up 35.7% more than the incoming damage on druids will scale up.<br />
<br />
So if right now you consider warriors and druids as equal, after this change druids will be flat out better since proportionally they will be taking less damage after the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think about it it is obvious. If two tanks are balanced, one has 20% avoidance, the other has 80% avoidance losing 20% avoidance each is a much bigger hit to the guy at 80% avoidance, the first tank will take 25% more damage after the nerf, the second would take 100% more damage after the nerf. So, counterintuitively a flat avoidance nerf applied equally to all tanks hits the tanks with the most avoidance the hardest.</div></div><hr />

ok, ill try to but it simple, for the QQers, if they reduce dmg taken by same amount as they nerf avoidance its a BUFF for tanking<br />

if there was a biss that hit for 40kevery 2secs, would you prefer the tank with 50k health and 75% avoidance, or the tank with 25% avoidnce who mitigates the attacks down to around 20k</div></div><hr />

Stop nerdraging, we don't even know how hard the boss will hit so stop complaining. And every class whining about their tanking potential destroyed with this Spell makes me laugh. In the end, you will still go tanking there right ? Your guild will still down bosses hmmm ? They won't fire you because you're a DK tank and you will suck (more than usual) !</div></div><hr />

and before we see every druid reroll kitty spec and all the top guild only use &quot;insert whatever class has most avoidance after this&quot; tanks in their ICC raids. i wont QQ at all, at least not about this great change, and to the part about giving mobs expertise, hit rating and maybe even other stats, im quite positive aswell, sounds like a good plan to me. at least if they dont make us do hour long parses to find the amounts...</div></div><hr />

When they make almost every class have the same abilities (e.g. mana-reg : in BC it was the role of a shadow, now itÂ´s also hunter, paladin, ....) the people shout &quot;OMG! Everyone is the same here. What is going on. We need classes to have different roles and functions, we donÂ´t like the &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; appoach from blizz.<br />
<br />
Now we might have a raidinstance where some classes do fit better into the conditions than others, and guess whats going on ? &quot;mimimi my class is not exactly on the same level as the other tank classes. mimimi every tank class should have identical conditions...&quot;<br />

sitting at 2000 agility raidbuffed DR are already fucking an avoidance gemmed druid up so much, that he is ~6% behind in avoidance compared to full stamina-warriors (who then has as much HP as the druid). while this may be okay right now overall, it is a complete scaling mess for druids.

<br />
Naked I have 10% dodge on my pally. With gear I have 27%. With diminishing returns I am gaining 17% dodge from my 245 gear. This statement above is complete nonsense. They are taking away more dodge than my gear even provides me currently. There is no way that the difference between 245 gear and the expected IC gear is to blame. 20% seems way too high, its higher than my gear even provides. I could see MAYBE 10% but when its higher than gear provides it seems like a poor solution. I now have a completely wasted stat on my gear. If I had no dodge on my gear and no &quot;We are grasping at straws&quot; debuff I would be 3% ahead of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
healers need to do more and tanks need to rotate cooldowns, brings back that actually if youre skilled you can make them small differences. And not to mention the thing that makes me most happy is that you need to think about socketing/enchants rather than just be a common wotlk tank and &quot;stack as much stamina as you can to make you imba&quot;<br />
<br />
if you think about 25 normal mode raiding (wich is the thing most guilds do) theres no really much to do these days.. i mean you can carry 10 slackers and still get trough the encounters. And yes theres many players that are skilled for 25 hardmodes, but their guilds dont have enough skill/players to do them so theyre stuck at normals. No one whos cleared BT and Sunwell pre 3.0 cant say that raids have been &quot;ok&quot; difficulty wise..Ulduar brought bit with Yogg-Saron being hard when Ulduar patch came(prenerffed Yogg i mean)<br />
and now is worthless when ppl get better gear by just doing dailies and pugging toc10 everyweek..<br />

hopefully this makes the instance a little more worth to clear/farm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lassy</div><div class="date">2009-10-30, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is blatent nonsense. Premonition, Ensidia, Vodka, Method all these guilds use warrior tanks and all use them on Northrend Beasts. As a warrior tank you have the same miss, dodge, parry, armor, health pool and mitigation as a DK or Paladin. Yeah a paladin will block more often but they don't have anything near the quality of defensive cooldowns you get as a warrior. <br />
<br />
If you are dying on that encounter more than the other tanks it is because you are not playing well. Are you 5/15/51 specced? Are you keeping up imp demo shout? Are you using Potions of Invincibility? Are you using shield block for the entire 10 seconds you will be tanking at 2 stacks? Is the tank after you quick about taunting at the end of your rotation? Have you arranged to tell a healer when you need one of their defensive cooldowns to be used if you don't have your own ready? Do you have 40k health unbuffed? Have you either Last Stand or Shield Wall active coming to the transition with a trinket and ideally enraged regeneration popped as well just as the last stack is applied? If you answered no to any one of those then the problem is you.<br />
<br />
Even if you aren't doing any of those things Impale + Autoattack can happen to you at most a total of 6 times over the entire fight. Last stand and shield wall, used correctly will cover the 4 of those, if you glyph and talent for either you can cover all six. <br />
<br />
Of course if you are just showing up with 35k health, flask in hand and expecting to do hard modes then you will die, it is HARD you need to play efficiently. Crying that hard mode is hard is as stupid as people crying that the easy modes are easy. If the hard modes were going to be easy then there wouldn't be any point in having them now would there?<br />
<br />
If there are many, many warriors out there tanking on these encounters with no difficulty have you considered that maybe, just maybe, the problem is you? You see the same in every forum, bear druids, dk tanks, paladins all saying they are getting shelved on that boss because all the other tanks in their guild take less damage and have more health. The reality is that these players for the most part just plain suck. All classes can and have tanked all of these encounters and there are players of every class that can repeatedly and consistently tank them successfully. It is more likely that you just happen to be the least skilled tank in your guild. Some tank in every guild has to be the least skilled, just accept that in your guild it is probably you and they are too polite to say so and nod in agreement when you claim it is your class that is to blame.<br />
<br />
<br />
The guilds you named are 25man guilds. They have access to gear that I, as a 10man strict raider, do not have access to. Before you start calling me a scrub, in many fancy words, consider that perhaps I was talking in a hyperbole.<br />
<br />
I can and once have tanked ToGC beasts. The fact that the healers cry and it's a 50/50 chance if I die or not is what's the problem. Defensive cooldowns you ask? Exactly which defensive cooldowns am I supposed to get from druids? Our paladin helps out, but again, it's a hit-and-miss situation. When I layer Radiance over my experiences thus far... Things don't look pretty. And bosses won't hit less hard than they do know, they will be hitting for the same amount, where one would expect them to hit harder in a new tier of raiding.<br />
<br />
Also, claim again that warriors have the same healthpools as paladins and I'll assume you've had an aneurysm, rather than just having a slip of the tongue. Stamina scaling, look into it.<br />
<br />
Buuut, that's all slightly besides the point up for discussion, isn't it?<br />

<br />
As for the &quot;lets turn healing into mana managment&quot; point, has any healer in the history of the game ever said the game would be more fun if they had to just manage their mana better? Of course not because having to manage your mana is very, very boring.<br />

&quot;Enemy bosses and mobs ignore up to 20% of your dodge, block or parry chances, depending on your higest&quot;. <br />
otherwise it will be a lot more effective for druids than other classes that focus on other avoidance stat. <br />
for an example, if a paladin has 19.50% dodge chance and 30% parry chance the chill of the throne will be less effective compared to a tank that has 20% or more dodge.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Im trying not to be aggressive guys i just want to know.<br />

The change hits warriors 21.5% harder than it hits druids!<br />
<br />
So if right now you consider warriors and druids as equal, after this change druids will be flat out better since proportionally they will be taking less damage after the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think about it it is obvious. If two tanks are balanced, one has 20% avoidance, the other has 80% avoidance losing 20% avoidance each is a much bigger hit to the guy at 80% avoidance, the first tank will take 25% more damage after the nerf, the second would take 100% more damage after the nerf. So, counterintuitively a flat avoidance nerf applied equally to all tanks hits the tanks with the most avoidance the hardest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ummm no. While technically correct in your assumption that incoming damage increase is bigger on the tank with higher avoidance, you are looking at it wrong. The tank that went from 80% to 60% is still going to avoid 60% of the physical attacks which is 60% more than the tank that went from 20% to 0%. Which tank would you take, the one that can still avoid over half the incoming damage or the one that will make your healers go oom? That answer is pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
Not so clear with more reasonable numbers, which everyone seems to put at druids being 5-10% behind in avoidance. This would make them worse tanks, if not for their higher HP and armor. The only problem I see here is from looking at the BS tanking gear. Seems that there will be bonus armor on it, and perhaps there will be more items like that in ICC. Could this catch up plate tanks to bear tanks in armor/mitigation? I don't know, just more stuff we'll have to wait and see from the PTR.<br />
<br />
Either way a 20% nerf is the same to all classes.</div></div><hr />

If you read what I put, I wasnt asking for a nerf. I simply agree with blizz that there is a need for a rebalance. And Gormokk is a good example as he is one of the hardest hitters.. and current. Thorim is'nt a good example of an endgame boss :P</div></div><hr />

They can just stop making push_shieldwall_or_die bosses instead of this -20% aura. Isnt it better? <br />

All the gear you have picked up that is dodge-centric is now completely useless and needs to be replaced with better options. Used to use a dodge trinket ? Now you better find a def or parry one, etc etc. All it does is basically nerf half of all tank plate and forces tanks to re-gear.<br />
<br />
The core of the problem isn't rooted in avoidance at all. The problem is the scaling of healing, it's so grossly overpowered a single heal can heal up to half the full health bar of a tank. If they toned down healing they could tone down damage done, and everything would be fine. And it's not only a problem in PvE, in PvP it's become so overpowered that one of the most sought after abilities is to be able to reduce healing taken. <br />
<br />
GC says it himself: <br />
&quot;The high levels of tank avoidance players have obtained is making the incoming damage a tank DOES take more &quot;spiky&quot; than is healthy for raiding. Ideally, tanks would be receiving a relatively constant stream of damage over time. This allows healers to better plan their healing strategy, broaden their spell options, and simply give more time to react.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is a healer problem, not a tank problem. When you make the potential for healing &quot;spiky&quot;, you also make the damage done necessary to challenge it &quot;spiky&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's the recurring theme in WotLK, first with the mana regen nerf in patch 3.1, now this; making it harder for healers = harder for everybody, apparently. The shortage of healers doesn't help either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, people like you need to get a grip and wait for the PTR as well as learn to read and think a little more.<br />
<br />
On average bosses should be hitting faster than before, which means more strikes over the same period of time. So with lower avoidance that means you may have the same (or maybe even more) dodges/parries than you would have. Rune strike will probably have a similar proc rate over the length of a fight, and IF it doesn't then Blizz may need to do something to help out with threat. That's not even a given since we don't know for sure that threat will be an issue.<br />
<br />
A 20% nerf to dodge may not mean a 20% nerf Rune strike. You already don't convert every dodge/parry to a RS attack so don't assume an exact 20% loss to RS attacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Apocalypse is upon us.<br />
<br />
<br />
10% dodge, isn't that huge of a loss, to be honest, even for a druid tank. The gear offered from 5, 10, and 25 will probably make up for the 10% lost from ulduar/togc gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Say your average geared tank has 35% avoidance that breaks down as follows:<br />
5% Base Dodge<br />
5% Talent Dodge<br />
5% Defense Cap Dodge<br />
20% Gear<br />
<br />
This means we are literally dodging as if we were naked (to an extent)</div></div><hr />

Tanks dodge less = more hits.<br />
Bosses hit lighter = Smaller damage.<br />

Add the two together, you get a more constant, but steady stream of damage over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Offhand:<br />
<br />
The only 25 man raid boss, tanked by a level 70 rogue (before 3.0) was Gruul...&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually that is false. There were total of three bosses succesfully tanked from 100% to 0% by the same rogue. You should be able to still find videos of the kills floating somewhere. The bosses killed were: Gruul (5 manned, also showcasing interesting fact that Gruul's growth stack resets after certain time period), Illidan and Mother Shazzraz. These were all bosses who only hit the tank with pure physical attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the whole &quot;&lt;insert tank class&gt;s are screwed!&quot; business:<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids: You can't just say &quot;omg I lost biggest % of my total avoidance out of all tanks!&quot; While it may be true (20% of say, 45% avoidance is bigger portion than 20% of say, 50% avoidance).<br />
<br />
However, that's not the whole bloody picture. As the druid tanks with a clue have already pointed out, druids have highest effective health and - outside quirk fights where block is actually something worth mentioning - highest mitigation out of the tank classes. You get hit more - as you do now - and you mitigate more - as you do now - which ends up meaning you compare roughly the same to the other tanks. In fact, as pointed by some druid tanks with a clue in here, you're likely to fare better than other tanks in ICC due &quot;Icecrown Radiance&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knights: Wait and see. With the reduced avoidance it's only logical - and already heavily implied - that bosses will attack faster but for lower amounts of damage, meaning more chances to dodge/parry. It's likely to even out. If it doesn't and you continue to drop even more behind other tanks, Blizzard will most likely do something to deal with the situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the people complaining about this change... Yes, Blizzard fucked up. Yes, it's a bit lazy fix. But most importantly of all yes, it was needed.<br />
<br />
Now, let's clear something up. Gormok the Impaler (and more imporantly, TotGC25 version of him) has been mentioned plenty of times here. I've done the fight myself a few times as DPS, and I do remember checking logs after wipes to see some 60k+ bursts in under a second. Now plenty of the wannabe elitist jerks have already pointed out that &quot;nub tanks lrn2use defensive cooldowns!&quot; In this case, yes, it's doable simply because of how the fight is designed: you have very limited time to kill him, which means you'll have those cooldowns to spare on him.<br />
<br />
Now let's have a theoretic fight, where you fight a copy of Gormok, but this time he has enough health for the fight to last 5-7 minutes. Let's say this is one of the early fights in ICC, meaning the latter bosses will do even more damage, which due high avoidance will be even more spiky. Would you honestly want to do a fights like that?<br />
<br />
Now honestly, I don't know a single healer who enjoys that kind of fights, simply because a) spamming your biggest heal doesn't take skill and b) it's not a test of skill, it's playing russian roulette with the tank's life, simple as that.<br />
<br />
I for one as someone who has played all roles in raid to varying degrees eagerly wait for fights that move more away from &quot;massive tank damage with random hazards that distract you from tank healing&quot; and add some more flavor to raiding. I would be happy to see more fights like Yogg-saron, for example.</div></div><hr />

My point is, if I'm this warrior I change my gear around so I'm at 15% dodge, and 25% parry before I go into ICC. The druid has no option on his gear but to switch dodge out for stam, but he's never going to get below 20% dodge, even stam stacking. Now both of these characters go into ICC. The druid will now have 20%, all dodge, and the warrior will have 25%, all parry. The druid gets a bigger nerf in this example.<br />

Hehe, I was more referring to fight not being the same old boring &quot;big mob tanked by 1-3 tanks while DPS and healers do their jobs while avoiding Obvious_Death_Zone_X&quot; as well as having real unique mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I find the community reaction stupid. -20% dodge was added to allow them to make bosses hit a bit softer so the fights aren't pure spam healing for healers and praying they manage to land the heals just between two hits instead of too early or too late. They don't even really need to make the new bosses hit faster, since the tanks will be hit more often, making the overall DPS higher than with current bosses, just less spiky.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also find it quite funny that some tanks are seriously saying they'll drop dodge and stack parry... Even assuming there was gear that would allow you to drop below 20% dodge (doubtful) you would end up with less avoidance than if you were stacking both due the punitive diminishing returns on parry. I mean, my Naxx25 geared alt warrior has over 20% dodge after diminishing returns even without going out of my way to get it. Only way to do it would most likely be dropping 5% dodge from talents, but there really aren't that many places to usefully spend those points elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

This change definitely favours tanks with lower avoidance due to the exponential decrease to hits taken that comes with raises in avoidance<br />
<br />
@ 40%avoidance you now avoid 20% of hits <br />
Tank taking 8/10 hits instead of 6/10 = 33% more hits than previous <br />
<br />
@ 60% avoidance you now avoid 40% of hits<br />
Tank taking 6/10 hits instead of 4/10 = 50% more hits than previous<br />
<br />
Druids characterised by relatively lower avoidance and high EH will cope well with these changes and people crying about it forgot to put 'I donâ€™t know what I is talking about' in their signatures, but donâ€™t worry... we worked it out anyway<br />
Iâ€™m wondering if the change will make block mechanics a viable avenue for mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however what I'm concerned about is what some people already stated, Dk's threat. Rune strike is a big part of building threat as a dk and removing 20% of my dodge will in the end affect rune strike big time. I have tanked since wotlk release on my dk and for every patch that comes it feels like my threat gets lower and lower cus of nerfs that has mostly been directed at pvp dps or pve dps, but also hits us dk tanks since we don't got a specific tree like other classes. and while people get more gear to optimize their dps output effectively increasing their threat at the same time, while my threat as mostly scaled from a weapon change not so much from gear. and i can say its a lot harder now to stay above some classes in threat but not impossible (this ofc depends bossfights). I'm looking forward to how this will affect us, and what they will do if this becomes a problem.<br />
<br />
also the stamina trinkets that was data mined not long ago, 24/27 stamina each stack, 10 stacks, 10sec duration and gets renewed every time i dodge. how is this gonna work out with 10% dodge?<br />
<br />
<br />
They stated in the patch notes that they are increasing the threat of rune strike by 17%.</div></div><hr />
