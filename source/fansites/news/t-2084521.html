Yeah, something is really, really fucking broken with him. He spawns like 50+ adds and it lags the fuck out of everything. Even with my 3.5ghz quad core processor and GTX 970, I was running at like 10 fps.<br />
<br />
Even outside of that, the whole area was just a mess of ground-based AoE zones that exploded for like 40% of your health, just being spammed everywhere all the time. What the fuck even is this world boss?<br />
<br />
I just stayed back as far as I could and kept myself alive, while keeping a single DoT on 'em. Got me a nice trinket. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, EnemyGrid (and anything related) will be gutted.<br />
<br />
Second, unit frames that showed the direction of out of range players (mostly for healers) will no longer be able to do that. In addition any boss mod that relied on knowing where other players were in relation to you will be broken, as will any boss mod that relied on knowing how close you were to other players will be seriously limited.<br />
<br />
For a concrete example, any addon that helped with wrought chaos or shackled torment on Mythic Archimonde will be broken, as will basically any addon that popped up a &quot;GPS nav style&quot; arrow in combat for any reason, or which displayed a &quot;radar&quot; type display to help players spread out (eg, to avoid shadowfel burst).<br />
<br />
It's a pretty massive change, honestly, and I'm a little skeptical about it.</div></div><hr />

Mogushan release schedule from MoP. 1 boss less and came out way quicker than EN. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/7435940/mogu-shan-vaults-now-live-raid-schedule<br />
<br />
Heart of Fear. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/7705231<br />
<br />
Throne of Thunder. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/8789565/throne-of-thunder-raid-schedule<br />
<br />
You get the point basically gating has been the same for most if not all the raids. Throne was bigger so of course it could be gated longer. Same with Siege. Siege was actually gated longer because they could due to it being both a large raid and having a new difficulty in the form of Flex. As for the 10.1 mil subs turns out it was a misquote so we have no idea how many are playing again now.</div></div><hr />

How about that nameplate thing? Will it still be possible to have a hovermacro for spell and use on people's nameplates? Like if you have spell interrupt on a hovermacro so you dont have to swap target to interrupt a secondary enemy?</div></div><hr />

No it should read Regrowth following the previous 7.1 notes where Regrowth replaces Healing Touch in feral/balance/guardian without Resto affinity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you will still be able to target mouseover macros using nameplates, seeing as you can do this without any addons. This is about breaking raid helpers that tell people where to stand. (e.g. the huge map with the dots and red/green line for the blade in Methods Xavius kill video)</div></div><hr />

The only thing I could hope or pray for is that it becomes a personal thing that's more akin to like a time trial to catch fish, rather than having entire guilds try to screw everyone else out of trying to win because they're guildie wants to try and win.</div></div><hr />

The first one is the ability you have, the second is triggered by using the ability.<br />

<br />
I was hoping with the pruning that it would create the ability to kite as a druid, similar to how it was in TBC. After seeing it wasn't and you basically have to bend over as a hard casting class instead of kiting away and controlling then hard casting.<br />
<br />
My second hope was the healing affinity would be a lot less then a healer but still decent healing. Wrong on that, the healing affinity blows. It would be nice if it was even half as efficient as how affliction healing is.</div></div><hr />
