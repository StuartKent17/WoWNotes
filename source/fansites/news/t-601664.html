Utgarde Keep Preview<br />
WoWinsider.com (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/08/03/first-impressions-wrath-of-the-lich-king-and-utgarde-keep/) posted a small preview of the Utgarde Keep (only playable in the press room). There isn't any major news (but it's still worth the reading) but there is a very interesting information here.<br />
&quot;We could not use our flying mounts in Northrend. But Blizzard has said they will be able to be used there, they just weren't in the build we played (and it made finding that darn keep even harder).&quot;<br />

Or is anyone pleased to see some non alien looking stuff here? I mean the whole Exodar/outerspace thing was great, but this really goes back to why I like Warcraft... WC3 Frozen Throne was probably the best RTS game I've played as far as story and art, and these models they are showing us are AWSOME.. And I'm SOOO glad we dont get the SAME DAMN RESKINNED OGRES! <br />
<br />
Blizz Developer #1: &quot;For WotLK we will just stretch this texture out hheeeree.. and make this red area blue....&quot;<br />
Blizz Developer #2: &quot;Oh yeah! That looks AWSOME.. and it's CHEAP!! The boss will LOVE that!&quot;<br />
The Boss &quot;Um.. No, we are going to listen to our fans this time. New textures.. NOW&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Fans &quot;Thank you god! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So happy to just not see the same damn Inn over and over again.</div></div><hr />
