World First Level 90<br />
You may remember that Fs was able to reach Level 90 before everyone else (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2940-Rob-Pardo-Interview-Level-90-World-First-Team-FS-Interview-Blue-Posts-Devs-Video) through some clever use of game mechanics, but Blizzard reset him to level 87. We finally got an update on this today when his achievement was restored!<br />
<br />
After some lengthy deliberation on this topic and evaluation of all facts, we’ve decided to overturn our decision on this matter. We will be re-instating Fs’s achievements. Our apologies to Fs for any frustration this has caused.<br />

Crowd Control and PvP<br />
With regards to crowd control, we don't really feel like there is too much of it, right now. We feel that CC is integral to PvP because without it battles simply become about tunneling and burst cooldowns. This is actually another situation where the question is touched on in a bit more detail in the &quot;Ask the Devs — The Answers&quot; blog which we plan to post tomorrow. So be sure to keep your eyes open for that <br />
<br />
Freezing trap, Sap and Gouge share the same DR. Same goes for Fear, Psychic Terror (Psyfiend fear) and the Blind disorient. Just wanted to mention that, but also that the developers briefly mention diminishing returns in the blog tomorrow as well. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259153-the-amount-of-cc-is-just-too-damn-high/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7339594356?page=2#21))<br />
<br />
Shado-Pan Trinket Changes<br />
It procs and i got 6900 agi for 40 seconds.. ??? <br />
This is actually just the tooltip not being updated yet as that requires a client patch. If you check your character sheet while in either Battlegrounds or Arena, you will see that the effect only applies 4400 Agility or Strength and the duration of the buff has been doubled. <br />
<br />
This effectively halves the burst potential of the trinket and doubles its duration. This results in the damage being much easier to heal, but lasts a longer amount of time. So this isn't actually a bug, it's an intended change, the tooltip for the buff just isn't updated yet.<br />
<br />
Btw nakatoir any reason you guys don't just remove it completely from pvp? <br />
Because that is not our intent. Our end goal is not to prohibit PvE gear in PvP, if it was, that is what we would do. There is actually a question about PvE items in PvP, in the upcoming &quot;Ask the Devs — The Answers&quot; blog. Keep an eye out for that as we plan for this to go live tomorrow.<br />
<br />
None wants Pve trinkets in PvP, NONE. Why even make it viable? 4k agility for 40 seconds is almost better then 20 seconds because certain hunter rogue healer comps only have 40 seconds games Don't forget that in 5.3, this trinket will also be getting scaled back to iLevel 496. This means that the stat proc will be getting lowered with the reduced iLevel and then halved as well when inside Battlegrounds and Arena. So in 5.3, the affect of this trinket will be diminished even further. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259140-shadopan-trinket-bug/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7339044382?page=1#13))<br />

Five Player Dungeons<br />
I love 5mans, always did, they just seem to fit perfectly with what I enjoy most about WoW, playing with a small group of friends that also happen to be very good players. For me this made heroic dungeons one of the most entertaining things about WoW ever since The Burning Crusade, followed only by Arenas and heroic Raiding. So on that regard, totally agree, I would love to see more (heroic) dungeons popping up, but I don't necessarily agree that they’re needed because of catching up issues.<br />
<br />
We’re aware that not everyone finds LFR entertaining, yet some of those players still run it for the drops, and of course… that’s not ideal. I mean, almost everyone enjoys the hunt for loot, it’s a big part of the MMORPG experience, but you should be having fun while doing it.<br />
This is where I believe heroic scenarios and challenge modes can make a difference, those players will (hopefully) become more inclined to run these instead of LFR. (Or in addition to LFR; as some players will always go where there is at least 1 loot upgrade for them no matter what, and that’s ok.)<br />
<br />
These rewards will have a higher ilvl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16758&amp;filter-ilvl-min=516&amp;filter-ilvl-max=516&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90) than current LFR gear (still subject to change). With the possibility for better rewards than LFR, I would expect to see skilled casual players choosing to do for example one challenge mode daily quest and one heroic scenario instead of an LFR wing.<br />
<br />
Also important to notice, Ghostcrawler recently said that devs are considering making heroic scenarios require a pre-made group.<br />
This is quite a change, and if that goes live I believe that we’re on the path for having content for just about every kind of player, new and casual players will have dungeons, dailies, LFR and Battlegrounds; casual (due to lack of time) but highly skilled players will have challenge modes, heroic scenarios and Arena/RBGs, and the more hardcore/highly skilled players will have normal and heroic raiding in addition to all the rest.<br />
<br />
So would 5mans still make sense? Of course, there will still be players that probably prefer 5mans to any other type of content but unfortunately with the current pace of development, we need to decide between raids and dungeons, because that’s the issue, they compete with each other in terms of resources, and while I think we can and should always try to improve on this, in both the efficiency and efficacy in which we produce content, I believe that right now most players still prefer to have more raiding content than dungeon content.<br />
<br />
We have dailies, heroic scenarios, challenge modes, LFR, crafting, BGs, RBGs and Arenas, all of these have the ability to provide more than enough gear to be able to start raiding (at least) on normal mode.<br />
<br />
There needs to be some progression too, we don’t want players to ding 90 and jump directly into ToT normal, but if you’re in a guild that has run previous raids and is just trying to fill some of the open raiding spots, you can afford to take slightly less geared players and still maintain an overall decent average raid ilvl. In the case of a new guild, you won’t have to wait too long before you step into ToT with all the options players have for gearing up that I’ve mentioned before, including previous raids.<br />
<br />
I would also question the argument for skipping content. I could understand it if you’re close to the end of an expansion and you want to see the latest content before it “expires”, but otherwise, you’re just skipping on a lot of entertainment value. Personally, I still am quite fond of those old Kara alt-runs even when we were doing BT with mains. Having a path that you have to follow to evolve your characters is a good thing, too much skipping just devalues content even faster, content that could otherwise be a source of great entertainment. Personally it makes me a bit sad inside to see all that old content being somehow wasted away, what was once the glory and jewel of each of the previous expansions’ PvE content shines now somehow a little less bright and has devalued in a way that makes it almost obsolete, I only wish we could one day make all that content available for everyone to experience again the way it was designed to be experienced in a seamless fashion. Oh well, blues can get nostalgic and dream too you know.<br />
<br />
I'm quite excited to see how heroic scenarios will turn out, and also for the changes being applied to the challenge mode rewards, I'm hoping to see a lot of players running both of these, and I will for sure be one of them.

He is playing other characters, that's kinda normal, that you rush Realm First on char you can do it easiest, then you level up your real main and do whatever you want, since shared Achievements shows that you are Realm First lvl 90 on any character.</div></div><hr />

Why even make it viable? 4k agility for 40 seconds is almost better then 20 seconds because certain hunter rogue healer comps only have 40 seconds games Don't forget that in 5.3, this trinket will also be getting scaled back to iLevel 496. This means that the stat proc will be getting lowered with the reduced iLevel and then halved as well when inside Battlegrounds and Arena. So in 5.3, the affect of this trinket will be diminished even further<br />

PvP was supposed to be a side thing in WoW. You might as well continue to treat it as such because I don't think it will ever be balanced enough to people's liking. haha.</div></div><hr />

Well their ill fated attempts to change the game to make PvP work failed utterly, the changes in Cataclysm only made the game stupid. From jump the shark health pools to the idiot idea of shouldering the burden of changes to healers by wrecking their coefficients post 80. Completely ignoring the fact the reason for the burst was the same reason people face rolled early 5 mans, gear is pure monty hall. How could players not expect to face roll when their gear nearly twice the strength as it was at an expansions release? Cata tried to fix it but only drove people away.<br />
<br />
Then comes MOP, and what? They are still ignoring gear as a source of their problems? Yet health pools are beyond that of bosses? Hell we have grubs with more health than some bosses in Wrath :P When one piece of gear at 90 is better than a level 80 character fully equipped their might be a problem.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I've completely forgotten about it. I clicked the link and saw that vid I remember watching what seems like ages ago. I can't be bothered to re-watch it though, so I'll just remain in the dark. Incidentally, I also hate watching vids - everything has to be on a vid nowadays. :(<br />

I'm also not sure why this is frontpage news, why Fs or this Athene guy deserve any kind of special attention, but nonetheless I'm happy for Fs, whoever he is, and if he still is playing. :)</div></div><hr />

i hate the brutal fact that gear gets downgraded :( , rather face stronger mobs than self-nerfing<br />

And besides its not popular enough (at least) on my realm to run it. Only seen gold sellers selling gold runs and thats it, so far havent seen anyone actually lfm challenge modes<br />

Emm kind of confused what you want then...<br />
<br />
You want all the things that challenge modes offer.<br />
<br />
But you want mobs to scale up not gear down.<br />
<br />
You know that is technically a lot more challenging right, how would you scale mobs if you had a 530 geared tank and a 463 geared healer for example? I think your getting pretty picky tbh.<br />
<br />
And you want them to be popular. Does the fact they are not popular tell you something?<br />
<br />
Or are you telling me you think the main reason Challenge modes are not popular is that the gear scales down and the mobs don't scale up?</div></div><hr />

Well, would you have continued to play if you had been treated like this? He did not exploit, he did not cheat ... the 2-10th ones all did something similar but did not get stripped of levels and achievements ... For sure I'd not have played again. In fact this &quot;treatment&quot; drove me away from wow, too. (played with Fs since 2006).<br />
It is nice that it took them only 6 months to agree they were wrong, but this isn't a victory ... it is simply things set straight and that way too late. Blizzard is dead to me. Wildstar for the win!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now they're restoring the achievement to him? Why on earth are Blizzard discussing a matter of an achievement from when MoP was launched? How can such a matter take seven months to discuss? I don't suppose they've given him a refund equal to the extra time he had to grind from 87-90 again? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blaiz</div><div class="date">2013-04-19, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And now they're restoring the achievement to him? Why on earth are Blizzard discussing a matter of an achievement from when MoP was launched? How can such a matter take seven months to discuss? I don't suppose they've given him a refund equal to the extra time he had to grind from 87-90 again? <br />
I think it's fair to assume it was mentioned a few times, possibly one of those things that just sits at the of meeting agendas. Someone finally said let's restore the achievement, no one objected so there we have it. <br />
<br />
A much more plausible suggestion than it being the &quot;The hot topic&quot; for debate for the past six months. As for a refund it would only have taken several hours to level from 87-90, that's not even a Euro of game time. Anyway whether Fs got any form of compensation as either time or ingame reward is between them and Blizzard, it doesn't affect us in the slightest.<br />
<br />
For the record I don't understand why the achievement was ever removed, if someone wants to go all out for something that means little to everyone else in the World (and of Warcraft) then let them. If they used clever mechanics which let's face it anyone chasing these firsts will do then so long as it isn't blatent exploitation or required use of a bot then it's legitimate.</div></div><hr />

For the record, it was pretty shitty to have it taken away from him. And I'm glad he has it back. I don't think he quit playing though. I think he just plays other toons, maybe?</div></div><hr />

I don't know. If you're raising a topic that was worthwhile seven months ago you really have run out of topics to discuss at the meeting. I highly doubts it's just a &quot;hey, lets vote on bringing the achievement back to this player&quot;. <br />
<br />
Alright, you punish the player by setting him back three levels and remove the achievement. That is one thing. But to add insult to injury you suddenly and out of the blue decide to restore the achievement seven months later? I'd feel downright provoked if I was in Fs' place. From what I can see from his account achievements he has stopped playing. Now Blizzard is basically saying that they reverse the whole thing and expect that a &quot;We're sorry&quot; will do. <br />

It's not about the refund itself. It's about how the person is first told that what he has done is wrong and punished for it. You then suddenly decide that it's not wrong but you're not compensating him for the fact that you admittedly screwed up big time.<br />
I'd sure as hell like to know if he was compensated. I'd like to know if Blizzard will actually compensate players they punish wrongfully. In that way it does actually concern the player base and it would suit Blizzard and its PR.<br />

<br />
What this is about is that Blizzard has just shown that even though you've done something wrongful and might be subject to punishment for this, it may not be wrong after a few months and they'll change their mind. You've still been punished though. So basically you're getting punished for something others might not be, even though they've done the exact same thing. <br />

It's the idea that their stuff can just as easily be taken from them for no reason and therefore to not want to associate with such things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want all the things that challenge modes offer.<br />
<br />
But you want mobs to scale up not gear down.<br />
<br />
You know that is technically a lot more challenging right, how would you scale mobs if you had a 530 geared tank and a 463 geared healer for example? I think your getting pretty picky tbh.<br />
<br />
And you want them to be popular. Does the fact they are not popular tell you something?<br />
<br />
Or are you telling me you think the main reason Challenge modes are not popular is that the gear scales down and the mobs don't scale up?<br />
<br />
im just saying its not popular enough and i personally dont like how gear scales down, nothing more. Back in tbc everyone was like LFM daily heroic, just wanted that feeling back. Maybe the game has changed too much after all and it couldnt be like the way it was anymore</div></div><hr />

Seriously, it's not that hard to figure out why people don't run them.<br />
<br />
You get dress up gear. Who cares about that stuff when you can go transmog anything esp when the sets are not even that cool.<br />
<br />
People like to run hard shit and actually get a reward and a sense of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
I loved running heroics in BC because they were difficult. I have zero desire to run a challenge made for no stat dress up gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syrus-JI</div><div class="date">2013-04-19, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wish Blizzard would get off this whole thing with 5-man dungeons competing for resources with raids. Nevermind the fact that they should have enough money to employ two fully staffed teams to create good content for both (which they should)... They don't even need to create totally new 5-mans, they just need to use what they've already created more effectively. Here's how:<br />
<br />
1. Make all current heroic 5-mans normal mode (since they aren't heroic in difficulty anyways), keep the same current rewards, and keep them in the LFD system.<br />
<br />
2. Create a tuned up version of all current 5-man dungeons to an actual Heroic mode (Challenge mode difficulty or higher), have it reward the same drops from LFR including Legendary quest items and more Valor, and remove from the LFD tool. Each patch bump up the difficulty in proportion to the increased ilevels of gear, and change loot to the next LFR tier level.<br />
<br />
3. Keep Challenge modes in for people who aren't annoyed by timed runs and want the transmog/bragging rights.<br />
<br />
Now you have made a ton more people happy who want challenging 5-man content, but don't like the race/timed aspect of Challenge modes. You have added back to the sense of server community since people actually have to speak to each other to form heroic groups, and you have given people who hate LFR a way to get the same items without having to run it. LFR is now purely a way to &quot;experience the raid content&quot; for people who don't like normal raids, which was the stated purpose of it in the first place. The above places almost no additional development stress on the team, is sustainable, and takes nothing away from players who already enjoy the current system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2013-04-19, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also question the argument for skipping content. I could understand it if you’re close to the end of an expansion and you want to see the latest content before it “expires”, but otherwise, you’re just skipping on a lot of entertainment value. Personally, I still am quite fond of those old Kara alt-runs even when we were doing BT with mains. Having a path that you have to follow to evolve your characters is a good thing, too much skipping just devalues content even faster, content that could otherwise be a source of great entertainment. Personally it makes me a bit sad inside to see all that old content being somehow wasted away, what was once the glory and jewel of each of the previous expansions’ PvE content shines now somehow a little less bright and has devalued in a way that makes it almost obsolete, I only wish we could one day make all that content available for everyone to experience again the way it was designed to be experienced in a seamless fashion. Oh well, blues can get nostalgic and dream too you know.<br />
<br />
For the &quot;skipping out on entertainment&quot; part: That is how it's always been.<br />
<br />
I started playing sometime in 2006, but I didn't &quot;get serious&quot; until sometime around the Sunwell patch. I enjoyed raiding in Karazhan with my new guild, but I was unhappy, among other things, to lose out on the attunement titles because I'd been late to the party. When Wrath of the Lich King was announced, I promised myself that I would not lose out on content during that expansion like I had in classic WoW and TBC - and I kept it.<br />
<br />
I was especially happy when tier-skipping was introduced in WotLK, as I personally felt it to be a huge QoL change. No more having to run outdated raid content just to get to the next one! And around that time I was also becoming an &quot;altoholic&quot;, so it was a major plus for my other characters and not just my main.<br />
<br />
But now... I don't see any &quot;replay&quot; value here. Sure, Blizzard is plenty guilty of stretching out content and who could blame them for that? It's just with Mists of Pandaria, there's no &quot;icing&quot; to dress up said stretched content. My goodness, it seems as if Diablo III bled over into World of Warcraft in some respects! (Those of you who have played both games should know what I'm talking about.)<br />
<br />
With a final note to Taepsilum, I give you this old quote from no one else but Mr. Crab himself when he was responding to another post commenting on how tier-skipping was handled:<br />
I'm not sure you feel this way, but typically the response is &quot;I walked uphill in the snow, so they should have to as well.&quot; You got to the content first. You were showing off your tier set and Shadowmourne in Dalaran before those others guys. Why does it matter if they will eventually be able to catch up to you (especially since you'll pull ahead again the second a new raid is available)? The alternative is saying that those players should want to run through every raid tier before they can hit the new stuff, but I can tell you that whether or not they want to (and many don't) the facts suggest that they never finish and give up on raiding. <br />
<br />
We're not really trying to keep Black Temple or Sunwell alive at this point, and by the same token, we're okay if Naxx has basically been reduced to achievements or weekly raid quests. It had its time in the sun. We don't need to prop it up forever. <br />
<br />
<br />
Darn shame Blizzard changed their mind in this regard.</div></div><hr />

From what I can see in his achievements he has stopped playing on that account. Not that I blame him<br />
<br />
I totally agree with you about the poor way this was handled, the damage was done months ago and doing this now kind of adds insult to injury. Hitting 90 legitimately so quickly didn't give Fs any advantage, they most likely just went to bed through tiredness along with the obvious lack of four other people to run heroics with. As stated it doesn't even look like Fs has played since it happened, certainly not on that character. Blizzard will be able to tell whether or not the account is inactive but reinstating an achievement on a frozen account would be utterly pointless. If they haven't been back for six months then I doubt you could pay them to come back, I hope that is the case since they've taken the moral high ground on this one.<br />
<br />
As for compensation in general I'm fairly sure they do reward some once they admit to being at fault, most likely something cosmetic like a mount or pet along with any game time that may have been lost. So in reality it doesn't cost them a penny, the time was already paid for by the player and the pet/mount is just pixels that one would think they'd already have bought had they wanted it. There's no reason though for Blizzard to say how they deal with individual cases, it may be seen as good PR and applauded by some but it'll also draw criticism from other sections of the community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
U make a group within ur realm or cross realm then u fly to the dungeon, use the summon stone n zone in, like how its done in BC. Requiring proper CC on pulls n stuff and mobs actually hit hard even if u are raid geared but still doable for dungeon/LFR geared players just slightly more difficult for them.<br />
<br />
Requiring ppl actually need to L2P n have the realm reputation thing back again<br />
<br />
This is an awesome idea. Blizzard should hire this guy. They could call it Challenging Situation, or Challenge Method or something I dunno.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eleveneleven</div><div class="date">2013-04-20, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">clever use of game mechanics<br />
<br />
aka exploits of code weaknesses, gaming the mechanics against their clear intentions, and in general playing against the spirit of the design and pace of the content<br />
<br />
The race has and will always be who can find the most effective weaknesses in Blizzard's code before they patch them. It has NEVER and will never be able who can actually race through content the quickest.<br />
<br />
Imagine if sports were like that. Each team trying to find ways around the rules so that at the end of the game (or season if they save the most damaging exploits for the championships) they have to change the rules for next season. This is why I ignore e-sports in general. It's always about trying to break the code instead of playing the fucking game. People want to see it legitimized and televised in more places besides Korea? QUIT. CHEATING.</div></div><hr />
