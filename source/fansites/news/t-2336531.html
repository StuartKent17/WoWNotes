<br />
Developer Interviews<br />
We're continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews.<br />
<br />
Kotaku Discusses PVP with Devs<br />
Kotaku (https://kotaku.com/blizzards-plan-to-take-wows-world-pvp-back-to-its-glory-1820311638) talked about the new PVP decisions with the WoW Devs.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new World PVP system allows all players to experience PVP if they want.<br />
Ion admits that the team hasn’t done a very good job in terms of World PVP and are looking to breathe new life into it with BfA.<br />
World PVP can never be 100% fair, but the pace and combat can be worked on.<br />
The team is looking into implementing the level scaling feature into World PVP as well.<br />
The team doesn’t want the sense of progression to be lost in World PVP by using the PVP templates.<br />
<br />
WoWChakra Interviews Shani Edwards and Ray Cobo<br />
WoWChakra (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5FnvzHBs64) sat down with two of WoW’s game producers.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5FnvzHBs64?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The Artifact Weapon sendoff will take place just before the expansion.<br />
There are some preliminary requirements to starting the quest chains for Allied races - such as getting exalted with highmountain tauren before you can proceed.<br />
There might be some story for the Void Elves in 7.3.5.<br />
The alliance will get to experience an epic story involving Jaina and where she has been.<br />
Jaina will have some family problems in the expansion.<br />
”Sneaky Pete” is a rogue Island AI character that likes to wait until you engage mobs to attack you. He is a jerk.<br />
The team is hoping to start beta early next year.<br />
The goal is to have Battle for Azeroth launched in 2018.<br />
<br />
<br />
BlizzPro at the World of Warcraft Press Conference<br />
BlizzPro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZv_Ln9dFdg) released a video of their visit to the World of Warcraft Press conference.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZv_Ln9dFdg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Other examples of Island consumables could be group “thorns” or ways to bounce mobs between each other to stun lock them.<br />
The Island AI will also hit harder than normal mobs.<br />
Some Island scenarios, mobs and abilities may only appear on higher difficulties.<br />
PVP Island Expeditions might not activate all of your PVP abilities.<br />
Professions also come into play for Island Expeditions - a miner can mine Azerite nodes faster around the islands.<br />
The emissary system might influence the way Island Expeditions are done.<br />
The team likes the idea that you build up a bank of content to do (such as emissaries) and want to use it on more features.<br />
The team likes that there will be synergy choices with the different slots of the Heart of Azeroth.<br />
Higher item level gear’s abilities may have higher Azerite level requirements to unlock.<br />
Warfront events, commanders and AI choices are all random.<br />
Communities are not replacing guilds. They are simply giving players the ability to have a variety of communities in game outside of their guild.<br />
The goal is for players to be in as many communities as they want.<br />
End game raiding in BfA will play out much like Legion.<br />
A lot of old pet models were updated including chickens and cats.<br />
There is a new cat model that is fat and fuzzy.<br />
The stat squish numbers are open to player feedback.<br />
Battle for Azeroth includes a character boost.<br />
<br />
<br />

Moonkin Festival Micro-Holiday on November 12<br />
Moonkin Festival (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Moonkin_Festival) is on Sunday! Head to Moonglade and pick up Moonkin Monitoring (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/47430-moonkin-monitoring) from Makkaw (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/122134-makkaw).<br />
<br />
There is a small quest line that ends with a fight against a group boss that drops Beanie Boomie (http://www.wowdb.com/items/150740-beanie-boomie). Completion of the quest line increases the number of hatchlings that are following you.<br />
<br />
Join the celebration of all things Moonkin in Moonglade, November 12!<br />
<br />

<br />
A new addition to Legion is what we’re calling micro-holidays. Each one is meant to make the world feel more alive without making players feel like they need to participate for big rewards—while still providing some more variety and fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
HeroStorm - Episode 31: Within Arms Length<br />
Another episode of HeroStorm has been released. <br />

<br />
If I'm understanding right, the only thing we'll have is a possibility of a void elves story, the raid, and a pre-launch patch. That is NOT a year of content....That is MAYBE a couple of months, more likely a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Since I have ridiculously weird work times, I am only able to do LFR, and LFR won't be fully open until half way through January. I might as well turn off WoW until then, resub just long enough to see the fights, and shut it down again.</div></div><hr />

The team likes the idea that you build up a bank of content to do (such as emissaries) and want to use it on more features.<br />
<br />
This is great, but please please get rid of the paragon reputation system. When I am exalted with a faction I want to be done so I can focus on a new part of the game instead of having to go back and do the same content throughout the whole expansion. I am exalted with you, you envy me, I shouldnt have to keep working for you and pray to rng to get your shiny mount. :(</div></div><hr />

they are expecting it - possibly thats why they didnt release preorders during blizzcon <br />
<br />
if i had to bet they will do another &quot;1 year sub &quot; possibly with destiny 2 in bundle like they did with diablo 3 ?<br />

<br />
I’ve noticed that there are some weapon drops from rares and from the invasions, i really hope these aren’t what we’re expected to use.<br />
<br />
It would make more sense for their artifact essence if you will be removed at the pre-expansion event and the artifact become an epic locked at the item level you have reached.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the person who said this is probably Shani. No offense to her but she's in way over her head. Look her up on LinkedIn, she's a glorified receptionist working as a game producer who has no knowledge of the gaming industry in development, design, or archtecture (network, system etc.) Most of the people who are doing the interviews really have no idea what they are at Blizzard. Take it with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uncle</div><div class="date">2017-11-12, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do they realise their ideas are crap on top of crap? This new expansion is gonna be worse than Wod. Lorewise, Horde Vs Alliance is DEAD since Wotlk, stop wanting to bring back that non-sense because you have no idea and no talent. <br />
The characters will be bad writen, like always, especialy Jaina who is a traitor to Kul'tiras for murdering her own father, who was the ruler of Kul'tiras, she should have been executed at sight, but no, like always with Blizzard: NOTHING will never have any consequences: Jaina is still alive and is poorly writen (but when you have Christie Golden, the worst writter who ever worked for Blizzard, it's not surprising), so, she's not evil, but simply flawed, yeah yeah, by the way, why did she wasn't here at the final battle between Alliance and Gul'dan on the Broken Shore? You know, the cinematic where she was NOT here? And how about her many crimes in Mop? And how about her treason in Legion when she turned away from her allies because she was bitching around?<br />
<br />
Oh but she was flawed ! Sorry, after all, you only have 40 years, it's not like you could be an adult ! Let's forget all your past crimes and take a new journey together !<br />
<br />
Even that unjustified war betwen Horde and Alliance will end with &quot;oh, the Horde attacked us a second time in 5 years, but no ! We will not learn the lesson this time and destroy it for good, but in place, we will magicaly forget everything and do has is nothing happened !&quot;.<br />
<br />
And what about the allied races? WHY the Nightborn join the Horde instead of the Alliance? Because of the Blood Elves? So what? You will make a race who was helped by BOTH faction turn against one of them JUST after that? &quot;You will have quests to explain that&quot;, oh yeah, 3 quests who will say &quot;Nightborn join the Horde, kktx bye Alliance&quot;.<br />
Everyone know i speak right, this is exactly how it will be.<br />
<br />
And i don't speak about the &quot;lightforged&quot; draenei, whose model is absolutly disgusting: their skin color is same has a corpse, they speak like robots, their eyes are ugly, their face is, well, i don't even know how to describe such a design failure.<br />
Whatever, they should not even join the Alliance, because after the Legion lost, Draenei should LEAVE Azeroth for ever, this is not their world, they were never part of the Alliance, only allies, and only to fight the Burning Legion, that all, they are not friends, they don't have anything in common; draenei should even become non-playable race after Legion, because their story is over, for good.<br />
Bring the lightforged is simply non-sense.<br />
<br />
And let's talk about the &quot;void elf&quot;, seriously? Who though that would be a good idea? This is the dumbest idea EVER, this is clearly the proof that Blizzard doesn't know what to do, and they decided to launch a full scale retarded expansion.<br />
<br />
Oh, and why those &quot;allied races&quot; will be recruited? Oh yes, only to fight in a non-sense war who isn't even their, great ! Hozen vs Jinuy 2, Mop 2 incoming, with the dumbest ideas ever used in Wow, i can assure you Blizzard, you will regret to behave has if your customers were morons, they are not, they didn't forgot Wod, they will not forgive you the next crap you want to throw at us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good talk. Great arguments. Also, Nightborne join the Horde because Blood Elves have had similar issues in the past (mana addiction, becoming withered, corruption from the Legion) and there's dialogue where the Nightborne show interest in the Horde.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, my guess is in 8.0 during the pre-expansion event. Ability changes are usually in place then which are then built around not having artfifacts. So we'll probably get a stronger ilvl weapon in return.</div></div><hr />

”Sneaky Pete” is a rogue Island AI character that likes to wait until you engage mobs to attack you. He is a jerk. &lt;- It sounds like the &quot;advanced AI&quot; as they call it will be checking for certain player conditionals. Like think of the different load conditions/triggers that weakauras has. Probably nothing too fancy but that's my guess</div></div><hr />

<br />
There it is. There's always one thing per expansion that Ion says they didn't do a good job with, I was starting to worry about him. <br />
<br />
Hey Ion, here's a hint: World PvP just happens. It's organic. Players invented Tarren Mill/Crossroads. But you killed it - and continue to kill it over-managing the player's experience and micro-managing everything. Let players breathe. Let some areas allow WPVP and don't nerf it. If it's impacting the server, find a way to shard it. ALLOW it, and don't try to design/micro-manage it. It was something your company didn't even put on the box, because players came up with it. Templates won't make it happen, WPVP isn't about gear or rewards, it was just for fun. Fun, you know that thing you and your team have so much trouble with? <br />
<br />
It's like the dueling spots that players created, like out in front of Ironforge. Leave it alone. It's the players. They made it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You shouldnt find excuses at this point. The Horde in WoW never made sense. Sophisticated elves from Silvermoon in an alliance with a horde of orcs and trolls, the races they fought bloody wars with within lifetime. The Forsaken, a bunch of undead freed from the Lich King? Among the same elves who they butchered with Arthas? In this mmo every race has to be shoved into one of the factions and it destroyed the lore from previous stories in Warcraft. Thats why i never played horde, because seeing undead and elves in Orgrimmar is immersion breaking. Now that the old night elves are joining the whole thing is even more nonsensical, and the fact that the orcs' warchief is an undead woman...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tbf, I can see the point. <br />
If one of BfA's main selling point, new races, requires a pretty dull grind with a faction from the LAST expansion... That's pretty, atleast in my opinion, stupid. For new players, it essentially means that a couple of these allied races(I believe there was talk of the same thing for Nightborne, having to be exalted and maybe complete the entire storyline there as well. Lightforged Draenei requiring Army of Light exalted) won't have their questlines available to them. <br />
This would be a problem for longtime players who have kept to a faction as well. Think someone on Alliance just wants to try and make a highmountain tauren, see the racials, perhaps enjoy the customisation. Well damn, guess they'll have to not only level their hordie character from scratch(which, tbf, this is a given concidering the questlines are faction specific!), but then also grind rep ontop of it. Or hey, since a suggestion was Lightforged Draenei requiring Army of Light, enjoy spending yet MORE time on Argus after what's looking to be a year of Antorus, repgrinding Army of the Light on the alliance character you didn't have before the expansion.<br />
I'm not talking about the making the races just being readily available but the questlines to unlock these things, the storylines that were touted on blizzcon as a natural way to have the races go to their factions, shouldn't be behind Legion rep grinds.<br />
<br />
My suggestion on this note is: No rep grind, but complete their respective storylines in the zones, for those that need it. Or, if they ARE so insistant on this rep grind for some of the allied races... have it, you know... be like &quot;have atleast one character exalted with them&quot;, or have the account-wide rep achievements.</div></div><hr />

THis is true, definately. But concidering they ALSO try to get, you know, fresh blood in, I say it again, I feel as though it's a stupid decision.<br />
And again, opposite faction players. Sure, at this point in time, I can start properly rep grinding my blood elf with the Nightborn and Highmountain factions... yet again, ooor, they could just look at my main, go &quot;Hey, this guy's exalted with the required reps, good enough.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I get that its obvious we will still have a big bad probably n'zoth at the end and azshara already confirmed for 2ed tier. But its just odd how those are not the focus and instead its like the focus is on the side task.</div></div><hr />

People seem to think that the Bad guys are lined up so as soon as one of them falls, another one is instantly there to start shit going. It's nice to see how the factions react to the lull between threats and isn't surprising to me that the &quot;big bad&quot; will slowly make itself a bigger threat as the expansion goes on. Otherwise you get that shitty feeling like in Wrath of the Lich King where Arthas was in your face during the leveling experience then suddenly &quot;Oh we are fighting Dragons and Old gods&quot; then a year and a half later he's just appears all &quot;MUAHAHHA NOW YOU CAN FIGHT ME CHAMPION!&quot;<br />

Blizzard made the newbie storyteller mistake as they put relatively quickly more and more powerful enemies and almost all of them just burned the whole world...Just imagine after the 2. World War, then events from 28 days later, then events from Independence Day, then events from Terminator (the war, not the movie itself) then the remaining alive beings starts a 3. World War....Sounds legit...For me that`s why it`s bloody stupid..Both Horde and Alliance think and acts as one all the fucking time...that`s ridiculuos Noone, not even a single race raise it`s voice against the decisions or turn against the so called allies..(like elves against dwarves, or gnomes against humans, or taurens against forsaken...forsaken is one of the biggest mistakes anyway in my eyes...Orcs - proud folks, Taurens - deep connection with nature...and they forming an ally with the Forsaken which is an abomination in the natural circle (born-live-die) <br />
<br />

It's actually pretty in line with our Human history.<br />
<br />
Take America and Russia. Very much large Factions in their own rights, ran much differently. Both became &quot;Allies&quot; too fight a greater threat in the World Wars. Both also then became antagonistic to each other for the Years following and always seem to be at odds to each. Yet you could pretty much guarantee if a War broke out with an Enemy that threaten both Russia and America that they would tenuously join Forces again until the threat was over.<br />
<br />
Even Sylvanas turning on a supposed Ally isn't strange in our History. Just look at Modern War history of real-life and you will found countless COUNTLESS times in the last 100 years alone where Countries have allied and fought eachother multiple times.<br />
<br />
I guess the younger crowd that haven't experienced much of life think that when countries become friends they stay permanently friends and that all living sapient creatures want the same things in their lives. So a story of Betrayal, Conflict and War seems odd.<br />

Good examples..ohh wait no..how much time was between the 2 World War? (1. ended in 1918, 2. started 1939....21 years....not 2 months like in WoW) The casualties were enormous...what do you think how many people died in BC as military person, in LK as innocent bystander AND military person during the campaign, in Cata as innocent folks AND military person, in MoP as military person (and as innocent pandarian...they numbers can`t be high anyway as it`s just an island...) and in Legion as innocent folk and military person? How the hell can they replace the losses? Within weeks or months?<br />
Second..please tell me when was the last time when ANY race went against the faction decision?<br />
Third: Your example in WoW terms like 2 big countries go against a 3rd...not a whole continent against another continent..or worlds against worlds...Independence Day is a good emulation of LEgion..powerful enemy attacks, we won in the end, but the price, the casualties are tremendous...<br />
Fourth: The marked section: Huhh? Sylvanas and our history? What? When Sylvanas turned against her allies? Especially in OUR history? Did you realised that`s my issue it`s never happened? The player characters are basically soldiers of fortune (doing jobs aka quests for rewards....) or adventurers in fantasy terms...Why the hell do they need to follow the mainstream politics?</div></div><hr />

Guilds are people who run under the same tag in realms. <br />
<br />
Communities are just group of people who have something in common with each other. They might be real life friends, old guild mates, speak the same language. <br />

Yes yes, I don't think anyone is denying that now. It is the turn of events wich is kinda strange. <br />
<br />
Both were there fighting for them. Now they fight alongside the Horde? I love the Horde!(little Zul'jin makeover here). <br />
They are more Night Elf heritage than High Elf, High elves(Blood Elves) were also in fact a long standing member of the Alliance. Recent lore has changed that, doesn't mean that people don't think that is kinda weird.<br />

If you flag yourself for pvp you will only see other people flagged for pvp. Sounds dedicated to me. You're currently sharded on a zone basis off of your server type so nothing is changing there. This is just allowing more people to either opt in or opt out of pvp in a more convenient fashion than server transferring or rerolling.</div></div><hr />

I wish they would have just made it so you got new skins and abilities based on the next expansion for your AW.<br />

it doesn't say &quot;end of 2018&quot; though. Since they talked a lot about content drought during Legion, i highly doubt they will let another one like during Siege of Orgrimmar hit the game again.</div></div><hr />

That would force people starting with BfA to grind Legion first to unlock and optimize the Artifact Weapon, that's not what they want. That's why they approximately never keep anything from one expansion to the next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I’ve noticed that there are some weapon drops from rares and from the invasions, i really hope these aren’t what we’re expected to use.<br />
<br />
It would make more sense for their artifact essence if you will be removed at the pre-expansion event and the artifact become an epic locked at the item level you have reached.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rare weapons in Argus are for transmog. purposes. They will probably make Artifacts unusable at the start of the exp. (since some of their talents and such will be integrated in to the specs.) and go &quot;here is your replacement&quot; and give us a rare weapon at the starting quest. Or we will keep using them till we get a better one (a quest blue perhaps, retarded i know) but they will be empty husks since their power will be used for whatever.</div></div><hr />

While I understand that and have repeatedly understood that ever since it was announced and will no doubt be told it again, I will not be paying for something I don't like and didn't have to put up with before. If WoW was F2P it would be different, I might put up with changes like this. But there's money involved here and that makes a massive amount of difference. I am not paying a sub for something that is forced on me that I don't like. And I will go somewhere else that I do like and so will my sub money for a dedicated PVP-only non sharded non-flaggable server. Sharding has already gone crazy enough as it is. I'm looking around elsewhere. It's not like before. There's more options now. I might unsub just to wait for Classic. And there are other games I play now as well. PVP-centric games. They are more than welcome to my sub money. With a big smile on my face at this point.</div></div><hr />

I’ve even accidentally tab targeted players of the opposite faction while killing WQ mobs &amp; they still won’t attack back if it’s a player of equal level. World PvP hasn’t been a thing for years &amp; the only reason anyone is upset over the change is they know the lowbies will have it toggled off so they can level in peace. You can’t gank &amp; grave camp lowbies anymore. Oh the horror. Pardon me for having no sympathy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There it is. There's always one thing per expansion that Ion says they didn't do a good job with, I was starting to worry about him. <br />
<br />
Hey Ion, here's a hint: World PvP just happens. It's organic. Players invented Tarren Mill/Crossroads. But you killed it - and continue to kill it over-managing the player's experience and micro-managing everything. Let players breathe. Let some areas allow WPVP and don't nerf it. If it's impacting the server, find a way to shard it. ALLOW it, and don't try to design/micro-manage it. It was something your company didn't even put on the box, because players came up with it. Templates won't make it happen, WPVP isn't about gear or rewards, it was just for fun. Fun, you know that thing you and your team have so much trouble with? <br />
<br />
It's like the dueling spots that players created, like out in front of Ironforge. Leave it alone. It's the players. They made it.<br />
<br />
Have you even done wPvP in Legion or are you just spouting generic complaints? TM vs SS was because nothing else existed. WPvP doesn't happen in Legion because people can one-shot each other, raiders reign supreme.<br />
<br />
Now what I'm actually excited about: PvP level scaling! I doubt it will reach longer than the zone's limitation but it would be cool if the lower player was boosted to the other player's level, or vice versa.</div></div><hr />
