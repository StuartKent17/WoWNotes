Rob Pardo Interview<br />
Rob Pardo was at Unite this year and gave an interview to gamesindustry.biz (http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-10-08-games-arent-really-supposed-to-be-easy-at-all-times), with a little bit of World of Warcraft talk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Adding obstacles that have the right amount of frustration and challenge is important so that when the player overcomes them, it feels like a huge accomplishment or achievement.<br />
In the quest to make World of Warcraft more accessible, understandable, and intuitive, some of the sharp edges were shaved away. <br />
Those sharp edges were sometimes part of what made the game compelling, as games aren't really supposed to be easy at all times.<br />
Everything in game design is about trade-offs. You can't make a game that everyone will love.<br />
The initial design for WoW was trying to get players that enjoyed Blizzard games to try a MMO.<br />
There was debate about putting awesome content, encounters, and stories in dungeons, as there were players that enjoyed playing by themselves and didn't want to group up for dungeons. <br />
The choice not to make a single player version of dungeons was intentional, as making it more accessible would cause players that love dungeons to love them less. <br />
Hearthstone was an experiment that looked at making a Blizzard quality game with a smaller team and it worked out well.<br />
Pardo is closer towards the end of his sabbatical than the beginning.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Is the Berserk for Mythic Iskar 8 minutes or 9 or trigger? Getting conflicting reports.<br />
Should be 8 minutes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/651163603249160194))<br />
<br />
Any plans to make [Only the Penitent...] for Firelands meta soloable?<br />
Player power trivializes some old raid achievements, but for others, coordinating multiple players is the entire point. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/651163810607161345))<br />
<br />
Why aren't the ICC 5 man in the timewalking rotation?<br />
It’s definitely a popular request. Timewalking is a feature we want to continue to update and expand in the future. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/651164031005294592))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
the lesser rings in the leg. quest can be used in pvp why cant the legendary ring be used in pvp? Doesnt say it cant in quests<br />
The item’s proc does not trigger while in PvP combat and the ring is scaled down to item level like other non-PvP gear. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/651164712772612098))<br />
<br />
Hey, would it be possible to make vendors sell old Elite Gladiator gear to players with 2000+ current rating? #Warcraft<br />
No plans for this. Elite gear sets are only available during that particular season. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/651165100468912129))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
a little bird told me: arakkoas are androgynous. Is it canon?<br />
They are male/female and can tell each other apart just fine. Adventurer's untrained eye would be unable to see difference. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/651096234313121792))<br />

Rift - Patch 3.4: Into the Wilds<br />
Rift released a new patch (http://forums.riftgame.com/general-discussions/patch-notes/471554-rift-3-4-into-wilds.html) last week, along with a new calling: The Primalist (http://www.trionworlds.com/rift/en/2015/09/09/rift-3-4-spotlight-into-the-primalist/). They also released a guide for returning players (http://www.trionworlds.com/rift/en/2015/10/07/returning-to-rift/) covering what has changed.<br />

Is this a problem of difficulty or one of accessibility?<br />
I would imagine a little bit of both. Mythic raiding guilds are generally focused on progression, and not achievements. I know that my guild is about a 50/50 split in terms of who cares about achievements. In fact, it might be more than half that just don't give a flying fuck about them. Which is a little disappointing to me, since I would indeed love to get some of those achievements, but that's not why we're there. We're there to kill bosses and progress, not go back to old bosses and farm achievements. Sure, the top guilds who have had clears for months can go back and do it, but that is a very small percentage of the playerbase.<br />
<br />

Mythic raiding guilds are generally focused on progression, and not achievements. I know that my guild is about a 50/50 split in terms of who cares about achievements. In fact, it might be more than half that just don't give a flying fuck about them. Which is a little disappointing to me, since I would indeed love to get some of those achievements, but that's not why we're there. We're there to kill bosses and progress, not go back to old bosses and farm achievements. Sure, the top guilds who have had clears for months can go back and do it, but that is a very small percentage of the playerbase.<br />

If you click through to the article, it makes sense. Here is the full paragraph. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Even with dungeons, we had a lot of debate inside the studio about the dungeons that had this really awesome content and really cool encounters and some of the best story lines and quest lines. You'd get quests in your log that drive you to the dungeon, but we had a lot of players that really enjoyed playing the game by themselves and didn't want to be in groups. There's a big push inside the studio from some of those folks that, 'Hey, can't you make a single player version of these dungeons?' That was an example where we chose to not make it more accessible because we felt by doing that, the people that really love dungeons would actually love them a little less.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I still don't understand how giving players a single player option takes away from those who like 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Like, if they want to do 5-mans, do them as 5-mans. If their friends aren't on or they don't have time to dps queue (or heck, take out the gear reward, make them a story mode or something) then do single-mode.<br />

He's saying they had debates on whether or not to put &quot;awesome content, encounters, and stories&quot; into dungeons because a lot of people, like solo players, didn't run them. He also says putting in easy/solo dungeons would piss off people who do run and enjoy dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Speculation: the 5-man groups are made up of two people who genuinely like 5-mans, and three people who tolerate them if they're the only way to see the content.

<br />
SWTOR has solo-mode flashpoints and most people still mostly do flashpoints as a group. But the solo modes are fantastic while leveling to get into the flashpoint that tells important story right now rather than sitting in a queue being unable to progress the story. This allows SWTOR to incorporate these flashpoints firmly into the story and leveling/questing process whereas in WoW the player would just abandon the dungeon quest (which you can't do and still progress in SWTOR, the FP must be done to continue).</div></div><hr />

Accessibility.<br />
<br />
I think 10 stacks of determination on Archimonde and Cata and the last 3 5 mans in Wraith and the Zul 5 mans prove that people are willing to do it and most of them are willing to learn hard content.<br />
<br />
But like many normal and heroic an dmythic raid groups Oh to many groups want people who outgear the content to padd their dmg meters. The organizers are the low geared ones. its never overgeared people looking for undergeared to carry or w/e<br />

If i could Que for Mythics thats all i would be doing since i'm already telling people how to not die horribly in heroics. The only difference is in heroics they can ignore me.</div></div><hr />

I'd guess that at that time, they didn't have the tech to scale dungeons like that, and didn't want to make 2 different versions of it - it's also a &quot;Because we didn't want to&quot; kind of thing.</div></div><hr />

Not really bothered as such, it's just the result of not raising the battle pet level cap when WoD hit, it's easier to stay in Pandaria to max out pet levels, especially pre-flight where going from one area to the other was much easier there, for levelling (Where a huge number of battles take place, just grinding those levels), avoiding Draenor outright is easily possible.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly the massive debate we're having on LFR vs normal since the beginning of WoD.<br />
<br />
Or, more lightly, the &quot;no fly&quot; vs &quot;flying&quot; debate prior to 6.2.<br />
<br />
I've never understood the &quot;giving players options makes people who like things a certain way unhappy,&quot; argument.<br />
Because the game does not recognize &quot;well&quot; the fact that you did the hard version. It's human nature: if you get the feeling that doing it easy gives you the &quot;same&quot; reward, then few people will challenge themselves purely for the challenge. And a few will and then say &quot;what was the point? Could have done it in easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's one of those &quot;can't really please everyone&quot; points.</div></div><hr />

Basically, they made a decision to not have giant lore moment in dungeons, and do them in questing instead. They want those moment to be accessible, and there are people who hate dungeons.<br />
<br />
There was an option on the table to make dungeons accessible to SOLO players, which would allow them to put those lore moments in them, but they didn't want to do that, because they figured that would be TOO accessible.<br />
<br />
Personally I was annoyed near the end of mop that I couldn't solo-queue for heroic scenarios, even not scaled-down, just to wipe the floor with them. But to each their own.</div></div><hr />

I think the real point is...at the end of the day, it's an MMO. Grouping up with people is part of the game and the dungeons would never work properly as single player content. That's what Pardo is saying, you might /think/ you'd like to do the dungeon solo, but really it was doing it with 4 other people that made it feel like you were traversing a dungeon in the first place. <br />
<br />
Personally I've never understood the people who steadfastly refuse to do /any/ group content. I mean solo content is fine, but does it not occur to them that they should perhaps adjust to the Multiplayer aspect of this MMO, rather than have content developed for people who aren't the target audience in the first place?<br />

That achievement doesn't say anything at all about pet battles and how many are doing them. It's like looking at very time consuming achievement for normal raiding(doesn't exist) and then compare it to the amount of players doing normal raiding and then claim there is no one doing normal raids - aka; it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I've spent soooo much time in pet battling, but I still have hundreds of battles left to do to get that achievement. I have 600+ unique pets at level 25 and a ton more between the levels of 11-24 - and this is not even counting all the duplicate pets I have at level 25.<br />

This.<br />
2000 pet battles is a ridicously high requirement, hence why that achievement has been unlocked by so few players. I do some pet battle casually almost everyday, and I still miss more than 1000 matches to unlock it. It's just too high, 1000 matches would have been more reasonable.<br />
The achievement unlock rate pre se says nothing about the status of pet battle.</div></div><hr />

I've done something like 950, so I'm nearly half-way there. When I was partly trying for it I was only catching rare pets, not the first ones I saw for the sake of the Royal Peachick for catching all the new Draenor pets, just to make it easier to aim towards the achievement. But I got all of them at rare after about 700 battles or so if I remember. So trying to keep battling when you've got them all and rare (besides drop pets coz that doesn't add to anything) is really mind numbing. <br />
<br />
You can do your daily menagerie quest which I have on 4 characters, so it's a max of 5 battles a day if at least one of them has Kura to fight as well. And then you can fly around (if you have flying) to raise other pets to 25 to try and attempt it just so you feel you're doing something else. But UGH that's just evil.<br />

2000 pet battles is a ridicously high requirement, hence why that achievement has been unlocked by so few players. I do some pet battle casually almost everyday, and I still miss more than 1000 matches to unlock it. It's just too high, 1000 matches would have been more reasonable.<br />
The achievement unlock rate pre se says nothing about the status of pet battle.<br />
<br />
The only pet battles that I do on Draenor are the garrison ones. But only if there's one up that's fast to do and not prone to RNG. I'm currently at roughly 1200 battles for the achievement and will just take the slow and steady route. I guess most people do it like that. Pet battles are just too sluggish to do dozens in one sitting.<br />
If doing pet battles in the wild was actually rewarding there might me some more incentive for me to do them. Right now there are only 1 or 2 wild pets left to tame (that aren't part of the taming achievement). I could try and collect the best breeds for wild pets and when they're of rare quality. But wild pets are hardly ever used and it's much easier to just spend 15 charms to upgrade a pet.</div></div><hr />

Like, if they want to do 5-mans, do them as 5-mans. If their friends aren't on or they don't have time to dps queue (or heck, take out the gear reward, make them a story mode or something) then do single-mode.<br />
<br />
I've never understood the &quot;giving players options makes people who like things a certain way unhappy,&quot; argument.<br />

You see, you get credit for the crafting achievement by right-clicking garrison mission items that create itemlvl 645 items with a cast time.<br />
<br />
The raid reward chests without a cast time (itemlvl 655+, depending on your raiding challenge level) don't count for the achievement, only the 645 ones do. Baleful items don't count either as they are blue. Unknown if they count when they're upgraded to 675. My guess is not.</div></div><hr />

This would explain that I only have 247 pet battles, although I have been doing these menagerie dailys excessively on 12 characters for several weeks, and still do whole runs with now up to 17 characters if the daily in question is fast. <br />

Stop designing content that less than 1% of the population does Blizzard<br />
<br />
The content isn't designed for the 1% - raids are designed at Heroic levels, then they tweak them up or down for mythic, normal, and LFR. If you add up all 4 levels of difficulty, I'm sure the justification for it is there. <br />
<br />
Mythic is just a harder version of heroic, it's not unique content.<br />

Probably this. I tried it, it's just not my cup of tea. Nothing against it, and I liked having certain companion pets, like my red dragon whelp I farmed for in vanilla, or my worg pup I got in UBRS in vanilla, but I didn't really go that far into it. <br />
<br />
It's on the same level as Brawler's Club and Darkmoon Faire stuff - it's there if you want to do it, but it's not required. The only difference is the garrison statue, really. <br />

Throw epic gear rewards into the pet battles, you'll see more interest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a stupid achievement. If you are a pet fanatic at all, you probably already have your pets leveled from the billions of years we had in MoP at the end of the xpac.<br />
<br />
In WoD, there were only a handful of pets to actually trap in Draenor (maybe 40 unique pets?) and even if you try to get a &quot;rare&quot; or specific power combo (P/P, H/H, etc.) you are still looking at maybe 150 pet battles to get those pets and then get them leveled. There are all kinds of +1 level stones in the game, so most of the WoD wild pets you just slammed a couple of level stones on them (or even trapped a grey and put one of your billions of make-it-rare stones from MoP on it) and were done instead of doing pet battles.<br />
<br />
The only other way (for the longest time) to do pet battles were: 1. the 6 trainers, 2. Your garrison trainer. The garrison trainer didn't count as a WoD pet battle for freaking ever, and once it did most people had stopped doing that daily anyway because they had all the pets, points, and stones they could ever need. Even if you did the 6 trainers every single day, that's 300ish days to get to 2000. Most people (without flying) didn't do them every day (I sure didn't - though I am doing them now that I have flying).<br />
<br />
There are also now the new 15 legendary pets to help, I guess?<br />
<br />
If I am at 728 unique pets, almost all to level 25, and I am nowhere near the 2000 WoD battles needed, it's unlikely that &quot;joe/joanne average&quot; is going to do it.<br />

I feel like Mythic would do much better at 15, or even 10, man-size. Let Flex (normal/heroic) be where people go for gear/alts/craving larger raids, and let Mythic be the tight-knit smaller teams. I mean the complaint is that mythic groups can't get the 20 people, right?</div></div><hr />

The choice not to make a single player version was intentional, as making it more accessible would cause players that love dungeons to love them less.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've read this through a few times now and it's extremely hard to parse. What exactly is Pardo saying?<br />
<br />
He is saying that by making multiple versions of the dungeon, single player and group, that the value of the group dungeon goes down, in terms of accomplishment etc., add your own reason, and Blizzard decided not to do this. Of course they were right in this assessment, but they completely ignored this with raids and we all see how multiple raid difficulty versions turned out.<br />
<br />
I.E. doing things in a group is perceived as more difficult, it just is by humans.<br />
<br />
Example; everyone from elementary school to high school, from college to the workplace hates group projects because they all feel that they are carrying the group. It is perceived as more difficult and people prefer to work alone and take full credit, good, bad or indifferent.<br />
<br />
If WoW made a single player dungeon or multiple difficulties the players would swarm to the one that requires the absolute least interaction with others. Proven in WoW with LFR and in every classroom where the moron that did not do anything for the group project takes credit and complains that he can't understand the charts and graphs brainy hot nerd girl made while he sat on his ass doing nothing. Brainy hot nerd girl would prefer to do it alone and get full credit for her work. So would moron dude, even though he would not be as successful.<br />

The examples you gave are all examples where people are forced to work together. That's the reason why a lot of people aren't happy with it. It's exactly the same with LFD and LFR. They force completely random people with different views, goals, opinions, experiences, etc to play together.<br />

It depends on the situation if working with a group (or a larger group) is more difficult or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If WoW made a single player dungeon or multiple difficulties the players would swarm to the one that requires the absolute least interaction with others. Proven in WoW with LFR and in every classroom where the moron that did not do anything for the group project takes credit and complains that he can't understand the charts and graphs brainy hot nerd girl made while he sat on his ass doing nothing. Brainy hot nerd girl would prefer to do it alone and get full credit for her work. So would moron dude, even though he would not be as successful.<br />
<br />
That is what he is trying to say &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
Depends on what the reward is. <br />
<br />
I think multiple difficulties work, although it is very repetitive and boring in my opinion, but multiple group sizes with the same rewards don't. Because, like you say, everyone will just choose the path of least resistance which is the smaller group size because it's simply easier. A single player version of a dungeon would only work if the rewards are much worse than the 5 man version or not even related to eachother (cosmetic rewards for example instead of gear). But it has been proven with raids that this wouldn't work well.</div></div><hr />
