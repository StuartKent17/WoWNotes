PTR 3.0.8 Notes update<br />
The official 3.0.8 PTR Patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/7536073945-ptr-patch-308-notes.html) have been updated. Some of the professions changes are very interesting (Mining now only takes one hit) and hundreds of bug fixes have been added, I guess you can stop saying that bugs aren't fixed. (Note: I'm pretty sure I mentioned some of these changes in one of the earlier update, but most of them are new)<br />

<br />
I like this change though:<br />
<br />
Mining veins and deposits no longer require multiple hits to receive all the ore. Players will receive around the same amount of ore, stone, and gems they would have received from multiple hits.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm a experienced miner. Of course I should be able to get all ores and gems of in one try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They forgot to mention the cooldown on Fan of knifes is removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing actually useful for engineers still..<br />
It's still the only profession that doesn't get any +stats unique to their profession. Most others give +32 in some way or the other.<br />
<br />
Leatherworking - The epic leg armor patches now require a Frozen Orb in addition to their other materials? Hopefully this will also apply for tailoring then.... &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Reduced the armor penalty granted by the Berserking weapon enchantment.<br />
- This was much needed. Though it's still a pure pve enchant, and any penalty at all really makes it worthless for pvp and grinding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Succulent Orca Stew - why not add this as a buyable recipe from the murlocs?<br />
<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp PvP vehicles have had their health increased. : yay for offence.<br />
Wintergrasp Tower cannons have had their health increased. : yay for defence... damnit.<br />
The Wintergrasp Fortress Exterior walls have had their health increased. : wtf , how are we ever going to get in there then?<br />
The Fortress Keep door now has had its health decreased. : o.. kay..<br />
The Orb is now instantly clickable. : eh?<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
- Hopefully they remove the &quot;daily chores&quot; from the children's week,, coz its bugged as fook probably.<br />
<br />
Mining<br />
My miner's a happy camper at this.<br />
No more retards trying to steal my vein while i'm mining or fighting a mob after 1 hit.<br />

The only thing I would like to see is 200 ilvl weapons (wands, ranged, shields, librams the lot) at the 1800-1850 mark, because it's all very well and good saying that we must all be honor capped before PvP will balance out, but not when it's impossible to even get 75% of the way there without being 2000 rating and left to use rep rewards and quest blues.. it's stupid..<br />
<br />
But I guess weapons are the new epeen atleast for casters...<br />
<br />
I mean I am only 1630 rating atm but none of the items are an upgrade for me until about 1850 which back in S4 would have been enough to net you all S4 bar shoulders and a S3 weapon and now it only nets you gloves.. and I can only see that arena has got harder interms of getting high ratings because there are alot less people playing compare to any other season in the past.. Atleast in EU Blackout..</div></div><hr />

# Dancing Rune Blade: The weapon no longer echoes the Raise Dead and Army of the Dead spells. In addition it will now more closely match the master?s damage and will cast Rune Strike when its master does.<br />

Big buff to blood. Next patch expect to see 10 million blood DK's instead of 10 million unholy. Its funny they nerfed rune strike but now blood dk's will get DOUBLE rune strikes vs you with dancing rune weapon up, considering it was nerfed from 200% to 150% damage, this buffs it up to 300% damage while dancing rune weapon is up.

Alchemy<br />
The Cooldown on Transmute: Titanium has been reduced to 1 day, and the materials required have been simplified.<br />
Reduced the cooldown on Northrend Alchemy Research from 7 days to 3 days.<br />
Added a new recipe for Ethereal Oil to grand master alchemy trainers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
Jessica Sellers, a new vendor in the Dalaran inscription shop, will sell most inscription inks for the cost of one Ink of the Sea. She also sells Snowfall Ink for multiple Inks of the Sea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
Added a new recipe to convert a frozen orb and some green quality gems into several superior quality gems.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Alchemy<br />
- If you just used a Northrend discovery before the patch, then you will still have to wait the 7 days for cooldown. If you do it after patch, you will wait 3 days for your next discovery.<br />
- The new recipe for Ethereal Oil is not on the grand master trainer in Vengeance landing or Dalaran. Maybe in future ptr build?<br />
- There is a new lesser flask: Lesser Flask of Resistance with identical description as Lesser Flask of Toughness but mats are more pricy. Toughness: 1 Goldclover, 4 Deadnettle. Resistance: 4 Fire Leaf<br />
<br />
2. Inscription.<br />
- 1 Snowfall ink costs 10 Ink of the Sea. -- Seems expensive considering we can get on average 10-20g per Ink of the Sea by inscribing popular inscriptions. I see this change raising the price of individual inscriptions, and lowering the prices for northrend cards.<br />
<br />
3. Jewelcrafting<br />
Copied my JC over twice to test out the Icy prism. First try got 1 Monarch Topaz &amp; 1 Sky Sapphire. Second try got 1 Dragon's Eye, 1 Monarch Topaz, 1 Forest Emerald, &amp; 1 Twilight Opal. I was very surprised and happy to see the Dragon's eye, which typically go for over 200g on my server.</div></div><hr />

Even worse - it's the only profession that actively encourages you to take lower stats. Really enjoying lugging around that extra belt just so I can detect clouds because the goggles are no longer best-in-slot.<br />

- 1 Snowfall ink costs 10 Ink of the Sea. -- Seems expensive considering we can get on average 10-20g per Ink of the Sea by inscribing popular inscriptions. I see this change raising the price of individual inscriptions, and lowering the prices for northrend cards.<br />
<br />
With my server's economy it's going to be a god send. It takes 40g worth of herbs to get 1 Snowfall Ink and the idea of &quot;popular inscriptions&quot; doesn't exist - the demand has tanked because everyone has the good glyphs already (and there's no incentive to buy extras) while the supply is off the scale with so many scribes desperately trying to recoup the costs of making cards now that making glyphs is so unprofitable.<br />
<br />
Glyphs are currently below cost or not selling. Vellums are still selling at cost, but the market is slowing down every week. Any northrend card that isn't a Nobles is selling 100-150g below cost.<br />
<br />
Inscription might be in even worse shape as a profession than Engineering is.</div></div><hr />

Farm some undead.<br />
It's dropped quite easily for both my chars so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even worse - it's the only profession that actively encourages you to take lower stats. Really enjoying lugging around that extra belt just so I can detect clouds because the goggles are no longer best-in-slot.<br />

The engineering enchant on the belt can be used at the same time as the extra socket a blacksmith item can give. So, no problem there. Other than that, well, engineering gives nothing. The glove enchant is poor, and the boot enchant doesn't give anything either.<br />
<br />
Inscription at least has a shoulder enchant that's better than the exalted one from sons of hodir.<br />
Engineering, has nothing.<br />
<br />
As for crafted stuff not selling. all professions suffer that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact no, Tailoring is worse. The engeneering glove improvement, at least, is slightly better (and even better after the patch) than the basic glove enchants you can put instead (though i agree the difference between the two is not worth 32 points of budget). But at least, the difference is in favor of engeneering.<br />
As for the googles, they may not be as OP as those from TBC, but they are still good, and the head is the most difficult piece of gear to replace (I still see several casters with their Malacrass's/T6 head and the rest of their gear updated to WOTLK).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, cloak embroidery is WORSE than the basic +haste enchant you can put on your cloak once you reach a certain amount of gear ..... amount which is reached with... heroic gear :p .<br />
Cheaper leg threads doesn't make a real difference (How much leg items will you own over th whole WOTLK expansion ? yep .... that's maybe a few silvers a day spared over two years). and they don't give me more DPS.<br />
The magic carpet is fun .... for a week .... an then you get a cool achievement mount, plus it doesent' give me more dps in raids either.<br />
Cooldown cloth help make a little bit of money, and easier 22 slots bags ... but thats not that much compared to what 1 or 2 hours of farming every 4 days can earn you. And guess what ... no dps stats either.<br />
Finally, there's no good piece of gear (neither BoE or BoP) to make with tailoring, except maybe ebonweave gloves if you're not hitcapped, and you can as well buy them at the AH without being a tailor.<br />
<br />
I agree that Engineering needs a little boost to be on par with, say, JC or BS, but Tailoring needs an bigger one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
^^ This guy has it right. Where are the changes to the lagged raid instances and Wintergrasp? I mean 11.5 million customers and you can't update your servers? WTF<br />
<br />
<br />
Because that doesn't require a client side change but a server side change, they have stated that they are working on this (and continued to bring up the issue). This change will come as soon as it is available and isn't really tied to any patch. Besides the news article stated that this wasn't an exhaustive list of changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tailoring has about 10 points under the available haste enchants.<br />
engineering is about 20 points worth, vs the 20-22 points worth of default enchants.<br />
So, you're right on that part.<br />
<br />
The helmet isn't hard to replace, there's plenty dropping in naxx-25. They're ugly as sin though.<br />
<br />
I use tailoring on alts, to make bags.<br />
BoP gear isn't worth it for any profession really, so the +32 stats is the only reason to keep any of them. Currently, tailoring and engineering fail in that regard, especially compared to inscription and jewelcrafting. Blizzard really needs to fix that, as it's currently simply not worth holding either profession in favour of levelling the others.<br />
<br />
Even gathering would be better.</div></div><hr />

What is preventing you from tinkering your main belt? The tinkered part doesn't affect your ability to do anything else to the belt, plus it's not like there's an enchant or anything you can add to it.</div></div><hr />
