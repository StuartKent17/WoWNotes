<br />
Welcome to the answers thread for our World of Warcraft &quot;Ask the Devs&quot; global Q&amp;A. These answers are in response to the round #7 questions, which can be seen here: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2037905341<br />
<br />
If you have to ask a question on the Firelands you'd like answered please visit the Ask the Devs #8 Questions thread here: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2098312571<br />
<br />
Will you add more non-combat, or purely artistic, or stat-free, or random effect toy / fun / flavor items to the profession of my choice? – A multitude of players from all regions<br />
<br />
Yes, especially considering they are some of our favorite things to add to the game. We can't promise that every profession is going to get equal amounts, but we definitely intend to spread them out more evenly, except for engineering. Engineers will always get more toys. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Archaeology is supposed to be about discovering, preserving, and honoring cultural items found, in order to learn from the past. Currently we don't do that. Instead we are forced to coldly vendor what we don't want. No donation to a museum, no return to the races of origin. Couldn’t we do something more important with these items? Can we expect more interesting stories with artifacts? Will you do something about this to make it feel like the player is getting something useful back, and perhaps remove a little bit of the random part of it so that it's more fun and focused? - Whitewnd (KR), Pusen (EU-EN), Unjoiner (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
Originally, we didn't intend to create items at all when you completed a normal archaeology find, but that didn't feel right. So now we have these items that still don't feel right because you can't do anything fun with them. We are working on a more thematic and interesting way to consume the artifacts you dig up. These include returning them to the museums (for the devoted archaeologist) and the option to continue vendoring them (if you wish to continue your career as a cold-blooded treasure hunter.)<br />
<br />
Additionally, we plan to add daily quests, a deeper story, additional skill gains, and the flexibility to focus on a specific race.<br />
<br />
Some players may not have noticed that all artifacts have lore associated with them in the journal, even the grey ones. Every bit of it is Genuine Lore, and verified by our lore masters. So were the Dalaran Coins, of course, but not those silly Romance Novels. <br />
<br />
<br />
Will professions at some point regain the ability to make upgradable items, such as the Weaponsmiths had in the Burning Crusade? It was quite a cool concept, and wouldn't be unfair if all crafting professions would gain at least 1 of those items. - Hydramith (EU-EN), Auryon (EU-DE)<br />
<br />
The concept of upgrading a piece of equipment is a very cool idea that we'd love to revisit, but not as a best in slot item. A crafted BIS item removes that entire slot as an interesting drop choice, and it strongly forces players into specific professions. For example, if there is a crafted best in slot weapon, you can bet a vast majority of players will feel obligated to take up blacksmithing, as was the case in the Burning Crusade. The profession perks, which are reasonably balanced, already add an incentive to take professions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Have you ever considered creating daily quests for professions other than jewelcrafting? - Superpotion (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
We've mostly considered it for the secondary professions, since they are the most accessible professions to the most players. When we add another large chunk of recipes again, we'll evaluate each profession to see if dailies are a good fit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Will enchanters ever get the option to create wands again (maybe other caster items as well using a blank template weapon that could be made by blacksmiths), as they tend to be extremely rare outside of the a couple locations and the new ZA/ZG loot tables? - Flayre (NA/ANZ) [/i]<br />
<br />
In general, we want to add more fun themed recipes to enchanting like the magic lanterns. Concerning wands, we've been discussing several options, and most everything we could do with them is still on the table. <br />
<br />
<br />
Will there be a way to distinguish profession nodes on the minimap for those that have two gathering professions? - Discordia (LA)<br />
<br />
That’s a good suggestion. We recently added the ability to see your target and focus target on the minimap, but the feedback we’ve received from players is that they clutter up the map too much. Coming up with unique icons that work with only a few pixels might be challenging. We’ll give it a shot though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Will you provide a way to speed up the acquiring of glyphs usually acquired through research and glyph books? Glyph books (Book of Glyph Mastery) are hard to come by now that people spend so little time in WotLK content. - Furlqt (NA/ANZ), 에르네**린덴만 (KR), Kånê (EU-ES)<br />
<br />
Yes. We will be changing the discovery spells so they can teach all possible glyphs, and the books will simply provide a no-cooldown method to do the same thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to make Archaeology more closely connected with other professions? Like make inscriptors able to create scripts of the night elves that would help with the fragments or something like that? - Алонжи (EU-RU)<br />
<br />
We feel like we can better tune and balance the archaeology experience if we keep it mostly self-contained. However, we've discussed additional methods for gaining fragments through dailies and potentially as rewards for turning artifacts. Nonetheless, it's quite unlikely that another profession will ever craft keystones or fragments. <br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to make Chaos Orbs BoA or even BoE? - Mommycow (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
Yes! They will be unbound in a future patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have plans to make gathering professions more attractive instead of making them skills that you would be inclined to take up on one of your alts? - Nanahuatzin (LA)<br />
<br />
Yes, this is an ongoing goal. Specialized nodes and raid/dungeon drops for gatherers are a good start. Because gathering professions essentially pull currencies from the ground, we feel they are a valid choice for many players, especially those who want to be self-sufficient. <br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to change Original and Burning Crusade profession skills so that new players can skill up their profession skills more similar pace with leveling? Low level trade skill materials on Auction House are generally expensive for new players, and new players must feel they are stuck if they should left low level zones just for profession skill up, while they want to increase both of them at same pace. - Whitewnd (KR), Гаркара (EU-RU)<br />
<br />
Yes. Definitely. As we move forward, making sure older content has a smooth flow is a top priority. In fact, we have Top Men working on it. Top. Men. <br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to somehow change Archeology and Fishing, which have become notoriously tedious? Do you have plans to make archaeology more appealing, maybe with puzzles or something else? - Boîndal (EU-DE), Kalani (NA/ANZ), Käworu (LA)<br />
<br />
Yes. The dailies help with fishing skill gain, and we plan to add archaeology dailies as well. We've also discussed further incentivizing fishing in pools with faster skill gain.<br />
<br />
We would love to add a puzzle mini-game to archaeology, and may do that one day, but we can’t make any guarantees. There are some other ideas floating around for moving between archaeology sites more quickly, and we've been brainstorming for rare random events when you are digging or fishing.<br />
<br />
Our overall goal for these professions is that it shouldn't be too difficult to max out your skill, but catching every fish and finding every artifact should be a long journey.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2011-05-16, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why, after the first 6, I still read these and expect any of the questions to be interesting (the mark of a fool is returning to the same thing several times, expecting different results). Unique node icons for gathering? Use Gatherer. Really. It's nice to have some sort of dialogue with the devs, but I'd really prefer quality responses. If the answer is &quot;we're thinking about it, but we don't know yet,&quot; that should just be assumed. They've screamed until their text went blue (lol, see what I did there) that they read player feedback, but apparently enough people still think that &quot;Blizzard doesn't care,&quot; that they have to waste their time responding to things like that.<br />
<br />
By the same token, it appears that the devs just choose questions they can either answer vaguely/uselessly (example--the wands question. What kind of answer is that, other than completely evasive? WELL WE COULD DO ANYTHING AT THIS POINT, GUYS) or questions that aren't relevant or are easy to answer. The problem with yes/no style questions (like the crafting keystones one) is that it opens the opportunity for a simple no answer. That doesn't tell us what they *are* working on, only one of the many things they are *not*.<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed in the decision to go away from upgrade-weapons/armor lines. They wouldn't have to be bis (and wouldn't be, compared to heroic mode loots, anyway) but they added a way for professions to feel more significant rather than just a way to add extra sockets or use stronger gems.<br />
<br />
I can understand where some people would be excited about the chaos orb change (for crafting on their alts) but in my experience I really haven't had problems obtaining them. My main is sitting on 20 right now, actually. And, when that change goes live, that will pretty much crash the market for crafted items. Hooray.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'll all be unbound. It's what happened with Nethers in TBC.<br />
<br />
Also: WOOOOO on the Inscription change. That needs to happen right _now_ though. Some glyphs are selling for 500g each for skills that are learnable at level 25. Makes it a nightmare for newer players who have no gold.</div></div><hr />

They could have just answered all the Archaeology questions in one go. and picked a few different questions to answer. I would have loved to see some of the compensation for enchanters de'ing in groups answers since they are thinking about adding drops for gathering professions. (every one should get to roll like they do on &quot;enchanters&quot; drops). Or some talk about making old recipies available through some other means.<br />
<br />
Or hell even talk about plans for a fishing over haul. One of the things I was looking forward to the most was the talk of the fishing overhaul from blizzcon. Oh well animal crossing is pretty cheap for the wii now so I could get a fix that way.</div></div><hr />

They may be considered useless now, but thats your own fault for rolling on something you know you are not going to use.<br />
When everyone can get them without running any dungeons they will become even less valuable and with it being likely in a later tier they will be less desirable as far as the crafted results go and therefore more useless than they are now.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the answers thread for our World of Warcraft and a Full Curse Client of Add-Ons &quot;Ask the Devs&quot; global Q&amp;A.<br />
<br />
This may shock you, but not everybody uses add-ons. The fact that your &quot;solution&quot; is for someone to find a way to edit the game to make it work means that there is an issue. Blizzard just wants to do it officially rather than suggesting third-party sources. I'm sure your answer a year ago was &quot;Can't find where these mobs spawn? Use Quest Helper. Really.&quot;</div></div><hr />

the problem with archeology is this: Archaeology is endless grind and 99% of the rewards are craptastic and completely useless. That's why it isn't fun. In case you want to improve this profession, you have to realize the fact that <br />
- story as reward doesn't work and<br />
- cosmetical or fun items as reward don't work either</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2011-05-16, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This may shock you, but not everybody uses add-ons.

<br />
It doesn't shock me, at all. And the improved quest UI was actually an instance of Blizzard making the UI better than an addon, and require less resources (Quest Helper has always been notorious for 1) being broken after every hotfix/patch and 2) being a resource hog). Incidentally, my answer a year ago was, &quot;Then read the quest text, you dolt,&quot; or, on the occasion where the quest text wasn't helpful, &quot;Yeah, that one is confusing. Here's where that mob is.&quot; If they can actually make the default UI better, by all means, they should do it! But let's look at the totem changes and then the TotemTimers addon. The totem ui changes were long overdue and kinda nice, but Totemtimers still makes everything far more customizable and tracks helpful addons. I don't know many warlocks that go without NeedtoKnow or Quartz or some addon to help them track buffs/debuffs, after a buff/debuff UI &quot;overhaul&quot; by Blizzard. OmniCC greatly improves players' timing in terms of cooldowns/etc. I could go on and on. That's not even considering how long it takes Blizzard to implement these UI changes. Addons are out for months (in some cases, years) before Blizz UI &quot;catches up&quot; to them.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, and I may sound elitist for saying this: Players who are concerned with their performance, and want to have things be as customized and convenient (for them) as possible, will always use addons, regardless of what UI updates Blizzard makes. Players who don't typically have no idea what they're missing or some sort of stubborn attitude issue. There's really no reason not to use addons (unless your computer is absolutely ancient--but mine is a 6 year old laptop and runs with 20+ addons just fine, thanks). The power of addons is their customizability--the weakness of Blizzard UI is how limited customization is (for the sake of new players and making it relatively &quot;idiot-proof&quot;). Players can sit around for Blizzard to maybe eventually change the UI (&quot;soon&quot; tm) or they can be more proactive, go out into the Addon community (which is honestly one of the better communities associated with WoW) and get the features and customizability that players have wanted all along.<br />
<br />
My complaint was more that they chose to answer a question that relates to a very well known and very popular addon already in the game, rather than talking about new, unique features they might be developing. But thanks for taking me out of context and giving me a chance to elaborate! Totally tangental.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then what's the point of these Q&amp;A's? They might as well just post, &quot;Yes, we hear your complaints/suggestions, and yes, we're thinking about doing something, at some point in time, about them.&quot; <br />

Sorry; I'll admit it was a knee-jerk reaction by me, but I'm frustrated by the mentality that the game doesn't need to be changed as long as there's an add-on out there that does it for you.<br />
<br />
I do agree with you that it's frustrating to get back these vague answers. I think Blizzard (perhaps rightly) assumes that everything they do say in these Q&amp;As will be held against them as evidence if they decide to change plans or scrap features, but that says more about a cowardice on their part to commit and a fear that their player-base will somehow &quot;revolt&quot; if demands aren't met.

I'd tend to agree. I think the problem here is that they talk a lot about what they're thinking about doing, not what they're actually working on. It's all fine and great to have a bunch of guys sit around a table and write down ideas on a whiteboard, but I think in the long run players want to know what's being done and what they will see soon as opposed to 5 months from now. 5 months from now, everything could change. But something that is slated to be released in a month or two probably won't.<br />

Pretty much this, re the whole Q&amp;A. They make no money while leveling (in terms of crafting. Gathering is always profitable, even if it's just a small amount), the gear crafted is now pretty dated/useless compared to the updated (relevant) quest rewards (at least until you reach Outlands/Northrend where the stats are laughable thanks to stat/gear overhauls), and the items crafted are great, but if they require raid materials then you're likely to get a replacement slot item while raiding for them. Making Chaos Orbs BoE will essentially crush any market that's still going on crafted epics (and further trivialize them) given the ease of obtaining said orbs.</div></div><hr />

Yes. We will be changing the discovery spells so they can teach all possible glyphs, and the books will simply provide a no-cooldown method to do the same thing. THIS made me so happy. About time, too; I was kind of left in the dust, making my scribe after Cata.<br />

Are there any plans to somehow change Archeology and Fishing, which have become notoriously tedious? Do you have plans to make archaeology more appealing, maybe with puzzles or something else? - Boîndal (EU-DE), Kalani (NA/ANZ), Käworu (LA)<br />
<br />
Yes. The dailies help with fishing skill gain, and we plan to add archaeology dailies as well. We've also discussed further incentivizing fishing in pools with faster skill gain.<br />
<br />
We would love to add a puzzle mini-game to archaeology, and may do that one day, but we can’t make any guarantees. There are some other ideas floating around for moving between archaeology sites more quickly, and we've been brainstorming for rare random events when you are digging or fishing.<br />
<br />
Our overall goal for these professions is that it shouldn't be too difficult to max out your skill, but catching every fish and finding every artifact should be a long journey. *point!* Look, me! rofl<br />
<br />
I dunno, I'm a little disappointed by this answer, personally. Why does catching fish have to feel like a long journey? I don't get it.</div></div><hr />

As someone in the thread said earlier, &quot;this all seems like common sense.&quot; But then, it is a rare currency these days.<br />
<br />
Sad fact, common sense is relative. It's affected by education, experience, social interaction, research, luck, learning from mistakes of other's etc etc. What is common sense to one person will not be common sense to another.<br />
<br />
For example, if I wrote &quot;I learnt something today&quot;, some misguided American may correct me by saying &quot;It's learned, not learnt, learn to spell&quot;. He would be wrong because it's cultural. He has never come across an Englishman before and therefore would not know. It's common sense to me, it's common sense to anyone that has ever spoken to a limey before, but it's not common sense to him, and to humiliate him because of a lack of experience is actually unjust, no matter how funny it is to watch him squirm out of their mistake.<br />
<br />
In regards to this, players have short memory spans (people saying that Cata's raiding is the easiest raid content to date, for example) and just don't remember what happened and when or why with previous expansions. There are also players that just don't follow game development as closely as others, as identified by people asking why there is a static logon screen for the PTR or why the Dungeon Journel uses Grim Batol as a background image (they don't automatically think &quot;placeholder&quot;).<br />
<br />
Examples of lack of common sense regarding development techniques are to be found all over the place. This websites community is no less lacking in that department as that of the official forums, or any other fanbase community. The many will bring down the perceived knowledge of the few, and no matter what those few do, some people just will not learn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabaka</div><div class="date">2011-05-16, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what my take on all the answers was:<br />
<br />
&quot;Will professions at some point regain the ability to make upgradable items, such as the Weaponsmiths had in the Burning Crusade? It was quite a cool concept, and wouldn't be unfair if all crafting professions would gain at least 1 of those items. - Hydramith (EU-EN), Auryon (EU-DE)<br />
<br />
The concept of upgrading a piece of equipment is a very cool idea that we'd love to revisit, but not as a best in slot item. A crafted BIS item removes that entire slot as an interesting drop choice, and it strongly forces players into specific professions. For example, if there is a crafted best in slot weapon, you can bet a vast majority of players will feel obligated to take up blacksmithing, as was the case in the Burning Crusade. The profession perks, which are reasonably balanced, already add an incentive to take professions.&quot;<br />
<br />
we had much success with profs in BC because it made them unique bc of the bop item crafting... ppl liked it too much so we're not putting it back (and we want to lose more subs!)<br />
<br />
&quot;Will enchanters ever get the option to create wands again (maybe other caster items as well using a blank template weapon that could be made by blacksmiths), as they tend to be extremely rare outside of the a couple locations and the new ZA/ZG loot tables? - Flayre (NA/ANZ) [/i]<br />
<br />
In general, we want to add more fun themed recipes to enchanting like the magic lanterns. Concerning wands, we've been discussing several options, and most everything we could do with them is still on the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
crafting wands which are good is too smart! we at blizzard like to make the bis item drop from trash (lol @ some casters in paragon and other progressed/active guilds using a blue wand after 2months of raiding 5nights a week-- thats balanced?) <br />
<br />
^seriously why even have professions anymore at all? u should just have everyone pick a bonus racial when they make their toon and be done with it.. uve taken away all that is unique and awesome about every profession, good job<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there any plans to make Archaeology more closely connected with other professions? Like make inscriptors able to create scripts of the night elves that would help with the fragments or something like that? - Алонжи (EU-RU)<br />
<br />
We feel like we can better tune and balance the archaeology experience if we keep it mostly self-contained. However, we've discussed additional methods for gaining fragments through dailies and potentially as rewards for turning artifacts. Nonetheless, it's quite unlikely that another profession will ever craft keystones or fragments.&quot;<br />
<br />
no, do not confuse archeology with other professions! archeology is like fishing, it is a useless time waster that we put in the game to try to get more playtime from ppl who are bored bc this content is terrible<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there any plans to make Chaos Orbs BoA or even BoE? - Mommycow (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
Yes! They will be unbound in a future patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes! They will be unbound when they are useless in a tier or two, so you can gear up your alts faster! this is world of alt craft!<br />

This means that if, for example, blacksmithing made a BoP BiS tank shield, then all people of the class(es) for which it is BiS have to take that profession for the BiS item and then don't give a shit about any tank shield that drops. This then makes Blizz say &quot;well, why bother making any boss drop tank shields since all tanks will be blacksmiths for that shield anyways.&quot; Assuming that all tradeskills make nothing but BoE items, well that means that the BiS tank shield makes Blizz even less interested in making drops that look interesting since everyone knows a blacksmith or can just buy one off the AH.</div></div><hr />

They want us playing, grinding raids and dungeons to get BiS epics. The more epics you buy or make, the faster you get gear, the faster people get bored and cancel till the next content update. <br />
<br />
Obviously the idea is to keep playing for the longest time possible, BiS epcis with low drop rates from hard bosses keeps people playing longer.</div></div><hr />

The itemization for the current tier was just awful. On top of reputation items, you had crafted items for the same slots (plate dps belts, in particular) and then several bosses dropping them as well. I can't tell you how often something would drop during our early farming and we'd say, &quot;Nope, already got something better/good enough from crafting/rep,&quot; meanwhile it took an eternity for the stupid tank trinket to drop off Magmaw. This tier has been frustrating, and not for good reasons (such as encounter challenge, fun, etc).</div></div><hr />

Making Chaos Orbs BoE will essentially crush any market that's still going on crafted epics (and further trivialize them) given the ease of obtaining said orbs.<br />
<br />
Most professions are useful &quot;past the self bonus&quot; in fact if you are least bit creative you could make some nice gold out there. The only profession that is literally completely useless past self buff would be ENG<br />
<br />
Lets compare some profession &quot;re-sale items&quot; shall we (items, services created by professions that can be sold for profit)<br />
<br />
Chanting - DE, Enchanting items or vellums, selling raw mats<br />
JC - Prospecting for others, Gem Cutting, Selling raw gems<br />
Inscription - Glyphs, DM Fair Decks<br />
Alchemy - Flasks, Pots, X-mutes<br />
Tailoring - BoEs, Bag upgrades, Spell Thread (not to mention the extremely OP Self Bonus it provides for casters)<br />
BS, LW - Leg Armor, BoEs, Belt Buckle<br />
<br />
Eng gets NOTHING... o sorry forgot the gun scope which is currently cheaper to buy in ah then cost of mats. The glove tinker is ok but its exactly on par with every major (non-gathering) profession and is a self buff. The helm is a good starter but pretty useless once you can get some real epics. The parachute cloak is fun i guess... but very situational and has become an instrument for idiots to pull neff with. The boots are not usable in BG and completely unreliable = useless in any real situation. Thats pretty much it. We can only craft 1 lousy bop epic and get reduced fall speed on 2 min CD. Doesnt seem fair at all. I guess i can somewhat understand the BG boots nerf, although its nothing compared to druids... kitty dash with flag pop into travel form = is OP as hell and that is perfectly allowable in BGs. Repair Bots - kind of useful but not crucial, most raids have at least one person with repair mount which can be popped outside after a wipe or a repair vendor located few min away. Bottom line is blizz pretty much flipped Eng &quot;the bird&quot; I really wish i didnt dump so much gold on leveling ENG</div></div><hr />

What the heck is this supposed to actually mean? What is the definition of an 'interesting drop choice'?<br />
<br />
An interesting slot choice is.. you know, when you constantly have a tank drop after the first boss of a heroic because that is the boss that drops the slot item he needs. I can´t tell you how many times I thought about dropping groups after the first boss of LCT because he had my bears weapon. And earlier than that, I remember the first boss of HOO dropped a particular item for my moonkin spec... of course it also dropped from the 2nd boss of ToT that everyone skips. I wish the devs would revisit that whole system... but yeah, what he is basically saying is that if you can craft it, it will be a wasted item slot they can´t use for boss drops.</div></div><hr />

Currently because of the annoying gem demands certain uncommon gems sell for more then rare gems. Also the dailies massively limit the repertoire for a single jewelcrafter. If a jewelcrafter is expected to have a variety of cuts they have to grind for several months, This is not true for other professions, at least not to the timely degree JCs have. <br />
<br />
Plus all of a jewelcrafters grinding for recipes will go to waste when Blizzard stops arbitrarily holding back epic gems.</div></div><hr />

You r absolutely right.<br />
Love ENG and want to keep it this way BUT!<br />
There is nothing for us in Cata. Helm, few pets, gloves... Not even talking 'bout making some gold here. <br />
Blizz made cogwheel - and we can use it only for 1 item?? Whats the point?<br />

umm how is chanting and jc value gonna drop? with new gear to be gemmed, chanted and DEd chanting will go up. So will JC. We already saw this happen even when 4.1 hit. When Epic Gems are introduced JC will skyrocket to the top again. Yes you are correct the 357 craftable BOEs will drop in price a lot, but so will the mats for them. and there will still be demand for them. players with alts will want to gear them out asap and get them firelands-able asap so they will be buying the 357 boes instead of trying to grind old raids hoping to get the drops they need. So even if the Boe drop to 500-700g a pop they will still be bringing in few hundred gold here and there. If they were to give ENG goggles a 4.2 upgrade it still wouldnt do jack because it would require ENG to use just like 95% of what we can make. Scription will take a bigger hit just because the DMF Cards are not gonna surpass 4.2 trinkets although they will still be viable choices for alt gearing etc. <br />
<br />
your entire argument made no sense. especially the part i made bold. umm yes perks are self buffs... the issue is that eng provides nothing of value to others that can be sold. Obviously craft profs are not gonna bring as much gold in as gathering profs would, but most crafting profs still provide a decent way of making some extra gold. When cata dropped i made over 100k with JC/Chanting. It was simple: i would buy ore prospect it, all the rare gems i would cut into most expensive cuts and put on AH. Regular gems i would use to make rings, necklaces, and fist weapons then DE them for chanting mats and sell the mats. i can still effectively do this today with a smaller profit margin.</div></div><hr />

They want us playing, grinding raids and dungeons to get BiS epics. The more epics you buy or make, the faster you get gear, the faster people get bored and cancel till the next content update. <br />
<br />
Obviously the idea is to keep playing for the longest time possible, BiS epcis with low drop rates from hard bosses keeps people playing longer.<br />
<br />
It seems like this design philosophy is a penny wise and a pound foolish, since often when people realize the futility of this endless carrot and stick process you see them permanently quitting. Basing part of your game design on 'interesting drop choices' seems to be taking the lazy road, as opposed to figuring out how to continue being innovative and engaging in your content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not going to say much about the cowardice that these answers reek of (as others have already beaten me to the punch), what with their &quot;we might...&quot; and &quot;we're thinking of...&quot; answers, but come on! I'm sorry, but Blizzard needs to learn how to own up to their decisions! Say, &quot;oh hey, that was a great question; here's what we're working on right now,&quot; (or even just flat-out admit that there's nothing on the table for the foreseeable future) and if it changes during production and people grill them about it after it's released, tell them they need to understand what an iterative design process is -- &quot;yes, that's the concept we originally started with, and we ended up changing it because of X, Y, and Q factors; now stfu and drink some more haterade... you're slippin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
And about the upgrade-able crafted gear, why do they automatically try to swing the pendulum from none all the way back to BiS gear, as if there's nothing possible in between? Smells like a cop-out response to me...<br />
&quot;Well, if we do upgrade-able crafted gear again, we have to make it BiS or no one's going to use it.&quot; No, you nimrod... you make it an upgrade over the preceding tier and give it an equal ilvl to that of the current raiding tier, but just don't make it BiS. Since all the classes and their gearing desires have been homogenized - almost to death - that's not hard to do at all. And allow it to be upgraded via the same system used during BC; using vortexes/motes/orbs/gummi bears/whatever that will only drop in the current tier of raiding. <br />
<br />
As an example, say you craft a 359 2h Sword of Awesome. Now, it's certainly better than a 346 2h weapon, but it has haste on it... ick (or maybe it just has a slightly lower dps, or maybe it's only a 353 item, whatever, there are many design paths to take here). So if the new Ashkandi drops off Nefarian, wow, that's not a huge upgrade, but it's still better than what you've got. Now later on in the next tier, you grab one of the new orbs that drops off every boss and use that to upgrade your old sword to the Sword of More Awesome, ilvl 372 (or 366 -- again, many paths), and the cycle starts over again. <br />
It's certainly not the best item for you, but, at the very least, you'd have a means of personal progression available that isn't completely reliant on a slot machine (nor overpowered, to compensate for that fact). And I'm sure that, for some, that's a hell of a lot better than nothing at all...<br />

Agreed. I could tell you that I'm thinking of pink and purple dragons in a cherry red sky, but that doesn't mean I'm ever going to implement it. I don't particularly care what's being thought about in the long run. I want to know what is going to happen soon, because I'm not going to continue playing a game on a &quot;maybe, someday, well we don't know,&quot; sort of mentality.<br />

<br />
That's more eloquently-put than my post was. I really don't understand why we can't keep crafting relevant to the current tier but underneath heroic mode loot. I also don't understand why we couldn't have some slots filled completely by crafteds (say, bracers--something that is hidden under most armor, so you don't get everybody looking the same--oh wait, they already do) so that we could shrink boss loot tables and increase chances of useful things dropping, AND ensure that the armor/weapon crafting professions remain at least somewhat profitable (take it back from a materials market, which in turn would hurt gold-farmers/sellers).</div></div><hr />

1. why weren't chaos orbs BoE all the time? it was a pain to not have a profession that can use it, so I had to ask for the goodwill of guildies or friends to have an item made. (I had the leather belt made for my rogue, and could not provide the orbs needed. Why?)<br />
2. Why does JC not have any epic things like necklace or rings. (that are useful)<br />
3. Why isn't there a jewelbag of 32 or 36 slots? (tailoring?)<br />
4. Why did they remove the 'alchemy only' from the sandstone drake?<br />
5. why does truegold and volatile transmutes share a cooldown, while the gem transmutes don't?<br />
<br />
for the more tedious professions fishing and archeology:<br />
<br />
Fishing wishlist :<br />
<br />
- sagefish in pools maybe?<br />
- chance to fish up more than one fish at a time?<br />
- Use of a net instead of a fishing pole?<br />
- chance to fish up nice things, instead of only grey crap<br />
- Cut the fish you don't need open and it give you a chance on something nice.<br />
- Use the tackle box for something useful, like for catching fish, instead of just being a bag.<br />
<br />
<br />
archeology wishlist:<br />
<br />
- Maybe use the stuff we get to raise reputations (with for example steamwheedle cartel factions, or the according race factions)<br />
- Please add some more digsites per continent. The 4 we have now is just too little.<br />
- Survey shows the closest by of all fragments spot, instead of just one at a time. It annoys me to survey at border A of a site, having to go to the opposite border to get your first set of fragments, and then just have to return to place A for the second number of fragments.<br />
- More fragments or surveys per digsite. Or add ‘rich’ sites, that give you extra fragments.<br />
- Chance to dig up a treasure map you can use to make an item of your choice. Let’s say 1% of the digsites give you such a map. It would be less tedious hunting for the pet, mount or other artefact you want.</div></div><hr />

Are there any plans to somehow change Archeology and Fishing, which have become notoriously tedious? Do you have plans to make archaeology more appealing, maybe with puzzles or something else? - Boîndal (EU-DE), Kalani (NA/ANZ), Käworu (LA)<br />
<br />
Yes. The dailies help with fishing skill gain, and we plan to add archaeology dailies as well. We've also discussed further incentivizing fishing in pools with faster skill gain.<br />
<br />
We would love to add a puzzle mini-game to archaeology, and may do that one day, but we can’t make any guarantees. There are some other ideas floating around for moving between archaeology sites more quickly, and we've been brainstorming for rare random events when you are digging or fishing.<br />
<br />
Our overall goal for these professions is that it shouldn't be too difficult to max out your skill, but catching every fish and finding every artifact should be a long journey. <br />
<br />
While I don't have an issue with them making it so skilling up these profs is easier, when are they going to add some kind of incentive for maxed fishing?<br />
<br />
Can you change the +1/+2 skill reward to some kind of token when at max skill, redeemable for cool fishing gear/lures/etc.? I mean, really. What they have now is nice, but it means @#$%-all once you're capped out.</div></div><hr />

Are there any plans to make Chaos Orbs BoA or even BoE? - Mommycow (NA/ANZ)<br />
<br />
Yes! They will be unbound in a future patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, you will see them unbound but not in the 4.2 release. I am betting they leave those things bound until they release the gear reset patch.<br />
<br />
Primal Nethers and Vortexes didn't go unbound until Patch 2.4, when Sunwell was released.<br />
Frozen Orbs we unbound from Day 1.<br />
<br />
Between the two, Wrath's idea sucked the most.<br />
<br />
By incorporating them into current content, they guarantee the need to run heroics and to help the masses out there that enjoy playing with complete strangers. If you unbind them they immediately drop in price so there's no real incentive to even run Heroics except to cap out VPs during new content, which will ultimately lead to extended queue times for most everyone as people stop needing VPs. They would be very smart to leave them bound and incorporate them into everything until they get close to Deathwing as this is an excellent way to insure that most all profession proficient players are able to assist the characters that need to run them the most.<br />
<br />
And if you have several stacks of them in your bags, go use them and make the items they were meant to make.</div></div><hr />

Have your considered the idea of people able to control WHERE your cast is going... it is a sad sad joke that at 525 fishing skill it still takes sometimes 10 casts just to hit a pool... this is not even remotely realistic and honestly it is just a pain in the rear. How about giving us the ability to place the cast like you do with aoe etc? That would be a wonderful idea!</div></div><hr />
