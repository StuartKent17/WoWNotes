Q: Is it a possibility that the premade group requirement will be dropped from Rated Battlegrounds, allowing players to queue for a Random Rated Battleground? I'm sure many people would be ok with the inherent risk and disadvantage of grouping with random players for rated content if it meant they could at least make use of the rating system. – Gëtmastiffd (North America/ANZ), Kaymac (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: If you take away the group requirements for Rated Battlegrounds, then you don’t have Rated Battlegrounds – you just have the same old Battlegrounds we’ve always had expect they now reward the best loot in the game. We understand there are heavy logistical requirements to organizing teams – that is in part why the rewards are so good. We believe that if we just opened the doors to random queuing that the system would be less about organized teams competing against organized teams and more about the luck of whether you got a good team or not. You are much more optimistic than we are about how forgiving players would be when Blizzard ignorantly / cruelly stuck them in a team with one Prot paladin and six rogues with no resilience. ? Teams on the other hand have all the responsibility themselves. If they feel comfortable bringing an experienced player with sub-optimal gear, they can make that call. If they think a certain number of healers or particular comp is required, they can try to locate them. Most importantly, there is a leader with some level of power. If you ignore the leader and just do your own thing, the leader can choose to replace you.<br />
<br />
This is our first stab at offering very powerful gear through Battlegrounds and it is going to take some tweaking to get right. We understand that some more casual players may have given up on the system and we want a chance to fix that. It’s possible we could require fewer players to form a team, such as merging two groups of 5 together – at least we’d know for sure that you had 2 healers and had put some thought into your comp. We could also put in some kind of browsing system to make it easier to find people looking for Rated Battle Grounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why can't we have a pure, straight up, unadulterated Death Match style Battleground? - ???? ???? (Taiwan), Gulantor (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: We think Battlegrounds work better when there is a goal that the team can work towards. Huge melees with lots of players tend to be chaotic by nature so there is less room for skill to influence the outcome. It feels more random, and the more random the system is, the more arbitrary the rewards will feel. It might be something we try someday.<br />
<br />
For example, emergency buttons are balanced around the assumption that only a few players are ganged up against you. Even in the 5v5 Arena bracket, it’s very difficult to survive being focused by so many players at once, so you feel like you don’t have many options. There is a reason that most of our Arena attention is on 3v3 – it just feels the best. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Arena Skirmishes: What happened to them? They were a useful tool in trying new compositions, testing out a new teammate, or just having some fun during downtime. Wargames are nice, but did skirmishes have to go in order for them to be implemented? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ), Nølfen (Europe [French]), Jinusek (Europe [English]), Whoohoo (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: We didn’t cut Skirmishes because they were flawed. We just thought we’d get more bang for the buck out of Wargames. While some players enjoyed Skirmishes, we can tell you that overall they were used very rarely. We would have kept them if it had been relatively easy to do so, and we may add them back someday, but it’s just not a huge priority based on their previous popularity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: In Cataclysm, PvP fights were supposed to be slow and everyone should spend longer in a wounded state. But from what I’m seeing, healers are still able to bring someone up from 1% to 100% in 2 or 3 global CDs. So it comes down back to the WOTLK style, either you burst someone in a CD and damage spike, or you need a setup with tons of CC. There simply is not a state where someone is at 50% health and you can keep him around that way with your damage. He will be at 100% in the next 2 global CDs. Any plans to address this? – Noidealol (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: We just don’t think that is the case in Cataclysm relative to Lich King. Players have roughly 100,000 health, and even the big heals, which are very hard to use in PvP, only heal by 30,000 or so. Most healers do have some kind of emergency button (say Nature’s Swiftness plus Healing Touch) and that may be what you’re seeing, or else hots are ticking away for a longer period of time (longer than 2-3 GCDs for sure). We have had some burst issues rise up from time to time (say Aimed Shot, or more recently warriors), but we take pains to stomp them out when they happen. Overall we’re seeing a wide variety of classes and specs participating in Arenas, which argues that there are several strategies that work, not just the focus on one dude and blow him up strategy that prevailed in the previous expansion.<br />
<br />
All that said, we are looking closely at healing in PvP right now. It can be really hard to kill say a flag carrier being assisted by multiple healers (especially once there is less burst damage from Balance druids and warriors).<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will guilds focused on PvP be able to progress and have rewards just like guilds focused on PvE?/ Will it be possible in the future to advance guild reputation through PvP? – Smrt (Europe [German]), Ypsen (Europe [French])<br />
<br />
A: We did try and emphasize Rated Battlegrounds as a way that guilds could progress. We thought it made more sense to have guilds focused on BGs than on Arenas, since the latter just don’t require the large infrastructure of a guild for support. It was a purposefully limited approach as the Guild Advancement system was new and rather complex, but now that we've had time to watch and see how it's being used we're a bit more comfortable opening it up where it makes sense. So in 4.1 we are actually making it so you can earn guild XP and reputation from Battlegrounds, Arenas, or just Honorable Kills. Details aren't totally nailed down yet so we'll let you know the specifics in upcoming PTR patch note updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: With the proliferation of spell interrupts and other control mechanisms, and the ever-increasing value of mobility, how do the developers plan to successfully move casters away from instant casts and make hard casting in PvP more viable? – Maldramere (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: It will require several changes. We feel these changes will ultimately make the game better, but they are big, scary changes, so they aren’t the kind of thing we can just make in patch 4.1. For starters, we need to make instant spells less powerful. The fact that they are instant should be the big thing those spells have going for them, because immunity from interruption and the ability to shoot and scoot are gigantic advantages. Those spells don’t need anything else to be attractive. Secondly, we need to tone down the role of interrupts and silences so that casters are actually casting their spells more often. We’ll also have to look at crowd control, because once you can’t interrupt every Polymorph being cast, you’re going to spend a lot of time as a sheep. Ghostcrawler has an upcoming blog in which he speculates about this issue a bit more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Players’ skill level in PvP between rated and random battlegrounds are very different. Could a personal rating system such as the one in Starcraft II be implemented so similar level players can be matched up? – ?? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: We have a personal rating system for Rated Battlegrounds. We don’t use it in the random Battlegrounds because random Battlegrounds are engineered for speed of matchmaking, not for setting up perfectly balanced teams. We do evaluate gear with random BGs, which often (but certainly not always) correlates with your skill. The system begins to break down when you're balancing skill versus how quickly people want to just get in and play. Creating a system that's more stringent in how it chooses players means longer wait times, so we try to strike a balance with random Battlegrounds to have some factors (gear) but not so much that queue times become even longer. It's also worth stating that the matchmaking employed by StarCraft II is just much simpler than what it would require to assemble a viable Battleground team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: CC used to be the big thing for arena, but now it’s all about damage. Is it the direction you are taking at the moment? – Thatis (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: If crowd control really was as weak in Arenas as you’re claiming, then Holy paladins would be the healer of choice and Resto druids wouldn’t have much of a role. But the Entangling Roots and Cyclone of the druid make a huge difference in Arena, and we see a lot of healing druids.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we think there has to be a place for both crowd control and damage. It can be just as frustrating to be chained from a fear to a poly to a stun without having an answer as it can be to die to two dudes killing you in a few GCDs without an answer. We don’t want Arena in particular to be all about which comp has the best layering of crowd controls that don’t share diminishing returns, because that greatly lowers the number of viable comps out there (and why rogue-mage-priest dominated in earlier seasons). We have taken steps this season already to nerf both out of control damage and excessive crowd control for some classes.<br />
<br />
The best thing you can do is just keep providing feedback when you think something is broken. Many other players will disagree with you, and at times so will we. The signal to noise ratio for PvP balance is frankly always going to be bad, and the design calls are extremely subjective. We are constantly amazed that some players playing very powerful specs perceive themselves as weak or interpret very gentle nerfs as soul-crushing. That doesn’t mean that we’re never going to listen, but it does mean the burden of convincing us something is broken is going to be high, probably higher than it is for PvE. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Warrior damage is currently game-breakingly out of control and looking at the 4.1 patch notes it is only set to get worse. Your attempts at toning down the burst from Colossus Smash will have very little effect on high armor targets and absolutley no effect on medium to low armor targets, factor in the compensation you have given to Slam, Overpower and Mortal Strike and it ultimately leads to a significant damage increase. With warrior damage already absurdly high and a resilience nerf in the works what is the reasoning behind these changes? – Albany (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: This question was most likely written before the most recent 4.1 patch notes, but we think it was totally valid at the time it was written. We were in a tricky spot with warriors where we couldn’t nerf their burst damage without affecting their sustained PvE damage. A few things contributed to this, Colossus Smash for sure, but also the new design for Heroic Strike, allowing them to sandwich in extra damage on the same GCD as Mortal Strike or Raging Blow. We finally bit the bullet and made Colossus Smash work differently in PvP and PvE. That type of separation is always a last resort for us, but we feel like it was the right call in this case. We also toned down the base amount of Fury mastery while keeping mastery scaling the same, and compensated them with auto attack damage. We also fixed a sneaky bug where trinket effects that were not intended to stack, were stacking. Despite some of the more hyperbolic responses, we think warriors will continue to use Colossus Smash in PvP. They may think about it a little more before using on a clothie, and we’re actually fine with that. (It’s still probably a 13% damage increase vs. cloth.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can I hear your thoughts of the survival abilities of the Warlock on PvP? – Mccoll (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Overall, we think they’re fine. Warlocks in PvP often compare themselves to Shadow priest, and to be fair, Shadow priests have some very potent emergency buttons, particularly Dispersion. Warlocks have good self-healing (which also to be fair, was nerfed recently), abilities like Demonic Circle and fears that are good for both offense and defense. Once Shadow priests lose their defensive dispel capabilities, we think they will be less versatile and their entire package will be more comparable to warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Balance druids are widely recognized as deficient in PvP. Can you describe your motivation for nerfing Balance druids' burst damage, crowd control, and self-healing in 4.1? This seems like a lot, given that you have acknowledged that Balance druids are currently weak in Arena (during your first Q&amp;A). (It would be great if you could speak generally to what your vision or plan is for this class, in PvP. Some players believe that Blizzard does not intend for feral or balance druids to be played in arena. Please tell us for the record that this is not true!) Thank you. – Jynks (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Last week the words actually used were that Balance druids struggle in Arena. They are exceptional in Battlegrounds. But Balance druids cast hard spells a lot, which are more likely to be interrupted in Arenas. They do good damage in Battlegrounds when they can dot multiple targets, but those are more likely to be dispelled in Arenas. Despite those weaknesses, Starsurge needed to be nerfed. Broken spells shouldn’t make up for being weak in Arena.<br />
<br />
We want Feral and Balance to be played in PvP and ideally in Arena. It is hard to make every spec equally viable in Arenas without giving everyone all the same set of tools, which was part of the entire genesis towards the emphasis on Rated Battlegrounds for Cataclysm. We know some players scratch their heads when we nerf Balance and Feral in PvP because they historically haven’t been as highly represented as some other specs. However, it’s not cool for a spec to be super annoying or frustrating to play against just because they aren’t common. But to answer your question for the record, yes we want them to be viable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Elemental Shaman are rarely seen in high rating Arena teams nowadays. I want to know the thoughts and opinions of the Dev. Team regarding the PVP abilities of the Elemental Shaman. Can I expect any improvement? – ?? (Korea), Mythren (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: As with Balance above, Elemental was hurt by several of the Cataclysm changes. They hard cast spells a lot in a world where every melee spec (and many casters) have a reliable interrupt. (And as we’re saying elsewhere, we think interrupts are too good in PvP overall). Likewise, Elemental is hurt by dispels. Our intent was to make dispels more expensive, but that hasn’t really toned them down as much as we wanted. Long-term, as with the interrupts, we do need to chill dispels out even more. But certainly dispelling Flame Shock hurts Elemental’s damage a lot. Similarly, Elemental’s big claim to fame in Lich King was how much burst they could do in a small window, and we have toned that down a lot with the larger health pools that players have. Finally, the Heroism / Bloodlust buff was once mandatory for 5v5 brackets, and obviously isn’t any longer. Elemental could probably benefit from another survivability cooldown. Elemental Mastery doesn’t fit that niche as well as we’d like, since you need it for offense as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why do hunter traps continue to be resisted when the hunter is both spell pen capped, and specced 2/2 into Survival Tactics? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: It’s just a technical limitation. The way the code works, the traps are objects and not part of the player. We can calculate how much damage they should do based on player stats, but it is currently impossible for them to inherit things like spell pen. Spell Penetration does nothing for your traps. We don’t even have a way to make them always hit, because then they would always hit, even against a stealthed rogue for instance (which we’re sure is a solution hunters would be perfectly happy with). We know it’s not a very satisfying answer, but at the end of the day, World of Warcraft is a piece of software and given that we have some of the best programmers in the industry working on it, there aren’t any simple solutions that are going to fix this problem in the short term. It is absolutely a problem though and we do want to fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: The healing abilities of hybrid classes are being severely limited (eg. Retribution Paladin, Shadow Priest). Compared to this why do DPS Classes such as Rogue, Warlock have strong healing capabilities? Can I get some explanations for this? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Our definition of hybrid is a class that can respec to tank or heal. That versatility is much less relevant in PvP than in PvE. So it isn’t all our intention that classes who have a healing talent tree are good healers at all times and more than you might expect Restoration or Balance druids to be tanky just because they have a tank spec.<br />
<br />
We don’t specify a set amount of self-healing and try to adjust everyone to hit those targets. Instead we balance specs around their entire package. If rogues die a lot, then we can explore the option of increasing their mitigation, giving them stronger survival cooldowns, or increasing their self-healing. We found that rogues were one of the most painful classes to level, so when we revamped them for Cataclysm, we wanted to make sure they didn’t have to stop and eat or bandage every few pulls. Warlocks self healing did get nerfed, but also remember that their resource mechanic is burning health to generate mana, so they need a way to replenish that health.<br />
<br />
Finally, hybrids can absolutely swing the outcome of battles with their self or off-healing. Feral druids can stop, shift, and heal themselves up. It happens all the time (though obviously not while being focused). That doesn’t mean that those specs are supposed to be chain healing the whole time (that’s what actual healers do).<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Frost Mage and Blood Death Knight are almost unbeatable in PvP situations. Do you have any plan to adjust balance issues regarding the two Classes? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: The kit of the Frost mage is to have a lot of control and emergency buttons. This gives them a high skill cap, both in that it can be hard to stop a good Frost mage and it can be hard for less skilled PvP players to handle even a decent Frost mage. At the high end of PvP, we think Frost mages are balanced. It’s everything below that where they can be frustrating to handle. We need to figure out ways to affect the latter without affecting the former. One solution is to take some of their control away, but make some of the remaining abilities undispellable. Those spells are always dispelled in high-end games, but less often in lower-end games.<br />
<br />
With the exception of a few (kind of silly) dual Blood comps in the 2v2 bracket, we see most of the Blood DK complaints when they are Battleground flag carriers. Tanks are hard to kill – that’s their thing. When tanks do obnoxious amounts of damage in PvP in addition to high survivability, as happened in some of the Lich King seasons, that feels broken. In Cataclysm, their damage is a lot lower in PvP, but their survivability is high, which feels more appropriate. We did nerf the Glyph of Dark Succor to keep it from being abusive. We’d rather the role of tanks in PvP be as flag carriers and defenders rather than the dude chasing you around trying to kill you.<br />
<br />

Raid PUGs<br />
Raid bosses aren’t designed with pick up raids in mind, but the bosses should get more challenging as a raid progresses through the instance. Naxxramas is perhaps not a good benchmark to set raiding expectations against for a couple of reasons. It was content that a number of players were already familiar with, and it was also tuned to a difficulty that was a bit lower than we would have preferred.<br />
<br />
I too vividly recall the start of Burning Crusade, and pick up raids were anything but common at the start of that expansion. In fact, the idea of a pick up raid was flatly laughable for quite a while. They didn't really appear with any regularity until the mid-portions of the Burning Crusade expansion, and only after most of the participating players knew the fights very well, or just overgeared them by a pretty wide margin. Even in Wrath of the Lich King, pick up raids didn't start becoming super common until a tier or two of content had already been released. The scenario you mentioned in your original post, of constant pick up raid spam in trade, didn't really occur until a bit later.<br />
<br />
We are starting to see pick up raids form for current content even though the next tier of gear hasn't been released yet. In that light, progression appears to be on track.<br />
<br />
On the subject of progression, in 4.1 Valor Points should become more rapidly accessible too. As more players acquire gear of high ilevel, and as average gear levels rise as a result, it will be easier to find effective pick up raiding groups.<br />
<br />
Designing raids with PUGs in mind<br />
Raiding is the pinnacle of what can be achieved in World of Warcraft; on the PvE side, anyway. With that in mind, we feel that those encounters should be epic, with epic challenges and rewards to match. Cutting edge raiding should present a real challenge and feel rewarding for players who are dedicated to facing down that content on its own terms.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, we fully expect that raid content will become available to a larger population of players as time goes on. Our intent has always been that players will be able to see more and more content with less and less coordination as time goes on. Ghostcrawler’s recent blog on raid progression (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2452061#blog) states that very specifically, and it will result either from the natural proliferation of gear as time goes on, or if that’s not substantial enough, direct adjustments to difficulty. That’s really the underlining intent of our raid progression philosophy in Cataclysm: to strike a better balance between the hardcore raiding of yesteryear and the more accessible raiding of Wrath.<br />
<br />
The solution comes down to timing. We want to keep it epic for the high end raiders, but also ensure that content becomes more accessible over time. (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164963/i-quit[Source[/url])url<br />

why because he feels the general play style of the game towards pvp is garbage? it is garbage and those answers posted by blizzard just go to show how out of touch they are with the game, and pvp in general. easily fixed problems that should be addressed are ignored and changes are made to classes that are already suffering while other classes go on about there merry way... but what would i know... im just a noob.</div></div><hr />

Time to face facts: <br />
...World PvP is dead, gone and will never recover <br />
...There will never be a 1v1 PvP Balance<br />
...WOW = world of face-book craft = get social or get out (sad)<br />
<br />
WOW PvP is now officially 100% based on RNG, OP class mechanics and nothing else.<br />
No skill required... an 8 year old could do it...<br />
<br />
1. World PvP is dead, gone and will never recover - Yeah, it is. Shame. It was fun.<br />
2. There will never be a 1v1 PvP Balance - No, there won't. It's impossible, why do people ask for the impossible? What do you want? A attack, defend, heal, run button, for every class? With the same power. It would be a game about who would strike first, or who would know when to press Heal on the right times, instead of Attack.<br />
3. WOW = world of face-book craft = get social or get out (sad) - MMO - MASS MULTIPLAYER ONLINE - MASS - MULTIPLAYER. MULTIPLAYER. Got that? Go play a solo, regular RPG if you don't want to play in a MASS - MULTIPLAYER - ONLINE - RPG.<br />

<br />
1.&quot;there is less burst damage from Balance druids&quot; thats all balance druids actually have &gt;.&gt; they are literally one of the worst pvp spec in the game to play due to limited CD's and no real snare solutions like other casters.<br />
<br />
2.&quot;Broken spells shouldn’t make up for being weak in Arena&quot; it is when your representation in 2's for balance is 1/6 that of restro and 1/5th of feral and roughly the same in 3v3(i don't count 5v5 as it may as well be a battleground at that point).As for the comment of them doing better in bgs...yeah vs what maybe a non-frost mage?every melee tears balance apart and its made worse by the fact they ahve little to no escape tools and are as fat as a barn with a sign that says &quot;free HK here&quot;<br />
<br />
3.&quot;Feral druids can stop, shift, and heal themselves up&quot;at the expense of all of their mana and in current ptr ret can't hold a candle to any other hybrid that can heal itself in equal gear,the wog 20 second nerf was just a excuse for kalgan to do his pally hate dance he does every fucking expansion &gt;.&gt;.<br />
<br />
4.&quot;At the high end of PvP, we think Frost mages are balanced&quot;kalgan must be writing this ,becuase only that tard could make such a stupid statement.in 2s we have 800ish frost mages ranked over the 2000 rating with the trend going up.The next highest are shadow priests /locks in the 350/450 range each witht he rest of the caster specs under 200.over all brackets frost mages have 2500 over 2000 rating with the next highest casters being about 1000 behind,balanced my ass.<br />
<br />
5.&quot;This gives them a high skill cap&quot;yeah i know 5-7 different melee escapes is not enough vs a ret paladins 1 stun and instantly spell stolen hof right?My brother who cannot even spell the word soup gets on my frost mage that hes never played before and gets 1-3rd on damage done in BG's and has gotten as high as 1900 in arenas with another frost mage with no resilience on either.yep massive skill cap!</div></div><hr />

seriously what are the developers paid for ? slacking ? specially the part where they can not program the hunter trap to hit (or be affected by the spell pen) [i am not a hunter] .. which i consider a joke <br />

<br />
Try not taking it out of context next time.<br />
<br />
Frost Mages are balanced on the high end, and if you disagree with that, you're probably ranked 1400 or lower and/or are bad at this game. Did you even read the post? Or did your eyes glaze over with rage once you read that fragment of a sentence? Go to the Mage forums and ask if they think they're overpowered, because you're going to get a resounding &quot;no&quot; (along with a million yes's from other classes), since dispels (which exist in any serious arena/BG team) completely wreck our control AND damage to the point of complete frustration. But hey, better watch out for those serious 5k unfrozen Ice Lances! <br />
<br />
They are however, looking at ways to remedy the lower end, which was mentioned in that post (hence why I assume you didn't even read it). Whether they do it or not is a different story, but you should probably grow up a bit and learn how to read. Blanket nerfing Frost Mages would put them into non-existance. While I'm sure there are some kids that would think this is perfectly fine, it's actually not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Q:Is it a possibility that the premade group requirement will be dropped from Rated Battlegrounds, allowing players to queue for a Random Rated Battleground? I'm sure many people would be ok with the inherent risk and disadvantage of grouping with random players for rated content if it meant they could at least make use of the rating system. – Gëtmastiffd (North America/ANZ), Kaymac (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A. Not gonna happen<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:Why can't we have a pure, straight up, unadulterated Death Match style Battleground? - ???? ???? (Taiwan), Gulantor (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: We don't like the idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:Arena Skirmishes: What happened to them? They were a useful tool in trying new compositions, testing out a new teammate, or just having some fun during downtime. Wargames are nice, but did skirmishes have to go in order for them to be implemented? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ), Nølfen (Europe [French]), Jinusek (Europe [English]), Whoohoo (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: Not coming back, use Wargames.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: In Cataclysm, PvP fights were supposed to be slow and everyone should spend longer in a wounded state. But from what I’m seeing, healers are still able to bring someone up from 1% to 100% in 2 or 3 global CDs. So it comes down back to the WOTLK style, either you burst someone in a CD and damage spike, or you need a setup with tons of CC. There simply is not a state where someone is at 50% health and you can keep him around that way with your damage. He will be at 100% in the next 2 global CDs. Any plans to address this? – Noidealol (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: Healing in PvP is fine, l2p.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will guilds focused on PvP be able to progress and have rewards just like guilds focused on PvE?/ Will it be possible in the future to advance guild reputation through PvP? – Smrt (Europe [German]), Ypsen (Europe [French])<br />
<br />
A: In 4.1 you can earn guild XP and reputation from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Honorable Kills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: With the proliferation of spell interrupts and other control mechanisms, and the ever-increasing value of mobility, how do the developers plan to successfully move casters away from instant casts and make hard casting in PvP more viable? – Maldramere (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Ghostcrawler will write a blog about it soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Players’ skill level in PvP between rated and random battlegrounds are very different. Could a personal rating system such as the one in Starcraft II be implemented so similar level players can be matched up? – ?? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: CC used to be the big thing for arena, but now it’s all about damage. Is it the direction you are taking at the moment? – Thatis (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: Arenas are fine, l2p.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Warrior damage is currently game-breakingly out of control and looking at the 4.1 patch notes it is only set to get worse. Your attempts at toning down the burst from Colossus Smash will have very little effect on high armor targets and absolutley no effect on medium to low armor targets, factor in the compensation you have given to Slam, Overpower and Mortal Strike and it ultimately leads to a significant damage increase. With warrior damage already absurdly high and a resilience nerf in the works what is the reasoning behind these changes? – Albany (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: We'll fix it in 4.1<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can I hear your thoughts of the survival abilities of the Warlock on PvP? – Mccoll (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Locks are fine, l2p.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Balance druids are widely recognized as deficient in PvP. Can you describe your motivation for nerfing Balance druids' burst damage, crowd control, and self-healing in 4.1? This seems like a lot, given that you have acknowledged that Balance druids are currently weak in Arena (during your first Q&amp;A). (It would be great if you could speak generally to what your vision or plan is for this class, in PvP. Some players believe that Blizzard does not intend for feral or balance druids to be played in arena. Please tell us for the record that this is not true!) Thank you. – Jynks (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Boomkins are fine, l2p.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Elemental Shaman are rarely seen in high rating Arena teams nowadays. I want to know the thoughts and opinions of the Dev. Team regarding the PVP abilities of the Elemental Shaman. Can I expect any improvement? – ?? (Korea), Mythren (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: We agree, but probably won't do anything about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why do hunter traps continue to be resisted when the hunter is both spell pen capped, and specced 2/2 into Survival Tactics? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Technical issue, won't be fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: The healing abilities of hybrid classes are being severely limited (eg. Retribution Paladin, Shadow Priest). Compared to this why do DPS Classes such as Rogue, Warlock have strong healing capabilities? Can I get some explanations for this? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Hybrids are fine, l2p.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Frost Mage and Blood Death Knight are almost unbeatable in PvP situations. Do you have any plan to adjust balance issues regarding the two Classes? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: &quot;At the high end of PvP, we think Frost mages are balanced.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: Overall, we think they’re fine. Warlocks in PvP often compare themselves to Shadow priest, and to be fair, Shadow priests have some very potent emergency buttons, particularly Dispersion. Warlocks have good self-healing (which also to be fair, was nerfed recently), abilities like Demonic Circle and fears that are good for both offense and defense. Once Shadow priests lose their defensive dispel capabilities, we think they will be less versatile and their entire package will be more comparable to warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz doesnt seem to have a single clue about locks.<br />
1) We also have demo and destro spec, not every lock plays a shadowpriest copy.<br />
2) What selfhealing nerf? Fel armor u mean? We don't use it in pvp as affly. <br />
3) Fear being good cc? Seriously, a cc thats both dispellable, shares dr with 10 other abilities, breaks on dmg and half of the classes have a fear immunity.<br />
4) Even shadowpriest without dispell will do better as lock due higher dmg and survability.<br />
<br />
Just proven, blizz doesnt have a single clue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to say, this is way, way off the mark. 1) It's &quot;Massively&quot; not &quot;Mass&quot; 2) Having several thousand people per game world doesn't mean you have to require team-building (LFD demonstrates this clearly). 3) Blizzard's rationale:<br />
<br />
<br />
If you take away the group requirements for Rated Battlegrounds, then you don’t have Rated Battlegrounds – you just have the same old Battlegrounds we’ve always had expect (sic) they now reward the best loot in the game.<br />
<br />
is absurd, and they know it. They had dozens of players submitting suggestions on the old suggestions forum for how to address exactly that, and many of those suggestions were viable. Most of the boiled down to, &quot;make a more nuanced scoreboard for battlegrounds that counts at least a dozen different attributes of battleground performance, normalize and sum: there's your rating for this battleground.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they did that, then no one would have to form a pre-made to succeed and gain rank, and yet it would most certainly not represent free gear.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Reuires battleground rating of 2200 OR personal and team arena rating of 2200 in 3v3 or 5v5 brackets&quot;. There is no team rating required if your personal RBG rating is 2200+, thus having random rated BGs would mean people could get gear from playing with randoms.<br />
<br />
Also, PvE gear from vendors isn't close to being the &quot;best&quot; gear available. Valor gear is comparable to unrated Conquest Point gear.<br />

Time to face facts: <br />
...World PvP is dead, gone and will never recover <br />
...There will never be a 1v1 PvP Balance<br />
...WOW = world of face-book craft = get social or get out (sad)<br />
<br />
WOW PvP is now officially 100% based on RNG, OP class mechanics and nothing else.<br />
No skill required... an 8 year old could do it...<br />
<br />
Don't comment on balance in World of Warcraft until you play Rift, it's about 50 times worse than world of warcraft.<br />

Top 20 there are no mages<br />
top 50 there are 8 mages<br />
then from there mages get more and more abundant...<br />
why? because mages are so effectively countered by good players.<br />
But they're so poorly handled by bad players, thats why they swarm the lower brackets.<br />
<br />
I find it funny that mages are more underrepresented in this season than any other, yet people complain about mages being OP? okay they're gonna beat you 1v1 if you're a melee. okay too bad. sorry they're gonna kick your ass in a BG. But you know what? the more you QQ, the less mages there are going to be and the more rerolls there are scrubbing up your class :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
is absurd, and they know it. They had dozens of players submitting suggestions on the old suggestions forum for how to address exactly that, and many of those suggestions were viable. Most of the boiled down to, &quot;make a more nuanced scoreboard for battlegrounds that counts at least a dozen different attributes of battleground performance, normalize and sum: there's your rating for this battleground.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they did that, then no one would have to form a pre-made to succeed and gain rank, and yet it would most certainly not represent free gear.<br />
<br />
You're right, solo players should have access to high end gear on a silver platter just handed to them for logging in and running around in a BG. BGs shouldn't even reward gear at all, if you want to play solo then go play Dragon Age.</div></div><hr />

You have to realize that with it being an MMO, being in a group with other players is kind of a big thing...If you want solo gameplay, go play something like DragonAge or Fable or something, not an MMORPG.<br />

8 not sharing dr snares are fine? Warrior and feral solo don't stand a chance against any mage. Let's say &quot;OK BUT PVP IS ABOUT PLAYING IN TEAMS, NOT 1V1 L2P&quot; <br />

<br />
I'm playing DCUO, LotRO, and GW. I find each and every one of those more solo-friendly than WoW. GW2 and SW:TOR are also bound to be more solo-friendly than WoW currently is.<br />
<br />
WoW was a benchmark on being solo-friendly and hassle-free when it launched, over 6 years ago. Now, when measured for it's casual and solo friendly nature, it's at best substandard among the better known MMOs. While WoW has become better with the time, the competition advanced even faster, currently eclipsing WoW in specific benchmarks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were given stuff to do at max-level. Taking raiding back to Vanilla or BC days is fine, but why not just give casual raiders an easy ZG/Karazhan/Naxxramas dungeon to hurl themselves at instead of this head up your own ass elitism</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, PvE gear from vendors isn't close to being the &quot;best&quot; gear available. Valor gear is comparable to unrated Conquest Point gear.<br />
<br />
Lastly, to answer all the people looking for a Deathmatch BG...it's called Arena.<br />
<br />
Unless Blizzard changed plans and I didn't notice, the only piece of gear that need ratings and is an improvement over the ones that don't require ratings is the weapon.

<br />
Because of PvE. If that was not the case, every raider on interrupt duty would be forced to cap hit, thus removing gearing freedom.<br />
After all, having the risk of an interrupt missing, in raids, means the raid is risking a wipe based exclusively on a few random rolls, no matter how good the players are. Which is not exactly fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Event tho the first 6 US teams have a mage in them and players have been posting everyday since Cata that Frost Mages have too many CCs in pvp...but hey, Mages are fine in PVP.<br />
And I just got banned by Baschyok because apparently one of my post was 'non-constructive' which is basically an open door for anything posted on their forums. Don t like a player's post? Ban them for non-constructive comment for 3 days so you don t have to deal with issues that person raised and make sure to delete the post(s) as well.<br />
<br />
The dev team handling pvp has been under fire since Cata with the massive Failure that TB has been. And it took them 2+ month to fix some of the issues even tho during beta we reported all these issues...they still made it live. PVP in wow is fun for random BGs on weekend when you get instant queues...otherwise world pvp is dead, rated BGs are meh and arenas are a niche.<br />
<br />
Players have been asking for years for a tug of war that is NOT instanced...you think they would listen and also bring back old AV without reinforcements but no, the people that have been yelling what they want in pvp for the last 4 years are being dealt with by a team made of deaf devs (who probably pve on their mages).</div></div><hr />

Raiding is the pinnacle of what can be achieved in World of Warcraft..<br />
You are missing the big picture. You have created a game where raiding is the only endgame content. There are no alternatives. We have 2 entirely separate tiers of raiding catered to the hardcore and 0 for the rest. If the endgame content is not playable for the average, those people quit.

If you are in the same spot for 2 seconds as a Mage then you deserve to die.<br />

You have too many CCs/Snares that is why you are OP. The fact that a poll somewhere came out with people thinking Mages are the second easiest to kill does not make it fact, it is called &quot;appeal to popularity&quot; just like a poll saying that Britney Spears makes good music. The fact that many people may say so because they are fans do not make Britney making good music.<br />
<br />
Mages have been buffed all patches since Cata. It seems with the CMs responses that they are not playing the same pvp I am. As a lock...if I get jumped by a mage in a BG I am dead. My trinket is useless, no class should be able to take you from 100% to 0 locking you out of your spells and cc'ing you all the way. Being a lock I know how fear was used a long time ago before diminishing returns and immunes were put in. Right now mages are the warlocks of 2006 and it is pretty obvious that the PVP devs play mages in PVE.</div></div><hr />

Raid bosses aren’t designed with pick up raids in mind, but the bosses should get more challenging as a raid progresses through the instance. Naxxramas is perhaps not a good benchmark to set raiding expectations against for a couple of reasons. It was content that a number of players were already familiar with, and it was also tuned to a difficulty that was a bit lower than we would have preferred.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But Mr blizzard, wasn't Naxx remade because so little people experienced it? I also don't understand why they tuned it lower than they would of liked. it was their decision entirely, why the hell didn't they tune it how they wanted? <br />

I'm sure many people would be ok with the inherent risk and disadvantage of grouping with random players for rated content if it meant they could at least make use of the rating system. – Gëtmastiffd (North America/ANZ), Kaymac (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A. Then it would just be a normal Battleground...except you get awesome rewards for it. Who the fuck would queue for a &quot;unrated&quot; Battleground then?<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:Why can't we have a pure, straight up, unadulterated Death Match style Battleground? - ???? ???? (Taiwan), Gulantor (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Because we already have those. It's called Arena, and anything more than a 5v5 is basically a gigantic clusterfuck. There's no skill in AV when 40v40 smash faces in the Field of Strife. The idea of a Battleground is to put multiple objectives, so teams split up into smaller parties, rather than go &quot;HERP DERP&quot; in the middle until someone wins. Can you IMAGINE an unrated Deathmatch style battleground? It would be absolutely horrible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:Arena Skirmishes: What happened to them? They were a useful tool in trying new compositions, testing out a new teammate, or just having some fun during downtime. Wargames are nice, but did skirmishes have to go in order for them to be implemented? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ), Nølfen (Europe [French]), Jinusek (Europe [English]), Whoohoo (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: These were hardly used (basing this on Blizzard stats, which are probably better than YOUR stats, surprisingly), and because we are trying to support Rated Battlegrounds, we decided that Wargames was a better option to have in the game. If we find time to put both in the game, we will. Until then, why don't you just go play normal Arena's to &quot;test out a comp&quot; or what shit you want to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: In Cataclysm, PvP fights were supposed to be slow and everyone should spend longer in a wounded state. But from what I’m seeing, healers are still able to bring someone up from 1% to 100% in 2 or 3 global CDs. So it comes down back to the WOTLK style, either you burst someone in a CD and damage spike, or you need a setup with tons of CC. There simply is not a state where someone is at 50% health and you can keep him around that way with your damage. He will be at 100% in the next 2 global CDs. Any plans to address this? – Noidealol (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: Healing never happens like that, unless a healer is free-casting (you're failing at CCing or Interrupting), or has used cooldowns (read: NS, ToL, GoAK etc). Not to mention the fact that if healers are CONSTANTLY healing in this manner, they will oom in no time at all. Oh, unless you don't dispel Divine Plea, or let them drink, or don't kill Mana Tide Totem. In which case, you're an idiot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will guilds focused on PvP be able to progress and have rewards just like guilds focused on PvE?/ Will it be possible in the future to advance guild reputation through PvP? – Smrt (Europe [German]), Ypsen (Europe [French])<br />
<br />
A: In 4.1 you can earn guild XP and reputation from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Honorable Kills. But hey, let's not focus on this improvement. I'm far too busy crying about all these other answers I'm taking out of context.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: With the proliferation of spell interrupts and other control mechanisms, and the ever-increasing value of mobility, how do the developers plan to successfully move casters away from instant casts and make hard casting in PvP more viable? – Maldramere (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: We agree this is a big issue we are trying to address in future patches (obviously a major overhaul in Patch 4.1 is a terrible idea). We discussed this a bit, and GC will be addressing this in a blog very soon. This especially affects those hard-casting classes like Balance Druid and Elemental Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Players’ skill level in PvP between rated and random battlegrounds are very different. Could a personal rating system such as the one in Starcraft II be implemented so similar level players can be matched up? – ?? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: The system currently in the game is way more sophisticated than the one in Starcraft 2. Probably because there are additional factors in a MMORPG, whereas in an RTS it's pretty damn simple to match up 2 equally skilled players/teams.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: CC used to be the big thing for arena, but now it’s all about damage. Is it the direction you are taking at the moment? – Thatis (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: CC isn't underpowered, retards. If it WAS underpowered, why the hell isn't Hpaladin the best PvP healer? (wait, they've got that sweet melee range stun, right?) Resto Druids and Shamans are both incredibly potent in all forms of Arena (notice the question is about ARENA), as you can see if you bother to look at ANY arena stats, so this Taiwanese guy is wrong. Dumb question. CC is as powerful as it has ever been.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Warrior damage is currently game-breakingly out of control and looking at the 4.1 patch notes it is only set to get worse. Your attempts at toning down the burst from Colossus Smash will have very little effect on high armor targets and absolutley no effect on medium to low armor targets, factor in the compensation you have given to Slam, Overpower and Mortal Strike and it ultimately leads to a significant damage increase. With warrior damage already absurdly high and a resilience nerf in the works what is the reasoning behind these changes? – Albany (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: It's already been fixed, and we've managed to do this without breaking PvE damage (imagine the tears if we did that hey?). We'll see how this goes with further testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can I hear your thoughts of the survival abilities of the Warlock on PvP? – Mccoll (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: You've got Demo Port, excellent self healing (not as good as previously, of course) as well as similar tools to a Spriest, who are quite strong at the moment. Spriest is replacing alot of Warlocks, but with the change to dispels this should open up more positions for Warlocks (who aren't underpowered, stfu).<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Balance druids are widely recognized as deficient in PvP. Can you describe your motivation for nerfing Balance druids' burst damage, crowd control, and self-healing in 4.1? This seems like a lot, given that you have acknowledged that Balance druids are currently weak in Arena (during your first Q&amp;A). (It would be great if you could speak generally to what your vision or plan is for this class, in PvP. Some players believe that Blizzard does not intend for feral or balance druids to be played in arena. Please tell us for the record that this is not true!) Thank you. – Jynks (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Hard casting class. Interrupts. Ghostcrawler. Blog. We already went over this. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Elemental Shaman are rarely seen in high rating Arena teams nowadays. I want to know the thoughts and opinions of the Dev. Team regarding the PVP abilities of the Elemental Shaman. Can I expect any improvement? – ?? (Korea), Mythren (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: The same as boomkins. Hard casting. Blog. GC. Interrupts. Boomkin and Elemental are practically the same spec in terms of how they deal damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why do hunter traps continue to be resisted when the hunter is both spell pen capped, and specced 2/2 into Survival Tactics? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: This is impossible to fix given our current limitations. Hopefully we can find a way to fix it, but until then there isn't alot we can do. Inc Hunters crying everywhere like they always do unless they're receiving massive buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: The healing abilities of hybrid classes are being severely limited (eg. Retribution Paladin, Shadow Priest). Compared to this why do DPS Classes such as Rogue, Warlock have strong healing capabilities? Can I get some explanations for this? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Hybrids aren't meant to have omgorgasm off heals. Not to mention the fact that only they can OFFHEAL. DPS classes CANNOT OFFHEAL. Understand? Self-healing =/= off-healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Frost Mage and Blood Death Knight are almost unbeatable in PvP situations. Do you have any plan to adjust balance issues regarding the two Classes? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: At top end PvP, Frost Mages ARE balanced (ofc, if you don't believe this I'm almost definitely sure you're 1600 rated). The issue here is that we need to make Frost PvP weaker at lower brackets (lower skill levels), without fucking over high rated players (higher skill levels). Of course, being that 90% of the WoW community are morons, they can't understand this and will just be like &quot;OMFG SO UNFAIR FRST MAGES SO OP&quot; without bothering to dispel any of their abilities or realise this. Rather than cry about it, perhaps you could offer a solution? What's that? You don't have a quick fix? You just came here to cry?<br />
<br />
I fixed all those &quot;replies&quot; you made Shadowgale. Maybe next time work on that reading comprehension?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know each character is limited to one pet at a time, so each trap would replace your pet and all other traps. Also, if you make them guardians (uncontrollable pets) then they don't inherit stats and it defeats the point. It actually is a hard problem. I think the solution is eventually going to be changing the code for object to allow them to inherit more stats, but that likely won't happen any time soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The MM in MMORPG = Massively Multiplayer <br />
<br />
That doesn't look like Cooperative Multiplayer or Forced Team Multiplayer<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game<br />
<br />
&quot;Massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) is a genre of role-playing video games in which a very large number of players interact with one another within a virtual game world.&quot; Odd, it doesn't state that they are forced to be social or join a team, just that they can interact. &quot;MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player RPGs by the number of players, and by the game's persistent world, usually hosted by the game's publisher, which continues to exist and evolve while the player is away from the game.&quot; Yet again, nothing on forced cooperation or forced socialization.<br />
<br />
P.S. Before you cry &quot;But it also says&quot;:: &quot;In addition, most MMOs require some degree of teamwork for parts of the game&quot; It says &quot;most&quot; as in it is not a requirement in it being an MMORPG. So claiming that an MMORPG means forced teamplay/socialization isn't true and neither is acting like it is supposed to be a social network.</div></div><hr />

What are you going to prove by boycotting a Q&amp;A? Blizzard only gains time if you do this. I dont think you understand the true purpose of boycotting. <br />

<br />
Yes. It was informative and revealing, but not for the questions asked. Rather it showed that Blizzard has no clue of the state of PvP at present, and is so out of touch with its player base that its scary. Expect every nerf to your class mentioned in 4.1 to go live, and not to get any compensation later on. Those classes (mage/warrior/rogue/Priest) that are currently doing well/not got any nerfs will stay as they are, or may get buffed. This is because they are &quot;pures&quot; and not hybrids.

That means you should stop calling your game an MMO (massively multiplayer online). Wow is now a stupid HGO (hardcore gamers only) game.<br />
<br />
Raiding is the pinnacle of what can be achieved in World of Warcraft..<br />
You are missing the big picture. You have created a game where raiding is the only endgame content. There are no alternatives. We have 2 entirely separate tiers of raiding catered to the hardcore and 0 for the rest. If the endgame content is not playable for the average, those people quit. It doesn't matter how bad average players are, if you can't get them into raids, your &quot;MMO&quot; fails, not them.<br />
<br />
So... you want raids that can be killed by pugs so that everyone feels good.. ? NO shit.. that's ridiculous</div></div><hr />

MY ASS<br />
<br />
I know I don't care about this game. But still, why is it that Blizzard likes to make it seem like lying and bullshiting is an Olympic sport?<br />
<br />
To even fancy the idea that WoW is balanced in it's current state is ludicrous with skillgate mechanics built into like this, such as everything the frost mage does. I've had physical fistfights that were more 'balanced' than this games oh so prizely competitive part. And I know it's wrong for me to rant about a game I don't play anymore, but holy shit. I actually LIKED the game once and feel this is like a match made in hell or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
This post really was a long, stupid trainwreck, so instead of quoting the tl;dr drek I give you the following statement, which will give you the idea of the post's original content. If you want to see it for yourself, it's linked.<br />

&quot;If the conglomeration of Blizzard had a physical ass, I would kiss it. Hell, I'd do more to it if needed.&quot;<br />

Shadowgale's post on page 2 captures what the all this lawyerspeak came out to, imo. And we all know how this nonsense is going to turn out, so there's no reason to debate or defend them after all this bs that's being shoved down our...your throats.<br />
<br />
You know what? Keep playing in your fantasy world. Keeps you occupied with the illusion of playing something competitive/worth a damn while also staying the hell away from me.</div></div><hr />

Even mages themselves admit they're OP. They also claim they're nerfing warriors, but they're only nerfing colossus smash unless I'm wrong. Overpower, Slam, and Mortal Strike are getting beefy buffs. This is not what they needed... So we have the blues claiming 2 DPS classes are being nerfed and are balanced yet they're buffing them both. I know for Frost they're buffing them in what looks like PVE. They need to suck it up and admit that for pure DPS classes at least 1 spec is just going to have to suck at PVP or PVE for the sake of balance. No class needs 3 viable DPS trees, it's rediculous and impossible because unless they do the exact same damage everyone will just spec whichever one is slightly ahead anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate to point this to you but playing in a MMO does not mean you HAVE to be with people or grouped. I think like a lot of people that you misunderstood the meaning of the term Multiplayer. Having other people around you in a virtual environment does not always mean having to play with others. Just saying...<br />
<br />
Further more the content for 1 to 85 is tailored for solo players. Also according to guilds stats about 1.1 millions people are in about 44.000 guilds that have at least downed Magmaw vs 12 million total subscriptions. ie I believe these numbers mean far more people play casually and do not raid.</div></div><hr />

So claiming that an MMORPG means forced teamplay/socialization isn't true and neither is acting like it is supposed to be a social network.<br />
<br />
and in fact it is not a requirement, you can do alot of activities in solo: quest, achivement, heroics, BGs, rep; but when it come to endgame like raids or rated bgs you need an organized group or at last you need to wait until the gear available through solo activities (valor point) is high enought (see patch 4.1 and 4.2 when the current tier become available at the valor vendor). It's only a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: We didn’t cut Skirmishes because they were flawed. We just thought we’d get more bang for the buck out of Wargames. While some players enjoyed Skirmishes, we can tell you that overall they were used very rarely. We would have kept them if it had been relatively easy to do so, and we may add them back someday, but it’s just not a huge priority based on their previous popularity.<br />
<br />
BULLSHIT!<br />
<br />
I SO agree with you! They are indirectly saying that War games are more popular than Arena Skirmishes were and as a very experienced player I am 98.99% sure that is pure bullshit. There were always people playing in 2v2 and 3v3 skirmishes and I really don't see or know people who are playing War games. Besides, if you want to play War Games you could have just went to Nagrand Arena/Gurubashi Arena/ Bledge Arena to duel your friends.

Seriously traps are magic can be dispelled in like 1 second their practically useless in arena not to mention that warriors can just charge out of them. Now they confirm that they are resistable and theirs nothing you can do about it and the fantastic solution for this is? Oh erm well not sure how we can fix this so we'll just forget about it for now.<br />
<br />
It's the same comps in 3s winning all the time with a few exceptions as per every other arena season it's &quot;bring the comp not the player&quot;. Reti pally and warrior in 3s is stupidly op Ret pallys are completely broken they have insane burst with cool downs for about 20 seconds after that they hit like a girl with a wet cloth. I was in a match the other day this is what killed my 3.5k resi hunter: Hammer of wrath 33k &gt; Templar's verdict 28k &gt; Templar's verdict 26k, the rest of the damage came form the warrior in the form of bleeds and insane burst. No amount of healing can stop that and the priest healer can dispell ANY cc that i use and ANY cool downs that my pally healer puts on me. They killed me in about 2 to 3 seconds. I think this season has been one of the most unbalanced in terms of comps your either in a winning comp or your in a loosing comp and their are some class that are just completely broken in arena.<br />

After all, having the risk of an interrupt missing, in raids, means the raid is risking a wipe based exclusively on a few random rolls, no matter how good the players are. Which is not exactly fun.<br />
<br />
Now if you only didn't need a 25ms ping to interrupt most the raid wiping spells in T11. Because having a great internet connection = skill.</div></div><hr />

Every Q &amp; A, done.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the high end of PvP, we think Frost mages are balanced&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah-hahaha!<br />
<br />
Rather intriguing and also stupid assumption. <br />
<br />
For Feral before the 4.0.6 patch the opposite was true.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the high end of PvP, we think Feral druids are underpowered but at lower ends they are overpowered so we will take the following steps <br />
1 - Fear break will be gone from Berserk <br />
2 - Feral would not be allowed to shapeshift out of roots effects anymore<br />
3 - Glyph of Entangling Roots nerfed to the ground<br />
4 - Damage transfer from bleeds to Shred ability<br />
...<br />
<br />
Blizz devs certainly shows total lack of any consideration and thought put into their own actions. <br />
<br />
No respect to the players is shown. They &quot;lie&quot; all the time and most players who are there from vanilla playing either Paladin and Druid have more than enough of Blizz devs arrogance toward player feedback about both classes.<br />

I'm sure many people would be ok with the inherent risk and disadvantage of grouping with random players for rated content if it meant they could at least make use of the rating system. – Gëtmastiffd (North America/ANZ), Kaymac (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A. Then it would just be a normal Battleground...except you get awesome rewards for it. Who the fuck would queue for a &quot;unrated&quot; Battleground then?<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:Why can't we have a pure, straight up, unadulterated Death Match style Battleground? - ???? ???? (Taiwan), Gulantor (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Because we already have those. It's called Arena, and anything more than a 5v5 is basically a gigantic clusterfuck. There's no skill in AV when 40v40 smash faces in the Field of Strife. The idea of a Battleground is to put multiple objectives, so teams split up into smaller parties, rather than go &quot;HERP DERP&quot; in the middle until someone wins. Can you IMAGINE an unrated Deathmatch style battleground? It would be absolutely horrible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:Arena Skirmishes: What happened to them? They were a useful tool in trying new compositions, testing out a new teammate, or just having some fun during downtime. Wargames are nice, but did skirmishes have to go in order for them to be implemented? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ), Nølfen (Europe [French]), Jinusek (Europe [English]), Whoohoo (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: These were hardly used (basing this on Blizzard stats, which are probably better than YOUR stats, surprisingly), and because we are trying to support Rated Battlegrounds, we decided that Wargames was a better option to have in the game. If we find time to put both in the game, we will. Until then, why don't you just go play normal Arena's to &quot;test out a comp&quot; or what shit you want to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: In Cataclysm, PvP fights were supposed to be slow and everyone should spend longer in a wounded state. But from what I’m seeing, healers are still able to bring someone up from 1% to 100% in 2 or 3 global CDs. So it comes down back to the WOTLK style, either you burst someone in a CD and damage spike, or you need a setup with tons of CC. There simply is not a state where someone is at 50% health and you can keep him around that way with your damage. He will be at 100% in the next 2 global CDs. Any plans to address this? – Noidealol (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: Healing never happens like that, unless a healer is free-casting (you're failing at CCing or Interrupting), or has used cooldowns (read: NS, ToL, GoAK etc). Not to mention the fact that if healers are CONSTANTLY healing in this manner, they will oom in no time at all. Oh, unless you don't dispel Divine Plea, or let them drink, or don't kill Mana Tide Totem. In which case, you're an idiot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will guilds focused on PvP be able to progress and have rewards just like guilds focused on PvE?/ Will it be possible in the future to advance guild reputation through PvP? – Smrt (Europe [German]), Ypsen (Europe [French])<br />
<br />
A: In 4.1 you can earn guild XP and reputation from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Honorable Kills. But hey, let's not focus on this improvement. I'm far too busy crying about all these other answers I'm taking out of context.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: With the proliferation of spell interrupts and other control mechanisms, and the ever-increasing value of mobility, how do the developers plan to successfully move casters away from instant casts and make hard casting in PvP more viable? – Maldramere (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: We agree this is a big issue we are trying to address in future patches (obviously a major overhaul in Patch 4.1 is a terrible idea). We discussed this a bit, and GC will be addressing this in a blog very soon. This especially affects those hard-casting classes like Balance Druid and Elemental Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Players’ skill level in PvP between rated and random battlegrounds are very different. Could a personal rating system such as the one in Starcraft II be implemented so similar level players can be matched up? – ?? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: The system currently in the game is way more sophisticated than the one in Starcraft 2. Probably because there are additional factors in a MMORPG, whereas in an RTS it's pretty damn simple to match up 2 equally skilled players/teams.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: CC used to be the big thing for arena, but now it’s all about damage. Is it the direction you are taking at the moment? – Thatis (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: CC isn't underpowered, retards. If it WAS underpowered, why the hell isn't Hpaladin the best PvP healer? (wait, they've got that sweet melee range stun, right?) Resto Druids and Shamans are both incredibly potent in all forms of Arena (notice the question is about ARENA), as you can see if you bother to look at ANY arena stats, so this Taiwanese guy is wrong. Dumb question. CC is as powerful as it has ever been.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Warrior damage is currently game-breakingly out of control and looking at the 4.1 patch notes it is only set to get worse. Your attempts at toning down the burst from Colossus Smash will have very little effect on high armor targets and absolutley no effect on medium to low armor targets, factor in the compensation you have given to Slam, Overpower and Mortal Strike and it ultimately leads to a significant damage increase. With warrior damage already absurdly high and a resilience nerf in the works what is the reasoning behind these changes? – Albany (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: It's already been fixed, and we've managed to do this without breaking PvE damage (imagine the tears if we did that hey?). We'll see how this goes with further testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can I hear your thoughts of the survival abilities of the Warlock on PvP? – Mccoll (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: You've got Demo Port, excellent self healing (not as good as previously, of course) as well as similar tools to a Spriest, who are quite strong at the moment. Spriest is replacing alot of Warlocks, but with the change to dispels this should open up more positions for Warlocks (who aren't underpowered, stfu).<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Balance druids are widely recognized as deficient in PvP. Can you describe your motivation for nerfing Balance druids' burst damage, crowd control, and self-healing in 4.1? This seems like a lot, given that you have acknowledged that Balance druids are currently weak in Arena (during your first Q&amp;A). (It would be great if you could speak generally to what your vision or plan is for this class, in PvP. Some players believe that Blizzard does not intend for feral or balance druids to be played in arena. Please tell us for the record that this is not true!) Thank you. – Jynks (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Hard casting class. Interrupts. Ghostcrawler. Blog. We already went over this. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Elemental Shaman are rarely seen in high rating Arena teams nowadays. I want to know the thoughts and opinions of the Dev. Team regarding the PVP abilities of the Elemental Shaman. Can I expect any improvement? – ?? (Korea), Mythren (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: The same as boomkins. Hard casting. Blog. GC. Interrupts. Boomkin and Elemental are practically the same spec in terms of how they deal damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why do hunter traps continue to be resisted when the hunter is both spell pen capped, and specced 2/2 into Survival Tactics? – Zubzar (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: This is impossible to fix given our current limitations. Hopefully we can find a way to fix it, but until then there isn't alot we can do. Inc Hunters crying everywhere like they always do unless they're receiving massive buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: The healing abilities of hybrid classes are being severely limited (eg. Retribution Paladin, Shadow Priest). Compared to this why do DPS Classes such as Rogue, Warlock have strong healing capabilities? Can I get some explanations for this? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Hybrids aren't meant to have omgorgasm off heals. Not to mention the fact that only they can OFFHEAL. DPS classes CANNOT OFFHEAL. Understand? Self-healing =/= off-healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Frost Mage and Blood Death Knight are almost unbeatable in PvP situations. Do you have any plan to adjust balance issues regarding the two Classes? – ????? (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: At top end PvP, Frost Mages ARE balanced (ofc, if you don't believe this I'm almost definitely sure you're 1600 rated). The issue here is that we need to make Frost PvP weaker at lower brackets (lower skill levels), without fucking over high rated players (higher skill levels). Of course, being that 90% of the WoW community are morons, they can't understand this and will just be like &quot;OMFG SO UNFAIR FRST MAGES SO OP&quot; without bothering to dispel any of their abilities or realise this. Rather than cry about it, perhaps you could offer a solution? What's that? You don't have a quick fix? You just came here to cry?<br />
<br />
I fixed all those &quot;replies&quot; you made Shadowgale. Maybe next time work on that reading comprehension?<br />

I have been playing my warlock for 2 years now and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience, until this change, it has made me ( and I'm sure many others like me) want to go play another game. constantly deciding your changes on the top echelon of players I think is doing you less good than more, since the greater majority of players in wow are not Gladiator material. it appears as if blizzard has lost touch with its player base, or its social circle of players has become stagnant. time to listen to some other views blizz.</div></div><hr />

Raiding is the pinnacle of what can be achieved in World of Warcraft. We feel that those encounters should be epic, with epic challenges and rewards to match.<br />
This type of thinking is very problematic.<br />
<br />
- you think epic means difficult and unforgiving mechanics<br />
- you want raiding to be &quot;epic&quot; and therefore pugs should not be able to progress<br />
- but you want everyone to progress<br />
<br />
The solution comes down to timing. We want to keep it epic for the high end raiders, but also ensure that content becomes more accessible over time.<br />
- your &quot;solution&quot; is, hardcore gamers should raid and everyone else should wait for months until they can try old raids to progress<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it make more sense to make everyone happy where normal mode would be for pugs and hard mode with better rewards for hardcore gamers?</div></div><hr />
