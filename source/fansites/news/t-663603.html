<br />
Additions from my leak<br />
Guild Achievements and Guild Leveling will be added to the game.<br />
Players will level by following the &quot;Path of the Titans&quot;<br />
Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep will be revamped and heroic versions will be added<br />
Rated Battlegrounds will be added to the game. <br />
Archeology will be a new profession<br />
<br />
Everything else below is confirmed ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is the next expansion for World of Warcraft. Dark and forgotten threats that have long stayed out of sight have finally arrived on our shores, unleashing a cataclysmic event upon Azeroth and now preparing more nefarius plans to take it back.<br />
<br />
Level Cap<br />
The level cap in the next expansion will be slightly lower than expected this time around; 85.<br />
<br />
This suggests Blizzard wants more room for expansions before hitting the level 100 cap. With less leveling to do (along with the revamped leveling listed below likely to increase the speed and ease of leveling), leveling a new race remains appealing for new and existing players alike.<br />
<br />
Leveling from 80-85 should be a much bigger deal, the idea is to make sure that gaining a level really means something and doesn't make you feel like you just have 4 more levels to go. <br />
<br />
New Classes<br />
Cataclysm doesn't introduce any new classes to the game. Instead, Blizzard have offered more race and classes combinations to players. The Some of these have alreadly been datamined from the 3.2.2 Test Realms. The An Injured Colleague (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/13986/an-injured-colleague/) quest and it's new Night Elf counter-part help to introduce the lore for these new race and class combinations, so we can probably expect to see more of these for some of the less traditional ones.<br />
<br />
Human Hunter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36575/human-hunter/)<br />
Orc Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36576/orc-mage/)<br />
Night Elf Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36579/night-elf-mage/)<br />

Gnome Priest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36589/gnome-priest/)<br />
Troll Druid (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36590/troll-druid/)<br />
<br />
<br />
New Races<br />
The events of the cataclysm has caused two new races to seek new allies. The Goblins for the Horde and the Worgen for the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Goblins<br />
Deathwing once again sought the services of the goblins, as slaves. Unable to refuse such an offer, the goblins were enslaved by him. A large group have resisted however. With their previous homes devastated by the cataclysm, they escaping to an island off the coast of The Barrens. As they strive to recover, they come across an Orc captured on an Alliance ship and rescue him. The Orc turns out to be none other than Thrall himself, and in return offers the Goblins a place within the Horde. These events are carried out in a quest line, allowing players to experience first-hand the reasons behind the Goblins' shift from neutrality.<br />
<br />
Worgen<br />
The cataclysm has cracked open the Greymane Wall, finally revealing what has happened to the kingdom of Gilneas and its citizens. With the Worgen curse taken hold, they have found a partial cure, allowing thme to retain their Human minds even when transformed. Venturing forth from Gilneas and seeking help from the Alliance, they have decided to join them, to combat the new threats of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Gilneas will make extensive use of the phasing system (much like the Death Knight starting area), to show what happened while the kingdom was cut off from the rest of the world and lead up to present day.<br />
<br />
Worgens will have two forms, a Worgen form and a Human form. Players will be able to customise the look of both forms.<br />
<br />
New Content<br />
Cataclysm will be the first expansion not to introduce a new continent, instead making use of previously unreleased zones and revamping existing ones.<br />
<br />
Classic Azeroth Revamp<br />
A cataclysmic event caused by Deathwing and Azshara will change the face of Azeroth as we know it. Most of the new content for Cataclysm will take the form of a revamped Azeroth, taking advantage of newer additions to WoW such as phasing and daily quests. Most of the quests and mobs in the classic zones will also be redesigned to make leveling less painful. With the revamp, a greater narritive and sense progression will be offered to players. Some zones and dungeons will change drastically to fit this, e.g.,<br />
<br />
The Barrens will be split into two separate zones of two different level bands.<br />
Azshara will become a low level (~10-20) zone.<br />
Some of the zones like the Thousand Needles will be flooded.<br />
Durotar is wrecked and apparently Orgrimmar could be destroyed. A new Orc city is rebuilt over the course of the expansion.<br />
Gnomeregan will be part of the expansion as well and gnomes might be able to reclaim their capital. (The last part is still unconfirmed)<br />
Wailing Caverns will be become a lush tropical area as a result of the druid's magic.<br />
The Blackrock Spire will erupt and a new version of Blackrock Mountains will be available, apparently Ragnaros will be back too.<br />
<br />
In the aftermath of the cataclysm, and the new conflicts on the horizon relief efforts can be found in many zones and new open PvP areas similar to Lake Wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
Flying in Azeroth<br />
Part of the redesign of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor is the introduction of flying to the two continents, allowing access to many new areas and quicker travelling across the large continents.<br />
<br />
Classic Dungeon Revamp<br />
Redesigning Onyxia's Lair in Patch 3.2.2 was just the first step. As most of the leveling will take place in revamped areas of Azeroth, so too will the dungeons, allowing players to use them to level from 80 to 85.<br />
<br />
Unreleased Zones &amp; Dungeons<br />
With the addition of flying mounts to Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms and the redesign of many zones, most of the previously unreachable or incomplete zones will now be made available to players. This is where most of the new content from 80 to 85 will take place. Some of these are,<br />
<br />
Hyjal (present)<br />
Gilneas - The Worgen starting Zone.<br />
Uldum<br />
<br />
It is unclear if the old Goblin locations such as Kezan and Undermine will be included in Cataclyms with the revelation of the goblins' plight, but several new islands have also been risen from the seas by the events of Cataclysm, some on the backs of giant sea turtles and whales, with the addition of several underwater zones.<br />
<br />
Characters and Events<br />
<br />
[b]Deathwing<br />
Deathwing the Destroyer / Neltharion the Earth-Warder (http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing) will play a major role in Cataclysm. Having been driven mad by Old God whisperings and turning against his own kind only to be fail in his attempts, Deathwing has sunk into the shadows. While the Horde and the Alliance were busy fighting back the Burning Legion only to then be beset with the Scourge, he has been lurking and moving things into place. After Lady Sinestra's failed attempts to create a Twilight Dragonflight (http://www.wowwiki.com/Twilight_dragonflight), he again retreated to Grim Batol and succeeded where she failed. With his results seen in the Obsidian Sanctum, he has finally created the supreme Dragonflight he sought and plans to unleash it upon the world. But what of the Old Gods' sway over him?<br />
<br />
Azshara<br />
Queen Azshara (http://www.wowwiki.com/Queen_Azshara) will also play a major part in Cataclysm. Unknown to many mortal races, long forgotten by others, and believe to be dead by her own kind, she has not been dormant in depths of the Maelstrom. Having those around her transformed by the Old Gods into Naga after her failure in the War of the Ancients, she has become far more powerful and a greater threat than she once was. Not content with just Nazjatar and the depths of the sea, Azshara seeks to reclaim power and reign once again. With the true plan behind Lady Vashj's support of Illidan remaining a mystery we do not know what hand Azshara has yet played. The big question remains, is she now serving her &quot;saviors&quot;, the Old Gods?<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm<br />
I'm still not sure who is the true end boss of Cataclysm is, but the cataclysm appears to have been caused by attempts to incantation to summon extremely powerful beings using an ancient incantation by Deathwing and Azshara. They're both very powerful, but the cataclysm itself suggests something more powerful is behind it, perhaps their shared past of Old God influence?<br />
<br />
The Guardian of Tirisfal<br />
Malfurion Stormrage will be returning to Azeroth to aid in the creation of the new Guardian of Tirisfal - Thrall! Med'an's (http://www.wowwiki.com/Med'an) role in these events is currently unknown.<br />
<br />
The New (New) Horde<br />
Thrall will hand over the leadership of the Horde to Garrosh Hellscream, while he serves as a coordinator for both the Horde and Alliance forces in and effort to combat the new threat of the Naga and Black Dragonflight. Without Thrall to keep Garrosh in check, he declares open war on the Alliance. In the political upheaval Cairne Bloodhoof is implicated as a traitor to the Horde and murdered by Garrosh. Cairne's son Baine takes over as the new Tauren chieftan. This could explain why Baine was removed from the game in Patch 3.2.2, you can find more information about this in Ahmo Thunderhorn - replacement for Baine Bloodhoof?

oh come on most if it was confirmed, Guardian-related stuff will probably be announced in the comic or when the expansion hits in a quest line or whatever<br />
<br />
as for me, I had some doubts at first but seeing this, in the future if Boub says he is 100% (or something close to that) sure then I KNOW its true ;)<br />

People had a knee-jerk reaction to an unconfirmed leak, and the part that remains unconfirmed (in fact most of what has been released leans toward it being untrue) is the only thing most people really cared about; the lore.<br />

Right, where is the confirmation of Thrall becoming the Guardian? Or the confirmation that Malfurion came back to join the council, when it is clear he came back to defend the World Tree.

What happened to the nay-sayers ? I don't see them around ...<br />
<br />
Can you spell PWNED for me? <br />
<br />
<br />
I wasn't one of the nay-sayers as I simply didn't care enough to post anything, figuring we'd see either way soon enough.<br />
<br />
However, laughing at the naysayers isn't sensible, considering it's reasonable to doubt. You see, logic mandates that the burden of proof rests on the affirmative case or the advocacy (the person making the claim). Since there was no evidence besides mention of an &quot;inside source&quot;, it was logical to assume that some (or most) of it was false. Courts operate under the same logical principle, hence the &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Criticizing people for being rational reflects exceptionally poorly on yourself... <br />
<br />
That being said, Boub was right on several things but some of it was wrong or hasn't been confirmed. For example, the Thrall giving Orgrimmar to Garrosh hasn't been confirmed - which is great because it was the item that seemed the least plausible. It would be out of character for Thrall to put Garrosh in charge, especially considering their disagreements and fights... it would be like (and I hate to use political examples) Obama giving the presidency to Sarah Palin - it wouldn't make much sense. He'd probably put Cairne or even Saurfang in charge, as both share his ideals and goals.<br />
<br />
That story could be confirmed, but until it is, it's perfectly reasonable (more so, in fact) to assume it's not true...</div></div><hr />

Except that the naysayers weren't doubting - they were were just as adamant they were right as the people who believed Boub - and with less or no evidence for their claims.<br />
(Naysayers operated under the principle that Boub was basically intentionally lying to them and the information was &quot;guilty&quot;, so the court analogy is not apt)</div></div><hr />

To blizzard: This is just fucked for me really. I've enjoyed the game for 3years now, but now you just go over the line. Tauren paladins etc. It's actually fucked up and I feel you just wanna change things so much that a new expansion is needed, cuz like all companies you in the end just wanna make money. But this is just getting to lame. I've never ever seen such a fucking shit expansion in WoW before, and actually not in any game. Is like making a expansion for Counter-Strike 1.6, and make it possible to use wallhack.<br />
<br />
You are just fucking up the game more and more, and what you don't understand is that if skilled players stops playing the game, EVERYONE WILL IN THE END.<br />
<br />
How would you feel if Tiger Woods stopped playing golf and he's your biggest star, you will stop playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
This expansion is just to fucking much about making more money and you've loosed the edge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fucking stick to the lore already and do stuff right, if you wanna make money like a real and good company, check out apple.com. Those guys actully keep stuff up and trying to make the company and their products better instead of just changing things to make money.<br />

Also, LOL at the money making comment. 4 years of WoW - $15/month for 12 million+ people, and not to mention the actual price of the game, and both expansions. I don't think you're in any position to tell Blizzard how to make money &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

Nobody quit in disgust when The Light became less of a euphemism for Christianity and more of a Force knock-off, or when Orcs were corrupted and sent into Azeroth rather than broke in there themselves because they got too bored of fighting each other, or when Garona stopped being half-human.<br />
People should stop having knee-jerk tantys about this kind of thing - Tauren paladins make a lot more sense than pan-dimensional spacecraft being hijacked by elvish addicts, but guess who brings those guys up these days? Nobody, because you get over it because at the end of the day a story was told and it's irrelevant to the primary work of grinding pixels for numbers.</div></div><hr />

Meh, I'm sure she'll be mentioned, but the underwater stuff could as easily be related to the Titans or Neptulon, this is after all the 'elemental war' expansion that's been anticipated for quite some time.<br />
<br />
No mention of Orgrimmar being destroyed.<br />
<br />
No mention of Thrall becoming the next guardian.<br />
<br />
No mention of Garrosh's assuming control of the horde.<br />
<br />
No mention of Cairne's death.<br />
<br />
I'm not discounting the information 'leaked' previously, but thus far the only things that have been confirmed could have been reasonably guessed through either data mining or Blizzard buying up all things Cataclysm. The really controversial stuff is still very much up in the air.</div></div><hr />

I find it hard to believe that Thrall would &quot;rebuild and reinforce&quot; Orgrimmar without it having been at least partially destroyed. I find it hard to believe that Orgrimmar would be &quot;rebuilt and reinforced&quot; specifically in the manner of Garrosh strongholds without some form of the leadership passing. If it does, what happens to Thrall other than he moves into the Council?</div></div><hr />

It's the best expansion by far in my opinion, all the vanilla players are roaring for blizzard for making this happen, yet the newer people to the game are angry, guess they don't understand that azeroth was only used for AH's, Gbanks and lower-levels.<br />

Funny how that works eh? People ask for new races like goblins, they get them, then complain. They want azeroth changing, they've already changed onyxia and they complain.<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually, I didn't use the correct words to describe what I felt.<br />
<br />
Let me put it into a few more words, for people like you who actually have/had some reason in doubting what Bouboille posted several days ago :) <br />
<br />
We had roughly 3 or 4 camps of people - the pessimists, who claimed that it made no sense and called &quot;bullshit&quot; which was a relatively small group. The trolls/nay-sayers to which my post was aimed at, which repeatedly and often in a really retarded way kept spamming the forums with their whining &amp; &quot;Bouboille does this simply for the clicks, he knows shit, he deceives people, he is the worst thing on the internet right now&quot; (the same group of people that did the same 2 weeks ago when the Patch was coming out). The neutral ones (which I believe I fall into) which still thought that it's mostly true, although with the way Blizzard changes its mind some of the &quot;leaked info&quot; would change by the release. And the fanboys, which were roughly the same sized group as the &quot;Nay-sayers&quot;. <br />
<br />
If you check some of my previous posts, you'll see that I'm calling for people to actually use their brain. Yes, pretty optimistic from me on such a forum, but I can keep trying at least. However, sometimes you just need a vent, and &quot;laughing at the disbelievers&quot; was just this for me. Unfortunately, the same people will still keep doing the same next time something like it happens - be it a patch, an expansion, or just a huge change. <br />
<br />
I hope it becomes much more clear this way :)</div></div><hr />

It would make people much more happy and they would lvl in northrend faster so they would play more because if they think like me they love there flying mount. It is faster than enyother mount other than your epic riding and i do not like tha the epic riding is so much money to i like how the mount is cheap but i do hate that the training coast so much. And you made dks week now eny paladin can beat a dk if there the same lvl i have had a lvl 60 beat my dk when i was lvl 65. And i do not like that mages can port people with needing a item and warlocks need a bunch of people to summon people that just sounds to unfare for warlocks i think they both need nothing like the warlocks summon people by thereselfs and the mages open ports with using nothing it would make it far. And that is it so if blizzard reads this and if they change it there would be alot more happy people on wow like me. So i ask you to do this for the people who pay for world of warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was caused by horde players, who's QQ about not getting truly badass was so big, that it created whole oceans! And flooded 1000 needles in the process....<br />

<br />
To blizzard: This is just fucked for me really. I've enjoyed the game for 3years now, but now you just go over the line. Tauren paladins etc. It's actually fucked up and I feel you just wanna change things so much that a new expansion is needed, cuz like all companies you in the end just wanna make money. But this is just getting to lame. I've never ever seen such a fucking shit expansion in WoW before, and actually not in any game. Is like making a expansion for Counter-Strike 1.6, and make it possible to use wallhack.<br />
<br />
You are just fucking up the game more and more, and what you don't understand is that if skilled players stops playing the game, EVERYONE WILL IN THE END.<br />
<br />
How would you feel if Tiger Woods stopped playing golf and he's your biggest star, you will stop playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
This expansion is just to fucking much about making more money and you've loosed the edge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fucking stick to the lore already and do stuff right, if you wanna make money like a real and good company, check out apple.com. Those guys actully keep stuff up and trying to make the company and their products better instead of just changing things to make money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sry mmo-champion for all bad words, those are ment for blizzard and I just needed to say this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
im not going to say much but Apple is doing just that and go look at my last post when someone QQed about blizz and money...</div></div><hr />
