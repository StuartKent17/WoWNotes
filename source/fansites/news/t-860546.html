World of Warcraft PTR Patch 4.1 - Updated February 28th<br />
<br />
x - Notes added in the 2nd notes update of the day. <br />
<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Flying mounts can now be used in Ghostlands.<br />
x Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40 resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to 10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as their resilience climbs.<br />

PvP<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
The Focused Assault and Brutal Assault buffs have changed.<br />
<br />
After 3 minutes of both teams having the flag, both flag carriers will get Focused Assault, which increases damage taken by 10%.<br />
Every minute afterward, an additional stack will be applied to increase damage taken by an additional 10%.<br />
After 7 minutes, Brutal Assault will be applied in place of Focused Assault. In additional to the damage debuff, this debuff also caps the player's movement speed at 100%. The damage taken debuff works the same and will add 10% to the debuff up to a maximum of 100% damage taken.<br />
<br />
The Battle for Gilneas<br />
<br />
Graveyard Changes<br />
<br />
Players who die at a control point that they own will now be teleported to the next closest graveyard, instead of the one at which they died.<br />
If a player's team owns the Mine and Waterworks, and dies at Waterworks, they will be teleported to the Mine.<br />
If an Alliance player's team only owns Lighthouse, and dies at Lighthouse, they will respawn at their base.<br />
If a Horde player's team owns Waterworks and Mine, and dies at Lighthouse, they will respawn at Waterworks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />

<br />
That's funny because SimulationCraft, Raidbots, StateofDPS, and my personal experiences all say Balance is doing great, and a small nerf to Starsurge isn't going to magically make them suck.<br />
<br />
They'll still be at least middle of the pack or higher.<br />
<br />
I mean do you really think a 20% nerf to an ability that makes up around 10-15% of your overall damage (according to the logs I'm looking at) is going to kill your spec?<br />
<br />
That's like a 2-3% nerf overall, to a spec which is consistently at or near the top of meters in nearly every raid composition.</div></div><hr />

You have to be joking, or maybe you're talking about PvP. I'll admit to having no PvP experience.<br />

I'm sort of glad the druid nerf came along. My friend who is much less geared then I and hardly knows his class pumps out 20k+ on fights. The lazerchicken needed the nerf bat.<br />

This change is pretty nice, although it might hold some kinda of scaling problem for Destro locks since Doomguard doesn't scale with their mastery.<br />

You're forgetting its cooldown went up from 10 to 25 seconds (doesn't show on the mouse-over tooltip since it's based on Live), so using the glyph simply means it goes from 25 to 20, though it gives a relatively higher benefit now, since before: 1 second out of 10 = 10% and after: 5 seconds out of 25 = 20%.</div></div><hr />

Colossus Smash has been nerfed to 70%, down from 100%, to lower the Warrior's burst. The buffs to Raging Blow, Mortal Strike, Overpower and Flurry are meant to revert the DPS loss in PvE, or Warriors would fall behind other classes.</div></div><hr />

And finally this brilliant explination to changing the warrior .....(might as well make a DK and get it over with)<br />
<br />
Warrior (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
Juggernaut Nerf<br />
2. Why the Nerf seems so harsh.<br />
Warriors had gotten used to having extremely high mobility. Arms warriors were so mobile that kiting wasn't very effective against them, and their uptime was very high as a result. In fact, we'd arrived at a place where melee in general just had too much up-time on casters, especially healers. Conditions were prompting a move toward more instant cast spells and casting on the move, when we wanted to take PvP back to a place where cast time spells could still have a place on the battlefield. We feel this approach introduces more choices in PvP both for the casters and melee in terms of what abilities to use, when to close the gap, when to make space, what to interrupt, etc. Rather than give casters yet more tools to generate breathing space and perpetuate that arms race, it made sense to take a second look at melee mobility instead.<br />
<br />
We understand that you need to be on your target to do your jobs, but it didn’t really make sense to allow close to 100% up time either. On the other hand, we understand that without high up-time warriors might not bring as much to an Arena or Rated Battleground team, and we're adding new utility in a future patch to help address that, though we’re not yet ready to share details.<br />
<br />
Going back to the point though, we didn't want to funnel warriors into speccing into Fury, and that was never the intention. While it would be nice if both specs were equally viable for PvP and PvE, we realize that's a tough goal to meet. On the other hand, if Fury is the best spec for both PvP and PvE and Arms is left with nothing, then that's not a great place to be either.<br />
<br />
As for some general notes, we do think Arms damage is a little low in both PvP and PvE, and we might adjust that soon. This isn't a solution to current PvP viability issues, and we understand that. I'm just mentioning it because we're on the subject of Arms and it's worth noting. While we’re on the subject of stuff ‘worth noting’, we also don’t like jumping to avoid Charge, so we're examining some potential solutions for that too.<br />
<br />
We're not looking at changing the talent trees at the moment, since we’re very happy with both the Arms and Fury trees as well as the results of some of our core mechanics changes, such as normalizing rage, redesigning Heroic Strike and changing stance penalties.<br />
<br />
1. The Usefulness of Heroic Leap.<br />
Heroic Leap involves a lot of movement code, which is among the most challenging things we can do in our engine. We wouldn't have included it if we believed that it was useless, or wasn't usually effective. We think it's a cool ability that does offer greater mobility on the battlefield, even if it isn't as useful specifically for closing with a target as intercept or charge are.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help us, or you, to just say that it's useless or almost never works on the forums. Heroic Leap functionality is something we're actively working to improve, so if you find yourself consistently unable to find a path to the jump target, when you submit a report let us know when it didn't work, where you were, and what you were trying to do. The more specific and detailed you are, the more tools you give us to make your tools work better. (Source)<br />
<br />
State of Warrior Talent Trees<br />
We're happy with the talent trees themselves in terms of their current structure and content. That's not the same as saying we're completely happy with the current state of warriors in general. &quot;Broken&quot; is also an exaggeration that I prefer to avoid, because it occludes more than it reveals.

You're either A) terrible. Or B) Trolling, or a bit of both. Pick one.<br />

This isn't just a nerf for prot warriors anyways, if they wanted to reduce up time of spell reflectionfor prot warriors they should have simply removed the portion of the talent that lowers it's cd. Which honestly, wasn't that useful anyways.<br />
<br />
Also baddie, spell reflect has one charge and lasts for 5 seconds, you see a warrior cast (if you don't as a caster you are in fact bad) it try not using an ability like unstable affliction or death coil. Noob. Use aoe abilities. They cannot be spell reflected.</div></div><hr />

Since you do not want your LB stack to fall of, especially with the 4p t11 bonus, you refresh it either with nourish/rg/ht or when you are in a hurry with lb itself. The Bloom nerf doesn't really do much for the same reason. <br />
I have problems letting LB bloom if the tank is taking heavy damage so yeah not a real nerf for people that actually know what they are doing and are not reapplying 3 stacks of lifebloom (3 gcd) for a heal that is slightly bigger than a ht.<br />
The Tranq buff is a welcome change but i hope this is not what they meant when they said they wanted to give us more raid utility ( wtb targetable barkskin).</div></div><hr />

How about no. How about i complain here and on the official boards about a completely unwarranted change. There is no reason for it.<br />

Agreed. I don't understand why people seem to think that blizzards choices are infallible and we shouldn't ever argue with them. Thats the only reason for changes in the game are that we argue for what we want. Especially as of right now its a public test realm, not live. Things change daily on PTRs due to PLAYER input as well as inside testers. Why shouldn't we have our opinions heard?</div></div><hr />

We lose a daze, a silence and 6 seconds of school lockout. That's not the kind of change you just &quot;deal with&quot; when you aren't being compensated in any way AND Spell Reflect got nerfed by a ridiculous amount. Prot PVP just got reamed.</div></div><hr />

Its a 4% mana nerf to a spell that gives you back mana you'll probably not even notice, if the bloom is what your talking about L2P you shouldn't be letting it bloom anyway.<br />
<br />
I'll take a Tranq CD reduction over 7% Base mana LB any day<br />
<br />
4% mana or 2X 400k-500k heals to the whole party? Pretty sure anyone would take the Tranq CD reduction, you will probably save the lost mana with a second Tranquility or at least close to it anyway.<br />
<br />
Long story short LB isn't going any where its still our main spell, not to mention the 4 piece tier 11 bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
To be honest, the devs must have gotten their lunch money taken by druids on several occasions. God forbid a class that can actually beat a Frost Mage.<br />
<br />
Not only is cyclone getting toned down, but Starsurge is getting a massive nerf. Starsurge is the only ability we had left that did any real damage and was instant cast. And it was total RNG, 4% proc rate. As a general rule, Boomkins are not viable in arenas because everything they do requires a lengthy cast time. This nerf, couple with the loss of instant roots, is an ongoing slap in the face to druids. Did anyone see masses of boomkins running around in arenas or rated battlegrounds? No, we had to fight for our spots tooth and nail meanwhile teams are taking tons of paladins, death knights, and mages. Sitting there casting Starfire or Wrath or expecting Insect Swarm and Moonfire do meaningful damage is a joke.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile I see no significant frost mage nerfs, and Death Knights continue to get buffed. Warlocks are also seeing significant buffs, stupid Noobguard already did too much damage as it was.<br />
<br />
And just when I'm thinking I might be able to switch to warrior, in come more crazy changes.<br />
<br />
Once again the devs prove that they are completely out of touch with pvp. They've allowed instant cast heals from holy paladins and MELEE CLASSES to dominate the landscape. Honestly, Blizz needs to take a look at their leadership because some of this stuff is ridiculous. Don't even get me started on the changes to Warsong Gulch and Gilneas.<br />
<br />
P.S. And oh no! Blizz found out that people were farming Karazhan for gold. God forbid that people should make gold in game by doing something other than questing. How are PvP'ers supposed to get money? <br />
<br />
Looks like Rift here I come. =/ <br />

<br />
Lifebloom gives you back mana, Resto Druids have a talent that is linked to keeping Lifebloom up 100% and gives you back mana<br />
<br />
Revitalize<br />
When you periodically heal with your Rejuvenation or Lifebloom spells, you have a 20% chance to instantly regenerate 1%/2% of your total mana. This effect cannot occur more than once every 12 sec.<br />
<br />
In addition, you also grant Replenishment when you cast or refresh Lifebloom.<br />
<br />
Replenishment - Grants up to 10 party or raid members mana regeneration equal to 1% of their maximum mana per 10 sec. Lasts for 15 sec. <br />
<br />
Replenishment also works on the Druid, not just the rest of the party.<br />
<br />
When you keep LB up, Replenishment never drops off.<br />
<br />
This is also why Int is are best stat, and why you'll see resto druids with crazy high mana pools.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there are nerfs to some. Yes, there are buffs to some. It's an MMO. Things change in MMOs. Deal with it. Can't deal with it? Quit, or adapt.<br />
<br />
And even though I'm not actively playing anymore, I do like some of the new DK changes. Not that they necessarily needed much changing (DK main), but still pretty nice. The level of &quot;fail&quot; on some people here, in regards to the revamped &quot;Raise ally&quot;, is astonishing. It says in clear text that the ability is being changed to function &quot;like Rebirth&quot;. Does Rebirth turn you into a ghoul? No. So why would Raise Ally do that? The ghoul thing was nice the first few times, but in general a pointless feature to the spell. Better to bring back the player as his own character, and not a ghoul, and get some use out of the player instead.</div></div><hr />

imo the need to introduce a second set of talent trees.. pvp versions of trees.. because right now there is way to much qq because a class who is to OP in pvp gets nerfed and it affects their pve performance when it may not have been great. players would still be only allowed to select their 2 trees but it would also open up the oppurtunity to add more unique raid utility to different classes</div></div><hr />

I think you get the wrong idea, elemental and feral do less dps than balance even after nerf. Starsurge do around 11% of total dps in most circumstances, 20% nerf of 11% dps is 0.088 actual loss. If you plug the dataz from logging sites like stateofdps, the number should still be above the 2 by around 0.02%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Balance blows dog in PvP, and they nerf starsurge wich was our only instant nuke (4% proc chance) when it already needs to crit to be anything but a wet noodle and they nerf our CC so we have a 1.7sec cast 5 sec CC where the target is damage immune... And we have already gotten a 5% nerf to all our damage. Get the point now? I´ll give you a hint.. Moonkin != viable for PvP, AT ALL<br />
<br />
Now at the same time Locks and wars are being buffed. Have you seen Fury burst in arena?? Locks have a bazzillion more tools than Moonkins and lolguard was already dishing out a bunch of damage to Moonkins who have basically 0 utility for peeling a melee. Typhoon is bugged, no instant CC etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is Moonkin is doing ok in PvE and then Blizz decides to look at how to nerf that, and of all the many many useful and fun spells *bleah* moonkins have access to, they decide to nerf one of the most important damage spells in PvP, where, mind you, Moonkin is absolutely HORRIBLE. Furthermore they decide to nerf mana for resto (I guess that's the point?) So they decide to increase mana and reduce healing on lifebloom. Which is - though a sucky one - one of our few methods of survivability/healing (rolling 3 stacks, switch back to moonkin, wait for the final healing bloom effect). It might be the nerfs are ok in terms of PvE but it just destroys Moonkin PvP even more than it already is. Meanwhile warriors get a change to their interrupt to put it on a shorter cooldown. Yup makes perfect sense. I remember all those tons of warriors I destroyed the last few months.... Oh wait. That's right - they destroyed me with their stuns, interrupts and selfhealing which is better than mine.</div></div><hr />

They are fine in 25m because they have all the buffs and stuff and even then it depends I guess on the fight itself. Go look at 10m which allot of guilds are also doing and you will see a dif story. Only reason moonkins shine in 25ms really is because some encounters have more adds 2 kill where multidoting while in an eclipse states does a significant amount of dmg.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the odds of some blues reading posts on these forums are higher than them redaing posts on their own forums in my opinion. Why? Because it's usually a whine fest on the official forums and I'd like to think that the people here on mmo are better at the game as well and have more informative posts. For a company the size of Blizzard it would be really strange not to have some empoyees covering the major fan sites.</div></div><hr />

I know that not everyone PvPs but please, before you address someone as crazy, analyze the possible PvP ramifications in addition to the PvE ones.

Shield bash was superior to pummel while going defensive. It locked out 2 seconds longer and dazed the target but required a shield of course. Now it wont silence anymore for prots. <br />
And then there is the spell reflect nerf..i don't even...the odds atm of reflecting the right spell (instead of some dot/pet cast/etc ) is like 10% (well, more of course in 2v2, less enemies) and now they double the cooldown considering you even glyph for the damned thing. And let's not forget the fact the amount of times u get one spell casted at you, you reflect, and you get sheeped/cloned/... with your reflect buff still up. <br />
<br />
Oh well, maybe they come up with a solution to the endless kiting, ccing, shit defensive cooldowns and more changes coming on the ptr.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Savage Defense might make bears take more damage on AE pulls in 5-player dungeons than other tanks, but we don’t think AE threat generation is a problem (again when in reference to max level).<br />
<br />
And now they do this:<br />
<br />
Swipe (Bear) cooldown has been reduced to 3 seconds, down from 6.<br />
<br />
They really don't have a clue what's going on in their game, do they?<br />
<br />
If you read the entire thread that both quotes came out of you would realize they said threat generation isn't a problem at max level. The change in swipe was to address the issue with leveling up to 81 without thrash. This change seems to be a bit late though but is definately welcomed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if this will convince Demo/Afflic warlocks to stop using succubus, because this change only seems to bring these 2 pets closer to the succi's level and not above it like they should.<br />
What would really fix this is if they just gave lash of pain a 4 sec CD or so.<br />
I hope u are joking , Felguards needs some single target buffs and thats all , puting lash of pain on 4 sec CD would pretty much remove Succubus from both PvP and PvE because THATS HER BASIC and only ATTACK<br />
<br />
mana feed with felguard was crazy as ever with Legion Strike critting on multiple mobs with this change demo should barely need to use Life Tap<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;•Doomguard's damage has been increased by 50%. The Doomguard is intended to be the best guardian for single-target damage, and the Infernal the best when there are multiple targets.&quot;<br />
<br />
This change is pretty nice, although it might hold some kinda of scaling problem for Destro locks since Doomguard doesn't scale with their mastery.<br />
<br />
&quot;•Haunt damage has been increased by 30%.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wonder why they keep giving haunt these cookie crumb buffs...<br />
I understand buff to Haunt and Doomguard but what about Destruction , it seems Blizzard thinks warlocks need only 1 viable spec for PvP ...<br />
<br />
<br />
A buff to a nerf is still a nerf. 10%, 20%, it really doesn't matter.<br />
Spell Reflect on a 6 sec CD was stupid as hell (i play warrior too) , as prot u could pretty much lock down every caster not allowing him to effectively cast any spell on u<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow... Prot warriors are getting the shaft right about now... Was Spell Reflect really that OP? T_T<br />
Spell Reflect on a 6 sec cd was OP , if u played any caster vs prot warrior u would see how frustrating it was <br />
<br />
I know that not everyone PvPs but please, before you address someone as crazy, analyze the possible PvP ramifications in addition to the PvE ones. We lose a 6 second daze and our second silence(the other being Heroic Throw). Add on to that the lengthy cooldown they're putting on Shield Reflect and PvProt is pretty screwed(the others are more well off simply because they actually have damage).<br />
Prot PvP will not be screwed , casters will have more chances of surviving instead of sitting in silence/stun 24/7 , i play a warrior and i know how its easy to lock down caster as prot warrior</div></div><hr />

Starsurge do around 11% of total dps in most circumstances, 20% nerf of 11% dps is 0.088 actual loss.

It's not for PvE...It's for PvP that many of us are worried, WE DON'T HAVE A BURST...We can't cast starfire because 2.5 is too slow, wrath is slow too, with moonfire spam you can't kill anyone that has 3k+ resi....Instant starsurge was the only rng burst we had.<br />

Gotta love teh resto druid nerfs. lifebloom is sick atm; druids are keeping whole team up in 3s even when oom and cyclone without cd makes no sense compared to physic scream, hex or hammer of justice. <br />
<br />
Druids are best healers in arena atm and then u get nerf, just like resto shamans got themself nerfed from best healer to worst in last patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have no idea what you are talking about, you really don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How about you read it whole to get idea what are they doing, hm ?<br />
Obviously they are removing shield bash and putting pummel in its place - its all in there.<br />
Tbh good change as now silences are only two for prot (was incredible with that amount of control vs casters)<br />
Also notice spell reflect nerfs and such, hinting pvp was not consolided for prots.<br />
Frees them one spell, gets prot back in line. Sounds like good change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shield bash being removed really isnt that bad, as pummel now does the same thing and can now be used in all stances :D<br />
<br />
Shield bash: Dazes target, 6 second lock out, full silence with gag order<br />
Pummel: No daze, not effected by gag order, 4 sec lock out<br />
<br />
It really isn't the same unless they make changes to talents in the next PTR build.</div></div><hr />

Hey we have our passive spell, but it also got hit with nerf bat :)<br />

They have to redesign our mastery or make it passive. 30% bonus dmg ( from 100% of mastery bonus ) while not in eclipse and during eclispe is the same. or make it like mages mastery, bonus to nature spell dmg entire time. Reduce % gain by 50% and point gain per mastery by 50%. Make it passive.....</div></div><hr />

Not even remotely the same. Wind Shear only affects cast-time spells and does zero damage, Spell Reflection works on any single-target spell, instant or not, and can do potentially devastating damage, or incapacitate the caster in some other way. See that the Mage just got Hot Streak!? Time it right and that trinketed Pyro goes right back in their face. Wind Shear wouldn't touch that.<br />

I totally agree, thank you for pointing it out yet again, maybe people will actually read what the dam spells do and for how long before commenting on what they DO NOT KNOW.</div></div><hr />

HB buff is a buff to single and multi-target (20% more front end is still more damage after the 50% reduction to other targets), and on top of the Frost Strike buff, should make mastery even more useful than before.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, DK Battle Res? Sweet. Means I'll use Raise Ally more than the 3 times I've used it since Wrath launched.</div></div><hr />

5 sec talented but when fighting vs shamans u dont sit in silence/stun 24/7 as caster , prot warrior can kill every caster and end up fight with 90% hp (except frost mages :P )</div></div><hr />

This change is total epic failure on blizzards part. <br />
<br />
In a half clear of Karazan, clearing ALL optional mobs (up stairs of attunmen), and killing attunemen, moroes, maiden, and opera (again all mobs possible) solo i came out with about 600g, 15 stacks of netherweave, and like maybe 20 greens, i can see it could be seen as a good gold spot, but its once a week, and if you take 1 person with you, the gold is signicantly less, its only if you solo that half of kara, idk what i got for other half, and chess is to hard for me to solo, i am not skilled at that event so i usually take a few others with me, so i have only done a few solo clears up to chess.<br />
<br />
As for mags, he gave me about 200g for 3 people clear, and Gruul was about 150g, and idk about doom and kazz....so really this nerf is uneeded imo, it gave me something to do once a week to get a little gold and play one of my fave instances, 1000g in a 2-3 hour clear solo once a week is not op, i dont play the AH i dont farm hardcore, i get by on my measly amount of gold, blizzard has already nerfed almost every way to make decent gold, and to farm cloth (look at frostweave, its terrible) instead of nerfing spots to farm and gold they should increase it, but i guess they make all the decisions, however stupid in my own opinion or not. Lame either way.</div></div><hr />

What I'm really confused about is why on earth is shield bash being removed?<br />
<br />
*pummel is now useable in all stances.<br />
That's why.<br />
<br />
That's actually a buff to buff fury and arms in pvp, seing as if they now go defensive stance just to intervene or disarm, thus not equipping a shield, they can faster interrupt a cast if needed while being in defensive with no shield equipped:)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prag</div><div class="date">2011-03-01, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can completely understand the gold change on Magtheridon but why Kazzak and Karazhan? On my server I get to see Kazzak maybe once a month and Karazhan takes a bit of time to get through the place, why the hell are they taking out the fun ways of getting gold...am I supposed to play the auction house? Am I supposed to squeeze every copper out of everything while holding down and beating the new players so they immediately know that nobody is ever supposed to have fun when gold is involved?<br />
<br />
WoW is a game of options, several ways of getting experience, several ways of obtaining items, several ways of getting gold...and now they're going to mess with the only fun way. *very annoyed*<br />
<br />
<br />
I 100% agree with this.<br />
<br />
Buying low and selling high is somehow more acceptable than going back to instances that are just gathering dust.<br />
<br />
If I were a game designer, I'd want people to want to still see the work that took hundreds of hours, even if it's just for a tiny chunk of gold. <br />
<br />
They can nerf whatever class abilities they want in the name of balance, but nerfing fun for the sake of nerfing it is ridiculous. Did they really expect people to get by on 25 Dailies x 16g per day? iLvl 346 Blues go for 4k+ on US-Illidan (listed as Full). iLvl359 epics go for upwards of 48k (Fury of Angerforge trinket as an example) or 60k (BOE Caster cloak). <br />
<br />
They're basically saying: Play the AH, buy your gold or forever be poor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm certainly not going to quit over any realistic change they make, but in defense of the people you're mocking, I can count on one hand the number of major PTR changes have been reverted since Wrath. <br />
<br />
So, yeah it's probably easy for you to say &quot;Get over it, it's a PTR and it might not go live&quot;, but in reality, the chances of them NOT going live are slim. I can also see how people get tired of seeing the rapid ups-and-downs of their class. It just pushes FOTM rerolls when your Class is constantly going from top of the chart potential to barely worth a raid slot.</div></div><hr />

God forbid a class that can actually beat a Frost Mage.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />
<br />
Several classes can beat frost mages. Spriests, dks, sub rogues, Warlocks, anyone with a dispeller on them since mages have no dispel protection. Stop complaining about them.<br />
<br />
Powerword:Barrier nerf....really? They need to redesign the spell. It is a small area that you need to have people stack under for it to be effective. It is so situational, the nerf is not needed. Lets nerf the absorbs and damage mitigation of a spec that relies on them to be effective.</div></div><hr />
