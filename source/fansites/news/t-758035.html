I'm pretty stoked with Mage set at the moment, due to 2p and 4p both being straight DPS increases.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it's due to being first Tier sets. They need to further test out how each class works in the new raid environment before they implement more versatile (fun?) bonuses<br />
<br />
Also, ARCHEOLOGY. Cannot wait to waste hours and hours on a relatively useless profession. And I mean that in all seriousness, I love this kind of stuff :)<br />

I agree. Some of the set bonuses aren't all that bad, but the rest just don't seem to compare with the t10 version. I know, I know... have to upgrade your gear at some point, but for myself I would prefer to enjoy those upgrades. And yes, I also know this is beta -- it's why I'm hoping Blizzard hasn't firmly decided those bonuses yet.<br />
<br />
Waiting to see more shaman info at the moment, so... anyone have a clue as to where the &quot;Ishmael&quot; title originates from? It sounds like it may have something to do with Uldum.<br />

Fel Flame damage is crap, since it's instant and have a low SP coefficient. And anyway look at the 2% proc chance...<br />
Both bonuses are among the worse I've seen in the last years, I'd have much preferred a boring +5% crit chance on dots, nukes or pets.<br />

<br />
talentless, holy power * 3 generation: takes 14 seconds (4.5 * 3)<br />
Inquisition: 20% damage boost for 12 seconds. Impossible to keep up without talents.<br />
Word of Glory: 12% damage boost for 10 seconds. Also impossible to keep up with talents.<br />
Templar's Verdict: if we want to keep our damage buffs up we'll never end up hitting this<br />
<br />
With talents and EXTREME (33%) haste - BiS gear<br />
Crusader strike every 3 seconds, every other move has ~1/3 chance of generating holy power. so, full holy power generation: 5 seconds<br />
Hit word of glory every other holy power wipe, alternating Inquisition every other holy power wipe. Still no room for templar's verdict.<br />

<br />
I remember having once read that they prefer reactive healing to predictive healing. A shield that lasts 30 seconds has a huge margin for error...HUGE. It's almost impossible to fuck it up. At least with lifebloom, you're punished for a bad usage after 7/8 seconds. With a shield, you haven't wasted that mana until 30 seconds runs its course.<br />
<br />
Make it last 8 seconds with a 12 second weakened soul effect along with its current steep mana cost, and see how much less people use it.</div></div><hr />

Killing streak - Like the name, but I will have to see how this talent pans out<br />
Cobra Shot going to SV..I have to say I did sort of see this coming.<br />
<br />
And DK Ghouls got some new abilities, as did Warlock pets ( In last build Felguard etc ) Where are the new hunter pet abilites? Soon no doubt.<br />
However what intrigues me the most is this : <br />
•Traps had their description modified, apparently the restriction of &quot;Only one trap can be active at a time.&quot; no longer exists<br />
<br />
If I am reading this right, this would mean a hunter could lay down. A Ice trap,A snake trap, Explosive trap,Immolation trap and a freezing trap all at once ( since traps cost no focus...although trap launcher does ) So does this mean a hunter can say fire off 2 traps, and then drop another 3.. If they can then that is an awesome change for PVP, and PVE in some aspects.<br />
<br />
Now the Spriest changes:<br />
Range of spells increased - Expected<br />
Twisted Faith - how it should be. Do not like any talent that is a + hit one.<br />
Mind Flay. Nice buff to damage i guess.<br />
<br />
And Inner Sanctum is real nice. Shame a Spriest can only spend 2 points in it, as most will take Evang and Archangel. And for the love of god...why has blizzard not switched around improved physic scream and silence..makes more sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
* Oh and Azerothian Navigation - I am hoping this is a passive we get when we log in, and not something we have to pay for, as Blizzard promised us the ability to fly in Azeroth right away. I am sure it is..fairly sure lol. Either way, whatever happens happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ILjXYZ</div><div class="date">2010-09-10, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the rogue 4-piece T11 bonus: <br />
<br />
A 1% chance of a proc that grants 1 guaranteed critical envenom or eviscerate doesn't really seem like much at first glance but I was surprised by what I found after running some quick napkin math. Based on a WoL report containing my rogue's contribution to a recent guild 25-man heroic Saurfang kill I came up with an overall dps gain of 1.6% (50934 damage) from the t11 bonus. Of course, this number comes about from some very basic math and assumes that the stats on the gear I was wearing then are the same as the T11 stats (which they obviously will not be) and does not take into account the loss of the T10 2-piece bonus that I was wearing (I did not have the 4-piece bonus).<br />
<br />
From what I've seen, Blizzard typically designs tier pieces to have slightly fewer raw stats than offset pieces but then makes up for the difference in stats with the tier bonuses. I'm sure our Eviscerate damage in Cataclysm will be a bit different than it is now, but I wonder if a 1 - 2% dps gain will be enough to overshadow whatever offset pieces will be available.<br />
<br />
Still, it is nice to see that the T11 bonuses might actually provide a dps gain that will be worth weighing against offset pieces unlike the 2-piece T9 bonus which is absolutely worthless or, dare I say, the 2-piece T10 bonus which is absolutely mandatory. Maybe this is a small taste of Blizzard's intention to let the player have a bit of lateral choice in gear selection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what? I think it could just be there when we log in for several reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard promised us that we would be able to fly in Azeroth as soon as Cata was released<br />
2. Many of the zones in Beta ( Deepholme, Mount Hyjal ) require you to get to high places to complete quests ( Kill a bird in a nest on top a mountain for example ) so I really cannot see Blizzard saying &quot;You have to have X amount of gold to be able to quest in the new areas..if you do not then fuck you&quot;<br />
<br />
So I pretty much think it will be there when we log in, or we will have to learn it as a skill. So I wouldn't worry.</div></div><hr />

The set bonuses suck, especially since healers have the same ones. It's LAME, but it's beta, so I imagine it'll change before I get my grubby little paws on them. I will say that I'm not getting rid of my T10 2pc Resto bonus until they pry it out of my cold, dead fingers. :\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofc there has to be a skill that allows you to fly in EK and Kali. Otherwise you could level to 60 and then start flying in the level 80+ zones and gain easy levels due to the massive discover exps, not to mention flying above your friend that is killing level 85 mobs for massive shared exp. I'm quite sure you'll learn the skill at level 80 or 78.<br />
<br />
Not sure how flying passenger mounts will work though, they would still allow nabs to enter level 85 zones. But then again, I'm not in beta this time either so don't know if a flying mount is even required to enter those zones.</div></div><hr />

And for ppl QQing and worrying about paying for Azeroth flying. Look its simple:<br />
<br />
You will learn it as a skill ( Level 80 required )<br />
You will not have to pay to get it, and if you do it will be a small amount.<br />
<br />
You CANNOT quest in Hyjal, Deepholme etc without being able to fly..it is impossible, believe me. It is only there to restrict anyone below level 80 flying in the new zones. It was recently changed to level 80 only entering the new zones, no 78-81 stuff.<br />
<br />

Don't want to cause drama or anything, but how is [We had it all along *cough*] luck-based? You can easily get it in a premade. I got it on the second attempt, and have done it several other times to help friends get it. Get two bases and keep them until the end of the game, let the opposing team keep two, defend and only capture the last one at the very end of the game. Now I don't know how the Battle for Gilneas works, but there is no luck involved in the Arathi Basin achievement.</div></div><hr />

I don't. We already have the most abilities of any melee DPS class in our rotation, why would we want another.. since we'll already be watching additional buffs over and above what we do now (searing flames for one).<br />
<br />
Adding Lava Burst back to Maelstrom (as it was in WotLK beta) was a mistake, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

Azerothian flying looks more like the whole Coldweather flying from WotLK, that let you fly in Northrend guess it will be around the same price to (maybe litle inflated because gold is easy to come by nowdays).<br />

The 310% flying skill will be more expensive.<br />

&quot;We’ve added a new flying skill called Flight Master's License. When World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is released, players who purchase the expansion will see this skill available from flight trainers for 250 gold once they reach level 60.

Hunters had a 15% self-heal on Chimera before this patch - you needed to apply widow to target to get that heal. Think 10% nerf was too much. Oh well, some minor heals on one spec is better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

Atleast it involves doing PvP, or doing anything at all.<br />

Beats 'cheating' the game to get those titles, atleast the high-end ones. (Botting, Account Sharing, leeching). <br />
And Farming normal BGs every day to get the mid-ones.<br />

<br />
I'm loving the Scepter of Az'Aqir since I've always liked the bug mounts but never had the opportunity to ride one outside of AQ. I will be disappointed, however, if it's exactly the same as the blue one. I myself would prefer a darker blue and some updated textures for it.<br />
<br />
About the Holy Paladin T11 4 piece, can anyone on beta tell me how much we're using Holy Radiance and if how good 1620 Spirit would be for us?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i assume this means the scorpion isnt gonna be a reskin either<br />
<br />
Probably not but this lion, while it does use a new model technically, still uses the classic cat base. It just has better textures, armor, and a new mane added on.<br />
<br />
Something similar will happen with the Scorpion I bet.</div></div><hr />

Hand of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76672/hand-of-light/)<br />
Your autoattacks have a 8% chance to grant Hand of Light, causing your next Holy Power ability to consume no Holy Power and to cast as if 3 Holy Power were consumed. Each point of Mastery increases the chance by an additional 1%.<br />

(grinding daily for weeks work). Let it stay dead, or just get rid of emblems and bring back THE OLD PVP HONOUR SYSTEM (complete with the old old AV). That'd be more fun.. just have the emblems for &quot;arena junkies&quot;. With decaying honour per day, as well as Dishonourable Kills... really make raiding cities more fun :P<br />
<br />
I've already ripped apart ghostcrawler for his idotic notion that you can't have PUG rated BGs (but lets face it in patch 2.1 blizzard still clings to the fact that &quot;matchmaking&quot; system based on gear WORKS haha, seriously check it out.. patch 2.1).<br />
<br />
Rated BGs in groups, more elitist crap... like there isn't enough of that already. The whole arena thing i don't even see as PvP, it's just arena crap. Seriously you can play that for free on guild wars with a spectator mode, it's amateur hour. Hardly &quot;war&quot;. All it ever does is highlight the class differences to which blizzards unoriginal excuse is &quot;they're not balanced between small groups of PvP&quot; i swear.<br />
<br />
i'd talk about the other changes, but to be honest lets go with YAY more mounts. The guild one looks good.. there isn't enough mounts in game as it is...<br />
<br />
Funny thing is... who wants to bet, that all these new mounts are past the level 80 stage right.. so the only time we'll see them is in IF unless flying mounts are allowed inside ;) what it's true !<br />
<br />
<br />
ahh well, c'est la vie. lets all play forsaken hunters who can not only tame beasts (not sure, maybe they like decaying flesh) but they can fake death. They should get a bonus for that, lets face it if you see a decaying corpse fall down dead... you're thinking &quot;thats normal&quot;.<br />
<br />
as much sense as worgen rogues &quot;do you smell wet dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paladin changes - told ya, ret wise they've basically changed it to what it's more like now just with new skills. nice. thanks. Give it a week we'll be nerfed again. Telling ya blizz don't have a clue with the class, they're just hoping it works &quot;from the numbers&quot;</div></div><hr />

The last information I heard (before seeing TB's video mentioning the scorpion) Horde were getting a Thunderlizard guild mount (read: reskinned Kodo) which makes sense since the Lion is a reskinned nightsaber no matter how cool / bad it may look. If the Horde are getting a totally new mount model then it is unfair on Alliance, and I'm Horde.<br />

Lion/saber/tiger/panther - all cats, did you really expected unique animations + the new skin? Also a lion head has been the Alliance symbol for a while it's only appropriate to be a lion.

What are you talking about, this is the best cat model ever. Also the swift Sabers have had armopr on them since forever, there's a difference between having armor being part of the model and converting the armor worn on the humanoid models to be worn by cats/bears</div></div><hr />

Sooo... level 60s will have to pay 250 for Azeroth flying and 250 for outlands flying at the same level? That seems fairly stupid considering the whole lowering outlands flying level and cost requirement to make it more reasonable for people leveling in the first place.<br />

I know they arnt required and either way I have more than enough money, but it just doesnt seem to mesh very well.<br />

For that matter why would anybody leveling even want to learn Azeroth flying at 60 when the next 20 levels wont even touch Azeroth, just seems like a very odd place to stick it.</div></div><hr />

That seems fairly stupid considering the whole lowering outlands flying level and cost requirement to make it more reasonable for people leveling in the first place.<br />

I guess they put it there so that players who have the money can just fly anywhere they want and not have just the old (new) world where they need to use their ground mounts.</div></div><hr />
