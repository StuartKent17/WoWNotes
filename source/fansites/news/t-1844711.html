Armory Stats - Flying Achievements<br />
With flying just weeks away, it is time to see how players are doing on unlocking flight. The sample used today is 2 million players that have logged in since July 1st.<br />
<br />
We included the 200 Treasures achievement just for comparison purposes, only 100 is required for Master Treasure Hunter (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10348-master-treasure-hunter), which is required for Draenor Pathfinder (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10018-draenor-pathfinder).<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
WoW players: I'm quite curious to hear what you would like to see from Class Halls in Legion. What thoughts and fantasies excite you most? (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/630486340686053376))<br />
First and foremost, I want a believable reason that Warriors, the only class any race in Azeroth can pick up, are forming one.<br />
Agreed. It was an interesting challenge. I hope you like our take on it. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/630496064068415488))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
do you think that riot ganes would bring a mmo-rpg out?<br />
I'm not sure the business model is where it used to be. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620367930199412736))<br />
Would still be awesome to see what riot could do. I think it would be the only mmo which could stand a chance against WoW<br />
The problem is any new game gets compared to 10-year-old WoW not WoW's launch features. &quot;Where is group finder, transmog and MMR?&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620617670937829377))<br />
<br />
Im curious, how was the transition from an MMO game development setting to a MOBA one? @OccupyGStreet<br />
Things like satisfaction, responsiveness and fair competition are pretty universal to any multiplayer game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620634279484088320))<br />
I have found aspects of League development much more like my roots in RTS development though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620634357678473217))<br />
<br />
Dear angry MMOC poster, that probably wasn't me who banned your account seeing as how I was a game designer and not in account management. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620620231912722432))<br />

Crabs in Tanaan Jungle drop teeth. This crab fact travesty would have never happened on Ghostcrawler's watch.#WorldofWarcraft<br />
But northern hemisphere penguins happened on my watch. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620952283639971840))<br />
<br />
Why would you want it to be hard? There is no fun in wiping. There is no fun in frustration. I don't get this.<br />
Easy dungeons just have you AE everything and perhaps not even stick together as a team. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620951600043917312))<br />
Personally I prefer hard dungeons because they encourage me to think, coordinate and use abilities in creative ways (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620951417897877504))<br />
I also realize different players find different things fun. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620951740712529920))<br />
Finally, it's easy for dungeons to only be relevant for a thin slice of player progression, which makes me sad. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620951930802606080))<br />
Maybe the new design of having multiple difficulty levels help address that. IDK. I haven't played them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620952061794873344))<br />
I guess u don't see the issue with that. Get in get the marks move on. Not there to make friends.<br />
But I want to play the game, not grab marks ASAP then logout after 30 min. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620952939931119616))<br />
It's also fine if you and I want something different. Big games are supposed to have wide appeal. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/620953434913554432))<br />
<br />
In Wrath did you ever play as a disc priest with your name? I remember camping one in a BG and a week later, ret nerfs.<br />
Heh, no I played warrior and druid for much of LK then switched to Disc for ICC progression. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/621314941740384256))<br />

<br />
For myself, I don't have any more alts to level, I don't touch the shitty apexis grinds and I have all the ore and herbs in my garrison. Flight for me is pointless. I haven't even done any of the shipyard either.<br />
<br />
I only leave my garrison to collect some level 3 wolves and kill kazzak both easily done with flight paths. I also do ulduar for the mount. Despite this I have still made 1.2 million gold this expansion. <br />
<br />
So for me grinding flight is a waste of time and effort, and it seems a few others may agree.</div></div><hr />

Even the answer to the follow-up question about the Warrior hall &quot;It was an interesting challenge. I hope you like our take on it.&quot; It's already decided and done as far as they're concerned, just like with Garrisons, our 'feedback' means shit all.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
So now they are hyping up flight?<br />
It's just MMO-Champion hyping it up, there's nothing from Blizzard or anything about it. &quot;With flying coming soon, it is time to see how players are doing on unlocking flight.&quot; Still a little pointless to do this stuff now IMO though as we're stuck waiting f-knows how long for the testing of a pre-order patch... Even then, we know Legion will be out soon(kinda) which won't have flight until later in the expansion again. Is anyone who really cares about flying still playing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that will ruin your experience how? Does it matter if people can fly to them? They die before you can get to them on a ground mount anyways, if anything it will give you the opportunity to get to the thing before it dies as the more people who tag it the higher its life is and a ground mount wont get there in time because of the terrain slowing you down. Its a dumb argument to make, half a dozen in one hand and 6 in the other.</div></div><hr />

You cannot be happy and whatever Blizzard do it will always be wrong. Same with expansion - so much complaining and everyone knows better what would fix this game. I bet that as soon as Blizz would listen to Your specific wishes then you would be unhappy anway and complain like &quot;yea now they do that, no they do it wrong anway&quot; etc. Legion is already an answer to many people wishes (demon hunter hero class, Azshara back etc) with Blizz twist on it (as its them making game not wow fans) and yet all we hear its complain, not many people who say &quot;ah its exactly what I asked for&quot;. I am 100% sure that many of unhappy are those who earlier requested some expansion with Azshara, or demon hunter or fighting legion again. <br />
<br />
When it comes to flying it is totally unnecesarry in WoD. In Vanilla people didnt have flying and they did not complain then. There are many people who glorify Vanilla but as soon as they got xpac where they can't fly then they aren't happy even though they got same thing as in Vanilla. I don't mind flying in WoD but it won't change my decision if to subscribe one month longer or not. I doubt it will change anyone elses or just in minor extent so they do their flying achievement and then notice that flying is just a tool and not goal in itself.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard hasn't &quot;fulfilled&quot; anything this expansion in regards to flying. It's safe to assume the majority of players expected flying. They told us it was coming, then changed their mind, then changed their mind again after the backlash. Now we're at the end of another expansion waiting on a patch to enable something we should have had months ago. The only thing about the current requirements keeping anyone from having flying months ago was reputation with factions we couldn't access. This was merely a carrot on a stick to keep people subscribed.<br />

No the majority of the players don't read forums or patchnotes or anything outside of the game and even in-game they don't read everything. Once flying is available there suddenly millions of players will start to ask &quot;why can you fly and I can not? Where is the flight trainer&quot; and then have to learn the hard way how to unlock flying. <br />
<br />
Make the same poll 3 months after we can really fly and you will see that 2/3 of the players will have unlocked it.</div></div><hr />

You only need Revered. Takes like two weeks doing Tanaan dailies, probably less. Saberstalkers you can grind out to Revered in like an hour, two for exalted, or you can just do the weekly quest a few times.<br />

The real problem are garrisons and ships battles. This are the features which should be available for iPads or Phones as a mini games.

<br />
I used to play this game from the beginning of 2007 constantly, almost day after day. I never had a brake from this game since patch 2.0.12 until middle of WoD. There is really something wrong going on here and the route taken by Blizzard is devastating.</div></div><hr />

My Battle.net client might disagree with you, seeing as it displays a vignette saying: &quot;Wowhead has joined us to help you earn Draenor flight as soon as possible&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's just like when they said &quot;we don't think we're going to allow flight from now on in WoW&quot; the week they add a flying mount on the store. Communication is completely messed up, and makes me wonder who exactly is doing production (i.e. management) on that team...<br />

<br />
You don't quit over flying. You quit because flying is the last in a string of issues, none of which would be fatal in themselves, but all of which add up. Lack of content, social issues (your guild has vanished), etc. At one point, you're ready to quit, and flying becomes the final turn of the key that opens that door.</div></div><hr />

I've done all the quests.<br />
I've explored the entire map.<br />
I have over 550 pets and the few I don't have I don't want to go looking for on a ground mount.<br />
I play Horde and only do random BGs and the faction imbalance due to EMFH makes it frustrating and unrewarding.<br />
I'm a casual player since my guild quit playing in Cataclysm, and they gate LFR content.<br />
I don't want to level alts if I have to do those same quests over while being stuck to the ground.<br />

The only thing to look forward to is killing Archimonde and finishing the legendary ring, and I can't do either right now. They're not going to fix PvP, and who knows when 6.2.2 will be &quot;ready&quot;, which would at least give me more of an incentive to level alts.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm reading them wrong but you only need pathfinder on one character. So would the percentage be lower because alt characters be in the sample size of the chart? If so the chart is a little deceiving on the percentage of people who will be flying?</div></div><hr />

I already had all of the achievements for Pathfinder earned when 6.2 hit, except for Tanaan Diplomat of course.

I thought the same thing. &quot;Players&quot; needs to be defined. Characters or accounts? I've logged into 15 characters since July 1st, but only 6% of them (1) have the pathfinder achievement because that's all I needed to have.

Flying has been in the game for 8 years and is a very enjoyable feature of the game. The fact that WoD is a terrible expansion has nothing to do with the enjoyment of flying in game. The FACT that we still don't have flying in Draenor is clearly indicative of how badly the developers screwed up with WoD. <br />
<br />
I find the stats interesting because it does show a lack of interest in getting the achievement which probably will prompt the no flying crowd to claim it as a kind of victory. However, I expect it's more about the complete apathy that the subscriber base has toward WoD, in general. Can anyone doubt that the subscriptions are still dropping massively?</div></div><hr />

I'm right there. If I was still playing the game I would be sure to have this achievement done since I enjoy flying. But with how WoD turned out there is no way I was going to give them money for this expansion. Pathfinder is way too little and WAY too late. Legion doesn't look to be doing flying any favors either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, I quit and had a ton of ally/horde players. My mid-level dissatisfaction with WoD spiked when the developers started giving interviews in mid-May and said there would be no flying in WoD or in future zones (there goes my druid's flying form, my flying mounts I ground out drops or rep for, etc... not a happy player on that one!). I read what Ion had to say about their current vision and how they thought WoD was going and just didn't agree on most points. It is Bliz's game, but it is my time and money (or gold if you have enough for tokens, which I did for years!). I chose to spend my time and money (for final fantasy xiv) elsewhere.<br />
<br />
For me, it was:<br />
1) No flying in WoD or future zones (announced mid-May?)<br />
2) Killing dungeons by removing gear purchase/upgrade currency (which had existed as badges/justice/valor since some point in BC). In other words, their reward system changes made dungeons irrelevant. They also took the stand point after LK (I think) that you could have dungeons or raid tiers but not both. I love dungeons (tanking and healing them), so this was a big source of unhappiness for me. <br />
3) Garrisons (as implemented) was a bad idea. It totally disrupted the reward vs. engagement vs. time combo. The only thing more rewarding in the game was &quot;real&quot; (i.e. non-LFR) raiding. The farm in Mists was ok, the garrison was like the farm on steroids, but with the additional impact of helping to make crafting and gathering irrelevant.<br />
<br />
So, in summary they made the following parts of the game largely irrelevant in WoD:<br />
1) Flying mounts<br />
2) Dungeons (outside of 4 runs needed for legendary)<br />
3) Crafting (i.e. you could make money before via gear enhancements, flasks, etc)<br />
4) Gathering (i.e. you could make money before via mats used for gear enhancements, flasks, etc.)<br />
<br />
Combined, I'm just like, meh, I'll go play something else (after 10+ years of WoW, sadly).</div></div><hr />

Uh, yeah, but that's weekly. Not grinding like I was saying. I wanted to get it done.

<br />
<br />
This is a huge problem in the community today. Stupidity and ignorance.<br />
<br />
I'm probably one of the biggest pro-flight nerds there are out there, and I don't have the achievement. Why? Well the biggest reason is I'm busy with real life priorities. I don't put a video game over anything else. People who don't understand how someone can not have the achievement, probably need to re-evaluate their purpose in life.<br />
<br />
The other reason I don't have it, is that there is no flying yet in the game! I knew when pathfinder was first announced, that flying wouldn't actually be added for a long time. What's the rush? So you all rushed to get the achievement, only to say...&quot;cool, but I still can't fly&quot;?<br />
<br />
I suspect the percentage of completion is so small, because no one is playing this game anymore. Yeah 2 million were sampled, but how many of those actually do more than talk shit in trade or check their follower missions. The requirement to get flying is kind of steep. The way it was before, just the gold requirement, was kind of steep. I remember when people didn't have flying because they couldn't afford it, let alone have 280% flying. Blizzard is only digging themselves into a deeper hole of failure, if they continue this model. Draenor Pathfinder, is yet another Blizzard fail telling the players how to enjoy the game, instead of the player deciding. For example, even though I despise PvP, I can totally understand how a player that mainly PvP's would be pissed at the PvE requirement to get flying. They probably won't do it, then eventually, like over half of the playerbase so far this expansion, quit because they're not playing the game they want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it's not. There are a variety of factors influencing the rate of completion of the prerequisites for flying in WoD;<br />
<br />
1) as someone else pointed out there's no real rush since flying isn't actually available yet<br />
<br />
2) cost (time/effort etc) / benefit<br />
<br />
While the requirements to get flying are not flat out ridiculous the fact remains that due to the lack of World content and the relatively small geographic size of WoD there is, for the non pet/mount/ collectors and those who enjoy archeology, little or no reason to put ANY effort into getting flying at this stage of WoD.<br />
<br />
Personally, though I un-subbed back in May, I wouldn't bother getting flying in Draenor if I re-subbed even if the only requirement was the old 5000 gold it used to cost in prior expansions. Its simply not worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I view the achievement requirement to get flying, retarded. I want flying to be able to have fun doing achievements like that, and some of them I would never have done even with flying(like the Taanan one iirc). The way they have added flying back, solves nothing. To me, it's exactly as bad as being without flying. I haven't resubscribed yet, but think I am done with Draenor now, since I won't be able to fly before I do something I never wanted to do in the first place. I might check in for the next expansion, but I'll likely leave that one early as well if they use the same kind of approach to allow flying there.<br />
<br />
I don't mind no flying while leveling, but when I want to start playing at endgame, I want to do it my way. The way things has been done ever since TBC, with accessible flying. I played vanilla at endgame as well, but I was either farming at Tyr's Hand, in a raid, or leveling an alt. Running around on the ground gives me nothing. Nor does completing tasks I don't enjoy, but some things simply become more fun when I can fly while doing it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, good luck if you think that 6 million people will come back just because they will be able to unlock flying and that this will motivate them so much that they will do boring Pathfinder achievement and go through WoD content again even though they are bored with it. If people come back flying won't be the main reason they come back for.</div></div><hr />

I already had all of the achievements for Pathfinder earned when 6.2 hit, except for Tanaan Diplomat of course. I bought about 5 or 6 of the Legion medallions when I found out how bad grinding Saberstalkers rep was (I had already hit revered with the other two). I regret spending that gold a bit now since it's taking so long; I had time to wait. But it's not that big of a deal.<br />

I don't think I have the explorer achievement, but i do have loremaster. Why? Because Loremaster is fun, running around on the ground to discover the map isn't. I would however, have explored the map if I could fly.<br />

I do not appreciate running 100 different paths up a mountain before I finally find the exact path I need to take to reach that specific point. I do not appreciate being tricked by the map to think I have to go somewhere completely different than I am supposed to, just because it's close(but no cigar), and then have to run all the way around a freaking zone once more so I actually get to the correct location, that will show on the map as pretty much where I went first. I am sorry, but I really do not see the fun in that. And you can call me retarded for that, but I know I am in good company, 'cause I don't really believe that this isn't something everyone is familiar with, one way or another. Sure, it may happen with flying as well, but it is certainly not as unforgiving as it is when you are stuck to the ground.<br />

You only need Revered. Takes like two weeks doing Tanaan dailies, probably less. Saberstalkers you can grind out to Revered in like an hour, two for exalted, or you can just do the weekly quest a few times.<br />
<br />
I unlocked Draenor Pathfinder just doing stuff in Tanaan while saving up Apexis Crystals to get the Corrupted Dreadwing mount. Didn't even realize I was going to have it unlock when it did.<br />
<br />
To be honest. Being forced to do something I either do not like doing at all, or something I would normally &quot;build up&quot; over the entire course of an expansion, to unlock something I would normally be using from day one at max level, doesn't feel worth the effort. The cost of flying is so high to me, that I would rather stay offline for the rest of the expansion.<br />
<br />
For example. I do not do dailies. I might do the odd daily once in a while over the course of an expansion, but I will have to be in a special kind of mood to do them, and some dailies I will hate so much I will only do, or try them, once. Rep grinds - I will grind the rep I feel like grinding there and then. Not the one I am forced to do to unlock something that is so vital to me as flying(following my playstyle, I'd either be left without flying for the entire expansion, or in worst case based on previous years, for several expansions on said continent). If I do not wish to grind that specific rep, that specific day, I am going to have a terrible day online. It's a terrible game experience that isn't worth the reward in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, we only track level 100 characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this 15% of the characters or 15% of the accounts? Because I have one character that has completed ALL the flying stuff and I have logged in a total of 9 level 100s since the 1st of July...<br />
<br />
Players. Each player can have multiple characters and multiple accounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm reading them wrong but you only need pathfinder on one character. So would the percentage be lower because alt characters be in the sample size of the chart? If so the chart is a little deceiving on the percentage of people who will be flying?<br />
<br />
Nope. You can have one character or 100 characters, you are only counted once.</div></div><hr />

To each his own. When achievements first came out in the Wrath pre-patch, I already had a good number of the exploration ones completed off the bat since I had liked revealing all of the map when I was leveling. I went and explored all the zones I hadn't finished then. (And that was before flying was available in the vanilla zones, obviously.) I suppose I just like exploring. I'm also an achievement whore, and the exploration achievements are some of the easiest to get. Run here, there, and over there and then you're done. Practically free.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, I do those when I can fly. I like to fly. It's a whole lot more immersive to me than being stuck to the ground. In real life, there is no better place to be, than those places high up there when you get a huge overview of &quot;everything&quot;, it's fantastic in real life, and it's fantastic ingame. I like to fly, and I enjoy the game more when I can fly. I can only take being &quot;grounded&quot; for small amounts of time, like the leveling process. Then I'm occupied questing anyways, which I enjoy, as long as it isn't dailies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm Not saying 6 million people left because of flying. I'm saying a lot of the flyers left and have not come back. And even the ones playing right now most just do the follower missions and nothing else right now in 15 mins at max and they log out. And there is nothing for people to do even with the flying right now to make people want to come back. That why the front page is misleading. So many people not doing anything at all.<br />

<br />
Were you in a raid group? Cuz you can hit revered easy in an hour of grinding the mobs there and the four named elites. Every person you have in the group over five reduces the rep per kill. Starts at 25 for normal mobs without bonuses and 300 for the named.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I would change is to not have ilvl play any part in your PvP power. Not sure what they mean by &quot;you don't have to raid to get the best gear,&quot; if higher ilvl increases your power by any amount. Like does it stop at some point, or can you get good gear through dailies like Tanaan, or are there going to be PvP sets with slightly better stats in PvP than non-raid gear? I think they need to clear up how this works.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I might actually PvP this expansion past the first month. I like the first month when everyone is roughly equal, but later on you get people that have way more gear and I don't like having to keep both PvP and PvE gear up to date. I don't have that kind of time.</div></div><hr />

That being said, I think they way they gated flying is perfectly acceptable. Do the content and get flying. However, the delays, the dishonesty they keep calling 'miscommunication', the different answers from Blizzard, all made me lose any faith and trust I once had for Blizzard. But anti flyers, please keep misinterpreting the data, it makes you so much more toxic to the community than pro flyers ever were. &quot;Hey look! The completion rates are so low!

There could be a various amount of reasons for this. The easiest one to think of is, that most of the folks, to whom flying is real important, have unsubbed. Another would be there are people who are still slowly working through it, I know a number of my raiders only really have the raid time + maybe 3 hours a week. <br />

There are massive amounts of thread of people both here and on the official forum simply whining and complaining about when flying is going to be allowed in Draenor and no more than 15% have completed the Pathfinder Achievement, for which I am one that did complete it. Did had everything, but the Tanaan rep done within 3 days of actually being able to log on to the game, after the massive crappy launch. To see that only 15% have actually completed the achievement since July 1st, especially after more than a year of complaining here and elsewhere about flying being roomed. People still could not get off their butts to do an achievement to get flying back. <br />
<br />
This type stuff gives the opposition and Blizzard the ammo to prove that there are actually a very small portion of the player base that actually give a damn about flying. Just creating thread after thread gives the impression that there are actually more people, than there actually are not only giving a damn about flying. This graph is troubling in more than one way. Its a snapshot of 2 million players and not the categories of subscriptions/accounts that are usually used. If this is even remotely close to the actual number of overall people playing this game day to day now, then there is a much bigger issue than flying with this game going on right now.<br />
<br />
A lot of people who supported flying quit the game, for starters.<br />
<br />
As follow-up, the work involved to get all those achievements is somewhat daunting, especially given that it's relatively easy to level to 100 without even completing half of half of the zones. <br />
<br />
It is a logical fallacy to equate the low percentage to mean that no-flyers outnumber pro-flyers. <br />
<br />
Remember that this system, the &quot;do 90% of the content and a year later we'll let you have flying,&quot; is not necessarily what people wanted--but it's the compromise that Blizz gave them. I can't really blame people for not dropping everything, running out, and doing stuff (that they might not even care about) to get flying when Blizz still hasn't even announced when the patch will come--it keeps getting pushed back.</div></div><hr />

There are plans for players to be able to get great gear from PvP, but it may not be as easy as it is today. It may be easier for high rated players to get better gear than more casual players.<br />

Rofl, why would people come back for flying? What is there to fly to? It's not like there's awesome stuff to do in the WoD zones at max level, especially not stuff that everyone hasn't done already. People quit because the expansion was boring after leveling, their story telling sucked, garrisons were a major let down and they delivered 1/3rd the content of previous expansions.

Not sure I see the problem in calling something in this game a &quot;grind&quot;. Most of what you do in WoW is a grind - Reps, dailies, PvP, farming, achievements, etc. Almost everything is a grind. Might not be the most pleasant terminology, but it's accurate, and it is what most people call it.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure Blizzard's inflated egos took quite a hit once they realized how wrong they were. Instead of just giving flight back like it always has been, however. They decide to make everyone jump through hours of extra hoops. They punish us for hurting their pride. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see them look at these numbers and say &quot;see, no one really wanted to fly anyway, we were right all along.&quot; I want to fly, but i'm not jumping through their hoops. I unsubscribed instead. I have 5 level 100's. I have been all over Draenor stuck to the ground. WoW has been so successful for so long that they think they are invincible. Their comments about subscriber numbers not affecting their decisions is further proof of that. Their pride will be their kryptonite and they are holding it tight.</div></div><hr />

Yep. I wanted flying, used tokens to play over the past two months, only need one apexis daily to complete my &quot;Securing Draenor&quot; achievement which never appears to be made available for me to choose, and a rep grind which can't really be solo'd unless you're a masochist, and there are never any people in the group finder wanting to help grind it out.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will definitely use these completion numbers to wrongfully conclude that very few actually want flight; and might even go so far as to say that the majority of people who completed the achievement did so only because they're completists, not because they're pro-flight.</div></div><hr />

Or you could do the weekly, camp the 4 rares a bit and do the beast daily from Vol'mar when it's up and be done in a few weeks.<br />
Frankly, doing the other two factions proved more time-consuming compared to the saberstalkers.</div></div><hr />

I grouped up twice since 6.2 in Tanaan and both were for Kazzak. Everything else was Solo and I've had the achieve for Weeks.<br />

You can buy mission orders that will give you the quest for any of the apexis dailies of your choosing from the guy standing next to your garrison cache (at least, that's where he his located in the Alliance garrison) and it counts towards the achievement. The only one you can't buy is The Pit, but that one shows up so often anyways.<br />

<br />

I was just stating myself how the Saberstalkers rep is bad earlier in this thread, but this is a bit of a hyperbole here. There's almost always a group up for it when I have looked. And simply doing the weekly (King of the Jungle) and the Tooth and Claw daily whenever it shows up is enough to let you hit revered eventually. Won't be quick (in terms of days), but it will definitely be reachable.</div></div><hr />

There are massive amounts of thread of people both here and on the official forum simply whining and complaining about when flying is going to be allowed in Draenor and no more than 15% have completed the Pathfinder Achievement, for which I am one that did complete it. Did had everything, but the Tanaan rep done within 3 days of actually being able to log on to the game, after the massive crappy launch. To see that only 15% have actually completed the achievement since July 1st, especially after more than a year of complaining here and elsewhere about flying being roomed. People still could not get off their butts to do an achievement to get flying back. <br />
<br />
This type stuff gives the opposition and Blizzard the ammo to prove that there are actually a very small portion of the player base that actually give a damn about flying. Just creating thread after thread gives the impression that there are actually more people, than there actually are not only giving a damn about flying. This graph is troubling in more than one way. Its a snapshot of 2 million players and not the categories of subscriptions/accounts that are usually used. If this is even remotely close to the actual number of overall people playing this game day to day now, then there is a much bigger issue than flying with this game going on right now.<br />
<br />
I do data analytics for a living and it is nearly impossible to determine intent from usage numbers. Finding out why someone does or doesn't user your product typically requires actual user interaction via surveys, etc. For example, I quit in mid-June partially due to the no-flying announcement. I actually bothered to contact Bliz in game to actually ask for a refund of my remaining 4 months so that I could expressly provide feedback on why I quit (no-flying, lack of gear progression currency making dungeons irrelevant, garrisons too rewarding for little time/effort/engagement, garrisons making professins/gathering irrelevant).<br />
<br />
So, when Bliz said in interviews in mid-May and June that sub-losses were largely due to the cyclical nature of expansions, I completely lost faith in their leadership (although, obviously, I'm sure some of it was PR-spin). Yes, expansions are cyclical. And, yes, you can put out a product that disappoints and alienates long-term (10+ years for me) customers. Both can be true.<br />
<br />
I quit WoW at end of June (about mid-way through one of Ion's streamed interviews) for FFXIV and am enjoying the heck out myself. Sure, some of my enjoyment is due to &quot;newness&quot;, but it also has to do FFXIV putting a lot of effort into game system mechanics (such as the reward system), deep and clever in-game story-telling (as opposed to relying on books), and really nice artwork (both gear and environment has a lot of attention to detail).<br />

I'm not doing them because it's too daunting and not interesting. Had they put them in in the START of the expansion I might *consider* it since I would be more completed.<br />
I suppose numbers spoke and people don't like the fact that they are losing people due to their decisions. Sorry but I don't WoW *near* as much as I used to Flying is *a* part of that reason.</div></div><hr />

Finishing the Tanaan rep grind leaves me with basically nothing left to do in Draenor on that character besides raiding and I'm seriously uninterested in doing it again on alts. It's like someone taking your car away until you can prove to them you can get to work without it. Having to run through all the expansion content before getting flying feels like punishment from Blizz for all the people who wanted it back. If these poll numbers are an accurate representation of how many people have finished the achievement... yikes.</div></div><hr />

&quot;not interesting&quot; is key here. i did the achievement, but it was one of the most boring tedious activities i've done in WoW in a long time. The only reason I did it was because I thought it would make getting to / from raids faster and I was gullible enough to believe Blizz when they said it would be out roughly 3 weeks after HFC was launched. <br />
<br />
If I wasn't an active raider, and was still in the middle of the achievement when I realized that flying was still months away, I would have quit too. <br />
<br />
Games should be fun. Getting the pathfinder achievement is decidedly NOT fun (not just for me, but apparently a host of others).<br />

I enjoyed the questing and treasure hunting when WoD was new, but on subsequent pkaythroughs with alts it got old fast. When everybody was racing to 100 that first week, it took me two days longer than my fastest friend, but I saw all the stories told (as completely as they are presented. Blizzard is great at leaving things unresolved, saying, &quot;well that will be answered in raid content&quot; and then cutting said content). <br />
<br />
I guess it's just disappointing that they're doing this at the end of the expac. <br />
This would have been really useful back when i wanted to get my alts up and geared in 6.0/6.1. Now the only use really is going to be archaeology (thank god) and collecting the treasures in Nagrand that I skipped <br />
<br />
Overall the flying thing was handled extremely poorly and comes way later than it should. Earning flying is okay, but it shouldn't be gated until the content is already dull and in end drvelopment (waiting for next expac)</div></div><hr />

Loremaster is fun. Explorer without flying is the biggest pile of shit ever invented<br />
<br />
WoD Loremaster should take you to a ton of places that count towards Explorer, the areas you don't quite have finished could easily be reached on ground mount (the zones are relatively small and there are tons of flight paths) or by using the feather. I think the only places I hadn't completely explored while doing Loremaster were Nagrand and spires due to the apexis daily areas being out of the way. Many of those even have direct lines to if you do achievements for the garrison campaign, apexis dailies, or harrison ford. It's not even a question of if it is fun...As long as you thought loremaster was fun you should be extremely close to finishing explorer.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep. I wanted flying, used tokens to play over the past two months, only need one apexis daily to complete my &quot;Securing Draenor&quot; achievement which never appears to be made available for me to choose, and a rep grind which can't really be solo'd unless you're a masochist, and there are never any people in the group finder wanting to help grind it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Firstly, I really hope you realize you can buy that one apexis daily with 200 garrison resources...That's been available since 6.1<br />
<br />
Secondly, What aspect of Saberstalkers requires being grouped up? I actually really liked the system they designed for it. If you want to get it up immediately you can grind for a few hours, or you can spend a few minutes per week with he quest. Really confused about why you think it requires being grouped, I have yet to find a class/spec that can't at least solo the mobs or weekly quest targets with ilvl 660+, which is easily attainable in Tanaan. Even if you hate the grindy nature of it, the patch was released like 7 weeks ago and it should only take about 5 weeks doing just the weekly quest to get to revered (which should take about 5-10 minutes per week). I can understand skipping it a few times if you don't like doing it but if you really want the achievement it is easily attained by now.<br />
<br />
Additional note, this is the least grindy grind I have seen in this game. It takes about 1-2 hours to get revered by killing the mobs/rares (rare spawn about every 30 minutes and there are 4, each give 500 rep so that alone should be 4k rep per hour).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The part that requires being grouped up is the farm, as opposed to waiting on dailies. I can solo the mobs...with three minute cooldowns. Can't kite because shit gets pulled, and those mobs just wreck cloth. Maybe it's not a bad grind, but it's not 1-2 hours for revered solo.</div></div><hr />

Mmo-c can be great for information about high levels of play, but I do find that is a fairly negative community overall (correlation, but not causation: the more skilled you ate, the more prickish you are).

<br />
With the scaling back of gear. Normalizing everything so fresh level 110 is 7% Weaker than full raid geared player in pvp. With such little disparity between gears there's not much room for getting an advantage SO I feel like people will swarm to stronger classes more so. And there it is. This is why I think removing the pvp gear is shit. I also am going to miss the seperate pvp models. Cmon, season 2 warlock...gtfo. Pvp model weapons i heard of. But I think Blizzard is just caving in for noob scrubs. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET DEMOLISHED IN PVP WHEN YOU DONT PUT IN ANY EFFORT. THAT'S WHAT GIVES YOU A REASON TO STRIVE AND GEAR UP. 7%. Hit 110, oh hey, im as strong as rank 1 arena players. Stupid. Sure, I want prestige tags...thats what we want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the scaling back of gear. Normalizing everything so fresh level 110 is 7% Weaker than full raid geared player in pvp. With such little disparity between gears there's not much room for getting an advantage SO I feel like people will swarm to stronger classes more so. And there it is. This is why I think removing the pvp gear is shit. I also am going to miss the seperate pvp models. Cmon, season 2 warlock...gtfo. Pvp model weapons i heard of.

So, basically you are saying that &quot;you are supposed to get demolished&quot; even if you are a skillful pvp player vs unskilled BUT geared people.<br />
Make an effort should not be considered about getting gear but improving your skills.<br />
The rank 1 arena player will always be stronger than the just hit 110 (unskilled) player because of skills.<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Pre-Legion: Stronger = Geared<br />
Legion: Stronger = Skillful</div></div><hr />

No. That's incorrect. Wow has a very small ceiling for the best buttons at the time. It's always a very easy rotation. You run in, mortal strike blah blah blah key combo. Everyone does the same thing mostly. Now it's not going to be possible to kill 3 people with skill. You kill one person, that person is badly wounded because everyone is the same and they get killed by the third guy because half health. The endless dominoes. Sure a healer will change stuff. But that's kind of cheating now? Have a healer and win, dont have a healer and it's 50 50. It shouldn't be all about skill. You should be rewarded more for playing more. How fun is it going to be when youre 5% more powerful in pvp after 6 months of being 110 and still no stronger. No bigger numbers.....nothing exciting. If you want skill go play RBGs and arenas where everyone has the same gear. People play battlegrounds to get gear and to punish those getting gear. That's what makes it fun. Every once in a while a WSG will be an awesome 5 second to go 3-2 match with a photo finish. otherwise it's people trying to get stronger not testing their skill. Arena and rbg is skill/bot test.</div></div><hr />

I am one of those who thinks flying detracts more than it adds since you need huge maps to make it not feel like it dwarfs the game, but I try to keep an open mind about game changes.<br />
<br />
Vanilla Azeroth was definitely not easier to traverse than later expansions by any means. I think original Azshara is still the high benchmark in awkward for example. But it was still awesome. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
44% of the players that bought the expansion had already quit by June according to the last quarterly call. You can argue their reasons and make more assumptions, but if the forums were any indication when they announced &quot;no flying in Draenor&quot; a lot of people put their money where their fingertips were and unsubscribed because of it. Like me, they haven't come back yet.<br />
<br />
Are you joking? You really think people actually quit playing over flying? So when they patch it back in all these people will come back just to fly around? <br />
<br />
All that flying would have done for me is made me bored faster and quit sooner.<br />

It shows that flying wasn't THAT important after all. These people quit playing either way, they won't come back just to do some achievements and get the flying skill. Maybe some will but they won't last very long when they find the rest of the game utterly boring that it made them quit.<br />
<br />
This is really blowing my mind. How can people be so concerned about this. What exactly are you going to do when you get flying? Fly over draenor once and then quit again the next day? I really do not see how it's more fun to fly over dreanor than to ride through it. You do it once or twice and then you are done. The only thing flying gives is convenience that no one needs, you have garrisons ffs, how much more convenience do you need...</div></div><hr />

This is f**king insane. They remove every fun stuff from their game. Do you even remember the &quot;Insert&quot; trick flying upside-down? Ahhh good old days I miss those. :/<br />

GO to Stormwind and Fly upside down to your hearts content.<br />

<br />
After getting 90% of the way through the flight achievement, it's obvious that Blizzard decided that we can have flight once we've already done everything that might make flight relevant and useful.</div></div><hr />

Essentially, yes I did quit over flying (well, the announcement that it wasn't going to be implemented in WoD or any new zones). There were other issues I was having with the game as well, but the way Bliz announced the no-flying thing, combined with other things they said in that (and later) interviews made me think they had a vastly different view of fun and what a successful expansion looked like (i.e. the sub losses were mainly due to cyclical nature of expansions other than issues with WoD... which I disagree with quite a bit!).<br />
<br />
And no, I probably won't be back when flying is introduced because I went to another mmo (FFXIV) which reminds me of the fun I had in BC (I love dungeons!). I could have played WoW for free for the next 2+ years, instead, I'm paying a monthly fee, bought the base game, the expansion, and the signed up for 6 mos. And I'm a 10+ year WoW veteran (and played the RTS games before that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-legion: Stronger = played longer = Geared -&gt; Agree! You need the same amount of points to get gear. Then you need time to get points. It doesn't take the same time for each player but you can calculate an average.<br />
<br />
Legion: Stronger = played longer = Skillful -&gt; Nope! Some players can be skillful in a short time and other ones never.</div></div><hr />
