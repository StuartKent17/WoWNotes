Legion - Spec Swapping<br />
Legion removes the dual spec limitation in favor of allowing players to use all of their specs. Switching between specs currently costs 100g in the alpha, but this is just a placeholder. <br />

Patch 6.2.3 Hotfixes - January 20<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Glory of the Pandaria Raider (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6932-glory-of-the-pandaria-raider): Removed &quot;Getting Hot In Here (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6687-getting-hot-in-here)&quot; as a requirement for completing the achievement.<br />
Stamp Stamp Revolution (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8980-stamp-stamp-revolution): Characters with an immunity effect that get crushed by a stamping press should no longer incorrectly fail the achievement on Normal or Heroic difficulty.<br />
Tabard of the Argent Dawn (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2116-tabard-of-the-argent-dawn): Players who have completed the achievement are now able to re-purchase Tabard of the Argent Dawn (http://www.wowdb.com/items/22999-tabard-of-the-argent-dawn) from tabard vendors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Boost<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Seer Kazal (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/94870-seer-kazal) may not appear in the Garrisons of recently boosted characters during a Bonus Event.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion Combat Logs<br />
UPDATE: Bonus List IDs have been added into the item data, after the enchants. The new format will be...<br />
<br />
COMBATANT_INFO,playerGUID,Strength,Agility,Stamina,Intelligence,Dodge,Parry,Block,CritMele e,CritRanged,CritSpell,Speed,Lifesteal,HasteMelee,HasteRanged,HasteSpell,Avoidance,Mastery ,VersatilityDamageDone,VersatilityHealingDone,VersatilityDamageTaken,CurrentSpecID,(Class Talent 1, ...),(PvP Talent 1, ...),[Artifact Trait ID 1, Trait Effective Level 1, ...],[(Equipped Item ID 1,Equipped Item iLvL 1,(Permanent Enchant ID, Temp Enchant ID, On Use Spell Enchant ID),(Bonus List ID 1, ...),(Gem ID 1, Gem iLvL 1, ...)) ...],<br />
<br />
As usual, we're working on builds of the game that are ahead of what is on Alpha. This change will likely make it into the next Alpha build, but 100% certain. If not, it'll be in the one after that.<br />
<br />

FEEDBACK: Vault of the Wardens (Normal)<br />
Please use this thread to post any feedback on the Vault of the Wardens dungeon. When posting, please note your group composition and any relevant information about the nature of your group (e.g. random LFG group, Mythic raider guildmates, etc.). At this stage, a lot of overall combat balance is in flux, but we're still very interested in hearing overall feedback and impressions of the experience and mechanics.<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
[I]Which WoW expansion was your favorite to play? To design?<br />
Probably LK. I was relatively new to WoW dev (I worked a little on the end of BC) so I was still in &quot;I can't believe I'm here&quot; mode and I didn't know what was impossible yet so I tried crazy stuff.<br />
<br />
As a player, it was also a sweet spot, as I suspect it was for many players. The things that eventually grew tiresome about the game (for me anyway) hadn't yet grown tiresome. Just exploring the world was still fun. My guild was younger with fewer families, so we could be more hardcore and accomplish a lot.<br />
<br />
It's interesting to me that both those answers have a lot more to do with my emotional state of mind than say features or story or development environment.<br />

<br />
A couple reasons, first to make specs feel solid and something you choose to stick with, not just another menu like talents have become. Second, because it's been a natural part of the game since its inception.<br />
<br />
There needs to be something in there to keep you playing that spec throughout a raid period, and not get people complaining about needing 3 sets of gear to function in all specs to change between every other fight.<br />
<br />
I'm a fan of the idea to increase the price the more you use the function, start with a free swap then work your way up based on how often you change it. Have like a monthly reset in gold price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something you can purchase for a small amount of gold, but it can also uncommonly drop from mobs/bosses/garrison-mission-equivalents (also like Tome of the Clear Mind from Draenor Garrison missions) that offset your cost and encourage playing the different facets of the game.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't even make sense within the basic conventions of the game.<br />
<br />
You always pay gold to another character, or to an NPC. Gold has never been a currency that can simply disappear from your inventory in a transaction with the UI. Even the game time token is something you buy from the AH. Who is the character paying this gold to when changing his spec? Himself? Is he making a mechanical transaction directly to Blizzard? Paying gold directly for swapping your spec is inherently awkward.</div></div><hr />

I currently swap between all three of my warrior's specs at least 50 times a week. I swap specs for running dungeons, questing, raiding, LFR, pvp, Ashran, battlegrounds, arena, everything. <br />
If an hour passes and I haven't swapped specs, something is wrong... So yeah, no thanks on gold cost.<br />
Just let me press a fucking button. And fix it now, I hate having to redo my action bars every time, because i can only have 2 specs on Live.</div></div><hr />

That should be done with gear, especially the Artifact, not a gold cost every time you want to switch. If it goes live it will be quite annoying for healers. They're boosting the damaging spells so that we can solo quests, but the simple fact is that it will never be as efficient as a DPS spec. My Holy Paladin has no reasonable AoE, not even with the changes so far. I would never try to solo old content or endgame dailies as that spec when I could have access to a much better toolkit with Retribution. It's ridiculous to have a penalty for being a healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd give tank/healer some leeway on it though for overall community benefit.<br />
<br />
What that cost should be - maybe like reroll tokens you should have an option of various payment methods.<br />
<br />
e.g. choice of 100g+ (increasing) or &lt;insert current currency&gt;, or a cool down per spec.<br />
<br />
But now you can be all three specs, not having a cost really dilutes the meaning of spec to 'stance' almost.</div></div><hr />

The introduction of spec swap on the fly isn't meant to allow you access to do everything and be anything freely. It's meant as a QoL improvement from having to go to the trainer every time you want to swap. It has always, and should always cost something to give the specs meaning. Otherwise why not get rid of specs entirely and give all abilities to the class itself and be done with that system?</div></div><hr />

In my raid that has allways been me and 1 other player. There are even times where i have to tank. So sometimes i´ve been switching between 3 speccs, where even now i have to pay an annoying amount of gold for. I cannot imagine to pay gold for every specc swapp. That´s just too much. So i really hope, that respeccing is cheap or costs no gold. Upgrading 2 artefact weappons should allready be enough of a hassle.</div></div><hr />

Yep..I would even prefer only keep free dualspec like it is atm than paying in legion just because we can switch between our 3 specs. So freaking stupid move from blizz to add a cost to it..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I remember vanilla days, I was one of those retri paladins who faked that they had respecced, cause respeccing for every damn raid was so much fun. Losing so much gold. Especially in Legion without easy gold from Garrisons it'd be tiresome to have to pay for it again.<br />
<br />
It's gotta be free, else I am sticking to one spec per class for the remaining expansions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsmania</div><div class="date">2016-01-21, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Respeccing shouldn't cost at all because it's not balanced: mages, rogues or warlocks could be an entre expansion using the same spec; a pala or a druid would respec several times. A leveling healer shouldn't be punished for queuing with one spec and soloing on other, while a pure DPS doesn't need to. That would harm leveling queues for instances.<br />
I'm not against gold sinks, they serve a purpose for balancing economy, this one is just unfair. Earning &quot;spec slots&quot; with exponentially increasing prices or paying for overriding a reasonable cooldown would be a better model.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-01-21, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Swapping specs should be free. With healers the only ones to rez, if the healer dies but not everyone else, that means everyone else either have to sit there and twiddle their thumbs as the healer runs back, someone has to change specs to rez, or they just kick the healer. At the current cost, to rez someone for a non-healer is 200g! That excludes the price for mana drinks to get your mana up after spec swapping to rez to begin with. How many people want to pay 200g to rez someone? And if either the tank sucks so the healer dies to aggro or the healer dies to random things constantly, you could be spending 1000g+ a run to rez a healer. I can see people requesting the healer start to pay to be rezzed which would mean the healer's not only out 200g for the other person to spec swap but also the cost of repairs for themselves (assuming the two are on the same server anyway). A single death for me at 10% durability right now is nearly 100g! In Legion, I wouldn't be surprised to see 200g per death. So a healer who has to pay to be rezzed would then be out 400g per death!<br />
<br />
With my healers, they tend to be in their DPS specs when I'm not doing heroics or raiding. To swap to healing for those two activities means I'm out 200g immediately unlike someone else who may never swap at all. Why should I be penalized for swapping to heals to help out other players?<br />
<br />
Even if swapping only cost a tome like glyph swapping, that still adds up.<br />
<br />
I'd say add a 5 minute CD but that'd screw over a tank or DPS who swaps specs to rez a healer and then swap back.<br />
<br />
So spec swapping should be free.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's really trying to kill offspecs it seems. Artifacts, removing things like rez from non-healers, having to pay to change specs. Legion's looking less and less fun with each day.<br />
<br />

Yeah, just testing it now. It is a little bit of a hassle to vote the first time, as you have to authorize access to a list of your characters. After you do it once though, you can just click the button every 30 days to renew access and vote normally.</div></div><hr />

There needs to be something in there to keep you playing that spec throughout a raid period, and not get people complaining about needing 3 sets of gear to function in all specs to change between every other fight.<br />
<br />
I'm a fan of the idea to increase the price the more you use the function, start with a free swap then work your way up based on how often you change it. Have like a monthly reset in gold price.<br />
<br />
1) Until you aren't the flavor of the month and you get benched unless you switch to &quot;X&quot; spec. Anything remotely spec and or class specific in the way of talents has been shit on, wiped on Holinkas ass, then thrown in the trashcan in the name of convenience LONG ago<br />
2) Like...what? An idiotic charge to make sure you dont have fun? <br />
3) Hope you plan on volunteering your gold to your guilds tanks and healers...otherwise enjoy a lot of progressing though nothing as they say fuck it and quit....<br />

I don't want to be one of the people crying about &quot;it shouldn't cost anything!&quot; because I remember the days of Vanilla where there wasn't a straight up swap option with a one-time fee, but a &quot;start from scratch&quot; option that increased each time you did it (at least that's how I think I remember it working). Still though, I was a masochist in those days and leveled my paladin to 60 as Holy, so I never really had to switch when I went from questing to when I was in a party...<br />
<br />
Still though, since they introduced dual specs, I've just become accustomed to questing and spending most of my time solo as Ret, then whenever I group up with friends/guildies/PUGs swapping out to Holy and getting my heals on. Seems shitty now to go back to how things were in the stodgy Vanilla days, especially after they put both sets of stats on gear so you didn't have to lug around a bag full of your off-spec's armor for when you swap.<br />
<br />
I know they've said Holy is going to be more combat-viable, should I be expecting to be able to do more as Holy without swapping to Ret (inb4 'you can solo HFC heroic as Holy pally lolol', I'm not worried about dying, I'm worried about it taking 5 minutes per mob to get through any content solo as Holy).</div></div><hr />

Thing is how is that any different to just paying out gold each time? People are complaining about it costing anything this idea is still that but in another form..<br />

<br />
There are two reasons I'd be annoyed if it goes live like this.<br />
<br />
1) We already have access to two specs after a one time 10g unlocking fee. I'd find it super weird if they take this away. If they let us unlock a secondary spec that we can switch to for free, I'm totally ok with the third/fourth spec costing gold to switch into.<br />
<br />
2) 100g or even if they reduce it to 10g might not seem like a lot, but it will add up fast if you actually play multiple specs. Isn't it enough that we have to spend time and effort on multiple artifacts? I like healing occasionally just for a faster queue to random heroics, will I feel that's worth it in Legion if I have to pay to do so? I'm guessing I'm not alone thinking like this either = fewer tanks and healers will queue and wait times go up.</div></div><hr />

I like this idea, I was going to post and say it shouldn't cost gold but something else. This is a nice balance. Paying gold directly to yourself is silly. Make it a crafted consumable, or maybe like engineers can make a robot to do it for everyone around. Something about doing it with no cost on all your specs doesn't make specialization very important.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but if it costs me half the gold from a CTA satchel to switch to tank and back, I'm certainly going to re-evaluate whether it's worth maintaining an extra set of accessories, trinkets, and keeping up my other artifact's relic level and AP.

<br />
You always pay gold to another character, or to an NPC. Gold has never been a currency that can simply disappear from your inventory in a transaction with the UI. Even the game time token is something you buy from the AH. Who is the character paying this gold to when changing his spec? Himself? Is he making a mechanical transaction directly to Blizzard? Paying gold directly for swapping your spec is inherently awkward.<br />
<br />
They could always just take it off the UI and force you to visit a class trainer again, would you prefer that?<br />

This is exactly what I was talking about. I like to heal in 5-man+, I like to DPS when questing. I shouldn't be charged for that, no matter the fee or no matter &quot;the pittance&quot; the elitists are claiming 100g is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't about &quot;choosing the lesser evil&quot;, it's about pointing out the problems with a potential system while it's still in Alpha.<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge, there is no other instance in WoW where you can use gold NOT as an in-game currency, but as a UI currency for transactions with your own menus.<br />
<br />
The idea of using spec changes for a gold sink is bad to begin with, but yes, a tradeable reagent, like the Tome, would be better, even if it did cost 100 gold at a vendor, because they could implement additional sources to provide a limited supply to people changing specs for LFG, and it can be provided by the guild bank in the case of raiders, all without breaking the fantasy conventions of the game.</div></div><hr />

Cause you'd have every jack-off not comitting to a specific spec and just running whatever's most op. Pic a spec, learn it, master it, make it your bitch. Being able to use all specs when they're all completely different does immense harm to the gaming community.</div></div><hr />

At a minimum I would daily be looking at - swapping to shadow for daily stuff, swapping to holy for raid, then rinse and repeat every day. The &quot;can you come heal a dungeon for us&quot; would mean additional spec swaps. <br />
<br />
I find guild interaction/social interaction very different now than it was in the early years. Back in the day when you had to relearn a spec - their was more social interaction in the guild, and the leveled holy in vanilla priest got lots of friend support so did not have to change spec. Perhaps this is another reflection of GC's comment &quot;My guild was younger with fewer families, so we could be more hardcore and accomplish a lot&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is a GOLD SINK, it is the most unimaginable (lacking any real creativity or thought) 'feature' Blizzard could come up with... c'mon. <br />
<br />
If there is another reason for any COST at all, what is it? I don't understand.<br />

<br />
Because gold is likely to inflate further next expansion, and people need something to spend it on. We currently have a system where for no effort at all, you can earn 1000+ a day on a single character on average over a week. That's insane when spends on repairs and consumables for a hardcore raider amounts to a fraction of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that 1k gold was a one-time fee, after which you could freely switch between both specs on the fly, for free. This new proposed cost is not to unlock one's tri-spec, it's a fee you pay every time you switch between whichever specs you have. That's why people are confused and irritated, because switching between unlocked specs has been free ever since dual-spec was implemented, there was only the one time fee. With this you'd pay X amount of gold any time you go from healer to tank to healer to dps, etc. Over the course of an expansion that adds up to a lot of money, especially if you actively play multiple specs.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you want to change your spec completely, there's currently a fee, and I don't think anyone objects to that, but there's no need for that in Legion since we have all specs available to us. Why then would we have to pay gold every time we activate a different spec when that exact same process is currently completely free of charge? It's a step backwards and an awkward gold sink. <br />
<br />
If it's there to discourage players from changing specs too much, why then bother to implement this tri-spec in the first place when the current system works fine? The whole spec-change cost feels extremely out of place, and looks more like an attempt at creating an entirely unnecessary hurdle rather than to improve on existing systems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess I'm a Jack off for switching between Sub and Combat as rogue depending on the fight in raiding so.<br />
<br />
From entering HFC to completion I swap specs a lot.<br />
<br />
Enter: Trash Combat &gt; Assault Combat &gt; Reaver Sub&gt; Trash Combat &gt; Kormrok Sub/Combat &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Council Sub&gt; Trash Combat &gt; Kilrogg Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Gorefiend Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Socrethar Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Iskar Combat/Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Zakuun Sub &gt; Xhul'horac Combat &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Velhari Sub &gt; Mannoroth Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Archi Sub.<br />
<br />
Doing older content, and running older raids? Combat.<br />
<br />
Sticking with a single spec only is extremely silly, especially since you play a Class, not just a spec.<br />
Blizzard trying to tie people into a single spec for legion is all weird. Everything from a single artifact per spec with no ability to transmog between them, having to grind artifact power for each spec, and now adding this.<br />
<br />
You don't simply pick a spec and stick with it until the end of the expac, not when you do several things or even raid. You play what's the best for your raid and class to progress.<br />
<br />
There's absolutely no harm done to the community because you can play what's optimal, especially when you can play it all optimally. The only way Blizzard can avoid this backlash is if every DPS or HPS spec for the a class were essentially the same performance wise, and everyone knows that's not going to happen.</div></div><hr />

What I am surprised about all of this is I have (though not really bothered looking) yet to see people start saying they are going to cancel their sub and not buy Legion over this.. Though I don't expect it will be long before they do, and all I can say to that is if they are willing to quit the game over what is relatively minor annoyance well then..<br />

That's an &quot;apples and oranges&quot; comparison, and I believe you're quite aware of it. Letting players freely swap among specs is not the same as letting them use all abilities from all specs at the same time. I have to drop combat, wait several seconds, and in many cases wait for resources (mana, energy, etc.) to regenerate before jumping into action in a different spec.<br />
<br />
You're trying to depict a &quot;slippery slope&quot; situation here, but in this case the slopes exist on different mountains in different countries.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fog</div><div class="date">2016-01-21, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple reasons, first to make specs feel solid and something you choose to stick with, not just another menu like talents have become. Second, because it's been a natural part of the game since its inception.<br />
<br />
There needs to be something in there to keep you playing that spec throughout a raid period, and not get people complaining about needing 3 sets of gear to function in all specs to change between every other fight.<br />
<br />
I'm a fan of the idea to increase the price the more you use the function, start with a free swap then work your way up based on how often you change it. Have like a monthly reset in gold price.<br />
<br />
Artifacts is enough to make your spec &quot;special&quot;. There's no need to add the gold cost.<br />
I know I'm in the minority here, but on a raid night I alter between my 2 specs nearly every other boss. That'll be 600 gold at least per farm night. I don't see how that's justified.<br />
Noone in their right mind would want to balance their artifact power between their specs and rather focus on their primary spec. As a DPS warrior, I got no idea how this will work in Legion, or how limited we'll be. As a end game raider standpoint, I stand to be frustrated in Legion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torm</div><div class="date">2016-01-21, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should be fixed price to learn the spec. Basicaly first you choose on lvl 1 (or 10 or w/e) is free. Second at lvl 50 should be like 100-250g, Third at lvl 100 could be like 1000g or something similar. In case of druids you could learn 4th spec at lvl 100 aswell, for similar gold cost as 3rd. That would seem to be fair to me. Swapping between them should be free since you already bought.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drdonkeyburgers</div><div class="date">2016-01-21, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would much rather pay a lump sum to unlock a 3rd spec than even a small fee every switch. It just feels wrong and for some people would be more expensive to do it this way. We already are going to need to invest time, energy, and currency to advance off specs due to artifact power.So why make us pay more just to play an off spec? <br />
<br />
I will not personally quit over this, but it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth and is just one more straw on the camel's back. It should probably be totally free, including no fees to unlock additional specs, however, due to the fact that we currently pay a lump sum to use a second spec and a fee every time we want to trade one of those 2 out for another, I can't say I don't understand how they came to this idea. <br />
<br />
People who will continue to play only 2 specs will now have to pay every time they want to switch when they've been doing it for free for years, after a one time fee of course. (we don't know how much work artifact power is really going to take yet, and some simply won't have interest in a 3rd spec)<br />
<br />
Lastly, as many others have said, there are far better things that could be turned into a gold sink, things to advance a character, instead of a feature that allows the hardcore to adapt to each individual fight and the casual to change their play style when they feel the desire. Again, we will already have to invest time and currency to advancing an off spec, why should we be paying every time we want to play it?</div></div><hr />

at 100g.. will really get negative feedback, being able to freely swap specs is part of the fun, and will make players less willing to try different specs on a whim(yes 100g is nothing these days, but it adds up.. and fast, seeing as I have changed specs on 1 toon over 20x in a single day)</div></div><hr />

100g cost is so minimal, and you arent likely changing specs that frequently for it to even become an issue<br />
<br />
Funny. Maybe those who play dpsonly classes don't change specs too often but I play healer as main spec and do solo stuff on my dps spec. I change spec maybe 1-4 times a day depending if I go on a raid (or a few), join world boss group or do some dungeon. I do group stuff as healer (always) but I always do quests, old content raids etc as dps. If I had to pay 100g each time I respec I would never sign up for Rukhmar as healer (just one example).<br />
<br />
What I try to to say is that if it is costly to change spec it will be way harder to find healer/tank for LFR and LFG (aswell as for world bosses). This because people will be less willing to pay fee to respec(this unless fee is ridiculously small like 1g) just for a moment unless its a guild progress raid. I played in BC where it was a bit like they want to make it in WoD so you could play healer and do quests (yey wand talent on priesty!), it cost much to respec (progressively) and it didnt work so well. If they force payments then many people will probably have two classes to do different stuff with, one dps to do dailys, fun solo stuff, rares and one healer/tank spec to do raids and dungeons. <br />
<br />
Healers are never good in solo play. Have you seen many healers doing old world stuff or questing in their healing spec? There are some tanks but healers are just slow in most of cases and too fragile. In WoD they say healers will be soloing quests but they wont be as strong as dps so if it will be 3 times slower to do quests as healer, then nobody will want to do them unless they have to (for the raiding artifact purposes). This unless they implement healer/tank dailies where those specs will actually get to use their spec skills instead of doing dps quests in wrong spec.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind having third spec fee, even a high one like 10 000 g. If it was one time price and you had free dual-spec then it would feel optional and once you unlocked it then you wouldnt need to consider if its worth to respec and do that world boss as healer when raid is asking for some people to heal as they cant find enough healers.</div></div><hr />

find strange pay gold to respec/ chance spec. its basicly the same, you just have bars saved is only difference.<br />
<br />
Basicly you just respec like currently do, like old days, blizzard just remembers your bar settings before you respeced.<br />
<br />
infact what they do is remove duo spec and go back to old 1 spec, pay gold to respec, only positive now is your bars are saved.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To be honost, they just trow duo spec in the can, rename respeccing to spec switching with saved bars. but basicly you just respec like old days.<br />

100g cost is so minimal, and you arent likely changing specs that frequently for it to even become an issue<br />
<br />
I can change specs 5 or 6 times a night on my healer/dps characters. This just feels punishing to play the game. It should be free at this point. No stupid materials, no visiting class trainer, nothing. It is already going to be a night for the artifact weapons to deal with this issue. <br />
<br />
I don't get Blizzard. This is like taking 1 step forward, 10 steps back with this. Yes I know it is a place holder ammount, but that means they intend to have some cost. I don't want this. Just let me have my current dual spec system.<br />
<br />
Also, stuff like this is why you don't pre-purchase. It rewards dumb thinking like this because it says as a consumer you approve of these actions. That is why you pre-purchased the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Your back in the day was my back in the day. You are misunderstanding what Blizzard is wanting to do, my friend. They want to charge you every-time-you-change-specs. Not a one time fee.<br />

Back in MY day, you had to pay an increasing amount every time you changed your talents. That was the old way of changing specs. You also had to go to your trainer to do this as well.<br />

100g is nothing. If they dont nerf garrison gold gain... you can literally get 100g per day from those missions... more often than not, even more.<br />
<br />
This is not vanilla... not even close... so 100g is absolutely nothing. <br />
You are not changing your spec for 100g just once? thats ludicrous... if your spec sucks, 100g to change it once is not a big price.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfie of Medivh</div><div class="date">2016-01-22, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">why should spec swapping cost gold in the first place?!<br />
<br />
Well, if I had it my way, you'd designate a first, or Main Spec, and a Second spec. Then you can swap to a second one for free anytime. Switching to a third or fourth costs an increasing amount of gold - starting at just 20 but going up to a high of 100. It never costs anything to go back to your main or secondary spec (so you can easily go to a healer for a fight and back to DPS.)<br />
<br />
Let's say Lemmy the Shaman plays Enhancement for his Main, and Resto for his secondary. Second boss in EN, they need an extra heal. He can spec to healing at no cost. After that boss he goes back to Enhancement, at no cost. On the 5th boss they need him as Elemental. He can go Elemental, but it costs him 20 gold. After that, he can finish the raid as Enhancement or Resto at no cost.<br />
<br />
Kaz the Druid is Guardian main spec, Resto secondary. He tanks 1 fight in Bear, second boss in Tree (no cost) but the next boss in EN but the next fight is a one-tank fight, so he can go Kitty. 20 gold. He stays kitty until the the fifth fight, where they need another ranged. He can go Moonkin, but it'll cost, say, 30 gold. Last fight he's back to tank, no cost to go back.<br />
<br />
All we want is to prevent someone from changing pull-to-pull. Not that it'll be feasible early on with the time it'll take to earn Weapon Power, but still, effort here.</div></div><hr />

You are bastardizing dead horse words to make a weak point that is not changing anyone's mind.<br />
<br />
Let's say you are in a raid or running PvP- BGs or Arena. You will be swapping specs off and on through out the next few hours. Today you can do it for free. In Legion, you better have extra gold to throw away.<br />
<br />
Please explain to me why anyone should have to pay 1G to change specs? What makes you such a 'hardcore' player because you spend gold to change specs? <br />
<br />
Entitled would mean you believe you are owed rewards in game only because you pay a sub. Entitled is NOT questioning why another artificial hurdle is being thrown into the game.<br />
<br />
Yes. Us old timers remember having to pay more and more every time we changed talents to change specs or just to reconfigure our talents. We also had to go to a trainer. That was SOOO wonderful if you were in the middle of a raid and someone had to drop. Now let's either quit for the week, find someone else, or borrow gold from someone.<br />
<br />
SOOOOOO cutting edge!<br />
<br />
You win the argument that you waste more time than the rest of us. Good job, chief.<br />
<br />
The fact that you used the word 'casual' tells me you got suckered into Blizzard's trap of fussing over the red herring of casual vs hardcore. Blizzard wants players to fight among themselves over this because it hides the real issues with the game. My God. People cannot even agree what casual or hardcore means. And do not get off on a tangent fussing over what you think they mean. That will just prove my point.<br />
<br />
The real issue with WoW is between those who want a challenging, rich in lore MMORPG and those players who do not want to think about anything, who do not want to read quest texts, who want easy mobs to kill, and easier and easier raids, dungeons, and for their class to be the most powerful.<br />
<br />
Stop using cliche's. Explain in detail what you mean without using words like 'casual', 'hardcore', or 'entitled'. 99% of most people see what your wrote and ignored it.</div></div><hr />

I raid end game content. I gladly respec to prot if needed for raids. Specs already means little. You just go to your trainer and respec. Dual spec helped ease on that, though I play a DPS warrior, and I got 2 DPS specs I use for raids normally. I rather have a 3rd spec option (4th for druid) than have a gold fee every time we switch spec.<br />

Sorry but this is incredibly short sighted. I switch specs 4-5 times a day. I am holy for dungeons/pvp, I go ret for raids and dailies. Often in raids I am also switching to holy as a back up healer. This current setup would end up costing me 3-4k gold a week. It is a rediculous idea and is going to make the tank and healer shortage even greater. The cost needs to be scrapped, it serves no purpose except to punish players for filling multiple roles.<br />
<br />
I get the impression you think this cost is for respec'ing. It is NOT. This is the cost of switching from one spec to the other. Currently we have dual spec and it is free to switch. In legion it costs 100g every time you switch.</div></div><hr />

The good news is the artifact system with its relics and whatnot seem to support the idea that you should commit to your chosen spec. The challenge will be enabling people who decide they'd like to play a different spec to be able to switch to it without playing weeks of catchup while simultaneously not making it possible (and thus mandatory for progression) to be able to swap into any spec between encounters.</div></div><hr />

It's dumb because spec swapping is currently free with Dual Spec.<br />
This change would essentially be a downgrade back to before Dual Spec was added, just without the requirement of going to your trainer.<br />

<br />
Classes with other than dps specs would suffer from it, while pure dps classes tend to play a whole raid tier on one (the OP) spec.<br />
<br />
If to define a price, then that should be the highest (101+), and so veterans would feel something from swapping specs. In this case newcomers could not afford changing specs freely at every boss according to raid preference.<br />
<br />
I feel the Dual Talent system is basically good, but should be expanded, so every class could have a presaved setting for every spec. 3 save slots for almost every class, but for example for druids 4 slots.</div></div><hr />

But current raiding enviroment requires you to swap spec often during single raid... maybe even if most people don't have to do it, I play healer who swap to DPS every 2nd fight.. <br />
Whatever you say, raiding is about killing bosses.. DPS kills bosses.. tanks and healers are just nessesary weight the raid needs to carry while DPS will deal with encounter. Any time you can switch healer to DPS you will do it, because that what all encounters are about.<br />
I doubt that this mentality will change in single expansion, so the spec changing fees will only hurt people who do their best for guild.</div></div><hr />

This sounds so awful and arbitrary if they implement it like this, though.<br />
<br />
Say you swap to healing for one raid encounter because your guild/pug wants some more healing, then swap back after that fight. Grats, as thanks for helping your fellow raiders at, you've been charged 200g for swapping twice. No one else has to pay a copper!<br />
<br />
Say, inevitably, at least one class has a DPS spec that's very strong for PVP, but very weak for PVE and another DPS spec that's the opposite. You want to do an arena or two between raids/dungeons/dailies? Yeah, that's 200g. What a great incentive for exploring the different aspects of the game! It's a big middle finger to people who play different roles in PVP and PVE or even just tanks/healers doing solo content as well. All the while, people who just play one spec for whatever reason arbitrarily don't have to pay anything.<br />
<br />
People saying that a free switch would hurt spec integrity and make people feel obligated to master all of their specs so that they can switch them to excel on particular fights: this basically already happens with dual spec. Even for classes with 3 DPS specs, it's usually the case that one will be appreciably better at AoE and another will be better for ST. People in progression guilds often do this and I've never heard complaints about it. Besides, it's ridiculous to punish people for learning more of the game.<br />

Honestly, I'd prefer just leaving it at the current dual spec system than switching to this nonsense.</div></div><hr />

Before Crystallized Fel, there were only 3 of our raiders swapping specs for 3 fights in HFC and two of them were the same damn class. Give the players an inch, the gold bars get too heavy. It's a convenient QoL change for the &quot;oh cool I got a shield&quot; players.<br />

Because Blizz previously told us they were upgrading Dual Spec to let you swap to any of your class's spec.<br />
Not that they were going to downgrade Dual Spec to charge you every time you change to your secondary.</div></div><hr />

I wanna throw in here that as far as I know in the alpha swapping talents is free. Right now swapping talents costs gold but specs does not. They could just change that to that swapping specs costs gold but talents are free. Also there won't be glyphs that need to be changed. It's just a small fee but propably the fee for changing specs will be about the same or comparable.<br />
This could also be the gold gain for inscription people after getting rid of glyphs. Preparing for a raid? Better get those Spec-Swapping-Materials. No one is crying about flasks or potions not being free.<br />
<br />
Usually, players don't swap specs because they like to do this. They either have their favorite spec which is not suitable for every content they want to play (like healers and solo questing), or they are social and help the group out (a dd who goes tank or healer for a fight). Therefore, changing specs should not be discouraged by a fee.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I change spec on my paladin 1-4 times a day. I heal dungeons, raids, world bosses. I dps only solo stuff as its cumberstone to do it as healer. I wouldn't mind fee if I didnt need to respec but dps is always faster when doing quests so it is punishing to have to either plan (to minimize respecing a day) when to quest and when to help guildies in dungeons or just use my alts for the gold farming.<br />
<br />
I know in Legion Blizz says people will do questing in tank/healer spec but yet they say that these specs wont be as good dps as usual dps spec. This means that questing will suck. I doubt Blizz is making healer/tank specific quests where you run around and heal groups of NPC. <br />
<br />
I already think that this artifact thing is bad but I accept and understand it. I dont require having leveled up artifiact for my dps spec, just to be able to do quests or do a dungeon as dps from time to time. It is good that artifacts will reward (better ilvl) people playing their spec. Yet restricting people to pay every time they respec, and pay bigger sum for it, will inevitably lead to people using alts or skipping dailies. <br />
<br />
I don't like that Blizzard wants to charge for something that has worked well as it was. Thanks to free respec and choosing loot spec, we had more people going as tank/healer to a LFG dungeon because they could still get their main dps spec loot. It is always shortage for tanks and healers. Stopping people from respecing, making them play as their main spec most of time, may make this shortage even bigger when typical dps people will decide that its better to wait 2 hours for dungeon than specing tank for it and paying 200g for the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Make it one time fee for third spec or make third spec cost at switch but don't make dual spec cost.</div></div><hr />

We are not in 2004 anymore. With the introduction of dual spec and almost free talent switch via reagents they have encouraged that people play more specs and switch on a regular basis. This did not hurt the game, because we got more part-time healers and tanks. I bet these people would think twice for going into an utility spec if this will cost them.<br />

Definitely should be some cost to swapping specs.<br />
<br />
I'd give tank/healer some leeway on it though for overall community benefit.<br />
<br />
What that cost should be - maybe like reroll tokens you should have an option of various payment methods.<br />
<br />
e.g. choice of 100g+ (increasing) or &lt;insert current currency&gt;, or a cool down per spec.<br />
<br />
But now you can be all three specs, not having a cost really dilutes the meaning of spec to 'stance' almost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ooookay so you're basically insinuating that a vanilla player should find it ok? Well, I played since launchday and I don't find it okay. I think it's a very dumb move.</div></div><hr />

As far as pure dps classes, rogue, mage, lock, and hunter having all three specs would not be needed if they balanced all the specs. All three should be equally good at AOE, single target, mobility, ect. Unfortunately they tend to make one spec better at somethings and certain specs better on certain fights. Combat rogues own on cleave fights vs an assasin rogues aoe, hence the need for multiple specs in the first place now you are going to add a cost to something that has been free since duel specs came out. I play primarily Rogue, mage, lock, or hunter I could not give a rats ass for a 3rd spec. It is all the hybrids who will benefit the most from having access to all of their specs, IMO.</div></div><hr />

WoW shouldn't either. In fact, I'd go as far to remove the current reagent cost for swapping talents and glyphs. And allow us to save sets of spec/talent/glyph/actionbar combinations (or at least allow addons to do it) for instant out-of-combat swapping.</div></div><hr />

I respec for trash. Not because it does 2k more, but because I can do 200k more. Simply speeds up the process. Will I do that if it costs 100g per switch?

<br />
Discouraging players from swapping specs will be bad for the Healer/Tank queue situation as it makes the player experience worse than the one we've had ever since secondary spec was introduced.<br />
They can't ever make all healer and tank specs be on-par with pure DPS - as nobody will play Pure DPS classes if they do.<br />
<br />
People currently use MANY specs swaps every day/week as they have 2 builds they enjoy and switch between depending on what they're doing. <br />
<br />
We paid a set amount of gold to unlock the secondary spec back in the day, set amount for third spec would be alright with me - switching between 2 specs costing gold isn't cool and feels like a limitation that shouldn't exist in the game. It limits fun you can have with your character by locking part of it 'away' even if the amount is arbitrary.<br />
<br />
As somebody else has already pointed out Healers and Tanks will suffer the most because of this change. Switching between specs has become such a central part of playing a Healer or Tank that this just doesn't add up. We'll feel like dead weight to a raid if we don't swap so we're forced to do so - far more than a pure DPS. We all know we have too many of those Healers and Tanks in the game as it is. :^)</div></div><hr />

Is the fact that they are thinking about a cost.<br />
<br />
Let me talk about how changing a talent works right now in alpha: You click a talent, you learn it. No confirmation window, no button to accept changes, no casting time or anything, no restriction because of a CD, no cost at all... click and learn, just like Diablo.<br />
<br />
I mention this because while we can assume that this is just something from alpha (although i would love if they kept it that way), it's a good example of how they don't need a placeholder at all, but even so, they added a gold cost for spec swap when i'm pretty confident that they already had the code there from dual spec without a cost.</div></div><hr />

I cant tell you how many times there have been where the healer just stands there because I can be so OP at times and they don't need to heal me. They are nerfing this relationship to where tanks are squishier and healers actually need to heal the tank. I don't know about other people but I honestly want a healer who knows how to heal me so I can keep the group alive. By making there a cost to respec they are giving people the need to learn and know their spec. I hate dual specing because if I am going to tank, its a tank. If I am going to DPS, I will just create a character specifically for DPS. Granted this respec charge can blow up in their face like garrisons did in WoD, but please stop and think before you go off the handle ranting and raving. There just might be a reason for what they are trying to do. There are millions of people playing this game. They can't please everyone.

When it's really expensive for players to swap on a per-boss basis, maybe Blizzard will stop using &quot;just swap specs&quot; as an excuse for neglecting certain specs.<br />
<br />
If it's terrible for healers or tanks to switch to a DPS spec all the time, then that forces Blizzard to make sure tanks and healers can do enough damage to quest in their tank/healer spec.<br />
<br />
And, of course, it's a great gold sink for the bleeding edge players for whom that 1% DPS increase on this fight justifies having half the raid pay 5k each.</div></div><hr />

No thanks... just keep it free please. The artifact weapons alone are enough to &quot;lock&quot; people to a spec already. A fee to respec is just unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

There's no reason for it and players shouldn't be punished for simply wanting to play a different spec. An initial payment to unlock each spec is fine, but pay 100 gold every time I want to go switch from healer to dps or vice versa? No.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From entering HFC to completion I swap specs a lot.<br />
<br />
Enter: Trash Combat &gt; Assault Combat &gt; Reaver Sub&gt; Trash Combat &gt; Kormrok Sub/Combat &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Council Sub&gt; Trash Combat &gt; Kilrogg Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Gorefiend Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Socrethar Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Iskar Combat/Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Zakuun Sub &gt; Xhul'horac Combat &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Velhari Sub &gt; Mannoroth Sub &gt; Trash Combat &gt; Archi Sub.<br />
<br />
Doing older content, and running older raids? Combat.<br />
<br />
Sticking with a single spec only is extremely silly, especially since you play a Class, not just a spec.<br />
Blizzard trying to tie people into a single spec for legion is all weird. Everything from a single artifact per spec with no ability to transmog between them, having to grind artifact power for each spec, and now adding this.<br />
<br />
You don't simply pick a spec and stick with it until the end of the expac, not when you do several things or even raid. You play what's the best for your raid and class to progress.<br />
<br />
There's absolutely no harm done to the community because you can play what's optimal, especially when you can play it all optimally. The only way Blizzard can avoid this backlash is if every DPS or HPS spec for the a class were essentially the same performance wise, and everyone knows that's not going to happen.<br />
Least you know your place. Also good job with reading comprehension.</div></div><hr />

They should make it roll you a random spec/talents each time you pay. After all, RNG is fun and exciting according to Blizz.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Todd Duval</div><div class="date">2016-01-23, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said at Blizzcon that it would cost nothing.<br />
<br />
Trust me, this wouldn't be the first time they lied at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scream And Fly</div><div class="date">2016-01-23, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The introduction of spec swap on the fly isn't meant to allow you access to do everything and be anything freely. It's meant as a QoL improvement from having to go to the trainer every time you want to swap. It has always, and should always cost something to give the specs meaning. Otherwise why not get rid of specs entirely and give all abilities to the class itself and be done with that system?<br />
<br />
What a completely absurd line of thinking. Swapping specs in the game is a very basic element to playing your character in a multitude of roles or environments. It adds to the fun of the game. Get it? The fun. So gold would give the specs more meaning? And it adds quality of life? How ridiculous. Does paying taxes on anything add to your quality of life? Swapping specs is a very basic character ability, and having to pay any gold simply to use it is dumb. What gives an ability meaning is becoming good at it and enjoying it that way, not paying some stupid gold tax every time you want to swap it.</div></div><hr />

Comprehend this: when Blizzard makes specs that are only good at clearing trash and trash-like bosses, or in some cases not even that *coughsurvivalhuntercough* it's going to be a HUGE problem if people are stuck in those specs. The artifact system is bad enough. Imagine dumping all your Artifact Power into the Survival weapon back during Highmaul and getting trolled when it turned out to be complete trash by the end of BRF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having it require a magic resource, like the Tome of the Clear Mind, or better yet require re-training in your guild hall, makes more sense. Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />
