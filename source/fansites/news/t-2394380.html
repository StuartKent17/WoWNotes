<br />
Does this mean no more reputation tokens from Missions? I'd assume we'd get rep for doing WQs anyway, so does this just override the system and give us rep for X faction for every WQ, not just certain ones? Or is it additional rep? Can they stack?<br />
<br />
I hope they aren't making rep more grindy for multi-character players is all. I liked account-wide rep tokens, especially with Paragon chests, which they seem to be carrying forward.</div></div><hr />

Definitely, and honestly for the Troll ladies who look relatively similar NBD.<br />
<br />
Don't need a troll dude DK cause daddy orc is gonna stand upright now so yay! So many blessings as a horde player this expansion. I got a tauren that looks cooler, NIGHTBORNE!! -warrior furly lady with katanas and full heritage set- a butload of zandalari hot dudes, and upright AND uncorrupted orcs.<br />

<br />
People are upset because the effort discrepancy between the horses and raptors is honestly incredible. They didn't even bother with ARMOR for the horses.<br />
<br />
If you paid attention to the first release of the horses, you may have noticed that the blue one's scant fixings, for example, were literally copy/pasted from the Cata storm drakes. I thought and hoped that that was a placeholder, but now they've made the textures vaguely higher rez, making it official: The alliance is getting piecemeal scraps from other mounts. And where they aren't copy/pastes, we get pathetic little socks in place of proper armor.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I remind you, the Horde gets elaborate gold plating. <br />
<br />
Even the Gryphons are recolors while the Horde gets the ToT mount with brand new custom armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, I like those ribbon-style reins on the storm drakes. Those are pretty rare trappings and very few mounts have them--the only other horse i know that has it is the collectors edition Seabraid Stallion.<br />
<br />
I see where you're coming from on all the work into the armored raptors, but then they're trying to really pass the aztec or undead look with that stuff, I think. I may also be wrong but I think both sides can get the mummified thing from a mythic chest or something.<br />
<br />
A gold lawn chair would be crazy looking on a horse xD<br />
<br />
I think its just been so long since we saw new gryphon/horse colors that I'm ready to see em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even the Gryphons are recolors while the Horde gets the ToT mount with brand new custom armor. So yeah, the horde gets... a pterrordax, that didn't exist in the game before, a blood tick that is an elaborate remodel of the 2 million spider and a hyena, which didn't exist in the game before. <br />
<br />
The alliance gets... 3 gryphon recolours that are barely different from the MOP Lion's Landing one and 3 horse recolours with slight armor differences but less elaborate than the collector's edition horse. <br />
<br />
So yeah.</div></div><hr />

No, it's not because it's added to the GCD. I can prove it if you want, but remember that it's added to the GCD now. It's effectively changed to a 7.5% haste buff over 12s instead of 15% over 10s</div></div><hr />
