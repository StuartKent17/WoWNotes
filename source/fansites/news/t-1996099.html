Legion - Loot Glow Effect<br />
In Legion, bosses with loot remaining on them will have a special glow to visually indicate that there is still loot on the body. This glow has also appeared in several other places during the beta (during Fishing, on some quest objects, and other NPCs) but now seems to be only on bosses. <br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I think there are 5 ways to achieve game longevity: 1) tons of content (hard!), 2) reusable content (same stuff, different rules)... (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724741759129919488))<br />
(cont.) 3) procedural content, 4) user-generated content, 5) multiplayer provides different experiences. What am I forgetting? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724741856437755904))<br />
What do you mean by procedural content?<br />
The computer makes (or mixes up ) the content, like many Roguelikes (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724957667177844736))<br />
I don't think it's necessarily one that fully qualifies, but reward structures can be a big deal for me.<br />
No, that's a good one. Content is the same, but you are motivated to still do it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724742213561806848))<br />
a good narrative!<br />
Agreed, but I'd file that under lots of content, or else you exhaust the story too quickly. And it's hard. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724742383418531840))<br />
Speedruns/achievements maybe?<br />
I meant speedruns under mods, kind of like difficulty adjustments or Halo skulls. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724747158285471744))<br />
<br />
&quot;Make your peace with a finite game.&quot; I think it's ok to have stories end.<br />
I agree. I wish more games did this and didn't try to be the only game I ever need. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/724768564025008128))<br />

Seems unlikely that Illidan consumed the powers of the skull of Gul'dan 10,000 before Gul'dan opened the portal to Azeroth...</div></div><hr />

<br />
lllidan got demonized when he absorbed the power of Gul'dan's skull in Warcraft 3. Before that he was a regular Nelf jailed fo 10,000 years. Medivh's avatar of sargeras stuff happened much before Warcraft 3. Hence long before is pretty accurate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having a donation option doesnt mean that he will hide the product behind a pay2use system. If DBM is still free2use, Blizzard won't do a thing. If he has a donation button somewhere on his addon site, Blizzard won't mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To correct you both, blizzard does not care about money made from add ons outside the game but they will ban code that has an in game donate button. And the author is putting the money in his pocket for living expenses so that he can focus on the add on and not have a &quot;normal&quot; job. He puts more time into his add on that what he would make doing a normal coding job but he has the advantage of staying at home as he mentions that he is a caregiver for a family member. <br />
<br />
TLDR you should both learn to read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do make money but I'm not getting wealthy by any means. I work on mod full time now. have for a while now. Development was just supported by elitist jerks (until it basically died). I do put money back into the mod as much as possible as well. I still plan to depending on patreon support.<br />
<br />
Read the full post for the full context, MMOC only showed a small snippet.<br />
http://www.deadlybossmods.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=21<br />
<br />
It also covers the rules on addon development and advertising or soliciting for donations. DBM respects these rules.<br />
<br />
In fact MANY addon authors make some money for their work. Not all as much as DBM, but many aren't as big of a project as DBM either (managed by a team of 1 no less). More time goes into them than you realize. Especially the time I've put into dbm the last 3-4 years. I've basically overhauled the mod. Have even more surprises in store for legion.<br />
<br />
I don't ask anyone to support that doesn't want to, nor will there be any &quot;gating&quot; of any kind.<br />
<br />
I was actually shocked to see this make MMOC front page (I definitely appreciate it though!). To be honest I actually hate asking for support. Most of DBMs campaigning has actually been it's amazing users. I keep hoping to win the lottery so I can do big give aways instead of asking for support. Alas, my lucky number has not come up yet. :( So for now, support is what I need to keep working on it full time and bring more amazing surprises for legion.<br />
<br /> Baneleaf Yeah pretty much. I do this for my mother more than anything. Working on DBM full time has made life so much easier for her with having me around and nearby all the time. When I was working 40 hours a week doing security with 10 hours added driving too and from, it was hard on us both. On top of that, DBM was lackluster at best with what little time I could put into it during late wrath/early cataclysm. even my own raiders didn't use my mods at that time. Going full time on DBM allowed me to make mod much better and be where I was needed. My goal now is to continue doing that, while making DBM better and better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but the moment he offers features only available to people who play, they will ban his mod because mods of wow have to be freeware.<br />
You are only allowed to get free donations outside the mod. That's all.</div></div><hr />

And the author is putting the money in his pocket for living expenses so that he can focus on the add on and not have a &quot;normal&quot; job. He puts more time into his add on that what he would make doing a normal coding job but he has the advantage of staying at home as he mentions that he is a caregiver for a family member. <br />
<br />
TLDR you should both learn to read.<br />
<br />
He is working on DBM fulltime, for that he has to eat, shower and have running water - for me those living expenses are part of the job he does working on DBM, not like he goes out and buys fancy cars with the money. (he even says in the full article that he lives on the bare minimum)<br />
<br />
<br />
I do make money but I'm not getting wealthy by any means. I work on mod full time now. have for a while now. Development was just supported by elitist jerks (until it basically died). I do put money back into the mod as much as possible as well. I still plan to depending on patreon support.<br />
<br />
See my point above.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, but the moment he offers features only available to people who play, they will ban his mod because mods of wow have to be freeware.<br />
You are only allowed to get free donations outside the mod. That's all.<br />
<br />
Yeah, since that is part of the Mod TOS, but he isn't offering any &quot;pay only&quot; features, so who cares?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The DBM author is aware of and complying with the rules Blizz established. There won't be a problem from them. He may not get enough Patreon supporters though--that could force him to put working on it at a lower priority than whatever the alt income source becomes. Personally, i'll donate to help prevent that from being necessary. Its been a must-have since early TBC for me.</div></div><hr />

Why just dbm then? Are you going to open your wallet to every addon you've been using for more than XX amount of time? If thats the case its gonna be more like buying 10-20 pizzas for random strangers a year. And then doesnt that make you feel sorry for the addons that were only used for a single tier like Iskar Assist? Doesnt that guy deserve a dollar per raider also? <br />

i was keeping a addon for almost 2 expansions that many people loved and taken alot of my time for it and i received $0<br />

We addon authors usually do stuff for us in the beginning and we share it but after some time it becomes almost our job (bug tracking, bug fixing, implement functions that people want, etc etc) and many time we dont even need to do it, worse when there is a major bug and we addon authors dont have the time to fix it (real life) and so many people complaining and offending sometimes<br />

A single addon for one specific feature/boss/expansion is a start for a addon author to get recognised, but not enough to pay money for. But dbm has major support many years now. I think it's fair to give some back. Not every addon gets so much support and is so important for raiders over such a long time. There are other addons like let's say Skada or Bartender (or for me Altoholic) that also deserve a small donation. Just anything you use for a very long time and helps you very much. It's a nice way to say thank you. Most addons are nice but many did similar ones and the support often stops with the next expansion. Those I mentioned are different.</div></div><hr />

It IS free. If you don't want to donate, no one says you have to. But when he runs out of money, gets a new job, and doesn't have time to make DBM anymore, maybe then you'll at least understand why he was asking for a monthly donation. <br />
<br />
What you need to comprehend is that he's not asking for money to use his product. He's asking for money for the time he spends creating and servicing that product. <br />

<br />
Let alone you proved why it isn't Illidan in the first sentence. Illidan didn't become demonic until he absorbed the power of Gul'dan's skull. Kind of hard for him to do that, while ya know, Gul'dan is still alive in the movie.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;hate&quot;, as you put it, was not so much about asking for donations but for Tiny placing the beer (donation by another label) button in-game. Now if he wanted to tango with Blizzard on it, that was his own choice, but Curse refused to be a party to it.</div></div><hr />

Problem is, there is a serious competetor out there, BigWigs. Which for me works close to, or better than DBM depending on the fight. I like the idea of a Patreon for an succesfull author. But it's mostly a small step towards paywall.<br />

There has been a form of boss mods even before DBM was around in Vanilla. The fights were far less complex and relied heavily on dispelling abilities and CC. It was just a simpler form of encounter. With DBM, Blizzard was able to use the fact that add-on's like this existed to create the more complex content we see today.</div></div><hr />

Progression comes in the form of the &quot;pvp talents&quot;. You have a seperate pvp exp bar that unlocks talents as you rank up. After you've reached max rank, you can hit the Prestige button, reset your pvp level back to one, and start over again. Prestige-ing has it's own rewards tied into it, mounts, artifact weapon designs (and colors) and such. If you want to just pvp and level all the way up and stay there, that's fine too.</div></div><hr />
