<meta name="description" content="Sound Blaster Teaser Day 2 - Just a Headset 
I can't really say I'm surprised, the teaser on Sound Blaster's Website has been updated and it turns out that it's nothing more than a new World of Warcraft wireless headset. More details will be released during the Blizzcon.

You won't be using it during raids because it doesn't have a mic. Don't see the point imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Usually &quot;headset&quot; implies microphone... and &quot;headphones&quot; implies no mic. I bet it will have a mic. It would be totally ridiculous not to.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I bet it will be similar to their other wireless headset:<br />

Well.. &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;over priced gear&quot;, I don't see how you could have the first without the second... would be nice if this also included &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;compatibility&quot;, too sad this is no longer the case</div></div><hr />

Because believe it or not, good marketing teams research their target base and know how to stir them up into a consumer frenzy. I guarantee after all the hits from mmo, the marketing team at SoundBlaster got what will now be known to marketing teams in every company as the &quot;Blizzcon Hype Bonus&quot;.</div></div><hr />

if you didnÂ´t recognized that after 5 years, then its your own fault.<br />

I thought about headsets since the morning (since the &quot;teaser-site&quot; was postet by an german wow-fansite) that it could only be a headset or something like that (the technical circle around the horde logo looks like a headset).<br />
<br />
blizzard plays with you since 5 years, they can do everything with you, and you let this pass - so its your fault.<br />

The Maelstrom is on existing maps. It's smack-bang in the middle of the two continents. The headset was positioned in the &quot;middle&quot; of the map, ergo overlapping the Maelstrom.<br />

Actually... that's was the initial design. You could actually buy VCRs and stuff with a wired remote going to them (cord went across the room to the couch or whatever). Once wireless hit the market those disappeared fast.</div></div><hr />

Lots of negative posts in this thread but so many fail to realize that there are only a handful of wireless gaming headsets in existence, none of which are impressive in any way. If they've gone as far as marketing it with WoW they must have confidence that the product is ground-breaking, which honestly wouldn't take much. If the sound and mic quality are solid, it has noise-cancelling headphones that are actually big enough to cover the average person's ear, and has a charging base, then it is pure win.</div></div><hr />

Especially since that picture synched up to that map of Azeroth near COMPLETELY. Oh wait. That's the fucking point. It was just a fucking logo super-imposed on top of a screen cap of the world map. Blizzard was not going to release any details of an upcoming expansion through a partner like Creative, it was just some hardware tie-in. Who woulda' thought? Oh wait again; JUST ABOUT EVERY LEVEL-HEADED MOTHER FUCKING IN THE WORLD KNEW THIS. The fact that you posted that yesterday as SERIOUS NEWS, fueling rumors of expansion details, is just ludicrous. And not to mention, this is in addition to the ABSOLUTELY COW-FUCKINGLY INSANE list of bullshit rumors you've pulled out of your ass and labeled as &quot;leaked info&quot; regarding some expansion fan-porn. The fact that so many people look at this website, and WoWInsider too, as sources are factual information is just MIND BOGGLING. STOP YOUR FUCKING GUESS WORK. REPORT FACTS, OR REPORT NOTHING. I was under the impression that this was a legitimate website containing news related to a video game, not your fucking blog where you post all your wet dreams about it. Fuck you. Fuck your stupid website. Fuck all your retarded little ideas. Eat a dick in hell.</div></div><hr />

Especially since that picture synched up to that map of Azeroth near COMPLETELY. Oh wait. That's the fucking point. It was just a fucking logo super-imposed on top of a screen cap of the world map. Blizzard was not going to release any details of an upcoming expansion through a partner like Creative, it was just some hardware tie-in. Who woulda' thought? Oh wait again; JUST ABOUT EVERY LEVEL-HEADED MOTHER FUCKING IN THE WORLD KNEW THIS. The fact that you posted that yesterday as SERIOUS NEWS, fueling rumors of expansion details, is just ludicrous. And not to mention, this is in addition to the ABSOLUTELY COW-FUCKINGLY INSANE list of bullshit rumors you've pulled out of your ass and labeled as &quot;leaked info&quot; regarding some expansion fan-porn. The fact that so many people look at this website, and WoWInsider too, as sources are factual information is just MIND BOGGLING. STOP YOUR FUCKING GUESS WORK. REPORT FACTS, OR REPORT NOTHING. I was under the impression that this was a legitimate website containing news related to a video game, not your fucking blog where you post all your wet dreams about it. Fuck you. Fuck your stupid website. Fuck all your retarded little ideas. Eat a dick in hell. <br />
<br />
LOL!!! The last time I saw a display like that was at a store when some little kid with snot running out of his nose threw a fit because his mom wouldn't buy him some toy.<br />
<br />
It's even funnier because posters like this guy thrive on skipping lines in Boubouilles posts like &quot;I don't think Blizzard would announce anything important through another site and it's most likely just a nice way to release a new piece of hardware but we'll keep an eye on it anyway.&quot; Sounds like someone either forgot to take their medication... or they're in desperate need of being prescribed some.</div></div><hr />

I was the one speculating more about how this wasn't just a headset, and I'm NOT gonna hide in a hole just because you say crap like that. I was wrong, big freaking whoop, world keeps turning....</div></div><hr />

Just look at the whole Mountain Dew thing with the pet. How much of that crap did you buy/swallow?<br />
<br />
89$ headset with WoW logo or 15$ one that works just as well...</div></div><hr />
