Nothing worthwhile from that short chain anyway, so I won't be bothering with LFR on any of my alts.</div></div><hr />

Not only that it also pulls random mobs around were it spawns, its buggy and annoying as hell especially in small areas or places of high mob numbers it always puts you in combat with mobs you didn't want. IMO there should be a way to turn these Follower skills off or not passive like pet skills, just bad design with very little thought and testing......as usual<br />
<br />
On a whole personally patch brought nothing but more issues, overhyped content patch which is seriously underwhelming.</div></div><hr />
