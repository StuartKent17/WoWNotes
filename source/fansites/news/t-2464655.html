With scheduled maintenance this week, we’re going to make some adjustments to several specs in PvE and PvP, as well as a number of Azerite Traits. We’re keeping a close eye on both early performance in the new raid as well as how things have been going in Mythic Keystone dungeons in Tides of Vengeance.<br />

Developers’ note: Marksmanship damage has been a bit too low when not using Unerring Vision. With the reduction to Unerring Vision’s effectiveness, this increase brings Marksmanship up to a more appropriate overall level.<br />

Based on data observed since Tides of Vengeance launched, we have a number of tuning changes for Azerite traits. The goal of these changes is to improve the usability of some class traits, as well as rein in the power of some of the newer traits in a way that still preserves their core coolness. Additionally, some Azerite traits changed value dramatically with changes to specs in Tides of Vengeance, so we’re taking this opportunity to rebalance those traits as the Mythic Raid opens.<br />

You would think they would at least wait to see a couple of weeks of Heroic Logs and Mythic Logs then put on a blindfold and throw darts. But hey I play a Guardian Druid so at this point I expect.. .well hell I don't expect anything positive.</div></div><hr />

Ridiculous, when I was so close to get my third wildfire trait and finally leave frost behind, it's the blaster shit show all over again. And how bad were those Arcane traits for them to buff the damage by 200%!? The mana reduction is still aweful. 190 mana on a 10k mana cost spell. Hurray!<br />
<br />
Not sure if Arcane Pummeling buff will be of any help in pvp with the base 50% effective nerf. We all know how useful it is in PVE...</div></div><hr />

How can you get something so wrong you have to buff it by 200%?<br />

I was thinking the same thing. Mana reduction is still horrible tho. Would need to see some sims if it is worth staying above 70% mana with 3 of these.</div></div><hr />

The lack of PTR may explain that, they had absolutely no possibility to know how ineffective it was. <br />
<br />
Nerfs/Buffs by more than 10% should never happen imo if they were competent. Anything that goes beyond 33% (on Live of course, it makes sense on PTR) show that they are the worst developers ever.</div></div><hr />

The goal of these changes is to improve the usability of some class traits, as well as rein in the power of some of the newer traits in a way that still preserves their core coolness. Additionally, some Azerite traits changed value dramatically with changes to specs in Tides of Vengeance, so we’re taking this opportunity to rebalance those traits as the Mythic Raid opens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cute. <br />
Its the first major patch of the expansion, we are 168 days in to BFA, and we are still seeing &quot;slight&quot; changes within the 40-150% range.<br />
Call me a hater, but this is a complete garbage system. You have a build, organized around certain azerite traits? -no problem, lets just nerf them by 900% and buff the next trait.<br />
Is this fun? Is this what blizzard thinks entertainment is? <br />
I can call a design flawed by looking the &quot;tuning&quot; the developers are implementing. If its something within the range of 5%~, its ok, we can call it tuning.<br />
150% is not tuning and its clearly not working well.</div></div><hr />

If the tier consisted of heavy movement and pure ST specs such as shadow, destro and balance would fall behind. There aren't any good solutions to this problem that i am aware of, some examples:<br />
<br />
-Remove niches, every spec is capable of great ST, Stacked AoE and spread cleave.<br />
-Tune specs only with the current tier in mind.<br />
-Design raids so every niche gets equal amounts of spotlight.<br />
<br />
Even with these issues the balance isn't to far off, it's pretty much just like legion which was praised for its class balance compared to earlier expansions. (Just look at the statistics for WoD raids).<br />
<br />
*Some specs are perhaps capable of too much. For example aff locks and shadow priests have great ST which just gets amplified when additional targets are added to an encounter. Shadows output is greater but aff is less affected by movement.</div></div><hr />

It also makes sense. They are focusing on costs cut, fact. They made BfA without sets, and sets are cloth,leather,mail transmog... only. This expansion is the product of costs cut, and even if they don't look at bloodmallet, they sure seem to have the same system when &quot;tuning&quot;. Seems they made their secretary do the heavy lifting of putting the values in. <br />
<br />
I just hope that this is indeed a filler expansion, and the next one will be awesome again. I liked legion, not at start with legendaries, but it was still fun to get them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on how many chaos bolts you get out during infernal. Your first couple of chaos bolts will do more dmg but the ones at the end of your infernal will do less. Here's a chart showing the difference. For simplicity say chaos bolt did 1000 dmg before the patch.<br />

So let's instead just look at the fights you deem relevant then, huh?

How can you get something so wrong you have to buff it by 200%?<br />
<br />
<br />
ikr even bofore the trait came out it was clear how bad it is in comparison to galvanizing spark. The dmg is less and only above 70% mana. And if you jump from 2 to 4 charges thanks to your GS trait and rule of three you save more than 10.000 mana. in comparison to that you have 190 saved mana per cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to sound like I'm just defending them in general (there has been an undeniable slide in overall quality the past couple/few years), but on this one point - they don't just balance for end-game raiding / pvp. If, for example, leveling traits (or fresh 120 dungeon traits, whatever) are very out of whack that's fair game for adjustment as well.</div></div><hr />

1: This is week 1, almost nobody is doing &quot;ranking strats&quot; where guilds &quot;lay off quick add killing&quot;. The vast majority of logs are progression / PUGs, only the biggest guilds can affort cheese strats already. Also, Heroic is really not undertuned right now (not difficult, but not undertuned)<br />

2: Here are the stats for Grong, a pure single-target fight (dont talk about the adds or you're not even being serious at this point)<br />

Can you, O wise player that you are, see a pattern here ? Destro / SP / Boomkin / Aff on top, and none of them are nerfed ? Fire Mage scraping the bottom of the barrel, yet receiving a 30% nerf on the only good Azerite trait ?<br />
<br />
Remove your blizzard fanboy glasses and use your brain for more than 10s. These changes are absurd.<br />
<br />
Any change bigger than 10% is not balance, it's bad game design Let's not even talk about that 200% madness. Blizzard are out of touch, using irrelevant data to &quot;balance&quot; their class, and not actual player data.</div></div><hr />

Just FYI (not arguing either side here), you can actually show boss-only damage on WCL to find pure ST damage. Obviously adds sometimes increase proccs and resources for multi-DoT class so be wary of that. So using the example you used, it would become: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/21#metric=bossdps&amp;difficulty=4&amp;dataset=80&amp;boss=2263<br />

You do realize that they nerfed the main culprit of destro’s burst damage by half, right? That 15% buff is just to compensate the normal chaos bolts that don’t hit for much without stacking cooldowns and procs.<br />
<br />
They should treat all classes like this by removing their reliance on damage on big cooldowns. This is the major failure of this expansion. Classes hitting shitty until they pop their big cd’s - decent sustained damage is just gone.</div></div><hr />

That has sadly been a development for a long time now.<br />
Every class / spec needs a CD for the sake of having a CD, same goes for defensive, being *just* tanky via passives / more HP is mostly gone, everyone has the same copycat shield wall / immunity.<br />

It's not good how stackable Unerring Vision was, but flat 5% damage increase or, better, bigger buffs to Focus Fire and In The Rhythm needed, because even after -33% they are still second tier choice dps wise and clash with both viable builds. Or rework Steady Aim into something that have any application in current mm, this trait is a leftover from previous MM iteration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1: This is week 1, almost nobody is doing &quot;ranking strats&quot; where guilds &quot;lay off quick add killing&quot;. The vast majority of logs are progression / PUGs, only the biggest guilds can affort cheese strats already. Also, Heroic is really not undertuned right now (not difficult, but not undertuned)<br />
<br />
2: Here are the stats for Grong, a pure single-target fight (dont talk about the adds or you're not even being serious at this point)<br />

Can you, O wise player that you are, see a pattern here ? Destro / SP / Boomkin / Aff on top, and none of them are nerfed ? Fire Mage scraping the bottom of the barrel, yet receiving a 30% nerf on the only good Azerite trait ?<br />
<br />
Remove your blizzard fanboy glasses and use your brain for more than 10s. These changes are absurd.<br />
<br />
Any change bigger than 10% is not balance, it's bad game design Let's not even talk about that 200% madness. Blizzard are out of touch, using irrelevant data to &quot;balance&quot; their class, and not actual player data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya don't even talk about those adds on your single target fight, I mean the top s-priest log only a 1/3rd of his damage or more is on the add....feeding his rotation into the boss<br />
<br />
<br />
5.9m on boss<br />
1.05m on 1st add<br />
690k on 2nd<br />
etc etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
No one said some of the top classes don't need a nerf btw, I was commenting on using the wrong information to cry for them its almost as bad as bitching that blizzard is using X when no one knows what blizzard uses to balance classes even after 15+ years.</div></div><hr />

The top and bottom outliers are only about 6% off the average in those statistics, which is pretty well balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overall good changes i must say!<br />
<br />
And nothing but a bugfix (nobody takes Fires of Justice and DP isn't the talent of choice in many cases) to compensate for it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boo Radley</div><div class="date">2019-01-30, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Co-author of the hunter Steady Shot macro checking in. One of the top EJ posting hunters from TBC to Early Cata. Was just as bad if not worse with Ghostcrawler.<br />
<br />
This set of changes is bad and should be reverted. Most of the rest of the balance items have been pretty good in BFA. Damage is more balanced than it ever was with Ghostcrawler.<br />
<br />
Hang on now, this is a very biased statement. The GC era had 3 different factors that are very important to remember:<br />
1. The game was relatively new and they hadnt learned all the lessons yet. It doesnt excuse all of the errors they made but it should be considered.<br />
2. Innovation was important to the devs, mechanics were regarded as the core of the game and GC was a mechanics focused dev (unlike the current lead who clearly doesnt give a shit about them). New mechanics came out all the time and were expected. I cannot remember a single xpac with GC that didnt have something very cool and flashy for each class/spec. Even if they werent that cool to some, as that's subjective and I cant speak for everyone, it changed your gameplay without fail. New buttons werent regarded with fear. Feeling more powerful now than you did then was the norm. Character progression existed. <br />
3. Player skill was still valued and encouraged. Damage is more balanced now both between and within each class, the former being probably a good thing but the latter a horrible thing, because they took out all the ways for the best players to get more out of the toolkit. The toolkits shrank, the abilities that stayed did less, interactivity died and the skill ceiling was crushed down to no longer exist. &quot;World of soakcraft&quot; became the only way for devs to make challenging mechanics, as doing the damage itself could no longer constitute anything remotely challenging.<br />
<br />
I mean, congrats on your macro writing but if you're touting being a &quot;hotshot&quot; from the same place that gave birth to Watcher and his mindset about the game, that's not something that makes people like your point of view. I dont really care that damage is all the same, actually I really hate it that all classes sucking is the way they chose to balance it. If they made all classes do 20 million dps but you needed 15 fingers to possibly do it, that would be better than everyone doing 15 million on a one button macro (like your claim to fame, which I remember actually arose from a fault being found within the interplay between mechanics, not by the intended core design as it is now) and claiming its &quot;better for the game.&quot; I'm not trying to deride you but man I just cannot agree with the idea that &quot;taking chances and making mistakes is better than not doing anything interesting at all because at least its balanced.&quot; <br />
<br />
Edit: I came back and fleshed out my commentary a little.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SinR</div><div class="date">2019-01-30, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Against Overwhelming Odds quest is only offered to a faction when they have recently been severely outnumbered, with a War Mode bonus of 20% or more. This week, Alliance players have a 15% War Mode bonus in the American region.<br />
<br />
And it will be 30% next week. But there's no point because it awards a piece of Normal Gear now.<br />
<br />
Horde will be back to camping the Flight Paths and Turtle Dailies, just like Alliance did last week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why blizz havent made landing at flight paths and exiting turtle quests come with a 30 second invulnerability buff and equal duration silence/disarm debuff so you can choose to hearth out or mount up and run the other way, but cant attack, assist or be attacked is just sad. There's a difference between world pvp and jumping people to farm kills, and if they wanted to support one they'd help stop the abusive behavior that turns people away from it. Its the same thing as invulnerability frames in other games, to make sure enemies cant abuse mechanics to hit you during periods where you dont have control. As long as it provides no advantage to one side or the other I really dont see how its a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Or you know, put in more graveyards so the game wasnt so fucking painful to run back to your corpse in. <br />
<br />
Inb4 &quot;you can just turn off warmode&quot; because I did. Despite PvP being practically the only endgame content I enjoy, warmode was too exploitative.</div></div><hr />
