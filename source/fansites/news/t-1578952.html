Warlords of Draenor - Alliance and Horde Choppers<br />
The latest beta build added the chopper mount models, so we are taking a look at them today. Keep in mind that this is beta and &lt;span title=&quot;Especially those hand and feet positions&quot;&gt;nothing here is final&lt;/span&gt;!<br />

FEEDBACK: Highmaul - Walled City (LFR)<br />
This first wing of LFR Highmaul is open for the weekend! <br />
We've opened the first wing of Highmaul Raid Finder (Kargath, Butcher, and Brackenspore) for the weekend. It's quite likely that these encounters are overtuned for the intended audience, but we'll be watching closely to make the required tweaks to get the experience to where it needs to be. In general, Raid Finder should be no more challenging than it was in Mists, so please tailor your feedback regarding tuning accordingly.<br />
<br />

Warlords Currency Changes<br />
Honor and Conquest definitely are not going away, just to clarify a misconception - you'll still be earning those currencies through PvP and using them to buy your PvP gear.<br />
<br />
What will be going away is Justice and Valor. Over time, they've moved away from their original purpose, and given how widely available they'd become (awarded from quests, scenarios, dungeons, raids, etc.), we'd rather return to the original universal currency: gold. The final values aren't hooked up yet, but the old Valor rewards for completing your daily random dungeon or an LFR wing will be replaced with a hefty sum of gold, which should make something like the gold turn-in for a bonus roll seem far more attainable even for players who currently don't have much gold.<br />
<br />
That said, the feedback/suggestion of allowing repeat turn-ins definitely has merit, and it's something we'll discuss and consider. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/333951-seal-of-tempered-fate-acquisition/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13923582306?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
Importance of Garrisons<br />
Do you think Blizzard is putting too much emphasis on garrisons? Feels like they're heavily tied in with leveling and overall game play to the point you simple cant not do them. I feel Blizzard would do so much better just focusing on epic raids and heaps of dungeons, that's our bread and butter. Trying to reinvent the wheel every expansion will always bring about hits and misses.<br />
We're putting together (at long last) more information on the Garrisons that will hopefully assuage a lot of concerns people have and share more about the gameplay that goes with it. It will take us a little longer to put that information together for you all, but I think it will shed some light on the depth of Garrisons while also making it clear how much or how little you can interact with them (based on what you want from it). They definitely have something to offer pretty much everyone (save the rare person).<br />
<br />
We'll do our best to try to address as many concerns and questions as people have in those blogs and in the forums here as we go along.<br />
<br />
Finally! It has been nearly three months since part one of the supposed four-part water cooler on Garrisons. I figured it was because they've gone through heavy iteration.<br />
It's a great addition to the game and yes, it's gone through a lot of iteration (for the better) that we hope everyone will be able to enjoy. We just didn't want to put out blogs that weren't as accurate as possible since it is such a big addition. We wanted to do it some justice (and the developers too) when we presented it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/333840-too-much-emphasis-on-garrisons/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13922802339?page=2#32))<br />

Read Hellscream, the prelude to Warlords of Draenor<br />
&quot;We will never be slaves! But we will be conquerorsâ€¦&quot;<br />
<br />
The pit lord Mannoroth is dead.<br />
<br />
Gul'dan and his followers are in chains.<br />
<br />
In one night, Grommash Hellscream exposed and thwarted the forces that meant to subjugate the orcs. In one night, Hellscream proved himself a worthy warchief to the Iron Horde and set his people on a violent collision course with another world in another time.<br />
<br />
But this was not meant to be. Who warned Hellscream of Gul'dan's treachery? Who convinced him that Azeroth was a foe worth defeating at all costs?<br />
<br />
Before Gul'dan's dramatic fall, two strangers arrived on Draenor: Garrosh Hellscream, the deposed warchief of the Horde on Azeroth, and Kairozdormu, a bronze dragon whose motivations were clouded in mystery. The newest World of Warcraft short story, &quot;Hellscream,&quot; (http://battle.net/wow/game/lore/savage-world/hellscream/) reveals how their actions on Draenor have placed all living beings on Azeroth in mortal peril. Read the short story here, and then delve deeper into the events surrounding the Iron Horde invasion in our lore archives:<br />
<br />
<br />
War Crimes (http://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Crimes-Christie-Golden/dp/1451684487) - In this novel by Christie Golden, Garrosh Hellscream is put on trial for his crimes during the events of Mists of Pandaria.<br />
Gul'dan and the Stranger (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/Z5EDRREGHRLM1406310705908.pdf) - Gul'dan and Garrosh Hellscream meet face to face for the first time in this free comic written by Micky Neilson, featuring art by Alex Horley.<br />
World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor cinematic (http://battle.net/wow/warlords-of-draenor/?autoplay=cinematic) - At a pivotal moment in Draenor's history, Warsong chieftain Grommash Hellscream challenges destiny and reforges the fate of his people.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Hopefully this question makes sense: Does Haste affect the resource regeneration of multiple classes in some uniform fashion?<br />
Yes. It's completely uniform. 1% is 1%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499739222585004032))<br />
Being able to adjust that number might very well solve many problems. I see no downside here. Am I missing something?<br />
The &quot;rate haste affects resource gen&quot; isn't an arbitrary thing. 1% is 1%. That's what haste is. It'd be bizarre otherwise. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499747937476296704))<br />

so why do mages with timewarp get a healing cd as well. Rough call there, sorry.<br />
Time Warp is a raid buff, not stackable raid utility. Same as Crit buff or Mastery buff, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499936635208105985))<br />

Prior to healing tuning, can we get confirmation on Chi Explosion and Breath of the Serpent splitting?<br />
Both are currently intended to split, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499743960378527747))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
I'm sure everyone knows how ANNOYING it is to try and get raids together during the holidays.<br />
Yes, we do. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/499985981823406081))<br />
<br />
I cant imagine rushing through #Warlords to do molten core at 100.<br />
.Anniversary content will be open for a while, don't rush through Warlords! Lots to see! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/499970676006993920))<br />
<br />
Sorry if I missed it but will level 90 UBRS be tuned for fresh 90s or will it be tuned for players who have a decent item level?<br />
For existing 90s who've done at least some Timeless Isle, Siege LFR, etc. New 90s will find rewarding content in Blasted Lands. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500034607639572480))<br />
<br />
Grom is the final boss of WoD? Please don't let this be true. SOO 2.0 <br />
There's a lot of ground and a lot of story to cover before the book closes on Warlords. Trust me, it won't feel like SoO 2.0. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500052144917970944))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Skirmishes might be better if they'd take player skill into account (like an MMR?), or you feel randomness is part of the flavour?<br />
You have a skirmish MMR, its just hidden. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499985036074971136))<br />
<br />
So, will the TM vs SS be level 100 or level 90? The release date being so close to the anniversary makes it confusing.<br />
We'll have a bunch of different brackets for the anniversary battleground (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/499985408516575232))<br />
<br />
World<br />
I'll say it. I'm sick of Orcs.<br />
That's feedback that we are very conscious of, and are taking big steps to make sure it doesn't end up being the case. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499979975999496193))<br />
There are a ton of different races and creatures in Draenor. Lots to fight besides Orcs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/499980396743102464))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Are the dates for the 10th Anniversary on the in-game calendar correct? 4 days to level to 100 to get into the LFR?<br />
The dates are not correct. That is a recurring calendar event that was set up a while back. This year's will be different. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/499985923761651712))<br />
<br />
Good to hear. Release date on a Thursday seems unusual though, lockout-reset day changing to Thursday or just a one time thing?<br />
Expansion releases haven't always been Tues - no general change to lockout timing (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/499996619941494785))<br />
does this give you the ability to patch on Tues/Wed, and unlock midnight Thursday without a patch on release date?<br />
we generally do not patch at all during the week of an expansion release - you'll have all the data needed in 6.0 (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500000253609656320))<br />

<br />
&quot; the old Valor rewards for completing your daily random dungeon or an LFR wing will be replaced with a hefty sum of gold, which should make something like the gold turn-in for a bonus roll seem far more attainable even for players who currently don't have much gold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which makes even less sense, because the currency for my (warforged seals for) bonus rolls were 50 Lesser charms (and never gold)<br />

So what if the cinematic featured a lot of orcs? They're not horde - they're villains. If that's your argument, did you then also argue that Wrath cinematic was &quot;Too alliance focused&quot;? Arthas used to be part of the alliance and a paladin - but he turned bad - and became a villain. Just like Garrosh. Get over it. If you honestly think we'll be fighting 90% orcs this expansion I don't know what can be done for you.</div></div><hr />

Obviously that's not the final way people will look on the bikes.. if you truly played for as long as you're preaching you'd know this. Also why do you deserve a special reward for playing since vanilla? People that started in BC deserve less? Wotlk people too? Fact is, it doesn't matter how long you're playing the game and you really don't deserve anything special for it since the fact you've been able to enjoy the game for such a long time is a reward on it's own... How many people wish they played back then and never be able to experience it.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm sure there's plenty of people that like bikes and stuff but I personally would've preferred a somewhat different kind of mount. Maybe something along the lines of being able to use on water and land since we can't fly in Draenor.</div></div><hr />

Also the way that the characters sit on the mechanohog and alliance equivalent are modified to look different than the standard way of mounting.

If you had actual paid attention (which you partly have since you've seen the RL bikes, so I don't know why you haven't looked further than that), you'd know the Horde one is free and the Alliance one will set you back by a hundred grand.</div></div><hr />

Because I haven't played WoW for over a year, but I still follow it on occasion and have friends that still play. I stand by my comment they are ugly as sin, hideous enough I felt the need to comment about them (yes, I realize this is a WoW news site... they also have Diablo news on occasion and forums about other games/things ;p). Sorry if posts from a non-current WoW player offends anyone...<br />

Overall, the quality of mounts has only gone downhill IMHO. There are a few amazing ones each xpac but that's about it (Raven, Plagued Proto, Flametalon, Mimiron's Head, Celestial/Sha mounts probably a few others - I don't exactly have access to my collection at the moment or care enough to look them up on armory/wow-head). They seem rather torn about what they can sell for $$$ and what should be a reward for playing. For me the only reason I played WoW for as long as I did, in the end, was my mount collection... to see them put garbage like these mounts in game saddens me, but it only reaffirms why I quit; quantity over quality (and there isn't even that much quantity any more judging from the year long SoO raid).</div></div><hr />

Shape wise they are true to the real life ones... But the textures on them are kind of weak sauce. Needs moar of a polished shine on the alliance, and on the Horde one, it looks like they embelished on the real life version's tusks... NO. BAD BLIZZARD. In fact the whole Hordebike looks poorly interpreted from the real life version.</div></div><hr />

Defiantly not Blizzard quality. If you cant make it blizzard quality due to restrictions then don't put it in simple.</div></div><hr />

They just turned to shit when blizzard broke their leg about trying to somehow re-purpose them since wannabe-pro-gamers couldn't stand that the cheapest, most useless version of the tier-sets could be acquired by casual-gamers as well. Tho, in MoP the points have been 100% useless since the gear you could purchase at any point was so horrible that it wasn't worth buying even if all your alts had where a bunch of blues. The only exception where the parts from Throne of Thunder... which to me were very useless since even my most neglected alt got his gear by random-by-chance raids then it would have took to collect all the points since getting them these days is nothing but a chore. Mind that i didn't want them to be easy to get, but around 130 points a day if you need 1500 for once piece is just like giving you a finger.</div></div><hr />

How is it giving you the middle finger? The current VP rate means you're getting new gear at about the same speed as somebody running normal/heroic raids.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard turned to crap when they started the cater for special snowfakes imo. Most players want to be the best, creating heroic modes puts most players out of reach of that. Make the game dumber and more easy for most players and your loose a couple but keep / gain many more.</div></div><hr />
