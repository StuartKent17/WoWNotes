Patch 4.3: Jewelcrafting Changes<br />
Jewelcrafting received some pricing adjustments on the PTR, mostly dealing with uncut gems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uncut Cataclysm uncommon, rare, and meta gems can no longer be sold to the vendor. <br />
Cut uncommon gems sell for more to the vendor and cost more to list on the Auction House.<br />
Uncut Cataclysm gems cost &lt;span class=&quot;price&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;price-hidden&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to list on the Auction House for 48 hours.<br />

<br />
Dragon Soul<br />
Thrall<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_DWBATTLE_01 - Aspects! Aid the heroes as best you can.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_DWBATTLE_02 - These champions are our only hope for exposing Deathwing's weakness. Together, we can prevail.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_DWBATTLE_03 - Don't give up! We're counting on you to push Deathwing back.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_IRIS_01 - Heroes! This burden falls to you, once again.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_IRIS_02 - You must protect us from Deathwing's forces while we imbue the Dragon Soul with the power of the aspects.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_IRIS_03 - Speak to me when you are ready to begin.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_MAELSTROMSLAY_01 - It is done. At last, the destroyer has met his end. Now, we can begin to heal our world.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_MAELSTROM_01 - Strike now, heroes! Only you can give us our opening.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_MAELSTROM_02 - Avenge the fallen! Continue the fight!<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_PREHAGARA_01 - It's no use. The power of the Dragon Soul is too great. I cannot wield it safely. The raging forces within it may be the doom of us all.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_PREHAGARA_02 - Yes, I see. We can finally turn Deathwing's own power back against him.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_PREHAGARA_04 - We have no choice. We must have faith in our allies.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_ULTRAXION_01 - Strength of the earth, hear my call! Shield them in this dark hour, the last defenders of Azeroth.<br />
VO_DS_THRALL_ULTRAXIONVICTORY_01 - Taretha, Cairne, Aggra. I will not fail you. I will not fail this world!<br />
<br />
<br />
Hagara<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_ADDS_01 - Heh, even with the aspect of time on your side, you stumble foolishly into a trap.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_ADDS_02 - Don't preen just yet, little pups. We'll cleanse this world of your kind. <br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_ADDS_03 - Heh, you'll not leave this place alive!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_ADDS_04 - Not one of you will live to see the final Cataclysm. Finish them!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_AGGRO_01 - You cross the storm binder. I'll slaughter you all!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CIRCUIT_01 - What are you doing?!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CIRCUIT_02 - You're toying with death!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CIRCUIT_03 - You think you can play with my lightning?<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CIRCUIT_04 - Impossible! (scream)<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CIRCUIT_05 - No! More lightning!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CIRCUIT_06 - Enough of your games! You won't live to do it again.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CIRCUIT_07 - I'll finish you now, pups!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALDEAD_01 - The time I spent binding that, wasted!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALDEAD_02 - You'll pay for that!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALDEAD_03 - Enough!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALDEAD_04 - (Scream)<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALDEAD_05 - Again?<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALDEAD_06 - Impudent pup!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALDEAD_07 - The one remaining is still enough to finish you!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_CRYSTALHIT_01 - Get away from that, mongrel.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_DEATH_01 - Cowards! You pack of weakling dogs.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_FROSTRAY_01 - You face more than my axes this close.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_FROSTRAY_02 - See what becomes of those who stand before me.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_FROSTRAY_03 - Feel a chill up your spine.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_GLACIER_01 - You can't outrun the storm.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_GLACIER_02 - Die beneath the ice.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_ICETOMB_01 - Stay, pup!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_ICETOMB_02 - Hold still!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_INTRO_01 - Swagger all you like. You pups don't stand a chance. Flee now, while you can.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_LIGHTNING_01 - Suffer the storm's wrath!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_LIGHTNING_02 - Thunder and lightning dance at my call!<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_SLAY_01 - You should've run, dog.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_SLAY_02 - (blank)<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_SLAY_03 - Damn pup.<br />
VO_DS_HAGARA_SLAY_04 - A waste of my time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well of Eternity<br />
HighBorne Mage<br />
VO_WOE_HIGHBORNE02_EVENT_01 - I pray that the light of a thousand moons will grant me this honor.<br />
VO_WOE_HIGHBORNE02_EVENT_02 - Yes, light of lights! My life is yours.<br />
VO_WOE_HIGHBORNE02_EVENT_03 - The flower of life calls upon me! I will not fail you, my queen.<br />
VO_WOE_HIGHBORNE03_EVENT_01 - I pray that the light of a thousand moons will grant me this honor.<br />

VO_WOE_HIGHBORNE03_EVENT_03 - The flower of life calls upon me! I will not fail you, my queen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Illidan<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_BOSSCLOAK_01 - Return to the shadows!<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_BOSSENTER_01 - Nothing will stop me. Not even you, demon.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_BOSSPRECOMBAT_01 - Another demon ready to be slaughtered.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_BOSSVICTORY_01 - The hunter became the prey.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_BOSSVICTORY_02 - You did well, but for now I must continue alone. Good hunting.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_BREAKOUT_01 - Your magic is pathetic. Let me show you mine.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_CLOAK_01 - We now hide in shadows, hidden from our enemy.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_COMBAT_01 - We're leaving; stay close.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_COMBAT_02 - My blades hunger!<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_COMBAT_03 - This won't hurt a bit.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_COMBAT_04 - Death to the legion!<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_CONCLUSION_01 - The artifact!<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_CONCLUSION_02 - Brother, a timely arrival.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_CONCLUSION_03 - Aye, it's been twisted and turned by too many spells. The fuss we, especially you, made with the portal was too much. The same spell that sent the Burning Legion into their foul realm now works on the well. It's devouring itself and taking its surroundings with it. Fascinating, isn't it?<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_CONCLUSION_04 - If you've a way out of here, we should probably use it. I tried casting myself and Tyrande out of here, but the well is too much in flux.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_DISTRACT_01 - I will hold them back so we can get past. Be ready!<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_DISTRACTEND_01 - My magic is fading. I'm going through!<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_ESCORT_01 - Come with me if you'd like to live long enough to see me save this world.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_ESCORT_02 - So many demons, not enough time.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_ESCORT_03 - They will get what they deserve in due time.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_ESCORT_04 - I've seen a single guardian demon slaughter a hundred elves. Tread lightly.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_ESCORT_05 - They come endlessly from the palace.<br />
VO_WOE_ILLIDAN_ESCORT_06 - The stench of sulfur and brimstone. These portals are as foul as the demons themselves.<br />

<br />
That doesnt even make sense. You make 3.75 just by cutting them. No one is going to auction gems for 3.75 gold either, that is the bottom price after ah cut. Although if you want to send them to me for free Ill take them.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting if the posting fees go live. I would expect more uncut gems on the ah since you risk less if they dont sell as opposed to cut gems and it takes a lot less time. The prices of uncut gems will probably go down too due to more undercutting(less loss due to cancelling auctions). I could see it being more profitable to post uncut and offer cutting service in trade for a few min every day if your server has a lot of competition.</div></div><hr />

Maybe he's just naming the people who are and were most important to him. It doesn't matter if they were living or dead. Maybe, when it comes right down to it, these are the three people he cares most about in his life (or that had the biggest impact on his life).</div></div><hr />

I don't think he's a mary-sue, just a main character for this expansion. Can't really blame them either, since he's a shaman and this expansion is shaman-centric.</div></div><hr />

Who is this &quot;said people&quot; you're talking about? It's not like they care too much anyways nor stop them from raiding. Besides, it's only for one raid and a few dungeons. I don't see the point of complaining about it when it's pretty much temporary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Main characters tend to do that, bud. Arthas for example? It's pretty good for the story telling aspect. You don't like it? Ignore it. It's not going to hurt you. I'm starting to think people toss around the Mary-Sue term for too often, and not really know what they're talking about. Just because you don't like a character doesn't mean they're a Mary-Sue...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not incorrect to put 's after a word that ends in an 's.' I am writing a seminar paper on one of Dickens's novels, and all of the scholarly research I have read so far uses the 's at the end of his name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. That's the problem with setting up a story in an RTS series and continuing it in an MMO. We are the equivalent of the trainable units at the Barracks, not the heroes at the Altars.<br />
<br />
A new MMO can make players the heroes well. An MMO based on an established series can only make the players APPEAR to be heroes, but if they want the lore to move forward in any coherent way, they need canonical characters to take the credit, or unnamed fighters.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that because of when you put an s after ''s' '' you're writing ''his''?<br />
<br />
''I like Charles Dickens's novels.'' =&gt; ''I like Charles Dickens his novels.''<br />
<br />
Contrary to when you use it to describe the plural of items and such, where a s behind and ''s' '' would make no sense because it wouldn't show the addition of an extra word (''his'' in the last example''). Rather, when you have the plural of the word already containing a ´s´ as last letter, the double ´s´ would change the pronounciation of the word, thus, an apostrophe is added so people can still see it´s plural.<br />
<br />

Agreed! I'm actually hoping this is sort of 'Step 1' in Metzen's excitement in his quote about wanting to redeem Illidan from 2010's Blizzcon. This dungeon actually looks to be a lot of fun. And the Thrall escort doesn't sound as painful as Old Durnholde to boot! (I can hope...) The raid, IMO, is not particularly thrilling me at the moment(I have only read some boss abilities so far and I've been really disappointed in their raid boss design this expansion), but the 5 mans sound like they have some fun stuff in them.</div></div><hr />

I made about 2-3 million gold selling AH mats to people that actually need them. It is usually no problem paying like 10g fee to post your stuff and then having no sales for like 3-4 days. Then someone who levels enchanting suddenly buys a few stacks .... this works fine NOW. But I when I have to pay like 400g just to repost stuff that people hardly need then that does no longer calculate. I usually have mats worth 500-700k at the AH, be it recipes, dusts, essences, shards. Looking at the numbers above it means I'd have to pay like 3*2-3k a week just to get 5-10k back in sales.

Nah just kidding, it's a cool addition, would have surely saved one of my heirlooms I accidentally deleted once. But no more!</div></div><hr />

Anybody who says otherwise is just a plain ignorant cretin.<br />

And there is nothing 'weird' about the pronounciation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody who says otherwise is actually correct. <br />
And the guy doing a Masters in English Literature who claims it's fine to use Sergaras's (for example) should really question their teacher type person if that's what they told them (admittedly in this day and age of butchering language it wouldn't surprise me if the rules had been changed because it was too hard for people to understand)</div></div><hr />

Sargeras'<br />
<br />
i belive apostrophe s may be allowed, but it's not how i was taught<br />
<br />
Sargeras's would be bad<br />
Sargeras' would be good</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's allowed, just not as correct and makes you look silly.<br />
To demonstrate just how silly, make the noun plural:<br />
<br />
&quot;The Sargeras of the past had a shorter beard than the Sargeras of present day, both Sargerases's beards are still longer than mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now try actually saying &quot;Sargerases's&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, the reason i wrote bad was it's &quot;bad form&quot;, not incorrect perse, but .. bad<br />
<br />
i always was taught and will always continue to use a apostrophe to end the words, even if people do look at me as if i'm an imbecile, because that was one of the things i paid attention to at school :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making the price of gems cost more to post won't stem inflation, it will only make JC prices rise to negate the additional AH cut. JC prices are a reflection of mining prices since most people do not have hours on end to farm ore for prospecting. It's true what the Goblins say &quot;Time is money, friend.&quot; When a JC gets anywhere from one to eight rare quality gems and random normal gems from a stack of ore, the JC must sell what is demanded on the market at a price that will cover the expense of the ore and make a profit, preferably one that will pay for the current stack or ore and a future stack of ore with a surplus for investing elsewhere for the player. That surplus goes towards paying for world drop patterns such as the three new BOE's etc. It's the same thing since burning crusade so why would trying to alter the production profession have a major impact if nothing is done for its gathering resource counterpart?</div></div><hr />
