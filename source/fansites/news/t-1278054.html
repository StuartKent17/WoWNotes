Zandalari Warbringers Hotfix Clarification<br />
Ok, here is clarification from Lead Encounter Designer Ion Hazzikostas (Watcher) regarding the change to Zandalari Warbringers.<br />
<br />
Yes, it’s intentional. Zandalari Warscouts are supposed to be difficult solo encounters; you can use various control mechanics on them. <br />
Zandalari Warbringers, however, are designed for groups of players. They’re immune to snares and other control effects for the same reason that most 5-player dungeon bosses are: those effects would make the encounter easier than intended. Grab some friends, or invite the people camping the spawn to join your group, and you should be just fine. <br />
<br />
In summary, it is dangerous to go alone. Bringing friends should make taking down a Warbringer much more manageable.<br />
<br />
Was making Horrific Visage uninterruptabale also intended? <br />
Bring a friend with a dispel magic ability to counter Horrific Visage's fear effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oondasta Spawn Rate Increased<br />
I'd like to have an elite world boss not a rare world boss <br />
Agreed, this is an amazing fight of epic proportions and really tiny arms. We definitely want players to have more chances to experience it. The epicness should be about fighting it, not about finding when it spawns, even though that can also be somewhat fun as long as the timer is not so long that it gets frustrating.<br />
<br />
You should be able to find Mr. “Tiny Hands” Oondasta a bit more often now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Secrets of the Empire Drops and Raid Difficulty<br />
It seems like these are awarded randomly per person (LFR style) from normal mode raids. Is this intended? The previous tier had legendary items dropping randomly per person from LFR and to the raid as a whole in normal.<br />
<br />
Has anyone gotten a secret from LFR and Normal/Heroic? It seems as if just like the rep you can only get a shot at a secret once per boss. <br />
Everyone has a personal chance to receive a Secrets of the Empire drop on Normal/Heroic; the quest loot functions the same way that the Raid Finder version of the Legendary quest did prior to 5.2. <br />
<br />
We wanted to have a single shared chance per boss per week because we'd prefer to avoid making raiders who are killing bosses on non-Raid Finder runs to feel obligated to do Raid Finder specifically for Legendary quest drops. If those players want to do it for Valor or off-spec gear, that’s great, but doing Raid Finder shouldn’t be necessary for optimal Legendary acquisition. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257336-secrets-of-the-empire-lfr-or-normal-heroic/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8178768002?page=1#15))<br />
<br />
Mandatory Daily Quests<br />
I think one of the issues is not the amount of dailies, but the feeling that they're mandatory. We don't have any VP items on the new 5.2 daily reps (not technically true there are a couple, but they're low enough ilvl as to not feel mandatory for raiders), and we'll see how that feels for everyone. There's also not a lot of clarity about what you should be doing to progress in the most efficient way. If you hit 90 today you'd be wise to run some Heroics and only do the 5.1 dailies until you have the ilvl to queue for 5.0 LFR's, and then progress to 5.2 LFR, and you can probably ignore pretty much everything else. That is, if getting to 5.2 raids is your goal.<br />
<br />
But that's the important question, what is your goal? Why are you doing all of the dailies? What are you looking to accomplish? If it's to see the raid content then certainly working on all of the dailies every day is not going to help get you there, or at least not very quickly. And like you said trying to do all of them every day can really eat up a big chunk of time.<br />
<br />
We have a lot of level-cap questing content because there are a lot of people that just like questing, and it's there and gives some reward for doing it, but if you don't like that kind of content we don't want for it to feel mandatory. 5.2 was one step in that direction and if it feels like a good compromise for everyone we can keep going that way. If you want a big shiny dragon, sure you'll have to spend time on dailies, but it won't keep you from being able to progress smoothly, or feeling like you're missing out on an avenue of progression.<br />
<br />
The problem is dailies have become Blizz's go-to solo pve content for each new content patch.<br />
<br />
5.1, what was the new pve solo content to do? Dailies. 5.2? Dailies. LFD/LFR que's are so long, you can either sit in town, or do the only new content - dailies. People look forward to the content patches for NEW stuff to do, and when the only option for pve solo content is dailies, of course they will be sick of it. <br />
If we could produce unlimited amounts of content we would, of course, but the laws of physics unfortunately prevent it. Having repeatable questing content gives people who enjoy questing something to do. You're being unfair by glossing over LFR and dungeons because of queues. If you don't want to wait for queues you can build your own group and zone into the dungeon, like you did before (and dailies existed then too!), but the fact of the matter is that it's still more convenient despite the queue times. Or, you could play a tank or healer and spend no time in queues. That's always an option.<br />
<br />
If you have other solutions I'd be happy to hear them. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257309-my-first-and-my-last-rant-update/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197653184?page=8#156))<br />

How likely is it you guys will soon take similar steps across classes? Mists offered simplfied talents; are abilities next?<br />
Great question. We tried to prune abilities for MoP without much success. It's tough to simplify classes in a game this old. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311993933867655168))<br />

Yes, you can say that it's meant to be a troll head, but that is clearly the hole in the skull where the nose sits.</div></div><hr />

MMOChamp was started by EU but due to it's success it was later bought by US (curse) now you are saying that curse is officially supporting BL? If that is really the case then it's really sad to see the legacy of MMOChamp go down hill with a pro us guild campaign. MMOChamp was THE site to go back then, it had a reputation and neutral view of all things, I was sure the problem was chaud, with Boubouille this would never happen.</div></div><hr />

No we are not, it's that certain other websites support certain other guilds. Also, Boub is still here...there really is no region bias, just business.</div></div><hr />

Oondasta is not fun. It is not an epic fight. On high pop servers, it is a laggy mess. You will die a ton of times because the tank will die due to lack of heals because of lag and then run around killing loads of people at a time with his frontal cone.<br />
<br />
He is a failure on the part of blizzard.<br />

Yes, it does matter, the truth always matters.</div></div><hr />

So basically MMOChamp is a busine$$ thus one might achieve the front page 'news' not by merit but by other channel$. It's like a newspaper that only talks good things about a politician because he just made a donation to the paper or because the paper can profit with him regardless of being the most important news of the day or not. K gotcha.<br />
<br />
to sum it up impartial news on MMOChamp...? not so much these days.</div></div><hr />

What? Do you see McDonald's advertising Burger King? Honda advertising Toyota? The BBC advertising CNN? No...that just doesn't happen in the world. We still report the world's firsts and give recognition to the guilds that got them. We're not saying that BL was the first to release the video, it's just the video we choose to put on our site, since the other site does the same. We still report things as they happen how they happen, but a video is just a nice addition, but it's not news that needs impartiality, it's a freaking video after all.</div></div><hr />

'The other site does the same' ??? I don't know what site are you talking about that purposely select a specific guild to post a video on this tier of progress, all I see is first appear first posted videos everywhere. btw if this other site were to stop all WoW related news would mmo-champ do the same with the excuse 'the other site do the same' also if it's just a freaking video you should not be to much selective about it and post the first that come out.</div></div><hr />

No...WoW-Head most certainly does NOT advertise MMO-Champ. You don't advertise competitors, that's really all it is. We report on who kills, what, and when; that's the news.</div></div><hr />

It is probably just an expansion thing. There isn´t ongoing óversite´ of every little patch that gets added to the game. I think what they have to do is submit each expansion for ´review´ and then the Chinese people tell them what must be changed. It was very very early (vanilla) when china wow was changed to tombstones rather than skeletons.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, the review process has become much easier the last few years.. but there really is no reason for Blizzard to want to have skeletons anyway.<br />
<br />
I personally would like this as a glyph option. I already have the thingie wehre a flower grows from my corpse.</div></div><hr />

The day i start getting emotional over a game is the day Kim Jung Un says &quot;i love america,and all its people,i wish i lived there,my father loved them too,he has all the t-shirts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Relief is about as far as i go when a difficult boss i down finally dies. But shaking and getting emotional....just too far...</div></div><hr />
