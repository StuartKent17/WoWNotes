Timewalking - Feedback and Bug Reports<br />
A Timewalking holiday is currently active on the PTR, allowing players to queue for Burning Crusade dungeons via the standard Group Finder UI. Please use this thread for feedback and especially reports of anomalies with the experience.<br />
<br />
First off, some context for the feature, since I know there is some confusion regarding its scope and intent: Timewalking is intended to allow players to experience some of our iconic older dungeons in a relevant context, offering a change of pace to max-level and leveling players alike during the event weekends. For players who have nostalgic memories of racing through Shattered Halls in 2007 to beat the execution timer and complete a Trial of the Naaru for raid attunement, Timewalking will not recreate that experience. Sorry. I completely understand, and I have the same memories of needing to two-heal Skyriss at the end of Arcatraz because otherwise if your sole healer got targeted by his mind flay you were likely to wipe on the spot. But it is not possible to recreate that experience without fundamentally redesigning the dungeons, and that's not what Timewalking is about.<br />
<br />
What made those terrifying 7-pulls in Shattered Halls terrifying wasn't necessarily the encounter design, so much as the limitations of core class and combat mechanics back then. The default Protection warrior tank would be frantically trying to tab-Sunder through the different mobs to keep them from running off and attacking the healer, while AoE wasn't really possible on pulls like that both because of threat restrictions and because many specs or even classes had no functional ability to do AoE damage. Zereketh the Unbound in Arcatraz has three mechanics: Void Zone (the good old classic), Shadow Nova (a point-blank AoE), and Seed of Corruption (the old warlock spell as it existed back then). Attempting to make that a truly challenging encounter for today's players would require either making all the abilities do massive burst damage (more frustrating than fun), or completely redesigning the encounter. We certainly do update and reimagine old dungeons (e.g. Upper Blackrock Spire in Warlords), and will continue to do so, but Timewalking aims at preserving them in their original form.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the content shouldn't feel completely trivial, and we're aware that right now it often does. Some of that is due to scaling bugs (and in the case of some of those bugs, they will completely break any semblance of gameplay as you walk through two-shotting every enemy), but in general combat times are still too short across the board, sometimes not giving adequate time to even experience a creature's mechanics. Tuning is not final, and we'll be iterating on it over the course of the PTR.<br />
<br />
Known issues:<br />
The item level of rewards for scaled-down level 100 players is not final (it will be going up), though in general the intent is for the items to serve as catch-up gear, and not to contend with current raid gear. The quest associated with the event will offer a reward that is attractive to raiders of all levels. If you have a pet summoned before you accept your queue, the pet likely will not be properly scaled down, and will destroy everything. Some set bonuses and other procs (e.g. the T17 Demonology set bonus demon) are not properly scaling down.<br />
<br />
When offering feedback, I'd strongly encourage running an add-on to keep track of group damage, and reporting any notable outliers. And if you're using something with broken scaling, you're certainly free to continue doing so on PTR, but understand that it pretty heavily undermines the rest of the experience and thus your ability to provide meaningful feedback on that experience.<br />

What? How did spending 45 minutes once per week hold you back on that &quot;cutting edge progression&quot;? Seriously, 45 minutes to go farm 42 elites which supplies enough work orders for 7 days. As for the gating issue, irrelevant now with the rush orders. 1000 garrison resources lets you skip 20 hours of work orders.</div></div><hr />

I'm aware of that, which this change only makes it worst. Those gold invested in crafting professions were substitute to gathering professions I previously had.

<br />
I don't understand your logic. Blizzard is forcing the whole realm to farm in one spot, how exactly is that jackpot? In my case (Area 52), thousands of miners and herbalists will be competing for limited amount of nodes in one zone. Not including the reintroduction of botters in the area that'll happen. You're better off fishing, which what most of us will end up doing.</div></div><hr />

Already invested thousands of gold in crafting professions and building barns across my account. All that effort and gold went to waste.<br />
I barned up on my two chars as well, specifically (and only) for Felblood.<br />
<br />
Now that they changed it to felblight coming from gathering professions, to be completely honest, I think it's a good call. Gathering professions were beyond useless since everyone now has a personal mine and garden (in which WE can pick what to plant) in their garrison.<br />
<br />
Making the drops broader is a good call, and making gathering professions less useless is also a good call.<br />
The only thing I wouldn't mind would be for the Barn to be a source of felblight alongside those gathering professions. That'd make me extra happy.</div></div><hr />

But still, go farm some animals for savage blood and create one or two of the upgrade-items of your chosen profession and sell them. At least on my realm they still sell for around 10-15k each. You will make your invested gold back within no time.</div></div><hr />

In my case (Area 52), thousands of miners and herbalists will be competing for limited amount of nodes in one zone.<br />
As far as I'm aware, nodes (of any kind; herbs, mining, fishing pools) respawn near-instantly once they are depleted. You're competing with others for them, but as they are mined faster, they also respawn faster. So the 'bad' is at least somewhat reduced.</div></div><hr />

I was going to level up some more alts and get more barns. Good think I'm such a lazy-ass. Not only did I NOT spend money building up garrisons but one of my alts still has mining/herbalism from 3 expansions back xD<br />
<br />
Up side to all this is that Felblight might actually be a &quot;scarce&quot; resource vs everyonee and their aunt pumping rushed work orders out of 11 barns. So the price for the things might actually be worth running around in your ground mount to find herb/ore/fish nodes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ukerric</div><div class="date">2015-04-30, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Felblight changes are terrible. Already invested thousands of gold in crafting professions and building barns across my account. All that effort and gold went to waste.<br />
It's a PTR beta. Everything up to the last two-three weeks is subject to rather abrupt changes. They open PTR when they start having stuff to test, regardless of the status of the design for the rest.<br />
<br />
The Felblight change is good, because YOU determine at which speed it's going to come in. This will avoid the massive price jack-up, while avoiding the stockpiling. Everyone starts out fresh, you get to pick how you'll spend your time gathering Felblight, and get it at your rhythm, rather than having a massive advantage from bypassing daily lock-outs with a beevy of alts. If you're hardcore, you'll have your 60 felblight by evening, and get your massive weapon ready for raiding. If not, you won't need to sell 10 tokens to get gold to buy from price gougers who got lucky with their barns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding your crafters. Why did you feel the need to revamp your gatherers? I didn't. Any gathering profession, I could build an alchemy lab or inscription hut or enchanting pit for additional reagents or cards. The real bottleneck for profession crafting was always the blood, which was completely independent from the profession itself. And why would one spend gold on leveling professions whose recipes all require level 1 skill?<br />
<br />
Plus, of course, the fact that we don't have a Garrison scheduled in 7.0. Who knows how we'll have to gather in Whomever of the Whatever expansion?<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm out of 4000 GR. Constructing barns at that point was stupid, the right way to prepare was stockpiling Rush Orders as soon as you got near 10k GR. On patch day, switch to barn, 3h later, done. Which means I've lost, what 9-10k apexis dailies? Or maybe 500 ores?</div></div><hr />

True that tempered fate wont be irrelevant for alts, but anyone that seriously wants to gear up their alts to that level is likely to be prepared/pre-geared anyway, and I don't see casuals spending real money on gold, plus for casuals Hellfire Citadel LFR outstrips most of the gear from BRF, whom are very unlikely to be doing BRF Heroic/Mythic come 6.2. I was more pointing out that the new seals are not limitless, which is what he was complaining about.<br />
<br />
Considering you can get geared to jump straight into BRF LFR in the space of a day, I don't really see many people spending very much on t17 seals, when they only award 640/660 gear, as opposed to t18 LFR which awards 680, alongside the Mythic dungeons which also award 685/700 gear and do not use seals and are perfectly doable for your more time constrained player.</div></div><hr />

Yes you can, but it's very expensive since you have to buy most pieces of gear and upgrade them to reach 635. You also assume that the mythic dungeons will be some kind of &quot;faceroll&quot;, that's a huge mistake you're making. They're going to be very, very hard so they already cater towards well coordinated raiders. I really dislike that things like these are removed from the group finder in the first place. The game is *entirely* based on ITEM LEVELS and some know-how of the fights. They could allow normal raids to be run through LFR if they just bumped up the gear requirement. People are going to wipe on new encounters, regardless of difficulty. It's not like normal raiding is actual raiding to begin with. I'd even question that heroic raiding is actual &quot;raiding&quot;. Mythic is the default raiding but then again some bosses are so lame, but what do you expect out of a game that tries to cater to everyone.</div></div><hr />

I also didn't drop my gathering profs on any of my characters because I knew that, sooner or later, they'd make them useful again. The initial rush will make it pretty bad, but this does give people a reason to get out of the Garrisons and into Tanaan. <br />

<br />
Heroic dungeons give 630. If we're talking about people who have a few alts, they're likely able to craft at least one/two pieces of armor to bump up their ilvl, Crafted gear comes at 640 armor, 630 weapons. No upgrading required. you can get the ilvl required for HM LFR in Nagrand with a bit of luck. It's not very expensive at all and 635 isn't hard to reach at all. Worst case scenario, it takes you a week to get into LFR Hellfire once you've hit 100. <br />
<br />
You're right, normal raiding isn't exactly &quot;proper&quot; raiding, but there's a reason that it's not just set up as a random group finder, it still requires coordination, wheras LFR requires none. People should be able to vet who comes with them, just on the basis that you've got X other people's time on your hands too and I'm sure they don't want to have to deal with some ninnies who just stands in the fire or masturbates instead of taking part in the fight like LFR currently is. If you want to do normal, look in the pre-made group finder. It has issues I know, but there's also openraid, which has a much better community. Group finder just breeds asshats and scroungers. Considering how easy it is to get gear at the moment, a higher ilvl is pointless. Either it's so high that it's pointless people going, or it's appropriate and you get asshats and scroungers.<br />
<br />
And I think you'll find that unless you severely outclass the fight, know how of the fights is much more important than ilvl, especially if you're in mythic where you can't outclass it, or in a guild that doesn't have enough people to do mythic and can't outclass heroic. Heck, even having the tier sets/optimized stats from normal BRF made you significantly more powerful than being decked out in heroic HM gear before the ilvl boost. Optimization is the important bit, not ilvl. Unless you're massively undergeared as a whole, ilvl is a crutch for people who aren't that good. <br />

No, Mythic dungeons are not catered towards dedicated raiders, because the gear in them is eclipsed by Hellfire Citadel/Heroic BRF+(as it has tier sets), you get nothing out of doing it as a raider. They're catered towards the more time constrained player who still enjoys a challenge. And even if they are really hard, if you haven't got an hour to spend doing a dungeon, you are playing the wrong game.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd say heroic and mythic are the core difficulties, Heroic being for the core, mythic being for the hardcore. Heroic is still quite challenging (Blast Furnace and Blackhand spring to mind).</div></div><hr />

LFR requires a little bit of coordination. I'm sure you've been in a LFR that wiped because people were too dumb to kill adds or some other stupid mechanic(Durumu comes to mind). Tho, you can't really blame those on the player, many of them are just &quot;new&quot; players. It's just like you wiping on simple mechanics when you're trying to down some bosses in mythic/heroic mode or even normal mode depending on how bad your guild is. At the end of the day it's all about knowing the encounter but hey, that isn't enough now is it, no, you need the GEAR to boot as well. Good luck going in naked and killing bosses on mythic difficulty. <br />

Please, man, heroic isn't &quot;real&quot; raiding. That's what Mythic was made for, that's the closest to &quot;real&quot; raiding you'll ever get in WoW these days. Content is only challenging because 1) people don't know the mechanics 2) aren't geared enough for it. There is only one true difficulty when it comes to raiding in wow and that is Mythic. Period. The other difficulties were added to cater in to the more casual players in WoW.</div></div><hr />
