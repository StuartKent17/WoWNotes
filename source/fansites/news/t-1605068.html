Well we know everything thats going to be out in WoW for the next year. No need to ruin next years Blizzcon. People expecting next expansion reveal are going to have a bad time.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts exactly. :(<br />
<br />
Especially light on WoW, it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a lot of any stuff. There isn't even a single actual hearthstone panel outside of &quot;How to become an arena legend&quot;. Players are expecting some announcements for the next installment for it. Game is already getting boring again. <br />
<br />
As for WoW, I get it. WoD hits a few days after the expansion. But seems a bit bare bone to me.</div></div><hr />

The much-announced faster release cycle really won't work with those kinds of yearly Blizzcon announcements. Curious how they'll handle that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. I don't think we'll be seeing much of WoW this year. Though it's pretty sucky that it has to be this way. I'd expect them to be revealing things like Blood Elf model update, that &quot;big feature&quot; whatever they've been hinting at for awhile, and... well that's really all I'd expect.<br />
Other than that, not much going for it right now...</div></div><hr />

Feels like they're just kind of wasting their time this year. I feel like they're doing Blizzcon purely because of the anniversary date and that's basically it. They should have simply not had it this year and kept their devs in house to keep working on the games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100% agree. They've always followed up the opening ceremony with an instant panel on the hottest topic. That it's missing points more to secret keeping than there being nothing to discuss.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc9689b99ece</div><div class="date">2014-10-08, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think this is going to be the final thing...for a couple of reasons.<br />
<br />
They have changed schedules and maps before, after announcing something new. I was in Paris for the D3 reveal where they did that.<br />
The artwork for the floor map is equal to that of last year, which hasn't happened the last 5 times of blizzcon.<br />
The gap in the schedule after the opening ceremony is too big...usually it's more like half an hour.<br />
It seems there is a lack of panels...<br />
<br />
Sooo, my guess is they are gonna announce something and a new schedule will become available after the opening cermony...but hey, it's just a hunch.</div></div><hr />

Might have missed the sarcasm tags, but they did exactly that in 2008 (Worldwide invitationals in Paris) with the announcement of D3.</div></div><hr />

Will be like 2010s Blizzcon. They will talk about the process of making the cinematic.<br />

<br />
- Loads of WoW movie details and trailer<br />
- SC2 new expansion<br />
- D3 new expansion<br />
<br />
and maybe a brand new game(or old game continuation?) for time just after Opening Ceremony but that's only hope.<br />
so for WoW fans it might be pretty boring Blizzcon but not for game industry journalists and ppl(2 expansions + movie based on game)</div></div><hr />

Edit: Looking at the schedule, it seems awfully empty. Something doesn't feel right to me. It's not like them to do the Opening Ceremony, then 2.5 hours of live gaming before doing *any* panels...right?</div></div><hr />

Warcraft movie presentation, probably an early teaser for the film. Seeing as how the movie is a good 14-15 months away, it should suffice til a full-length trailer releases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is probably quite accurate. People do expect a lot. I think it's still good they do it, fans love it. <br />
<br />
Diablo III 'what's next' however, hmm that's interesting. I think they will announce the next expansion for that game, which is really intriguing.<br />
<br />
Shame about Wow but having played beta, this is not the INCREDIBLE expansion the game needs, but with all the recent announcements and shuffling, the next one should be. I guess it's going to be a cold winter night and no intention of playing expansion, but it's actually freezing and.. well there's nothing out I want to play so.. might as well? That's what will happen for many. The subs will rise. There will be a shitstorm though I predict. WOD is not what people expect. IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Yes... I was being sarcastic. I'm fully aware blizz wouldn't leave holes like that in the schedule, especially right after opening ceremony on the main stage. My suspicion is D3 or WoW. And it's a complete toss-up. I doubt it's a new title, but stranger things have happened.</div></div><hr />

Oh you mean the movie that wasn't even filmed yet? That's to be expexted. But now the filming finished like 4 months ago if not more and they already showed a preview at Comicon, behind the closed doors. And out of all the trailers that were leaked, THIS ONE was kept under lock and key.<br />

This. Whether or not this blizzcon is light in entertainment value or not, it's also a chance for the developers to meet and talk about what's coming down the pipeline. Also gives them a chance to sit back and have some fun with the event and take a small breather cause after these days are up it's back to the grind. <br />

The most annoying thing is that it's 10th year anniversary for WoW this year.<br />

Not making Blizzcon more &quot;about that&quot; seems like such a huge marketing oversight and a total waste of a moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason I leave out a D3 expansion is because there's a panel specifically surrounding RoS up there. Of course there is also one for WoD, but WoD is still upcoming during BlizzCon so it makes sense that it would get it's own panel as opposed to an upcoming ex-pack for D3 and then focusing on one that's a few months old.<br />

At least that's my opinion on it, I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Curious what they will say about D3 and SC2, but I'm not as hyped about those games as I am about WoW. I usually just play them for a few days/weeks when I've got nothing to do on WoW. But I'm still more hyped about D3 and SC2 than the upcoming Warcaft-movie :p <br />

<br />
I was thinking the exact same thing. Here I thought Blizzard wasn't screwing us by adding $10 to the Virtual Ticket price... but they still pull through and just cut out 1/3rd of the content. I'm pretty sure last year we had 2 simultaneous tracks of panels each day from end of ceremony right to the end of the day. Now it's 1 track and about half the panels are dedicate to Hearthstone and Heroes. Only 1 Q&amp;A session for Warcraft. Waste of money.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The much-announced faster release cycle really won't work with those kinds of yearly Blizzcon announcements. Curious how they'll handle that.<br />
<br />
Here's how they'll handle it - they won't, it's a lie and we'll still get 1 year of nothing (probably longer since now they are only doing 2 raid tiers an expansion).<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz totally left the main stage blank directly after opening ceremony. All the other blank spots are completely coincidental too. There's no way Blizzard would hide something from the schedule they don't want to tell us yet. They'd never do that.......<br />
<br />
In that case they'd put a blank spot there. They are starting opening ceremony an hour later cutting it down to 45 minutes and then leaving 2 hour gap... because there's no major announcements this year. Not even Starcraft 2 I am betting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing the 2.5 gap might be celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Wow with a look back at the history of the game, where it has come from, where it is now &amp; where it might be going in the future. Mostly just a making of the game with interviews with all the key players involved in the game and them talking about the history etc.</div></div><hr />

Where's your source on this? Their market for SC2 is far bigger than Heroes. They rule the RTS genre with Starcraft where as Heroes will struggle to get even a fraction of the player base that DotA 2 and LoL have.</div></div><hr />

If there's indeed meant to be nothing else there, why not move up the WoW panel? Better to have the empty slot later in the day than earlier. 2½ hours of nothing but tournaments right after the opening ceremony? Not happening.</div></div><hr />

Indeed the schedule looks disappointing, but last year we were so hyped because we knew the WoW expansion is coming. So far no BlizzCons turned out dissapointing, so I think I will trust Blizzard and buy the ticket also this time.</div></div><hr />

What sort of shit are you smoking? LotV is not being cancelled. In fact, Browder has recently confirmed that they are working hard on it.<br />
<br />
Stop making crap up.<br />

I'd say that there's a high chance that LotV will be officially announced with a cinematic trailer, and that the next D3 expansion will also be announced.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has WoW for storyline progression. Their RTS is Starcraft 2. There's absolutely zero need for something like WC4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also expect some of the gaps will be filled by the announcement of something Warcraft-related to mark the 20th anniversary of the franchise, some sort of remake/release/remaster of one or more of the RTSes. Not certain about that, though, not like the D3 and SC2 expansions.</div></div><hr />

Starcraft is nowhere near as big as MOBA. LoL has over 40 million players and makes more money than WoW. Starcraft is not even big in the eSports scene anymore as most Koreans have moved on to Dota2 since it's much more profitable ($10 million prize pools from Valve help). Hearthstone has shown Blizzard that &quot;big event games&quot; is no longer as profitable as making small games that can hit big with microtransactions.

If Blizzard was willing to kill Titan, killing a Starcraft expansion is no big deal to them.</div></div><hr />

If you would look closely this is one of the most exciting Blizzcons.<br />

Notice the huge gap in time where &quot;nothing&quot; happens on the main stage and panel stage after the opening ceremony? Look up schedules from previous years. <br />
<br />
There are no such gaps previous years.<br />

League is a free to play. Only way League make money is from riot point purchasing and tournaments. wow make money from month fee and stuff from blizzard store and easy make more money than league.

The gap with nothing seems a bit interesting though.. Besides, this is Blizzcon. No doubt people will be hyped about it. More so the people actually going there than watching it on stream.<br />

This is what I am hoping for personally. However, if there is indeed just a GIANT gap in time (time is money friend) I will find something else to do. I am so excited to be able to be going that the schedule doesn't bring me down - even a little bit.<br />

False and false.<br />
<br />
Just to back you up: LoL has 27 million players (quite a lot!) http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/01/27/riots-league-of-legends-reveals-astonishing-27-million-daily-players-67-million-monthly (http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/01/27/riots-league-of-legends-reveals-astonishing-27-million-daily-players-67-million-monthly/http://)/<br />
<br />
And they earned 624 million last year: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-revenues-for-2013-total-624-million-update/1100-6417224/ (http://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-revenues-for-2013-total-624-million-update/1100-6417224/http://)<br />
<br />
However Blizz - in 2012 earned 4.86 Billion. http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-02-08-activision-blizzard-closes-2012-with-record-USD4-86-billion (http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-02-08-activision-blizzard-closes-2012-with-record-USD4-86-billionhttp://)<br />
And just found it, blizz earned 4.58 Billion in 2013 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard<br />

Blizz wins the game.</div></div><hr />

If you look closely at the schedule, you will see that there is a 2 ½ hours hole between the opening ceremony and the next event. Do you really think they intend to leave the main stage empty for more than two hours just after opening ??? There's holes everywhere in this Schedule... on every stages. I suspect something new!</div></div><hr />

<br />
D3 released its expansion this year and given their track record for announcing games/expansions, the timing is off to share any ideas for a second D3 expansion. <br />
<br />
so really the main things they could talk about that would have any juicy stuff would be hearthstone, heroes of the storm and sc2. sadly sc2 is the only thing im interested in anymore from blizzard and i just cant see myself paying $40 or whatever it is for the virtual ticket when i can find out about the protoss expansion 5 mins after its announced.<br />
<br />
i could be wrong but i forsee this blizzcon being like the one back in 2010 i think, where basically the major announcement was the monk, or maybe it was witch doctor, class in d3. should have saved their money and done one next year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is another 2 hour gap before the closing ceremony this year as well, it probably doesn't mean anything. If blizzard announces something new it would be in the opening ceremony, and they would likely want the first panel to discuss new projects, which is why the 2 hour time gap at the start might mean something. I would guess it will likely be Legacy of the void, but blizzard might go off the wall and pull WC4 or a WC1 remake out. Metzen seemed to be alluding to another warcraft project at the cinematic revel that wasn't the warcraft movie. Plus with wow's lore being split in two with this time travel portion, they might be able to use that timeline for a new addition to the RTS game while allowing wow to continue to be the true successor of WC3's lore like they always said. The idea is really just a speculation though, odds are their revel is legacy of the void and life goes on as usual, but it is wow's 10th anniversary they might have something big for warcraft after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we have:<br />
<br />
1 - 2 ½ gap before the opening cerimony.<br />
2 - An yet to be revealed portrait for SC II on the goodies for Blizzcon.<br />
3 - Background and Icons for Warcraft III for Battle.net launcher.<br />
<br />
So my guess is an Warcraft Anniversary Edition with all 3 games in HD version.</div></div><hr />
