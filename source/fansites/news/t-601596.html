It also seems that World of Warcraft demo stations will be available after the opening ceremony (what a surprise) for 13 hours, which should be enough to test ... you know what.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rombato</div><div class="date">2007-07-29, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something to think about, they advertised that anyone with a 68-70 character could copy theirs over to use at blizzcon. So chances are they wont be testing an instance as they would have restricted it to 70 or had premades only. The earliest you can enter outlands is 58, going by that i assume 68 is the same for the next expack zone. As they have asked for 68-70 transfers maybe we are going to see some early work from the next expack after all ;D<br />
<br />
Incase anyone is wondering where i got the 68-70 bit from, its a blizzcon email sent out a few days ago.<br />
<br />
***BLIZZCON CHARACTER COPIES AVAILABLE***<br />
<br />
If you are a World of Warcraft player, you have an exclusive opportunity to use a pre-made character OR your own level 68-70 characters to try out new World of Warcraft content at BlizzCon. You have the option to copy up to four level 68-70 characters to a special event realm to experience this content, which has not yet been seen on test realms.<br />
<br />
Those wishing to make copies may do so at the Character Copy page, which will be available on the BlizzCon website (http://test.worldofwarcraft.com/blizzcon/) from July 23 until the end of BlizzCon on August 4, 2007. The character copy is completely optional--it is NOT required to attend the event or test the new World of Warcraft content.</div></div><hr />

We know that because in patch 2.1 there were files called &quot;howling fjord&quot; in folder Expansion 02. And we know that howling fjord is area in Northrend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We know it because there is already a decent amount of Northrend files in game, because Blizzard doesn't have any reasons to release something else, and because I know it.</div></div><hr />

Dude, please stop posting already. Do you actually think before you type? I read this forum all the time and your posts are always worthless. Do us all a favor and just read the forum and stop contributing. Lol @ your Northrend ideas. One Word: stupid.</div></div><hr />

That would be pretty interesting... glad I make my own ammo :P<br />
But I doubt Blizzard would do it.</div></div><hr />

Blizz is aiming at solo casual content remember? So it'll all suck :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just figured it'd be a twist on the usual, craftsmen would have a job out there and maybe make professions repair gear? Overall it'd cause players to have to work together out in Northrend rather then &quot;OMG PVP IN FIRST ZONE ALL DAY LAWL&quot; like Hellfire was for both my servers &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malineros</div><div class="date">2007-07-30, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is already a profession that can repair gear... usually considered the most useless/gimped profession. That's right, visit your neighborhood engineer and pay a flat rate (on top of what the bot charges to repair) to get grouped and watch the noisy little bastard appear... and eat more of your money.</div></div><hr />

It's a good idea, but I doubt it'll happen, if it did thought, you could get rep to a faction that would provide you with repairs at revered maybe. Or else just let the repair guy be the only guy you can interact with other than quest givers ;-) The rest I'm sure people will love going back packing :-)</div></div><hr />
