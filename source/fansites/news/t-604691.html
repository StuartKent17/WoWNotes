Legendary bow !<br />
Even if it wasn't a huge secret, the legendary bow is confirmed and will drop from a boss (probably Kil'jaeden). <br />
A few more details on this legendary weapon : it will be a loot like the Warglaives of Azzinoth, not a reward from a quest like Thunderfury.<br />
<br />
<br />
Archdruid hero class ?<br />
computerandvideogames.com (http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=181521) released the 2nd part of their interview with Tigole, well it's not really a second part because it looks a lot like the first one, however there is a very interesting comment about heroic classes.<br />
What's more, with any luck, we'll see more Hero classes some time after release, the hot Zitron tip being some kind of Archdruid quest directly connected to Malfurion Stormrage and the much-anticipated Emerald Dream.<br />
<br />

[Patch 2.4] Cooking recipes<br />
I already posted the stats of the new cooking recipes, but this time we're back with the full description of each item directly from a blue post.<br />
We have added two new cooking recipes for Patch 2.4: Charred Bear Kabobs and Juicy Bear Burgers. Both new recipes can be purchased from either Bale (Horde) or Malygen (Alliance) in Felwood. The recipes require 250 skill to learn, and use meat added to level 48-56 bears. This means it will no longer require fish to skill up your cooking to 300.<br />
<br />
Juicy Bear Burger<br />
Requires Level 45. Use: Restores 1933 health over 27 sec. Must remain seated while eating. If you eat for 10 seconds will also increase your damage and healing from magical spells and effects by up to 14 for 15 min.<br />

Charred Bear Kabobs<br />

<br />
<br />
[Patch 2.4] Combat log changes<br />
I'm not posting the full post because it's ridiculously long, but Vaneras confirmed that the new combat log will have tons of formatting and coloring options. There are a lot more details for UI developers on the original post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=2405449147&amp;postId=27455791692&amp;sid=1#0)<br />
The whole combat log also supports a new coloring model, based on context. While by default, entire lines are a single color, highlighting the most important details. The combat log also supports coloring just unit names, spells, actions and damage numbers. Spells and damage can also be colored by school. However, there are several features not exposed in the base UI that AddOns can use right away. These are event-specific coloring, unit coloring with greater granularity and the ability to customize the list of highlighted events.<br />
<br />
There are several other formatting related features. You can enable timestamps which show the time that spell or attack happened. You can show or hide square braces, change formatting without refreshing the combat log and disable the display of raid icons. These features were too niche to go into the base UI, but can be easily exposed for power users. By now you’ve already thought of some features of your own and are ready to get to coding. So let’s jump straight to some examples.<br />
<br />
Formatting &amp; Coloring<br />
One of the major combat log formats we considered while redoing the combat log was the Nurfed Combat Log format. This combat log format was very concise, made heavy use of color-coding and was one of the final candidates for the combat log. We eventually axed it on the basis of being too overwhelming for new users. However, we left in all of the options to convert the current combat log into the Nurfed combat log.<br />
<br />
Here’s how:<br />
<br />
Combat Log Settings -&gt; Colors<br />
Unit Colors:<br />
Me -&gt; Green<br />
My Pet -&gt; Dark Green<br />
Friends -&gt; Blue<br />
Enemies -&gt; Red<br />
Neutral -&gt; Yellow<br />
<br />
Colorize:<br />
Unit Names -&gt; Checked<br />
Spell Names -&gt; Checked<br />
Spell Color-by-School -&gt; Checked<br />
Damage Number -&gt; Checked<br />
Damage Color-by-School -&gt; Checked<br />
Damage School -&gt; Checked<br />
Entire Line -&gt; Unchecked<br />
All Highlighting Options-&gt; Unchecked<br />
<br />
Formatting:<br />
Verbose -&gt; Unchecked<br />
Braces -&gt; Checked<br />
Timestamps -&gt; Checked<br />
<br />
However, some people may want it even more terse than that. For this, we present:<br />
<br />
Hyper Condensed Mode<br />
To get rid of the word “Fire” and “Frost” type:<br />
<br />
/script TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_VALUE_SCHOOL = “”;<br />
<br />
That will remove the Fire from “55 Fire”. However, let’s go even farther:<br />
<br />
(Critical) (Crushing) (Blocked) (Resisted)<br />
<br />
All of these are really long. Let’s compress them:<br />
<br />
TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_RESISTED = &quot;R&quot;;<br />
TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_BLOCKED = &quot;B&quot;;<br />
TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_ABSORBED = &quot;A&quot;;<br />
TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_CRITICAL = &quot;C&quot;;<br />
TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_GLANCING = &quot;G&quot;;<br />
TEXT_MODE_A_STRING_RESULT_CRUSHING = &quot;Cr&quot;;<br />
<br />
Now we get<br />
<br />
[You] [Fireball] Hit [Spider] 64. (C) (5 R)<br />
<br />

40 Players dungeons<br />
We have no plans at this time to reintroduce 40 person raid dungeons, we plan to continue with our current models of 10 and 25 person raid dungeons and make them better than ever. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4311169082&amp;postId=44201353394&amp;sid=1#10))<br />

Account security reminders<br />
Eyonix posted two reminders about account security and thing you definitely shouldn't do with your account password. (Just don't give it to anyone :/)<br />
We wanted to provide the community with a few friendly security reminders. It is very important that players take caution when being directed to outside websites and update the security on their computers accordingly. To secure your computer, we suggest adding some Internet security to your system (for example: a firewall and anti-virus scanner). If you are unsure what security measures to take, discuss the issue of system security with your ISP or a trained Network Administrator for the solution that is right for you.<br />
<br />
We also strongly recommend that all players use the Blizzard Launcher to start World of Warcraft. In addition to serving as a portal to the game, the Blizzard Launcher provides greater security for our players against harmful software such as the type discussed here. To learn more about this utility, please visit the Blizzard Launcher Page and check out the Blizzard Launcher FAQ.<br />
<br />
Also, please be sure that you have the most secure operating system environment on your computer by running Windows Update (if you own a Windows-based PC) or Software Update (if you own a Mac) and installing all of the updates marked “High Priority”. Note: you may have to run the updater more than once to ensure you have all the high priority updates; many of the patches require a system restart, and then additional patch installations to complete the process.<br />

<br />
Thats so untrue - it is confirmed that a legendary ranged weapon will drop in SWP, there's no information about what kind of weapon will it be. Looking at Blizzard philosophy for designing items for BC and WotLK, reading WoW forums (didnt they said that it wont be a bow? there was a blue about it) we can assume that:<br />
- it probably WONT be a bow, because troll hunters/warriors/rogues would benefit from it more (1% crit) than others<br />
- it probably WONT be a gun, because dwarf hunters/warriors/rogues would benefit from it more (1% crit) than others.<br />
<br />
IMVHO it will be a xbow, just because that wont push any race to benefit more than others. Or... (lol)... it will be a wand :), since Blizz stated that it will be a ranged that many classes will benefit :).<br />

&quot;I invite you to read again the initial subject: (url here) which never indicated that this weapon remotely legendary appears for the update 2.4, and even less which boss would give it.

<br />
the 6th is the middle of february? i know its a short month but 10 days seems so little, even for a leap year!<br />
<br />
also don't be surprised about a late april release, some people have even predicted early summer and then a WotLK release before christmas, giving guilds ~6 months in sunwell and farming all the new content before the next major grind. given the class changes they will be testing to create balance and a number of bug fixes and BG adjustments they have planned, i imagine it will spend quite some time on PTR.</div></div><hr />

that is pointless by example the 2 highest dmg ranged items are bows and there is no gun better than za or tk. Maybe blizzard should design the amoeba ranged item so nobody could get benefit more than others xD</div></div><hr />

would be a cool idea, im just curious how far they take the heroic class thing before everyone gets to choose a heroic class, and a normal class is just what you grind until you do some uber long quest chain to become heroic. it will be interesting to see how they work in those types of classes in the future :/</div></div><hr />

when your talking about tearing through i would consider plate in that category as well. a warglaives rogues not in full resilience but some more armor pen and dps gear can really put a hurting on us.<br />

I hate lorelawling.. <br />
<br />
all draenei werent goods, see the ones on auchenai, and there wont be much diference bettween dks and locks sumoning things on cities</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't the Warlock/Priest designs be switched along with the Warrior/Paladin set? I'm assuming they should go in line with the dungeon sets.</div></div><hr />
