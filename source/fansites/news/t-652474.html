Worldwide Invitational<br />
The World Wide Invitational is not a European equivalent only. It was held twice in Seoul in 2006 and 2007 before it was held in Paris in 2008. There will be no Worldwide Invitational this year, as it will be combined with Blizzcon. Whether there will be further WWIs or not is something we have no news about right now.

Blizzard Development Team<br />
There are different types of designers. Some work on quests, encounters, world events or zones. My team works on classes, items, tradeskills, UI, PvP, combat and pretty much most of the crunchy bits of WoW. It's a great team of very talented players and they don't get the recognition they deserve. This is partially because some of them wish to remain anonymous. (Shameless plug: we are hiring an item designer. Check the hiring portion of the site for more details.)<br />
<br />
Within our team, nobody owns a particular class. We all work on them together and nobody make a change (at least a serious change) without getting consensus from everyone else. We draw on our own experiences, community feedback, internal testing, data collected from the live game, and correspondence with friends, guildies and other players whose opinions we've grown to respect.<br />
<br />
We also interact a lot with the other designers, because they all play the game too and many have a great deal of raiding or PvP experience. They come to our meetings or just drop by with an idea or a piece of feedback. That goes for the rest of the WoW team, and in fact all of Blizzard. We are extremely collaborative and not particularly hierarchical.<br />
<br />
Our designers tend to be fairly technical as the industry goes, and some of us know a little programming, but typically we aren't writing actual code though we do write scripts and make data queries if you understand the distinction.<br />
<br />
The programmers are a separate but equal department. They do write code and they are extremely talented, sometimes intimidatingly so. We ask them for new features or code changes that would improve the game and they tell us what is feasible, what is risky, and suggest alternative ways to get what we want. They are all gamers too so it's really a back and forth process as we work on an idea together until we come up with something we are happy with.<br />
<br />
The process is similar for interacting with artists, or really any other component of the team. The big secret of WoW's success is that Blizzard just manages to hire very, very good people who &quot;get it.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779759031-i-got-it.html))<br />
<br />
Hire more developers!<br />
Whatever your list of problems with WoW looks like, I can assure you ours is much longer. We are very hard on our own design and we don't think there is a single aspect of WoW that can't be improved. If you sense a problem in the game, particularly one that has been around a bit, it is almost certain that we know about it and just haven't gotten to it yet. Sometimes players suggest that we do hire 100 class designers so that we can get even more changes into the game. That isn't a good idea for a couple of reasons. One, we already change the game faster than some players can realistically handle and we give them whiplash. Second, I just said that WoW's secret is that we hire great people. We can't hire up too quickly without diluting our talent pool, and even great new hires need some time before they really understand our philosophies. Just as WoW's art has a consistent style, so does the rest of the game, and learning that takes time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779759031-i-got-it.html))<br />

Battlegrounds<br />
Objectives in the new Isle of Conquest Battleground<br />
As for skipping objectives ... that is something we've thought about. In this particular battleground, the objectives are more of a strategic choice and less of a &quot;you must cap them all&quot; scenario. Though kudos will be in order for those who manage to take all of the unique objectives. <br />
<br />
[...] The whole battleground is designed with the intention of you seizing your goal. So yes, rush to the hanger and acquire the airship so you can assault the enemy keep. Or rush to the factory, and claim it, so you can bring the walls of the enemies keep down around their ears. Don't think for an instant though, that you're going to be able to win the day without the assistance of at least one of the three offensive locations.<br />
<br />
As for reinforcements and why you should hold the resources that garner them. We don't have a fixed number to give for their totals just yet. However, the Oil Derrick and the Cobalt Mine aren't just conduits for reinforcement acquisition. They also give you honor. The longer you hold either of them, the more honor you're going to amass - win or lose. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17779758697-isle-of-conquest-preview.html))<br />
<br />
Airships in the Isle of Conquest<br />
The airship will have a set flightpath, though you will need control of the hangar to be able to get on board. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17779758697-isle-of-conquest-preview.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Balancing classes<br />
When we make balance changes, we don’t always provide advance warning. If it’s something coming in a future patch, we might offer a preview. If it is something that is currently a problem AND it is easy for us to fix (not everything is), then we act on it. We see no reason to sit on a balance change for a week just so the medicine goes down easier. That isn’t fair to everyone else that isn’t your class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779497838-when-will-the-fix-come-to-the-poor-retadins.html))<br />
<br />
Crushing Blows and Blocking<br />
Crushing blows were basically like another way for mobs to crit -- sometimes (and you didn't know when) a really big hit was going to come. It might have made healing exciting but the only way to handle it tanking was to randomly throw up your short cooldown defenses and hope that sometimes they overlapped. Of course sometimes you'd get a crushing blow right after a normal hit and a special attack and you'd be liquid.<br />
<br />
The way more bosses work these days is that a big hit is going to come at reasonably predictable intervals. If the intervals aren't predictable, at least they have cooldowns so you know when they aren't going to happen. Then timing the use of your cooldowns with these big hits is a test of skill for the tanks, and often the healers.<br />
<br />
We recognize that blocking no longer provides the mitigation it once did, and we think that is a problem. But we don't think bringing crushing blows back is the way to fix it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17779498402-what-was-so-wrong-with-crushing-blows.html))<br />

Hunter DPS in PvE<br />
We think Survival PvE dps is in a good place, and we're hoping Marks looks better with the last recent tweaks. It's just a little early to tell. BM is still low and needs a buff. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779768795-why-should-pve-hunters-bother-playing.html))<br />
<br />
Hunters in PvP<br />
PvP is another story and we're not happy with hunter performance there, at least in Arena. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779768795-why-should-pve-hunters-bother-playing.html))<br />

Vindication<br />
Vindication was overpowered. Period. Trying to portray it as a misguided nerf based on us not understanding the mechanic is unlikely to be effective at getting the nerf reverted. When we announced this change, the typical forum response was “Thank goodness.” Now you can try and spin that as community being misinformed about how the talent works (that happens sometimes). You can try to spin that as the community just hating you and wanting to see your class destroyed. In this case we find both of those explanations unconvincing.<br />
<br />
Health is not stamina, but the two are closely related. The fact remains that Vindication did the equivalent damage of a very big hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779497838-when-will-the-fix-come-to-the-poor-retadins.html))<br />
<br />
[...] The design of Vindication was not for killing healers. The design was that you could debuff your opponent. The mana and health consequences of the debuff were so severe that they totally overshadowed lowering the target's damage by decreasing their Str or Agi.<br />
<br />
Next patch we will more than likely change the talent to be a debuff that feels more like a debuff and is usable in PvE and PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779497838-when-will-the-fix-come-to-the-poor-retadins.html))<br />

Totem Mechanics<br />
We've already announced our intention to change some of the totem mechanics.<br />
<br />
I will however touch on one thing. If totems have super-gigantic ranges then their position matters a whole lot less (at least in PvE where they are rarely in danger). They become a whole lot more like other types of buffs. When and where you place them is supposed to matter. The design intent of totems is not that they are pretty much irrelevant to playing the class. That's not what the shaman is all about.

<br />
Ironic, since the current state of totems means that, outside of fights requiring tremor/cleansing, I drop a single totem in raids and because it's so ineffectual I really don't even care if my party is in range of it or not.<br />
They currently are irrelevant to playing as Resto.</div></div><hr />

i could justify anything with this type of reasoning, even comparing Vindication to Mana Drain or healthstones. of course i'm not saying nerf Fort etc, that would be silly, i'm just pointing out that you can argue a case for pretty much anything being OP if you follow Blizzard's line of somewhat lacklustre 'justification'.<br />
<br />
i don't care much about the nerf i'm used to it, but the 5% Vindication was based upon it reducing HP by 20%, now Blizz have admitted it doesn't, am i too optimistic to expect a slight tweak to the nerf so it scales accordingly? sounds to me a little like 'yeah, you proved us wrong, but we're still going to do whatever we want'.<br />

<br />
No, because when fort gives you stamina it doesn't also give you health. It also costs a GCD and doesn't passively proc off being hit.<br />
<br />
Vindication wasn't nerfed because it caused you to lose some stamina. It was nerfed because it didn't require any choices or effort to be made by the paladin to cause a significant loss of stamina - beyond, at some point, putting points in the talent.</div></div><hr />

On a second note, more paladin nerfs. I love how the blue post put emphatically that vindication was OP, period. Really? The trump card is simply that everything that has been nerfed to the ground has been stuff that Paladins have had since their inception. None of this shit are new or crazy abilities. As a matter of fact, many rets don't even take vindication, so how could that be an OP talent then? lol<br />
<br />
If HOJ, Bubble, Vindication, burst damage, Blessing of Freedom, holy damage, etc was so way OP, then why was it been 4 years before the nerfs started coming? Can't say it was because the class changes made them OP because BC ret, even without any gear existing for the class, was more capable than the current version after all the nerfs.<br />
<br />
After 4 years, NOW stam being reduced is a problem. Please /end hypocrisy</div></div><hr />

I am curious, whom does he mean? Does he mean idiot, who wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;Vindication was overpowered. Period. Trying to portray it as a misguided nerf based on us not understanding the mechanic is unlikely to be effective at getting the nerf reverted. When we announced this change, the typical forum response was “Thank goodness.” Now you can try and spin that as community being misinformed about how the talent works (that happens sometimes). You can try to spin that as the community just hating you and wanting to see your class destroyed. In this case we find both of those explanations unconvincing.&quot;<br />
<br />
after 6 season of vindication being in place? Remove *any* specific class good ability, and the rest of &quot;community&quot; would say &quot;Thank goodbess&quot; as in the competetive environment you created everybody want other classes to be as weak as possible.<br />
<br />
Or, probably, &quot;very good people&quot; are those monkeys who wasn't able to fix login server for 4 days? Or another bunch of morons, who can't make game work with ATI cards properly? <br />

Arguments like &quot;we are right, you are wrong. period.&quot; begin publicly declared by official shows that neither he nor his boss are &quot;very good&quot;. Especially after earlier cretinistic arguments about &quot;low bracket&quot;. <br />

I am not mad because my paladin is hurt. Everything is clear with paladins for quite a while. Good players got it while ago - look at top 20 teams in the tournament. I am getting mad because those blizzard bastards lost the shame.

They've already pointed out that it wasn't a problem in the higher brackets. That makes it very hard to nail down. The problem was that in the lower brackets, you have a lot of teams that either can't cleanse it or don't bother or don't take the talents that make it harder to apply. This is really a failing of those teams, but having a &quot;I will always beat people who don't know any better&quot; feature to your class isn't exactly a win.

Agree, its not just that blizzard had &quot;eureka&quot; moment and saw light at end of tunnel after 4 years of brainstorming.<br />
Btw, for ppl which agree with every nerf have question: &quot;what is retri paladin if you take his burst and vindication(which allready is like crap)?&quot;<br />
Just 1 buffing class with bubble class which can cleanse/protect and watch fight from distance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBH just opposite of this I don't think Vindication was THAT huge a problem even right before it get nerfed. I reffered to the 6 seasons, because I think that something which is in place for soo long should not be just &quot;hotfixed&quot;. And Blizzard communicate it in the way that it was clear for everybody that Vindication os OP and they just done right thing as soon as possible. Which doesn't look like true. If it was so obvious Vindication is OP, why it wasn't nerfed with the first set of pala nerfs? Why we have seen couple of pathes which doesn't touch it and then - oops - get it nerfed as hotfix? <br />
<br />
It doesn't look like well planned and well thought change. The way how they communicate it also doesn't show it was well prepared action. Looks more like some of the leaders there got drunk, come to the office, started to play his rogue and got killed by paladin, then pathed game overnight, and then ask other to somehow communicate it -)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talking in fairness for a sec.. All of BC I had to deal with Rogues being the most over powered class in PvP and one of the best dps in PvE. They never got touched. 2.4 comes out and ret is clearly in need of toning down, I mean they're wiping people out with divine storm and they're beasts. <br />
<br />
<br />
It's 3.1.. Ret has been toned down They're good in PvP yeah but OP? idk I can kite them easy and I'm Enhance. They're damage is good in PvE. I'd say they're finally in a good spot but people don't like that.. They want they're lolrets back because they can't deal with the fact that this game changes. <br />

They should get used to it soon.. Cause Shamans aren't going to be punching bags forever and when we get our PvP fixes that are well deserved.. (go ahead and deny that.) well, I'm going after every Rogue I see.</div></div><hr />

Notice they backed off the 20% comment. And didn't even touch on the lower bracket portion. <br />
<br />
Realistically, lower bracket arena pvp is dominated by pve'ers in pve gear, in pve specs, thus Vindication likely doesn't even come into play.<br />
<br />
However, they are right in pointing out that as something that does cause a debuff that is equilivant to good crit, without requiring a GCD then that is significant. Also, however, using that justification, there are a lot of debuffs and maybe even some buffs that will need to be reworked.<br />
<br />
Throwing Vindication out as a &quot;hotfix&quot; and basically making it so OP as needing though, still makes no sense. There are a lot more things in game that need to be hotfixed that a &quot;supposedly&quot; massively OP talent that really isn't. Especially when this supposed solution will probably not do anything to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
For example - &quot;hotfixing&quot; the &quot;All instances are full, please try again later&quot; (or whatever the exact wordage is) is more in need of a hotfix than this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact remains that Vindication did the equivalent damage of a very big hit.<br />
Except that's a blatant lie and many people even believe this bullsh*t. This is NOT the way Vindication works. <br />
<br />
Vindication reduces the stats AFTER the hit and unless the Pala hits like a sissy or the opponent is a bear who stacked ridiciolous amounts of Stamina, Vindication CANNOT take any HP because their live bar is already below the new Hit Point limit.

<br />
Let me add: I'm not saying they WERE wrong, but that their reasoning and stance makes them SEEM wrong.<br />
<br />
Personally I am glad vindi was changed BUT ONLY IF Blizzard takes a good long look at Paladins and re-works them in a way more befitting a skill-based class. Remove the plan of &quot;BURST IT DOWN!!!!!!!11!!!!1&quot; and give Paladins another useful tool or two. Not even offensive, but perhaps some group-defensive abilities that would make them attractive vs MS/wound poison/aimed shot teams etc.<br />
<br />
But hey, Blizzard ACTUALLY making a solid ret-paladin build/spec is probably just wishful thinking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mushin</div><div class="date">2009-06-15, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol fort doesnt give you health? lol whaat? and vindication was specifically nerfd because it caused you to lose stamina. welcome to the game, which you said right after you said it wasnt nerfed for that reason....lol?<br />
<br />
Fort increases maximum health until it's dispelled. When it's cast it doesn't heal you for as much health as it gives. As opposed to Vindication which reduces your maximum health until it's dispelled, at which point it 'damages' you for all the health it was reducing.<br />
Vindication was nerfed because it was a passive ability that was &quot;equivalent damage of a very big hit&quot; - you don't see them nerfing other classes' big hits because they actually require GCDs and resources, and you don't see them nerfing Fort because that requires GCDs and resources (and does not have the opposite effect to Vindication).<br />
<br />
Paladins have plenty of passive damage dealers Blizz can nerf to balance out their damage - Vindication just happens to be the one that won't affect PvE so it was the first target. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not even offensive, but perhaps some group-defensive abilities that would make them attractive vs MS/wound poison/aimed shot teams etc.<br />
<br />
Paladins have the biggest group-defensive tool box in the game. Ret just needs a better way of dealing damage and it should be fine.</div></div><hr />

Think about what you're writing. First you're assuming every anti-vindication post is from a paladin. I've seen many posts and in fact saw a poll post that was about 36% that said change was bad. Last I checked, 36% of WoW population wasn't paladins.<br />

Really.<br />
<br />
<br />
People are focusing on the Stamina element of Vindication like that was the only thing it did. I understand this nerf - on one hand I am not happy about it (you see, I have a 71 Pally and it sure as hell made leveling easier to instantly remove 20% of its attributes by doing anything to it) It didn't work on most elites and won't work on bosses, making it a very lackluster talent for anything but farming or pvp.<br />
<br />
In PvP however, 20% reduction in attributes is pretty hefty for something that requires no action other than auto-attacking and gets applied on almost every swing. With zero effort, it was removing a very sizeable portion of Max HP and Max MP from a target. That means casters are oom faster, and because they have less total health, you essentially can HoW them sooner. That isn't even taking into consideration one Divine Storm applying the debuff to multiple targets. . .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rather than apply a hotfix which makes it significantly weaker and arguably worthless vs many classes, they should have reworked it into something more meaningful, perhaps on a cooldown. <br />
<br />
<br />
When Wrath launched they went after rng based stuns with a vengeance, and now having cleaned up all of those annoying abilities they appear to be going after certain damaging abilities which just &quot;happen&quot; or are set and forget (i.e. Ret Aura, Thorns and now Vindication) which they deem &quot;too powerful&quot; for something that takes zero effort to maintain.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but the didn't just &quot;hotnerf&quot; mace spec for arms warriors and leave them with nothing. They CHANGED it to something else. See the difference?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nikkita</div><div class="date">2009-06-15, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they should start looking at other classes that aren't balanced at all.<br />
<br />
how can druids be amazing god healers, pro caster dpsers that give a insane raid buff, cats and bears that either proform high dps or a tank that is as decent as warriors and DK's? they are too good in any spec.<br />
<br />
Whats up with shamans being good melee dpsers (good), abit meh caster dps and healers that feel useless? resto shaman's feel like they aren't good enough: how is that &quot;fun to play&quot;? how is &quot;i feel useless casting CH&quot; fun? its not. (so apperantly it wasn't CoH breaking the balance it was WG).<br />
<br />
How can retri paladins be at their spot, holy paladins never go oom and qq about aoe healing, and prot paladins probably the least desired tank for something that needs to survive? where is their last stand and superduper amazing in any spec?<br />
<br />
can go on most of the hybrids feel too much of unbalanced: but on the bottom line you can be a total noob that started playig a week ago and rock as a resto druid, you can be playing from vanilla a resto shaman and feel useless? nerf some classes and specs, make the game more fun being OP isn't fun - no wonder there is a lack of druids in the game they are so easy and too good they are boring - is that fun to be OP in every spec? no its not, its boring and not challanging, and becomes even more boring when all assume you don't have skill you just play the correct class. is it fun to feel like you lack a niche, like your useless? no its not. Its fun to play and feel like your contributing, its fun to feel that if you put a effort you rock. the game isn't this way at the moment not even close.<br />
<br />
And whats up with the blessings? bring the player not the class? every raid we insist having atleast 2 paladins, guess why? right blessings.... If they didn't have blessings that were that good we would've taken players that are better then them (our paladins aren't amazingly good). Why is there no equivilant to stamina, kings and Gift of the wild? why is BS duration so short without any way to increase the duration to a pve encounter? why does mana spring have such a small range - i stand in the other side of the room in mimiron and don't get the spring. And isn't it about time to combine the mana spring with the health spring, and making poison/disease cleansing raid wide?<br />
<br />
Game balancing doesn't start and end at retri's, about time EVERY class get reveiwed properly. Or else remove the stupid &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; idea and roll with something else, cause atm we aren't brining the player we are brining the class. (in other words, a average-crap resto druid &gt;&gt;&gt; a briliant resto shaman, and that is sad, also: 2 paladins in raid or 3 - just for the blessings we really don't care how they play they can suck, as long as they bless).<br />
<br />
If your roll with a idea of bring the player not the class, everything should look more balanced, it seems like some classes are blanaced and some are just overly powered, and some were forgotten just cause they were overpowered in sunwell. (i &lt;3 shamans).<br />
<br />
And FFS: lolwell is still: LOL WELL!!</div></div><hr />

It was basically a mana burn for those who could cleanse it or if it wore off. And for the guy who said ret was performing subpar? You aren't a pure dps class. <br />

/Case Solved<br />
<br />
<br />
Translating: &quot;I'm on the other side off this nerf and I salute every single nerf against my oponents, the more, the better for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
God forbid people wasting some mana or GCD with a Retpaladin if not to smack others using him as a weapon while &quot;/loling&quot;, amiright?<br />
<br />
Wonder what is blizzard position (and non-paladins) about other procs that doesn't use any GCD and are also anoying debuffs (to say at least), and some of those debuffs stack and come from fast hitting classes...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vice</div><div class="date">2009-06-15, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also amusing to me how everyone seems to jump on the &quot;Vindi was OP. Period.&quot; bandwagon the moment it gets mentioned in a blue -- despite of course the fact that it has been there for ages... It's as if everyones age-long grievances at the hands of the tyrannous Vindication are finally being appeased. QQ about vindication wasnt even existent a week ago ... ERGO this wasnt some heartfelt community sentiment ---&gt; rather players leaping on any chance they get to support a put-down of their opponents. You can do better than that</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greivence</div><div class="date">2009-06-15, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i've found it surprisingly funny that after 4 pages of Vind nerf QQ the 1 or 2 times anyone has posted something said with logic ( Meaning knowledge / research / unbias'd opinion ) they were completely ignored<br />
<br />
The vid nerf needed to happen because, QQ, it was an extra attack that did wat? 20% of ur health in 1 blow? Cuz if u don't dispell it u loose 200-400 str on a war ( Big deal )<br />
<br />
Maybe they should leave vind how it is and just make it -agi str int spi ( counter greatness card? )<br />
<br />
For the love of god dont use my post as more QQ quotes either. thats just annoying. The problem with retadins is that it's a melee class with better burst then a rogue that can heal / become invincable. Vind is a burst nerf if u can be clearheaded enough to think through it.<br />
<br />
And for people who are QQing that its a talent not every ret uses , i say, &quot;so?&quot;<br />
<br />
Why does everyone have to use something to make it OP? The good ret's that can understand game mech's use it, and they are the rets that kill healers by making them dispell vind till they have 5k hp then storming/judging them to death. That's why its OP.<br />

<br />
Very easy fix for that, when its dispelled you regain that health. No need for anything else</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hypocratus</div><div class="date">2009-06-15, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sad mechanic of this is the following - after WOTLK paladin's huge overbuff the community divided as 9 to 1 - 9/10 was QQ to nerf paladins. Eventually, paladins were nerfed enough but as 9/10 were still QQ Blizzard keep nerfing palas (as Blizzard are driven by QQ, except the fact that they all play rogues and therefore rogues are never nerfed and often buffed). Even when palas were nerfed enough for all normal people to stop playing them, still 1/10 (paladins) were QQ when paladin got nerfed and 9/10 were happy, like some of the morons in this thread. <br />
<br />
The way to go for paladins is to stop QQ about them being nerfed (they are already nerfed enough for just stop playing ret) and start QQ about some other class. Don't pick rogue - they are never nerfed - let's take priest for instance (Hypocratus is my priest in game, so it's fair offer). Eventually some other people forget about ret paladins and join us in our QQ about priests and those arrogant rogue morons from Blizzard will move they geniality focus to priests too. Bingo - ret palas are not nerfed anymore, and, well, at less can play some battlegrounds in between raids.</div></div><hr />
