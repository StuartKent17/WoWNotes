Classic LFG Addon Disabled<br />
We‚Äôve been closely following the community discussion around this add-on for WoW Classic, as well as analyzing it to make sure we understand how it works. After careful examination, we believe the nature of ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic. Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.<br />
<br />
In line with what we shared at BlizzCon last year, we intend to be very careful about allowing add-on functionality that might undermine aspects of the social dynamics that are core to the Classic experience, even in cases like this where it‚Äôs clear that the addon author had no ill intent and was simply trying to provide a service to the Classic community. Ultimately, if a streamlined group-finding system was something we considered compatible with Classic, we would have kept the modern Premade Group Finder tool rather than choosing to remove it from the Classic client.<br />
<br />
It‚Äôs difficult to articulate a clear-cut rule for exactly when an add-on crosses the line. However, when an add-on goes beyond presenting information or providing aesthetic customization, and attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely.<br />

Thats the point - they just think they do. As if Classic will be time machine and take them back back 15 years when they were younger.<br />
80% of user base will drop it till end of year when they realize not every class is viable in long term, they need to acualy eat and drink while leveling and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah wasn't fun to spend 2-3 hours to form a group for a single dungeon run (in many cases it ended in being a single run with a group). And sitting in the main city didn't help as there were no chat that spanned all major cities and most of the people that were at the lvl of the dungeon were out in the world. Thus you usual just ended up using the &quot;Who list&quot; by typing in the lvl range you wanted and whisper every single person if they wanted to do the run.<br />
And then when you finally have spend a good time whispering all players of the specific class for a healer or tank then you had to wait 30-45 min for the people to arrive at the destination, cause of no summoning stones and usual people hadn't quested in the are so they had to run.<br />

<br />
yeah, there's no possible reason why people would want to play classic other than &quot;trying to relive childhood&quot;<br />
<br />
obviously<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Also, blizz said the average age of players during 2004-2006 was 28, so...your whole &quot;childhood&quot; argument is already dead. Shoo, troll.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

&quot;realize&quot; this, &quot;realize&quot; that<br />
<br />
do YOU &quot;realize&quot; that Classic is being made specifically for people who have been playing pservers the past 5 years?<br />
<br />
idiot<br />
<br />
Also, every class is viable in PvE and PvP, but of course you wouldn't know that since you've never actually played vanilla and only watched videos of &quot;you think you do but you don't&quot; people spreading bullshit misinformation about it.</div></div><hr />

lol somebody was never trying to do an ony attunement and needed the specific quest done in BRD and would wait hours and hours for the right people to be available.<br />
<br />
Hour long waits in trade chat were a common thing, even in popular guilds. Most people, even guildies, didn't want to go spend hours doing a dungeon they needed nothing for. And assuming you even found a tank, for example, your healer might have just peaced out to do something else along the way and you're waiting again.<br />
<br />
To say nothing about having someone drop out in the middle of a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Yeah right. I remember looking for entire nights with no dice. Especially the leveling dungeons that aren't zone-level appropriate like RFD or that belongs in dead zones like uldaman and sunken temple. Then someone quits midway and the run is ruined.<br />
<br />
Classic is amazing but the way to make groups is shitty. People will just use a realm discord instead of the addon instead, creating the same issue in the end, except it's not as handy as having it ingame.<br />

I knew the LFG channel went up and down, but having a LFG channel is pretty much the same as the LFG addon to me. I just want to be able to keep grinding and questing while looking for my group/new members. Nothing great about being afk in org for 1h LFGing or losing a member midway and getting cucked for the entire run.</div></div><hr />

I never had this problem on retail, and never EVER had this problem on Nost. I‚Äôve had plenty of groups fall apart inside of the dungeon though, but whaddya‚Äô do? Remake it.<br />
<br />
Edit: I think the reason I didn‚Äôt have problems was because 1, I healed as Shadow leveling. 2, I‚Äôd collect all quests I could for the dungeon I‚Äôd want to run and advertise that ‚ÄúLF3M WC, have quests ready to share!‚Äù Same can be said for Deadmines</div></div><hr />

Yup and people then went back to Orgrimmar or Ironforge for another hour looking for a sub, where often the group would just end up dissolving.<br />
<br />
I think it is you who was exposing themselves as not actually playing back then. At least you've outed yourself as a Nost player, where the game code was heavily edited to make things easier or more streamlined lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the problem was back then there were a lot of information you never got told. Like I first learned now that there actual existed a LookingForGroup channel (I thought it was first added in Wrath). And since we didn't have major information sites that handled information like this (the only site I know of back then was Thottbot). And I wasn't really a forum guy back then (first began checking forum in Cata and more or less left it since WoD as I got fed up with people).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenfoldor</div><div class="date">2019-08-24, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the addon exists, the most common argument I've heard is &quot;you can just choose to not use it.&quot; When something as efficient as a LFG addon is introduced, the benefits are so great that is actually hurts the progression of a toon not to use it. It puts those players not using this addon at an extreme disadvantage in every competitive aspect of the game. It creates an opportunity cost simply by existing.<br />
<br />
Creating groups through in game social channels is part of the MMO experience that was World of Warcraft. Whether or not you enjoy that portion of the game, effectively removing it via a super efficient addon in the name of quality of life does effectively remove &quot;creating groups through in game social channels&quot; for everyone. IMO this is a positive move.<br />
<br />
If you are worried about how this will affect other addons, I don't think you should worry. You are imagining a problem that currently does not exist, imo. However, I respect your right to worry, but I would also suggest giving the devs a chance to implement this correctly. It seems they know what they are doing, just imo.</div></div><hr />

Classic is amazing but the way to make groups is shitty. People will just use a realm discord instead of the addon instead, creating the same issue in the end, except it's not as handy as having it ingame.<br />

I knew the LFG channel went up and down, but having a LFG channel is pretty much the same as the LFG addon to me. I just want to be able to keep grinding and questing while looking for my group/new members. Nothing great about being afk in org for 1h LFGing or losing a member midway and getting cucked for the entire run.<br />
<br />
reading comprehension lacking?? the LFG channel in Vanilla (and in Classic) is a global channel. You can participate in it from anywhere in the World doing any activity...absolutely no need to be AFK in Org to get a group.</div></div><hr />

meetings stones (added in patch 1.3) didn't work the exact same way and were reduced to mere summoning stones in patch 2.0.1 after the introduction of the LookingForGroup global channel which was an improvement.<br />

Really stupid move on their part. Most of the crybabies don't even understand how it works and its nothing like the current in game LFG tool we have now. Blizzard just caving to a bunch of wining babies that never did as much as to look at how the addon works. Have fun with the Classic hype. You know all those people that complain about flying, loot rng, boring rotations? All the mount farmers, transmog farmers, progression raiders. Ya they are all going to be running back to retail after this hype train is over. Most of the people who played classic are in their 30's/40's now.

Yes, it's one of the arguments that never felt logical to me. How can a community be &quot;tight-knit&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; but still needs to be protected from certain outside addons that threaten to &quot;destroy&quot; it? Addons that just aimed to streamline some features of WoW to help some people. I mean, it's not like the addon could invite people from other servers to your Maraudon group, so how would it &quot;ruin the community aspect&quot; of Classic? At least, I don't think cross-realm grouping is available for Classic. Could be wrong, though.</div></div><hr />

Being social, forming groups, getting said group to the dungeon area with people leaving half way through with no easy replacements... that's Classic WoW.

Sure you can spam dungeons if you want to miss out on all of the rep requirements to unlock world quests and have to do all of that anyway after the fact. Spamming dungeons in BfA is a lot less rewarding on xp than previous expansions due to stuff like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I look forward to the grind levelling, the discovery of areas, the punishing mobs, the sense of danger, the need to group up for quests, the 1 faction per server rule that demanded a good standing on your server and the long lost faction pride.<br />
<br />
I also look forward to the little things, such as only 1 hearthstone with a 1 hour cooldown, the need to sit and drink/eat/bandage while out questing, plotting out your path to ensure you don‚Äôt get swarmed by mobs, the discovery of those little easter eggs and pop culture references that make you smile for no real reason other than fun, the mounts at level 40, the sense of achievement when you levelled, collecting soul shards again and the carrot on the stick trinket.<br />
<br />
I look forward to the return of professions that actually matter, professions I can once again take pride in, levelling and collecting mats and patterns and the ability to need to interact too get and supply items and trades.<br />
<br />
There have been so many changes in retail that the sense of faction pride and good standing in the community was lost long ago and I for one have missed that aspect of WoW for far too long.<br />
<br />
Whether I end up enjoying that experience or not does not diminish any other players enjoyment for playing either classic/retail or even those that will play both, but damn I am going to have fun finding out.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about, there is 0 benefit to level through questing in WoW lol it's slow and pointless rewards, Miss out on rep? anyone leveling atm is an alt and already has flying so the only reason for rep is exalted caches for gold/resources/ap. Which is easily obtainable at 120 and easier to do with world quests/emissaries which take 5minutes to unlock at 120 than questing at 110-119. <br />
<br />
My guess is you don't even have a 120 yet, and if you do you're still working on Rev reps</div></div><hr />

Imagine having to invest time and energy and reaping the reward with the potential for strong item drops only found in dungeons, making the difference between you being able to handle a single mob or two mobs at the same time out in the open world once the dungeon run has concluded.

<br />
There was a crude LFG tool in Vanilla, you could queue up for Dungeons at an Inn Keeper and it would attempt to automatically form the group. It was a deeply flawed tool, it's participation was low and the groups it formed were almost never functional due to lack of ability to select a role, but it did exist. It was absolutely the precursor to the modern automatic LFG that was introduced in Wrath.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, there were plenty of LFG addons out there before the Global LFG channel was added. Most of them simply listed your name, class and had room for a little bit of text - Almost identical to the LFG system that was in place throughout TBC. Auto invite addons also existed in Vanilla - Mostly for use in PvP battlegrounds back when you had to invite everyone into the group manually during the setup phase.<br />
<br />
I get that people were very clear about the fact that they wanted &quot;No Changes&quot;. But in this case they're begging Blizzard to make changes not to what Vanilla was, but to turn Classic into what they believe it should be. All the core systems and functionality for this kind of addon were implemented by Blizzard themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very happy to see addon functionality is being limited, and only UI visibility and usability improvement addons are promoted.<br />
<br />
How far do we push this though? There was an addon in Wrath that would add information to your HUD in real time, such as where safe zones from AoE was and allowed you to overlay tonnes of other useful information such as when you were out of range of healers or hostile spells. The name escapes me, but Blizzard quickly broke it because of how powerful it was.<br />
<br />
Such an addon would be fair game in Classic based on your limitations. And, of course, the API at the time would still support it, so do we rewind the clock and say that's allowed because it's not due to be broken until Wrath?<br />
<br />
Do we take a step even further back and allow Decursive and similar addons? They were, afterall, a big part of Vanilla too. Just because Blizzard eventually broke them should mean I'm allowed to use them in Molten Core, BWL and ZG like I used to, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game is designed around building friendships with other players, so when you need a group for a dungeon you just reach out to your network of friends.<br />
<br />
The idea that you have to stand in a city and spamming trade chat is completely wrong. You were never meant to do that. You were never meant to play with strangers everytime you went into a dungeon.<br />
<br />
You were meant to find friends and play with people that actually mean something to you. Otherwise you might as well play with NPCs.<br />
<br />
LFG tools are not needed in classic because you have your friends.<br />
<br />
If you don't know how to be social and make friends, then you will most likely not enjoy classic. It's a social game.</div></div><hr />

Social interaction is encouraged, auto-matching is discouraged.<br />
<br />
It is one thing to have a web app to socialize and find friends to play, and another to automatically match people without even saying &quot;hi, can you please inv me&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even the web app will not be able to auto match, because it will need to access Blizzard's database and I am pretty sure that they will not allow it. <br />
<br />
So, use any external social tool that you like, as long as it doesn't automate matching withing the game.</div></div><hr />

Lol everyone saw this coming. Half of the community that has been dying for Vanilla WoW also want all of the quality of life addons and features that come with current WoW. You either get Vanilla or you don't. It doesn't go both ways.<br />
<br />
Good change. Lazy morons who want fast convenient game can fuck off to BfA.<br />
<br />
Just another classic example of people thinking they want the Vanilla experience but they really don't. There was no LFG addon/tool in Vanilla there shouldn't be anything resembling it in Classic. Period. Use trade, LFG, and guild chat like people did in Vanilla. Don't like it? You don't want Classic. You think you do, but you don't. Too bad.<br />
<br />
Good Riddance. <br />
What's up with all the retards complaining? Go play bfa.<br />
<br />
Classic WILL HAVE LFG REGARDLESS of your opinion. One way or another, if not in-game then via web. You won't change that fact ;] You fight an already lost battle. Get over it.<br />

This exactly. If anything, Blizzard should have left in place QoL things that were just there to pick from retail client. LFG and modern Quest tracker should be supported by game by default.<br />
Many other things that are made into addons already such as: vendor item price, enemy cast bar, debuff duration timers and such.<br />
It will be there from day 1, just as it was in vanilla.</div></div><hr />

How can a community be &quot;tight-knit&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; but still needs to be protected from certain outside addons that threaten to &quot;destroy&quot; it? Addons that just aimed to streamline some features of WoW to help some people. I mean, it's not like the addon could invite people from other servers to your Maraudon group, so how would it &quot;ruin the community aspect&quot; of Classic? At least, I don't think cross-realm grouping is available for Classic. Could be wrong, though.<br />
<br />
No, no cross-realm anything, it's all about the fabled realm-community!<br />
<br />
A community so solid and tight-knit that any threat to it (Real or otherwise) must be eliminated at any cost!<br />
<br />
I am seriously (Not intending to troll) interested in how many people nowadays will put up with spending ages standing around town (Getting help for especially L40-range dungeons from guilds was pretty tough too), finding that tank or healer for a dungeon run, sure it worked back then, but gaming and the gamers themselves have changed over the past 15 years...</div></div><hr />

Maybe as a tank or healer. As a dps, many nights I never got in on a single run. Weekends were better, but midweek, forget it. <br />

A lot of classic discussion has a lot of gaslighting involved. Classic will be what it is, but trying to negate or deny people's experiences serves no purpose. (And no, I wasn't on a dead realm, I was on an original 20 high pop realm.)</div></div><hr />

Looking for people for dungeons is not going to be a fun experience.<br />
It was actually fun and engaging. You had to keep reputation on server. People knew who blacklisted ones are. So you actually couldn't join, leech or leave or act like a jerk like you can in last couple expacs. <br />
<br />
I just wish EU realms had option like there is here in China. You MUST input your real-name info and id card when making account. It takes out all the toxicity from games and people are actually being careful what are they typing in online games.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2019-08-24, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People not realizing (not you sensible bro's and sisters, but the QOL crowd) that investing time and energy into finding a group, thus raising the value of dungeons and dungeon gear by not making it insta-spammable content accessible at the click of a button, is the character progression that people crave from the original game.<br />
<br />
Imagine having to invest time and energy and reaping the reward with the potential for strong item drops only found in dungeons, making the difference between you being able to handle a single mob or two mobs at the same time out in the open world once the dungeon run has concluded. It almost sounds like an RPG doesn't it?<br />
<br />
LFG QOL ragers stay mad, the classic family at large welcomes this stance by Blizzard<br />
<br />
I think the bolded part is something the classic haters have to consider. Playing vanilla, to reach the end game, was a commitment. The whole &quot;second job&quot; thing. Some players want that. And they should get it - we did. That's the whole point of classic to me. <br />
<br />
No clue how big this community will end up being, but I get why they're looking forward to it. A (hopefully) small part of the classic crowd are the kind drooling at the idea of gatekeeping content and standing on the Ironforge bridge pretending to be an &quot;inspiration&quot;, but that's their fantasy to waste time on. IF the classic servers bring in a good flow of people at all levels, it could succeed. Personally, I'm thinking it will flow with the content on the retails servers - when content is near it's end, more people will go over to classic, when patches drop, they'll go back to retail and play the patch. I'm just laughing at both ends of this debate - the &quot;You'll be sowwy!&quot; classic players that have entirely too much invested in it emotionally, and the other end, with the people who want it to fail...to prove...what? A lot of people played and quit for the same reasons the first time, they will again. But it's for them to decide. Considering it's included in the sub, I think that alone will bring in a steady flow of players, curiosity alone could drive a LOT of players.</div></div><hr />

Realistically what will happen is that this LFG-tool will be re-imagined into a web-app that you keep open in your browser and tab to, Imagine you visit say &quot;classicgro.up&quot;, enter your realm, link your char profile and then start listing as usual. <br />

There was an &quot;LFG&quot; called group finder (IT wasnt an addon, it was a feature made by blizz). You could que up to 3 activity (raid, dungeons, group quests). Even had automatch function.<br />

While it was added in end of Vanilla, there was one.<br />

I know there will be sites and such instead but just like Openraid (which was awesome) , it's far less popular than an in game easy to use feature that kills all communication and encourages people to become brain dead zombies.

The lfg at the end of vanilla, if you remember, just filled up the group with anyone looking. <br />
<br />
It didn‚Äôt take into account tanks, healers, or dps just filled it up. Usually with dps<br />

There is no role to be filled in the long run. Those that are so entitled and addicted to the anti-social retail lfg won't even make it to 60. There won't be much need for a third party thing after 1-2 months when everyone actually interested in classic has a guild/discord community or just doesn't feel like dying because he has to message a few people to form a group.<br />
Everyone who wants that addon has his view warped by playing too much retail. The only way they see running a dungeon is if the group pops up by itself in 2 min and they roflstomp it semi-afk in max 10 min without saying a word. Thats their ideea of what a mmorpg experience should be.</div></div><hr />

One of the biggest drivers for Classic is because high-end gear has been so easy to get on Retail for many expansions that gear rewards and accomplishments don't feel that special.

There is a massive difference between those websites and add-on: add-on fully automates everything, except teleporting. Without it you'll need to talk to players, to invite them. Websites can't post messages to LFG and whisper players, websites can't invite players.</div></div><hr />

At that point Classic would become neither a recreation of Vanilla or Retail, just a sort of hybrid mess of something in-between.<br />
<br />
This addon wont magically give you more loot. You'll still have to go to the dungeon, kill the boss, pray RNG to get something, etc.<br />
<br />
But Classic will already be an hybrid between both : People are used to go to wowhead, read guides, sim their chars ... A bunch of people going to Classic will be from Retail, and the community thing won't magically go back to how it was 15 years ago just because you have to &quot;/2 LFG DM&quot;.<br />
<br />
Besides, a LFG addon would still work in the community, especially if you can build a blacklist.</div></div><hr />

The VAST majority of players are going to be retail players, not new, fresh virgin players. Due to this, they will already know the zones, the routes, the resources, the websites, the best classes, the best builds, where to get the best gear, how to level quickly, how to get gold quickly and on and on and on.<br />
<br />
You purists that think this Classic version will somehow stay pure are fooling yourselves. Will it be harder, sure I guess, mostly just harder in the time investment it takes to do anything. The game certainly isn't any harder nor are any of the mechanics. Will raids be harder, sure I guess, if by hard you mean the logistics because certainly the mechanics are mostly brain dead. <br />
<br />
The thing that made Vanilla so great was that it was new to all of us and while I understand the desire to go back to those days, I really really do, I just dont think it will play out that way in the long run. I have no doubt it will be hugely popular in the beginning, but it will fade away as a fun alternative once in awhile and/or aspects of modern WoW will slowly make their way into the Classic game. Once that happens, we will start this entire argument over again because we will have people that want LFG and such and those few purists that want to hang on to the past.<br />
<br />
Either way, enjoy yourselves Classic players, I am happy you got what you want, I just cant be asked to devote the time that it will require.</div></div><hr />

Organizing groups outside the game wouldn't violate any terms of use. They just want to stop addons from providing any sort of auto-grouping behavior via messages in some hidden chat channel. No website or third party application would be able to access the game internals</div></div><hr />

A quick moving spam channel does not replace a good old list of eligible parties looking for similar content. The advantage of a website is you could copy/paste the whisper / invite code and use it in the game. More annoying than an addon, but about as effective in the end.</div></div><hr />

Believe it.<br />
Some times there just are no people interested in doing your thing thanks to a severe lack of incentives to repeat run some content.<br />
This combined with a lack of a dedicated group finding section means, even those few who might be would never find out you were doing it.<br />

Its a very poor system that is obviously not in place on purpose, but people want a time machine instead of a functioning game and that is appearing like what you are getting more and more.<br />

One of the worst feelings for me in Classic is forcing people who don't need or want to do a dungeon to come with me just because I can't go otherwise.<br />
Its solved in TBC, and its completely the opposite in Live.<br />
<br />
Its a shame its not only so present in Classic, but we are actively encouraging pugging being less supported by breaking addons that most people don't even fully understand the purpose of.<br />

Just because no one conceived of this addon in 1.2, the mechanism to implement it was present in the API. That's all that is changing.

How many realms do you think will be left?<br />
<br />
Going by how the team currently responds to feedback, I'm sure that if the playerbase starts to think a LFG tool should be alright as a whole, then they'll consider it. The game should start as as much of a time machine as possible, otherwise people will blame change X for it not being perfect. If it starts as a time machine and people slowly start to agree on what small things should change, it'll be much smoother.</div></div><hr />

You don't decide what I should and should not be against. If they make an addon where people not using it find disadvantages, it should be removed, like this addon. I couldn't care what addons people use, as long as I don't find it disruptive for my own gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Well it certainly never took me hours upon hours to fill groups. Maybe for BFD because it was so out of the way, but that's about it.<br />

I think all realms will be left and they'll eventually have to add even more. They're already talking several hours of queues for the highest pop realms, the &quot;lower&quot; pop realms aren't THAT much behind the higher pop realms.</div></div><hr />

Its not particularly hard finding a group in classic, and what I love the most is all the spontaneous groups. See a &quot;lf1m healer&quot; in general chat? Just send a whisper and you can soon be good to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eosia</div><div class="date">2019-08-24, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another classic example of people thinking they want the Vanilla experience but they really don't. There was no LFG addon/tool in Vanilla there shouldn't be anything resembling it in Classic. Period. Use trade, LFG, and guild chat like people did in Vanilla. Don't like it? You don't want Classic. You think you do, but you don't. Too bad.<br />
<br />
No one is getting &quot;the Classic experience&quot;. The Classic Experience was from launch until December 4th, 2006. Period. This is just some approximation far from the original. You're getting the content and the class design. That's it.<br />
<br />
LFG will NOT damage communities. In fact, it is a tool to actually help grow them. It's just people cannot tell the difference between LFD/LFR and LFG. LFG is just an interface that helps make group finding more accessible because you do not have to manually parse through garbage in channels. Since Vanilla, at most, will have the old Battlegroup structure and most likely only that for Battlegrounds, LFG will only consist of people on your realm. So now you can use LFG to find a group and actually <br />
make some friends.</div></div><hr />

Searching for dungeon groups while leveing isnt exactly always a great experience. Who really likes sitting in org at lvl40 to find a group for RFD.. To me, classic was way more than that,but whatever, I'll live with it, it just sucks i have little time to play since i have a kid and some nights ill probably waste my time looking for a group just to log off havijng done nothing :/<br />
<br />
So you don't really want to relive Classic WoW. Got it.<br />
<br />
You just described the entire experience of Classic WoW.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, only add-ons that existed back then should be allowed now. If people want to play Classic they should actually have to play it.<br />

They had an addon in vanilla to find groups.</div></div><hr />

1. They are only talking about Classic WoW<br />
2. Those addons just present information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in BFA you can do whatever you want in the world and people can just click join to your grp.. in classic you have to sit in a main city and write in the chat. <br />
<br />
that's the difference, It dosen't feel like a long time in BFA since you aren't stuck/locked</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet again you people prove how this project is a failure, you never wanted the classic experience to begin with, you just got blinded by your rose-colored glasses. I cant wait to see where this classic will be after 6 months, probably close to abandoned.<br />

No in Vanilla we had addons to help form groups. Thanks for showing up to the party though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine having to invest time and energy and reaping the reward with the potential for strong item drops only found in dungeons, making the difference between you being able to handle a single mob or two mobs at the same time out in the open world once the dungeon run has concluded. It almost sounds like an RPG doesn't it?<br />
<br />
LFG QOL ragers stay mad, the classic family at large welcomes this stance by Blizzard<br />
<br />
Imagine people not realizing addons are only in affect for the user, those wishing to waste hours looking for groups the vanilla way can always do that, others having an addon that helps does not affect you unless you also use the addon, amazing isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Its one reason why we have LFD/R. <br />
<br />
Stating the obvious, but as someone who actually played Classic and sat for hours looking for someone to fill a spot because we didn't have enough guildies (or before I had a guild, in fact), it was a huge timesink I didn't want to deal with.<br />

<br />
I see what you have done there...no idea how I could ever counter that....ahh... well on 2nd thought<br />
<br />
Vanilla WoW was considered &quot;easier&quot; than the most of the games that pre-dated it but it was never for everyone...countless millions of people tried it and didn't like it for a variety of reasons...hence why WoW has had over 100,000,000 total subscribers and never more than 12 million active subscribers at any one time.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
A quick moving spam channel does not replace a good old list of eligible parties looking for similar content. The advantage of a website is you could copy/paste the whisper / invite code and use it in the game. More annoying than an addon, but about as effective in the end.<br />
<br />
you can leave other channels to reduce chat spam...and once you're out in the world, with the possible exception of Barrens chat, the chat channels aren't spammed as often and its easy to take a sec and scroll back to see if you missed something while in combat...I know this level of &quot;effort&quot; is too much for people that grew up on modern WoW and have to have absolutely everything done for them (quest giver icons, all quest objectives outlined, auto group formation and the list goes on and on) but either deal with it or play Retail. Classic will survive without you.</div></div><hr />

Some times there just are no people interested in doing your thing thanks to a severe lack of incentives to repeat run some content.<br />
This combined with a lack of a dedicated group finding section means, even those few who might be would never find out you were doing it.<br />
<br />
Its a very poor system that is obviously not in place on purpose, but people want a time machine instead of a functioning game and that is appearing like what you are getting more and more.<br />
<br />
One of the worst feelings for me in Classic is forcing people who don't need or want to do a dungeon to come with me just because I can't go otherwise.<br />
Its solved in TBC, and its completely the opposite in Live.<br />
<br />
Its a shame its not only so present in Classic, but we are actively encouraging pugging being less supported by breaking addons that most people don't even fully understand the purpose of.<br />
<br />
Gonna be interested to see what August 2020 looks like for this product. <br />
<br />
How many realms do you think will be left?<br />
<br />
that's hilarious...first there is a LookingForGroup Channel in Vanilla/Classic that you can join from anywhere in the world to help you find a group<br />
<br />
2nd...you think you're not forcing people who don't need or want to do a dungeons in Retail when in fact you are everyday...in Retail people are forced to run dungeons with you on a continually basis long past the time that most people would bother doing so because Blizzard has specifically tied core game reward systems to incentivize players to such a degree that they do the content over and over and over and over despite being bored to death of it and finding it mind numbing and soul crushing...</div></div><hr />

Too simply form a group while not in a major city / spamming in trade and world channels the problem really came from the cross server links.<br />
Along with the instant teleportation to dungeons which killed of the sense of world scale along with the server community which is key to classic wow.<br />
A simple grouping tool alone would have only made the experience better in my opinion.<br />
As you would still have the server community combined with your server reputation and you would still need to manually travel to the dungeon.<br />
But i guess making a LFG macro and hitting it every 20-30 seconds or so is part of the classic experience even tho it kinda sucked</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like you didn't play vanilla. <br />
<br />
Many groups were formed for dungeons in the place you were leveling even if the dungeon wasn't close to that area. If you were sitting in org you weren't doing it right. <br />

I remember doing this all the time and then running as a group to the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want a in-game LFG addon then you dont want classic. If you wont play because there is no LFG addon, then you were not gonna play to begin with. There is nothing wrong with using outside resources for LFG, but there shouldn't be that capability in-game simply because it was not available in classic. Its not about recreating the exact experience of 15 years ago, that will never happen. Its about creating an experience as close to classic was originally. The argument stating the fact it wont be the exact experience means we should just throw everything out the window is absurd. Yes, there will be other addons that will be used that were not around during original vanilla. In a perfect world they would not exist either. But we have to pick our battles, some addons are more experience breaking than others. LFG is arguably the biggest community change to WoW, we're purposely trying not to make that mistake again.</div></div><hr />

Does it? I remember the LFG chat to be only across capitals, and only the World Defense channel being really global, with only certain rank able to speak in it.<br />

<br />
I don't think we play the same &quot;retail&quot;. You don't &quot;have&quot; to run any dungeon if you don't want to, except if you want gear. And if you don't want gear, there's no point in running them. How does it change from Classic, except that you have a pool of 10 dungeons instead of max level ones (minus a few specs needing gear from low level dungeons)?<br />
And it's rich talking about running the same dungeons over and over when you long for a game from 15 year ago, whose dungeons most people ran more than their fair share, with no new content in sight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the point was there are a lot of systems in the current game that do &quot;force&quot; people to do certain content long past the time they would normally bother to. Last time I checked, admittedly a few months ago, tanks got bonuses for doing LFD runs.

<br />
The difference in Vanilla was you had to ask and find people willing to do it...often guild members...and while some found it tiring / boring they often helped out out of friendship or duty to the guild which usually lead to positive experience where your guild bonds were strengthened (paying it forward so speak) or you might meet new people and formed friendships. Nowadays, it's Blizzard and their incentives and tools that do the asking / finding for you but it's the same thing you said you hated in Vanilla...it's just hidden behind automation and incentives so you can turn a blind eye to it and claim you're not personally asking someone to do something they would rather not be doing</div></div><hr />

So apparently it was zone-wide before 1.9, went capital-wide in 1.9, then global in 1.11, then disabled by default in 1.11.2.<br />
Answer is then : global.<br />

Well obviously they encourage people to do old content, since it helps new players clear things (like heroics or LFR) and gives an incentive to roles in need to run that content. <br />
However if I need a +10 at the end of the week, my guild will probably help me, and maybe a kind soul bored enough to help. But it was exactly the same in Vanilla. <br />

Its not about recreating the exact experience of 15 years ago, that will never happen. Its about creating an experience as close to classic was originally. The argument stating the fact it wont be the exact experience means we should just throw everything out the window is absurd. Yes, there will be other addons that will be used that were not around during original vanilla. In a perfect world they would not exist either. But we have to pick our battles, some addons are more experience breaking than others. LFG is arguably the biggest community change to WoW, we're purposely trying not to make that mistake again.<br />

<br />
Dear frustrated noob, If you have an addon do all the work for you, making it easy and effortless to form groups. You also, by consequence lessen the focus on forming social bonds. Joining a group in vanilla was a social contract. If the group went well, you added the person to your friends list, so you wouldn't need to ever find randoms again. This also had the effect of somewhat improving your server reputation. Having an addon do this is impersonal and encourages using people as a temporary means to an end. <br />

<br />
It ain't the classic fans that are complaining about an addon such as this not working, you can count on that.<br />
Those who do enjoy classic knows just how important it is to have social interactions being the basis for grouping, instead of automation.<br />
<br />
One thing is certain, anyone who says they'll refuse to play classic due to this change, wouldn't enjoy classic much anyway. <br />
A large portion of the playerbase are so spoiled by QoL systems (well hey, a large part hasnt experienced WoW without them) that they need a written apology from the devs whenever something isn't able to be completed within 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
During the time I've leveled some characters to around 30 on a private realm trying to choose classes, I've added more players to my friendslists than I've had the last 5 years of retail WoW. Retail WoW is antisocial, does not organically encourage ingame bonds or friendships, and I am so happy Blizzard is keeping a close eye on classic addons that try to emulate QoL systems added since. Having to interact with people in order to join a group, having to gather at the instance portal, not being able to replace anyone within 3 minutes if someone leaves, does encourage tighter-knit groups. If there's investment in a group, you actually care.<br />
Being put in a group by an addon would do serious damage to classic. <br />
In BFA the damage has already been done long ago, and the rest of the game has followed suit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suppose a major part of why topics such as this can get so infected is that Classic and BFA can barely even be compared anymore.</div></div><hr />

It was not fun or engaging. I used to sit in a capital city for HOURS looking for a tank or healer. I'd rather sit in a queue while farming in the world. At least I'm doing something productive while I wait.<br />

Its one reason why we have LFD/R. <br />
<br />
Stating the obvious, but as someone who actually played Classic and sat for hours looking for someone to fill a spot because we didn't have enough guildies (or before I had a guild, in fact), it was a huge timesink I didn't want to deal with.<br />
<br />
The vocal minority's just shifted to people who think they know what they want.<br />
<br />
Exactly! Too many people with rose-colored glasses thinking it was great not being able to find a group are going to remember real quick why it was terrible, and they're probably going to quit Classic before anyone else.</div></div><hr />

You keep linking this as some sort of &quot;gotcha,&quot; when the reality is only a small subset of players used addons like this back in vanilla. Addons of all kinds are much more mainstream now, especially ones that aim to replicate QoL that retail has, and everyone will be trying to find and use them. The impact difference is not even remotely in the same league. Your argument is disingenuous at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The funniest shit is, in Vanilla the realm cap was 3k players, and later increased to 5k players. Classic is going to have 10-15k players per realm, and that after all the layers are removed. Probably 30k while layers are still in game.<br />
<br />
All the layers on a realm use the same chat.<br />
<br />
So 30k vs 3k. 10 times as many people using chat.<br />
<br />
Gonna laugh my ass off when people see how useless chat is going to be for forming groups.<br />

It is a &quot;gotchya&quot; when responding to all the nubasses that state that there were no LFG addons in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

Answer is then : global.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well obviously they encourage people to do old content, since it helps new players clear things (like heroics or LFR) and gives an incentive to roles in need to run that content. <br />
However if I need a +10 at the end of the week, my guild will probably help me, and maybe a kind soul bored enough to help. But it was exactly the same in Vanilla. <br />
Random people didn't spend 3 hours in Blackrock Depths out of kindness.<br />
<br />
you got the right answer on the Channel...the difference between patch 1.11 and 1.12 was you were automatically entered into the channel in 1.11 and in 1.12 you had to manually join the channel by typing /join LookingForGroup.<br />
<br />
on your other point we are closer to agreement than you may think..I'm just saying the same type of issues surround doing certain types of content at certain times in both versions of the game...just in Vanilla / Classic the process was manual (you had to do the asking / owe the favour) while in Retail Blizzard does it for you with a combination of incentives / LFG tools but the end result is the same - people are asked/bribed to do content they don't really need to do...the one benefit of the Classic system is that's it Server community only and you might actually meet new people and make new friends as opposed to the completely random and basically anonymous result you get through CRZ where you end up playing with people you may realistically never see again and who you didn't have to interact with while forming the group and thus are missing out on a very social element that was a significant part of the appeal of Vanilla (though admittedly some people hated it but that's what Retail for).</div></div><hr />

he's wrong...it was global in patch 1.11 and you were automatically enrolled in the channel when you joined the game. In patch 1.12 it they no longer automatically enrolled you in the channel you now had to do that manually by typing /join LookingForGroup. It was, however, still a global channel and remained that way until they took it out mid Wrath with the introduction of LFD.</div></div><hr />

This is a factually incorrect statement. If anything both the LFD and later the LFR expose what the real community. The community did itself in, all these features did was helped to expose what many had to endure and few like yourself got to largely ignore. Some people had their little clicks and niche groups of people and rarely strayed from them. <br />

When I started, I was not a good skilled player, frankly, I sucked. That opened the World of Warcraft at every level to me from the people that loved to cause problems and issues to the ego-driven people that we're incapable of extending a hand to a newer player. Throttbot was the best information at the time and it was at best incomplete. Asking questions of strangers in various chats led to being marginalized like some sort of plague. Course over the years of keeping an eye on these various chats, like trade chat, people got worse and far nastier over time. <br />

<br />
If anything the LFD exposed the shortcomings of the community. People only saw what they wanted to see, not what the bulk of people like myself had to largely endure from both sides spectrum. I became a better player over time, though at no point did I stop helping people that were mostly marginalized like when I first started to play WoW. I remember well how the guild leader, in my first guild, treated me in the first dungeon run and I have never forgotten how that felt ever since that was over 13 years ago. <br />
<br />
<br />
That dirtbag did me a favor, as a result of being a dickhead, I went looking for another guild. As it turned out the guild I joined was amazing it led me to join its sister guild as well. Which allowed me to help and interact with people of all stripes from questing and farming players to PVP, raiders, and dungeon grinders. Both guilds like many others were maxed out with people that helped one another out and were able to do so because they check their egos for the betterment of the guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Had it not been for both guilds I would not still be playing WoW today. I knew there were still good people playing, even though at every turn there was another in a long list of dirtbags to deal with in my path. No, the LFD is probably what saved many from continuing to play this game. The bulk of two guilds I mentioned were nothing more than a shell of their former selves by the end of Wrath. At the beginning of Cata, the leadership structure of both simply stopped playing. I eventually moved on to another realm and another one after that.

<br />
Besides, with a few exceptions many of the low-level dungeons simply are not worth doing unless you have all the quests and a solid group right at that moment. Itemization is all over the place in classic and often times a BoE green can easily fill the place of that shiny BoP blue for a few levels. Later on with UBRS, BRD (ony attunement), scholomance, and stratholme you might hit a snag depending on where the server is at progression wise, but people are always leveling alts and it shouldn't be too hard to find a group if you made any contacts leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'am not saying there weren't any douchbags back in the day. I don't even believe the amount douchbags has either increased or decreased since then. What I am saying is that because of how it was structured you cared an awful lot more about who you played with and how you wanted to be perceived. If you meet someone awful, you didn't want to play with them and took the necessary precautions to not do so. Just as you described. Lets say you found a good, smooth pug. Chances are someone in that group would suggest you should hit up another dungeon rather then go back to your capital to maybe to find a new group to join. If you teamed up with a bad healer you taught them how to play since the time it would take you to leave Shadowfang Keep to go back home to find a new one to bring back would probably take the same amount of time. You will remember that good, smooth pug, and the players you played with the next day, and they might bring another friend they found in another pug they did some night before. <br />
<br />
I played guildless for three expansions and this how I remember it. I can't remember ever having any issues finding groups with a large selection of friends. There sure were awful people in the game. But if you knew they were awful, chances are the people around you (or at least the people you cared about) thought so as well.</div></div><hr />

Why do you get such a hardon against people who prefer something you don‚Äôt? Do you feel threatened or something? You shouldn‚Äôt. BFA may have nothing going on but the next expac announcement will take the focus back to retail. Stop being a prick who gets joy from others mistery.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, mate. Developers are bluffing to calm down mob. They can't disable this addon, it's not possible. You'll be able to find groups for dungeons without that stupid spam which is apparently a cornerstone of socialization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I‚Äôve got friends who love retail, but it isn‚Äôt for me. And with classic here, I don‚Äôt know that it ever will be again<br />
<br />
I just dislike both.</div></div><hr />

The amount of clowns in denial like yourself on MMOchamp is what is truly adorable!!<br />
<br />
Upset that a garbage addon has been removed that AUTOMATES aspects of gameplay? LOL<br />
<br />
All these hilarious and jealous comments &quot;THEY'RE WEARING ROSE TINTED GOGGLES!!1&quot; as their precious BFA dies more and more. I wonder why your game is dying?<br />
<br />
You say watch what happens months down the line? - the drop off you speak of is all the BFA normie tourists who want trash addons like this. The sooner the drop off, the better.<br />
<br />
You zoomies need to just stay on your silly BFA and disconcern yourselves with real WoW.<br />
<br />
^ I give you all, the &quot;superior community&quot;, in a nutshell. And they wonder why they're met with animosity?</div></div><hr />

Classic is going to have 10-15k players per realm, and that after all the layers are removed. Probably 30k while layers are still in game.<br />
<br />
All the layers on a realm use the same chat.<br />
<br />
So 30k vs 3k. 10 times as many people using chat.<br />
<br />
Gonna laugh my ass off when people see how useless chat is going to be for forming groups.<br />
<br />
You make a good point about the realm population. Maybe that will make it easier to find tanks and healers. (crossing my fingers)</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that the addon was 100% made by someone intent on playing Classic. This notion that BfA players did done it, and to sabotage Classic no less, is just additional proof of how the &quot;Purists&quot; are more invested in being toxic than they are in playing the game. <br />
<br />
Sad to see, the release won't change squat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nfinitii</div><div class="date">2019-08-25, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, only add-ons that existed back then should be allowed now. If people want to play Classic they should actually have to play it.<br />
<br />
They r restricting addons greatly from what u could do back then. U had addons that could automate gameplay back then, those r no longer possible in classic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyrathius</div><div class="date">2019-08-25, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems kind of futile to me. Players are always going to try and figure out the most efficient way to make groups. If they can't do it with an addon they'll do it through Discord or something.</div></div><hr />

Good move on Blizzard for taking action. People need to stop trying to turn Classic into BFA, it destroys the entire point of making Classic servers in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you having a stroke or whats wrong your spelling?<br />
<br />
An addon like that existed back in vanilla, so having it in classic is &quot;keeping classic clean like it was the first time&quot;</div></div><hr />
