Beta PvP Gear Vendors<br />
If you are one of the lucky players in Beta, you can now purchase ilevel 483 Gladiator's gear from the PvP vendors on top of the Gate of the Setting Sun! For a full lit of the PvP gear, including the Monk PvP gear, check out WoWDB (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=%20Malevolent%20Gladiator%27s)! Wand spellpower values (http://www.wowdb.com/items/84899-malevolent-gladiators-baton-of-light) are accurate compared to what is displayed in game, but the value is very unlikely to be final.<br />

Rogue Class Design<br />
What annoying things have we had to deal with that you're fixing?<br />
I'll just use one example because in our opinion it's the biggest. Layered ramping mechanics were the single biggest weakness rogues have in Cataclysm (and have had for some time). Some ramping is desirable, but too much can really hurt target switching, prohibit fast burst damage, etc. (Don't take this to extremes -- we don't need posts from every class pointing out situations in which they can't go from 0 to 60 when target switching and therefore arguing how they need to be redesigned.)<br />
<br />
In Mists, we want combo points to be the ramping mechanic. Deadly Poison doesn't need to be a ramping mechanic. Bandit's Guile doesn't need to be a ramping mechanic. We changed the way both of those work.<br />
<br />
You may not have thought it was a problem, but we did, and we heard about it a lot from rogue players, so we fixed it. <br />
<br />
I sincerely want to know by what measure and according to what data you conclude rogues are &quot;fine&quot; in PvP right now.<br />
What I meant was that we didn't see any crippling design flaws in rogues that needed overhauling in Mists. Sub rogues probably are too good in Cataclysm PvP, or at least 3v3 Arenas, which many players use as synonymous with PvP. It's hard to tell if Assassination and Combat are really weak, or if Sub is so strong that any sensible rogue just plays Sub. It's also entirely possible that it isn't even Sub that is too powerful but just Prep and Shadowstep. In any case, my comment was addressed towards the group of players that believe rogues have this giant list of issues that must be addressed, and at another (perhaps overlapping) group of players that just want us to change things up for the rogue because they're getting bored. Sorry for any confusion.<br />
<br />
The combo points issue is a symbolic one, though. This is something a large number of rogues have wanted for a very long time, and the issue gets consistently ignored. I often feel as if there's no point in giving feedback at all when the devs can't even see eye-to-eye with players on how our resources should work.<br />
The feedback doesn't get ignored. We just disagree, which we have to be allowed to do if we're actually going to design the game rather than just letting players vote on how every mechanic should work. We like the way combo points work (meaning on the target). I also suspect you're being a bit presumptuous assuming that all rogues want combo points on the rogue. Yes, rogues would be easier to play if you didn't have to worry about which target your combo points were on. Do rogues need to be easier to play? If so, are combo points the right change? We could eliminate combo points and just give Eviscerate a cooldown. Would that be easier? Would it be more fun? I'm not trying to be dismissive -- I think those questions are legitimately hard to answer. <br />
<br />
A lot of people say killing spree is poorly designed because it doesn't work on those fights, but I firmly believe those situations are a failure of encounter design, not class design. Killing spree and backstab are fine; Blizz needs to learn to take them into account when they design bosses.<br />
We do. But it is not our design intent that every spec can perform the exact same rotation on every fight. I'm certain that if we solved the backstab issue then the next complaint to come up (from some class) would be that every boss fight needs to have 3 targets, because multi-dotting works the best with 3 targets and their DPS will be lower when there is only one target. What do you think the DPS difference is among the 3 rogue specs on Ultraxion? (You can't just look at posted logs to answer that question, because mostly what those logs tell you are that most rogues (and presumably many of the best ones) go Combat for that fight.) What is an acceptable difference? 5%? 1%? 0%?<br />
<br />
Obviously I don't have the numbers Blizzard does, but we do know that at least before the legendary daggers rogue was one of the least active classes. No matter if that remains true or not I think it says something when one of the, if not the best designed classes is also one of the least popular. It says that maybe it works great from a design standpoint, but how is that translating to the players? <br />
We look at those numbers of course, but it's really hard to determine cause and effect there. Paladins are nearly always the most played class, but there are just as many paladin players demanding change as there are rogue players (actually, given the population sizes, probably more). So why are some classes more popular than others? It's probably a mix of need, power, kit, flexibility, visuals and a host of other objective and subjective criteria. The hybrid vs. pure issue plays into that a little bit, but it's not the whole answer by a long shot. I definitely don't think it's as simple as if we make a bunch of changes to rogue rotations, now more players will play rogues (consider for starters that we'd almost certainly lose some rogues as well). <br />
<br />
I agree that this is how the design should be, but this raises the question of whether or not our finishers are powerful enough to warrant this design decision. Compared to the power we lost by having the crit bonuses of our primary abilities taken away, they just don't feel like they're as strong as they should be right now. There are fewer combo points flowing in due to generating talents being taken away, so the gaps between finishers feel unrewarding because the finishers themselves feel unrewarding.<br />
I think it's safe to say that if we find we need to buff rogue damage for any of the specs that we'd look to finishers as a place to increase damage.<br />
<br />
My big problem right now is that I feel very similar to feral druids and Windwalker monks, without the added benefit of being able to radically change my gameplay on a spec switch. I don't need that radical change, I suppose, being a pure DPS. In PvP it's not a problem as I feel very much like a rogue there, but it's hard to translate into PvE and I end up feeling like a warrior in leather that attacks a bit faster.<br />
I hope Windwalkers feel different. Cat druids were designed from the outset to play like rogues, the same way Bears were designed to play just like warriors. We've eroded that a bit over time, but the bones of it remain.<br />
<br />
As far as the pure vs. hybrid thing goes, that is a really tricky problem to solve. We could turn all classes into hybrids of course, though I'm also not sure every player would rejoice at such a change. It has been very challenging to make pure specs play fundamentally differently. If the Mists warlocks work out well, then they may feel pretty different (of course they also run the risk I mentioned before of feeling like 3 separate classes and not like warlocks). Some players in this thread mentioned that mages play totally differently, but I think to be fair they feel more different than they really play because fire vs. frost vs. arcane is such a strong theme. It's harder for &quot;I'm an assassination&quot; to have a completely different feel from &quot;I'm a swasbuckler&quot; or &quot;I'm a sneaky guy.&quot; We've had the same challenge with hunters. Presumably Marksman hunters are great at using ranged weapons. Okay, what does that mean for Survival? They use traps? Melee? Poison?<br />
<br />
Also, a lot of our skills are kind of boring and could use just an aesthetic change. Edit: Oh, the actual question is: Is updating rogue animations and making them more unique especially across specs on the table?<br />
I think that's a totally fair criticism, especially of rogues and to a lesser extent warriors. Melee classes just have fewer opportunities for very showy visuals. We could add them anyway, but then the classes feel like they're casting spells and aren't doing melee attacks with weapons. That said, we have tried to give rogues a few great-looking visual effects in Mists. Longer term (meaning it's unlikely for Mists) we'd like to do more with character animation so that all rogue attacks aren't using the same one-handed stab motion (Mutilate at least has its own animation). Historically, player animations have taken us a very long time, and that time only gets worse as we add races. However, for Mists we have some new techniques that let the animators apply the animation from one model more easily to another. It still takes a great amount of time -- just less than it did before. It is most easy to see the benefits of this advance in all of the new animations for the monk class. It's too early to call that technique a success, but assuming it is, we could do the same thing for rogues and warriors and have a lot more variety in the attack animations. (Animation in this sense has a very specific jargony term, which is the movement of the model itself. All of the spell effects are a different system generally handled by a different team of artists.)<br />
<br />
Then why did you make changes to rogue rotations? This is what people are complaining about. Go play Assassination on live and then go play it on beta at 85, then come back and tell us that Assassination is more fun without Puncturing Wounds and Ruthlessness.<br />
Puncturing Wounds is just crit. We can add more crit if we need too (like we recently did for warriors), but it also risks making crit unattractive at high gear levels. &quot;Why did those stupid designers put crit on rogue gear? Don't they know we don't value it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Puncturing Wounds (through Seal Fate) and Ruthlessness can deliver more CPs, but also contribute a lot to getting stuck at 4 CPs, which is something rogues have complained to us about, because it means you need to do a weak finisher or risk overflowing CPs on your next Mutilate. In Mists, Assassination does fewer finishers, but at the same time we introduced the Blindside proc to help the rotation from feeling too static. <br />
<br />
To use one of my soon to be patented bad analogies; I feel like every expansion is kind of like Winterveil (to not alienate anyone) and all the classes are opening their gifts to see what this expansion is going to bring them. Some are getting entire new mechanics, some are getting new flashy spells and skills, but rogues are getting Auntie Maven's sweater for the 5th time. Sure it's gonna keep you warm and get you by, but you kinda knew you were going to get it and it's certainly not flashy or exciting. <br />
I honestly believe this is one of those grass is greener deals though. As someone who receives class feedback from both barrels (not that I'm complaining), nearly every class argues that they got a lump of coal and the other guy got something awesome. You'll see a few players saying some new ability or talent is awesome, though they'll do so quietly for fear that we think they are content. In fact, I would challenge you to name those classes and specs (not counting monk) that you think got a really good deal in Mists. They'll be here in a second defending their argument that a new spell might appear flashy or sexy but it has Serious Issues or the Real Issues Have Not Been Addressed.<br />
<br />
That probably sounds cynical, and I'm honestly not a cynical guy, but it's also what we've come to expect. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/226861-rogue/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5794630014?page=3#59))<br />

SWTOR Going Free to Play?<br />
It definitely isn't set in stone yet, but SWTOR might be going free to play in the future! After announcing that the game will be free to play until level 15 and allowing free server transfers, lead designer Emmanuel Lusinchi had some interesting things to say in an interview (http://www.gamestm.co.uk/discuss/star-wars-the-old-republic-we-are-looking-at-free-to-play-says-lead-designer/)! <br />
<br />
I think it’s more than the free-to-play model – it’s more that there is a lot of competitive offers. If it was just free-to-play games and they weren’t very good it wouldn’t even be a question but there are definitely good games out there and good games coming out, so of course all of this competition impacts your plan with what you want to do.<br />
<br />
Asked whether it would be feasible to adapt The Old Republic to a free-to-play model, Lusinchi coyly suggests that the wheels may be in motion for a drastic change.<br />
The MMO market is very dynamic and we need to be dynamic as well. Unless people are happy with what they have, they are constantly demanding updates, new modes and situations. So we are looking at free-to-play but I can’t tell you in much detail. We have to be flexible and adapt to what is going on.</div></div><hr />

Oh. My. God.<br />
<br />
I just might racechange all my non-DK/Paladin characters to female Pandaren.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
And regarding SWTOR going F2P until level 15? Not news. WoW's been F2P till 20 for nearly a year now, and Rift's also done the same thing about 4-5 months ago. In fact I wouldn't even call it &quot;F2P Till (low level cap)&quot;, just a never-ending game demo. Not really that game-changing/breaking.<br />
<br />
However, what WOULD qualify as game-changing is if SWTOR went FULL F2P. That would definately be worthy of being deigned as 'drastic change' as noted in that snippet there. But knowing that EA would be looking over such a transition, SWTOR wouldn't just go F2P, but it'd likely wind up being Pay-to-Win horsecrap.<br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />

Let's see how great of an idea that is, to kertow to the wims of all players who whine, when 95% of any given game community is chock full of screaming entitlement babies going on about &quot;I WANT STUFF FURST&quot; and &quot;IF I GET IT I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO GET IT&quot; and see how long that keeps 10 million+ subscribers around when you start going back to making content for maybe 100,000 players to ever enjoy while the rest get jack shit (generally the loudest whiners I see in regards to WoW).<br />

<br />
I doubt it'll go full F2P. Not yet, anyways. <br />
<br />
Rift's managed to hang on this far for a year and it has a FRACTION of SWTOR's subscriptions. Last checked, they had 240,000 and dropping (noted back in March), which is slightly slower player loss than the rate Warhammer Online had (keep in mind that a lot of Mythic's devs went to Trion to help make Rift). Trion's reacting to the loss of subscriptions differently too; instead of sticking with their 'release content rapidly' model, they're going to lump up a bunch of update content into an expansion and sell that box to whomever's still around to care.<br />
<br />
Then they'll likely dump the majority of their dev resources to their &quot;Defiance&quot; MMO/TV Drama Series hybrid they're doing with 'SyFy' channel.<br />
<br />
Subscription-based MMOs are just a really hard sell in a time where its target demographic are still trying to scramble around finding new jobs. That's what the last year's really said about the MMO market, really.<br />
<br />
I mean, look what 38 Studios just went through in the last month. They dropped millions of dollars to try to become Blizzard in a year (where it took Blizzard decades to become) and it blew out the whole studio, gutted by the state government of Rhode Island. It takes stupid luck or stunning innovation/uniqueness for large-scale MMOs to take off and be popular.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you're right. Blizzard is not to have fun, nor are they allowed to make a joke. If they make a joke, then Pandaren are most definitely an April Fool's joke, and the game is a joke. Never mind the fact that you're playing a fantasy game in which you are mailed dragons. Or talking to walking walruses. Or what is basically a minotaur. I agree. /sigh <br />
<br />
And, since I'm sure it will be brought up, I haven't played in 6+ months. No, not because it is a joke, it sucks, etc. But because I've been playing the same game for 5+ years straight. It's a testament to the game itself.</div></div><hr />

LOL. Hilarious. Sad to say it had a lot of potential, but for the enormous budget it had, it definitely felt very empty. There was next to no features among a slew of other problems with the game. Maybe next time they won't try and listen to the &quot;wow haters&quot;. This isn't BC anymore where there were no features and everyone had to sit in a city and spam.

Where was the saracasm? I'm being serious.<br />
<br />
What if it's not. What if it's a singular joke? What if it's not a joke expansion at all? Isn't it supposed to be about war, about Alliance vs. Horde? But because it involves &quot;kung-fu pandas&quot;, it's a joke? Obligatory &quot;beta is beta&quot; comment. The &quot;om nom nom&quot; could very well be a placeholder, and I've no idea what the &quot;red&quot; is doing in the dialog box. To me, if this was anyone but Chaud or Boub, I would say it's fake. It wouldn't be difficult to fake a dialog like that and pass it off as fact. <br />
<br />
So, yeah. Since &quot;every where you look, it's one silly thing after another&quot;, please state the numerous things that are jokes. I'll be waiting. And even IF they are silly jokes, so what? Who cares? Why must the game, who is being played by 10+ million players, be super serious, and conform to what YOU what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is something that really annoys me as well. There've been so many threads on the beta forums asking why there's no face variety, and no replies whatsoever. I like what they did to the model, it's great, and all these hairstyles, wonderful, but why can't there be variety? Right now all the female pandaren look like the same individual with a different &quot;paint job.&quot; <br />
<br />
What I'd really like to see would be diffent -individuals-. A more pissed off looking pandaren, maybe, or an older looking one. Just.. yeah.. variety, please. :3</div></div><hr />

Not news. WoW's been F2P till 20 for nearly a year now, and Rift's also done the same thing about 4-5 months ago. In fact I wouldn't even call it &quot;F2P Till (low level cap)&quot;, just a never-ending game demo. Not really that game-changing/breaking.<br />
<br />
However, what WOULD qualify as game-changing is if SWTOR went FULL F2P. That would definately be worthy of being deigned as 'drastic change' as noted in that snippet there. But knowing that EA would be looking over such a transition, SWTOR wouldn't just go F2P, but it'd likely wind up being Pay-to-Win horsecrap.<br />
<br />
We'll see.<br />
Worth noting: They could make it so you pay money for the install/account, but no actual sub (i.e. B2P), and then put in a convenience/vanity-items-only cash shop. This is exactly what GW2 will be doing, and other games have done similar models without making it &quot;pay to win&quot; in the past.</div></div><hr />

To listen to media is dumb, since they're spending time with the game at most a week or less, but listening to your loyal customers can sometimes turn out to be a good idea. Now ofc, you have to filter like an idiot to get to a proper nice suggestion or idea how to change or balance something, but there people who understand the game just as well if not better as developers. <br />
<br />
id Software comes to mind with the Quake series and Quake 3 especially, where the community made quite a few suggestions &amp; changes in from of competitive mods OSP/CPMA which made it into the official point releases (patches) later, and from which the community only gained benefits. If they didn't listen to the community and mod authors, Quake 3 Arena wouldn't have been as popular as it was/is. Same goes for other companies who value their playerbase like Valve and even Blizzard. <br />
<br />
As said, you have to filter through a lot of shit, but some players might know what they talk about, and ofc a MMO is harder to balance as a generic FPS, but some people have it down to understand and see what the problem is and how to fix it, and those people should be heard and their ideas at least considered to be privately tested by Blizzard.<br />

Worth noting: They could make it so you pay money for the install/account, but no actual sub (i.e. B2P), and then put in a convenience/vanity-items-only cash shop. This is exactly what GW2 will be doing, and other games have done similar models without making it &quot;pay to win&quot; in the past.<br />
<br />
Well, considering GuildWars is not really an MMO aside from the HUB City part and ends up being more like a Diablo game where you only roam with your party or solo, they have less server hardware to worry about and potentially less bandwidth to cover. Diablo 3 is also not sub based, cause there is a ton less costs to run the server as for a true MMO for example, so yes it makes sense for GuildWars to be B2P, and rest being free with micro transactions or DLC as it's popular today. If GuildWars had a sub, nobody would play it. <br />
<br />
Don't really follow GuildWars 2 much, but I guess it's the same principle as GuildWars 1, hub with losts of players, roam out of the hub, you only see people that are in your party, equals not an MMO.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Design by popular vote is the surest way to stop innovation and fresh ideas, as well as steering the product away from an overall stratety in favour of short-sighted opportunist moves, because the mob will always go for what it already has, and always tend to prefer the conservative option (while hypocritically claiming to want the opposite), or possibly the option that sounds most alluring regardless f long time consequences.

You build it, and people will come - if they like what has been built.<br />
Or they don't come, and you build something else and try again.<br />
Most likely though, you build it, and if it is good, some people will come, some won't. That's the nature of creation.<br />
<br />
Asking &quot;hey guys, do you have any ideas for us that we can build for you&quot; might work, but mostly as a publicity stunt. You hardly ever get a usueful result from that. If someone out there actually did have a brilliant idea, they would already be working on it themselves.</div></div><hr />

Come on, WoW has never been completely serious. It wouldn't be WoW if it was.<br />
<br />
I'll bite on this.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a game, it's meant to be fun, and WoW has always been on the lighthearted side, but there has been an increasing violation of a very simple rule that many immersive players, including myself, live by:<br />
<br />
If my character is going to be the butt of a joke, in a situation that I am paying to be entertained, it should be as I choose it, when I choose it, to a degree that I choose it.<br />
<br />
Having an entire expansion with an opening aesthetic of &quot;duh-huh-yuck, bouncy drunks y'all&quot; goes too far. The only way to correct an opening presentation like that is to OVER-correct it, which would likely involve an uncomfortable swerve toward the depressing that is even less appealing.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, this is all opinion, and exists all in personal subjectivity and I am not entitled to demand Blizzard angle their game to appeal to me in a way that will make me want to immerse in this chapter of their story...<br />
<br />
But they're not entitled to my money, either.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't even make sense, specially applied to a game.<br />
<br />
Of course they should not design the game exclusively with what ideas players voice. However, some of the ideas the players do create are really good, and the fact they listed it doesn't mean it isn't creative. Not every WoW player is in a position to be working on their own MMOs and implementing such ideas there.<br />
<br />
For instance, on the beta forums, there is a rogue that suggested lvl 90 Rogue talents being about modifying your Smoke bomb, and all of the effects are very creative. To assume he could just be working on a MMO of his own and not share the idea just because it's a good one is silly at best.</div></div><hr />

It's not just ideas but also fun that needs to be taken into account. I am all for interesting gameplay but when it becomes high maintenance, it's no longer fun. Blizzard seem to be making that mistake at the moment with some classes getting complete overhauls and others becoming more of a pain to play. Same rotation, same problems, etc. I am not talking about topping the meters day in and day out. I am talking about the playability. More and more fight designs involve target switching, AOE, burst, etc. Some specs really suffer at some of these to the extent that they feel almost useless. If you don't get to do anything different and feel like a passenger every fight, that's no fun.</div></div><hr />

Rift's managed to hang on this far for a year and it has a FRACTION of SWTOR's subscriptions. Last checked, they had 240,000 and dropping (noted back in March), which is slightly slower player loss than the rate Warhammer Online had (keep in mind that a lot of Mythic's devs went to Trion to help make Rift). Trion's reacting to the loss of subscriptions differently too; instead of sticking with their 'release content rapidly' model, they're going to lump up a bunch of update content into an expansion and sell that box to whomever's still around to care.<br />
<br />
Then they'll likely dump the majority of their dev resources to their &quot;Defiance&quot; MMO/TV Drama Series hybrid they're doing with 'SyFy' channel.<br />
<br />
Subscription-based MMOs are just a really hard sell in a time where its target demographic are still trying to scramble around finding new jobs. That's what the last year's really said about the MMO market, really.<br />
<br />
I mean, look what 38 Studios just went through in the last month. They dropped millions of dollars to try to become Blizzard in a year (where it took Blizzard decades to become) and it blew out the whole studio, gutted by the state government of Rhode Island. It takes stupid luck or stunning innovation/uniqueness for large-scale MMOs to take off and be popular.<br />
<br />
Where exactly do you get this 240,000 figure from. Trion isn't a public company and I've never read them releasing how many subscribers they have (and they don't need to either). So I'm interested in your source.</div></div><hr />

Wrong! This is not SP game, where devs can really do anything they want. In MMO playerbase is very important one and if the game want to be successful, devs do need to listen. It is dev's job to filter good, bad and ugly ones, to evolve the game and giving players more, better and different choices.<br />
<br />
What I do find really surprising is that in WoW devs are actually removing choices in the name of &quot;normalization&quot;. That is just bad for the game, in the long run, regardless of the fact that WoW already lasted its course for many &quot;old&quot; players.</div></div><hr />

Linear, terrible pvp, terrible planets, dead worlds, no reason to go back to planets at level 50, horrible &quot;crafting&quot;, 0 world pvp, heck you can't even try to sack a opposing planet, I could go on forever.<br />

I don't feel the game is really worthy of a subscription fee due to the fact that it feels like an rpg not an mmo. When you get to 50 and beat your class story line, you feel as if you beat the game. I think that if swtor does go FTP or even B2P it would give bioware alot more time to implement features without the drastic bleeding of subs.

Gee-ZUS. Yeah, the white-stripe through the hair is REAL childish, when you can use that to make them look old. Also, I think you can choose the hair-stripe to match the natural hair color so you don't HAVE to have one. Also, for last freaking time;<br />

I'm starting to think people who are bitchin'-and-moanin' about this expansion are doing it JUST for the sake of complaining. This is one of the most.. visual appealing, story oriented, non grim-dark-stupid expansions we've had, and pays the most homeage to 'Vanilla' than the others. Maybe the fact that we don't have Metzen'd mary-sue characters is why people are so bitchy, or that things aren't being torn apart and destroyed.. Oh well. I'm sure once the expansion actually comes out, the bitchers will whip right around, as usual, and say how great it is. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's a game, it's meant to be fun, and WoW has always been on the lighthearted side, but there has been an increasing violation of a very simple rule that many immersive players, including myself, live by:<br />
<br />
If my character is going to be the butt of a joke, in a situation that I am paying to be entertained, it should be as I choose it, when I choose it, to a degree that I choose it.<br />
<br />
You won't, more than you've always been.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having an entire expansion with an opening aesthetic of &quot;duh-huh-yuck, bouncy drunks y'all&quot; goes too far. The only way to correct an opening presentation like that is to OVER-correct it, which would likely involve an uncomfortable swerve toward the depressing that is even less appealing.<br />
<br />
The pandaren starting zone is actually far more serious than, say, the goblin one.<br />
<br />
That's that taken care of, enjoy.</div></div><hr />

A fantastic, neutral website. <br />

They haven't updated in a while, though, but I think that's mostly because some MMO companies have been ..... well relunctant to release their data lately.<br />

There'll likely be an update when Q2 is over (end of June/start of July). Companies eventually have to answer to their shareholders whether they like it or not.<br />

C rating – Some of the datapoints may come from official or other reliable sources, many of the datapoints come from estimates, third party sources, unclear official sources or other indirect information.<br />

That's for Rift. In other words, why should I believe their sources when Trion doesn't release numbers themselves.<br />

Playing PVE is incredibly frustrating for rogues in Beta (and it doesn't look like they'll change much before Mists goes live). I am not good enough at PVP to comment there, but I am awesome at PVE and in Beta, I'm just not. Every single mob is like a mini boss fight when I'm soloing.

Got some evidence that's why people left? No? Not going to attribute anything to other titles coming out and stealing playerbase numbers? Or the fact that Mike Morhaime himself stated that people are consuming content faster than ever before as a relation to why subscriber numbers are falling? Or the fact that content got really easy again and numbers are still falling? No?<br />
<br />
<br />
But one important thing to point out, and Mr. Morhaime touched on this as well, is that World of Warcraft's subscriber base does not change linearly. It fluctuates based on content consumption, which players seem to be doing a whole lot of -- at a more rapid pace -- with Cataclysm. &quot;Subscriber levels have decreased faster than previous expansions,&quot; he said.<br />

While some of his answers fell into the same rhetoric we're used to hearing, that doesn't surprise me since many people continue to rephrase questions that have already been essentially answered in the past. Even counting those, though, I didn't see such a rapid succession to make someone sick. <br />
<br />
5 detailed posts from the Lead Systems Designer personally answering player concerns, even if the questions were cherry picked, is actually an impressive amount of developer feedback, to me.<br />
<br />
No, they're strawmen. Not all of them, but many:<br />
<br />
&quot;We could eliminate combo points and just give Eviscerate a cooldown. Would that be easier?&quot; - In response to people wanting combo points on the player, something that has no direct meaning to making the class easier to play, it's a quality of life issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think the DPS difference is among the 3 rogue specs on Ultraxion?&quot; - In response to people wanting to play their class properly on all fights, nothing to do with equating dps across the specs.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact, I would challenge you to name those classes and specs (not counting monk) that you think got a really good deal in Mists&quot; - In response to rogues claiming they feel left out on the fun new ability side of things, completing disregarding the question or offering counterexample and just redirecting attention on to other classes.</div></div><hr />

So it's MMO Champs fault this TOR news is negative? Has there actually been much good TOR news lately?<br />
<br />
I think TOR going F2P just over 6 months after its release, after the amount of time it was in development, after the amount of money spent making it (most expensive MMO to made wasn't it?), is a bit bigger news than WoW going down from 12 million to 10.2 million subscriptions (still like 9x more subs than TOR has) and 6 chinese servers being merged.<br />
<br />
And this is a World of Warcraft Community/Fan Site that sometimes posts about other games and has forums for other games, and you're surprised it posts loads of WoW related news? Negative WoW news has been posted loads before. Not sure what to think...</div></div><hr />

Newsflash, Blizzard designs the game their way. All 10 million of us players are along for the ride. Don't like it? Don't play. Want to complain? It'll fall on deaf ears unless it's an actual problem and a sizable chunk of players complain about it too. &quot;Sizable chunk&quot; means tens of thousands of players, not half your guild or almost everyone on your friends list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking strictly from a PVE POV: ENH shamans are getting a wonderful deal: we're no longer gonna be out of half the gear we could use because it has the dread Crit/Haste combo (while those are still our two worst stats, the gap is much smaller, haste and crit both have solid, real uses) plus all mail gear could have Expertise now since Hunters will use it). We get a speed boost seperate from our ghost wolves, our fire pet totem now build Searing Flame stacks so it's back as a CD, we get two new ones (Windwalk totem and Ascendence), and honestly, all 3 level 90 abilities are pretty damned powerful for us. Our DPS feels on target. A good ENH shaman now will be much more valuable in Mugushan Vaults then he is in Demon Soul.<br />

As a mainly WoW-focused site, we have seen both good and bad news in the front page, many times.

Just cause they are doing free char transfer and its free to 15 doesn't mean it will be going to f2p. Look at Rift they still offer free char transfer and its free to 20 and they have been at it for a year plus now and from my experience i enjoy rift much more then wow or swtor.

^ This. You sound a little butt-hurt they announced it. I played the game for a little while and it's not even that good imo, you might enjoy it and that's fine but thats no reason to go and get angry because they posted the possibility of F2P.</div></div><hr />

I admit I absolutely hate that it's nearly impossible to find groups for stuff. But, I'm a big fan of Bioware's games, so the storyline really has me hooked right now. I also don't give a rat's behind about raiding in this or any game, so that's a moot point.<br />
<br />
Essentially, SWTOR is a single-player RPG that you can play with someone else. It's pretty much just my husband and me plugging along through quests, and we're happy with it.<br />
<br />
Also, they didn't say they definitely were going F2P any time soon. Someday? Probably. But it sounds like people are acting like they're going F2P very soon.<br />
<br />
*shrug* I dunno, I still give them $15 and I still have fun with it. And no, I never played Star Wars Galaxies. :)<br />
<br />
I am just pretty tired of WoW at this point. I've played since Vanilla. At first I was excited about MoP, but now the thought of questing again, trying to level up, just...bleh. I suppose that's why I like SWTOR. Even if it's still an MMO deep down, at least it's different than what I've been playing for the past seven years.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm a loser. Oh well. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm happy that WoW is beginning to embrace it's own light-hearted nature - we all knew that's what it was, when it came down to it. It will never have the grungy grit of some games, nor the stark, no-bullhockey realism of some others. In truth, the aesthetic we've come to love (or at least accept) of this game is one that is vibrant, colorful, and even cartoon-like at times, and any motion towards accepting and accentuating that unique WoW aesthetic is a good thing in my opinion. None of these things make the game childish, or the content or themes therein less mature, or valuable, and I'd even venture to say that anyone who thinks otherwise is likely, themselves, immature.</div></div><hr />

Darn i hate replies like this. I know it's annoying to sift trough all the replies in this topic, but...<br />
The whole system is changing regarding heroics. Have you done them on beta or live yet? Also who is to say that the language is not a placeholder?<br />
Also, probably 0.001% of the playerbase actually uses their racial language? I haven't seen someone use taurahe or gutterspeak since wotlk in my guild/friends group.</div></div><hr />

If it was just free-to-play games and they weren’t very good it wouldn’t even be a question but there are definitely good games out there and good games coming out, so of course all of this competition impacts your plan with what you want to do.<br />
<br />
Asked whether it would be feasible to adapt The Old Republic to a free-to-play model, Lusinchi coyly suggests that the wheels may be in motion for a drastic change.<br />
The MMO market is very dynamic and we need to be dynamic as well. Unless people are happy with what they have, they are constantly demanding updates, new modes and situations. So we are looking at free-to-play but I can’t tell you in much detail. We have to be flexible and adapt to what is going on.<br />
<br />
For how long they think they can stay alienated and ignore players and STILL in business? Those guys really need to check the meaning of &quot;LISTENING&quot;.</div></div><hr />

What on earth are you jabbering on about? People are purely saying TOR might go Free2play because they mentioned they are looking into it in an official post. No one ever said WoW will become free, not once. Your post was complete jibberish.</div></div><hr />

For this to work they will probably have to pull a GRAVITY (http://www.ragnarokonline.com/) in it, and make SWTOR a franchise where they sell the rights to open third-part servers around the world.</div></div><hr />

Its not that they dont listen. They see what people write. They just don't really care that much. Blizzard has decided that they want you to play their game in a certain way. Never mind that you are paying for it and it might be possible that you don't want to play it that way. It's part of the bigger disconnect in which players ask for a way to customize there equipment and instead of getting what players actually wanted they got this convoluted over blown transmogrification garbage. It's also part of why a zillion people have left the game and will probably continue too. This coming from a person who does still enjoy the game mostly.</div></div><hr />

Other people are paying for it too. Believe it or not, your 15 dollars a month is not covering 100% of their production costs. Blizzard does what it thinks is best for it's user base, not what's most popular. Are they always right about their decisions? No. But I have no clue why some people persist in their delusion that for 15 dollars a month they should have a mult-imillion dollar game tailored to their exact specifications.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't be surprised if SWTOR went F2P, it's lost loads of subs and doing terrible for something that was labelled a &quot;wow killer&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Same, just couldn't get into it. Didn't even have the drive to get to level 50, it just got so boring to me. I know someone in real life who has like 3 50's though, so he seems to have found pleasure in the game. I guess he'll be happy if it goes free2play, although I then guess it'll be very micro transaction based and I don't think he'll like that ^^</div></div><hr />

None of that surprises me one god damned bit. What does surprise and disappoint me is that the people who run this website felt it was news worth putting on the front page. I long ago accepted the principle that &quot;mmo&quot; champion was really a Blizzard fan site. Hell they give more information about non mmo games (diablo 3)than they do about actual mmo games (world of warcraft withstanding). From that I expected that all the changes swtor would go through over the past couple of months would be largely ignored. What disappoints me however is that they (much like the rest of the gaming media) latched onto this story as gospel when they can't properly site or source it. When the barest amount of research done on their part would show it's false and frankly when they've ignored every other piece of swtor related news up until this point. I am left to wonder about the standards and intellectual honesty and objectivity of the people who run this website. I always held them to a higher standard personally but boub and sunshine have clearly failed at this. I would ask it be taken down from the front page but at this point it's rather moot. It will disappear and die off just like the news of SWTORS impending f2p will. Hell UO is old as the hills and it's still a sub model.</div></div><hr />
