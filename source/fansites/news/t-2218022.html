So, I have the Merc Buff but I zoned in Horde side. Is it not possible to go merc for Warsong Scramble? <br />
Correct. Mercenary Mode does not apply to PvP Brawls. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/859955137032278019))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
As someone who played very very little WoW yet interested in its class design can you explain the design of the Rogue combo system?<br />
They use a resource (energy) which regenerates over short time frames. So it’s possible to go all out, but have enough resources to be able to push buttons again in a relatively short time (compared to say mana). We always liked this design because it’s very easy for rotations to fall into a pattern of “you must always push X when it is on cooldown.” Energy regeneration adds an extra wrinkle to this discussion.<br />
<br />
Then, there are basically two kinds of abilities. Things that generate combo points and things that consume combo points to cause big damage. It has that satisfying feel of pulling something off (much like a fighting game combo), can deliver high burst moments (which feels very rogue-like), but also has the similar benefit of energy in that you have a reason to use both kinds of attacks rather than always just spamming the same button over and over.<br />
<br />
Rogues had (maybe still have) the added nuance that the combo points are on the target (not on the rogue), so you can’t just switch targets at a moment’s notice (which has interesting nuance for PvE and PvP). Sometimes it’s worth sticking to your current target until you can pull off a finisher. Other times, it’s worth abandoning those.<br />
<br />
I have often said that I think rogues had the best designed resource system in WoW, but that we didn’t want to just copy that for every other class, or it might feel less special.<br />
<br />
As with any WoW answer, my info might be very out of date. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/160282117618/as-someone-who-played-very-very-little-wow-yet))<br />

ESPN has an article (http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/19347153/teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league-due-high-cost-undesirable-contract-terms) stating that Blizzard is struggling to sign franchises for the Overwatch league due to unfavorable terms. Blizzard released a statement (https://esports.yahoo.com/blizzard-officially-responds-overwatch-league-rumors-190546691.html) to say that things are going well and someone may be trying to spread misinformation for bargaining reasons. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is a $20 million franchise fee<br />
Teams are not guaranteed revenue sharing until after 2021 and only if Blizzard meets certain criteria<br />
If a team sells its spot to another party, the league would receive 25 percent of the proceeds<br />
<br />

There's a big, big difference between being greedy and being laughed right out of the door. Activision Blizzard needs to shed a million or 19 off that price. LoL is the biggest esport out there and it only has like a $1.8 mil buy in I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is the $20 million being reported as fact? ATVI hasn't released information yet about it.<br />
<br />
In fact, a different article even said this:<br />
<br />
&quot;According to Sports Business Journal, owners looking to pick up a team are going to have to shell out a significant chunk of change, however. Their report claims that smaller market owners will have to drop $2 million to $5 million, with spots in Los Angeles potentially costing as much as $15 million.&quot;<br />
<br />
Poor reporting for MMO-C...</div></div><hr />

I agree. Also if there was any question if the vid is staged, the number crunching gives it away. Being staged doesn't take away from how great it is though.</div></div><hr />

For better or worse, it's one of WoW's early defining moments as it relates to the game's place in a larger cultural context.<br />

Actually, it just sounds like you're being overly critical. This reference is familiar to a vast majority of online gamers, and even a significant number of people who haven't even played MMORPGs. Recognizing that it's been 12 years since the video was released is likely nostalgic for most of the player base, as it was for me. I've never stuck with any game as long as I've stuck with WoW, so being reminded of something as far-reaching as Leeroy Jenkins is absolutely welcome. If they want to acknowledge anniversaries of other similarly memorable moments in the game, I welcome it.<br />
<br />
You not liking the story doesn't, by default, make it a &quot;slow news day&quot;, nor is this strictly a &quot;news&quot; website so it really doesn't matter... at all. Go find some other website to be hyper-critical of. (To be honest, your comments make it sound like you simply weren't around when this happened, and you're bitter about being left out or ignorant of the details. But don't worry, this is where you &quot;correct&quot; me by saying how you WERE there, and it's just dumb to bring it up again.)</div></div><hr />

If by this comment you're trying to say the crapstorm that is vanilla was good and the current game incarnation is bad you are wearing some thick-ass rose tinted shades my friend or did you forget the stumbling baby steps of the game with the most awful raid design, terrible group content, painful world questing, a slapped together pseudo-pvp system (that's still basically just an afterthought/minigame) and one of the worst trait ability systems I've seen of any launch title (if you've forgotten it essentially invalidated two thirds of the specs).</div></div><hr />

Blizzard needs to decouple PvP in WoW and make it it's own game (think of it in terms of HotS).<br />
<br />
Warcraft Conquest<br />
<br />
Game Modes<br />
- [3v3] Arena (VS AI + Random + Ranked)<br />
- Battlegrounds (VS AI + Random + Ranked)*<br />
- Siege (VS AI + Random + Ranked)*<br />
- Event Map**<br />
<br />
*Battlegrounds will be the smaller BGs found in WoW, Siege will be the larger battlegrounds<br />
**The event map would be massive scale month long battles, like original Alterac Valley<br />
<br />
Collection<br />
- Skins (different skin colours, faces, hair styles, hair colours, etc.)<br />
- Transmog (armor sets and weapon sets)<br />
- Mounts<br />
- Tabards and Banners<br />
- Sprays<br />
- Announcers<br />
- Emojis<br />
- Portraits<br />
- Stimpacks<br />
<br />
Collection items would come from loot chests that are awarded for leveling different heroes and your overall account<br />
<br />
Heroes<br />
- Each Race and Gender has a default skin<br />
- Each class has default gear<br />
- Every specialization in WoW will be it's own 'hero' and will have similar talent trees to the game allowing for more customization<br />
<br />
Classes can be individually balanced and have more streamlined but core skillsets comparative to WoW because this would be it's own game</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overwatch may be growing as a game, but as an e-sport it's pretty much dead in the water. If an investor was looking for making an e-sport team why would they pay $20 million and choose Overwatch which has relatively small e-sport scene when they can just choose to go for games like CS:GO, Dota or LOL for fraction of that money and those games have huge and well established scenes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are we playing the same game?<br />
<br />
Overwatch has seen a steady decline, with only small bumps up with big patches. <br />
<br />
I don't know a single person who actively plays it, when I had ~50 or so people play it in beta and when it first came out on my friends list. The hype just isn't there for a game with such a stagnant meta.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, nobody cares about Overwatch E-Sports, the skill ceiling just isn't there to make matches exciting. OW is basically TF2 with less aiming and more abilities to make you &quot;feel&quot; like you're accomplishing more, but the skill ceiling is just lowered. Same reason why HotS will never have a big E-Sports scene. <br />
<br />
Why is Blizzard even making &quot;casual&quot; games and then trying to make them an E-Sport, it makes no sense. Choose a market.</div></div><hr />

No. <br />
<br />
Practically no one does pvp inside the game, when all it takes at this point is one press of a button to que into something. <br />
If you make WoW pvp a separate game aka another dumb moba style game in an already saturated moba market...Not one single wow player will log out of wow just to play it. It might attract some HoTs tryhards, but that's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was clearly fake. A bunch of them were wearing spaulders of valor which dropped well after the whelps part. Also leeroy himself had a weapon that dropped off a later boss in the same dungeon. <br />
<br />
Also they talk about using divine intervention on the mages for aoe. In vanilla wow Divine intervention would kill the paladin to shield another player and remove them from combat. While the mage was DI'd they wouldnt have been able to move or cast or anything. <br />
<br />
Also why is the pov guy running around pulling extra mobs and breaking more eggs. Made zero sense. They all pulled extra mobs to make it look like more of a shit show. <br />
<br />
It was funny but it was clearly staged</div></div><hr />

i was thinking that too, its pretty , but it doesn't hold interest really for too long, i think fighting games have a better chance at a wider audience because its easier to tell what is going on, look at starcraft 2 , it only went so far at its basically the korean national sport , i think hearthstone, of any of their games has a better chance at gaining public success <br />
<br />
just my 2 pennies, i think e-sports still has alot of growing up to do, regardless of the front end polish<br />

pvp in wow was an after thought, and its not very fun considering that the classes and their abilities are very lop - sided. i never got into pvp just because of how painful it was , HotS is clearly the game wow pvp was meant to be, wow pvp will always be popular to a handful of people, but thats about it</div></div><hr />

Finishers costs both energy _and_ combo points. (Burst restriction. Idea not carried over to other classes with same system AFAIK)<br />
Talents return energy on an rng basis when there was a non-rng over-time mathematically equivalent. (Frustration. Idea not carried over to other classes with same system AFAIK.)<br />
Combo points restricted to one single target. That was the most counter-intuitive thing I experienced when I started playing the game. (They didn't even bother fixing it for other classes with same system, they just gave the points to the player itself.)<br />
Over-shooting on combo-points (in those cases where you couldn't help going from less than 5 to more than 5) penalized you by simply dropping your extra points. (Fixed for other classes with same system but even today rogues have to pay for more or less half-baked fixes.)</div></div><hr />

The '20 million fee' figure circulating around the web is fake. Here is the important bit about what Blizzard said about this (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-pro-gaming-league-reportedly-struggling/1100-6449978/): &quot;Finally, it's important to think twice about statements from unnamed sources, who may try to leverage the media to deliberately spread misinformation as bargaining tactics or for other competitive reasons.&quot;</div></div><hr />
