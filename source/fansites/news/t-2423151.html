This is something that we're testing carefully, and probably won't be finished and available to put into the live game until later this week. I'll let you know as soon as we have final numbers, and I'll post about it a final time when it goes live.<br />

<br />
By logical means, most played classes are addressed first, the complain numbers amount for priorities.<br />
<br />
And Warlocks are just as popular as Shamans, so hold on tight.</div></div><hr />

Druids as a class are absolutely ridiculous in PvP atm,it's suicidal to attempt to fight one 1v1</div></div><hr />

Nobody really cares about lvl 112 stuff</div></div><hr />

with 4 targets they have 25k dps , it's pretty good</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I totally agree that Feral needs buffs, you can't compare DPS at different levels, because of how ratings scale with level (eg, 20 crit rating gives more crit at 110 than at 120). I was definitely doing more damage at 110 than I am now at 120.</div></div><hr />
