Nope, still class specific. They'll be tagged like class specific armor is tagged.</div></div><hr />

More like the daze removal clearly belongs in the standard feature category due to no flying...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did. And your post is so much better than all of those.<br />
<br />
But back on topic, why don't they just remove daze all together?<br />
<br />
I plan on having the stables regardless, but if we're going to be forced to the ground for an entire expansion then why don't they just remove that annoying mechanic all together? <br />
<br />
It's just one of those things where people may or may not notice, but if you're giving the option for EVERYONE to have it, then why not just make it baseline for the greater good?<br />
<br />
At the very least make the perk account-wide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a pretty horrible horse model to be fair. They really need to go out and see what a horse's legs actually look like and how they move. You know, like they did for their new sound files in MoP..... Their artists could benefit from such a thing. As a horse owner it positively drives me nuts how horribly incorrect the legs are on the horse models.</div></div><hr />

I really don't get why it's not allowed in my country. We got plenty of companys who give you rewards for canvassing a new customer.<br />

The RAF system is counted as a pyramid scheme in many European countries(even the official pvp tournaments is counted as that in my country) , because legislation is outdated and lazy.</div></div><hr />

It uses the same skeleton as the celestial steed, invincible, and tyrael's charger. I'm not trying to cry rehashed stuff, I'm just saying that I prefer the other horse skeletons. Look at how the headless horseman's mount moves through the air in comparison to any of the flying pony mounts.</div></div><hr />

Just because it doesn't look like your horse doesn't mean that these horse models aren't modeled after real horses. Like all animals, there are many different kinds.. Look up Ardennes horse. Minus the neck up, those horses look rather similar to the models. I'm sure the modelers know how to use references.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the reused Invincible horse model, and Invincible was a flying undead horse which - in lore - died after its legs were broken in a riding accident. That's why the legs move in that weird flopping about way, the bones are broken. Sadly, every horse which uses Invincible's skeleton will also have stupid looking legs for this reason.</div></div><hr />

I had forgotten that little bit of lore. Thanks for the reminder. It's still annoying, but now it's more just me wishing they'd make a not broken horse skeleton.</div></div><hr />

Video game.... fantasy.... not reality.... OK ?<br />
