This Tuesday, February 9, at 3:00 p.m. PST, tune in live at Twitch.tv/Warcraft (http://twitch.tv/Warcraft) to watch several top World of Warcraft streamers, YouTubers, and personalities from Europe and North America race against the clock—and each other—in some of the new max-level dungeons coming in World of Warcraft: Legion.<br />
<br />
Our two teams will be racing through two dungeons: The Maw of Souls, a brand-new dungeon not yet available in the Legion Alpha, and the Heroic difficulty version of Halls of Valor, home of the greatest warriors of the vrykul. While these teams have had some practice with Halls of Valor on lower difficulty, this will be the first time any adventurer has set foot in The Maw of Souls—all these two teams know is to expect the unexpected!<br />
<br />
For this challenge, we’ve assembled a colossal collection of some of the biggest names in the World of Warcraft community. Representing Europe: Treckie (http://blizz.ly/1nzvJIO), Bellular (http://blizz.ly/1OQCGxJ), Qelric (http://blizz.ly/1ROJhN1), and Alex and Loz of FatbossTV (http://blizz.ly/1ROJjEr). To face off against them, representing North America: Towelliee (http://blizz.ly/1NC7Sg0), Killars (http://blizz.ly/1Us1mON), Monkioh (http://blizz.ly/1QtK7LI), and Tattva and Tovo of Line of Sight Gaming (http://blizz.ly/1PTWw97). Both of these teams have a ton of experience, knowledge, and history with World of Warcraft—but will it be enough to triumph?<br />
<br />
Assistant Game Director Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas will join Community Manager Josh “Lore” Allen to provide commentary and insight as each team fights through the dungeons in a race to earn the fastest time possible. The winning team will claim victory not only for themselves, but for the region they represent!<br />
<br />
We’ll have all of the action live at Twitch.tv/Warcraft this Tuesday, February 9 at 3:00 p.m. PST (check here (http://blizz.ly/1RPLVSC) to find that in your local time zone). We’ll see you there!</div></div><hr />

Nice little distraction I guess? &quot;I have a great idea... Let's have a race through this unfinished, buggy content, with limited available spec/classes.&quot; Just get the game done and stop with this hype crap.. Want people to be excited about the game? Then how about you give normal people the chance to do something like this. Give a huge wave of beta invites.. Do SOMEthing other than hype and marking BS.

Developers can teleport players in, so no new build is necessary. That doesn't mean there won't be one though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alternatively, think of it as Blizzard being so confident in that the dungeons are actually playable that they are willing to market this out to show not only their progress but also provide a bit of fun. Also, the developers will also be looking at this and making improvements based on the results.<br />
<br />
Also, you realise that the development team have absolutely nothing to do with this and that this is being organised by Blizzard's marketing and community departments, right, you know, while the development team are still working on the stuff that needs to be done in the background?<br />

<br />
Yeah, because a huge wave of beta invites to be used by a bunch of people who have absolutely no interest in actually testing the game, reporting bugs and are just using it as an early access to the game has really helped in the past, hasn't it? You just want your own invite and don't actually care how many others have an invite, do you?</div></div><hr />

Also, where the blue post says &quot;Tuesday, February 9 at 3:00 p.m. PST (check here to find that in your local time zone)&quot; - the link on the word &quot;here&quot; is wrong. It converts the timezone for you but changes the day to Monday rather than Tuesday.<br />

Don't think he would have made a difference, NA is pretty good. Monkioh is a healer for Midwinter so at least they evened out the squads with two high level raiders. Killars is also in a top guild.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking EU will take this competition, I'm not super-familiar with all the streamers listed but I think Bellular is solid and Towelliee is generally weak so I'm basing my decision on that.<br />

I think the reason Preach isn't on is that I get the impression he was out of town or something last week so he may just missed the invite. <br />

we will be lucky if beta will start in may in this pace of marketing over content<br />
<br />
Hey now, they did say the beta would be coming in the weeks following Blizzcon and as of right now it's 13 weeks. When it does come out it will still be weeks. Hell 3000 weeks still counts. Right? And they did say at the end of the year, we just don't know which year.</div></div><hr />

Here we see the elusive casual wow player. If we listen we can hear their natural mating call. &quot;I don't want to put in any effort but I want all the benefits of putting in effort&quot; <br />
<br />
His mating call is an effort to attract Blizzard. He hopes that he may receive free things he isn't entitled to. <br />
<br />
After several hours of trying he gives up. His mating calls fall deaf ears. <br />
<br />
<br />
On a serious note. They do beta invites differently. Mop beta you could pay blizzard for a year and get beta invite. I don't remember if they did anything special for wod. But for legion they're doing early testing with streamers for marketing and they're trying inviting top raiders. The reason they went for top raiders is that they are more likely to a) actually test the game and not just play it. Intentionally try to do weird things or break the game. B) Their feedback will generally be of higher quality as they see the games mechanics in a different light.</div></div><hr />

Must have missed the part where he made it sound like streamers are privileged which means they received something without earning it. Streamers may not be the most skilled players. But what they do takes a lot of work. It's not as simple as he makes it seem. Then he goes on about how you have to raid 24/7 and you get free stuff(alpha invites) again making it seem like it's just a simple easy thing to do. <br />
<br />
These statements are dripping with self entitlement. Hence why I said what I did. He doesn't want to put in the effort and reap the rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does Blizzard really need player input for an alpha test? No, not really ;/ So who should in theory get alpha invites? Noone.<br />
<br />
Who should get beta invites though? EVERYONE. Making either exclusive to social media or high end raiders for a marketing purpose is a mistake and a foolish one at that. <br />
<br />
I don't stream nor raid for vanity so I havn't &quot;earned&quot; the chance to give my input? Why do we even need to EARN a chance to make Blizzards product better.. what the actual hell is wrong with you people.</div></div><hr />

I love this response because it's just so jackass. <br />
<br />
Sorry, but it really is. <br />
<br />
For over ten years now we've had people complaining over and over about how obtuse and opaque Blizzard is. Now they are finally opening up a bit and striking a balance between the beta tests of old and the new pay-for-play betas that are the result of Kickstarter and other crowd-funding sources. <br />
<br />
We're seeing work process, changes weekly and the beta access is being used by the marketing arm of Blizzard in order to build hype. <br />
<br />
It's a brilliant marketing campaign, very little overhead - even with this event I'm not sure they are paying the streamers, it'll be up to them to disclose or not, I'm hoping they do - and it's bringing views to the core audience as well as people who may have left the game and just tune in to see people be entertaining. <br />
<br />
I won't be tuning in to the stream but I'm really looking forward to the full-cut available on Youtube.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TyrannicalPuppy</div><div class="date">2016-02-04, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, because a huge wave of beta invites to be used by a bunch of people who have absolutely no interest in actually testing the game, reporting bugs and are just using it as an early access to the game has really helped in the past, hasn't it? You just want your own invite and don't actually care how many others have an invite, do you?<br />
<br />
Except that's exactly what's happening in the alpha right now. There are SCORES of people that don't understand what &quot;alpha&quot; means going in an complaining when things aren't working, including some streamers who shouldn't even have been given access after rage-quitting like chumps.</div></div><hr />

Actually I have played every spec now available and logged them and enjoyed them too! Healed as well /shudder. Nice finally after 11 years doing something other then tanking. Obviously tanking in the expansion but learning and widening my knowledge of other specs so far has been fun!<br />

True story, he's been doing it all. Some better than others and some with a few OH SHIT moments but it's been pretty entertaining to see. Good to break out of the one trick pony that is tanking now and then.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sime</div><div class="date">2016-02-04, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's rather sad that Blizzard actually thinks these guys are collectivly what all players are thinking of the game. I for one have never been a fanboy and don't at all think that the current system of top guilds being alpha testers and saying this and that is what will make legion good..<br />
IMHO as back in vanilla people looked up to players with this and that gear. (currently its all from raiding) but back in vanilla being a top raider wasnt just to buy a 100 boost and get back in with old top guild friends.. It meant you had to prepare for a month or more to actually GET into the raid... questlines and keys and Rep grinds to be able to enter. Thats what made it awesome. Not just having the best top players that could raid 7 days a week. <br />
<br />
I dont know how many people i've met that just login to do raids and then never do anything else ingame... Thats what all this gets. players that just login and enter a instance, there hasnt been proper world content in ages. its all about raids and dungeons now... Legion will probably be the same and i am still not a fanboy of this page due to this simple fact, I would like a filter to not show alpha/beta/PTR stuff, cause honestly if the product isnt done, i dont want to know about it... Fallout 4 kind of became best due to this fact, they had 0 feedback from players (not even the right kind of players)-.. Blizzard is just too scared to disapoint players now and its better to get 50% of the players that will buy legion for sure, then to risk it and have less. Knowledge is power and power is money. But it does not make a good game anymore.<br />
This is why we have LFR now... (ooh i dont want to interact with people, i just want loots and to see the Raids).... WELL back in the day you had to TALK to people, you had to be a nice person to get into the raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Streamers are chosen for one reason above all others- free advertising for Legion.<br />
<br />
There are some great streamers that should get alpha invites because they are capable of providing logical feedback- even when their emotions are involved. I have no issue with them and I watch them a few nights a week.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also knows many players who have given level headed and great feedback for over a decade in previous alphas, betas, PTRs, and live patches. Blizzard is ignoring most of those players in lieu of free marketing.<br />
<br />
Again-- what are Blizzard's plans for Legion's content patches? Finding Legendaries ala Timeless Isle 3.0? One raid? No more new dungeons- just harder versions of the ones launched with the expansion? More Timewalking Dungeons- except this time- WoD dungeons weekends?</div></div><hr />

You know you are talking about the guy who when doing the Arms spec video didn't bother to read out the talent heroic strike and see that it's now a static waiting buff for certain abilities?

Makes perfect sense to select some of these people who've given back to the game through guides and blogs for the testing. I don't know all the names, but Fat Boss guides are one of my go-to sources for concise, clear, and easy-to-follow information.

C'mon. Blizzard made a HUGE buy into eSport last year. They want to expand into eSports in a bad way, and this is the first toe in the water towards whatever they have planned. <br />

This is no coincidence, or random event. This is part of a bigger marketing and business plan for eSports. This is how they make WoW into an eSport - raid racing. <br />

<br />
I'd totally watch a raid/dungeon race provided a couple things: <br />
<br />
1) Blizzard spectator mode, so I can pause, rewind and view back everything from the perspectives I choose. <br />
<br />
2) Normalized gear. Everyone who goes in gets the same gear type and level. Basically take away the gear-improvement mini-game from the instance, sure it may require some bosses to even be downtuned from where they are in even say mythic given no mythic rings and all, but I want it to go NASCAR, make it about the raiders. Take away all the arm-chair quaterbacking and remove the &quot;well if I had their gear&quot; excuse.<br />
<br />
3) Normalize add-ons. Specific UI addons would need to be vetted by Blizz, any additional ones would automatically be disabled. I really think removing tell-me-when from a lot of folks would cripple them. <br />
<br />
4) Give it a separate currency that can be used for highest level raiding gear as well as cosmetic gear that no one can get unless they go through these. <br />
<br />
All that would make it an accessible and level playing field which is what any sport requires.</div></div><hr />

Okay, CM are a thing, but I surely miss the time where you got faster through dungeons by correct execution of kill priorities and CC than mass-pulls and AOE. *sigh* <br />

I guess, if the gear is that crappy compared to the large chunk of raid gear that follows dungeons, and the low replayability, most people just want to get through as soon as possible, which is a pity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think Towellie is bad, he's just considerate of those who rely on him; an artefact of when he started playing. He doesn't rush with a &quot;fuck the healer&quot; attitude, and wants his teammates to get as easy a run of it as possible. When I'm tanking randoms, I pull one group at a time, face everything away from the group and cycle through in order to hit everything with single target attacks - I started tanking during the Burning Crusade where that was the bare minimum expectation of a tank, and those habits have stuck.<br />
<br />
The newer generation of tanks have been trained to charge in, unleash all their AoE, and then move to the next pack with six mobs following them and half the instance strung out like a line of fucking washing. When the wipe happens because the healer had the audacity to loot a pack and fall behind, said tank usually chews him out and then rage quits.<br />
<br />
I know what I prefer.</div></div><hr />

The reason they went for top raiders is that they are more likely to a) actually test the game and not just play it. Intentionally try to do weird things or break the game. B) Their feedback will generally be of higher quality as they see the games mechanics in a different light.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to burst your bubble but top raiders were always in testing from start....and all they do is preparing for their world first race.<br />
Mastering the changes of chars they play and recording test raids so they can write weak aura's etc etc for it.<br />
<br />
That is something completely different as testing &quot;for the general people&quot; , they do report big bugs as they can't use them anyway but for the rest they are only there for themselves.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'm comfortable with those who live and breathe the game getting a few extra perks for their loyalty and commitment. Sure, it's frustrating to never get into a World of Warcraft testing schedule when I have a lot to say; but arguing that I should get the same preferred treatment as someone who plays constantly, develops content for the community, and provides a platform to discuss the game is (in my view) little more than shallow entitlement.<br />

I mean why should the guys/gals who promote the game get a chance at alpha. Should you just play in the super bowl because you have not earned it.

You need to understand where these people are coming from. While sure, we don't raid mythic or stream a lot of us, we still pay the same sub as the mythic raiders and streamers, and despite not doing the same thing they do, we can and will play for the same amount of time (I log on daily to rock BGs and arenas for a few hours, for instance). The fact that they're getting to play what Blizzard is essentially marketing to be new content, alpha or not, while the rest of the playerbase is stuck with the already-monotonous non-content 6.2 has left us with (again, non-raiders), is frankly a little irritating.</div></div><hr />

Thought you guys had freedom? Or does that only apply to the successful people? Sad excuse by the way. We've got 4 weeks of paid vacation each year (at least in Sweden), some spend it in the summer, some use it to progress new raid tiers, nothing special really.<br />
<br />
Point is moot anyway, this excuse that US is more casual is insulting to the guys that actually raid hardcore in the US.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
How do one explain the wonder that is the EU dominance over US in PVE raiding? One can assume it's about social acceptance or something similar. Otherwise US have more advantages overall, the language being one obvious thing (you have no idea how frustrating it can be to have some russian guy shouting in broken english), the other being that you actually get a head start on every content. I don't think it can be pinned down to player numbers either, the US isn't just for people living inside THE USA, thinking so is in itself kinda ignorant. Despite that i do think that the numbers are pretty even.<br />
<br />
Nah i think it's more of a social thing, i don't think you'd want to use ur days off in the US to go hunt dragons. In EU, at least where i'm from, people would wanna know how it went.</div></div><hr />

I talked about the domination concept of each region and feel that in content, as a lot of things, it comes total time sacrificed for your goal. If you have more time in total between the players participating, you should have a natural higher curve for success imo, reps equal experience. I would imagine then that when you get to the stacked teams in each region who share similar hours of play per day for example we then see talent take over and win out. Several teams leaders have communicated such in the past of this curve. I find the secrecy, the planning and the sacrifice of these teams amazing personally.

This is a fun exhibition. This isn't Paragon/Serenity/Method vs Limit/Midwinter/NA etc. We are just community guys who got asked to be in a fun race to show some dungeons and Heroic Modes. TWO literally two people are handling this from Blizzards end. Not even Devs mind you. No hours were taken away from precious 7.0/8.0 development. No one is taking breaks and days off to get 2 5 man groups to run a dungeon.<br />
<br />
People need to get with the times in my honest opinion. As much as this is a passion to be playing games as a career it is also a business. And companies look to people to promote their game. No offense but they don't go to random players with 3/4 viewers or players who have been playing &quot;since beta&quot; to live stream a fun event. Yeah it's harsh to say it but that is me. I bring reality to situations. I won't sugar coat it. We are not being paid as streamers/YouTubers/community advocates to do this. They asked us and we just said HELL YEAH this is gonna be fun. <br />
<br />
It is hard watching from the outside in. Being that guy or gal who doesn't have Alpha having to be asked to come watch random nerds do a dungeon you CAN'T do. The fact is you can not please everyone. Blizzard can't give every single person Alpha/Beta or else they WOULD if they could. No one knows what goes on behind the scenes and the reasoning for not inviting 2 million players lets say. It could be not enough people to go over data, not enough tech available. (yes yes I know billion dollar company blah blah)<br />
<br />
Yes people are upset at WoD, yes people are mad they don't have Alpha and community people have it cause they can showcase the game. Yes the internet is angry and we must rise up our pitch forks to be able to take down this juggernaut! Look my opinion. Sit back watch 2 teams be bad. (US mainly) and try to understand the reality of most situations. Emotions always get in the way. Understandable.</div></div><hr />

People need to get with the times in my honest opinion. As much as this is a passion to be playing games as a career it is also a business. And companies look to people to promote their game. No offense but they don't go to random players with 3/4 viewers or players who have been playing &quot;since beta&quot; to live stream a fun event. Yeah it's harsh to say it but that is me. I bring reality to situations. I won't sugar coat it. We are not being paid as streamers/YouTubers/community advocates to do this. They asked us and we just said HELL YEAH this is gonna be fun. <br />
<br />
It is hard watching from the outside in. Being that guy or gal who doesn't have Alpha having to be asked to come watch random nerds do a dungeon you CAN'T do. The fact is you can not please everyone. Blizzard can't give every single person Alpha/Beta or else they WOULD if they could. No one knows what goes on behind the scenes and the reasoning for not inviting 2 million players lets say. It could be not enough people to go over data, not enough tech available. (yes yes I know billion dollar company blah blah)<br />
<br />
Yes people are upset at WoD, yes people are mad they don't have Alpha and community people have it cause they can showcase the game. Yes the internet is angry and we must rise up our pitch forks to be able to take down this juggernaut! Look my opinion. Sit back watch 2 teams be bad. (US mainly) and try to understand the reality of most situations. Emotions always get in the way. Understandable.<br />

Hey, look! More not-so-subtle &quot;nya nya i have alpha access and you do-ooon't!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ever heard of open beta? Simple concept, really, and lots of companies do it. Alpha should be in-doors QA and beta should be open.</div></div><hr />

I will leave this wonderful thread with this. <br />
<br />
This is a fun exhibition. This isn't Paragon/Serenity/Method vs Limit/Midwinter/NA etc. We are just community guys who got asked to be in a fun race to show some dungeons and Heroic Modes. TWO literally two people are handling this from Blizzards end. Not even Devs mind you. No hours were taken away from precious 7.0/8.0 development. No one is taking breaks and days off to get 2 5 man groups to run a dungeon.<br />

I wouldn't take much stock in someone that plays video games for a living. Maybe get a real job? I bet you get cringely embarrassed when you finally get a date and meet her parents and they ask what you do for a living. I bet you lie. I bet she dreads bringing you over because of it. Anyways, have fun on your race lol.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to go saying it's that easy (but, come on, the only real difficult part is getting enough money for a good mic and webcam and video capturing software, and getting enough traction to jumpstart your channel with loyal viewers that can get your more viewers), but making 6-7 figures for it is absolutely fucking ridiculous. Six figures, you're already making more money than most teachers and hard labourers, not to mention people in other forms of entertainment (radio hosts, news casters, sportscasters, et cetera), and going to seven, you'd be making more money than most fucking doctors and lawyers, people who actually give back to the world in some meaningful way by either saving peoples' fucking lives or preventing the innocent from going to jail over being framed for crimes.<br />
<br />
Get off your goddamn ivory tower. Regardless of how &quot;hard&quot; it is, you don't deserve multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars for screaming into a camera for a bunch of brown-nosing sycophants. And I'm not even going to get started on &quot;charity&quot; streams.<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to get technical, it's not a real job since you've got no 401k or any form of healthcare benefits, nor do you have anything to fall back on should the popularity of video game streaming suddenly drop off.</div></div><hr />

If it's that easy, you try and do it for a while and we'll see how it goes :) You guys are sounding just like the general noob tbh &quot;This is unfair, and they are OP. That's easy to do.&quot; and then when it all comes down you couldn't even do the same easy thing even if your life depended on it. Get good and learn to love yourself, that way you won't have to be bothered with how others are living their lives. PEACE</div></div><hr />

You seem to forget the important part of youtubers/streamers/etc..<br />
Appeal and luck.<br />
You cannot just &quot;buy a good mic and cam and start making money&quot;.<br />
For every 3 streamers who can make a living from it, there are another 3000 not earning a shit.<br />
Same as musicians, actors, writers..<br />
It's not all up to you.</div></div><hr />

All right there mate, just completely ignore the actual fucking point of my reply and just cherry-pick the part that'll let you wave your fucking cock in my face like a condescending twat. Good show mate, good show. <br />
<br />
I'm in broadcasting school, right. Shit's hardly different than streaming, save for the medium of entertainment and the subject matter. And yet when I graduate, I know full-well I'll be going into a business where I'll be lucky to get a placement making more than minimum wage to entertain arguably a far more vast audience than most Twitch streamers ever reach. So do tell me, why do they deserve hundreds of thousands of dollars to scream like spastic chimps in front of a camera for brainless nobbends like yourself? Spoiler alert: they don't. But Twitch pays them out the fucking arse... for what? Just because they can? Like Towlie the Towel said, someone who gets an average of 100 viewers per stream, someone who would for all intents and purposes be considered an unpopular streamer, is making 5 figures. The other forms of entertainment I mentioned get that much with TENS of thousands tuned in to them daily. Not the mention some of the absurdly high donations some of the bigger streamers get.<br />
<br />
Funny that you need to come to his defense, since he seems to suddenly be too much of a coward to defend himself anymore.<br />
<br />
Learn some objective reasoning skills and stop cherry-picking to jerk your own ego. PEATHE.<br />

Appeal and luck matter in all forms of entertainment, and yet streamers are still making an arseload of money.<br />
<br />
You don't need to make the comparison to musicians, because I've experienced this firsthand in high school. And let me tell you, the biggest reason for that is the fact that a) most of those musicians write music that isn't commercially appealing and thus don't get picked up by record labels, or if they do, because of the aformentioned luck, they fail to get traction and a sustainable fanbase. The musicians who can't write for shyte don't get shows.</div></div><hr />

Races in an alpha with unfinished, untuned, classes(some of which are missing entire specs) doing unfinished, untested, probably buggy as all get out dungeons? And this is very clearly detracting from development time on what is turning out to be a rather late releasing expansion pack with no sign of content for months to come, when you have a fairly big shot developer himself providing commentary. Not to mention all the time and resources it would take to organize this.<br />
<br />
It just seems odd to me.<br />
