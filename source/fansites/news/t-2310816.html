Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
BlizzCon draws near, and we wanted to give you an update about Diablo’s presence at the show. Last year at BlizzCon, we kicked off Diablo’s 20th anniversary by announcing the old-school cathedral dungeon (if you missed that the first time around, it’s coming back in January) and unveiling Rise of the Necromancer. This year, we want to give you a heads-up that while Diablo will be on the show floor, we won’t be making any new Diablo announcements. There will be a time for that at some point in the future, but that time is not now.<br />
<br />
However, in addition to the special BlizzCon Diablo III in-game reward, we’ll also have Diablo panels for attendees and Virtual Ticket holders, and, as always, we look forward to a weekend filled with fun and revelry with the heroes who call Sanctuary home.<br />
<br />
Patch 2.6.1 is on the horizon. Looking beyond that, we’re hard at work on the future of Diablo and exploring what’s next for the franchise. Please be patient. Our passion for Sanctuary burns as bright as the High Heavens and as hot as the Burning Hells—and we’re excited to hunker down and get working!<br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />
The Diablo Development Team<br />
<br />

In Remembrance: The Harvest Festival Has Arrived<br />
The yearly Harvest Festival is now underway in Azeroth. This is a solemn time when the Alliance honors Uther the Lightbringer by lighting a candle at his tomb in the Western Plaguelands, while members of the Horde show their respect to Grommash Hellscream by leaving a bottle of spirits at the base of the Hellscream Memorial in Demon Fall Canyon in Ashenvale.<br />
<br />
To commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives to help friends and allies, feasts are also held outside Ironforge and Orgrimmar in honor of these fallen heroes.<br />
<br />
When: September 29–October 6<br />
<br />
Where: Outside of Ironforge and Orgrimmar<br />
<br />
This year, worgen, goblin, and pandaren now have unique tributes available to them in the quest, “Honoring a Hero.” All Harvest Festival foods also provide 4% health per tick.<br />
<br />

Shadowcaster Voruun<br />
Hey all,<br />
<br />
I have some answers on this now - Shadowcaster Voruun will spawn like all other Argus rares - i.e. he has a chance of being a daily World Quest, and he can also spawn as a rare every time the Argus rares cycle (every four hours).<br />
<br />
What we resolved with Voruun was an issue that was preventing him from spawning in general, and, now that that is resolved, he will definitely be making appearances in the future. Just to stress this - while he may not be up immediately, he should now be spawning much, much more often going forward.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your patience while we got this sorted out today! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1073310-shadowcaster-voruun-spawn-times/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759376437?page=17#328))<br />
<br />
Human and Blood Elf Shaman<br />
I don't think it's about their culture not being &quot;primitive&quot;, it's more that when you play a Human or a Blood Elf, or any other race for that matter, your character comes from a specific &quot;faction&quot; within that race. This lends them the ability to choose what they want to &quot;be&quot; when they grow up, but only insofar as what that particular society offers.<br />
<br />
Playable Humans are always from the nation of Stormwind. Playable Blood Elves are always from Silvermoon. While it's possible for there to be &quot;break aways&quot; in the story and for members of those races to join &quot;opposing factions&quot; and learn new skills, that's not something that's on offer to player characters.<br />
<br />
If those classes were ever added to those races, I would expect specific backstory to be created for how those races adopted those techniques and rituals, such as with gnome hunters &quot;creating&quot; and taming mechanical beasts.

<br />
You can infer from their message that they're working on something Diablo-related, but it's too soon to say if they will consider the project successful enough to release it (re: Titan). Hopefully it's not a Diablo mobile app, but they're clearly keeping whatever it is a secret for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They make a TON of money vs. the effort involved for Hearthstone. It is one of their highest margin games, if not the highest. That team is one of the smaller teams, and they make quite a bit of money. So that is not going to stop, and it doesn't really take anything away from the other development teams either (they're not growing the Hearthstone team at the expense of other teams as far as I know), so I wouldn't worry about it.<br />
I can never get a good sense of how much money they make on HotS, I imagine it barely scrapes by with a profit because they never make a big deal about it in their quarterly reports. The main downside to this game is that it uses graphic designers that could be used on other projects (Blizzard is always complaining about not having enough art asset creation resources - it has been used as an excuse in WoW for sure).<br />
<br />
And to your last point, if they're working on Diablo4, it will definitely be quite a few years before we see anything about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW went through 2 patches with 430 days of nothing, Diablo 3 didn't have that long of a drought I believe. (yes I know reaper of souls is 3.5 years old now)<br />
<br />
Now I know the franchise needs some new life into it, outside of just class DLC (druid?). Sometimes a game company is just working on something bigger that takes longer then 2-3 years, you know, it took 11 years between diablo 2 and 3?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably higher chance for Warcraft 3 remastered as they got a Warcraft 3 PTR still running, despite it being obscure and not updated/advertised very much. <br />
<br />
It still is a big overhaul to get new life into the game, they rebalanced a lot of the maps and items.<br />
<br />
Also Warcraft 3 and TFT recently got a new installer, so they might eventually put it on the bnet app, and you can also swap from Reign of Chaos to Frozen Throne in 1 button press in game.</div></div><hr />

Do you not bother to think before you make a stupid comment? We already have Hearthstone on mobile.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really hope they're working on new Diablo 4, or at very least new D3 expansion. Long overdue for one.<br />

AND FOR LOVE OF GOD PLEASE ADD Warcraft/Diablo/Starcraft skins to OverWatch!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's obvious they've put Diablo into Maintenance mode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode). TBH they doomed D3 with that horrible, horrible release, delayed PVP, RMAH, etc. Yeah, D3 got much better later on, but the damage was already done. If you screw up badly on release, then it doesn't matter what you do to fix it as the player base will have already moved on.</div></div><hr />

My littlest complain is the Destiny 2 avis included. Considering how much of a fail D2 is<br />
<br />
You do know Destiny 2 is not a Blizzard game right? They have nothing to do with it besides hosing it on the Blizzard launcher. No reason, other than the launcher, for it to be at BlizzCon at all.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. D3 was terrible. Hope they bury everything they established with that shit and make a clean cut for 4.<br />
Also an HD version of D2 would be nice. I still play that from time to time with mods like PlugY.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
And please no more of this nephalem/chosen crap. <br />
A good hero doesn't need to be some crazy demon- angle- hybrid bullshit but a normal man who overcomes his limits.<br />
I really hate this &quot;it's your destiny&quot; nonsense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes it sound they don't even know what big thing they will develop next, meaning the next D3 expansion or D4 would be in 3-6 years at the earliest.</div></div><hr />

I really hope they're working on new Diablo 4, or at very least new D3 expansion. Long overdue for one.<br />
<br />
AND FOR LOVE OF GOD PLEASE ADD Warcraft/Diablo/Starcraft skins to OverWatch!<br />

Its probably going to be something like that.</div></div><hr />

If this is the end of D3, as it would seem, then I thank you Blizzard for the thousands of hours I put into the from vanilla all the way through to the Rise of the Necromancer.

I hope all the best for the future projects and I hope you guys will make good use of all the failures and successes that occurred during D3's life. Thanks for D3 and I hope there's more Diablo in the future!</div></div><hr />

While i adore D3 and feel it is far superior that D2 and lightyears ahead of competition and abomination which is PoE im gonna disagree. <br />
<br />
People play what they want. If they dont want play D3 it is because of something. Same as blizz shuting it down - because of something. We also not obligated to say blizzard what we like or dont like within a game, and we are not consultants to give them ideas how to fix their game. Constructive criticism is valuable (and suggesting changes is NOT part of it) but no where near required.<br />

Two years of no diablo news? That sucks, man. I would have loved some more content for D3. They didn't even really end the story. <br />

<br />
Well D3 at this moment is self contained game which can provide enjoyable content for ever and ever. Because of greater rifts, which are random dungeons. They will put new items, tweaks etc regularly im sure, even if game hit maintenance mode. Sure, me as a veteran is kinda burned out but new players can hop right in and they have amazing build to be played for years without adding next chapters etc.</div></div><hr />

Yea but after what they did to Diablo, I seriously doubt people are going to just care about anything they announce. <br />
<br />
They did a horrible job at the start of the game and then fixed it to what it should have been then left the game to rot with just minor changes.<br />
<br />
I get its free to play but when they pulled their devs off Diablo 3 and put them on Wow, it was a sign that Diablo Universe is just dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly this, Diablo 3 is still being patched/PTRed, 2.6.1 is going right now, even if it's a minor patch, it's not dead.<br />
<br />
Even warcraft 3 recently got a new client and a PTR (multiplayer map/item balance), after all this time might mean something bigger is planned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It still is a big overhaul to get new life into the game, they rebalanced a lot of the maps and items.<br />
<br />
Also Warcraft 3 and TFT recently got a new installer, so they might eventually put it on the bnet app, and you can also swap from Reign of Chaos to Frozen Throne in 1 button press in game.<br />

<br />
It's been a not too well hidden secret that WC3 is going to be remastered a la Starcraft (via Blizzard job postings, direct words in interviews) so I don't get why there should be any surprise about things happening on that front.</div></div><hr />
