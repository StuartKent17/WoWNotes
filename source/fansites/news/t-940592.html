Tier 11 Valor Point Hotfix<br />
Due to some recent player feedback we’ve made the decision to implement a hotfix that will put Valor Points back on the bosses in Blackwing Descent, Bastion of Twilight, and Throne of the Four Winds (except Argoloth).<br />
<br />
We agreed that players should have some additional options for earning Valor Points beyond Firelands, Zandalari dungeons, and tier 11 Heroic difficulty raids. We don’t want raiding guilds to feel like they have to raid Firelands AND the old raids every week, but we do want players to feel like they have some options besides running ZA/ZG over and over.<br />
<br />
Bosses in these raids will award 35 VP on 10-player normal difficulty, and 45 VP on 25-player normal difficulty, to match the rewards currently offered for the Heroic versions of those encounters.<br />
<br />
This change should be live within the next few hours. You can stay informed about the latest hotfixes by checking the Patch 4.2 Hotfixes article for updates: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3019413<br />

Rated Battlegrounds Queuing Times<br />
Hey all,<br />
<br />
We are aware of the issue regarding extended queue times affecting Rated Battlegrounds. We’re currently investigating the situation and working to resolve it as soon as possible, but there isn’t an ETA for when this process will be complete. We'll provide further updates as the situation develops and we thank you for your patience in the meantime.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Starter Edition<br />
With the launch of Rage of the Firelands (patch 4.2), we introduced the World of Warcraft Starter Edition, a replacement for the previously available free trial. The Starter Edition allows anyone to play for free up to level 20 without the time restrictions placed on trial accounts -- all you need is a Battle.net account and Internet connection. The Starter Edition also opens up some new features that weren't available in the old time-limited trial:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Players with the WoW Starter Edition can create draenei and blood elf characters, which were previously unavailable with trial accounts.<br />
The two starting zones associated with these races are also available to people wishing to try out the game.<br />
The gold limit has been raised to 10 gold, allowing Starter Edition players to purchase mounts when they reach the appropriate level.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you reach level 20, your characters will stop gaining experience. However, you are free to continue playing and exploring Azeroth for as long as you wish -- or you can roll an entirely new character to try out a new race or class. You can also choose to upgrade to a full, paid account at any time and continue your adventures beyond level 20.<br />
<br />
With the launch of the Starter Edition, all existing trial accounts, including expired ones, have been reactivated. That means if you've tried WoW in the past, your trial-account characters are now accessible once more.<br />
<br />
As you may have already seen, our Recruit-a-Friend program (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3076888) has also been upgraded as a result of the changes introduced with the WoW Starter Edition.<br />
<br />
Now's a better time than ever to try out World of Warcraft. If you’re thinking of getting into WoW or know a friend who's been interested in joining you in Azeroth, it's easy to give it a try today (https://us.battle.net/account/creation/wow/signup/index.xml).<br />
<br />
For more information on this exciting new feature and a full list of restrictions, please visit the Starter Edition FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20590).<br />

There's really no reason to do BWD/BoT for VP unless you're shooting for gear above your skill level that you don't even need o_O<br />

now, just think about how much faster you could do 3 troll heroics with your guildies, instead of clearing all T11 raid content :))<br />

<br />
It isn't SUPPOSED to be faster or better then doing ZA/ZG. It's supposed to be an alternative to ZA/ZG for people who are bored with -having- to run dungeons to reach the VP cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While that is true, I'd rather kill the bosses in the t11 raids for at least some of my valor than keep doing troll heroics for it. The extra time doesnt matter to me. I just want to have fun earning my VP again which I wouldnt be able to do for another 4 weeks (thats when my guild is DUE to start raiding again), so this change is good :p</div></div><hr />

However, now people have an incentive to run these again for both VP and getting good items to finish gearing up for Firelands. My Warrior alt has yet to raid so it will be good to hopefully get into a T11 pug, get some upgrades that I can't get really from JP or Zandalari dungeons, plus still get some VP besides doing a few Zandalari dungeons for my offspec gear (so win win as I'll still be queuing as a tank in LFG, just not for my tank gear)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically this. I would much rather do a raid than chain run ZA/ZG one after the other. I'll still do them to fill in the gaps, but after a while it gets very boring. A raid at least is a more interesting dynamic, better loot in most cases and has a more social aspect than the typical LFD pug. In short there's more of an incentive to run T11 raids than there is to run ZA/ZG.</div></div><hr />

I think its awesome that ill make a little valor on the side instead of more useless JP that i just buy trade goods with. And if a guild can not down 1 or 2 bosses in firelands they can do the old raids to help finish off the weekly cap.</div></div><hr />

My gear can only come from Firelands tokens atm so im not one of the people who NEED valor although it helps. The reason why I agree is because of the Zandalari heroics. Theres only a couple. If they added say, 10 more NEW heroics I wouldn't mind grinding that. It would be a change in scenery. But to see the same damn heroic everytime ugh man it sucks. Ill go back into BoT just so I wont have to do troll-roics that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might be faster, but you still only get 353 gear from there. A BOT/BWD/Throne clear will give you not only 420 vp, but 359 gear, tokens for helms/shoulders and various other boes. Hardly a waste of time and definitely more interesting than za/zg pugs.</div></div><hr />

So who is QQ here? Some just hate doing ZA/ZG all day/week. I for one would like to do something different on a alt instead of run them all day. The reason i say all day is because sometimes you can spend hours just completing 1 ZA due to fail groups. What i don't understand is why are some of the people here complaining when they've said it doesn't affect them, Just shut up and ignore the post.<br />

In short there's more of an incentive to run T11 raids than there is to run ZA/ZG.<br />

IMO it should be rather based around number of downed bosses instead of giving you a big chunk of VP at the end as in &quot;here you go for being patient, putting up with your bad pug for almost an hour&quot;... make it 10VP per boss in old heroics, and 20VP per zandalari boss, with no extra VP awarded for finishing, but instead give you a happy meal/satchel scrap bag once you're done through it (this for zandalari only, and CtA gets double cheese burger/bag).</div></div><hr />

Being bottlenecked into doing either one of only Firelands bosses, Occu'thar (once weekly on these) and the Trollololol instances can be somewhat of a drag - and a pain.<br />
<br />
In essence, I think some people miss the point that while yes, you can cap out with 353 epics and also your VP quota for the week (and granted, probably grab a couple of free shards along the way - unless of course, you're in some imba raiding guild that's flying through Firelands/BOT-BWD-T4W HCs like a hot knife through butter) some of the more social types would like the possibility to get a chance to get something decent, at least. Couple this with the fact that there's always the 359 items you can pick up in those runs too, in the end it can be of a real benefit to the newer breed of raiders that ding 85 for the first time, per sé.<br />
<br />
Now, before anyone comes in and starts flaunting the &quot;f*ck the socials, moar QQ&quot; - I'm taking no side on this one. There are some guilds that wouldn't mind deviating from the path that's fixed and may want to possibly drag an alt or a social run through the normal BOT-BWD-T4W instances. The guild that I'm in currently is more a casual raiding guild that has its' main raiding group going through FL 10 mans, and a banter run simply known as &quot;Wipeclub&quot; - we do aim to give our social guys who may not necessarily be confident on raiding some sort of taste of the pie. And, overall, they really do enjoy it - it's now 12/12.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: To some they may be pissed about it - but I actually do like this hotfix and it's good to see Blizzard taking on feedback. Let's see it more often.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klingers</div><div class="date">2011-07-19, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a fantastic bit of news for my guild, as we're actually just establishing ourselves as a raid team using T11 content as our way of coming together and learning to work as a team. Now we'll get something extra for our time.<br />
<br />
All I know is that I value my limited game time more than the gear I have, so I basically will do without my valor points up till now. There is definitely a feeling of satisfaction when you've put effort into acquiring something, but when it actually starts feeling like work then I lose interest. I already spend eight+ hours a day in front of a PC working. I don't want to do that at home if I can avoid it.<br />
<br />
T11 raids can still be challenging for a casual player like myself. Effort put into a challenge can be fun. Effort put into something boring is basically just work.<br />
<br />
Kudos to Blizzard for this change IMO.</div></div><hr />

People need to realize there are still some players that want gear from T11 content. The possibility to gain a bit of VP in the process is welcome addition. It does not replace need to do FL raid or run several ZA/ZG, however, it gives you a choice. Previously you could run T11 content but its opportunity cost would be time not spent doing FL or capping VP in ZA/ZG/normal HCs. GJ Blizzard!</div></div><hr />

If some people want to get all the VP gear and wait till a nerf to clear a raid, that's their choice (regardless of how that Valor, or any gear really, is obtained).<br />
<br />
If you're gonna cry that they have it easier than you after a few weeks / months because they now have VP gear and you didn't when you decided to start on Firelands, then why did you try in the first place? Just farm VP for a month and come back fully geared as well.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't care what, how, when other people killed or do whatever. What matters is when / how I did it and if I enjoyed it. At the same time, I would also feel VERY SAD If I was one of the few people who get to participate in all the lore present in these raids. Everyone should get to experience it at least once eventually.</div></div><hr />

Not true. &quot;Top tier&quot; is heroic T12. That cannot be obtained any other way than heroic firelands. That's slightly different from running ZA/ZG till your eyes bleed.</div></div><hr />

Really? A full clear get you to cap why you should do anything beside that anyway?<br />
And even if you miss a boss you cna go do a guild ZA/ZG and cap for the week or if you need less just go to BWD and kill Mag/ODS and get some fast VP.<br />
<br />
Whatever have you even raiding at all or you just whine for no reason?</div></div><hr />

What's the point?<br />
<br />
The thing to do is: Remove VP from every old raiding and non-raiding content such as Heroic dungeon and T11.<br />
Casuals don't deserve to get 378 before 4.3 if they don't make the effort to raid.</div></div><hr />

Zandalari heroics and old heroics already award VP, why should old raids (Harder to organise than a heroic, surely) not award them?If you're in normal firelands and raging that casuals can get the same gear as you, maybe you need to step up your game, get Ragnaros down and get into heroic modes.</div></div><hr />

When 4.2 hit, my raid was still working on Cho'gall and Nef. We also only had 8 or 9 people that could be depended on to show up both days a week. We've gained a regular 10th, but he's used to doing mostly PvP, so his gear isn't quite where the rest of ours is. We've killed Shannox, but Rhyolith is a bit much atm. Instead of wiping for 2 hours on Rhyolith (plus anthoer 3 the 2nd day of the week), we've decided to go back and get us some hats and shoulders from those 2 - plus get our new guy geared up appropriately. We were going to do it anyway, but ANYTHING that keeps me from having to do troll dungeons is good. I seem to always get the group that just hit the ilvl to choose trolls, or impatient people who try and rush things, then bail at the first inkling of a wipe.</div></div><hr />

That is totally true. <br />

However, the troll instances are beyond boring, especially ZA, even tho you hit the mount timer it still feels like a little eternity cause it's so monotonous, ZG is kind of passable doing once/twice a day, but ZA is complete boredom.

Players who don't have any time to raid don't have any time to raid and shouldn't be playing a game that's all about raiding. Don't dumb my game down, and everyone else's, in order to please them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to play WoW, but I don't have the time to raid and gear myself properly. Please change the very structure of risk/reward in this game so that I can play it the way I want, regardless of the fact that it will impact everyone else in a negative way !&quot;. For God's sake...<br />
<br />
I wonder, how any of this affects you. You raid, you have fun... what do you care if Johnny over there gets valor point from running dungeons and getting same tier set items as you do. Besides running past him in Orgrimmar, you have no connection what so ever with him. <br />
<br />
Now I agree that badge, valor and all the other crap they came up with is shit, and I'll much rather have classic style raids, where everything dropped from bosses, even tho it took ages for people to get the stuff together, you still could see who raids and who doesn't which is not really possible nowdays, where everyone in Orgrimmar is running tier pieces and look the exactly the same. <br />
<br />
I would much prefer if Valor would be a raid only commodity and dungeons would give Justice, but it is like it is, and they messed up with it long ago. But besides my ego being hurt by a dungeon guy having same gear as me, a raider, there is nothing else that really matters or is a major problem.</div></div><hr />

Im tired of Blizzard always trying to make this game as noobfriendly as they can with rewarding players with the shittiest skillz to get the top tier. BwD and BoT rewards 359 gear, so they changed the 359 tier so you caould get it with justice points. FINE! But when you reward them with valor points for taking down shitbosses (which is 3-manned) i just wanna rip my own head off and shit down my own neck. I start to hate you Blizzard (which i have for the latest 3-4 years)<br />
<br />
If you hate blizzard so much, why dont you quit playing wow then? Or are you just trolling? HC bosses are shitbosses too and they give VP.</div></div><hr />

People can play the whatever f*** they want and the way they want. I don't see the difference in getting 420VP/week from old raids or 420VP/week from old heroics. It's not YOUR game. Go be a special snowflake somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

the 70 valor point way would be nice to get some variety in the way you get your tier<br />
<br />
OR they would place a 140 VP reward for the &quot;normal&quot;heroic dungeons. But that would in some peoples eyes be &quot;too easy&quot;. Well yea the other heroics are easier but ZA/ZG are also easy dungeons. <br />
<br />
I would not complain if they would lower the VP reward from ZA/ZG to 70.</div></div><hr />

We can get VP easier, so no problem with that. But on the other hand it looks a bit wrong too. <br />
<br />
Let’s assume 2 players who have limited playing time. <br />
One does only current raiding content in that time, and the other one does dungeons and the odd PuG raid to T11 for a few hours a week. <br />
<br />
Player1, the current raid player, can get 7 bosses for 140 VP each which is 980 VP<br />
Player2, the non current raid player can get 7 dailies for 70-140 VP each which is 490-980 VP, and downs 2-3 bosses in T11 normal each week and gets 70-105 VP for it. <br />
<br />
This means to cap out, the raider has to clear firelands, which is not something everyone does.<br />
<br />
So the guy who does not do current content, has basically easier access to more VP than the guy that only raids current content, which is harder than the old content. <br />
<br />
With these VP you can buy gear which is meant for this last raiding tier. (inb4: whine about it as much as you like but that is the way it is) <br />
Of all these VP buyable items, a lot of them are BiS and it also holds 3 of the 5 tierset items.So the argument that some people might give (“durr, you get items through boss kills too, so you gear up faster”) is in a lot of the cases not correct. <br />
<br />
So the guy that does not do last tier raids can get gear faster for content he does not run while the guy that needs the gear to tackle current content needs more time. <br />
Not quite logical if you think about it, is it? <br />
<br />
And before people call me elitist: I don’t really mind the change, it just seemed wrong in a way.<br />

It's strange that you tell others to stop justifying their opinions based on their singular experience yet your entire reasoning is simply because -you- have a different experience. That logic is baffling.<br />

Blizzard have been showing more and more these past months that they've become terrible at game design, by making incredibly stupid and arrogant decisions. Whether or not they directly affect me, that doesn't change the fact that they're stupid and arrogant, and that I don't want to either support them, or keep supporting those people by playing the game. Seems to make sense to me.<br />
<br />
But you want specifics, so : if Blizzard tells their players &quot;It's OK to suck and not get better, you'll be rewarded anyway&quot;, like in Wrath, it makes the playerbase retarded, lazy and incompetent, thus affecting my enjoyment of the game. If Blizzard tells their players &quot;You don't have to run current raids to get current-raid-level badges&quot;, it screws up the entire difficulty curve and gear progression of the game, and it makes the playerbase not understand how they're supposed to work, thus affecting my enjoyment of the game. I could go on.<br />
<br />
<br />
We know that Blizzard is changing direction of WoW for a long time now, they call it &quot;changing direction&quot; we, the hardcore players from classic call it a &quot;downward spiral&quot;. There is no point denying that. I to believe that in order to boast the raid gear you should actually raid as opposed to be able to buy it from vendors for points you accumulate by doing easy dungeons. But obviously Blizzard does not agree with us and I don't like it just as much as you don't. <br />
<br />
But getting Valor from old raids is in no way different then getting Valor for piss easy heroic dungeons. In fact, I much prefer giving out valor points for old raids as giving out valor for doing instances which become easier and easier with every passing day. At least that way player would have to raid and would actually invest a bit more as just queuing for a random. <br />
<br />
As for your specifics; this is what guilds are for. You wont accept retards in your guild, will you? If you do random dungeons and hit on a couple of retards, the world wont end, in the worst case scenario, you can either leave or kick them. Players who are &quot;bad&quot; wont be able to do raid content you do, even if they have the same gear, so there's no worry in that.</div></div><hr />

Who the hell cares if t11 content is giving small amounts of valor again? The weekly cap is still 980! The only thing this change does is give you a alternate method of reaching the cap. Anyone who cared enough to try was already capping their points per week anyway, this just removes a tiny bit of the monotony. Come back and complain when &quot;casuals&quot; are literally having better gear than yours mailed to them. Until then, grow up and be happy that you're clearing content while it's relevant with the casuals picking up the crumbs months later after the content's been nerfed into oblivion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobleshield</div><div class="date">2011-07-19, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said before and said before this change, the main benefit is incentive to run T11 for the remaining pieces of gear that most of us still need. The gear in there is just usually better than the shit from the Troll dungeons, but because there was no VP people didn't want to pug it if they didn't need a piece of gear, or could make due with an inferior Troll piece. This change benefits everyone: * The people raiding Firelands have nothing to worry about, they get VP from that, and if you aren't 7/7 in and don't feel like doing a Troll dungeon, go and steamroll T11, maybe get some shiny BoEs that still sell for a bit, and cap VP that way. It also is an incentive for Firelands guilds to go back to T11 for newer members on off nights to get those last pieces of gear they are missing, which helps the guild's overall progression. * The people still gearing up for Firelands could use upgrades from T11 raids, not to mention the chance for tier helm/shoulders, and get VP to help gear up quick. No different than a heroic. * The people who don't raid at all aren't affected at all, as they don't raid. They still run Cata and Troll heroics for their VP and gear, but now they have a better chance of jumping into a T11 pug because more T11 pugs will happen since there's a good benefit to running them other than only gear.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly the case. Woohoo! 35 valor points. Who the hell cares? I suppose you could go clear BWD in an hour and a half and get 210VP... and that's if you don't make any mistakes.<br />

<br />
I dunno, I haven't been capping my VP on my alts at all because I cannot be bothered to do ZA/ZG so much, horrid grind, raiding on the other hand is always fun, so I'll definitely be up for that if I'd have time (which I don't seeing as my main raids 6 times a week, but once that calms down, I'll be more than willing to raid on my alts for the VP cap, even if it's old content - heck, I'd go back to ICC for it, raiding is so much more enjoyable than 5mans). Pugs in Firelands haven't been very successful, so yeah.<br />
<br />
That said, imagine the only way you can get VP is through ZA/ZG on 5 different characters. I think you'd be happy to do somethig else for a change too. I have guildies who do normal heroics, even if its less VP, for the change of scenery.</div></div><hr />

Here we go again... <br />
<br />
Casual player will never:<br />
1. Get 4 piece bonus because they don't raid FL and get to 6/7 at least<br />
2. They will never upgrade their 3 T12 pieces to HC version because - again they don't raid FL.<br />
2a. They will not be even able to upgrade they rep vendor gear because they don't raid FL HC modes<br />
3. Valor point vendor items are not always the best, raids drops are better or at least equal and they don't cost VPs.<br />
4. They won't have legendary staff just because - again! they don't raid.<br />
<br />
What are you all whining about?<br />
No raids - no top gear. Yes, non-raider can get quite ok gear but not good or top gear.<br />
Let's say in scale 1 to 5 they can get about ... 3.5, not higher.<br />
Even casual raider will sport at least 4.0 gear level with 5.0 level being HC lvl gear with BiS in all slots.<br />
<br />
And taking into account that Avengers vendor sells rep gear which again - you can't get that rep unless you raid. <br />
With trash PuGs at least.<br />
But there's a catch - rep intake decreases with each level i noticed.<br />
So again - to get exalted one has to kill bosses.<br />
<br />
When i raided with my guild i noticed that rep intake from trash is going down each rep level.<br />
Currently on honored and smallest trash does not even give rep anymore.</div></div><hr />

What the heck are you talking about? Heroics have been giving raid gear since TBC. It's how Blizzard gets around the issue of raiding guilds having to repeat previous tier content because most of their recruits are undergeared. Gear has nothing to do with skill, it's a tool for progression to give encounters you have beaten a replay value.<br />
<br />
Raids still drop the best gear and the only thing old raids granting VP does is reduce the amount of stupid troll instances players have to run to cap their VP. It's nothing but alternatives to a time sink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a great perspective, and I am in the same boat.<br />
<br />
We went 1/7, 3/7, 4/7 the first 3 weeks. That means I still need to get 500 VP aside from the 9 hours I spend raiding. <br />
<br />
It's really annoying because it's an absolute necessity to cap out. I know some of my guildies just don't have the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is so sad it almost makes me want to cry. You should ask those people if they know what 2+2 is, b/c I swear a 6 year old should be able to clear T11 normal modes now. <br />
<br />
On topic: I don't see a problem with it. So what if they are able to get 1 piece of gear every 3-4 weeks, in the end they still only have less than 1/3 of their gear as 378 after running old content for months. They can't get their 4 set, they cant get heroic gear, they cant get the legendary, they cant get titles or mounts. There's still so much distinguishing them from the &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders. Although to be fair this doesn't affect me at all as my guild clears T12 every week, but it does help my alts gear up faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I like the change because right now, my guild raid group is trying to swap in and out some members, to find out the best possible group. So right now, we are back in BoT/BWD/TotFW 1 night a week, we clear everything to get the last people get their last pieces and have an idea at other's overall performance. Now that it gives something to the ones like me that don't feel like t11 is of any use, but still has to go do them for the good of the group. I find it a good change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are people who only manage a view bosses yet. While I am myselves at 6/7, the second group in our guild is much worse (actually 1/7, with another 2 probably soon falling, but not much more than 3/7 probably happening ANYTIME soon). If they have no decent possibility to fill up their VP they fall further behind. And actually I cannot raid every week (too many people of my class, need to alternate), so I also need to have some VP-options which are not driving one crazy for the week where it is not my turn. This new change is very good!</div></div><hr />

They are annoying, VARY GRINDY, and overall id rather get no VP then do a troll heroic. and the guild im in just formed and so far we are working on t11 and heroic t11 befor we go to firelands. I think its awesome that ill make a little valor on the side instead of more useless JP that i just buy trade goods with. And if a guild can not down 1 or 2 bosses in firelands they can do the old raids to help finish off the weekly cap.<br />
<br />
12 bosses = 360VP (10), 540 (25). Granted that ZA/ZG is annoying, however doing ZA/ZG is much more efficient because it does not have to be scheduled. You have to run a total of 7 times per week at any given time. <br />
<br />
So maybe the issue here is that some people are just trying to grind it out in one day and are getting burned out by it. But there are still better choices because you can do the other heroics (DM &amp; SFK is the worst) since you can fly through the so easily.<br />

The poster I was referring to clearly bases his self worth on his VP bought gear, and believes that other people obtaining gear with VP is a detriment to the health and safety of the world (of Warcraft)<br />
<br />
More clearly: I'm making fun of some poor kid who got his feelings hurt over the VP change. The VP change is good for people who need it, harmless for people who don't, and terrible for people who tie their self confidence to the fact that they have gear that someone else doesn't.<br />

sorry casual raiders,i dont just get why you have life so easy ( even if you guys think its still hard ). we ''worked'' very hard to loot those bosses that you guys are still failing at 1/2 even if they got nerfed by 20% i think... i dont get the logic seriously. but hey blizz loves casual since 80%+ players are casual. business is business....:mad:<br />
<br />
Like this guy. Tell me why it bothers you that someone else gets gear? You have your goals, you have your achievements. People that can't meet those goals won't get those Achievements. You will be able to show off your title to prove your accomplishments. &quot;Casuals&quot; that haven't done what you've done can obtain about half the gear you can by clearing everything. Now tell us all why that's a problem?</div></div><hr />

Except in 10 man, then you just need to run a simple regular heroic. The content is now T12, not T11. If you're having to run multiple heroics on your main every week because you can't get normal mode T12 bosses down in 2-3 nights, find a better guild imo or find a guild and stop pugging it. Learn how to play the game for once and stop asking for freebies or you'll never get better. My guild has two runs clearing Firelands, and we have a run for alts and even those guys are doing normal 7/7. It is a completely unnecessary change. I haven't run those troll instances since the first week they were out, and ZA was only to get the bear. It's mind blowing that people welcome this change - Blizzard isn't just listening to the people that can't play their game, they're encouraging them not to actually learn how either. Consolation prizes for the whiners.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your math fails, in order to cap from just doing heroics, you either have to do 7 troll heroics, or 7 normal heroics, and 4 troll heroics, or some other combination, and honestly, the t11 raids are easier than the troll heroics now<br />

This is exactly the case. Woohoo! 35 valor points. Who the hell cares? I suppose you could go clear BWD in an hour and a half and get 210VP... and that's if you don't make any mistakes.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, this change doesn't really entice current Firelands raiders to cap using anything except ZA/ZG and normal heroics.<br />
<br />
you can easily clear BWD in less than an hour now<br />

im really starting to think that people don't realize that blizzard doesnt have the resources to keep the game alive and cater to the smaller part of the population, they're running a business, they have to do what they can to keep the majority of the population (i.e. &quot;casuals&quot;) paying to continue making profit, the people saying stop catering to casuals clearly have no business sense whatsoever</div></div><hr />

When Firelands dropped, the PUG's for the T11 raids basically vanished overnight. <br />
<br />
Now the FL trash runs have mostly stopped (people getting their rep / BOE's / whatever), and the average raid guild is maybe killing Shannox and wiping on Beth'ilac currently. There wasn't any point to running the old T11 content in this model: why spend time for suboptimal results that are putting you even further behind the progression curve? <br />
<br />
Sure there were some that'd do it to break up the monotony, but this change may actually cause people to revisit the T11 raids on various alts, compared to now which was all spent grinding ZA/ZG or BG's for the Honor gear. Smart change on Blizzard's part, and I welcome it.</div></div><hr />

Why cant they just stay a tier of gear behind the better players? There already is a system(s) BUILT IN that differentiates the top players from everyone else. Here is a thought experiment.... Imagine that Blizzard dedicated an entire server to the top 50 guilds on the planet. All of them existed on this single server. The same exact order would naturally occur. The #1 top guild would complain that guild #50 isn't learning how to play the game properly and needs to stop complaining and to get better and stop using valor points to get freebie gear.</div></div><hr />

If you'd rather run ZA/ZG, the option's clearly there. If you still have gaps to fill in your pre-Firelands gear, or have a good group of people you enjoy playing with, there's the option of running T11's.<br />

What difference does it make if 'casuals' reach their cap from T11's or from heroic 5-mans?<br />
<br />
That logic doesn't even make sense... Who would you accept into your Guild? The guy who is 353 ilvl having never done a raid in WoW or the 359 ilvl guy who came late to the party and, albeit nerfed content, has actually been outside of a 5-man?<br />
<br />
The choice is pretty obvious to me. Not sure how it seems to elude the masses here. They didn't raise the VP cap. They created another option of getting to it. For someone cracking insults at casuals, your logic of raid gear via 5-mans is more &quot;casual friendly&quot; than this change.<br />

Just so we're on the same page... You're suggesting that the troll heroics are in any way more difficult than t11's, even post nerf?<br />
<br />
If that's the case... Well, yeah. Maybe you zoned into a different troll heroic than I did, because they're pretty faceroll to me.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't really taking them into account with my post, but in a perfect world, I do think they should give Justice, and if 5 mans that give valor are essential to help more people enjoy the game, two additional, harder 5 mans should be introduced--or even upgraded, like SFK or DM. Although after running a pug in which Cho'gall's first add was killed in the dead center of the room and one tank had 3 stacks of fury for the majority of the fight, I do think a case could be made for Troll 5 mans being harder than T11 raids at present. I mean, you do still need people to stand on chains at least some of the time on JinDoh.</div></div><hr />

If you just run BWD, you will get 210 VP and the chance to get some decent upgrades for your character if they are not running Firelands raids. This change is great for alts and makes running the T11 raids a viable source of VP in place of running a nights worth of Zandalari heroics, and who isn't tired of running the same 2 instances over and over again every day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
First and for all you can get ilvl 359 gear also without even doing a raid (the 3-4 slots left are quite easily filled with boE items if you ask me)<br />
Secondly a number of items is/can be replaced by ilvl 365 and 378 BoE.<br />
The only thing on which you can rely is looking at their achievements, gemming choices and reforging strategy. Gear is not reliable anymore to judge by.<br />
<br />
Secondly you know what logic also doesn't make sense? That it is easier to get Valor points outside of the current raid tier than to do that current raid tier, for which the Valor points are meant in the first place.<br />
Don't you think that is weird? And agreed it was like that before this change already.<br />
<br />
The system that was in before which was that only doing heroic dungeons could not get you capped, made a lot more sense to me actually.<br />
<br />
And before people flame me for elitism again (or whatever the word is for it) : I will take advantage of it too since we provide T11 runs for our social members and alts. Hell, the people that are struggling with T11 still, will probably need the gear more than I do. So it is not so that I am unhappy with this, or that I don’t want others to get gear too. The system just feels kind of incorrect.<br />

ilvl 353 is not that much worse than ilvl 359 gear... but at least they give you 140 VP which leads to ilvl 378 gear.<br />
and those 353 gear items will be replaced fast by ilvl 365 as soon as the molten front vendors unlock.</div></div><hr />

I love these sort of posts. It's like out of the blue, &quot;THEM DAMN CASUALS!&quot; I mean really, what goes through your mind when you post something like that? Oh no, bosses like Chimaeron and Cho'gall are handing out VP again to you damn freeloaders! It's not like any of those fights still remain harder than anything you'll find in the Zandalari instances.<br />
<br />
Blizzard removed VP from tier 11 instances because they nerfed them and made them easier, but that didn't make sense because the heroic 5-man instances still grant VP and they're even easier. If VP should be difficult content only they need to remove them from the heroic rewards as well, but then players would have nothing to grind outside raids.</div></div><hr />
