Translation: We're not going back on the GCD thing, deal with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm you could take a portal to all of the zones and your guild could use a summon, so players could log in, teleport to the raid, and log off. Taking guild summon away was met with negative feedback, but the ease of transportation was bad for the game.<br />
God forbid that players ought to be able to do that if they so chose. Nope, we've got to artificially increase time spent in the game.</div></div><hr />

Why? Do everyone have to be in favour of what you're doing in BfA? Most if not all feedback regarding the GCD changes has been negative yet you say it's better for the game long-term. If it's heavily disliked now, it won't be liked in the future, especially by people that played with the changes and gave feedback for it.</div></div><hr />

Doubling down? They literally just said that some abilities are taking off from GCD (like Disengage or Heroic Leap).</div></div><hr />

Screw them for this bullshit. That's a goddamned straight up lie.<br />
<br />
The team is trying to get classes to a good base state where each expansion can add interesting abilities that will be left behind each expansion.<br />
<br />
*headdesk* There goes any type of permanent future character progression.<br />
<br />
The team wants to avoid these traits feeling like another set of talents, allowing you to swap them between fights in a raid.<br />
You can reset all of the choices on a piece of armor for a small gold cost (5-10 gold) that ramps up rapidly the most often you do it. The cost will decay quickly.<br />

Yay...</div></div><hr />

This is actually exactly what they are doing. If you arent able to think about the health of the game over your own interests then you should leave for sure. His example of have group will travel was a very appropriate one. Glad it was said. <br />
<br />
This is the future of the game. They are making changes for the game, not for the players. You had that for 10 years, and look at the mess the game was in before legion.</div></div><hr />

Well sadly you cant retcon reality if you attract a audience and put game systems in you cant remove them with the same ease without blowing it up in to your face. They are going for dmg control and slowly reverting stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that launching High Elves right after Void Elves isn't very good for the franchise. But he needs to do some more research about the lore of his own game, because he clearly didn't speak as if he dominates the lore of the game.<br />
<br />
And, as he already said, never say never. Everything is open in the future. So, this is the story for BfA: Void Elves vs. Blood Elves. Makes sense.</div></div><hr />

He also mentioned population whiiich void elves destroy that argument.. <br />

Honestly...his head may wind up on the chopping block for this kinda shit(he seems to be ignoring player feedback in almost every area more the blizz usually does). <br />
<br />
I do suspect bfa may tank worse then WoD at this rate. And not the high ekf thing but class redesign(or lack of it), no new skills, the heart if azeroth being artifact weapon 2.0(amd admitting they plan to give us new skills abd then toss them out each xpac WHO THE F THINKS THAT IS SMART) just soooo much bad game design abd ignoring kf the playerbase(gcd, high elves.

No, Blizzard decides if you get loot or not. Taking away choice again and putting it on the RNG-wheel again.<br />
What is the reason to be in a Guild then ? To do group content ? The reason people are in those groups is to be together and the social aspect of doing things together and deciding what they do with the rewards because they killed it.</div></div><hr />

Yet Void Elves are a tiny minority of a fucking group of exiled Elves. Silver Covenant is an army full of just High Elves.<br />
<br />
Bullshiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit Excuse. Why do they need to be consistently arrogant assholes when it comes to this.<br />
<br />
Literal favourite Unit in the RTS were the High Elf Rangers on Alliance yet will never actually get them. Yet we have Void Elves... wooooooooooooooooooo<br />
<br />
Full agree'd, especially with the small group of exiles somehow equating to enough to be a &quot;race&quot;. <br />
<br />
Side note : <br />
Why would we ever make a change that people don't like or doesn't feel good? The team knows the initial reaction would be negative. At the end of the day, they want everyone to enjoy the game and it to feel good. They should just come out and say &quot;we don't give two shits about what you like or what you find feels good&quot; instead of always trying to pussyfoot around the issue. <br />
<br />
Ever since they changed their stance to (iirc) &quot;We make a game we want to play and we invite you to play it&quot;? I just get the &quot;fuck you, we like it, you schmucks can deal&quot; vibe.</div></div><hr />

Agree with that. There should be no RNG factor in gear distribution when you are in a guild group. This feels extremely unfair when some new guild recruit continuously fail on boss mechanics but in the end he/she gets an item because they were simply lucky. And what if that person simply leave the guild after that? That item is wasted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before (with loot master), there were two systems in play: RNG and whether or not someone else determined you should have the loot or not. With personal loot, it is just RNG that determines it.<br />
<br />
Having been on the receiving end of capricious rules that change from week to week, I'm rather glad that the capriciousness is gone. I've gotten far more loot (and traded what I didn't need to others) with personal loot than I ever got with master loot in the many years it was around.<br />
<br />
Personal loot has a higher gear drop rate (by about 50%) than without. Why bother asking the plethora of questions on why someone does or doesn't, in your view, deserve loot when it shouldn't be your decision? It seems silly to me to determine someone else's fate. They're paying for the game as much as you are, they don't yield control to you and they shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Seems silly to me that you play an mmorpg and the last sentence is so entitled that i could literary be a meme, so kudos<br />
<br />
If you want a chery on top also say &quot;you dont pay my sub you dont tell me that i cant wear cloth as a hunter&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
When deciding on Allied Races, why did you choose Void Elves instead of High Elves?<br />
Void Elves are basically High Elves. They have a slightly different backstory but if you want a tall, blonde hair elf, that's a Blood Elf. We just met Alleria and got the backstory of the Void Elf and they wanted to add a race that looked a little like the Blood Elf and Void Elves fit -- eye color isn't the same, maybe contact lens in the future.<br />
<br />
So is it void elves are like high elves or blood elves are like high elves.</div></div><hr />

Blood Elves are basically High Elves. Slightly different eye color and backstory, but if you want to be a light skinned elf, that is basically a Blood Elf. Giving that to the Alliance would blur the line between factions.<br />
There aren't a ton of High Elves out there in WoW.<br />
If you are Alliance any want to be an elf, the Horde is there for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Horde<br />
<br />
The Horde being evil is a matter of perspective.<br />
The Horde has many facets to it, with the Forsaken representing different things than the Tauren. There has been an uneasy partnership between these groups for some time. The Horde isn't monolithic.<br />
There are groups are fighting for survival and some resort to desperate measures.<br />
Both sides should be worried about becoming evil.<br />
All the way back to Orcs vs Humans, you may have assumed Humans were the good guys and Orcs were evil, but t here was more nuance than that. <br />

It's quite strange to see Alleria with a normal complexion while the players have to sport something else completely. Also, Alliance has several choices for playing blue-skinned races.

Treat your customers properly and with respect (and listen to their feedback). That's how long-standing companies are still going strong to this day and have a returning customer base who come for the quality they enjoy and are willing to pay for.<br />
<br />
Treating customers with respect does not equal &quot;do everything every single one of them asks for&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Playing ret having a gcd on wings is going to not take very long to adapt to.<br />
And holy shit, every expansion classes feel slower on beta because you're going to it from full raid gear on live. And no, they didn't kill permanent player progression, they have always been doing this.<br />
<br />
With that said I agree that getting rid of master loot is dumb. People should be rewarded for sticking around for progression and not just being there for the kill. You can't translate raid loot philosophy from 5mans.</div></div><hr />

Until you pay for the equipment and account of another person, you are not entitled to tell them how they can or cannot play. It's not about their, or my, supposed entitlement. It is clearly about your sense you have it, especially with your response. Think first before you type. <br />
<br />
I'm glad for their clear answer on this festering problem. If something can be abused, it will be (and has). This loot resolves that to some degree. I'm sure more iterations will occur to remove more abusive behavior - and that's a good thing.<br />

I might be totally wrong and sorry if I am.<br />
but the way certain classes have played in recent years its almost like the dev team <br />
just dont understand how they actually work.<br />
<br />
one thing they promised after 18 months of WOD, they would listen to the alpha/beta feedback<br />
fine if they want to keep the changes but i just dont understand why bother asking for feedback if they dont like<br />
the replies. At the moment thats 100% how it comes across.<br />

<br />
The Horde has many facets to it, with the Forsaken representing different things than the Tauren. There has been an uneasy partnership between these groups for some time. The Horde isn't monolithic.And yet they keep delegating power to a sole person who, for the last two rounds, has only had one faction of the Horde’s best interests in mind. And nobody except Grandpa stood up this time.<br />
<br />
There are groups are fighting for survival and some resort to desperate measures.Except the storylines have never shown the Alliance to be actively trying to eradicate the Horde races; Kul Tiras was the closest and they weren’t part of the Alliance any more at that time.<br />
Both sides should be worried about becoming evil.“I’m not evil, YOU’RE evil, this whole courtroom is evil!”<br />
<br />
All the way back to Orcs vs Humans, you may have assumed Humans were the good guys and Orcs were evil, but t here was more nuance than that.Um, did he even play that game? All the mission briefings were: humans - “We’re defending our homes and families!” and orcs: “Here’s how we’re going to take these humans’ homes and kill their families.” It wasn’t until the Warcraft paperback novels and more so Chronicle Volume 2 that they made it so the Horde were really just doing it to escape the dying of Draenor.</div></div><hr />

He said the Horde being evil is a matter of perspective, not that evil in general is subjective, the nuance is: The Forsaken probably act evil, the Tauren do not, the Horde is not just the Forsaken and also some inviidual Forsaken may disagree as much with Sylvanas as many Orcs disagreed with Garrosh (but well on the other side, the Forsaken are probably more loyal to their leader).</div></div><hr />

Most of my friends left the game due to getting tired of relearning their class every expansion (I unsubbed due to the SV change to melee) what's wrong with staying the same or slowly growing (the character *hero throughout the expansions but the challenges, stories etc all change to keep it interesting)<br />

<br />
When deciding on Allied Races, why did you choose Void Elves instead of High Elves?<br />
Void Elves are basically High Elves. They have a slightly different backstory but if you want a tall, blonde hair elf, that's a Blood Elf. We just met Alleria and got the backstory of the Void Elf and they wanted to add a race that looked a little like the Blood Elf and Void Elves fit -- eye color isn't the same, maybe contact lens in the future. <br />
<br />
So is it void elves are like high elves or blood elves are like high elves.<br />
<br />
Well in Blizzard's opinion, it's probably both. :|</div></div><hr />

Feedback about what feels bad about your spec after the GCD changes is helpful. Asking to revert the change because it is bad isn't helpful.<br />

When you kill a boss, it isn't about if there is something on the corpse that you want, but if someone is going to give you that loot. It disconnects the reward from killing the boss.<br />
You deserve the loot for killing the boss.<br />

I don't understand how people continue to interpret &quot;vocal minority&quot; as majority.<br />
<br />
I get beefs with the game and its design, even if I don't agree with said beefs. But the hyperbolic claims of majority are so TBC.<br />
I am under no illusion that the majority of player's are tuned into the Q&amp;A or are even aware of it, in fact I know that we represent around 5% of the player base. The thing is what they say in the Q&amp;A is actually meaningless but the attitudes and beliefs of the dev team do matter as that shows up in their work. And the WoW team has a deep seated animosity towards their player base and it shows up whenever they decide to make a change, the player feedback is irrelevant they're going to go through with it regardless. How much longer until they do something extremely stupid and ignore feedback until it's live?<br />
<br />
There is also the issue of expansion abilities, something that they somehow can't put two and two together. They've outright said the leading cause of players leaving the game is class changes so of course Blizzard in their infinite wisdom has came up with a system that causes classes to have integral parts of their rotation on a expansion by expansion basis.</div></div><hr />

Change is often desired but not often accepted. Everyone has their own view about what is or isn't good. With various factions of player groups having competing views on what is good or bad for the game, there will never be consensus. Ever.<br />
<br />
That is particularly a strange position for which a development team must design. How do you please all of the people all of the time? From the last couple or few decades of gaming, I've never once seen 100% agreement on any feature or change in a game. Maybe there shouldn't be either. Having differing views opens opportunity for improvement. If we all agreed all of the time, the game would never truly be innovative.<br />
<br />
Thats a flippant way of ignoring problems though. For Legion and BfA there has been near universal disdain for certain design decisions. Such as the legendaries or the pruning. Likewise many specs there is an overwhelming agreement that shit is wrong. <br />

Yes at times its hard to tell what is what. <br />

Treat your customers properly and with respect (and listen to their feedback). That's how long-standing companies are still going strong to this day and have a returning customer base who come for the quality they enjoy and are willing to pay for.<br />
<br />
But which section of the playerbase do you listen to? They're listening to the majority of their playerbase. At no point should they make decisions that impact the entire game around the sub-5% of us that raid Mythic. Most of our feedback involves fucking up the game for everyone else. That's not healthy. They ARE listening to what everyone else wants, we already have the best shit. <br />
<br />
Like the loot change, I don't even like Ion but he's right. We exploit the shit out of recruits. You can see posts in this very forum from people who SHARD GEAR before giving it to recruits. That's fucked up, I've always thought that's fucked up. Being a recruit in most Mythic guilds is an awful experience, you put in the work and you get nothing for it. Loot distribution causes drama. Again, on this very forum look at all the stories of guilds disbanding over loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's fine, but where are the good aspects? The story, thus far, is yielding a ton of backlash. The classes are stripped down further and having leggos/traits re-packaged as &quot;azerite armor&quot; as if it's something new and re-gifted them. PS, most don't feel great at &quot;baseline,&quot; so that was another goal missed. The systems are truncated. There's less armor art being generated. GCD changes. Personal loot. More AP grind. Islands and Warfronts on alpha (and now beta) were generally underwhelming and will absolutely become repetitive.<br />
<br />
So again, I ask--if we are to accept the &quot;unpopular&quot; aspects for the so-called &quot;good of the game,&quot; where are the popular aspects? The things people asked for over a decade ago?<br />

Everything stated about personal loot was ridiculous, btw.<br />

&quot;There is more personal agency and control as an individual of your fate.&quot;<br />

Blood Elves are basically High Elves. Slightly different eye color and backstory, but if you want to be a light skinned elf, that is basically a Blood Elf. Giving that to the Alliance would blur the line between factions.<br />
There aren't a ton of High Elves out there in WoW.<br />
If you are Alliance any want to be an elf, the Horde is there for you.<br />
<br />
Enough video's why they are not. <br />
<br />
But lets break it down shale we:<br />
Slightly different eye color and backstory &lt;&gt; Nightfallen vs night elves. 2 tauren spieces...<br />
Alliance would blur the line between factions &lt;&gt; Yeah and panda's worked out crappy...oohh wait they did not. <br />
There aren't a ton of High Elves out there in WoW &lt;&gt; same could be said for void elves. Hell likely there are more high elves as void void elves.<br />
If you are Alliance any want to be an elf, the Horde is there for you &lt;&gt; so better said: screw you. you are not getting anything cool. Horde is getting all the cool races, and all their wishes.</div></div><hr />

Why should i, you seem to set in to your mind it isnt. Its a opinion, fine, go play a moba then, no world with to worry walking arround and solo queue all day.<br />
<br />
However stop making asinine statments why an rpg is an rpg<br />
<br />
<br />
to be fair, the game can hardly be considered an mmo at all anymore. with the queues. instancing. isntant travel. moba/arcade gameplay, scaling, auto loot distribution, and the list goes on...<br />
<br />
yeah im see the affects right now</div></div><hr />

And GCD change is a good things, more on pvp and on pve, but i guess you need to go play Beta to actually see it and now just QQ about it on forums, and yeah the QQ comming for the minority, bc the moyority of the player base dont care, they adapt and keep playing or move along. <br />

Because you were the one that criticized my opinion in the first place. At least come up with a counter opinion instead of just a hostile &quot;then leave&quot; comment. So original.<br />
<br />
When you're raiding with your guild, you have a set time that you need to be there and meet up. The only difference between logging in and porting there, and logging in and walking there is the travel time. Time that, ironically, is very important to Blizzard's metrics, but that bring exactly zero enjoyment to players.<br />
You're not stopping to smell the roses or &quot;enjoy the RPG&quot; while you're traveling there, you're just wasting time walking the same path you walk every raid night. <br />
<br />
There are good examples of forcing people to take more time in an rpg, like no flying while leveling your first character. This example they used isn't one of those.<br />
It's a bizarre justification for making things take more time &quot;just because.&quot;<br />
Unless what you consider the enjoyable rpg elements of a game are the equivalent of the ride to work every day.<br />
<br />
And you know what? We'd been doing this since before the perk, too, by sending two saps to the stone beforehand. The perk just encouraged more group play by making it more likely for people to group up, and wait for others to show up, for an activity.<br />
<br />
I don't play WoW because I want it to be a MOBA, but I don't want it to be a tedious travel simulator, either. And I find this particular part of the Q&amp;A to exemplify the misguided direction the directors are taking the game in right now.</div></div><hr />

that your logic???, man.....<br />
<br />
you undestand that first we speaking about a MMO, WoW still one of the biggest out there, on a age where mmo are dying, and a 14 year old game.<br />
<br />
And even if that wasnt a big things for you. They will not spend the amount of money they put on each expansion and support to a dying game.....<br />

They're listening to the majority of their playerbase. At no point should they make decisions that impact the entire game around the sub-5% of us that raid Mythic. Most of our feedback involves fucking up the game for everyone else. That's not healthy. They ARE listening to what everyone else wants, we already have the best shit. <br />
<br />
Like the loot change, I don't even like Ion but he's right. We exploit the shit out of recruits. You can see posts in this very forum from people who SHARD GEAR before giving it to recruits. That's fucked up, I've always thought that's fucked up. Being a recruit in most Mythic guilds is an awful experience, you put in the work and you get nothing for it. Loot distribution causes drama. Again, on this very forum look at all the stories of guilds disbanding over loot.<br />
<br />
I don't even Raid anymore since Emerald Nightmare so &quot;us&quot; Mythic Raiders doesn't apply to me.<br />
I'd like to see that 5% thing people throw around though (since a lot of people refer to it).<br />

<br />
I can remember a prot warrior in classic being awarded Thunderfury. Not because of DKP, attendance, or that he was fundamentally a better player. It was arbitrary. He said it would help with his threat. Could it? Sure, but it wasn't really intended for him - it was a dps weapon as his class already had 2 legendaries available (one for use as a tank). (And, for edification, I wasn't playing a class that could use the weapon, so I didn't want it. I still thought it was dumb to deny to the DPS classes like rogues who could solve their own aggro problems.)<br />
<br />
you know that TF was a tank weapon right? up until like naxx where they made it &quot;one handed&quot; instead of &quot;main hand&quot; so you could use it in your offhand<br />
<br />
I mean people kept using it in TBC on tanks cos it was that good.<br />
if your guidl gave it to a DPS DURING MC/BWL then they were dumbasses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Worgand</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, basically what I'm reading here is that &quot;We hear your feedback, but you're wrong so stuff it&quot;. When they announced BFA and I read about the expansion the first thing I said in our guild discord when we were going over it together was &quot;This is sounding an awful lot like WoD 2.0&quot;. I know they start working on expansions as the current expansion is rolling out, but the game was in Alpha for what, 2-3 months max? The expansion comes out in 110 days, and we're already in the Beta, traditionally very few major changes occur in the Beta and as it stands a lot of classes are looking TRASH.<br />
<br />
Who honestly cares that they're moving key artifact traits/abilities to our talents? All that does is remove talents we're already using just to regain something we had and has been ripped from us. Rogue without urge to kill/SoT/KB/BotA (especially now that bleeds are included in our mastery) is going to play like hot garbage, but hey at least they listened and gave us Dispatch back AS A TALENT, thank god we got that iron wire talent, I know I was saying &quot;Damn, I really wish my garrotes silence lasted a really long time&quot;. Classes transitioning from legion to BFA are going to be even worse off as we've gained nothing new, we've actually lost talents so they could make room for things we had baseline with artifacts in Legion. When we went from WoD to Legion we lost the empowered traits, but we still at least had a new talent row. With Legion what do we get? No new spells, no new talent row, we're losing talents and a majority of the traits in our artifacts, for some classes almost all of them. But hey, we're getting azurite armor right? Too bad from what I've seen thus far it's incredibly basic with nothing interesting added.<br />
<br />

The thing is what they say in the Q&amp;A is actually meaningless but the attitudes and beliefs of the dev team do matter as that shows up in their work. And the WoW team has a deep seated animosity towards their player base and it shows up whenever they decide to make a change, the player feedback is irrelevant they're going to go through with it regardless. How much longer until they do something extremely stupid and ignore feedback until it's live?<br />
<br />
There is also the issue of expansion abilities, something that they somehow can't put two and two together. They've outright said the leading cause of players leaving the game is class changes so of course Blizzard in their infinite wisdom has came up with a system that causes classes to have integral parts of their rotation on a expansion by expansion basis.<br />

<br />
I actually feel the total opposite about it.<br />
I can see not feeling good about a new or trial member getting a bis piece of gear, especially a more essential one like a trinket or something, and not being able to give it to a member that's been around and been reliable or for whom it might be a better fit.<br />
Items like mounts that don't impact group performance are likely better off on personal loot instead of being able to be used as bribes or favoritism, and everyone having a shot to get them means more people will be likely to show up as the raid gets old.</div></div><hr />

They're removing it from a small number of people (master looters) and giving it to everyone. That means people in the raid are empowered to make the choice on their own as to whether or not it is in their interests or the guild's to give a piece of loot to someone.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting you think it is the opposite. Let me use your hyperbole logic for a second. (It's a bad example, but relevant in context.) You're saying the developers should give a limited number of players guns and hope that they only use those guns for good. That obviously hasn't worked out in most cases as master looting has invariably led to &quot;gun shots&quot; via friendly fire. Instead, Blizzard is arming all players. <br />
<br />
Is it a perfect solution? Absolutely not. Is it better than what was there before? Absolutely. Nothing is perfect. But, they are in fact, giving agency to players - not removing it.<br />
<br />
except you cant give the item to them unless you got a higher ilvl one?<br />
<br />
so no, you have literally zero agency over what items anyone gets in the guild.<br />
<br />
how can making loot objectively less reliable and less rewarding be a good thing?<br />
this is literally just punishes guilds that knew how to use ML for the apparent crimes of these rampant guilds that ninja all the loot that I've never seen even though I've been playing this game for 14 years.<br />
<br />
also did you just bring up a gun analogy in which your solution is giving everyone guns? REALLY? you really went there?<br />
<br />
and it doesnt even work like that<br />
<br />
it's more like the government randomly selects people to give guns to. regardless of their mental health, history of violence or any other criminal activity.<br />
<br />
<br />
scenario a:<br />
a leather belt with haste and crit drops from the boss<br />
<br />
a DH wants it and gets it cos it's good stats for him and not for the two rogues in the raid<br />
<br />
scenario b: the leather belt drops for the rogue, he cant trade it, but he'Ll just vendor it cos it's garbage for him<br />
<br />
yeah, I'll let you decide the better option.<br />
<br />
literally half the loot will got to waste or to suboptimal people. from this change, especially rings.<br />
<br />
LITERALLY HALF. I'M calling it now.<br />
<br />
seriously if you want an example, just look at the weekly chest rewards you get from mythic+<br />
how many times is it actually an upgrade? like once every 2 months? that means 7 out of 8 loot you get will not be good for you, and someone else would be happier with it.</div></div><hr />

To clarify I don't believe they have animosity to specific people or to people who are producing positive fan content, but there is a clear communication break down with the WoW team and the community at this time. Hell last month we had the minor &quot;cynically negative&quot; controversy, and it's hardly the first one of this type, much of the Blizzard team does have a clear and demonstrable disdain towards the critical component of the player base. I'll absolutely admit that Blizzard isn't entirely in the wrong here, the WoW community is notoriously ornery, but it's a clear difference between this and the Overwatch team which deals with a similarly ornery player base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Endure but not thrive. Been on downward slope since Mists. You can't deny that. There is a reason they don't report sub numbers.<br />
<br />
The removal of GCD (Thus discouraging macros) and dumbing down looting is making it obvious that they can't sustain the game in this state so they are going to throw it on consoles. There is a reason for all this dumbing down, cant except a console player to macro properly.<br />
<br />
Somewhere along the way they lost the plot. Maybe it was after Kaplan left, maybe it was when they started hiring people that just felt that they own the game and don't have to listen to fans. But its undeniable that the quality has tanked since Ion came on. He has a contempt with designing the game to hamper player I haven't seen with any other game dev, Blizzard or otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Yes the Alliance have questionable actions in their past.

what are you talking about?<br />
perfomance doesnt matter, since no matter how well you perform you have the same chance as anyone for loot.<br />
this is basically discourages you from giving 110% because no matter how good you are, you're only as valuable as the worst performing member, who may have literally just joined the guild, and will leave right after he gets a random loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A huge part of designing a game, especially (if not the most affected genre) MMORPGs, is that you cannot simply let designs that can on the short-term be seen as a benefit to playerpower is the way to design the game. Or be even dumber and design it like a democracy, letting the loudest, most shortsighted options that manage to garner more support than the alternative become the chosen path. Abilities off the GCD is beneficial to players, that does not necessarily mean it's the best design. You being able to instantly heal yourself for half your health when moving is beneficial, but it does not necessarily mean it's the best way to design your class' survivability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like many other areas of the game, GCDs had snowballed, and not a moment too soon is it time to roll back to sane levels. WoW isn't an Action RPG 3rd person version of Diablo 3. At least I miss the anticipation of popping CDs, trinkets and potions and getting ready to unload sick damage on the boss. The slight delay was part of why it made my character feel powerful in those moments. Getting hit by an oh-shit level of damage as you can not 0.05 seconds later pop a 50% heal is part of why falling to low health used to feel like you were risking death, not because you happened to blink in that exact moment and lagged 0.1 second on your reaction time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has made many mistakes, like letting leveling get completely broken, letting non-premade content become insultingly easy in bare minimum gear (still a huge issue), but letting combat lose all it's impact is a big one. Sometimes it feels like I have to look for a screen-shake addon to remind myself my character is actually obliterating everything in his path. Ya'll shouting about Blizzard ignoring feedback, or how awful this change is, have surely spent more time bitching about this change parroting what other people has said about it, than it'll take before you're used to it once BFA is released.</div></div><hr />

SWEET! I have fond memories of Wintergrasp during WotLK, would be great to play it again with lots of players. Wintergrasp atm is dead and almost impossible to do its achievements.<br />
<br />
This is super cool, except didn't they already do this or try to with Wintergrasp and Tol Barad in the past, like MoP I believe? Nobody queued for them because they lacked rewards. So hopefully large BGs have an incentive!</div></div><hr />

They're listening to the majority of their playerbase. At no point should they make decisions that impact the entire game around the sub-5% of us that raid Mythic. Most of our feedback involves fucking up the game for everyone else. That's not healthy. They ARE listening to what everyone else wants, we already have the best shit. <br />
<br />
Like the loot change, I don't even like Ion but he's right. We exploit the shit out of recruits. You can see posts in this very forum from people who SHARD GEAR before giving it to recruits. That's fucked up, I've always thought that's fucked up. Being a recruit in most Mythic guilds is an awful experience, you put in the work and you get nothing for it. Loot distribution causes drama. Again, on this very forum look at all the stories of guilds disbanding over loot.<br />
<br />
this is much bigger issue then just recruits - in many loot systems like dkp/epgp etc people were exploited for years since it were always weeks before they were getting loot. <br />
<br />
people who blindly tie this only to loot council are delusional. <br />
<br />
it will be a very good change for guilds even if they dont see it now .<br />
<br />
now people will see only benefits in joining raids with guilds.</div></div><hr />

perfomance doesnt matter, since no matter how well you perform you have the same chance as anyone for loot.<br />
this is basically discourages you from giving 110% because no matter how good you are, you're only as valuable as the worst performing member, who may have literally just joined the guild, and will leave right after he gets a random loot.<br />
<br />
I've never in my life been a master looter, and yet this change makes me feel utterly punished for playing the game right.<br />
this isnt less rewarding for those &quot;who distribute it&quot; this is less rewarding for anyone who was carrying their guilds.<br />
<br />
this stands against literally everyting a guild should be about.<br />
<br />
I don't think you have raided enough to understand this. A guild leader doesn't care what your personal motivation to raid is. If you think you can just idle and get loot in my raid, then you are wrong.<br />
<br />
Things will move towards performance - as in, the reward for playing good, showing up and dedication will be raid spots - not loot.<br />
<br />
Thus a random trial can no longer create drama over loot - they will only want to be a part of the kill.<br />
No more faking being friendly and honorable until stealing a legendary and gquit at 4 in the morning.<br />
<br />
<br />
You will join a guild for a spot in a raid. Not for loot. This is fucking amazing news. <br />
<br />
The entire point of guild discussion will be - who gets the spot!<br />
<br />
The split run killing is just even better for the entire raiding community. <br />
<br />
How many hours a day you can spend in raiding is no longer that important.</div></div><hr />

What is not random is the additional component on top of that with master loot: Arbitrary human generated rules on who does or does not deserve loot after that RNG is determined.<br />
except it's not arbitrary, since a computer can literally tell youwho will benefit more from the item down to the last dps point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, your argument is that the minority of players (anywhere from 1-5%{depending on whose numbers you use}) should dictate what the other 95-99% use? <br />
what am I dictating? if the remaining 95% wants to use personal loot, then let them use it, I'm against taking away options, not dictating who should play what, that's literally the opposite of what I'm saying.<br />
<br />
remove master loot for anything that isnt mythic raids for all I care. but dont punish us for the crimes of others.<br />
<br />
BLIZZARD is dictating what I should use.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a mythic guild as yet that has said &quot;O.M.G. I can't adapt to this&quot;. I've seen individuals who blast on the forums, but never see that in game.<br />
<br />
again with the fucking adaptation.<br />
<br />
just because you can adapt to something, doesnt make it good.<br />
<br />
if you lost both your legs you'd adapt wouldnt you? but you'd still rather have your legs back. even if someone said &quot;this will be good for you in the long term&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Where and what circumstance does this cause actual harm? No convincing arguments are made in range of the developers as yet (even those relayed by community managers). Eh, what use does it do to blast folks on a forum where your arguments carry little to no value to the folks making the decision? *shrug*<br />
<br />
where loot doesnt feel rewarding and just anymore?<br />
<br />
if anyone can get the same as me in the raid, why should I try to outperform them? why not just be the one getting carried and still get equal loot?<br />
what motivation do I have to play my ass off, if I'M not being rewarded for it?<br />
<br />
blizzard is slowly but surely taking away every form of individual achievement in this game.<br />
<br />
and even looking aside the fact that some deserve more loot than others.<br />
<br />
even if all 20 players were equally deserving.<br />
<br />
you'll still end up with tons of wasted loot due to suboptimal trinkets, wrong itemization, and even if the loot isnt wasted, it'll be not optimal most of the time.<br />
<br />
like think about it, you get an item that's not that good for you but it's still a small upgrade, but it's a huge upgrade for someone else<br />
and then another item for the same slot drops that's your bis piece, so you equip it. and bam you just wasted a loot that you didnt want, and took it from someone who did.<br />
<br />
why is this good? nobody's happy in that scenario.</div></div><hr />

Still raiding mythic, however only 2 days a week due to work and Ph.D studies.<br />
<br />
I don't want anyone who gives 2 seconds of thought about loot in the guild I raid in. This is not always the case. However, it will be for any guild anytime from this point on.<br />

You don't like it, but that doesn't make it invalid. See what I did there?<br />
<br />
I'm not including your hyperbole based argument because it is silly, extreme, and not remotely relevant. Try again with something closer to context and we can talk about that.<br />
<br />
its a fundamentally terrible idea that removes an entire level of play and complexity from the game and neuters the potential of communities to form around raiding. all in the name of making sure edge cases of &quot;non-fun&quot; outcomes cant possibly happen even though mmo players have somehow managed to survive them since even before wow existed<br />
<br />

<br />
while that is true, the fact remains that it will feel infinitely less rewarding.<br />
<br />
and if the loot is diluted between the best performance and the worst ones instead of being focused, the overall performance of the guild definitely will be lowered.<br />
<br />
if you think that not only removing the reward for good performance but also rewarding bad performance the exact same way, wont lower performance on average then you're delusional. even subconsciously it can happen.<br />
<br />
anyone who says they dotn care about loot is lying to themselves. everyone does, maybe their motivations for that loot is different and the degree at which they want it. but everyone wants loot, or they wouldnt be playing an MMO.<br />
<br />
I want loot to compete on warcraftlogs, and since I perform well, I get rewarded for it cos I chose a guild where the RL isnt an idiot and rewards performance so not only my good performance helps the guild progress faster, it also helps me achieve what I want.<br />
it's literally a win win.<br />
<br />

I'm so glad the guild hoppers will leave after one clear rather than pretending to be nice to get their loot and leave in the middle of important progression.<br />

Once you get the first kill of a boss, nothing matters. Anyone can leave.<br />
<br />
Loot monkeys not faking to be potential reliable guild members is a great thing.<br />

I guess few patches. They recently came up with idea spliting que for large battlegrounds (like Alterac Valley) and typical battlegrounds. So far we have only few on &quot;large battleground&quot; list, but in the future Wintergrasp, Tol Barad and Ashran will be put there. <br />

So, even if I take the least possible cynical interpretation of your insane response, I still can't remotely see your point. <br />
<br />
I do not always agree with everything they do. But, I am also not going to argue that this loot decision is bad for the game, when it fact it is not a bad thing. It's not an edge case. It happened a disturbingly large amount until, I'd say probably this expansion when personal loot was more common than the last expansion. It started to die down around then and I welcomed it. I told my friends, and the guild in the last expansion, that personal loot would become the future. They laughed and said I was crazy. Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm not wrong.<br />
<br />
You don't like the loot system. Fine. That's a valid perspective. Do the constructive thing, propose an alternative that works for them and meets their requirements and yours. What? You don't want to be constructive and would rather vent here? OK, that's your right. But, take responsibility for not trying to be part of the improving the situation you dislike. Every choice, even inaction, carries consequences.<br />
<br />
I just had to log into my account after reading this. I really don‘t have much of an opinion on the loot decision at all, but your posts are really painful to read. You are actively criticizing people for things you do yourself. You think that you have the moral highground and your opinion is a fact. PETA much?</div></div><hr />

That happens now anyway. At least now they will not be potentially taking valuable loot with them that someone gave to them over one of the people who don't quit. <br />
<br />
I wonder if it would make sense to pair this change up with a way through the Game UI to put up a piece of eligible loot in your inventory as a &quot;greed roll&quot;. It drops for you and you can either take it like usual, or &quot;pass&quot; and have it go to greed for any eligible participants. Something to make it easier for people to make use of the trade option rather than just shrug and vendor it.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe the Horde is evil, but there is so much more in the Horde's history that can back-up the idea that they are evil for someone who wants to view them that way. The Alliance simply just doesn't have this at the moment.<br />
<br />
Yes the Alliance have questionable actions in their past. Yes the Alliance can sometimes go a little too far, but everything is padded with 'They didn't know this' or 'The Horde did this, so it was just a reaction'. It's far more easy to excuse the actions of the Alliance than the Horde, especially with Horde leaders swinging between radically evil actions and extremely altruistic actions (Their character, history and personality be damned).<br />
<br />
The problem, right now, that most Horde players who aren't crying about winning or losing, but simply about the Horde YET AGAIN being the aggressor, the unethical, the genocidal, the cruel, the destructive is that it's us YET AGAIN. The Alliance could stand to benefit, story wise, from actually taking an aggressive step and adding some grey into their character and having some internal conflict that leaves their leadership questionable and their ultimate goal hazy.<br />
<br />
But Blizzard doesn't seem capable of doing this. The only thing we have, telling us the factions are morally grey and that they are equally good or bad, is you Ion and other devs saying so in interviews. Put it in the game. Not in a book, not in an anecdotal piece in Chronicles.<br />
<br />
Put it in the game. Put the Alliances crimes in the game. And make them bigger than 'That one time one twat killed four people in a kind of shitty way.'<br />
<br />
Honestly i miss thralls noble horde. The place for misfits but actually a place. Instead of one group holding all the power(i feel thrall listened to other leaders and was more understanding) <br />

<br />
as they should? the &quot;scaling&quot; fiasco and arbitrary adjustments are going to be the end of this game. or at least the &quot;rpg&quot; part of mmorpg. what little of that is left.</div></div><hr />

Inflammatory? Oh, very nice. You do not annoy me at all. I just wanted to reassure the people whose opinions you are trying to diminish that their arguments are not invalid. <br />
<br />
Constructive with regard to what? This thing is called a comment, I don‘t want to give you any advice on how to fix your attitude.</div></div><hr />

Slightly different eye color and backstory, but if you want to be a light skinned elf, that is basically a Blood Elf. Giving that to the Alliance would blur the line between factions.<br />
<br />
Blur the line between factions... what about pandaren they are the same in both factions so pure bs.<br />
<br />
There aren't a ton of High Elves out there in WoW.<br />
<br />
There are more High Elves then Void Elves so again bullshit reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
laughed so hard on this one! WoW plays akwardly slow (exeption being maybe shadow playing with S2M), but slowing it down even more and making specs that use their CDs very frequently just makes the game even more clunky. Kind of a weird perception of their own game.<br />
<br />
only if your bad. or havent played any other mmos since like - ever. but to be fair, for millenials 9/10 times this is their first mmorpg.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oathy</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly i miss thralls noble horde. The place for misfits but actually a place. Instead of one group holding all the power(i feel thrall listened to other leaders and was more understanding) <br />
<br />
Instead just agression agression agression ever since cata<br />
<br />
Im actually wondering has anyone on the team recently played right through the silverpine quest chain.<br />
main reason I say this. After just completed the Horde Scenario on beta. the &quot;meh&quot; nature Brill/UC are lost<br />
just flies in the face of a much deeper storyline and the actual passion they put into her performance how much she does care.<br />
<br />
they had the perfect chance some time ago to start a storyline that actually made sense why we are hating each other again<br />
We seem to flip from a world wide threat. to a psycho out of control horde leader depending on expansion.<br />
<br />
The comments from saurfang alone mean either he's never coming back or suprise suprise we are taking the Dark Lady down <br />
another Horde on horde expansion...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm so THRILLED to have lost so many abilities since MoP. So THRILLED to feel a sense of dread, rather than excitement, when I scroll through the changes to my class in the Alpha to see removed, removed, removed...<br />
<br />
so many abilities lost? I have more hotkeys on my actionbars than ive ever had. repurposed sure. homogonized, yea you bet. but lost as in less than before? hardly. they prune because they bloat. every xpac is mudflation at its finest. <br />
<br />
know the last time eq/ffxi/ffxiv/eq2 yada yada yada yada had a &quot;squish&quot; yea u guessed it.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
what are you talking about?<br />
perfomance doesnt matter, since no matter how well you perform you have the same chance as anyone for loot.<br />
this is basically discourages you from giving 110% because no matter how good you are, you're only as valuable as the worst performing member, who may have literally just joined the guild, and will leave right after he gets a random loot.<br />
<br />
I've never in my life been a master looter, and yet this change makes me feel utterly punished for playing the game right.<br />
this isnt less rewarding for those &quot;who distribute it&quot; this is less rewarding for anyone who was carrying their guilds.<br />
<br />
this stands against literally everyting a guild should be about.<br />
<br />
more actionmmo less mmorpg. been saying this for like..10 years? since post bc started the cucking</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirCowdog</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why is this good? nobody's happy in that scenario.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is happy. Because it allows them to better predict and control how long content lasts. <br />
<br />
When you look at all the changes that have been made in recent history, virtually every one of them is removing player agency in favor of Blizzard's ability to control and set the pace at the cost of player agency. <br />
<br />
Why? Business model. Money. It all comes down to the monthly subscription profits and stretching them any way possible. <br />
<br />
In before white knights say they could do that by making the game more fun: <br />
<br />
Fun is too subjective. Why bank on some ambiguous concept when you can set the pace with hard numbers? WoW is set up to work like a casino. Sure, some games are a little better odds than others, but in the end, the odds are set by the house to be profitable, not fun. The problem we're seeing more and more of is that Blizzard is pushing that line further and further towards profit, and further and further away from fun. <br />
<br />
But whatever, addicts. Keep defending it. Keep giving Blizzard money without thinking. YOU are the reason they're doing this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirCowdog</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't like the loot system. Fine. That's a valid perspective. Do the constructive thing, propose an alternative that works for them and meets their requirements and yours. <br />
<br />
Which would be a great suggestion if blizzard didn't completely ignore every piece of feedback and tell players &quot;We're doing things Ion's way, and if you don't like it too bad.&quot; <br />
<br />
All you have to do is look at the recent interview to see the truth of that. Every concern players brought up was brushed aside or ignored.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oathy</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing is utterly certain if this goes the same way as cata. Remember that lovely graph that showed the drop off?<br />
people much higher than Mr Hazzikostas will take notice. fortnite is stealing all the headlines at the expense of Overwatch<br />
whether they like it or not. <br />
<br />
Remember all the fuss they made about Twitter updates? how many hours went into that mess.<br />
at the end of the day they can add 30 playable races. If the classes or Game design dont feel right <br />
playing using a different model isnt going to make a lot of difference.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Interim</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, remember in the good olt times where trinkets arcane power pom and pyro were all on separate GCDs<br />
<br />
oh wait.<br />
<br />
you people are acting like this is a new thing when GCDless cooldowns were in the game since vanilla.<br />
<br />
wrath of the lich king was way faster than anything today.<br />
<br />
the game didnt &quot;get too fast&quot; at all<br />
<br />
it's already slowed down quite a bit, the only difference is that now it'Ll also feel uncomfortable and clunky as well as slow.<br />
<br />
itll feel clunky and slow cuase that button you press once every 2-3mins is now on the gcd? jesus. millenials</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the lull after the Legion high. Seems the every other expansion sucks trend continues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hugh Wattmate</div><div class="date">2018-04-26, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, but there is a good side of it. It stops boost runs, so that reduces amount of spam and scams, which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
I don't really mind boost runs happening. If people want to spend gold on a mount and others are willing to sell it power to them. I'm guessing this won't be an issue but what if the mount dropped for someone who already had it. Could it be traded then?</div></div><hr />
