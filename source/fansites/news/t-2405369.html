You know a lot of people really, REALLY hated the Wrath and Cata login screens. Hearing those roars, and that *flap, flap, flap* over and over really grated on people, myself included.<br />
<br />
We actually asked Blizz for simpler, less annoying login screens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, because no one complained about the dragons screaming at you when you loaded in, and tried to log in as fast as possible before they made their wretched noise.<br />
<br />
<br />
...oh wait, they did!<br />
<br />
In fact those login screens were pretty hated by everyone.<br />
<br />
But suddenly...they're loved now?<br />
<br />
oh.<br />
<br />
okay.<br />

I actually like it. The music + the new login screen is pretty cool. You guys have to stop complaining about everything. It’s actually a fun and promising expansion imo (yes I have beta)</div></div><hr />

I'm with you, it's too... simple and somewhat Alliance Biased, I get to stare at the lost horde city/battle all expansion. Alliance would have said the same thing if it was Teldrassil. Should have been more neutral. (I was also a fan of Wrath, wish we could just pick login screens)<br />
<br />
But oh well, we'll see it for a whopping few seconds each time anyway.</div></div><hr />

Uhm... I think you may have it wrong.<br />
<br />
It's Sylvannas and her Forsaken Undead against the Living and the Alliance. There are Horde also questioning her actions.<br />
The precursor to these events is the Night Elves home Teldrassil gets attacked and Sylvannas is plotting to grow her Forsaken army.<br />
<br />
The title Battle For Azeroth isn't a battle to who can claim the land, it's a Battle to Save Azeroth after Sargeras impaled the planet at the end of Legion expansion and the planet is literally dying.<br />
<br />
So would hardly say it's Orc vs Human expac.<br />

<br />
The leveling zones and questlines are better than the legion ones for sure. The new dungeons are fun if you only do them ONCE. But otherwise... the whole expansion is trash. War mode is a joke, minimal reward for huge grinding. PVP will be even worse because the faction unbalance is getting out of hand. World pvp will be killed by the pvp off mode. Noone will do WQ-s in PVP mode, trust me. Farming dungeons are the worst: those are too big, too much trash, too long and so much RP. Forced Personal loot will kill a lot of guild.<br />
Nothing new.<br />
PL loot coused my guild to make 4 raid teams: cloth classes + 2 tanks, leather classes, mail classes + 2 tanks, plate classes. Pure cancer.<br />
<br />
The login screen is more like a political campaign for America Red vs Blue. The wall is too empty for me. It feels like I am in a prison and I want to esape. Although I like the whole simplicity of the login screen.</div></div><hr />

Yep pretty much a case for Blizzard of stuffed if they do or stuffed if they don't.. Funny thing is unless you login at the login screen which most people I would imagine don't, you don't see the login screen for long anyway..</div></div><hr />

the login screen is a likely a temporary 2D image and doesn't represent the final 3D model login screen. if this was using 3D game assets the equivalent loading screen would look abhorrent. <br />

<br />
Sucks that the Expansion itself is shit...<br />
<br />
You are shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Subjective I guess .... because I personally think the login screen looks fantastic.</div></div><hr />

Well, he replied to you in the same constructive manner as you judging the expansion. But I guess saying 'the expansion is shit' is considered good criticism among the mmo-chumps. :)</div></div><hr />

Not everything has to be roaring dragon or two fools with smiley faces on their kneecaps, but this, imho, is just bland.</div></div><hr />

It's very Warcraft, so that has it going for it. It's not a dragon screaming in my face and it's not green, so that's cool too.</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to bet 1 internet that this will still be the case when this patch goes live. Who is with me??!??!? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the first expansion launch without Chris Metzen or Russell Brower, and it shows. That's not to say that BfA will be bad, but it is already obvious it won't be the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Love the login screen, reminds me of Reign of Chaos.<br />
<br />
Absolutely!</div></div><hr />

It's depressing as Hell. Like, we all gonna die. It's a screen you get to see when you lose the battle. What a good thing to motivate people.</div></div><hr />
