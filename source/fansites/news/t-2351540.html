Allied Race Intro Text - Highmountain Tauren<br />
Patch 7.3.5 adds some dialogue lines for the Highmountain Tauren Allied Race (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7186-Battle-for-Azeroth-Allied-Races) intro.<br />
<br />
Summoned to the Embassy<br />
Players are summoned to the embassy to choose between the Highmountain Tauren and Nightborne as the first Allied Race to pursue. <br />
Nathanos Blightcaller - The Dark Lady instructs you to meet me in Orgrimmar.<br />
Nathanos Blightcaller - Information has come to light crucial to the interests of the Horde. It is imperative we remain a step ahead of our rivals.<br />
Nathanos Blightcaller - Meet me outside Grommash Hold. Keep this quiet... or the consequences will be swift and severe.<br />
<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - You have observed our operations in Silithus. Clearly the Alliance is doing everything in its power to undermine our efforts.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - The Horde's selfless leadership in the war against the Legion has left our ranks depleted. Our enemies slaver at the thought of stealing what is ours. We will not let them.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - I've authorized the building of an embassy in Orgrimmar. From it, we will win others to our cause. Meet me there at once.<br />
<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Leaders of the Horde, I summoned you here--along with one of our greatest champions--because our enemies are gathering their strength.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - The Alliance is scouring the far corners of Azeroth in search of every advantage against us. We must do the same.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - War is coming. We need fresh blood added to the ranks of the Horde. What say you?<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Warchief, the tauren of Highmountain fought boldly alongside us in our campaign against the Burning Legion, just as our ancestors did long ago.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - I have invited their leaders to a great feast in Mulgore. This could be a chance to bring them to our side.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - A simple people, but strong. They would be a boon on the battlefield.<br />
Lady Liadrin -I too have a suggestion, Warchief. The sin'dorei have maintained diplomatic ties with the nightborne since we helped liberate Suramar from the Legion.<br />
Lady Liadrin -The regent lord and I agree that our kingdoms have much in common. We believe the nightborne would make valuable allies.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Even without the Nightwell, Suramar holds vast arcane resources. A most useful arrow added to my quiver.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Each option would have its uses. I believe (player) knows both these peoples. Which potential ally do you suggest we pursue first?<br />
<br />
<br />
Highmountain Chosen<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - Chieftain Bloodhoof, have our champion join you for your feast in Thunder Bluff. By the time dessert is served, I want their oath of loyalty to the Horde.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - It shall be so, Warchief.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thunder Bluff Feast<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Thank you for coming, Mayla. It is my honor to welcome you to Mulgore.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Your invitation was most kind, Baine. It is time for our two peoples to renew our bonds of kinship.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - It is of kinship that I wish to speak. I hope that--<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I should never... have left... the mountain...<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Ebonhorn! What dark force grips you?<br />
Baine Bloodhoof	- I know this power all too well. Champion! We need your help!<br />
Mayla Highmountain - I must get Ebonhorn back to Highmountain at once!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Until we discover what's behind this attack, Mulgore will never be safe. I will come with you, Mayla. Let us face this darkness together.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defending Thunder Bluff<br />
Uul'gyneth - Destroy them! They must not hinder my return!<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Mayla... the pools...<br />
Mayla Highmountain - I understand, my friend. Baine, I must get Ebonhorn back to Highmountain.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Very well. We will drive this Old God filth from Thunder Bluff.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Your masters will not take my city, monster!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - We will drive your shadow from Mulgore!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Hahahaha! It feels good to swing my mace again!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Thunder Bluff will be free of you!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Go back to the void that spawned you!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Go to Highmountain and aid Mayla, champion. I will join you soon.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - I must be certain the Old Gods' minions are driven from Mulgore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Saving Spiritwalker Ebonhorn<br />
Mayla Highmountain - The waters have soothed Ebonhorn, but I fear he is slipping away.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Ebonhorn is not well. We must find a way to bring him back from the brink. Speak with Spiritwalker Graysky. I believe he can help.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - I will remain here while Graysky aids you. Pray that restoring the wards will mend Ebonhorn's mind.<br />
<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - The whispers... they have stopped. Thank you, champion, Graysky.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - My mind is my own again. Return to Thunder Totem, champion. Let us gather strength for what is to come.<br />
<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Champion! Graysky told me of your courage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uul'gyneth Backstory<br />
Mayla Highmountain - But our work is not done yet. Ebonhorn, we must know what this Darkness wants.<br />
<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Follow me, champion.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Long ago, the Old Gods sought to lay claim to Highmountain. Their campaign was led by a terrible general... Uul'gyneth the Darkness.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Huln gathered heroes from among the tribes to stand together. They fought against Uul'gyneth's servants, the Necrodark... but the forces of shadow were too great to overcome.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - So Huln devised another plan. Wards were placed to lock away the Old Gods' influence. Though the general survived, Uul'gyneth's essence was trapped.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - So the Necrodark have been lurking in the shadows, waiting to call forth their master.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Indeed. And when I left the mountain to visit Mulgore, the wards weakened just enough to let the Darkness take hold.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - The last ward was placed at Highmountain Summit. That is where we must go. Just as Huln stood with his allies, so we must band together.<br />
<br />
Uul'gyneth - Yes... come! Your strength will become ours, child of darkness!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Child of... What does he mean?<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I... cannot say. Mayla, you and I must go on ahead. Baine, you and our champion gather the others and meet us at the summit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uul'gyneth Battle<br />
Uul'gyneth - This mountain belongs to us, mortals. You will soon become vessels for this world's true power!<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - These heroes do not stand alone.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Together, we will banish your darkness!<br />
Uul'gyneth - You will serve us, dragon, just as Neltharion did! Your kind always bends to the whispers.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - I cannot let the Darkness possess my father's body!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Mayla! We must stand together!<br />
Uul'gyneth - Serve your true masters, drogbar! Your defiance means death!<br />
Uul'gyneth - The Skyhorn shall serve my masters! You will become the shadow that darkens the skies!<br />
Uul'gyneth - The Legion was nothing compared to our power! Surrender!<br />
Uul'gyneth - You have failed! The Darkness rises... and Highmountain shall fall!<br />
Uul'gyneth - The wards have weakened! He will be ours!<br />
<br />
<br />
Uul'gyneth Defeated<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I am free from the Old Gods' grip. Thank you, my friends.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - I did not realize that I had invited a dragon to feast with us at Thunder Bluff. Had I known, I might have set a bigger table!<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - Only Mayla and our champion knew my secret before. Now I entrust it to you as well, chieftain.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - I see no reason for anyone else to know, spiritwalker. Let it be a matter kept... between friends.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Today was very nearly a dark day for Azeroth.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Had Uul'gyneth's plan succeeded, we all would have been made into servants of the Old Gods... including Ebonhorn.<br />
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn - I shudder at the thought, Mayla. Without the swift action of Baine and this champion, all would have been lost.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Baine Bloodhoof, you have demonstrated courage, honor, and loyalty. I believe it is time for your people and mine to renew our bonds of kinship.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - If you will have us, the tauren of Highmountain would be proud to join your Horde.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - The Horde will be honored to welcome you! Let us travel to Orgrimmar and share the good news with our Warchief.<br />
<br />
<br />
Highmountain Tauren Join the Horde<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner, I present Chieftain Mayla Highmountain.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - What have you to say, chieftain?<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Warchief, the strength and courage of the Horde has been demonstrated by Baine Bloodhoof, as well as your champion.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - From this day forth, Highmountain vows to stand with you against all foes.<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - I accept your oath of loyalty. The Horde offers its protection... and expects your obedience.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof - For the Horde!<br />
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner - For the Horde!<br />
Mayla Highmountain - For the Horde!<br />
<br />
<br />
Highmountain Tauren Player Intro<br />
Mayla Highmountain - For many ages, our people have called the Broken Isles home. We know little about the Azeroth that exists beyond our shores.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - It is time we changed that.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Today you begin a new journey. You will be our voice in the lands beyond the mountain.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Go to Orgrimmar. Meet our new allies and learn what it is they care about... what they fight for.<br />
Mayla Highmountain - Stay true to who you are. And should you ever miss your home, know that Highmountain is here for you. Always.<br />

Frankly Aggramar really isn't that tough; the Coven and Kin'garoth are more difficult. Aggramar is like playing a revision of Ragnaros.</div></div><hr />

Gameplay does not equal lore.<br />

<br />
Only in Stormheim do you go as a representative of your faction. Highmountain, Suramar, Azshara, and Val'sharah are all done as a representative of your respective Class Order. You did not help the Highmountain Tauren as a member of the Alliance, you helped them as the Highlord of the Silver Hand if you were a Paladin, as an example.</div></div><hr />

I kind of expected Highmountain and Lightforged to pull the kin cards. However, still kinda shocked that Nightbourn/Dark Irons/Velf's weren't given the panda treatment. I only mention DI as a neutral since their race used to be based on treachery and being brutal. Not to mention, once Moira's kiddo grows up, that leaves room for a power struggle/internal conflict within the council of three hammers. <br />
<br />
High hopes I guess.</div></div><hr />

See, I really like this and I hope every Allied Race takes a similar tack with how they join their factions; it’s not them saying “Go kill Alliance/Horde scum! Glory for our team! RAWR!!!”, it’s keeping in mind that these races are mostly strangers to the greater world, they were assisted by members of both factions so it becomes as much about education, learning about how things work beyond the homeland(s), and just seeing what the chosen faction’s values are/what’s worth fighting for (thanks Chen!). And the last line is especially cool, saying “Hey, new Allied Race person, if the world outside makes you feel too uncomfortable or becomes too much to bear, you can always come home.”</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not that shocking though.<br />
<br />
You can pretty much blame Tyrande for providing the final push against the Nightborne, the Dark Iron are now an integral part of the Alliance and Void Elves we're rallied by Alleria who is pro-Alliance after being kicked out of the Sin'dorei society.<br />
<br />
Shocking would have been the Lightforge joining the Horde or the Highmountain joining the Alliance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just don't understand why the WOW devs seem so afraid of giving us more options to customize our characters. The game is 13 years old and we STILL cannot customize more than the same few hair / color / jewelry options. A couple of subraces for each race, plus a one time free (sub)-race change, would have been AWESOME. But nope. Tattoos? Nope. Skin paint? Nope. Customizable hair, face, features, color, etc? Nope nope nope nope.<br />
<br />
An RPG should be all about making a unique player character. FFS, Fallout 4 has more character RPG elements than WoW -- and that is not saying very much at all.</div></div><hr />

As long as at least one hero is exalted with all of the legion factions, it's excusable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So am I, but for completely different reasons. As Alliance we spend lots of time helping out Highmountain and Suramar and what do they do? Turn on us? Horde was also up to their armpits in Argus too, but that whole chapter felt very short. <br />
<br />
I'd rather they shared the allied races among both Horde and Alliance or at least give Alliance the Vrykul as an Allied race. Why did Alliance even bother getting involved in the Broken Isles politics when we just get spat at by those we helped out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
From a patch data perspective they weren't. They were added in 7.0.1 which came with ALL of the expansion content. Just the vast majority of it happened to be locked. <br />
<br />
They however were added before the rest of the content was unlocked. But this is different. Other then allied races there is no BFA content in the game such as Kul'Tiras zone maps, or npcs. In fact they also don't have Zandalari Trolls or Dark Iron Dwarves AT ALL. The only hint at them on the PTR is a couple of ability icons.</div></div><hr />

No need to be sarcastic, I'm actually trying to understand in here :|<br />
<br />
Content isn't added at the last minute. If something is ready, even if it's not supposed to be released right away, it's sometimes included in the next patch anyway. That's why you can sometimes datamine future patches content.</div></div><hr />

The chance to get the Zandalari comes during the 110-120 leveling story. The other two come before them and can be done at 110.</div></div><hr />
