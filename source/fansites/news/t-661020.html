<br />
<br />
you are wrong, it was useable but without dmg.<br />
Nice ultility to enter the fight in arena games vs rogues because you don´t need it and its a range attack.<br />
Also good to keep ppl infight like rogues who want to reset or interupt drinking on range without using some long CD spells.<br />
<br />
Vezax wasn´t bugged they increased the number of shadowcrashes before so you can have a 90+% uptime ... the problem was that this &quot;buff&quot; was e nerf because you lost a lot of DPS while running out of the dangerzone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, for normal mode, with good execution, more shadow crashes can be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
vezax also lost a chunk of hp. This and the 2 vapors earlyer hardmode is probably to get rid of special specs to do the hard mode successfully. I didnt change specs, stayed ttw/fire, and still had 1500-1600 mana to spare without using a dark rune.</div></div><hr />

damn it... why do we even bother wiping? now we'll down him for sure :&gt;<br />
<br />
do these nerfs apply to both 10 and 25 man?</div></div><hr />

I havent been to 10 man yet this week, this was on 25 man</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DiamondTear</div><div class="date">2009-08-09, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vez was casting crash way too often. I assume it was a bug related to the hp nerf.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">free4al</div><div class="date">2009-08-09, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. That means those ret's who thought &quot;OMG FREE DPSLOL&quot; won't be fucking with the tanks in their raids, and as for me? Well, least i won't wasting mana and a cooldown by hitting the wrong key, or hitting it, but it not having any effect due to diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
U do realize that they will still use it on TAUNTABLE targets if they wanna fuck around with their tanks ... and yes its OMG FREE DPS, so why not use ability thats on 8 sec cd, not uses gcd and does truckload of dmg on target that cant be taunted ( that doesn't make any changes to the fight at all )<br />
<br />
and why not use it on vezax when he's taunt immune, and why not use it on players ( to keep em in combat ), or to get yourself in combat<br />
<br />
will that apply for XT heart, kologarn arms, mimirons body, yogg tentacles /brain, hodirs flash freezes ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ronik2k2</div><div class="date">2009-08-09, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I think happened with Vezax is they normalized his casting. So he was more likely to cast things the moment they became available. This was wonderful for interupts this week, the Flame Crash was coming at very regular intervals and was easy to anticipate.<br />
<br />
Shadow Crash on the other hand, was casting so often that the ranged had periods of time where they could not stop to DPS. So this is very much a fix.<br />
<br />
He lost 9 million hp (now 23 down from 32), and the Animus spawns on 6th Cloud. Animus lost a few hp too, but I forget how much.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexe</div><div class="date">2009-08-09, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They lowered the hp and made the animus spawn at 6 instead of 8 because they nerfed the enhancement shaman heal spec to cause a healing debuff when you gain mana from stormstrike. Basically guilds used enhancement shamans to heal and now they get a healing debuff, so basically the difficulty is about the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Read again ... &quot; targets that are immune to taunt &quot;<br />
No decent ret would have taunted on a non immune boss so I dunno what you are raging about.<br />
<br />
Well it was fun while it lasted but the fix was expected even sooner as we pointed this out during testing.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Also, i'm not being funny<br />
<br />
Yeah, play the class then think you're funny. Ret got slammed this patch, smartass. They also retooled Holy's entire style, wanting to get away from 'one button healing'. Thank God Shammys can one button CH and never run out of mana now.<br />
<br />
One fix Begets another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
was probably moreso that tanks got a good avoidance nerf, thus taking more damage, thus the fight needing to be shorter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it was OP, rogues should always be able to get a sap off ofcourse.<br />

<br />
Only as often as paladins should be able to get off bubble, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't have a dot/stealth debuff, then you aren't. Even if you do, its only supposed to work if the rogue doesn't have the CD to clear it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Less shadow crashes are actually a boss buff. Now this means more time without the effect. :( WTB moar shadow crashes</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Let me quote myself from page 2:<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Crash on the other hand, was casting so often that the ranged had periods of time where they could not stop to DPS.* So this is very much a fix.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kallass</div><div class="date">2009-08-10, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But they lowered the time lack between his Searing Flame cast, we needed two Shamans for spamming Wind Shock to interrupt him, about every 4-5 seconds comes a new cast.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">atroxes</div><div class="date">2009-08-10, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Rogue, doing the interrupting on Vezax, I can safely say that the change to Searing Flames is insane. Unless he is silenced, he will not stop casting Searing Flames. At the very instant he is no longer school-locked by a Rogue 5 sec Kick interrupt, he will begin casting again. This means that you can no longer have 2x Shamans interrupting on the Animus phase as there is a good chance that the 2 second gap in interrupts (2x 2 sec school-lock, 6 sec CD on interrupt, 2 sec gap) will eventually wipe the raid. You can add a 3rd Shaman on interrupt duty, but that borders on stacking and having 3x Elemental/Enhancement isn't exactly a standard raid setup.<br />
<br />
We managed to kill him+animus however last night, for the first time, so I guess you can say that he's easier, although I didn't exactly find him easy as one of the 2 Rogues interrupting. I found him to be an utter pain to fight againt now. The old Vezax was way more &quot;fun&quot; to play against, because you'd have all the same tasks, but on a more relaxed time table and you could focus more on fighting him than just spamming your Kick button every 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Worked since before the patch. How's this change going to affect that then?<br />
<br />
Also, rather lacking rogue weapons in 3.2 T_T</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolo</div><div class="date">2009-08-10, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erm...fail? Before you rage and say stupid things about classes you have no knowledge of, do a bit of research. CH is *not* an effective raid healing spell in WotLK. For Resto Shamans, the main healing spell is Lesser Healing Wave (LHW) supplemented by Riptide (RT) and Chain Heal (CH) for Tidal Waves procs; the healing rotation for a Resto Shaman without the T8 4-set set bonus (lowered CD on Riptide) is RT&gt;LHW&gt;LHW&gt;CH&gt;LHW&gt;LHW&gt;Repeat. With the T8 4-set bonus, the rotation is RT&gt;LHW&gt;LHW&gt;Repeat. Notice that neither of those go CH&gt;CH&gt;CH&gt;CH. Please have at least a basic understanding of the class you're QQing about in future as failing to have this basic grounding in class knowledge makes you look like a total moron. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, its for procs. However I'm sure 8k HPS is totally normal, which is what our shaman did last night on IC hardmode. But then again CH is really ineffective and was barely used at all.<br />
