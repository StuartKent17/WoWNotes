A teaser on the official Warcraft Facebook Page (http://www.facebook.com/Warcraft/posts/194142790650384) hints at two new types of NPCs coming in a future patch, most likely Patch 4.3: the Transmogrifier and Void Storage NPCs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transmogrifier&quot; seems to hint at a way to change the appearance of something, the first thing coming to my mind is either a way to change the look of your items (it was experimented in the past with things such as Darkspear Overcloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75693/darkspear-overcloak/) but dropped later). I guess it could also be a way to change facial/body features on characters.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Void Storage&quot; is probably ... well, another kind of storage? Or a high-tech magic trash can. <br />
<br />

These questions will have to be addressed: Will it act like Reforging? (e.g., the vendor right next to him?) Will you put the &quot;pretty&quot; item in one slot, the &quot;stat&quot; item in the other slot, and click &quot;Transmogrify&quot; for a fee? Can you undo the change or is it permanent? Do you get both items back if you undo the change?</div></div><hr />

hope so, maybe a precursor for being able to send BoA gear cross server, which i think will make a lot of people happy.</div></div><hr />

Like most of his inventions, it was made originally from a cardboard box (http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/Cardboard_box), though a later model (http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/Transmogrifier_Gun) was made using a water gun. Calvin used the transmogrifiers many times, turning himself and Hobbes (http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/Hobbes) into quite a wide array of creatures. The transmogrifier first appeared on March 23 (http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/March_23), 1987 (http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/1987). Clearly a reference.</div></div><hr />

Void Storage: Bank that is accessible from every char of your account.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThewF</div><div class="date">2011-08-11, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my theory / educated guess. <br />
<br />
Transmogrifier<br />
- Ability to use modify Armor Colors, Weapon Colors, Armor Models, Weapon Models, etc. This would essentially be a fix for people who dislike having mismatched pieces of armor between Tiers which is something that popped up more frequently with Tier 11 and Tier 12.<br />
- Ability to re-customize characters, Race / Gender will be locked but Facial Features, Jewelry, Skin Color, etc will be re-customizable.<br />
- Something new we haven't thought of, such as the ability to use Costumes like many other games have implemented (an example would be Guild Wars).<br />
<br />
Void Storage<br />
- This in my opinion sounds like Blizzards cross-realm trading feature, I'm thinking that you deposit items into your &quot;Void Storage&quot; for a gold cost and you can then withdraw said items on any realm by visiting a Void Storage NPC. This would allow people to Cross-Realm Trade Bind on Equip and Bind on Account items which again has frequently been a requested feature with Tier 11 &amp; Tier 12.<br />
<br />
I have no other ideas but this just seems to make sense to me, they are features that have been requested for years and I'm pretty sure Cross-Realm BoA / Void Storage was hinted at in a Previous Blue post but I'm unable to find it. Something about how Blizzard is experimenting with options to allow cross-realm BoA transer.</div></div><hr />

I doubt Blizzard, if they even introduced the feature to begin with, would allow you to transform the look of your items into something that's not in your inventory, so unless you know something I don't, then I don't think we'll be seeing many Atieshes. And besides, if EVERYBODY starts using Thunderfury, then the much cooler thing would be to use something else, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
As for transferring items across servers... don't be silly. Blizzard has been saying they've been investigating how to do this forever. I still wonder why so many people believe that Blizzard is some kind of nexus of infinite corporate evil or something, conspiring to steal all of our dollars.<br />

They are copying 2 mechanics from Aion:<br />
<br />
Transmogrifier: You can transform the looks of one of your items to another item. Example: Make your ugly lvl 85 swords look like your old warglaives. <br />
<br />
Void Storage: Bank that is accessible from every char of your account.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that the void storage will be for specific items only... like tier sets, benediction, stuff that you can't really use any more but you want to keep for the looks... perhaps they'd allow unlimited storage for soulbound items. This would lend itself to the transmogrifier which some suggest could allow you to use the looks of old 'soulbound' gear.<br />
<br />
That said, I'd prefer void storage be b.net/cross realm bank, but I that seems too good to be true.</div></div><hr />

They've said in the past it's something they'd like to do (can't find the post). Shared storage would be awesome. They've also said they want to make storage and bags in general easier to navigate. I wonder if that'd somehow be included too?<br />
<br />
As for the transmogrifier, I'd personally be surprised if they went the whole &quot;appearance tab&quot; route. I don't think that's coming yet, if ever. Also, huge 'win' for there being ethereals again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying they're an evil corporation, but they're a business; simple as that. Profit will always be part of their agenda, and with a reduced need for people to migrate (many people migrate to new servers for several reasons; one of which is often to move their heirlooms for a fresh start, myself included), there will no doubt be reduced profits. I foresee heirlooms being restricted on this at least.</div></div><hr />

Like most of his inventions, it was made originally from a cardboard box, though a later model was made using a water gun. Calvin used the transmogrifiers many times, turning himself and Hobbes into quite a wide array of creatures. The transmogrifier first appeared on March 23, 1987. Clearly a reference.<br />
<br />
Except that &quot;transmogrify&quot; and by extension &quot;transmogrifier&quot; are words that date back to the 17th century. It could well be a reference, but I'm not seeing anything else there that suggests it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're assuming it needs to be an Either/Or thing where Blizzard EITHER gives their customers new features OR screws them out of money on transfers. The reality is, I'm sure, they've got a team of MBAs doing cost-benefit analysis on this stuff figuring out just how much the customer base is willing to put up with while still resubbing each month.</div></div><hr />

You think they would do that? You know what this means right? <br />
<br />
Heirlooms in bank -&gt; Easy access to heirlooms on another server -&gt; drastically reduced need to migrate -&gt; Less money for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
True, but that assumes people frequently transfer for that express purpose. The other side is that if people want to start over on a new server, they'll probably spend time leveling/gearing up their new character - which means it would keep people paying their subscription fees.<br />
<br />
Either way, we're talking about a trifling sum, though. I can't imagine more than a few people a week character transfer SPECIFICALLY to move heirlooms (most of the time, you'd move heirlooms along with a max-level character you're moving to your new server anyway). If you're really moving for a &quot;fresh-start&quot;, you're probably burned out on whatever you're currently doing, and those are the people who are otherwise most likely to cancel their subscription. <br />
<br />
So even from a financial standpoint, cross-realm banking is a win for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
(That said, not saying for sure that this is what the addition of the &quot;void storage&quot; guy implies - there are any number of things that it could be. Only that I wouldn't rule it out)</div></div><hr />

I can do the math pretty easily in my head without needing an MBA in finances... if introducing a feature would keep an appreciable portion of their customer base (remember that only a very SMALL portion of the customer base uses the faction transfer system) subscribing for exactly one more month than they would have otherwise, then they would get more money.<br />
<br />
How many people honestly use faction transfers to transfer heirlooms? That's silly. Almost every single faction transfer is because somebody wants to transfer their main (as in their main, not a new character) to another server in order to play with friends or a new guild.<br />
<br />
That said, somebody else's point of it potentially being storage for soulbound items makes a lot of sense too.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that would work as daggers have different animations.<br />
IF this is what we think it is it will be<br />
1 handers<br />
Daggers<br />
2 handers<br />
Polearms/staves<br />
<br />

They share animations, if you could for instance change your balanced heartseeker into a reforged arcanite reaper you'd be stabbing with a 2handed axe wich, while amusing, wouldn't make any sense.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is likely a look at new features. It is possible that the Transmogrifier is a 'Appearance Tab' type option. (No, Blizz will not remove the PvP noticability out. If it IS an 'Appearance Tab', it will be disabled in BGs and Arena's.) However, it is more likely that it will function as an in-game facial modifier, so you're not stuck with the same face for years and years. Much like the Barber-shop. No, it is not going to be Account-wide storage/transfers. Blizz has said that they are a long way off from accomplishing this. Blizzard also recently said they've been looking into upgrading the amount of bank storage space. Most likely, the Void Storage is just that-a new, larger bank. POSSIBLY a Server-wide bank, but not Account-wide.</div></div><hr />

As for the Transmogrifier, my guess is a variation on the &quot;appearance tab&quot; idea where we put the stat item in, then an item from our inventory, and it transmogrifies the stat item to have the look of the other item. Disabled in PvP, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It may work somewhat like reforging, where the stats of one item are converted to those of a second item completely. So what ends up happening is you have one item that looks really cool but has crappy stats and a second item that has awesome stats but a crappy graphic, so, you basically get to convert the stats on the cool looking one to the stats of the crappy looking one. <br />
<br />
As item models in WoW are basically like a single large sticker you wrap around a frame, I highly doubt you will be able to customize individual colors on a piece of armor. That would require re-creating every single item in the game with a different skin/model system. Swapping item stats back and worth is a more of a character database change that only changes numbers much like the current reforging system. <br />
<br />
So in essence, it will be a complete stat reforger onto a different item model, but not a truly, fully customizable system.</div></div><hr />

Actually, think about it; if everybody starts using Thunderfury and Warglaives with this, then suddenly, the in thing would be to use an unusual weapon, instead of something everybody else is already using. I mean, how often are people honestly impressed with Thunderfury and Warglaives anymore? It's no longer 'the cool thing' to throw them on for screenshots, and when people do, you tend to see ridicule for it.<br />
<br />
Not saying I ridicule them necessarily, but that's just what the trends seem to be.</div></div><hr />

as warlock yeah.<br />
attack the warrior with the ruthless gear and 150k hp buffed or the warrior in green and blue questgear with 100k hp.<br />

<br />
really depends on the class you play. For some classes another class in shitty gear can kill you because of their class mechanics.<br />
as warlock i often end up under 50% hp bcs some rogue or dk in shitty gear tries to kill me. While they fail due their bad gear, they can get me low enough to let any decent geared and skilled person to kill me.<br />
if i play on my dk ( blood in bg ) i dont gife a crap about a shitty geared person hitting me because it just feels like they tickling me.</div></div><hr />

I suspect blizz will do it like EQ2 did.<br />
Have a tab under options called &quot;Models&quot; which let you chose old or new for each race/gender</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you consider half tiers and the various levels of pvp sets. DKs have a very large assortment of sets to choose from. All other classes have a few more, but overall, all classes have lots of tier and pvp sets out there.</div></div><hr />

I agree it's unlikely but they could probably use another gold sink right about now so offering a paid service for a large amount of in game currency could be a good option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just look like the enchanting/reforge npcs in Stormwind. Trader, Trainer and Reforger npcs. Same house model and same npcs position.</div></div><hr />

Real Life Cash VS In-Game Gold Sink.<br />
<br />
From a business standpoint, I'd pick the RL cash.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syah</div><div class="date">2011-08-11, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I admit that I am at a loss for what a Transmogrifier will end up being in WoW terms, I am certain that it will NOT be a way to re-texture our armor.<br />
<br />
There are two levels of gear status symbolism in WoW, models and textures. A new model lets you indicate to others that you are up to date with the current content (both PvP and PvE). Textures are Blizzard's way of letting you show off your raiding or PvP prowress. <br />
<br />
There is an entire set of PvP gear each season available at high ratings in 3v3/5v5/RBGs that has no stat difference from the conquest gear available to everyone. It even uses the same model. The only difference is the texture applied to the model. <br />
<br />
If we were allowed to re-color/re-texture our armor, Blizzard would need to then compensate by creating four sets of models each tier (2 each for pvp and pve) rather than simply using different textures to differentiate between normal/heroic raiding or regular/elite pvp.<br />
<br />
I think it would be great if they did that, but I really doubt it will happen.</div></div><hr />

But why? Why not just make it a simple options toggle? If blizz did it and charged 1,000G to use then most people would cry foul. If it cost 1G, people would question why it had to be a vendor in the first place.</div></div><hr />
