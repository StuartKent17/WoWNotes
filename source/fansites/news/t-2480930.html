<br />
Tickets to this year’s show go on sale May 4 at 10 a.m. PDT and May 8 at 7 p.m. PDT through AXS (http://www.axs.com/blizzcon)—check out the BlizzCon Event Info pages for all the details, and read on to learn about what’s in store.<br />

<br />
Whether you’re exploring Azeroth with your closest friends, pushing the payload with trusted allies, or engaging in a friendly duel at the Tavern, your favorite games can feel like a home away from home. For a handful of days every year, the bonds people forge online manifest IRL at BlizzCon, as people from all walks of life converge in Anaheim to celebrate a shared love of games.<br />
<br />
This year, we have some exciting updates designed to make the BlizzCon experience even more epic and memorable for everyone joining us—including a broader range of ticketing options and some new activities for attendees to rally around.<br />
<br />
An Epic Welcome<br />
We’re kicking things off a day earlier this year with what we’re calling the BlizzCon Pregame Festivities, a “Welcome to BlizzCon” get-together in the plaza outside the convention center on Thursday, October 31, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PDT. This casual gathering will give everyone a place to meet up and hang out with friends, enjoy food and drinks, and do a /readycheck before the main event begins Friday morning.<br />
<br />
We’re also making room for more indoor activities this year by expanding the show into Hall E on Friday and Saturday. If you’ve been to BlizzCon before, that’s usually where registration and the BlizzCon Store resides—this year, the store’s heading to the North Hall, registration is moving off-site (nearby), and we’re recapturing the Hall E area to make room for some BlizzCon fun. We’ve got some playful plans in the works for that space, so stay tuned for more information.<br />
<br />
And as always, BlizzCon 2019 will feature everything you’ve come to expect from the convention—the epic opening ceremony, developer panels across multiple stages, the Community Night contests, hands-on demos, world-class esports competition, and much more!<br />
<br />
A Trio of BlizzCon Options<br />
As BlizzCon has expanded and evolved, we’ve heard from guests and attendees that they’d be interested in more options and conveniences for navigating the show and exploring at a different pace. With that in mind, we’re adding a new ticket—the BlizzCon Portal Pass—available in limited quantities in addition to the BlizzCon Pass and Benefit Dinner options. Here’s a breakdown of all three:<br />
<br />
BlizzCon Pass (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/tickets/convention) – This is the core BlizzCon ticket you know and love, and what most BlizzCon attendees will want to go for. The BlizzCon Pass provides the same full general-admission access as in previous years, along with access to Thursday’s BlizzCon Pregame Festivities. You’ll also get the BlizzCon in-game goodies (to be announced), along with your choice of this year’s BlizzCon Commemorative Collectible, which you can read more about below. Learn more about the BlizzCon Pass (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/tickets/convention).<br />
<br />
BlizzCon Portal Pass (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/tickets/convention-2) – New for 2019! – The BlizzCon Portal Pass is your gateway to an array of extras, including access to the Darkmoon Faire area on the eve of BlizzCon for a special “Night at the Faire.” It also comes with convienct perks such as preferred parking, separate registration and security lines, an option to be among the first to enter the show on Friday and Saturday, a dedicated lounge for taking a load off during BlizzCon, and more. Learn more about the BlizzCon Portal Pass (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/tickets/convention-2).<br />
<br />
BlizzCon Benefit Dinner (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/tickets/benefit) – Returning for 2019, the BlizzCon Benefit Dinner gives you a chance to meet and chat with developers, artists, and other folks from Blizzard the night before the show at a laid-back charity dinner—all for an exceptional cause. Your BlizzCon Benefit Dinner purchase also comes with entry to BlizzCon and all of the BlizzCon Portal Pass perks. As in past years, the net proceeds from the BlizzCon Benefit Dinner go to benefit CHOC Children’s (http://www.choc.org/), whose mission is to nurture, advance, and protect the health and well-being of children. Learn more about the BlizzCon Benefit Dinner (http://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/tickets/benefit).<br />
<br />
And of course, for those who can’t make it to Anaheim in person, there will be ways to watch BlizzCon online, as well as get this year’s commemorative in-game goodies. We’ll share more information on our plans for experiencing BlizzCon at home in the future, so stay tuned.<br />
<br />
How to Get Tickets - New for 2019!<br />
This year, we’re teaming up with online ticketing vendor AXS to sell tickets to BlizzCon 2019. Tickets will be sold in two batches, with quantities of all three ticket types available on both dates:<br />
<br />
BlizzCon Ticket Sale #1: Saturday, May 4 – 10 a.m. PDT<br />
BlizzCon Ticket Sale #2: Wednesday, May 8 – 7 p.m. PDT<br />
<br />
Online waiting room opens approximately 30 minutes before on-sale time<br />
<br />
<br />
Get Tickets May 4 and May 8 (http://www.axs.com/blizzcon)<br />
<br />
AXS provides tickets for a wide variety of major events, and they’re the ticket provider for our own esports events at the Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles. If you’ve bought BlizzCon tickets in the past, AXS’s system works a bit differently from those in previous years. To learn more about the key changes and get yourself ready, check out our 5 Things You Need to Know About Buying BlizzCon 2019 Tickets blog (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/news/22938865).<br />
<br />
If you want to set up an AXS account in advance and save yourself a step during the ticket-buying process, you can head to the BlizzCon AXS account registration page (http://www.axs.com/blizzcon_signup). Alternatively, you’ll have the option to log in using your Blizzard account during ticket sales, if you’d prefer.<br />
<br />
Either way, note that once you’ve purchased tickets, they will be digitally delivered to you prior to the show via the AXS app, which you’ll be prompted to download to your mobile device at your convenience following the ticket-purchase process.<br />
<br />
BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible – Celebrating 25 Years of Warcraft®<br />
BlizzCon 2019 just so happens to coincide with a very special anniversary. This year, we’re celebrating 25 years of the Warcraft universe, and to mark the occasion we’re giving away something uniquely Azerothian to BlizzCon attendees.<br />
<br />
In place of the usual BlizzCon Goody Bag we’ve given out in the past, this year’s BlizzCon-goers will receive their choice of a special, premium BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/news/22955737)—either an Orc Grunt statue or Human Footman statue—representing a quarter century of conflict and camaraderie, but mostly conflict.<br />
<br />
We’ll be producing quantities based on what people choose—so to accommodate production deadlines and have everyone’s statue ready in time for pickup at BlizzCon, you’ll need to decide which statue you want at the time you purchase your tickets. For those who might want to own both, the statues will be available for purchase separately during a limited pre-order window starting May 4, the same day as the first ticket sale.<br />
<br />
Check out our BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible preview (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/news/22955737) to get a closer look and learn more about making your selection.<br />
<br />
This year’s BlizzCon is shaping up to be an epic one. Whether you hail from Taipei, Tristram, Kansas, or King’s Row, we can’t wait to welcome you back home!<br />
<br />
<br />
BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible Celebrates 25 Years of Warcraft<br />
November 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of the Warcraft® universe, and instead of doing a typical BlizzCon® Goody Bag as we have in past years, we’d like to commemorate the occasion by providing BlizzCon attendees a distinctly Azerothian memento.<br />
<br />
We’re excited to announce that everyone who buys a ticket to attend this year’s BlizzCon will receive their choice of a special BlizzCon 2019 Commemorative Collectible—one of two premium statues in the style of the Blizzard Legends series, celebrating a quarter century of Warcraft’s timeless central conflict. Take up arms alongside the mighty Orc Grunt, or side with the bold Human Footman!<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT! You’ll need to decide which statue you want at the time you purchase your tickets on May 4 or May 8. We’ll be producing quantities for pickup at BlizzCon based on what people choose, and locking in your selection now helps us ensure we’ll have everyone’s statue ready in time for the show!<br />
<br />

<br />
Zug zug! Mark the 25th anniversary of Warcraft with this mighty axe-wielding Orc Grunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/thumb/bcon02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/bcon02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Ready for action! Honor the legends of Azeroth with the fierce and noble Human Footman.<br />
<br />
Since statue choices are locked in at the time of ticket purchase, make sure to sync up with family and friends in advance to determine which one everyone wants. BlizzCon attendees will pick up their preselected statues with their badges at the show—and keep in mind that if you choose to transfer tickets (find out more), the selected statue will stay connected to that ticket.<br />
<br />
In addition, anyone who wants either statue (or both!) will be able to purchase the Orc Grunt and Human Footman for a limited time on the Blizzard Gear Store starting May 4. Statues purchased during this window will be shipped directly to your home around the time of BlizzCon. Stay tuned for more details.<br />
<br />
Here’s to 25 years of Warcraft—we’re looking forward to celebrating with you at BlizzCon!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like how they think their convention is worth $230 after last year and the continual decline in quality/players across their games.<br />
<br />
I also like how they had a record year of profits, say they do Blizzcon &quot;for the fans and operate at a loss&quot; and yet still go cash grabby as hell on it. And introduce a new 500 dollar pass which really isn't worth $270 more than a regular ticket lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean yeah they easily have people willing to throw money away at them I guess? The fact they keep increasing it and finding new ways to cash grab with yet another ticket that isn't worth 500 dollars despite the fact this is an event &quot;for the fans&quot; shows that they really care about operating at a loss. Especially after Activision told them to make more money.<br />
<br />
30,000 is it? While they've had a huge drop of players across all games and whatnot I doubt it's as low as 30k.</div></div><hr />

Nah it'll fill out.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has people who willingly throw money at whatever they do. Why do you think WoW has a record quarter when it's been shoving MTX on the store like mad?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean feel free to tell yourself that.<br />
<br />
But 30,000 people to the 5-6 million users who left Blizzard games as a whole (mostly WoW). I think it's safe to say where the majority lies.</div></div><hr />

With proper paint job, the statues would look dope AF tbh. Even a simple coat of wash/glaze after the basic paint was done would make it look so much better...<br />
<br />
Reactions on everything blizzard are kinda getting stale though. Haters gonna hate, whales gonna whale...<br />

<br />
I also like how they had a record year of profits, say they do Blizzcon &quot;for the fans and operate at a loss&quot; and yet still go cash grabby as hell on it. And introduce a new 500 dollar pass which really isn't worth $270 more than a regular ticket lol.<br />
<br />
or you know, maybe the decline isn't nearly as bad as your feelcraft think it is, ever considered that ?<br />

We KNOW 8.3 is the last patch, 8.2 is scheduled from around end june early july, there's no way they don't announce at blizzcon, any later and it'll be another long drought and that'll hurt them worse then &quot;rushing&quot;</div></div><hr />

Aside from TBC having been a few weeks late, every WoW expansion has been released in an even-numbered year and announced in an odd-numbered year. A new expansion being revealed sometime this year would be expected, regardless of its quality.</div></div><hr />

$30 price hike per ticket is pretty minor with inflation, especially considering what most people spend to attend already. Flights, hotel rooms, expensive venue food, merch, etc. Not to mention that a lot of attendees build a whole vacation around it, since the Anaheim Convention Center is right across from Disneyland.</div></div><hr />

We have 2 more raid tiers? 8.2 will hit around late june with the raid after the 4th of july. 8.3 Late November with the Raid early december or early jan.<br />
<br />
We already know 8.2 isn't the last patch and the 8.2 raid isn't the last raid. Not to mention that Classic will probably release in late Aug. to early or mid Sep. which will placate people for a month or so.</div></div><hr />

IMO it would make more sense to just piggyback on PAX East. A big part of the reason they can go all out for Blizzcon is the Anaheim Convention Center is pretty close to the Blizzard campus in Irvine.</div></div><hr />

I mean.. warcraft III was pretty cool. But the lines were so long I never got to try it.

FWIW, the playtest lines usually move really fast so I wouldn't be put off by how ridiculously long they sometimes look. I don't think I've waited more than 20 minutes in a very long time. Every other kind of line can fuck right off but the playtest ones go quickly.<br />
<br />
(as far as Diablo, they obviously grossly misunderstood their audience. I am not going to come at them for delving into mobile gaming -- that's likely a smart business decision for the gaming industry in general -- but if they thought the people at Blizzcon for Diablo would give any shits about it then they need to pay more attention to their community because that was a very bad misread.)</div></div><hr />

If you only care about the announcements you can watch them for free. People go to the convention to meet up and party.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beelgers</div><div class="date">2019-04-25, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">$30 price hike per ticket is pretty minor with inflation, especially considering what most people spend to attend already. Flights, hotel rooms, expensive venue food, merch, etc. Not to mention that a lot of attendees build a whole vacation around it, since the Anaheim Convention Center is right across from Disneyland.<br />
<br />
Exactly. I don't see what the fuss is over. A 16%/$31 increase isn't going to be a big factor in the decision on whether or not someone is going to go that really wants to. I'm sure people think it should be $5 or something. A LOT goes into it. Plus, it just doesn't make sense to not charge a lot for something that will sell out in seconds. You want Blizz to make smart business decisions to stay afloat while you believe they're bleeding subs? Well this is a no-brainer business decision. They should honestly charge a lot more. Still would sell out in seconds.</div></div><hr />

If nothing else, I feel like the morale of everyone there isn't going to allow the same level of enthusiasm.<br />

I guess the lottery will decide anyway if I can even go.<br />
My guess would be that it was always contracted 3rd party event planners. You aren't going to ask the people answering questions on forums to organize a multi-day convention for tens of thousands of people involving dozens of other companies and parties, as well as a built in filming and livestreaming service. You have someone who's entire career is based on doing that organize it. And you aren't going to pay someone full-time year round to organize one event that you decide whether or not to have on a yearly basis, so whoever does it is probably not a Blizzard employee, but a group hired by Blizzard specifically for the event.</div></div><hr />

The two are not the same. The sort of person who organizes competitive events like OWL is not the same person organizing a 40,000 person convention. OWL probably has it's own dedicated organization team to begin with.</div></div><hr />

The MAJORITY of the event is probably 3rd party. It is not like any of the other events Blizzard does, so it requires people who have expertise in that kind of large scale event planning, not people who organize team building trips, small competitive events, events for visting partner companies, etc.</div></div><hr />

Think you're right. Blizzcon is organised by Blizzard staff. There was a video about the person organising last year on the blizzcon site. I think they'd been the assistant organiser previously and 2018 was their first year as the lead.<br />
<br />
Also a lot of the support at the event was the customer service people they brought in which is why Blizzcon is held where it is. Easy access to blizzard staff.<br />
<br />
Just a pity all the 2018 content is gone now (or at least I can't find it) with the update to 2019 info.</div></div><hr />

<br /> 
The shift toward seasonal &quot;stuff&quot; isn't really any different then in the past honestly. There's always been catchup after the new tier starts, since at least TBC. And since around Wrath we started moving away from raids being relevant all expansion to only the current being relevant.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure they are just like the Greymane and... uhh.. whatever orc they did before. I have the Greymane one, and while I like it, it is plastic and I certainly wouldn't say it justifies the ticket price hike.<br />
<br />
Last year was the first time I didn't attend or buy the virtual ticket, and I doubt I will this year either. I don't have much hope for them turning WoW around, and I'm not that invested in any of their other games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also like how they had a record year of profits, say they do Blizzcon &quot;for the fans and operate at a loss&quot; and yet still go cash grabby as hell on it. And introduce a new 500 dollar pass which really isn't worth $270 more than a regular ticket lol.<br />
<br />
Here is a crazy idea, if you don't think it is worth it do not pay for it. Simple as that. Going on whining about how a corporation is so greedy for doing things for money does literally nothing but make you look incredibly naive. I have never paid for a ticket, digital or otherwise, because I have never seen the value in it. I get all the important news for free same day it's announced. <br />
<br />
But to address your comment of them thinking their convention is worth what they charge; it is, because people will pay it. If they didn't sell out or close to it I am sure it would be reduced.</div></div><hr />

In the past, they've certainly had third parties do a lot of the logistical and technical things, like the livestreaming and ticket sales and security and whatnot. However, a shitton of the actual events have been either organised or hosted or both by the community departments. Things like the Darkmoon Faire, on-site events and showcases (pin trading, signature wall, art display, etc), the cosplay contests and basically all of the &quot;Community Night,&quot; organising fansite interviews, handling the press room and playtest areas, as well as planning and arranging the particular panels for their respective games, etc. Basically, a ton of stuff that actually impacts the experience of the con-goer was done by people on the teams for those games themselves.<br />
<br />
Nearly all the community teams have been gutted, and those people are mostly gone. Those jobs are going to have to be picked up by other parties that maybe don't know and understand the community as well, but if nothing else, don't have the years of experience to build off of the way that dedicated employees did.

Shrug. Darkmoon faire didn't exist the year I went so I can't really comment on it, but isn't its whole thing being largely Dev based, not support staff? I think you are both exaggerating the impact of the layoffs and overvaluing &quot;dedicated employees&quot;. You do not need a dedicated CM to put up the signature wall or the art gallery, those aren't even the kinds of things they'd be doing. I don't recall the actual hosting of the costume or voice line contests ever being amazing, those are entirely on the fans. I don't think Blizzcon is going to be ruined because one awkward person introducing people for a contest is going to be replaced by a different awkward person introducing people for a contest. I've never been a collectable person, but watching video of the pin trading area, it likewise seems to be 99% attendees doing there thing.<br />
<br />
Panels are facilitated by CMs, but they aren't planned by them--like just on a basic logistic level. The devs are the ones who know what they want to talk about and reveal and are organizing their own information for what they feel should be talked about. Ythisens was cool, but let's be real here, it's not like he's sitting down Ion and going &quot;alright Ion, we're going to announce the next expansion, and here's the information we're going to tell them, and it would probably work best in this order and I think we'll save this bit of lore for later and the models for this part aren't quite done so maybe get video footage of this instead&quot;. Devs were sitting CMs down and going &quot;here is a bunch of information we need in a blog post to be posted during or just after the panel.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is going to be the same thing as ever. Not having those CMs hasn't hindered their interviews for 8.2, or them pulling in people to playtest it. Having those employees didn't make Blizzcon 2018 not super lackluster compared to 2017. So why would you think not having them is suddenly going to tank 2019?</div></div><hr />

Well YouTube is still filled with Blizzard shills ( T&amp;E, Hazel, etc ) and for a decent streamer on Twitch 230 USD is pocket cash so yeah tickets will sell out as usual.<br />

Overpriced tickets and a statue. Oh how quality has dropped after their fiasco last year when a meme was born from their idiocy and uncaring towards their fans. People are free to spend their money on these tickets and probably will but 229$ can be put towards something else. With the prices from regular price and Portal Pass ticket its just furthers bring into reality that we're nothing but payers to them not players as they once saw us.</div></div><hr />

Why should it be the last one? I dont get this reasoning. Is there any signs of this being the last one? Is Blizzard shutting down?<br />
<br />
Many reasons. Cost cutting and control from ATVI ( blizzcon could easily just become Activiscon) , The ATVI stock price being way down. The state of the Video hgame industry at the moment is shit for AAA companies. Blizzard being forced to Work on New games and produce them regularly to please Overlod Kotick. Blizzard is not printing money like they did in the old days. <br />
<br />
Another big reason is California itself. Cali is getting ridiculous to do business in any more. Its why so many Tech companies and fleeing the state and going to TExas<br />

Targeting Whales. It's really that simple. <br />
<br />
You alienate most of your normal fans and drive them away, so all you have left to do is target the people who are too uncaring or stupid to recognize they're being exploited.<br />
<br />
EDIT: INB4 some knight rolls through spamming about &quot;fans being able to enjoy what they want and who cares what you think&quot;: After last year's con and how Blizzard has shown an absolute and total disregard for their western customers in favor of the asia mobile market, you are throwing money away at the misguided hope that Blizzard is somehow magically going to stop being a sociopathic, money-grubbing corporation? I'm sorry, but that is STUPID. You can like to spend money on stupid things, but don't try to deny how stupid it is. Embrace your stupidity. Admit it. But don't try to defend it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the problem though. The &quot;general gaming public&quot; just isn't aware of what these game companies are doing, or how the business models work, or why they're being targeted with hype. They just want games, and they never think. Emphasis on the &quot;never think&quot; part. <br />
<br />
And I get it. It's comforting to sit in ignorance and enjoy the fun. But when you start throwing hundreds of dollars to go to a convention who's only purpose is to reinforce that ignorance....that's troubling. Especially when you've got a company like ActiBlizz who's engaging in some of the worst behavior a corporation can do. <br />
<br />
This isn't some mindless shreiking REEEEEEE moment because my class got nerfed. This is recognizing that Activision-Blizzard is not worth supporting, and pointing it out to people who probably don't know. The fact that anyone, like you, is trying to downplay that or rationalize it, is borderline unbelievable. <br />
<br />
Re-assessing your opinion and position based on new information is the hallmark of intelligence. You don't like what I'm saying because it paints Blizzard in a poor light. But I want you to give serious consideration that it's not me that's doing it. Blizzard did that to themselves. If Blizzard WASN'T being an absolute scumbag, I wouldn't be here posting about it. I'd probably be playing their games.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you this: Do you even know what I'm referring to when I say Blizzard is behaving in a way that players shouldn't be supporting?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thetruth1400</div><div class="date">2019-04-25, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact they are spitting on their legacy with Diablo Immortal is bad enough. Diablo, Warcraft and Starcraft were the brand names that made Blizzard who they are.<br />
<br />
There's the rub though; they're who they used to be in name only. Now, they are a publicly traded company with a parent company who wants one thing; results. They are taking that good will that they earned off the backs of their predecessors in the company and using it to get said results; in this case being, profit. <br />
<br />
As sad as it is, Blizzard is now a company that prioritizes money first, players second. Sure, they can say they still prioritize customers, but I feel like people haven't felt that in a long while. Also, with them moving towards a market (mobile gaming) that their core players (the players who made them the company they are) are being tosses to the wayside in favor of turn over customers and whales, and all of that is thanks to their parent company and public trading.<br />
<br />
If they were a private company, they wouldn't have to answer to stock holders and their boards, and might focus on long term health of their games, not quick flips to generate money.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tziva</div><div class="date">2019-04-25, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is going to be the same thing as ever. Not having those CMs hasn't hindered their interviews for 8.2, or them pulling in people to playtest it. Having those employees didn't make Blizzcon 2018 not super lackluster compared to 2017. So why would you think not having them is suddenly going to tank 2019?<br />
I can't speak to whether it hindered their 8.2 interviews to be honest, as I've not done anything as press since before the layoffs, but anecdotally as an outsider, it definitely seems like they are relying more heavily on public streams than 1v1 press interviews. They've done one press summit for WoW I know since then, but not sure about the other games. That said, arranging and wrangling the press experience and coordinating interviews for dozens and dozens of press for Blizzcon is a whole lot different than setting up some Skype calls about a patch with a few major fansites.<br />
<br />
But to be clear, I didn't say anything about &quot;tanking&quot; the convention. I expressed skepticism that those things would be done as well or with the same experience and enthusiasm, and I also expressed conflicted emotions about it given the way the layoffs and other decisions had been handled recently. I think the community team members were very valuable to both the player and con-goer experience --moreso than most people realise -- and their loss will have an impact for us.<br />
<br />
<br />
isn't its whole thing being largely Dev based, not support staff?<br />
Devs do the talks and provide the information, but afaik they don't handle any of the planning of the actual events. They're probably too busy doing actual dev things.<br />
<br />
<br />
You do not need a dedicated CM to put up the signature wall or the art gallery, those aren't even the kinds of things they'd be doing. I don't recall the actual hosting of the costume or voice line contests ever being amazing, those are entirely on the fans. I don't think Blizzcon is going to be ruined because one awkward person introducing people for a contest is going to be replaced by a different awkward person introducing people for a contest. I've never been a collectable person, but watching video of the pin trading area, it likewise seems to be 99% attendees doing there thing.<br />
As far as the rest, it seems like we're mostly talking about different things. You're talking about information or participation, I'm talking about the actual planning and coordinating. Using the Community Night, for example, the role of the CM wasn't to be the awkward person introducing the contest. They were the people that coordinated the whole thing, reviewing and handling the applications and selecting the participants, connecting with those cosplayers, arranging the backend stuff for the contest like prejudging and photoops, arranging the judges and hosting, etc; basically planning the night. They did this for all the community night contests and features. Similarly for art wall or pin trading, I don't mean they are standing there facilitating the process, I mean they are the ones that come up with these ideas, plan them, and implement them on the show floor. Those were just a few of the examples I tossed out but they do a lot of things along those lines: organising, coordinating, and facilitating interactions between the community and the devs/company, including organising and implementing many of the community events and features at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
My point is that the community people have historically been responsible to various degrees-- some of them significant -- for the attendee experience at the convention. Those jobs being shifted elsewhere is something I feel will probably have a negative impact. You can't outsource everything or move things to unpaid employees or less experienced people or departments without there being any repercussions. Maybe the difference will be minimal and only noticed by a few, maybe it will be huge. I don't know, but I think it's a valid concern.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, this should be pretty much the primary reason anyone goes to Blizzcon (except maybe playtest demos) because as many have pointed out, you can get all the information online almost as quickly as you get it from Blizzcon. Going to the convention in person is really about the experience, connecting with guild and teammates, and other fans. Part of the reason I like going is to see people I only get to see like once a year.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of reasons to express disappointment with Blizzard lately, but I don't think the ticket price is really one of them. It's not out of line for other major conventions in the US. E3, Twitchcon, PAX, CES, and ComicCon are all similar prices for a full pass (although obviously differing lengths and some allow you to save cost by buying per-day). It's on the higher end of the spectrum to be sure, but not so much that it seems wildly inappropriate. They haven't raised prices in a few years so it's probably due for one anyway just for inflationy reasons. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of money and you have to be pretty invested in the games and/or community for it to be worth it -- especially if you have travel costs -- but it's definitely not a pantsonheadcrazy price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes there is few very vocal people on forums who dont like it but silent majority who dont spend half of life on forums enjoy both mobile games and microtransactions. <br />
<br />
every developer atm is releasing mobile games with MTx<br />
<br />
you know why ? because people have shitload of money with nothing to spend them on.<br />
<br />
i get it - there are poor people here or people from poor countries but there are milions out there who make &gt;3k $/euro per month and dont care if they spend 100-200 monthly on games.<br />

thats why whole gaming market is moving into this direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes there is few very vocal people on forums who dont like it but silent majority who dont spend half of life on forums enjoy both mobile games and microtransactions. <br />
<br />
every developer atm is releasing mobile games with MTx<br />
<br />
you know why ? because people have shitload of money with nothing to spend them on.<br />
<br />
i get it - there are poor people here or people from poor countries but there are milions out there who make &gt;3k $/euro per month and dont care if they spend 100-200 monthly on games.<br />
<br />
thats why whole gaming market is moving into this direction.<br />
<br />
Over-using MTX or prefering mobile over PC is secondary. I'm talking about ActiBlizz committing tax evasion while giving their CFO massive bonuses at the same time as laying off 800 employees during a year of record profits! <br />
<br />
Does this sound like the type of company that you want to celebrate? That you want to pay MORE money to after last year being told that they don't give a shit about you because they're going to china?<br />
<br />
Do you think a company willing to do those things is going to be good or benevolent towards its players? Do you think they're going to be fair, or have your best interests at heart? <br />

Where is the overuse of micro transactions? So far, there has been more added in game than anything in the shop, and even if that wasn’t true there’s the fact that everything in the cash shop is cosmetic and optional. There’s no reason to buy any of it except the f you want to.<br />
Tax evasion? Jesus, did you even read the article? So far, nothing illegal has happened. What they did is no different than the equivalency of people itemizing their taxes or claiming their cell phone for work use as a write off. Just because a big company knows how to save money thru smart tax practices does not mean anything illegal is happening.<br />
Oh wow, higher ups getting more money after a profit year, what company ever does that? <br />
Yeah, they terminated employees. Considering most of them were in sectors that are being made obsolete with future technology, such as customer service and handling in game tickets, why should a company keep people on as it simply loses them money? Is it horrible that people lose their job? Yes, but why do you not rage out over Walmart terminating employees while installing self checkouts? Or any company that laid off employees in favor of automated systems?<br />
Who said Blizz is going to China? Do you have insider information? They made a mobile game as a business venture that will increase profits. For fucking shame! I’m not going to defend how they handled the situation as I agree Blizzcon could have been handled better; however, now that the dust has settled most people have taken the position they wouldn’t have cared about a mobile announcement if Blizz had announced Diablo 4 with it. Most people don’t come off as outraged about a mobile game being made except the way it was announced.<br />
Bottom line is I do enjoy their games. Maybe that’s because I can accept that life happens and companies pay people off, even while making money. Maybe I can accept that a company tries to make extra money while putting cosmetic, not necessary, items on a cash shop that I don’t have to buy. I still enjoy playing with multiple people and progressing in raids. Eventually the game won’t be fun for me and I will quit. Or maybe some day WoW will become P2W and I will quit then. That has not happened, so I will keep playing.</div></div><hr />

Now, they are a publicly traded company with a parent company who wants one thing; results. They are taking that good will that they earned off the backs of their predecessors in the company and using it to get said results; in this case being, profit. <br />
<br />
As sad as it is, Blizzard is now a company that prioritizes money first, players second. Sure, they can say they still prioritize customers, but I feel like people haven't felt that in a long while. Also, with them moving towards a market (mobile gaming) that their core players (the players who made them the company they are) are being tosses to the wayside in favor of turn over customers and whales, and all of that is thanks to their parent company and public trading.<br />
<br />
If they were a private company, they wouldn't have to answer to stock holders and their boards, and might focus on long term health of their games, not quick flips to generate money.<br />
<br />
They've literally never been a private company, not under the name &quot;Blizzard Entertainment&quot;, because they changed to that name the first time they got acquired, and they've just been bounced around to different owners since then.</div></div><hr />

However this was during legion and the price was 190$ or so iirc. Raising the price again by this much is really off-putting. I’d love to attend blizzcon and I’d do it specifically for WoW but I can’t really justify spending that just to go see WoW shit when all of it will be revealed on this website or wowhead/Twitter. When I went during legion it was mainly just socializing and drinking which was also awesome but I already do that in college for 200$ less than these tickets. Doesn’t seem worth it to me especially after last year. <br />
<br />
However I’m still hyped regardless for WoW stuff. Always will be even if I’m not playing in the future. Just can’t justify spending 230+ to socialize and party when I do that for free/cheap at college. Everyone at blizzcon is usually super awesome though so if you do wanna go for the social aspect its well worth it imo. If blizzcon is still around later in my life I’d probably go again.<br />
<br />
Honestly if you live close and just want to party, I'm sure you could just show up and not go to the convention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At what point does the excuse of &quot;Well I just enjoy their games&quot; stop holding up?<br />
<br />
What &quot;tax-evasion&quot; did ActiBlizz commit? Last I saw they weren't under audit by the IRS (but I could be wrong, if so please correct me). If this is a complaint that they didn't pay taxes but there's no legal reason they should've paid taxes then this complaint should be levied against Congress and the President to pass effective taxation which is another subject entirely. <br />
<br />
ActiBlizz (nor any company) is required to pay taxes out of the goodness of their hearts. They're required to pay the legally required taxation and if you think that is insufficient, then we need to work towards passing effective taxation. In my personal opinion, we do need to pass effective taxation, but that's not solely an ActiBlizz problem and to single them out is unfair.<br />
<br />
Record profits and layoffs don't go as hand in hand as you think. Adjusting what they think employee needs are (which means possibly automating more jobs to reduce the amount of manual work) results in layoffs, but if that money is redirected to more developers and more development projects, that's not necessarily a bad thing. <br />
<br />
To blanket claim that record profits means there shouldn't be layoffs means you don't understand how revenue can ebb and flow. A better example of this is car companies, for ex: GM in 1979 (record profits) then GM in 1980s (record losses) so one good year doesn't mean you don't adjust for the future.<br />
<br />
In addition, in their memo to stockholders, they did clearly stress about how they were redirecting the money from support roles to developers so it's not like it's strictly cost cutting.<br />
<br />
Of all the things I was actually disappointed by, I was disappointed by them throwing in the towel on HotS esports. I think that could've continued to be grown and matured and it would've also had tie ins with OWL.<br />
<br />
I understand your frustration with their corporate policy, but I don't want to oversimplify the issue of record profits = no layoffs ever. In addition, paying no taxes = bad company. A company legally taking advantage of the tax system isn't a company problem; it's a systemic problem.</div></div><hr />

should be the same size as the heroe's line or whatever it's called that came out last year at con, and those are nice for the price. They are designed for statue collectors that can't or don't want to pay 300+ for the larger scale ones. <br />

<br />
When the practices you spout are plain wrong, as also pointed out by someone after me in a response to your exact same post, then yes.<br />
I even agreed that Blizzcon last year was handled poorly with the mobile announcement, but still added that after the rage has died down most people in forums you read from even stated they wouldn’t have cared at all about a mobile game announcement if it had been tied in with a D4 announcement.<br />
So yes, I will defend a company whose games I still enjoy from people who spout off wrong information as if it is fact. If you bring up something worth merit I would probably agree with you; however, your point of tax evasion is false. Your issue with the layoffs, while it sucks people lose their jobs, is a fact of life for any major company that starts embracing the future of autonomous systems, as even demonstrated by companies like Walmart and even smaller grocery/department stores that use self checkouts, as well as many customer service phone services. Maybe come back with genuine information that has facts behind it and you will have a genuine complaint.</div></div><hr />

It's actually disgusting they have the gall to do this after Blizzcon 2018. Not only upping the price but charging for a 3rd ticket that barely offers anything.<br />
<br />
But of course despite the fact they &quot;do this for the fans at a loss&quot; gotta rake in that money after a record year and firing employees amirite?<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, they are wrong. Legal loophole or not (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFKnv1YzI3k), the practice of a multi-million dollar corporation paying zero tax...paying less tax than a minimum wage worker in america...is WRONG. <br />
<br />
The practice of laying off the experienced, higher-paid employees that helped make you that record profit, then re-posting their same positions to hire in entry-level employees to do the same job for less money is WRONG. Don't believe me? Why don't you actually look into what they're doing instead of making up strawman reasons for the layoffs. Go check Bellular's video starting at 9:33. (https://youtu.be/pFDf-ARqtrI?t=574) <br />
<br />
Acti-blizz has shown that they don't care about their customers' wants or desires beyond how to manipulate the most money out of them, and they've shown that they don't care about even their own employees. These are not the actions of a company that should be supported, and if you want to perform mental gymnastics to avoid having to face that because you &quot;enjoy their games&quot;, then at least own that bullshit. <br />
<br />
Look, I get it. Im asking a lot here. Im asking you to consider the idea that a game you really enjoy supports a company that you've probably trusted for over a decade. I'm asking the near-impossible: To change your opinion. <br />
<br />
You can come up with all kinds of rationalizations and hand-waving to ignore how Blizzard is behaving. You can dodge damning reports of their shitty behavior like Neo on a cocktail of Ritalin and Jolt Cola. You can think of me as some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist spouting nonsense. I can't stop you. But at some point that bird is going to come home to roost and you're going to get burned. At some point the shit will pile up to where not even you can't ignore it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're surprised people are? <br />
<br />
I'm always going to be surprised by this because I always assume people have enough sense and common decency to recognize when a corporation is taking a giant shit on them and trying to sell it as the next wonderful thing. And people wonder why I'm salty when I find out they don't have sense and they aren't decent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
possible reasons for a 500 VIP ticket: letting those that have that level of disposable income do so to try keep GA as low as possible, just rip more money from fans with more money.<br />
<br />
i can't say all the reasons but it doesn't HAVE to be evil or malicious intent..... I wouldn't be surprised at all if the 500 dollar ticket is to help offset the GA ones though. As well as AXS charging more than unvierse (i'm going off the thought these ticketing services charge to be used)<br />

Legal loophole or not (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFKnv1YzI3k), the practice of a multi-million dollar corporation paying zero tax...paying less tax than a minimum wage worker in america...is WRONG. <br />
<br />
The practice of laying off the experienced, higher-paid employees that helped make you that record profit, then re-posting their same positions to hire in entry-level employees to do the same job for less money is WRONG. Don't believe me? Why don't you actually look into what they're doing instead of making up strawman reasons for the layoffs. Go check Bellular's video starting at 9:33. (https://youtu.be/pFDf-ARqtrI?t=574) <br />
<br />
Acti-blizz has shown that they don't care about their customers' wants or desires beyond how to manipulate the most money out of them, and they've shown that they don't care about even their own employees. These are not the actions of a company that should be supported, and if you want to perform mental gymnastics to avoid having to face that because you &quot;enjoy their games&quot;, then at least own that bullshit. <br />
<br />
Look, I get it. Im asking a lot here. Im asking you to consider the idea that a game you really enjoy supports a company that you've probably trusted for over a decade. I'm asking the near-impossible: To change your opinion. <br />
<br />
You can come up with all kinds of rationalizations and hand-waving to ignore how Blizzard is behaving. You can dodge damning reports of their shitty behavior like Neo on a cocktail of Ritalin and Jolt Cola. You can think of me as some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist spouting nonsense. I can't stop you. But at some point that bird is going to come home to roost and you're going to get burned. At some point the shit will pile up to where not even you can't ignore it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm always going to be surprised by this because I always assume people have enough sense and common decency to recognize when a corporation is taking a giant shit on them and trying to sell it as the next wonderful thing. And people wonder why I'm salty when I find out they don't have sense and they aren't decent.<br />
<br />
As I replied to you earlier. It's unfair for you to single out ActiBlizz for the tax loophole while ignoring all the other companies that do it. It's a systemic problem that requires a systemic solution. ActiBlizz is hardly alone to blame in using it.<br />

<br />
Again, this isn't wrong either. There's no union for game development so they didn't do anything illegal. This actually does require the workers banding together to disallow this practice.<br />

It's actually disgusting they have the gall to do this after Blizzcon 2018. Not only upping the price but charging for a 3rd ticket that barely offers anything.<br />
<br />
But of course despite the fact they &quot;do this for the fans at a loss&quot; gotta rake in that money after a record year and firing employees amirite?<br />
<br />
Honestly dude it's just Activision sticking their nose in and telling them to make more profit across the board at the cost of quality and reputation.<br />

900 people on the poll has been to blizzcon MULTIPLE times? weird...<br />

How come? I live in Europe and attended since 2010. It's not like it's expensive if you have an education and a job. Plus the BlizzCon is always a bonus on your California vacation. Most people spend easily 200 bucks on an alchohol in one month.</div></div><hr />

After last year... would be surprised if it got sold out that fast.

And thanks to BFA im no longer playing ANY Blizzard game at the moment... i dont know if its a matter to be happy or cry about. Oh and they have nothing to announce... maybe Patch 8.4/5 for WoW or even play their fake D4 trailer to make people excited and then in 2020 announcing it beeing cancled while at the same time it wasnt even in development.</div></div><hr />

Mental gymnastics and attempts to redirect. I single out ActiBlizz because that's the scope of the discussion. Do you really want to expamd this to all the wrongdoings of the world?

You’re the one leaping thru mental gymnastics to try and get people to drop the arguement. As stated, your posts are flat wrong and false and show you either (A) have no idea how companies work in the world, or (B) you do know but would rather focus everything at ActiBlizz while giving everyone else a free pass.<br />
No body has brought up those other companies other than to give you examples and proof that your fighting a losing stand.<br />
Oh, and yes, a company does rehire for the same position. It’s actually not uncommon for one team to finish a project to be let go and then have other designers and code writers come in for less pay on the follow up project, keeping only the leads around. Also, that video said “some of the positions,” meaning not every position is being rehired like you’re trying to insinuate.</div></div><hr />

Oh FFS....<br />
<br />
The situation is bad across the entire AAA industry. Does the fact that Epic makes its employees work 100 hour weeks justify the tax evasion of Blizzard? Does the fact that EA underfunds and withholds resources to projects like Anthem, only to break up their sudio and lay off its employees when it doesn't perform to the unrealistic expectations? <br />
<br />
You keep trying to bring in the wrongdoings of other companies as though that's somehow going to justify what Blizzard is doing &quot;because that's just how things are&quot;, or t &quot;that's just how the industry is&quot; as though that somehow makes it right. Not only is it a bad argument, but is an intellectually dishonest one. <br />
<br />
I'm not giving other companies a pass, I'm staying focused on the topic so as not to get the discussion derailed in EXACTLY the way you're attempting! If you want to start different threads about other companies, by all means get to it. I'll challenge you there. But THIS discussion is about Activision-Blizzard and how their convention doesn't deserve attendance because of their actions. <br />
<br />
Stay on topic.<br />

As I said to Eapoe, yes you absolutely can hold individual companies responsible. The fact that other companies are performing the same reprehensible actions doesn't magically absolve Blizzard of wrongdoing. <br />
<br />
Likewise, the fact that Blizzard technically not braking any laws doesn't mean it's a practice we want to support by giving Blizzard more money.</div></div><hr />

No, it isn't mental gymnastics. Companies operate within the law and that's what matters.<br />
<br />
If a company pays 0 tax because it isn't obligated to pay any tax? That's legal. You can complain that that's wrong all you want, but singling out any individual company isn't fair because it's a systemic issue that needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />

I can't fault a company for legal behavior. I fault the system. Blaming one company instead of all the companies partaking in the problem doesn't help in my opinion but to each their own.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't expect any company to act ethically. Especially when most companies are chasing short term gains. I expect all companies to act legally (pay their legally required taxes, etc) but I don't think ethics are ever a factor anymore. <br />
<br />
I also didn't say I was going to Blizzcon, but honestly, raising the ticket prices from 200 to 230 is one of the least costs of actually going to Blizzcon. It's so infinitesimal it's hardly worth complaining about. The fluctuation of hotel, travel, and dining prices are usually much, much more dramatic than a 15% increase.<br />
<br />
In addition, I'd argue that since the tickets always sell out that the tickets are underpriced, but if it was up to me, I'd do some kind of auction for the tickets. Something like a sealed bid second price auction, truth be told.</div></div><hr />

Since when was murder ever legal?<br />
<br />
And no, you can't. Because the moment you say to company X you can't do this because of ethics, it puts them at a competitive disadvantage compared to every other company.<br />
<br />
Again, we should focus our energy on why is any company allowed to do this not why is ActiBlizz doing this.<br />
<br />
Also, no one is ethically required to pay taxes. You're required to pay the bare minimum tax. That's what everyone should pay. I agree that the tax minimization strategy that a lot of large companies should be closed but that's no reason to be upset at ActiBlizz for playing the same game as everyone else.<br />
<br />
You should probably get more involved with ITEP and Patriotic Millionaires to stop these practices. Here's an example of why we have to address it at the legal level. Granted, this is for a higher minimum wage, but the principle remains the same: https://patrioticmillionaires.org/2018/08/17/stop-requiring-me-to-subsidize-bad-business-practices/<br />

For the fourth time, I don't believe the tax evasion policy is that type of behavior. I believe it's a systemic problem and needs to be addressed systematically.<br />
<br />
My entire point is not that you need to focus on addressing what ActiBlizz does or what EA does or whatever. You have to work with organizations like ITEP to fix the tax law specifically.<br />
<br />
I don't feel like the taxation issue is bad or good behavior because I don't believe the tax legislation allows for bad or good behavior. I don't know how else I can state this.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I do believe there is a way to fix it and I do believe it should be fixed (but not under the guise of trying to force companies to behave more ethically since ethics don't exist with tax legislation) by writing effective tax legislation.</div></div><hr />

Do you define a shill as anyone who still enjoys the game and current systems, even if some people don't like them? I don't know if you can throw everyone into that category just because you don't enjoy the game or how its being developed anymore.</div></div><hr />

It's linked to the wow accounts, but the spyware seems questionable. Wondering if theres gonna be any ticket cancellations .</div></div><hr />

Bloody heck.....THOSE PRICES! Do people actually pay up to $1000? How is the dinner? I honestly hope it is Michelin star quality! Though even I have paid SOOO MUCH less at Michelin Star Quality Restaurant! Approx £200-£300 for a full course dinner and dessert.<br />
<br />
It's nothing to do with the dinner, it's all the other benefits. Plus it is a charity dinner which helps a children's hospital.<br />

They've done the charity dinner every year. I went once. I would guesstimate it makes around $50-100k? Nothing crazy but still nice.</div></div><hr />
