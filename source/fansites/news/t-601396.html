I proceeded to run a scan and found there indeed WAS a trojan in this patch. Run a virus scanner IMEDIATELY if you have downloaded this patch! I am NOT kidding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi all,<br />
<br />
We're investigating this at the moment. It seems some anti-virus programs were updated last night with new definitions, and they're now identifying the Background Downloader and some patch files as a trojan. We're trying to examine this further here and we'll let you know as we have any information.<br />
