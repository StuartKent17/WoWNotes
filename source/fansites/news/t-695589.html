Blue post - Cataclysm Goals<br />
I think some of you are misinterpreting a couple of the Cataclysm goals.<br />
<br />
We're not &quot;overhauling the combat system.&quot; We are changing some lame stats to be more interesting (like Intellect) and removing some that just added complexity to the game without adding depth (like armor pen, which is pretty much just damage modified by how much physical damage you do). We are adding more health across the board, but that's to add a few seconds in between the time you take damage and the time you die, which we think will improve both PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
We're also not trying to &quot;dumb down stats.&quot; Complexity and depth are two different things. Depth is really important to us. Without it, the game starts to get predictable and stale. Complexity can be a route to depth, but it doesn't have to be. The game of go has very simple rules but almost limitless depth (you can use chess if you aren't familiar with go). The game tic-tac-toe has very simple rules and almost no depth. It's hard to come up with examples that lots of players will get for games with too much complexity and not enough depth, mostly because those games either never become widely popular or don't endure. Ever heard the phrase &quot;quick to learn but a lifetime to master?&quot; That's depth.<br />
<br />
Yes, we are messing with talent trees, but a simple skimming of the forums should suggest why. There are too many talents that have little depth but are mandatory (most of the talents right about the 51-pointer). There are possibly interesting talents that you can't afford because of the passive dps / healing / tanking increasers. There are also modifications we need to make just because you'll have 5 more talent points. There are also talents that we have modified along the course of LK in the name of closer spec balance that are now out of budget. We're not deleting any talent trees and starting over. We're trying to make them more interesting and more fun. <br />

Or you are just homophobic? :) (It is indeed 'interesting'.. but that's it)<br />
<br />
Didn't they say they wanted to step back talking about cataclysm? Well anyway, I don't get why everyone gets so excited about the talent tree changes and thinks it could be a bad thing. People think they won't be OP anymore? (facerolladin speaking here) Let them do their job and complain about imbalance when beta is out.</div></div><hr />

1) more beasts<br />

4) more damage. <br />
<br />
I hope that the other fights aren't &quot;harder&quot; by simply having a code monkey make bigger numbers in the fight stats....I was kind of hoping for new mechanics, new things to watch out for, new abilities, new raid coordination etc etc....<br />

<br />
<br />
Beasts have more health and will one shot people but there are the same amounts. They do an aoe slow and gain 300% damage after a few seconds of being out. The snare is 80% slow and lasts about 10 seconds after being applied to anyone.<br />
<br />
And yes he gains rp like a mofo. It's key to spread out and reduce rp gain from boiling blood, plus no one can afford to get smacked by a beast. Too many marks gets hard to heal and a single mark death is a wipe.<br />
<br />
Pretty tough stuff compared to the other none attempt-limited bosses after him.</div></div><hr />

Even if so, its not always bad way to make hard modes by just increasing numbers. That fight has allready enough mechanics going on, so better then having it tetris style bigger numbers looks like the nice way to do HM.<br />
<br />
But having all fights just being multiplied by some number would be silly.</div></div><hr />

They need to nerf Queens tbh, unlimited movement in 8 directions in OP. Pawns could use a buff though, unfortunately it seems like every clueless noob on my server rolled one though. You can't fill a BG without half the team being pawns and the slow nabcakes are little more than a meat shield. Yeah, their ability to turn into any other class sounds really good on paper but the reality is that so few of them live long enough to use it that it badly needs some sort of buff.</div></div><hr />

Great, he's gay, I get that. A couple of problems:<br />
<br />
1) I don't read WoW webcomics to have a political agenda shoved down my throat. If you can bring up him being gay and have a decent story about it, fine.<br />
2) Sanctioning violence against someone because they don't swing they way you do? That's just wonderful. I'm all for tolerance but it swings both ways.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, their ability to turn into any other class sounds really good on paper but the reality is that so few of them live long enough to use it that it badly needs some sort of buff.<br />

<br />
1) I don't read WoW webcomics to have a political agenda shoved down my throat. If you can bring up him being gay and have a decent story about it, fine.<br />
2) Sanctioning violence against someone because they don't swing they way you do? That's just wonderful. I'm all for tolerance but it swings both ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you find the idea of cartoon violence against cartoon characters offensive why do you play WoW?</div></div><hr />

Did you see the rejection? If you get this stereotypical &quot;macho guy&quot; (aka the warrior) calling a gay person a fag, and meaning it in a demeaning way, they take it very offensively. It ended up making the character cry, and thats when his friends get revenge on the guy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lilbuddhaman</div><div class="date">2010-02-15, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So are there ANY fights where the &quot;hard&quot; mode is a dramatically new encounter, on the level of Mimiron or 0 Lights ?<br />
<br />
I was expecting:<br />
<br />
Deathwhisper - She out and running around the entire fight<br />
Gunship - Someone would HAVE to jump around and debuff everything with the rocket pack debuff or else mobs would hit too fast/hard<br />
Saurfang - Some kind of raid movement element added , this would greatly increase difficulty but still be &quot;doable&quot;... such as a collapse<br />
Rotface/Festergut - Gain each other's abilities , Slime on the ground doesn't go away (increase dps race)<br />
Putricide - Add another potion phase with a new ability ( pick one, think of one, you could add almost anything to spice it up )<br />
Dreamwalker - Add another type of mob, add more ground AoEing, put a type of add in the portals, though this is one of those fights were just upping the difficulty/hp/damage is probably enough<br />
Sindragosa - Require fighting the other two dragons at same time, they have 1 ability each ( take your pick at what it might be )<br />
<br />
Blood Princes - Another fight where added hp / damage might be enough .. perhaps add another orb type floating around<br />
Blood Queen - To my understanding healing becomes pretty easy near the end, maybe add something to make it tougher ?<br />
<br />
Lich King - I don't know enough about this fight to really add something onto it, BUT in my opinion this fight should be drastically different, such as an entire new phase ... but from the looks of it, just doubling his HP is their plan... boo hoo.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying that the macho guy handled it well, but if he was asking that question to a girl and was similarly turned down and his friends went and beat her up it would not be funny. Making him gay does not make it funny.<br />

Also, WoW is a game and is not a gaming webcomic trying to make a political/social statement, so the violence here has a bit different context.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can say the same thing about Haste, Crit, Expertise, Hit, Strength, Agility... ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
Their comment is fucking retarded, just because ArP has been dumbed down by spreadsheets and &quot;What does EJ say about it?&quot; doesn't mean that it's any less &quot;complicated&quot; than any other stat in this game.<br />
<br />
The math is actually really involved with ArP, and its effect changes based on the Armor of your target AND how much you have. It's the only stat that makes what you already have get better as you get more of it (Haste, Crit, etc are all the opposite of that).<br />
<br />
ArP is not lacking in depth compared to the rest of this game.</div></div><hr />

As for Cataclysm, I don't think there's one thing about it I'm not looking forward to. Simplification of the stats on items gives them more room to put things like the oh-so-interesting and fun procs that some of the items in ICC have. It will actually make gearing more interesting and deep because instead of just trying to find the right balance of the myriad stats, you will have to determine the worth of the procs on items vs procs on other items. And the trimming of the talent trees is nothing but good. Fun talents like Body and Soul shouldn't have to take a back seat boring but practical talents like +5% more healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
political agenda? a gay cartoon character has nothing to do with politics... you're the only one with a political agenda here.<br />
<br />
also: even if this cartoon had a political agenda, why shouldn't it? they can do with their cartoons whatever they like. if you don't like it, don't read it.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Sanctioning violence against someone because they don't swing they way you do? That's just wonderful. I'm all for tolerance but it swings both ways.<br />
<br />
it's a cartoon, no one's sanctioning violence against anyone. if you're not able to separate real life from fiction, you shouldn't be playing a game like WoW.<br />
<br />
the warrior doesn't just &quot;not swing this way&quot;. he calls keydar a fag, wich is a derogative and homophobic term. being gay is not the same thing as being homophobic. it's not about free speech and different opinions here... intolerance is not tolerable. intolerant people claiming tolerance for their opinions are just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Collix</div><div class="date">2010-02-16, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can say the same thing about Haste, Crit, Expertise, Hit, Strength, Agility... ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with this comparison is that you're looking at the different stats as they are now and comparing it to how armor penetration will work in Cataclysm. Strength and Agility are core stats, just like Spirit and Intellect for casters, it is their job to be a straight buff without any other interesting mechanic, which is exactly what is armor-pen is doing right now. So yes they do the same thing, that is the problem. <br />
<br />
Hit and Expertise are very similar to each other but are different from every other stat in that they stop providing any value at all after you are capped. This makes for interesting gear decisions because you have to get as close to the cap as possible without going to far over in order to maximize your stat allocation. This creates &quot;depth&quot; in the game play because stacking hit to infinity is not in your best interest. While this might sound similar to armor-pen at first, the intention is different. Hit is meant to be something that everyone needs, but only in small amounts because it's not hard to cap it if you try.<br />
<br />
Haste and Crit are meant to be the secondary stats in Cataclysm, along with Mastery. They both provide a benefit, but in an interesting way that makes you think about stacking only one. For casters, haste increases your damage by letting you cast more spells over the same amount of time, this lets you have more chances to proc on cast things but has the drawback of being mana intensive. Crit, on the other hand, lets you do more damage but relies on the RNG a lot if you are in a world where someone's total critical chance is around 30% instead of 60-70% because of gear inflation. Critical hits also proc certain effects similar to how 'on cast' procs are benefited by haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Their comment is fucking retarded, just because ArP has been dumbed down by spreadsheets and &quot;What does EJ say about it?&quot; doesn't mean that it's any less &quot;complicated&quot; than any other stat in this game.<br />
<br />
The math is actually really involved with ArP, and its effect changes based on the Armor of your target AND how much you have. It's the only stat that makes what you already have get better as you get more of it (Haste, Crit, etc are all the opposite of that).<br />
<br />
ArP is not lacking in depth compared to the rest of this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the reasons Blizzard has stated for removing armor-pen is that it is too complicated to understand without doing some out of game calculations. (Or having someone else do them for you in the case on EJ Forums.) While forum browsing for the best possible spec and stats might be normal for a lot of end game players, myself included, it is not for everyone and is not required. Making the reasons for choosing a certain stat easier to see does not make the actual decision easier, it still requires you to know the mechanics of your class. This is a good thing for the game as, hopefully, more players will intuitively know or be able to figure out which stats to choose, raising the performance level of the average player base.<br />
<br />
Armor-pen lacks depth for the reason you listed to support it having depth, it simply gets better the more you with no drawbacks or other thought put into the choice. This is something only the base stats should do for your class, and is the same reason for Attack Power and Spell Power being consolidated into said base stats. Also, while you may argue that it has a cap and this somehow makes it interesting, in reality it would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to hard cap it if stats had progressed at the intended rate instead of without compensating for hard modes. (As it will be in Cataclysm) The cap on armor-pen is the same as the haste cap in this regard, there is a point when stacking haste is no longer beneficial because your spells become shorter than the global cooldown, something that is not likely to happen unless you use a haste buff during Bloodlust/Heroism.<br />
<br />
I apologize for that being so long, but I felt like people weren't really understanding the reasons for the stat changes and complaining without being informed. This is not meant as an attack or argument against the person I quoted, more of an explanation I think some people were looking for.</div></div><hr />

I agree that fag is a very negative term, but the cartoon is more about Keydar getting rejected and beating the person up because he rejected Keydar.<br />
<br />
You say being gay is not the same as being homophobic, obviously Keydar wanted the guy to be gay and the guy wanted Keydar to not be gay. I don't see the difference in the context of this comic. I don't care that Keydar's gay, it just doesn't make the comic funny (especially since he's done pretty much the exact same joke before minus the violence). That's not intolerance, that's criticism of the author's taste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming they completely ignore two classes to make their job easier, it would still be very difficult. That is why they make these posts say &quot;We're not perfect, but we try and do our best to improve the game&quot;. That's not really glossing over it, more of sharing the reason why in addition to getting the basic point across.<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S. I hate that people think the comic has to be politically correct for the fear that it might contain some hidden agenda to shape your views. It is a video game comic not a political cartoon, the only goal here is to make you laugh and enjoy the game more.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is. The author made this comic about being gay. He didn't have to make that guy call Keydar a fag. That's what this comic is about. That is the statement being made. He also used violence to illustrate his point. Granted, that is a trend throughout all his comics, and it does work for some of them. It just simply does not help this comic's plot or humor or anything.<br />
<br />
Basically:<br />
1) Violence in this particular story does not lend itself to the story being funny.<br />
2) Having Keydar be gay just for the sake of enabling the &quot;villain&quot; to call him a derogatory name is not funny either.</div></div><hr />

if keydar was a girl and her friends would have beaten the macho man up for insulting and rejecting her, we would not be having this conversation. you would not have felt the need to comment on the cartoon not being funny. the only reason you just HAD to comment, was that keydar is gay. and it's really all that bothers you.</div></div><hr />

Making him gay does not make it funny.<br />
<br />
It's not the turning down that made his friends mad, it's the demeaning and homophobic way he did it. &quot;Sorry, I don't swing that way&quot; or even &quot;Sorry, but I don't like you&quot; are turn downs. &quot;Ew, get away from me fag&quot; is deliberately insulting, and not only to the person asking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, WoW is a game and is not a gaming webcomic trying to make a political/social statement, so the violence here has a bit different context.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's political? He's gay, he's relating what is no doubt a real life experience for him. I'm not gay myself, but I have several gay friends. Nearly all of them have, at one point or another, had the simple act of asking someone out turn ugly. One even had it turn physical. Despite rumors to the contrary, &quot;gaydar&quot; is not perfect. Sometimes gay men ask out straight men by mistake. It is reasonable to tell them no. It is not reasonable to act like they just offered to impale you on a stake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) I don't read WoW webcomics to have a political agenda shoved down my throat. If you can bring up him being gay and have a decent story about it, fine.<br />
2) Sanctioning violence against someone because they don't swing they way you do? That's just wonderful. I'm all for tolerance but it swings both ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, there's a difference between &quot;not swinging the way you do&quot; and insulting and derogatory behavior. In the real world of course, you would not sanction beating the shit out of someone who called someone else a name. Luckily this is a comic, not the real world. We've all had fantasies about beating up someone who insulted us/hurt us/broke our hearts. He can draw his fantasies. If the character getting rejected had been female, and the warrior had said &quot;GTFO you bitch, I don't date WoW players&quot;, you'd have considered the whole thing amusing or not on it's own merits. The author happens to be gay and bases his character off himself. Therefore you saw this instead. No gay agenda, no political statement, just a person who got rejected in a rude and demeaning way fantasizing about smacking the rejector around a bit.<br />

In order to do this, I have of course changed the main character to Megan Fox - who is called a skank. This kind of remark of course deserves that the evil (now gay) man gets clobbered. This should be found equally funny to those that enjoyed it the first time around. Enjoy:<br />

Your choice of words in this context is priceless.<br />

Anyway I thought the comic was funny, if you didn't don't get your panties in a twist and get over it. Humour is as subjective as taste and shouldn't be a reason to start an endless rant in a news discussion, complain about the crappy rotations/gear choices/UI/OMFGCLICKERS from the videos instead. If for some reason you feel truly offended by the comic you have two choices:<br />
A: Get over it and stop reading the thing, nobody is forcing you.<br />
B: Take it up with the author. It's as annoying as people complaining about Blizzard on here, they don't see it and therefore they don't care.</div></div><hr />

I saw the double entendre after I posted, but decided it was worth keeping :-)</div></div><hr />
