Zandalari Island Area Preview<br />
In previous posts (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219519-the-zandalari/), on the Blizzcon Pandaria map (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/pp04.jpg), and in interviews (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1099149-Mists-of-Pandaria-Press-Tour-Official-FAQ), a Zandalari Island off the coast of Pandaria has been mentioned, which might be the unlabeled island (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/worldMapIsland.jpg) in the northwest corner of the current World Map. <br />
<br />
Important - As usual, this is WORK IN PROGRESS. The screenshots and video do not reflect the final version of the area.<br />

<br />
Cloud Serpent Questing Area<br />
A previous interview mentioned that you would be able to raise your own cloud serpent through ~20 days of daily quests, which would involve things like racing. One area of Jade Forest has trainers, cloud serpents in training, race spectators, and an island right off the coast with level 90 mobs and an instructor. <br />
<br />
There are also several NPCs that mention joining the training program after you have some more experience. One of the NPCs in this area of The Arboretum has a quest that is not accessible yet at level 87. It is likely that this area will be the area you do some of the Cloud Serpent questing in.<br />

Leaders of Azeroth: Velen Short Story Now Available<br />
Not long ago, the prophet Velen and a number of draenei resettled on Azeroth, hoping to put a halt to the Legion’s murderous activities in Outland. Sensing great courage in the Alliance, the draenei pledged themselves to this noble faction.<br />
<br />
Yet much time has passed since then. The Legion's forces in Outland have been greatly diminished. Now, Velen must guide his people into an uncertain future and decide what role, if any, the draenei will play in the Alliance.<br />
<br />
The Seat of the Naaru's soaring energies inspired inner peace from the most bloodthirsty of warrior pilgrims, awe from even the most jaded of Azeroth's inhabitants. The figure floating before the Seat had long taken comfort from this column of Light. Velen looked out from his meditation chamber, seeking insight. . . in all the connections, great and small, where he might perceive the lines of the future. For the past several months, those lines had increasingly felt fragmented.<br />
<br />
As the Prophet of the draenei meditated -- his legs crossed beneath him, his hands resting on his ancient knees -- the crystals that reflected his energies glowed and pulsed and swirled around him, not in patterns but in chaos. And the visions, the endless possibilities of tomorrows, assaulted him.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment is proud to present the latest entry in the &quot;Leaders of Azeroth&quot; short story series: Prophet's Lesson (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/leader-story/velen/1)! <br />

As adventurers gear up to battle demonic hordes with the impending launch of Diablo III, the World of Warcraft Annual Pass (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3767193/Sign_Up_for_the_World_of_Warcraft_Annual_Pass_and_Get_Diablo_III_Free-10_21_2011#blog) offer will soon close to new sign ups. If you plan on questing in both Sanctuary and Azeroth in the coming year and haven’t signed up yet, the Annual Pass is a great value that should not be missed.<br />

After April 30, this offer will no longer be available. <br />

<br />
Grinding a guild to level 30 for a ten percent discount on a 100g-200g service you use periodically?<br />
<br />
That's garbage.<br />
<br />
I think Have Group, Will Travel should be limited to 2 other people, basically enough to use a summoning stone or spawn a lock summoning stone. It removes how trivial it has become, but still allows it to be useful in situations where you need to bring guild members together.<br />
<br />
Time Off is nice, especially with the number of people leveing Panda alts from level one. I sure hope it stacks with that racial bonus tho.<br />
<br />
All in all, guilds are going to be much less valuable and I don't see any reason at all to work towards 30 if that's the best they can do.</div></div><hr />

Obviously these serve alts. But now we really don't have much benefit for being max level in a level 30 guild. Really, the only thing to look forward to is the void storage and transmog thing. As a mog-o-holic, this will save me thousands. <br />
But its not worth taking out chug-a-lug, and honestly, have group will travel is amazing, as a 10 man guild, you really only had 2 people summoning at the portal, it really was the same as is now, but just took longer.</div></div><hr />

I kinda like the instant ports in Rift.<br />
<br />
ie: add some mage port npc's, roughly 1 per zone. Interact, select destination, pay the fee, and bam!<br />
<br />
Cutting 11 minute taxi rides to 9 minutes really isn't going to encourage people to get out and about.</div></div><hr />

I guess just to spite blizzard and their new perks your whole guild could leave the guild at 90 and raid by calendar invites. A guild is not some perk whore (except for alts) it is a social group (to some degree) that plan events and work together like in raiding or pvp. And yeah have group will travel was awesome.... but oh well, maybe mass teleportation for mages? Could happen.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what Blizzard is trying to prevent you from doing. They WANT you to fly/walk/flightpath there.</div></div><hr />

Have Group, Will Travel - It can only be used at the side of a meeting stone.<br />

Athene was the one behind the Dragon Soul Challenge, and like the DS Challenge, as far as im aware, all of the money from this event will go to OPSharecraft to help them reach the goal. So it's not really a copy considering they are helping him.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you mean by that, but if you take a closer look at the link provided, it's just a sub-fundraiser for the Sharecraft. So all the money that Nik and Kevin manage to raise goes straight to the Sharecraft pot. Whatever Athene is going to do Monk Leveling, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I read you don't need the Serpent Mount to fly in Pandaria... you just need to hit 90 and you're immediately flying. <br />
<br />
The serpent mount is just a cool serpent mount you get via a series of daily quests. :P</div></div><hr />

As for the new perks, i like them but they seem like lower level perks instead of upper level perks and honestly 30 needs to be better then what it is, that perk seems more like a 4 or 5 level perk but it also seems like blizzard is trying to fix the perks so people dont think they have to join a level 30 guild. Who knows though its still beta so stop bitching so early in the game, blizzard can easily change those levels and perks 20 times before the retail launch, people really need to stop basing the game off beta, its a fing beta the point is to test if crap works and get feed back on it not sit in forums and bitch like its set in stone.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and I'm sure all that time spent grinding up rep killing hundreds of ogres for obsidian warbeads, or grinding up rep to get into heroic dungeons in BC, or farming mats for resistance sets to kill one boss to progress in the raid, were just rip-snortin' good times, right? <br />
<br />
face-to-the-wall bland, repetitive grinds like these were nothing but gates, which themselves were really just a &quot;cheap way to make us spend more time in game.&quot; However, many people often site those as being among the best times they've spent in WoW. <br />
<br />
So before you start shlepping blizzard off for trying to waste player's time, consider what they USED to do, and know that these few new changes (back to the way things WERE, mind you, not a fundamental backwards leap) are comparatively nothing time-investment wise.</div></div><hr />

I guess just to spite blizzard and their new perks your whole guild could leave the guild at 90 and raid by calendar invites. A guild is not some perk whore (except for alts) it is a social group (to some degree) that plan events and work together like in raiding or pvp. And yeah have group will travel was awesome.... but oh well, maybe mass teleportation for mages? Could happen.<br />
Their argument is that it removes some intangible experience, so it will make sense to see it not added back in. There won't be a significant experience change from it, it's just some stuff they want to change so they can feel self important.</div></div><hr />

I can do without have group will travel (unwillingly but I can do without), but increasing guild cauldron useage is just putting more strain on guild members to farm or spend gold. Ideally though, instead of getting rid of have group will travel, they should instead ummm you know, make the world worth going out into? Why would I go to hyjal at 85? Why would I go to Vashj'ir? Why Uldum? Twilight highlands? All the zones are so far apart with literally NOTHING for max level characters to do there. Of course we are going to sit in our main cities.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard took it away because they think that it made everyone lazy and didn't se enough of the environment, most of the time when there is a raid 1 guy goes to the raid(usually a mage) then just summons everyone, blizz wants that to change they want you to have to fly to se and explore more of the world then just when you are grinding quests for achivements or leveling.</div></div><hr />

I did all that too and am glad it is gone as I'd rather spend time in instances/raids than having to grind more than necessary to be there. It does not change the way I feel about the removal of chug a lug. It is a very convenient way of making flasks for the whole group and with the new system it will cover 7 people for one hour instead of 10 for two hours which in turn will mean even more mindless grinding. Next thing might be to remove cap on flasks, elixirs and potions so we are back to Vanilla times with 90 per cent spent herbing/chasing mats for pots and 10 per cent actually doing what is fun.<br />
<br />
Why bring that up in the first place Kalerdar? It has been gone for quite some time but we have chug a lug today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly what exploring do you mean? A max level character has (ideally) seen all the new zones and if you aren't into achieving loremaster, you hardly ever get to see the other zones. Have group will travel was a time-saver for raids, nothing more. If there is no benefit from traveling around Azeroth, then there is no point beyond sightseeing and occasional RP. And maybe archeology, but the places are fixed even if the spawn-points are random. Azeroth is big, beautiful, but that's not enough to get me out of Orgrimmar to do exploring. And you can't forget: the world is static. Once you've seen it, you've seen it all. Maybe you have your favorite places that you like to revisit, but that's it. You don't meet NPC on your routes, you can't change the world... etcetc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jesus Christ, isnt your post fucking stupid. I swear, post like yours are even worse than post with people saying &quot;LOL XY IS OP, PLZ NERF&quot;. Have you read the other posts in this thread ? Everyone seem to dislike the Guild Perk changes. Like EVERYBODY. So, of course people complains here and of course, mainy people read the complains and care about them - why would you thing people would share their opinions if others didnt care ? The reason this website exist is precisly because people care about what other people think about Wow, and enjoy discussing things, even if Blizzard dont read them all. And, by the way, about Blizzard, you can be sure they check the community feedback on popular places like MMO Champion - probably not deep inside the Forum, but front page feedback FOR SURE. So, stop beeing a Blizz fanboi, and accept people have other opinion than yours, and accept that they express their opinions ? Also dont worry, some people will go on Blizz forum and create threads about this, but giving your opinion on MMO C is a legit way to share your thoughts about this game.<br />
<br />
And FYI I quit wow a year ago, so I couldnt care less, but i enjoy reading MMO Champion from time to time, and post like yours make my blood boil, because they are just dumb. &quot;If you dont like the changes then quit&quot; I mean really, is that everything you have to say ? Do you even know what a Beta is ? So according to you, people should just take Beta changes for granted and quit the game if they dislike some changes ? If a majority of people dislike something, you can be sure Blizz will do something about it. In this case, Guild Perks will change FOR SURE, because they are just dull. And if you dont like my post, then I guess you could quit MMO Champion ? C wut i did thar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Doctor Is In - you only really ever use bandage in BGs and arenas so this is pointless.<br />
For Great Justice - only useful for alts as mains you will only ever farm valor points.<br />
Ride Like the Wind - ok this 1 might actually have purposes, might.<br />
Working Overtime - this 1 would be good for griding proffs like fishing and archeology if you even bother with them, but mostly useful for alts.<br />
Time Off - again more for alts since mains will get VERY little rest other than over night.<br />
Otherworldly Discounts - now this has got to be the biggest bag of bull crap ever, 10% off some think that costs like 100-200g so all ur saving is 10-20g and not every 1 even bothers with transmog and void storage so this is 100% pointless, or bring it in at a lower lvl at like 5-8 and have some think better at 30.<br />
<br />
and removing the best perks wtf is that about, they are the perks that make the whole perk system worth it, and mass rez the rest are just meh and now ur adding more meh perks, u can just leave the guild and just get the invites on ur calendar now.</div></div><hr />

As for the new perks, i like them but they seem like lower level perks instead of upper level perks and honestly 30 needs to be better then what it is, that perk seems more like a 4 or 5 level perk but it also seems like blizzard is trying to fix the perks so people dont think they have to join a level 30 guild. Who knows though its still beta so stop bitching so early in the game, blizzard can easily change those levels and perks 20 times before the retail launch, people really need to stop basing the game off beta, its a fing beta the point is to test if crap works and get feed back on it not sit in forums and bitch like its set in stone.<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me? people we're just sitting in towns, trolling, showing off mounts for hours as far back as Vanilla. I will agree that HGWT has spoiled a lot of players, however at the same time HGWT has also been a blessing of convenience for just as many. The ability to quickly summon your raid group, friends to help you with a quest/world boss/etc, or those PuGs who has no idea how to get to BH, has saved many wasted hours of travel and waiting. Not to mention it had a 2 hour CD - so it was not like it could've been abused - if anything it made travel &quot;convenient' 2-3 times a day (more or less depending on how long you play a day and how frequently you use it).<br />
<br />
The idea that removing HGWT will &quot;encourage&quot; players to &quot;go out and explore more&quot; is rubbish, if Blizzard actually wanted players to explore the world outside of Main City Hubs, they'd actually put something there for players to explore, removing a convenient means of travel isn't going to encourage people to leave the city unless they already had intention to leave the city, and if anything, people will just hop on a taxi and alt+tab (cause the taxi are like those in RL they like to take the longest and most inconvenient route possible).<br />

The main reason of removing the mass summon is not only about some players got lazy over the time but also about the WoW world overall got way too small with flying mount + mass summon = very small world which make some ppl get bored of this game so fast then they will start to whine to ask more content and faster content. Mass summon is indeed convienent and useful but also ruined WoW world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
.. people got bored of this game, not because the world felt smaller as a result of flying mount + mass summon. But because the majority of development that went into Cataclysm was revamping 1-60 leveling zone, of which the only people who got to enjoy it was people who bothered to go back and do Loremaster to see the changes, or new players who had to go through the leveling process.<br />
<br />
People got bored and wanted more content because there was NOTHING to do outside of raiding or PvP, and even then raiding has been lackluster this expansion compared to the others.<br />
<br />
I will say it again, removing HGWT isn't going to change anything in terms of world activity, the new Pet Battle System and the &quot;Gotta Catch'em All&quot; mentality of players will be what gets people out of the city. The only difference will be that instead of players AFK alt-tabbing while waiting for a summon, they will now be AFK alt-tabbing while riding a taxi to their destination.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thejudgement</div><div class="date">2012-04-24, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HGWT is one of the most useful perk imo when it comes to mobility. In my guild for example we just play casual, do old school raids to farm gear for transmo. HGWT is also a nice thing to actually get people into the world when it comes to world pvp or attacks on capital cities. I understand the way how some of you describe it as &quot;making people spoiled&quot; but at the same time you are also making it WAY more easy for your group to get started.<br />
Back in classic it could take like forever if you had to make your way from Silithus to the Eastern Plaguelands just to get to Stratholme and some groups fel apart before they even got there just because it took so long to get there. Later Blizz added the summon stone function to summon but you needed at least 2 players and now they have an even better alternative for it; HGWT. If you want to get back into the world then remove Dungeon and Raid finder and start moving by yourself instead. Then you get the outdoor pvp back at the summon stones for example like how it used to be in Classic =&gt; Horde camping the summon stone at SM.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you that Cata raids are not as good as previous expansions. However, saying that Blizzard forcing the player to waste time ingame is wrong to be honest because don't we all play this video game when we have spare time in our real life and want the time to pass while we play this game?<br />
<br />
Saying that there is nothing to do outside of raid and pvp is not the game problem it's the players themselves. I see so many players do so many things outside of pvp and raiding, Archaeology, farming, farming rare mounts, killing rare mob spawns (Frostbitten, Bloody rare), farming mounts and pets, dailies and much more.<br />
<br />
See? it's the way of the player who play this game I'm not saying the game is perfect nope far from it and I agree with you raids are not that good this expansion but, saying that ppl got bored because there is nothing to do outside of pvp and raids it's the players problem it's their game style the way they play the game what makes them get bored not the game itself because unfortunately some ppl see WoW as nothing but raid, and pvp and nothing else which is completely wrong this game is not just about raid and pvp there are so many things outside of these two catagories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
..and that is what can make HGWT something useful. Not just for the lazy peeps out there but in case a guildy or a friend is farming or working on archaeology , you can get summoned to that player and continue with what you were doing instead of loafing around while sitting on a flight path.</div></div><hr />

When people cry for more to do...I'm not sure longer travel times was what they had in mind. Having raided since vanilla...I like getting going on time. Hated waiting for 39...24...even 9 other people to get a move on and be at an appropriate location on time. Great...now we're back to my time being wasted because some asshat can't find their way to where they should be going on time.<br />
Chug-a-lug...Happy Hour...those are head scratchers. Like...what was wrong with those?<br />

Just seems like they took stuff that was actually useful for a Guild...a group...and got rid of it in favor of individual perks.<br />

...=/ are you actually reading your reasoning behind trying to justify the removal of HGWT?<br />
<br />
How does the removal of HGWT automatically encourage people to go out and do the things you mention like: Archeology, Farming for rare mounts, Camping NPC rare spawns, dailies and etc? <br />
<br />
It doesn't, you can't mass summon yourself to a dig site, you can't mass summon yourself to a questing hub, you can't mass summon yourself to an entrance of a dungeon.<br />
<br />
The people who are out there doing the things you mention, are out there doing it because they enjoy doing it, not because they have HGWT... <br />
<br />
Your reasoning implies that the people who are &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;idling&quot; in city hubs, aren't out doing those mentioned above, because they are waiting for someone to &quot;mass summon&quot; them to the location of that activity... <br />
<br />
Which brings me back to my main point, removing HGWT isn't going to encourage any world activity, that's an illusion, people aren't going to leave the city hub more than they have too, regardless of having HGWT, the only thing that comes from removing the perk is that, each players will now have to make their own way to their destination, through other means, but let's be honest, the majority of us will just go back to the days before HGWT and just AFK alt-tab while riding a taxi.</div></div><hr />

Mate you misundertood me here I didn't say removing HGWT will make ppl do more dailies, archaeology and all of these stuff I mention you these kinda stuff because you said people get bored because there is nothing to do outside of raiding and pvp then I answered you with that. The things I mention about it's ppl problem that they get bored because as I said some ppl see this game as nothing but raids and pvp only which is wrong this game is more than these two catagories there are so many features and fun inside this game other than raids and pvp. I said that to answer the thing you said about ppl get bored of content because there is nothing to do outside raiding and pvp it's not about removing HGWT. :) you misunderstood me.</div></div><hr />

The flight distance from town to raid entrance is a part of the world that - after 100 flights over it - I'll be more than HAPPY to have feel small.<br />
<br />
As another poster mentioned, the world only felt small because the new zones just &quot;popped up&quot; through portals - two of them were actually self-contained bubbles, literally.<br />
Everyone just sat around in Dalaran in Wrath, but the world didn't feel disjointed and tiny back at that time, honestly.<br />
<br />
And... racing?!? Seriously, Blizz... wtf... not again. <br />
Some of the worst quests I've done (Netherwing) - seriously, EVER.<br />
Maybe part of the quest chain can be jumping platforms with poor collision detection, while they are at it...</div></div><hr />

Making every zone accessible via portals from Org did far more damage to the size and feel of the world than Mass Summons ever did.<br />
<br />
Yes I agree I never liked so many portals in the game tbh. It's the main reason why I hated DS raid not because of reskin bosses or anything like that but because of a lot of portals inside this raid making it less attractive for me.</div></div><hr />

Mass summon isn't super bad in that it cuts down more on the abuse warlocks get, although I admit it i have met some friends hanging out at message stones. It's things like that that encourage you to interact with others in this game, big or small.<br />
<br />
However, city portals; with the introduction of flying mounts, it's silly that they are in the game to begin with. I saw a case for them when you needed to go to capital cities from Dal quite a bit if you wanted to respec, AH etc. But nowadays? It's 100% convenience that encourages laziness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Despite the comment correction below about &quot;options&quot;, I believe bliz actually does want us to waste more time. There's a fraction of the player base for whom completionism is a chronic compulsion. If bliz builds it, they will grind it. For whichever portions of the population exhibit this trait and to whichever degree, the aggregate effect of scaling the time occupied by these activities will stretch out the duration that a fraction of the playerbase continues to renew subscriptions. I can't speak for others, but I have a hard enough time grinding out the more difficult aspects of existing content as is (eg. Weekly solo clear of Molten Core for 3 years without EVER seeing Eye of Sulfuras drop). The usual debate about drop rates and how harder things feel more rewarding ensues (I call BS on the whole concept). I don't welcome changes which make the existing grind harder/longer.<br />
<br />
A number of people have echoed the suggestion for a droprate bonus for not-yet-seen rare drops which would stack and reset as you grind. This would at least put an upper bound on &quot;bad luck&quot;. Grats to those lucky SOBs who get rivendare's mount on the first try. I'd like to at least have an end in sight for the grind which doesn't scale into the thousands of attempts.</div></div><hr />

Also, summoning people to help out or kill rares is just going to go back to the painful, waste of time it used to be. I feel like some people int his thread are trying to say that being on a flight master route somehow makes the game feel bigger? You still have 1 destination, and flying from path to path, hopping on boat to switch continent, hopping on another long, drawn out flight path again just makes the world seem slow, boring and if you have to go too far then somewhat discouraging. Back when you couldn't fly and I had to get somewhere really far, either for a holiday achievement or what have you, I was more inclined to just call it a wrap, then to waste an hour of my life getting to a different section of the game.<br />

My opinion is that they removed HGWT because of the world bosses. They dont want one guys alt camping the spawn and then summoning the entire 40 man group to the fight, they want all 40 to camp and maybe fight with the other faction.<br />
<br />
I dont think its too much to ask to have a HGWT that just summons your group. It would allow people to still get help with quests and summon to dungeons without a hassle. Even if you chain summoned it would take a while and be pretty cumbersome. The other option would be just to not allow you to use it within 1000yd or whatever of the area the boss spawns at.<br />

No now you can hop on a few minutes before the raid and wait for 2 people to go summon or 2 people and a lock. The only difference is how long it takes to summon the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again, Blizz is screwing over raiders (not only with removal of HGWT but with removal of Chug-a-lug) to appease casual players, because they know raiders will just shrug and take on the extra responsibility and the casuals will whine if they see a perceived benefit they're not getting because they can't be a productive member of a guild. It's not even like you have to belong to a serious, or even hardcore guild, after all, guild levels are much easier to get in large, anonymous social guilds.<br />
<br />
It's to the point now that my 2nd 90 that I'll be levelling in that first week will be my druid, just so I can farm for our first raid. A 4 hour raid, 3 times a week, removal of mixology, means we're going to need 12 cauldrons a week, and then extras for subs.</div></div><hr />

Most times i see it being used is to helpout someone with a quest who is for instance in the middle of Northrend, which takes way to long to get to unless he can summon you. Meaning asking for help is now turning again into half hour of your time instead of minutes. And when we are raiding and some rl thing happens or a long dc and we like to replace a person with someone on reserve. Which means that person has to now fly all the way to the raid, which can be brutal if his hs is on cd, and 24 people have to wait and do nothing. It was a great invention and it should not be removed imo</div></div><hr />

No special form. Literally the only way to donate to the MMO-Champion stream is during this short period and you actually donate straight to the Save the Children fundraiser (No money touches our hands).

There is more in this game than just raiding really..pvp, farming material as you said, farming rare mobs, pets, rare spawn mobs, archaeology, professions, questing, and hunting achievements and much much more it's all about your play style.

Who knows though its still beta so stop bitching so early in the game, blizzard can easily change those levels and perks 20 times before the retail launch, people really need to stop basing the game off beta, its a fing beta the point is to test if crap works and get feed back on it not sit in forums and bitch like its set in stone.<br />
<br />
How is getting rid of group travel really getting people out into the world? It only means using fp to closest point and then flying to raid/dungeon and standing around waiting for everyone else to get summoned. Remember waiting outside raids with all the people from other groups crowding around the summoning stone, and trying to click your group's summoning port instead of someone else's. Always so much fun since people like to stand around them on their dragons especially.</div></div><hr />

Actually you'll need to farm 4 times as many mats based on the changes, since we're losing both the duration buff perk and the number of flask perk.<br />
<br />
<br />

I realize everyone has limited time to play the game, but this is an MMO. (MASSIVELY Multiplayer online) Stop being selfish. WoW's playerbase was spoiled from HGWT. As a raider myself, it was handy. Especially for times when I couldn't log in until ~5minutes prior to the start of a raid. But in the end, it's a change for the good.<br />
<br />
Nope sorry it's the only reason I play WoW anymore is for the raiding. Think of all the 10mans without a warlock now. Having to go to town to replace someone and then now they have to travel all the way with you to the instance is not going to be fun. Sure at the start of an expansion I do every single quest there is and get dungeons done, but after and raiding starts it's all I care about doing.</div></div><hr />

Hell of a sexy set though.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of warlocks, isn't this going to cause a higher demand for them in raids? And if it does, what does that say about &quot;bring the player, not the class?&quot; Ah well, I really should have learned better than to expect consistency from Blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To me, 200 days for the new mount is a bit much. But 50 (2 months minus days off) would be about perfect.</div></div><hr />

I always imagined a huge island looking zul-gurub-ish with a huge astec temple(gundrak size atleast) in the middle, where Rastakhan would sit at the top of a throne.<br />
<br />
Not something chinese mogu shit with some huts off the coast....<br />
<br />
&quot;Zandalar is a sizeable island a ways southwest of Westfall. Two huge mountains rise from its green canopy; one of these mountains is in fact the great ziggurat-city Zuldazar, while the other is snowy Mount Mugamba. Other, smaller ziggurats — the domains of troll priests and witch doctors — also jut from the jungle, and birds and stranger beasts fl it above and among the trees. Troll priests and witch doctors live all over the island. It is a lush and tropical place, and a deadly one.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it is Zandalar Isle then I am hoping they change the Mogu-style back to the Ziggurats also... I -love- the Arathi Highlands and all those tiers of the huge temples ect. Right now it just says a Zandalari isle so hopefully it'll be an offshoot and not Zandalar it'self. Though I would adore to see the Isle of Zandalar being as my Troll is Zandalari (and has been from the beginning)<br />
<br />
As for HGWT, It's going to be missed as I run old school raids and it was a boon to be able to hop from raid to raid or add new people when we shifted from one to the other. I can live without it, but it will be greatly missed.</div></div><hr />

Or people could just fly to the damn raid. It's one unified continent to travel over... It's not like you have to get 40 people from Storwind to Silithus.</div></div><hr />

As for travelling lets wait and see . Mages might get portals to instances or near them and locks might be able to summon more than 1 person. Also a good raider is not someone that sits and wait to be summon but someone who is outside the instance ready to go in. <br />
<br />
On the other hand when people are used to have the candy in their mouths sudderly to remove it and place 1km away might cause alot of complains in the first month.</div></div><hr />
