<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stability Updates<br />
<br />
We’re continuing to work toward greater realm stability and address the service issues impacting latency. Our current biggest hurdle is the concentration of players in specific areas and zones, and an unexpected effect of that concentration on the realm stability. We’re continuing to maintain a lowered realm population cap to help with the stability, which is resulting in increased queue times. We’re seeing some increase in individual zones drop which are causing localized player disconnections as we get into primetime in the Americas, and if someone is disconnected they will quite likely run into a queue to log back in. Work is progressing on improving realm stability through fixes targeting individual in-game issues, as well as on the backend game and network services.<br />
<br />
[Update] 8:00 pm PST<br />
<br />
Our top priority continues to be service issues impacting performance and long wait times on North American realms. We recently pushed a server change that caused disconnects, and as a result login services are heavily impacted as players attempt to (re)log in to the game. If you experience issues logging in, please be patient and wait a few minutes before trying again. We’re continuing to work to address other stability and latency issues as well as make additional improvements in game performance.<br />
<br />
[Update] 9:00 p.m. PST<br />
<br />
We’ll be performing maintenance on all NA realms beginning at 5 a.m. PST in order to address issues with realm stability. We anticipate this process will last approximately 4 hours and appreciate your patience during this time.<br />
<br />

<br />
Newly Boosted Characters and Bypassing the Skill Unlock Process<br />
If you’ve recently boosted a new level 90 character for Warlords of Draenor, you will start within the blasted lands with a limited number of spells at your disposal. Once you go through the Dark Portal and as you progress through Tanaan Jungle, more spells and abilities will be unlocked. Once you’ve completed Tanaan Jungle, you should have most of your spells and abilities (for level 90) available to you. The remaining will be unlocked shortly after the beginning quests in Frostfire Ridge (for Horde) or Shadowmoon Valley (for Alliance). This system has been designed to help players who have newly boosted to ease into their new character.<br />
<br />
If you’re a veteran player and are absolutely sure that you want to skip this progression of spells and abilities, you can either swap specs or queue for an instance. This will unlock the remaining spells and abilities for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrison Access Issues<br />
We're tracking a few issues that are impeding access or progression with Garrisons. To address these issues we'll be restarting some Garrison services which will impact access to the Garrison for some realms. While these restarts progress, this may result in characters not being able to phase into the Garrison, or become temporarily stuck while phasing in. This is a temporary effect and should resolve as these services return.<br />
<br />
We're continuing to look into other issues outside of this impact on Garrison access, including realm latency and its affect on gameplay and questing elements. We've implemented dozens of hotfixes over the last few hours, and will be continuing to work toward resolution of any outstanding issues.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if the garrisons are working when we can't even quest do to the ridiculous lag.<br />
The majority of our fixes are aimed at issues that are resulting in latency. Latency itself is not a singular issue, but is the effect of many compound issues--a few of which are related to Garrisons.<br />

HandyNotes - Draenor<br />
The HandyNotes_DraenorTreasures (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes_draenortreasures) addon is especially useful while you are leveling, as there are lots of treasures and rare spawns that give experience, gold, items, and garrison resources. You need the base HandyNotes addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes) to run the Draenor module.<br />

How is this unexpected? they have had those same issues before, they know what happens when you put the whole server on one zone. I'm very dissapointed at how blizzard is handling this. My character got stuck trying to get into my garrison, now I'm reading they disabled some garrison services. Well, where was the log-in screen ticket informing people of that? I would've never attempted to enter my garrison if I knew that was going on... <br />
<br />
The problem here is by design, they should know better now than to cramp a whole server into a single zone... and also, they have a problem of comunication, not everyone is following what they say on twitter, and they have the log-in stickys for a reason!</div></div><hr />

Quite right and I am sorry, but I cannot believe nobody in Blizzard did a quest lines analysis. Most of us knew from beta where the nodes where, it was also obvious that people would be waiting in front of the portal, it was also obvious that tons of people would want (and will want!), to stay at garrisons for a long time, it is also obvious that putting quest givers or quest objects in certain position/places/objects will always be a problem. Overall, and after so many months in beta, and given the experience that Blizzard staff should have , I am giving them a 3/10 for this release :(</div></div><hr />

Not planning on quitting WoW but my char been stuck in &quot;Cannot retreive character list&quot; since yesterday evening cause I couldn't stay up for the midnight release, but that's on me...<br />
<br />
Funny thing is that I finally manage to get in today @ 6.30 am EU server time and moments later they had the realm maintainance...<br />
<br />
What to do, what to do... <br />

What will be interesting is how many subs they lose over this.. Having guildies unable to get in due to queue times is getting ridiculous.. Before I was like meh and so on but now after seeing others problems this will be a definite PR nightmare for them and can only imagine the damage control (if any) they are doing to fix what they created..</div></div><hr />

Every single time there's an Expansion Blizz talk about &quot;unexpected&quot; side effects, how can it be unexpected, they know how many people play WOW, they know how many have purchased WoD... very frustrating.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baneleaf</div><div class="date">2014-11-14, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So here is my story. On Beta I was able to get to the same point my character is at in approximately 3 hours, even with realm restarts. We are now 27 hours after launch and I took time off work to get to the same point. That is 24 hours of frustration, cursing, and finally saying F it and getting some sleep. I did reactivate my second account for a month and used a 90 on that account to get on a low pop realm for about and hour but when I hit 91 and disconnected I lost that trick. I am beyond frustrated by this mess. I had limited time to get the whole race to 100 done and the weekend will be quite busy. MoP release was no where near this nor was Cata or Wrath (I missed BC launch night but I heard it was crazy on my old server because of pvp). These releases saw a split in player concentration between starting zones as well as the DK, worgen, goblin, and panda starting areas. We have seen server instability because of server events like raids on main cities or other concentrated events and now we have over 24 hours of nearly unplayable game time on busy servers because of &quot;unforseen player concentration and latency&quot; which is bull. I work for a communications company and we would have lost every customer we have and had my entire IT team fired for 1/10th of this screw up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The unexpected part is the effect that the concentration has had on the realm stability, not the concentration of players itself. Since this is a launch and they've done this before, I'm willing to bet they knew what they were in for. However, it would appear something else went wrong, hence the wording of that quote. Come on, people!<br />
<br />
This is why I don't take days off of work to play at launch. I learned this in 2008.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormgust</div><div class="date">2014-11-14, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt that it's about players concentrating in certain areas. MoP had a more linear layout, i.e. more players concentrating on significantly less space, yet it was much smoother and if at all, only the alliance intro had an impact on realm performance (locally - once yo were out of the intro, almost no performance problems).<br />
<br />
If I'd have to bet, I'd say it's the realms unable to cope with the additional load generated by garrisons.</div></div><hr />

This game has been a blast. Even on my rogue, arguably one of my lower geared toons, I feel engaged, powerful, the Garrison is intuitive, remarkably easy to use, I LOVE THE FEY DRAGON FLIGHT PATHS, rare tagging works how you'd want it to (no need for a group for some things), and the rare/epic drop system is great, and even works for followers. So far I'd give it an 8/10, and thats with the transfer aborted bug I saw last night for an hour, but otherwise I haven't been so heavily impacted by all this &quot;nonsense&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll agree, the whole process is a little mundane for those in full heroic SoO gear right now. You probably don't expect an upgrade to your gear for your toon till 96-97. And you know what? That's totally normal, because this game isn't designed for the 10-15% of people that were in nearly maxed end-game gear. There was a 90 boost that came with it! <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard designed this expansion to bring in new players.... Oh wait, that's every expansion. Stop complaining about launch day, it's getting old. Like 6 years too old. Y'all motherfuckers need Green Jesus.</div></div><hr />

Lots of players are stuck at the garrison and not able to do anything else. Not even logout or quit the game. Only alt-f4 works.</div></div><hr />

At this point, it should not only be expected it should be guaranteed and it should be planned for. My anger comes because they failed to plan for things that they should have known would happen and now they have the gall to say they were &quot;unexpected.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hell, they even knew it would happen and planned for it in WotLK (which was a lot more smooth). That is why there were two starting zones.<br />
<br />
Also, this whole thing is made 100x worse by the way quests currently work. Because quest mobs are not shared loot (unless they are unique quest mobs) it means that people are fighting for quest mobs which mean more have to spawn which means the system is working harder. That was a design decision considering they obviously have the power to make creatures shared loot. Then you add in things like taking 6 seconds to harvest a quest item and you concentrate the zones even more because people are staying in one place for longer.<br />
<br />
The entire design was just horrible and they should have known that after 10 years.</div></div><hr />

Personally, they have until the 18th to get me hooked.

Blizzard completely launched an ill-planned expansion. In the past, there has always been multiple things to do the first day. You could roll a fresh new race, roll a fresh new class, start a new profession, enjoy some new lower level dungeons, explore new low level zones, or choose which new high level starting area you want to go to. Now there is none of that. Blizzard did not give players any choices. On top of that, many servers are heavily imbalanced regarding faction. Therefore, on launch, you have a ton of people doing the exact same thing which destroys load balancing on the servers they are unwilling to upgrade just to cover the first week of the new expansion. It should be no surprise to anyone that works in IT that this expansion is a flop from a launch perspective.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly how I feel about the add on. And some of the treasures are not easy to find. Sometimes you have to look up and around to see it, especially with the outline mode (I disabled it so I can see sparkles instead... Much easier to find that way). Sometimes it is under a cave and I have to circle all around that area until I see the cave entrance and go in it but nope... That wasn't the one. Try the next one. It is actually more fun for me this way. I don't know... Maybe I am having fun wrong, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
launches (this is my 4th) are always crazy the first couple days ... and I cut Bliz some slack for performance issues. But I gotta seriously question the design of some of the early quests. At some point someone has to say &quot;well thats a cool quest and all, and I see how it helps tell the story , but at launch this is gonna be f*ckin crazy ... maybe we ought to tweak it. <br />
<br />
more and more I see what amounts to either laziness or incompetence. Bliz just isn't testing stuff it seems ... no attention to detail. Their attitude seems to be &quot;just ship it and we will spend a couple weeks fixing all the problems&quot;.</div></div><hr />

expected it but when they say they figured out the bottleneck at opening of Blizzcon from when the gates opened i also assumed (and i know i should never assume where blizz is concerned) that they knew what to do this time so these issues were not going to occur but yes i always expect it, hence just going to work and not taking days off to enjoy the opening</div></div><hr />

The other thing was that the opening was not as epic as it could have been.. I missed the TBC one, I enjoyed the WoTLK one simply because they had a lot of things going like an extra boss in Kara that dropped the Arcanite Ripper that turned you into Bergrisst of The Tauren Chieftains and doing a sweet guitar solo and many other things about that event.. Cant remember the Cata one.. lol And well the MoP one well what can one say can't remember that one either.. lol</div></div><hr />

Right, thing is, Bli$$ard has plenty of time and money to get this right, and the fact that they admitted they messed up with the instances server and not expecting to be where they were going to be at in the world (omfg you mean they actually go to the Garrisons?!) they should have seen that coming.

I mean if you take away the lag, this truly looks like it's going to be a phenomenal expansion and I can't wait to level up my next alt now that I finally pushed my first to 100 (took me 20+ hours cause of lag). The zones are fantastic and unique, garrisons are a tonne of fun, Ashran looks to be great - I can't comment on the raids as I haven't really looked into them much tbh as I stopped raiding mid MoP, but there looks like there's going to be TONNES of stuff in the world to do.<br />
<br />
I'm just amazed at how awesome this continent is, I leveled as horde on the beta and I played ally on live and when I hit 100 I was just so excited when I realized that I still had frostfire ridge to go to, we haven't had a complete snowy zone since wotlk and it's just amazing how unique and gorgeous every zone is in it's own way. SMV/Taldor are beautiful, Gorgrond has this great prehistoric feel to it and even the top half that's basically a barren is incredibly pleasing to the eye, Spires of Arak is incredibly ominous and sets this vibe we've never really had in WoW before; especially the veil of terrokk, quite possibly my favorite area in WoW, those dark woods are just so awesome (especially at night time); The whole zone looks quite dark at night and it was a pleasure to quest there even with the 20 second or so delay to cast spells lol (a little exaggerated, more like 8 seconds). Frostfire ridge is a hostile snowy volcanic landscape that you'd expect to be quite boring but is actually one of my favorite zones, this huge open area with wolves howling in the background and the wind blowing in your face is just gorgeous, I love every bit of it and I can't wait to go there on my ally once I get past this ridiculous queue (Also i've been craving for a snowy zone like this for a LONG time). Nagrand has to be the most surprising zone as it's so similar to the original yet it feels so unbelievably fresh, I can't believe how well a job they've done with making this zone feel so new and exciting when it's in essence, the same as the last nagrand except with canyons, occasional forests and no floating islands. And we haven't even seen Tannan yet! (Which was actually the zone I was most excited about when they first announced it)<br />
<br />
The questing is phenomenal, Garrisons are a TONNE of fun, there's so much flexibility with it and the fact that you can collect nodes/herbs from inside every day and even level up the amount that you can get just adds so much more fun interaction with it, i'm so excited to level it up to 3, get the most out of it and get my alts in there as well; And I've only played the ally version! I love the horde one too, sure it's not as pretty but the atmosphere of the zone really adds to it, not to mention the small cave they get where you can do your fishing etc truly is eye candy and I can see myself spending a lot of time just running around my Garrison simply looking at stuff.<br />
<br />
The lag has been horrendous, absolutely horrendous - But I guarantee that once it passes and everything settles down, this is going to be an expansion worth remembering far into the future.</div></div><hr />

They figured two starting zones would alleviate the stress. They just forgot that on most servers 90% of the population is on one faction.</div></div><hr />

You can't do that. I doubt there is a company that supplies such a service, considering some software Blizzard code themselves will be made for specific hardware, and wont be multi platform, and servers cost an absolute bomb.

Really? you want people fired because you cant get into a fucking game? please tell me more about how you are self entitled. <br />
<br />
besides the fact thats not how it works at all. Look at the servers, plenty of them are up, and you can log into them. Nobody is on them, but you can get in them. More servers or bandwidth will not help you there. You, are an imbecile. Crawl off your high horse and get an education.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, we want a company that provides paid service to take financial losses because said service wasn't provided. And yes I know this won't happen with blizz, sadly.<br />
<br />
Second, wherever the problem is with bandwidth or not, there are definitely untested and not-market-ready technical solutions being put into production. There are always people responsible. They should take financial losses as well - maybe even fired, depending on the magnitude of their fuckup in decision making.<br />

Yes you can rent dynamic bandwidth. Any major ISP and their mom provide that option. Most of the time you don't even have to do anything specific technically e.g. you pay for this 15 GBps consolidated channel as usual, but in case demand occurs, you'd pay something extra for bandwidth above those 15GBps.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, go ahead and find me a source for that. It sounds to me like you're just making bold assertions so as to guilt us into not being pissed off. We're all paying customers and it is inexcusable that an international company with the financial/technological resources that Blizzard has, has been completely inept at handling this situation. Most people can totally understand that no MMO launch is flawless. This is the 4th expac I've had been lucky enough to watch launch and I survived FFXIV:ARR's abomination of a relaunch and Wildstar's rocky beginnings, so believe me when I say I have a lot of patience and understanding for tech limitations. This launch has vastly tried and nearly exhausted my patience with the bugs, the latency, the garrisons not working at launch, and now the infinite queue times. It is unreasonable of you to expect customers to not be pissed off when they are unable to use the service they paid for.</div></div><hr />

What exactly is a new tech? Garrisons? You realize that your garrison is, in essence, just another instance in the game? And they had instances...since vanilla! Then what else is a new tech? Phasing into the garrison within a zone? Well, FYI, phasing was implemented in LK - that is 3 expansions and like 6 years ago. Not a new tech definitely.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is facing the SAME problem they had all the time, and that problem originates from poor game architecture (or should I say absence of): if there are too many people in the same place, game lags and crashes. And for blizzard too many means just 30-40 or so. In 2014. Yeah right.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if they had put a little more effort into designing the game for the last year it would be working better and they wouldn't have such an urgent need to fix it. does anyone actually believe that a DDOS attack is anything but an excuse?</div></div><hr />

Before I was like meh and so on but now after seeing others problems this will be a definite PR nightmare for them and can only imagine the damage control (if any) they are doing to fix what they created..<br />
<br />
well they for sure are loosing my sub for few weeks :) luckily my sub runs out in 6 days so im taking 3-4 week break from wow till it stabilizes (especially that christmas break is coming so ques gonan sky rocket again) - no point to waste nerves - gonna push as much as i can in those 6 days probably gonna get to 100 and hc dungeon geared with operational garrison on main will be ust what im gonna need when ill come back in few weeks :)<br />
<br />
and about phasing - its clearly not working- why not make simple thing to counter it - take phasing out put in portal to garrison at gate leave 1 garrison as model out possible give those gates to all outposts instead stupid heartstone - then there will be 4-5 entry points intead 1 fucked up - why peopel have to overcomplicate things jeez :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I make big software. I can tell you this game has SERIOUS architectural flaws. Replacing old server with new one has nothing to do with it; software stays the same. But client-server design that fails and/or becomes laggy with 30-40 players in the same place is a big fault.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paying money to transfer off of a packed server is essentially rewarding them for being this inept. I feel your pain though, dude. I transfered off of Sargeras (US) and faction changed a couple weeks before launch precisely to avoid this problem and still got fucked. Spending your money will only put you in a queue on a different server at this point.</div></div><hr />

They are busting their asses right now trying to fight of those fucking DDOS attacks. And you are all bitching cuz you cant log in. They will get to it. I personally would like to thank them for working as hard as they are so we can get back in.<br />

I like you</div></div><hr />

1. how do you know this?<br />
<br />
2. if they had done their job properly then they wouldn't have had to stay for three days straight, as you claim</div></div><hr />

You are so right, and I know some Blizzard employees they don't work as hard as farmers or other real workers on weekends ...</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more. Business should always prepare for the worst even though things are going smoothly before launch. They have known for years that the first days of a game release as big as this always come with all sorts of issues.</div></div><hr />

This should have been fixed by now, the ONE thing they did that is noticeable is to increase queue times...in-game the same areas are still as fucked as before.</div></div><hr />

11:03- All realms are now live. We'll continue keeping a close eye on performance and see you in game!<br />

They forgot to add /End Sarcasm..<br />

Logged on at what is 8am on Oceanic server.. Nearly 2k people in the queue. Two hours later, 700 still in queue and estimated wait time is between 2 and 3 hours.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the queue is now classified as &quot;in game&quot;....</div></div><hr />

You don't need HandyNotes, MRF has multilanguage support and the treasures are sooo incomplete that I prefer to buy the Blizzard Maps in Ashran anyway.</div></div><hr />

See you in the queue he means, over 2000 people in queue at 1:50 in the night here and I have never seen a queue on that server before in my 9 years on that server.<br />
I dont even want to try waiting for it, the queue at peak time with 4-5k people in it is at least 4 hours long!! The evening is over before I can even start playing, this is an absolute disgrace.<br />
I paid €45 plus €12 subscription to play this game and Im just not able to because Blizzard doesnt get their act together.</div></div><hr />

I get the DDOSing but maybe some serious credits should be issues for game time lost ? Its really only fair.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buffbringer</div><div class="date">2014-11-15, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol and on top of all the waiting (i'm currently on the fifth hour of my queue since i got home from work), they're going into a &quot;scheduled&quot; maintenance tomorrow. A SIX HOURS maintenance.<br />
While it'll be &quot;bedtime&quot; for you guys in North America and you essentially won't lose play time, here in Brazil it means a 9AM-3PM maintenance. Basically, we'll lose half a day of playing this stupid expansion.<br />
To summarize my experience so far:<br />
Thursday: got home from work 6PM, waited on a 3 hour queue, played a laggy, buggy game from 9PM to 11PM, then went to bed.<br />
Friday: got home from work 6PM, waited on a 5 and a half hour queue, currently playing a kinda laggy, buggy game. It's 10:50PM, and i'll play until 12:30AM.<br />
Saturday (how it's gonna be): wake up 8AM, TRY to play a little before the maintenance (if there's no queue, which i doubt). Realms go down until 3PM. Then, 4PM i have a friend's wedding party to go, and won't be back until around 10PM. I'll probably go to sleep then. Which leaves sunday as the only day i'll be able to play the game since its launch, that is if they fix things.<br />
<br />
Gotta say... this is the most frustrating expansion launch so far.</div></div><hr />

Collision geometry has been added to Drek'Thar, Thrall, and Gazlowe in Frostfire Ridge.<br />

Sorry if it is a dumb question, but I haven't a damned clue and Google didn't seem to bring up anything relevant to a video game.</div></div><hr />

Early beta was fine when they started sending out more invites the &quot;issues&quot; people are seeing were present months ago.<br />
some people could access Garrisons and just get playing the Game whilst other never got Garrisons working. lost Characters for weeks got stuck on mounts and severe lag in the new zones. One day we all decided to submit tickets and posts on the EU fourm with Screen shots what was going on not one blue reply so we tried again and the same the thread just trailed down the forum. <br />
<br />
Even totally dead servers in the EU that were dead in MOP and Cata are now locked and again in game some people can access Garrisons no problem whilst others are waiting hours to log on then being excluded outside the Garrisons. the very least someone within Blizzard needs to review what the hell is going on within the WOW department these issues were identified as part of the beta Stress tests so why didn't they act on them ?</div></div><hr />
