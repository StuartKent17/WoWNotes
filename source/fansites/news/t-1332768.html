Hearthstone Beta Now Live!<br />
If you are interested in the basics, there is a nice post on the HearthPwn forums here (http://www.hearthpwn.com/forums/hearthstone-general/general-discussion/371-hearthstone-101). You can also discuss things in our Hearthstone forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/344-Hearthstone-Heroes-of-Warcraft-Online-Cardgame).<br />

<br />
Here’s a card we’ve been dying to play: The closed beta test for Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft has begun in the Americas region!<br />
<br />
During the closed beta test, we’ll be inviting a range of duelers from our opt-in pool (along with folks from press and fansites) to try their hand at Hearthstone and let us know what they think. There’s no NDA during the beta, and we’d love to hear all about your epic victories, watch your live streamed matches, and see screenshots and videos sharing your experiences with the game. Please note that Hearthstone is still in development, and what you see and play in the beta test isn’t necessarily representative of what to expect in the final game.<br />
<br />
Want to participate in beta testing Hearthstone? Read on!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/thumb/hsb01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/hsb01.jpg) <br />
<br />
How do I opt in to the closed beta test?<br />
Once you’ve set up a Battle.net account, you can choose to opt in to our beta test from the Beta Profile page. You’ll need to download and run the System Check tool to attach your computer’s specifications to your beta profile. Once that’s complete it’s simply a matter of waiting for an invite.<br />
<br />
You can also opt in through our website here (https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html?hearthstone).<br />
<br />
How do I know if I’m selected?<br />
We’ll send you an email letting you know if you’re selected. The email will contain a beta key—just follow the instructions inside to get started.<br />
<br />
As always, please be aware of phishing attempts—falsified emails sent by unscrupulous individuals purporting to be from Blizzard, but their real goal is to steal your login credentials. For more information on how to identify these emails, please refer to our Battle.net Security site (http://us.battle.net/security).<br />
<br />
One easy way to ensure your invite is legit is to avoid clicking on links in any invite emails you receive. Instead, just log in to your Battle.net account and add the beta key from your invite email to your account.<br />
<br />
How many players do you plan on inviting to the beta test?<br />
The number of players we invite to the Hearthstone beta will be based on our testing needs. During the course of testing we’ll be inviting additional opt-ins as necessary in waves.<br />
<br />
Is there an NDA?<br />
There is no NDA for the Hearthstone beta test. Take screenshots, live-stream matches, record movies—whatever your heart desires! Please keep in mind that the game is still a work in progress, and we appreciate your understanding when you encounter bugs, graphical errors, or other issues. Help us create a better game for everyone to enjoy by reporting them here (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/10591462/)!<br />
<br />
How long will the beta test last?<br />
We have not determined an exact date for the end of the beta test. We’ll post a notice when the beta test is nearing completion.<br />
<br />
Do I get to keep all my beta cards?<br />
We are planning to wipe all player collections partway through the closed beta. We anticipate needing to rebalance some cards based on the feedback we get in the closed beta, and recognize that players may have made decisions on which cards to disenchant or craft based on information that’s changing. After we’ve completed that wave of balance testing and wiped cards, we do not anticipate needing to reset collections again.<br />
<br />
Players who purchased card packs or Arena entry with real money prior to the collection wipe will be credited back with an equivalent amount of gold following the wipe, which can be used to re-purchase packs and/or Arena entry to re-establish their collection. These packs will not contain the same configuration of cards as the packs acquired previous to the collection reset.<br />

<br />
I know hearthstone is different than the real wow tcg but i just cant shake the feeling of smiliarities, its like playing wow tcg online, granted its a different game, but the core concept is just taken to an online game mode/world and improved upon. <br />
<br />
Hex is a brand new game/world and sets itself apart from wow or warcraft, because most of us have done all the wow and warcraft stuff, at least with hex its not more of the same from an already exsisting franchise (warcraft). But then again hearthstone will benefit greatly being from an already familiar/loved franchise, characters and cards from warcraft/wow etc so i guess we will see<br />

<br />
Even if Hex ends up being way better, with Blizzard's new launcher and how easily they can advertise Hearthstone will most likely be the more popular game assuming it doesn't end up being really bad (which it shouldn't)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think we get the worst service. There are Australians and South Africans (hi my bokkies) and others that have a far worse experience in general with Blizzard games. Which is unfortunate. What still sucks is that there are too many realms (and it's laughable by now) that exist for current sub numbers (minus the sneaky sub cards from Asia) and no answer other than realm merging which we now find out doesn't really affect a high pop realm that might be quite lopsided. This is quite baffling.<br />
<br />
hey I'm waffling! Let's stop that right now.<br />
<br />
Stop whining about no demo for Europe, it's coming. :)<br />

I am actually really interested in this and I would seriously get it and play it besides WoW. <br />
Oh and to it would be nice if WoW can actually have something to in like a mini-game board based on it like you can do for pet battles and I hope Blizzard does something like it to. LOL...</div></div><hr />

Yes it is, they already stated that the promotion part is you buying decks during beta... you will get refunded on launch but u get the achie for doing it</div></div><hr />

There are Australians and South Africans (hi my bokkies) and others that have a far worse experience in general with Blizzard games. Which is unfortunate. What still sucks is that there are too many realms (and it's laughable by now) that exist for current sub numbers (minus the sneaky sub cards from Asia) and no answer other than realm merging which we now find out doesn't really affect a high pop realm that might be quite lopsided. This is quite baffling.<br />
<br />
hey I'm waffling! Let's stop that right now.<br />
<br />
Stop whining about no demo for Europe, it's coming. :)<br />
<br />
But not to you or I (statistically).<br />
I like how you took someone basically complaining about no EU beta and made it a complaint about low population servers...<br />
<br />
Also, Beta is not a demo.<br />
<br />
Anyways, even if you don't get into the Closed Beta, there is going to be an Open Beta so everyone will get to play. Hell, it's F2P so everyone can eventually play anyway.</div></div><hr />

If news were slower I definitely would have done a decent bit on EQNext at the end of a post. As it is now I may have to break the only 6 days a week of news unwritten rule and do a news post today just to keep up. :(<br />
<br />
Maybe when it gets closer to beta!</div></div><hr />

agreed, I don't plan on playing the elder scrolls mmo, but I hope and think it has a great chance to be a successful mmo! I'd love to see some more news dedicated to it! Would love to see more people hear about it and for it to take off, but sadly, Hearthstone is more important as it's made by blizzard.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see a game like elder scrolls online get some news coverage vs a card game. Why is blizzard even hopping on that bandwagon? Aren't card games so early 2000s?<br />
<br />
With that said, Hearthstone DOES look good for what it is!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why Would I be even remotely interested in this?<br />
I don't give a rats ass about some cardgame. Unless they add the cardgame to WOW, Rift, Aion, Lotro, Swtor or any other MMO game<br />
<br />
Would it be too much to ask if you make a www.tcg-Champion.com for matters conserning Hearthstone, Magic The Gathering, Sanctum etc.<br />
Please keep MMO-Champion for MMO stuff.</div></div><hr />

Step one: Your opinion doesn't equal fact.<br />
<br />
Step two: It's pathetic for people involved in games to put up ranks such as you have for what can be considered &quot;nerdy&quot; and not. <br />
<br />
Yes, people no doubt want to play this game, you don't HAVE to but of course you need to moan about it all the same because of boredom of whatever it is that you suffer from. <br />
<br />
This game doesn't take resources from WoW, there's ALWAYS room for more games no matter what self-absorbed kids think about it and the best part of it all is that what you don't want to play, someone else can still enjoy!<br />
<br />
Seriously, I don't wanna live on this planet with all of this stupidity and selfishness going on...&quot;I don't like it, it shouldn't exist!!!&quot;...NEVER reproduce, please. This goes for everyone of the same attitude in this thread. And as for people wanting mmo-news...then go find it? This website isn't yours to decide over...</div></div><hr />
