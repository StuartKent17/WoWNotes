The tokens purchased with Echoes of Battle, gained by obliterating Gladiator gear, now create an item at item level 880 (was 865).<br />

Ehhh, since when reading something that is relevant to the reader and prompts the reader to comment on that something is considered having an 'attitude'. <br />
That nerf is simply unecessary, and was surely 'forced' by threads that emerged 5 mins after the tower went live that had the word OVERTUNNED all over them. I get it that eveyone wants the skin - some of them are really badass - but it is not supposed to be available to everyone - not now at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also can't understand people crying to nerf other classes but not theirs - just for the sake to feel better that other got hit - these are kindergarten tactics - so low. Others crying for buffs because their class doing so bad - don't simply play your class master your class - that's the difference - not the bad performance of the class - it's mostly the bad performance of the guy/gal pressing the buttons.</div></div><hr />

I suppose I'm biased since I play it, but how have we still not heard ANYTHING about enhance? It's in a terrible spot and yall are buffing classes that are already at the top? I'm going to assume that blizzard isn't just throwing darts at a board with abilities to buff and nerf and say this is in preparation for 7.2.5, because in no way do these hotfixes make sense right now. I mean, SERIOUSLY, enhances TCs have given ridiculously amazing feedback about spec issues and community concerns, and we haven't even gotten a &quot;we're aware of the problem. thanks for the feedback&quot;.

<br />
No they want to drive everyone playing ranged hunters into Survival so their fucking internal metrics will show that it wasn't a total waste of resources and a complete fuck you to what was the most played class in the game. I guess when they've driven away the 25% of players who liked hunters in the past then they'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, somethg around .4 / .5 %<br />
It buffs ST burst damages.<br />
<br />
I feel like they did it because other traits were more valuable than this golden trait.<br />
It is true that traits increasing damages of ice lance, flurry, proc rate of flurry and reduction of IV CD are very powerfull atm.<br />
Every single dps trait of the frost weapon gives around 1.5 to 2% dps increase, which is just a LOT more than any trait of the fire weapon. <br />
<br />
If things stay the same, i think spending AP on felo melorn is a total waste of time atm.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
i do not really understand what they are doing with frost vs fire anyway.<br />
with the trait freezing rain, frost can even compete with sustained aoe damages quite well.</div></div><hr />

That nerf is simply unecessary, and was surely 'forced' by threads that emerged 5 mins after the tower went live that had the word OVERTUNNED all over them. I get it that eveyone wants the skin - some of them are really badass - but it is not supposed to be available to everyone - not now at least.<br />
<br />
You were name calling, in your very first post ever on this forum, doesn't exactly put you in a great light. It's not constructive and it's a toxic attitude.<br />
<br />
As for the nerf, the tank challenge is way more difficult than the dps challenges so nerfing it to be more on par with the rest is warranted.</div></div><hr />

Weird how you think buffing Oathblood, an artifact trait that might proc 3 times in an entire fight 5 minute fight is really all that much of a buff. Now it'll proc 4-5 times in a 5 minute fight, if we're lucky.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with them nerfing hunters but the oathblood trait was basically broken with how little it proc'd. There was literally no point to it existing (and it's still a mediocre trait at best).<br />
<br />
On my last Elisande kill (before the hotfix) it actually proced less than it's stated 10%.</div></div><hr />

It's the image it's projecting. Kinda like a bad PR move. I get the changes aren't really anything special, but it makes them look detached.<br />
<br />
Hunters, on the other hand, are so fucked. It's really sad to see the state they're in.</div></div><hr />
