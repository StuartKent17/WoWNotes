Get Murgle the Red Murloc Plush and Mug July 9!<br />
The Queen of Tides has returned with Rise of Azshara (https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/23014432/), bringing a ton of new experiences to encounter—including many rare creatures—in Battle for Azeroth. One such creature is the elusive rare red baby murloc pet, Murgle. You can find Murgle in Nazjatar’s Bloodfin Village, but you’ll need to summon and defeat King Gakula first. Stirring up a little trouble with the village tadpoles is sure to draw him out.<br />

You mean like naga commanders that spawn every 3 hours and die in less than 30 seconds? Or the pvp event that won't happen anymore because Blizzard won't fix sharding?</div></div><hr />

I have limited time to play WoW nowadays, because of two kids. Yes, that was my own choice. But it also means I have to prioritize what &quot;spend my time on&quot; in-game. I'm picking the lowest hanging fruit, and mostly don't have that much to read up on &quot;what I can do&quot; - IMO it should be intuitive whilst playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even without the time argument, I agree on this. If you don't go to external sites to discover things, it looks like there's not much to do.</div></div><hr />
