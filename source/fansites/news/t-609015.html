<br />
<br />
Hellgate: London isn't owned by Blizzard. D3 is. Although it may be Diablo 3, it's not Diablo 3. Personally I'd consider Mythos to be D3, if anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Diablo3.com and related urls have been registered to blizzard for a good while now, <br />
it's only a matter of time obviously, but i don't think this will be d3 just yet.<br />
You'll probably want to register diablo4.com if you want to make a quick buck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit:<br />
If you look at the image URLs, such as the ice background, it says ice1.jpg, or that other weird picture, 04.jpg. I've checked out several increments of those numbers, but there's nothing. I do think we will see those images up later this week though, as in the ice melting away or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's encouragement for it to never come out, you realize, since it would represent a loss of ongoing income for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Still, just actually look at that ice-crystal blue splash screen and tell me it has anything to do with D3… I think announcement of a WotLK beta period is far more likely! Many things have been hinting recently that WotLK is closer than we might have thought. The presence of construction on the Stormwind Harbor in 2.4.3 PTR, for example.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxinusom</div><div class="date">2008-06-23, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Compare with the ice in http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/<br />
<br />
Looks extremely similar. So it's most likely WotlK related. Personally I'd expect a start of beta-test date or something like that or failing that, more up to now unreleased information about WotlK. But no other game. Blizzcon is going to take place in October, they'll probably do release new game information then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look in the .css file, or view the image above you can see the word tundra (Borean Tundra (http://www.wowwiki.com/Borean_Tundra)) home of the Tuskarr and the landscape is all ice and snow, referring now to the splash page. If you view the image on the same line, http://us.media.blizzard.com/232309/_images/04.jpg then it could be a tuskarr in that picture.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm telling you, if I get a beta key in my goodie bag I'll go CRAZY of happyness.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://eu.blizzard.com/wwi08/goodybag.xml - According to that page you will be getting a beta key, so its bound to be between starcraft 2 (announced in may '07) or WotLK (announced in august '07)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iczer</div><div class="date">2008-06-23, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">uh, lol @ all the wotlk comments? why would they make such a big deal about it going into beta? iirc, they didn't with tbc. my guess goes to d3. i'm assuming the graphic will change over the days like sc2 did, so i'm expecting the ice to gradually melt away to reveal a gateway to hell or something like that. also, in last months pc gamer, the blurb for next months issue was about an announcement of a huge game, and a quote from it is &quot;this news is so big, we had to go to ***** to get it&quot; aka &quot;... we had to go to hell to get it&quot;. inc d3.<br />
<br />
edit: also, ice would be way too obvious for wotlk, i mean come on... blizz is a lot more creative than that. they probably wanted everyone to think it was something wotlk-related so it would be more of a surprise in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously I vote Lich King release date or more likely release month maybe not an exact date. Although I like the idea that Iczer posted about the ice melting away and revealling Diablo 3 would be a a ncie touch and fairly plausable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devenu</div><div class="date">2008-06-23, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably the release of the cinematic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vakir</div><div class="date">2008-06-23, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's also important to note that releasing Diablo 3 info this soon may be a bad business move. Not because &quot;LOL EVERYONE WILL CANCEL ACCOUNTS.&quot; That's stupid noise, people say that everytime a nerf happens. I just think with all the press crap they're going to be flinging around with WLK and all the marketing efforts and focus they'll need to put on hyping it, I doubt they'd release information for yet another MMO. Diablo 3 seems sort of reserved for the half-way point of an expansion's life so people can get hyped while the less serious players are already suffering burnout, in order to not detract from a new product's value. I can't see it happening hot on the heels of another expansion for Blizzard's biggest I.P.</div></div><hr />

Honestly though, who knows. But I don't think just because it says Tundra that it's the Borrean (sp) Tundra.</div></div><hr />

I think everyone here would happy with D3. It's just weird timing.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard is not known for subtlety. They've personally attested to that in their art department. The hieroglyphics (Egyptian-like? As opposed to the other kind of hieroglyphics?) are very difficult to make out. To me they look like white scratches. Look around the areas that don't look like hieroglyphs and you'll see less patterned white streaks of the same shade. That may change as the ice diminishes/whatever the hell is going to happen to it. Off to the left, that weird runic/circle pattern design seems to be stroked the same way Wei's signature is in the Arthas pic on the WLK main site.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think logically. Why would Blizzard in the past week:<br />
<br />
-take over the Diablo3.com name<br />
-stop the redirection from Diablo3.com to Diablofans.com <br />
-reset the Diablo 2 ladder<br />

<br />
<br />
They've taken over the Diablo3.com name several times, once even around the time Starcraft 2 was going to be announced around the same time period, and had pulled it from fan-sites then as well. Resetting the ladder and patch related to a game that isn't due for at least a year if it's announced doesn't really work out logically here either.<br />
<br />
Also, 04.jpg doesn't look Diablo related in the least. It's way too cartoony. Granted, the lower left corner may be a head, and looks vaguely demonic, but it's purpleish, almost cute, and appears to have fur along its back.<br />
<br />
To jump to conclusions this quickly on just a bunch of ice with difficult to discern markings probably isn't a good idea. That said, it's your choice. :) I just don't like it when people jump to conclusions only to get let down (like people claiming the real Brawl roster was a fraud).<br />
<br />
Man, I have nothing better to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember a little interesting place in Diablo 2 called the Frozen Tundra?<br />

If they debut Diablo 3 with a reworked old area in addition to a similar theme already coming in their current expansion, Blizzard is officially stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why the speculation and anticipation though? They would NOT tease a cinematic trailer for a damn game, are you kidding me? They wouldn't even tease a beta test or release date. They NEVER have in the past, not once. <br />
<br />
If it were the CG trailer, they would come out and say it. &quot;Tune into WWI for a first look at the opening CG cinematic for Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, or better yet, do it at another venue ala the Spike Awards for Burning Crusade (which was OPENLY PUBLICIZED). Why would they manipulate their website for crap like that?<br />
<br />

I'm actually not so sure now. The announcement, according to PC Gamer, is way bigger than that. &quot;We had to go to [CENSORED] to get it,&quot; like the other guy said.<br />

No, it just blows my mind that people will speculate it has something to do with their franchise of choice without reason or logic. I atleast backed up my opinions and speculation, not solely because I'm a Diablo fan.</div></div><hr />

No one here stated that it was their franchise of choice.<br />

I'm not gonna play semantics here. If people are blindly speculating without reason, then I suppose it's their own fault. <br />

Potential red-herring or advertisement of an area that is similar to their game already coming out...the latter of which would be kind of idiotic. We know there's a purple beast creature with hair/fur on its back. Go figure.<br />

Are you just blind and always wishing it was diablo u are the one without any reason or logic! My reason is look at the god damn page is ICE! same ice u can find in the Wotlk page and Yes its a big deal because they put alot of work IN THAT DAMN video and will reveal important story line to the game wtf is going on with Arthas and such...<br />
<br />
You diablo fan is living in a fantasy ALL DIABLO producers and programers AKA Blizzard North has taken off and left blizzard long ago and made another game what makes u think blizzard will push another diablo without any crew from the old diablo games it will only make a shitty game and lose all there diablo fans. would be a stupid move.<br />

PC Gamer employees showed up twice to Blizzard offices. Once was for the WLK preview they put up 2 days ago. Why the second time? <br />
<br />
I'd like to propose that the red could be blood, though. There is blood on the ice on the WLK main site.</div></div><hr />

Not buying that particular link.<br />
<br />
It's easy for someone to say it's censored by the ESA and then link to it. It's another matter entirely to have scripts and such up to prevent that information from being divulged in the first place.<br />

Nevermind that past new Blizzard products have always yielded 403s.<br />

There's a lot of different aspects to that image that are kind of elusive. In order to really say it's a crystal, you probably need to wait to see if anything changes about the ice.<br />
<br />
That said, TFT and WoW were developed simultaniously, but WoW was a much more expansive project. Also, nothing in 04.jpg looks Starcraft related.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We definitely appreciate that the community has a lot of interest in seeing the Diablo series continue, and we certainly share that desire,&quot; Blizzard told Shacknews yesterday. &quot;For now, though, our focus remains on StarCraft II and Wrath of the Lich King.&quot; <br />
<br />
comes from that above article.<br />

2. The use of ice would obviously suggest WotLK. However what is going to happen to the ice over the next few days?<br />

<br />
i. The Lich King's Suit of armor before arthas broke the &quot;icy cask&quot; that contained it. <br />
ii. Arthas himself? Wouldn't seem to make sense as he's not hidden in ice.<br />
iii. Something else under the ice? The runes, the redness could imply that the wait for Diablo 3 is over (hell has frozen over)<br />
<br />
3. The runes on the image are too sketchy, not established enough for Death Knight runes. This would again suggest Diablo.<br />
<br />
4. CSS clues. Hmm, I wouldn't trust these. &quot;Tundra&quot; is &quot;An area where tree growth is hindered by cold temperatures&quot;. The image is ice based and has no trees quite acceptable for a designer to calls the class by a representing name. The other image in the CSS could quite simply be a red herring. There's absolutely no need to have that picture in there so imo it's been put there for people to go &quot;zOMG!&quot;<br />
<br />
To sum it up.. It could be anything. There's nothing to suggest WotLK because it wouldn't make sense to advertise something with enough current hype already existing about it. There's a reasonable emount to suggest the possibility of a Diablo 3 but who knows. Lets just wait till tomorrow and carry on the speculation! :D</div></div><hr />

Publicity. Seriously, you can never have too much of it. I wouldn't hold it past them to advertise it further.<br />

Could be a logo of anything. Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft, NEW FRANCHISE (Perish the thought)?<br />
<br />

<br />
While I also suggested the possibility of a red-herring, at the same time part of me thinks Blizzard isn't really smart enough for that. I mean, jeez, &quot;/wrath&quot; let to a 403. That's a dead freaking give-away. No red herrings there.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm ambivalent again. They denied possibility of it yet again in the above article.<br />
<br />
That said, I don't understand the excitement. The Diablo art design and motifs are wonderful, but with the original team thrown out, it wouldn't really be Diablo beyond the logo on the box and the company. Might as well call it anything.</div></div><hr />

They've already killed the top villains in the game, Arthas is next, and that only leaves Sargeras and the Old Gods, its time they return Warcraft to its roots and continue what they left behind.<br />
<br />
It could be a representation of the Maelstrom for all we know, and something regarding the fact the Naga are melting away the icecaps trying to drown the world, Warcraft IV could be an RTS view of the assault on Northrend, I don't know we'll wait and see.<br />

The color reversed and contrast bumped image from Laser I can trust, but this one looks like someone just pasted the outlining of Diablo 2's box onto this or something. I don't see how the hell half of these marks are there on the actual image, and it doesn't help that the poster didn't explain how the hell he even made this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tufy</div><div class="date">2008-06-23, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Diablo war released in 1996, Starcraft in 1998, Diablo 2 in 2000, Warcraft III in 2002 and World of Warcraft in 2004/2005 (depending on zone). We can conclude from this that Blizzard will first want to release Starcraft II and World of Warcraft expansion before announcing another new project.<br />
<br />
2. If you remember the starcraft announcement, it was a futuristic timeline hinting at SC2. Here we have ice, which obviously hints at Wotlk (all diablo logos so far are fiery).<br />
<br />
3. The Ice on the splash screen bears a striking resemblence to the ice where Lich King has his Frostmourne stuck into on wow-europe.com/wrath; another obvious hint at Wotlk.<br />
<br />
4. If we look at the invitational list, the whole thing seems centered around Wotlk and a bit of SC2 in between. Additionally, a goodie box contains beta key of some sort. Since wotlk is already in F&amp;F phase, with work progressing well, we can expect closed beta soonish.<br />
<br />
Thus, based on available information, the splash screen hints at WotLK announcement of some sorts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The argument here is that the fire behind the ice will melt it away, but then I fail to see why WHITE light is behind it. The only red really comes from certain traces of the &quot;runes&quot; which can just be randomly patterned scratches now that I think of it. The same traces of &quot;runes&quot; are on the ice with Arthas on the main site.<br />
<br />
That said, the same white light behind the ice right now is similar to the kind that shines down when you near Icecrown Citadel in the current F&amp;F Alpha in the Icecrown zone.</div></div><hr />

The PR would simply be insane for the company to handle. Starcraft II is right around the corner (in Blizzard terms) and so is WotLK. That's two games (sorta, ones an expansion of course) that are each part of two of the biggest gaming franchises of all time. For them to then announce a third game again apart of a massive franchise (damn, you can bet your ass other companies wish could say the same) would be a PR nightmare. You'd be hurting all three. Especially considering two of those have very merging audiences.<br />
<br />
It's either WotLK or SC2 related. That's simple, my vote is a official release date or closed beta announcement for one or the other. WWI Paris attendees getting a invite at that (and no, it's not wishful thinking considering I won't be going).</div></div><hr />

There's also a guy with a giant cleft chin to the left if you wanna talk about poorly drawn crap &quot;carved&quot; into the ice, but one can argue that the little outjut to the left is also a horn, and that it's Diablo.<br />

Both are semi-farfetched. I'd wait a few days to see if the ice changes. If we're getting a &quot;hell melts ice over,&quot; we should kind of start seeing some fire or red, and it'll be a dead giveaway fairly quickly.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention Diablo.com redirects to Blizzard and always has. The proper address is blizzard.com/us/diablo which does NOT go to that Splash. Only the Korean WoW sites do.</div></div><hr />

That was there from when the Wrath of the Lich King site first appeared...the ice came off the center banner and was sort of &quot;enveloping&quot; the TBC logo in the upper left. They took down that banner, but never changed the logo. People have been claiming the ice is covering more and more of the logo, but in reality it really hasn't.</div></div><hr />

IMO, that has NOTHING to do with the blurb from last month. I wonder if Blizz came down on them and is making them wait another month on the news, since this month's issue would have hit before WWI.<br />

As for the ice.. sure it looks like Wotlk. But it's Monday guys. That thing is goin to change SO MUCH by Saturday. <br />

Its called matrixing. Connecting the dots to make images after slinging paint on the wall is the same thing. Quit assuming.<br />
<br />
The art is the exact same as wotk to the T probably the same artist even. If it was that big of a release they would NOT be ripping art off an expansion.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking they just took pieces of the ice and rearranged them to make it into a bigger picture. That was one of them.<br />

I could be wrong. <br />

There's also the chance that Project Hydra isn't due out yet, but then why would his site be updated 6/28? Probably will be project Hydra.<br />

only the true white pixels where left, due to the fact that the original image was made in photoshop there are pixels left from a layer that is just faded out.<br />
in this case the text in the middle of that very image.<br />
the filter i used is a gradient spectrographic analyzer, showing hidden pixels or only parts of an image belonging to a specific color (white in this case).<br />

There is not a single true white pixel in that image. Closest you get is R251 G253 B253 and theres only 10 of those in the whole image out of 1000 colors.</div></div><hr />

Looks extremely similar. So it's most likely WotlK related. Personally I'd expect a start of beta-test date or something like that or failing that, more up to now unreleased information about WotlK. But no other game. Blizzcon is going to take place in October, they'll probably do release new game information then.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not beta surely, that's something internal that normals don't care about. Only the full sell date would be interesting.</div></div><hr />

Not really, if its saturday(june28) then letter 0 will be revealed which is still gonna spell Diablo<br />
if its sunday(june29) then 3 is the last one. Diablo 3.<br />

its the same thing with starcraft 2 btw, :p<br />

Well there is no doubt that it is ice and the theme of wotk is ice and the art style is the exact same as all concept and web site art that has been released so far for wotk. If its diablo or not the art we are looking at says wotk all over it.</div></div><hr />

First of all its the first teaser, why would they give it all out ? Also Diablo has ICE as-well people forgot about the expansion. People assume its WOTLK because its ICE, which is *yawn* People also assume the symbol with frostmourne yet forgets the fact that diablo also has the same symbol/rune. And there's always a chance that both wotlk ice and this teaser is made by the same artist, which makes you think they are the same.</div></div><hr />

The only site on the list of that noise that matters is Battle.net. Starcraft 2 doesn't link to it, Starcraft Ghost redirects to Blizzard, so it's just an extra, and Blizzard.co.kr is just...the same damn thing. Europe-WoW and Korea-WoW all have the splash screens, and no other games do. <br />
<br />
I still think it's Diablo 3 at this point, but you're kind of incorrect. It is only showing up on WoW sites.<br />
<br />
It's also worth a note that the WWI suggested 16+ attendees for &quot;some content.&quot;</div></div><hr />

even if thats the case, still doesn't prove anything. I remembered when the teaser from starcraft 2 was only showed in World of warcraft site, what did everyone say ? &quot;omg next wow expansion for sure&quot; look what happened. Starcraft 2.</div></div><hr />

What idiot said it was the next WoW expansion? Everyone said it was Starcraft 2. It was a futuristic looking timeline.<br />
<br />
Here there's reason to be skeptical, albeit I agree with you (albeit I think the way you're presenting it makes you look retarded). Yeah, Diablo has ice, but the ice here is identical to WLK's. That's the only reason people are questioning it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A-lot of people, especially at wow forums, even here and world of raids website, they all wanted new expansion info for wow. When SC2 was announced a-lot wer very happy and a-lot wer also upset, because they thought it was wow expansion.<br />
<br />
We don't know yet, we have to wait for next teaser, its the first teaser, what if blizzard did it on purpose ? which they can as always. Makes me wonder if both the ice from wotlk and that teaser are made from the same artist. Whatever i already showed what i found, its only a matter of time now. Sorry =p</div></div><hr />

Ok. But it does not mean it is Diablo.<br />

It's not Diablo.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna take a wild guess. It's a cartoon of one of the new mobs that can be found in the tundra zone for Wrath of the Lich King. Everyone is aware of the fact that one of the new zones is a tundra, right?<br />
<br />
Also, using logic combined with cynicism, we have that Blizzard would not hype a different product on their WOW sites, unless those products were WOW related. Oh, and let's not forget that the likelihood of Blizzard releasing a game with an icy theme so very close to WOTLK would be marketing suicide, and Blizzard are just too good (at marketing) for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main thing that leads me to think its NOT Diablo 3 is the fact that it would be awful timing. WotLK and SC2 are riding high on hype, add Diablo 3 to the mix and it would not only take away from the hype for the other games but also possibly reduce impact of the announcement. It would make more sense to announce it after the release of one of the current games.<br />

The thing is that SC have very different costumers then WoW and D2.<br />
<br />
Now D2 and WoW share customers, since they both are RPGs, where one is an MMO ofc course. But announcing D3 at this point wouldn't be to stupid, since everyone and their monkey knows it takes a looooooong time for Blizzard to release a game after they announce it.<br />
<br />
So releasing WotLK and SC2, relative close. And announcing D3 in the same year, can you imagine the attention Blizzard would get in the community!? The only thing missing is WC4 and the whole thing would explode.<br />
<br />
Also remember, announcing and releasing have absolute nothing related what so ever, except the game of course :)</div></div><hr />

This picture could very well be a cartoonish drawing of a cow. Maybe over the next few days, they will release other portions of this same pic ultimately putting the pieces together to have a picture of a cow serving beer.</div></div><hr />

Also Diablo has ICE as-well people forgot about the expansion. People assume its WOTLK because its ICE, which is *yawn* People also assume the symbol with frostmourne yet forgets the fact that diablo also has the same symbol/rune. And there's always a chance that both wotlk ice and this teaser is made by the same artist, which makes you think they are the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you think they have only one 2d artist that can only manage one type of ice style? Wake up. It’s a direct rip off of wotlk and they intended it that way. No one knows why yet but they clearly have the talent and money to give the impression they desire.</div></div><hr />

omg there is no refference, people are taking this picture too serious. It is wotlk theme indeed. Wotlk-style ice, and symbol from frosmourne in that circle. We dont know whats going on, but im pretty sure its NOT beta announcement. Most likely release date, or cinematic. Id guess cinematic because ive seen wotlk alpha and its heavy WIP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And also you might notice that this drawing resembles a place, i mean not just a stupid ice. You can see ledges... and i think its a huge cave, because there are rocks... lol<br />

Anyways my speculation is that this is either Gateway either some sort of Seal and something is trying to open it... its defo a great new evil coming out... <br />

Hell yeah, i wana kill some angels and shit like that! <br />

That makes zero sense from any practical stand point. No development company in their right mind would have three different games announced at the same time with two having the same market audience. The splash screen is a major WotLK announcement for WWI Paris. Is a Diablo game in the work? Probably in some form yes but I'm extremely doubtful it's even close enough to alpha to be shown in any form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this picture is extremely familiar and being that I ONLY follow WoW and WotLK (and WAR but its hardly related) I'd put money on a WotLK announcement. I've been trying for a while to find where I saw it before but I haven't had any luck. either way if I was a betting man I'd put all my money on something WotLK-related.</div></div><hr />

This splash site also appears on www.starcraftghost.com Not that that means anything per se...but I just thought I'd throw that out to add to the food for thought already on the plate.....I'm beginning to believe it's D3 as well, guess we'll all just have to wait till the WWI this weekend.<br />

Cheers :)<br />

Most idiotic thing ever, you go to say its on the Starcraft site, then proceed to say its probably D3. Not to sound like a jerk =/</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure it's the same way it's been for MONTHS. It's not 75% now. It's still &quot;50%&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Rune markings? Doesn't match anything on Frostmourne like the other glyph visible. Sure time will tell but it's fun to speculate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Albeit a non-corrupted version.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a hint that he didn't destroy all of it? Or perhaps the kinda scattered jagged pieces are depicting what is left after it was shattered.</div></div><hr />
