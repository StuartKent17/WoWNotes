Mythic+ 20 Darkheart Thicket<br />
Members of Serenity (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/twisting-nether/Serenity) completed a Mythic+ 20 Darkheart Thicket (http://www.wowprogress.com/mythic_plus) run within the time limit! Congratulations to them. <br />

Patch 7.1.5 - Volunteer Guard Day<br />
Volunteer Guard Day (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/635-volunteer-guard-day) allows you to help defend your faction's city and take on the appearance of a guard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Approach any guard in your faction's city and /salute them<br />
<br />
Alliance: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, The Exodar, Stormshield<br />
Horde: Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, Undercity, Silvermoon, or Warspear<br />
<br />
You will take on the appearance of the guard you interacted with, along with a 24H Volunteer City Guard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/231193-volunteer-city-guard) buff.<br />
While you have the buff, City Invaders will spawn when you are in town and attack you. Defeat them to increase your kill count.<br />
 Killing 10 attackers adds the &quot;Defender of X&quot; to your buff, 50 for &quot;Heroic Defender&quot;, and 250 for &quot;Mythic Defender&quot;. This doesn't appear to have any actual effect.<br />
This buff persists through death and changing of zones, but will be lost when entering an instance.<br />
You can get the buff back again by saluting a guard. Losing the buff will not reset your kill counter.<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
probably a silly question. But will my honor talents reset at the end of season? Will I have to grind them again?<br />
Honor talents will not be reset. There will, however, be new Prestige levels to earn! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848099444772864))<br />
<br />
Are the Prestige PvP mounts going away with the season?<br />
Nope! The current Prestige mounts will still be obtainable in Season 2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848400641961984))<br />
<br />
Someone said that in PvP only the first 34 weap ranks unlocked count, not the bonus ranks but don't see that in blue post? T or F?<br />
This is correct. Ranks 35+ do not apply in PvP instances. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848633434214400))<br />
<br />
When you switch factions, is it 50 wins in the bracket you want the title in or 50 wins in either 2v2 3v3 or RBGs<br />
50 wins in the specific bracket. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805848813843857409))<br />
<br />
Will your current prestige rank reset, or will you just continue prestiging the new levels?<br />
Prestige ranks will not reset. If you're already at max Prestige, you'll be able to immediately move on to the new ranks. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/805851612002459648))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Can Fel Magic be used to Heal as well as Corrupt? Like Shivarra Priestesses who Heal?<br />
definitely. If your a fel based creature. Otherwise it's going to leave a mark. (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/804857577183973376))<br />

Death Knights: what makes you feel like a DK? Do you consider yourself kind of evil? Would you raise a soul against its will? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/805228118105436160))<br />
<br />
Priests: how does shadow fit in with the Light for you? Are shadow priests corrupted? What IS discipline? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/805233291557146624))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
How do you think players should provide feedback on games that’s useful for developers? Do you find player change suggestions useful, or should they focus more on explaining their problems instead?<br />
So there is this (somewhat insulting) maxim that gets floated around that players are supposedly great at identifying problems and terrible at suggesting solutions. I don’t like repeating it, because it has this unhelpful implication that players are stupid. <br />
<br />
Players aren’t stupid. They just don’t know the whole code base. I don’t know the whole code base. The tech director probably doesn’t know the whole code base.<br />
<br />
Usually, the actual issue is that in software development, it’s often really hard for people not intimately familiar with a specific part of the code to predict how easy or hard an idea will be to implement. You get better at it of course, but I’ve been doing this for almost 20 years now, and I still get surprised when solution X takes 4 months to implement and nearly-identical solution Y takes 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Players are about as far removed from the code base as one can be, so often the solutions they come up with aren’t feasible, sometimes for very pedantic reasons.<br />
<br />
There are other reasons the suggestion won’t work. Maybe it just feels wildly inconsistent to the rest of the game. Maybe it would cause a lot of bugs. Maybe it would be easy to exploit. Maybe it would cause weird player behavior.<br />
<br />
So, yes, strictly speaking if you want to be as efficient as possible in your feedback, focus on explaining the problem. State the problem very clearly. Don’t assume the reader, even a dev, understands your shorthand. You might end up talking about two totally different things. Then state the consequences for the problem. That’s it. Suggestions on how to fix it are probably most useful as a way for us to reverse engineer what the specific problem is, but again, it’s more efficient just to state that clearly in the first place.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I’ll risk making another sweeping generalization here and opine that player feedback is nearly always too long. There must be this other maxim somewhere that the length of a post is somehow proportional to the strength of the post, but that’s just not true in my experience. Players love bullets. Posts with lots of bullets get upvoted, as if the writer must certainly be an authority on a topic if they can come up with so many things that are busted or so many reasons why something being busted is bad. But longer isn’t automatically better. Longer is automatically less efficient however. You are probably burying your good stuff in a sea of words.<br />
<br />
We are busy. You don’t want to make us digest a wall of text just to distill out the really critical information. You want to write like Hemingway: use just enough words to get your point across, and no more.

Good move. However, the person who wrote the announcement, did they know about Chinese players completing +20 first and still went ahead calling Serenity's run a World First? which follows the past perceptions caused by inflated Chinese ilvl, etc... making their wins sort of irrelevant to some people? Or did the announcer truly not know the Chinese were first?<br />
<br />
I ask because if it's the latter, and the announcer was simply oblivious, then it's fine. Honest mistake. But if he/she knew, then this really needs to stop :D China lost their competitive advantage ways back and it made them equal to all others in the race. So when is the website going to acknowledge their wins n stuff? There are so many Chinese people in the world and we can't act like they don't exist...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, whenever someone is attacking me(as a shadow I'm pretty much free loot) there or trying to ram me....it's &quot;off to the drake&quot;....you just don't want to have a dot-spamming shadow on that drake corpse camping you... ;-)</div></div><hr />

I know right. I decided to check out the link and they're actively advertising stuff to help stop blizzard detecting you're being piloted, and them tracking you.<br />
They're evening selling WoW accounts on the site.. ranging from €400 - 1000+<br />
<br />
It's disgusting really.<br />

The drops really should scale up to the highest iLvl available, Because lets face it the current rewards certainly don't go with the effort required.<br />

Doubt anyone actually is doing that, would have been better with &quot;go back to struggle in level 15s/some mythic boss&quot; or similar. Or go to the extreme and say &quot;go back to LFR&quot;. Don't choose a weak middle point.<br />
