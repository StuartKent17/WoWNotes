Blue Tweets<br />
Transmog<br />
regarding legion tmog system. if my hunter can equip a dagger does that unlock that daggers tmog for all toons?<br />
The answer is yes, if you can equip it you unlock its appearance account-wide. Maybe try a less combative approach next time? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/702910203402977280))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
if PvP gear iLvL in Legion is based on your rating, is it an average or your highest or?..<br />
Each bracket will reward PvP gear based on your rating within that specific bracket. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/702989324791345152))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
I thought it had been previously stated that the Heart had not exerted influence and that Garrosh was acting on his own<br />
he wasn't corrupted or controlled, yes, but his personality flaws (e.g. xenophobia) certainly came out at 110% (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/702899387106664449))<br />

I know they cut off the rest of the post, but frankly, if they were a little more straightforward with their admittedly confusing and unnecessarily complicated plans for Transmog (the solution is simple: you &quot;see&quot; it drop, you unlock the visual effect, whether you &quot;win&quot; the RNG loot roll for it or not, or are on a toon that can equip it. You killed the boss, you saw the drop, you earned the xmog. This is not hard.) players wouldn't be getting so &quot;combative.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I think it is pretty self explanatory:<br />
You win an item that your class can equip -&gt; You get the xmog.<br />

Most of the developers have been extremely defensive when answering questions of late. Maybe they should realize that they lost 40% of their player base in a year and may want to not piss all over the remaining players when asked a simple question.</div></div><hr />

Lets be honest, whether or not you agree with the new transmog rules they're really not that fucking complicated. I really have no idea how it has been so difficult for people to understand them.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Diablo MMO would be awesome IMO, but knowing them, it will be like a Diablo themed Tower Defense game. Or go the Konami route, and make a Diablo slot machine or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me it's not a complaint, I've asked nicely about my question and they haven't seemed to get around to answering it, oh but the &quot;aggressive&quot; asking of that question asker was enough to warrant an answer.<br />
<br />
My question is mostly this: As an Enhancement Shaman, I can use dagger and fist weapon. When I'm wielding Doomhammer and Derphammer, are they going to ease the TMOG restrictions so I can say dual wield fist weapons? Or am I stuck with boring 1h axes/hammers?</div></div><hr />
