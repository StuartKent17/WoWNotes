June 21 Class Tuning Adjustments<br />

<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Mythic+ Loot<br />
Will we get higher than 905 gear in the weekly M+ cache on patch day if we complete a +15 the week leading up to the patch?<br />
The new level of Mythic Keystone 11-15 rewards will become active the week that the Mythic difficulty of Tomb of Sargeras opens. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/873311109045866496))<br />
<br />
Do i have to do a +15 this Week so i get Higher ilvl loot from my Weekly Chest or will the Cap still be +10 for another week?<br />
The M+ loot cap generally goes up when Mythic difficulty of the raid unlocks - that's how it worked for Nightmare and Nighthold. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/873239607340441600))<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
.why remove the FoS ''Unholy determination'' From the DK Class mount quest, for those who've done it? Thats a slap in the face.<br />
Don't want folks to feel the need to check guides before doing quests lest they miss out on something permanently without knowing it. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/873240201350397952))<br />
The FoS had been deleted in 7.2.5 data weeks ago. &quot;Missable&quot; achievements in one-time content would set a dangerous precedent. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/873239864904372224))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
You were on the WoW team still when it was said that there is too many currencies and it needed to be reined in. Since your departure, WoW has just seen more and more currencies added. Your thoughts on why this might be the case from a design perspective?<br />
Generally it happens because you want to encourage players to engage in lots of different forms of content. If you have say 3 currencies and 10 forms of content, then what probably happens is one of the currencies can be earned in many different ways and there is a risk players will gravitate towards the most efficient. Having different currencies also lets you offer rewards on different cadences (say something with not much buying power that you reward frequently, versus something very powerful that you only offer once a week or less.)<br />
<br />
The instincts to offer different rewards for different things makes your life a little easier for the designers, and often benefits players as well. The main downside is the growing complexity of a system, which can be overwhelming for players to keep straight.<br />
<br />
Caveat: I haven’t played WoW in over 3 years. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/159426782263/you-were-on-the-wow-team-still-when-it-was-said))<br />

The only reason veng is shining right now is the changes made to how Spirit Bomb works. Something the Veng community REPEATEDLY warned blizz about. It is/was absurd to give a tank that much %AP damage with no CD what so ever. <br />
<br />
The nerf doesn't even seem to make us not take Spirit Bomb anymore, it's still the go to at all times in that row.</div></div><hr />

Still ppl post to feel good. Lol<br />
Armory = copy paste <br />
Combine those credit from someone else build. Then the groupies come and then bam a nerf. <br />
Of course some nerf is unwarranted yet still happens. Say a dps farms different sets/gear, AP, and sims. Then average butt hurt joe loses in a dps to another dps screams a nerf. Even tho said guy pick gear over ilvl equipped 902 unequipped 916 and butt hurt joe is 905 equipped and unequipped.. haha love this game</div></div><hr />

So would you even keep Soul Cleave on your bars then? Seems like a waste of a cd if this is that much better.</div></div><hr />

unnerfed no, soul cleave served nearly no purpose. With the nerf maybe? IDK if the numbers have been run yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, so so much this!<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy crap this community, these buffs if you check the 75th percentile are exactly in line with current DPS rankings, there is no MMO on the market that is THIS closely balanced with its DPS, yet you guys regurlarly make it sound like the world is coming to an end.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Kaver is one of the people able to see that this tuning is resonable. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is doing an excellent job balancing the classes this xpac, and you who change specs on a dime due to nerfs/buffs only got yourselves to blame. If you enjoy a spec, stick to it. Stop trying to chase that top spot carrot, every single spec in the game has been up there.<br />

Simple. Some people like them, some people don't. If there are people that like them, I have no issue with them even if they are not something I care that much about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And people are talking about they want more complex talent systems with more choices like in vanilla where you could make hybrid builds... How the hell is blizzard going to balance that?!<br />
<br />
Blizzard are creating a product for people who wants complex systems, but at the same time they cry and yell and whine and yell and cry and complain if their class is changed just a tiny bit, even though it is completely justifiable. Imagine if the unbalanced situation of Vanilla (where only a handfull of specs were viable) was recreated in live. People would go batsh*t crazy.<br />
<br />
Players of WoW are literally (I hate that word) impossible to satisfy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From where are those numbers? <br />
<br />
The 7.2.5 changes ditching Agonizing Poison (passive ability) with Toxic Blade (active ability) is pressing sin more into the ST niche. You have to sit 100% on the target to get good numbers and if you are lucky with RNG (poison bomb, aligning/syncing abilities/CDs) - this is not possible most of the time - due to raid duties (adds etc.) or due to boss mechanics. Every second not sitting on the boss is a noticeably dps loss. On heroic you can stand in shit (ignoring mechanics) the healers can save you butt on mythic this is not possible.</div></div><hr />
