We are in the process of applying an in-game fix that will restart all of the quests associated with the Midsummer Fire Festival event and allow players to complete them once again. If you are in the process of completing an achievement such as Extinguishing Kalimdor, this fix will reset your progress and you will need start over. This fix will require realms to be restarted. <br />

Resilience more effective in 3.2<br />
I think you are dividing the bucket too cleanly into “classes that can survive” and “classes that can’t.” There has been a vigorous debate for some time within the community (and not just this forum) about damage and healing being too high in PvP. While some classes are worse than others, those are also the classes that received additional nerfs. Overall we need for characters to be a little more survivable when being beat on. They need a little more room to come up with a counter of some kind so that too many fights are not “use your ability within this 1 sec window or lose.” (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899681400-resilience-change.html))<br />
<br />
More Mana Regeneration needed in 3.2 Arenas?<br />
That assumes that caster mana is balanced around 30 second fights. It isn’t, and we aren’t talking about suddenly going to 30 minute fights. It could very well be a problem in practice, but we think it’s premature to assume that all dps casters are going to run out of mana now. There can be something between the two extremes of dying in 2 GCDs and having endless matches where the team to go OOM first loses. There can be something in between a sprint and a marathon.

Roar of Sacrifice in 3.2<br />
We like Roar of Sacrifice being used on other players for many of the same reasons players originally asked for it to be when we changed it. Furthermore, it's a talented pet ability, so it doesn't seem like that should be the linchpin of hunter PvP survival.<br />
<br />
At this point we are probably likely to keep RoS as is (though we may have room to lower the cooldown a little) but buff Deterrence by removing the facing requirement. Deterrence is supposed to be your survival tool and RoS is supposed to be a cool bonus ability.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you don't like it when PvE concerns affect PvP or vice versa. WoW supports both types of gameplay and we need to balance around both of them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17900023373-hunters-dont-go-through-with-the-ros-change.html))<br />

Beacon of Light<br />
<br />
I’ll try one more time. The following is painfully simplistic to the point of inaccurate, but I’m not sure how else to express the logic cleanly.<br />
<br />
PvE problem: Paladin healing routine is boring.<br />
Solution: Make Beacon usable on more targets.<br />
New PvE problem: Paladins are too good because mana regen is too high.<br />
Solution: Nerf Illumination (+1 for Beacon -1 for Illumination = 0).<br />
<br />
PvP problem: Damage and healing are too high.<br />
Solution: Change resilience and nerf healing. For paladins, the regen nerf already made above is probably sufficient for the latter.<br />
New PvP problem: But the buff to Beacon counteracts this nerf in PvE, leaving paladins at a net higher level of power (+1 for Resilience -1 for Illumination + 1 for Beacon = 1 (when we want zero)).<br />
Solution: None needed because Beacon isn’t a huge factor in PvP (the equation above is actually +1 for Resilience -1 for Illumination = 0). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899681400-resilience-change.html))<br />

Rogues able to use axes in 3.2<br />
Most of the axes will be one-hand, not main-hand. The reason we make the fists MH or OH isn't as a special favor to rogues or anything. It is usually because the art is designed to be left-handed or right-handed and looks really odd in the wrong hand (this is true of swords sometimes too). An axe is an axe though so we can make most if not all of them one-handed. We will drop more axes with this change -- this is why we are making the change. Shamans in Ulduar felt like there weren't enough axes. We want to be able to give them more options.

Enhancement DPS in PvP<br />
I understand the concern. We know that Enhancement shaman dps is in a really good place in PvE. Your experience in PvP seems to be that you can’t kill healers. The problem is we are hearing (and observing) many situations where players are dying in only a few hits. We have nerfed some of the big hitting abilities of say DKs, Retadins and even Destro locks. But we think damage would still be high even with those changes. If a single Enhancement shaman can take out a single healer, then when the healer is focused by two dps at once, they will have no chance.

Warrior Tanking / Block / Rage Starvation<br />
<br />
I’m not sure that statement is accurate, but here is the problem. There are A LOT of warrior tanks. They are tanking every fight in Ulduar. If warriors were too low and if we buffed them, I don’t see how that would increase the numbers on the other tanks. I don’t think the conclusion to be drawn is that warriors are overpowered. I think the conclusion to be drawn is that warriors were the traditional tank and lot of established guilds have established MTs who see no reason to reroll the FotM. It’s not actually a goal to have 25% of each tank in Ulduar, but is also seems strange to buff the most popular tank. Won’t that just make them more popular? Again, don’t misinterpret that as GC sez suck it up warriors. It is something we have to keep in mind, however.<br />
<br />
Block is a systemic problem. We're not sure we can make it a very compelling mitigation stat in a world where tank avoidance is so high and bosses hit so hard. However I will say that the Coliseum fights should focus less on the blow-your-cooldowns-or-die style of encounter.<br />
<br />
Rage starvation is a problem. Frankly, we're not sure a model where you have to get hit in order to tank is that compelling anymore. Something that has come up a lot is changing rage (even for Prot) to damage done. This is a slight nerf to the PvP mechanic of being punished when you hit the warrior, but there are other ways to solve that as well. Again, we're talking a big change here. I'm not sure we're comfortable jacking with such a core mechanic before 3.2. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17899683851-warrior-community-let-down.html))</div></div><hr />

(i say &quot;like 60%&quot; coz in 2-2 or 3-3 (atm 5-5 is instand death for any1 - 3 dps focus killing in 1 or 2 gcd) single healer cant have 100% healing-spam-time coz of CC, burst, split dps, LoS etc etc etc) So 2 special attacks (one of em deal dmg based on both weapons dps, 2nd - on OH weapon dps) give us a chanse to realize around 40% of our &quot;dps potencial&quot;...i can live with it if we have good CC (not this funny thing called hex...frog with vanish+sprint 4tw) or good surv. toold but we havent it...

Theres also an slight chance that they didn't open premade character copy up, very small, but I did copy my premades already. Truthfully thinking about it now, I should have only copyed 1-2 premades that I was least intrested in, but *shrug*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Kinda yeah, but it had to be done since they weren't reset previously likevthey should have. These quests have to be available to those who did them last year. For all those who just did them this year congratz on your double blossoms/ gold/ experiance. <br />
<br />
Also to the one who posted about the blossoms staying I reseting, I don't even believe they fixed it yet. It said it will require a server restart and i'm almost positive that didn't happen yet. But when it does, you will keep them, but will have to restart any unfinished achieves to desecrate/honor flames.</div></div><hr />

It's the same installer they've used for every PTR phase since 3.0. You install that 3.0.1 test client, and on login (once the servers are up, that is) you'll download the next client and it'll update to the 3.2 test client.<br />
<br />
...assuming they do things the same way, of course. It might also be a big waste of time, but I think it's safe to download and install that one for now. That's what I'm doing.</div></div><hr />

This bug affected too many people in a way or another. Players who are completing all the quests will have to do them again. People who could NOT complete them (bug) had to wait. People who did NOT complete the quests will keep the blossoms, allowing more purchases compared to players who regularly completed everything until the hotfix.<br />
<br />
In my opinion Blizz should have canceled the event until the fix was ready and THEN restart it for everyone. I did enjoi visiting all the bonfires and decided to complete al lthe achievements the first day... but I perfectly understand it's just bad doing all of them once again.</div></div><hr />

I understand the concern. We know that Enhancement shaman dps is in a really good place in PvE. Your experience in PvP seems to be that you can&#8217;t kill healers. The problem is we are hearing (and observing) many situations where players are dying in only a few hits. We have nerfed some of the big hitting abilities of say DKs, Retadins and even Destro locks. But we think damage would still be high even with those changes. If a single Enhancement shaman can take out a single healer, then when the healer is focused by two dps at once, they will have no chance.

Wut? You are NOT SUPPOSED to be able to kill a healer yourself as enh, because then IF TWO DPS are going for the healer, he will have trouble to survive?<br />
<br />
I tell ya what, when TWO DPS are going for a single healer, he HAS TO f**king die, not spam /lol emotes at me/us and survive on like nothing happens.<br />
<br />
So Enh is not allowed to kill stuff, because he could get help by another dps and then it would be unfair to the poor healers? Yeah, right.</div></div><hr />

Sounds funny, yes, but if they rly make healers so easy killable by 2 dps then 3-3 bracket will be fucked up with 3 dps teams....so healers shoud be able to survive 2 dps burst but not forever, just for 15 sec or so... (as they atm do ex. pallys ;) )</div></div><hr />

I lol'd at this too. They must be talking about resto shamans only :P, because I have seen plenty of Rdruids take 3+ dps, along with some geared and talented Disc priests, and I think some pallies, but I have never seen a resto shaman take many more than 2.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes the logic just flies right over there. **whoooosh**<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you miss the start of that quote that said that fists tend to be MH or OH due to art considerations? Given the choice between a one-hand axe and an off-hand fist, the fist is MUCH more likely to result in a situation where no-one wants the epic. Sharding KT's loot is happening frequently enough, I'd rather not see people sharding Yogg fist because Shammys want more offhand options.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In reponse to the quote about warrior rage starvation:<br />
<br />
Very simple solution, allow Blessing of Sanctuary to allow rage return again like it did when wrath released. stop creating problems with previous nerfs and then wondering &quot;oh wtf happened!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Congratulations, you have just made it mandatory for prot warriors to be accompanied by a pally with at least 21 points in prot. Which would get pretty annoying for building 10-man raids, let alone the new 5-man instances.</div></div><hr />

Warrior Tanking / Block / Rage Starvation<br />
<br />
I’m not sure that statement is accurate, but here is the problem. There are A LOT of warrior tanks. They are tanking every fight in Ulduar. If warriors were too low and if we buffed them, I don’t see how that would increase the numbers on the other tanks. I don’t think the conclusion to be drawn is that warriors are overpowered. I think the conclusion to be drawn is that warriors were the traditional tank and lot of established guilds have established MTs who see no reason to reroll the FotM. It’s not actually a goal to have 25% of each tank in Ulduar, but is also seems strange to buff the most popular tank. Won’t that just make them more popular? Again, don’t misinterpret that as GC sez suck it up warriors. It is something we have to keep in mind, however.<br />
<br />
Block is a systemic problem. We're not sure we can make it a very compelling mitigation stat in a world where tank avoidance is so high and bosses hit so hard. However I will say that the Coliseum fights should focus less on the blow-your-cooldowns-or-die style of encounter.<br />
<br />
Rage starvation is a problem. Frankly, we're not sure a model where you have to get hit in order to tank is that compelling anymore. Something that has come up a lot is changing rage (even for Prot) to damage done. This is a slight nerf to the PvP mechanic of being punished when you hit the warrior, but there are other ways to solve that as well. Again, we're talking a big change here. I'm not sure we're comfortable jacking with such a core mechanic before 3.2. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17899683851-warrior-community-let-down.html))<br />

We are too many? <br />
Ok after 4 years of paying maybe it's time to stop right?<br />

<br />
So just because Players did not give up on their class and some dps warriors switched to tanking because this way they at least fill a roll that is more important and not very many players want to take it. we are bound to be worse untill guilds trade us out for FotM classes or as GC says it in his post further down enough of us &quot;burn out or something&quot; because they can not stand beeing the by blizz admited worst tank and not beeing buffed... blizz sucks and this blue post has to be followed by some warrior changes</div></div><hr />

Now dont get me wrong we can handle a lot but in some cases for example Halls of Stone gauntlet part, as a warrior is difficult to grab all the mobs as they rush down the stairs. We as warriors are limited on multi mob spells unlike a Pally. Thunder clap is one of the best spells for this porpose but is limited due to its cooldown. I request (and hope im not alone in this) that Thunder clap can have a longer duration or a shorter cooldown timer to allow us to grab multiple rushs of mobs more easily. Warriors as long as I can remember and from the many MMORPGS and RPGs I have played are suppose to be the superior tank. This doesn't have to be the case but could be at least on a better scale and match a pally a little better in the multi-grab area. With stationary mobs like in most instances its not to bad ...charge thunder clap, shockwave and you got em, but in cases as in Halls of stone or other similar cases we should be just as effective or close to in my opinion and as I stated before I hope im not alone in this belief.</div></div><hr />

Ye we couldnt have that, could we.. better to not have any prot warriors at all, your logic is so pure.<br />
<br />
Im getting so tired of all this retard arguments for not buffing warriors, its starting to get to the point where you either reroll or stop playing if you wanna do endgame in a serious matter.<br />
<br />
Bringing a warrior to a raid is possible, but not optimal and thats not how it should be. They talk about class balance, about bringing the player not the class, and yet they just keep looking the other way on warriors. Bullshit.</div></div><hr />

Uh, what?<br />
<br />
Are you retarded? You can tclap every few seconds WHEREVER YOU WANT. When a Pally puts down a Consecrate, he can't get threat anywhere else for 8 seconds. Warriors are much better at grabbing mobile mobs in a group situation. (Shockwave???)<br />

<br />
I am on Zangarmarsh...our entire battlegroup has been down the last two Tuesdays all night, and this is worse.<br />
<br />
What a pain in the ass...worst world event ever...that violet proto drake better be awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Got into the game yesterday, and this did not happen thankfully so I finished up Kalimdor as fast as I could.</div></div><hr />
