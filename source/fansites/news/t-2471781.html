New Graphics APIs in 8.1.5<br />
In 8.1.5, we are making some improvements to how World of Warcraft uses DirectX. In essence, our old DirectX 11 is now called DirectX 11 Legacy, and our new DirectX 11 is multi-threaded. More details on each DirectX version is below:<br />
<br />
DirectX 11 Legacy<br />
A single-threaded rendering backend. This is provided to be the most compatible with older hardware, operating systems, and drivers. This is also the least performant. This is very similar to the functionality of DirectX 11 in 8.0.1.<br />
<br />
DirectX 11<br />
A new multi-threaded rendering backend using DirectX 11. This should improve performance for older GPUs or operating systems that don’t support DirectX 12. This is new for 8.1.5.<br />
<br />
DirectX 12<br />
A multi-threaded rendering backend using DirectX 12 for hardware, drivers, and operating systems that support it. There are some performance improvements in 8.1.5, but it is mainly the same as the 8.1.0 release.1 Reply1<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Supports DirectX 12 on Windows 7<br />
After we saw the performance gains of using multi-threaded rendering in DirectX 12 for the initial Tides of Vengeance update, we worked together with Microsoft and our hardware vendors to bring similar performance gains to our Windows 7 users. We are pleased to announce that with today’s content update, World of Warcraft will now support DirectX 12 on Windows 7. This allows our Windows 7 users to take advantage of the performance benefit of using DirectX 12, which was previously only available to our Windows 10 users.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 users will need to make sure they have the latest graphics drivers to use DirectX 12. If your GPU supports DirectX 12 on Windows 7, you may enable it by selecting it in the Advanced System settings, under &quot;Graphics API&quot;.<br />

<br />
On the other hand with the new multi-thread support for DX11, it could be the same performance on Win 8.1 as Win10 with DX12 on the same hardware?<br />
I was planning to Update from Win 8.1 into Win 10, just for having benefit from new multi-thread, but will not do it then.<br />

Weird move (from Microsoft) considering support ends in less than a year. Maybe they have plans to prolong Win7 even for private users? I would be willing to pay a lot of money if I can keep Win7 for longer. I might check out the patch just because of that lol.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard worked with Microsoft on it, then it's entirely possible but phrased badly.<br />
<br />
What I mean is, WoW doe not fully utilise the &quot;new&quot; features of DX12, it's not even close, when it runs in DX12 mode it's basically a DX11 game using legacy DX11 assets still present in DX12 but also some of the new codepath to utilise some DX12 improvements.<br />
<br />
So on that basis as the game only uses a tiny amount of DX12 it's entirely possible that Microsoft have helped Blizzard bring those features to Windows 7, as kind of a DirectX 12 &quot;lite&quot;/&quot;express&quot;.<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
<br />
Yeah MS pretty much confirm it won't run as well on 7 as on 10:<br />

A Windows 10 licence (official!) costs 10€ on Amazon (maybe less for US) and there are a lot more benefits than just this improvement in wow...</div></div><hr />

It isn't about money. Whilst there are improvements in Windows 10, there's also a whole bunch of undesirable crap that people don't want, such as the forced updates and telemetry out the ass. Personally, I use LTSC as it's the closest thing there is to Windows 7 and allows you to have control back over things like updating, but it's hardly a ringing endorsement of Windows 10 to say that the best version is the one that's as close as possible to a decade-old OS.</div></div><hr />

You can disable all of this and in case you didnt know, there is already some telemetry in Windows 7 too... Auto updates ARE A GOOD THING (!!), because people having vulnerable outdated OS are the cause of most of &quot;virus/trojan&quot; problems. If you are up to date, you're a lot less likely to be vulnerable... but well, a lot of people are clueless anyway... <br />
<br />
Stop using smartphones, google, amazon,... if you don't want to be tracked... not updating to windows 10 (but using win7 instead of unix) is totally useless. If you don't want to give informations to microsoft, don't use Win7, use linux/unix...<br />
<br />
A lot of things, and I mean A LOT of things are not compatible/updated for Win 7 anymore and support will end next year anyway.</div></div><hr />

Tried it back in time, reverted to 8.1.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psygon</div><div class="date">2019-03-13, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Microsoft has more than enough devs to keep up security updates for XP, 7, 8 and 10. They don't because of one reason: licensing agreements. Everything they include requires a license, so things like the DIVX video codec for XP Media Center are no longer valid. Microsoft doesn't want to touch old software licensing.<br />
<br />
Instead they just throw up their arms and say, that's it! Windows 10 or nothing. Although you lose Aeroglass, the Win10 experience isn't bad, so it's usable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DX11 Legacy: 170 FPS<br />
DX11: 200 FPS<br />
DX12: 195 FPS<br />
<br />
Changed a couple of times between DX11/12 to make sure, and DX11 is slightly ahead in every situation. A good update for Win7 users, especially if you have a 144hz screen. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you can't disable all of it. Even national governments cannot.<br />
<br />
And their updates have repeatedly broken stuff to the point of making PCs unusable. That's not exactly a speaking in their favour.<br />
<br />
Yes, auto-updates are good for simple users that don't really know what they're doing. For more advanced users, it's a different matter, and they might very well be more trouble than it is worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I7 8700 1070 ti and I got everything on highest except view distance and env detail on 9, shadows on 2nd highest and AA on 2xMSAA<br />
<br />
Not perfect but I'll freaking take smooth frames in boralus and raids without having to use raid settings with a big smile!</div></div><hr />
