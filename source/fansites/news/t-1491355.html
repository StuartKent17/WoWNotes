I would say no. Due to the models in &quot;outland&quot; have been effected by the cataclysm of the world being torn apart. As such that is why they look that way.</div></div><hr />

I too am also a but torn about the new Talbuk models. The talbuks are one of my most favorite mounts but these new models just... It lost the majestic and regal look and made way for *dundundunDUN* savage. More muscles, thicker legs, blockier hooves.<br />
<br />
I like the longer tail though. Meh, I just think the muzzle is bothering me. Maybe I'll change my mind when I see them animated. Did always love the talbuk's 'run' animation, it was very fluid.</div></div><hr />

Oh noes, someone has a different opinion on a mount model. This cannot be allowed to stand. Internet crusaders, away!<br />
<br />
Seriously, art is subjective. You like it? Fine, go ahead an use it. Personally I think the head's too big and they went overboard with the &quot;savage&quot; theme, losing the sleekness of the old model. Therefore I hope the old mounts will be keeping their model.</div></div><hr />

I think many people will be of the same mind. I'm 90% sure they'll leave the old mounts alone and only use the new model for new content. If they don't, there will be a riot.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, look closely at your character next time they ride a drake on the ground, and watch how the spikes on the back of their neck impale your toon through the face. <br />

But he has long hair in that model. Yes, he shaved the rest. You can't argue with that Trassk... Metzen's word is law. If he says Draenei's started eating Azeroth's grass and became green then that is canon, end of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm puzzled about that too. That Velen model kinda feels like current Vol'jin model, just more polygons on same skeleton. I fear that it's just semi-placeholder model because draenei male models won't be finished before launch? <br />
<br />
Sounds stupid but hey, it's draenei models or raid tier! And fucking npc orcs must be finished first because... orcs.</div></div><hr />

I love the level of fantasy that seems to come with the mobs like the Pale Orcs the Draenor Ancients, Gorem, and the Hippos. It's just that their models look so new and alien to this game (which is what they were going for i guess given that Draenor is completely different from outlands or Azeroth). It's something new, and feels liek it's from a whole different game, which i think we definitely needed in WoW. <br />
<br />
Alot of these mobs look like they belong in Gorgrond such as those Hippos, some of those Clefthoof, the Goren, and even some of those Ancients. I think their shoud be a more Gorgrond-themed Ancient though. Basically, he'd have steam shooting out of those things on his back. I also can't wait to see other mobs that would inhabit places like Tanaan Jungle or Spires of Arakk! Perhaps we might also see the giant sea creatures that would be in the Zangar Seas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those models are needed in-game, even there's a little problem with Talbuks, check their tail, I guess that we will ride My Little Pony (Talbuk)<br />
<br />
the talbuks look like utter crap How did they take one of the most elegant mounts in the entire game into some kyrin wannabe crossed with a dog with a horse tail that has been on a super dose of steroids its entire life.<br />
<br />
I don't see what the problem is. They look majestic, but with a savage draenor twist to them which is what Blizzard was going for with everything this expansion. <br />
<br />
That Yellow Talbuk reminds me of Jolteon though, and it hink that it looks cool, lol.</div></div><hr />

Is it confirmed btw if this AU draenor is 100% same as MU draenor before rise of the horde? <br />
<br />
Ie. did those MU orcs (eitrigg, saurfang and other old geezers) strangle those kind of ugly talbuks as adulthood rite? Or was MU draenor talbuk really less &quot;savage&quot; but still different than MU outland talbuk?<br />

If its a separated dimension, with no origins at a timeline started by the portal Garrosh takes, it would be even more lame to not forget the revenge in the MU Azeroth, and concentrate in the AU.<br />
Garrosh actually should just jaywilson, and say &quot;f*ck that losers&quot;, and go conquer AU Azeroth, forgetting anything about MU Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I see are reused skeletons from ages ago in every single expansion. I don't think there is one unique skeleton in these images, well perhaps one modified but still, what the flying **** is wrong with them not making new ones???<br />
<br />
I've never seen any game recycle models like Blizzard, and it's funny because they should have the money/resources to make more models than anyone else.<br />
<br />
So yeah, wtf?<br />
<br />
<br />
They save the new models for the store.<br />
<br />
Both of you are so wondrously ignorant about what you're talking about here. These are ALL new models. The only thing that's been recycled are the skeletons in some cases, and frankly, until you see them move you can't even definitively say that for all of them. <br />
<br />
Just because you seem to lack even the limited brain functioning to distinguish between the two, here's a quick preschool-level tutorial.<br />
<br />
Models are how the object looks. Skeletons define how the object is animated (the rigging of the limbs, mouth, anything that moves in the model basically).<br />
<br />
None of these models shown here have been seen before, therefore they are not recycled.<br />
<br />
As for why Blizzard recycles skeletons, it's all about time. It takes a significant amount of time to come up with entirely new animations for every single new model type - if they did, then there would be considerably less new models in the expansion, which would cause even more QQ from you lot on the forums. There's no sense in creating entirely different animations for similarly shaped creatures when you already have some available and are on a major time constraint.</div></div><hr />

I stopped riding mine when they screwed up the riding animation with Cata. However, I liked Talbuks because they were sleek, elegant and almost gazelle-like... These look badass, sure, but they also look insanely spiky and muscled. Not really the same feel as the old ones... dunno how I quite feel about that. I hope there will be armored versions that may look a bit less... lumpy?<br />
<br />
Can't help it but.. How many times have we heard it's the Old Draenor? It SHOULD look like this. You know it's a Talbuk. But between this Model and the Old one are like.. 20-30 Years and .. something like... THE WHOLE PLANET BEING TORN ASUNDER?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if anybody doesn't like them but you gotta honor Blizzard right there.<br />
<br />
They didn't do any fanservice for the Old-Model Lovers at all. It's a REAL Talbuk, not some twisted creature like the current ones. And all of these Models scream &quot;SAVAGE!&quot; which is perfect. Because that's the only word you could describe everything about Old Draenor with. Everything can bite off your Head if it so pleases. This is no Planet of Happy Space Gazelles running through the green fields of Nagrand. This is Raw Warcraft Power. The Homeland of one of the Two Major Races, Warcraft is about. You can Stay in Outland all day, if you like the Old Talbuks more. But just don't think about talking the new Beasts bad. Because for the Theme and Lore of Draenor AND this Expansion - These are the most fucking perfect creatures they could come up with.</div></div><hr />

How do you suggest they make new skeletons for animals that SHOULD be moving in the same way as already existing animals? Such as the talbuks...it DOES make sense for them to run like talbuks have since TBC, no? Or should they run on 2 legs?<br />

What is the problem? You'll still have the originals...these are from a more savage world at that, so makes sense they look more rugged and, quite frankly, awesome.<br />

<br />
Oh, no! Don't call me a child!<br />
<br />
I guess you missed half the tier and pvp sets then?<br />
<br />
But I'll give you a little credit, they really focused on the Asian style for most of it. Left all of the spikes and wooden boards for certain tier and pvp sets, and Orgrimmar. Blizzard will be sending you a paycheck for your white knighting any day now. Hold your breath until it gets there.<br />
<br />
Either way, I wasn't a fan of that style in Wrath, wasn't a fan of it being carried over into parts of cataclysm, and I'm certainly not a fan of it being the main theme of a whole new expansion. But I guess when you build the expansion around your beloved orc race there really isn't much of an option. Maybe Draenei will add a refreshing touch to it and bring back a feel of some of the original BC style.</div></div><hr />

They run like old dogs with hip dysplasia and weak elbows. I hate the way they run. I'd much prefer they ran like normal wolves. At least they're not as bad as the raptors/raven mounts and their bouncing.</div></div><hr />

And IF they would actually make new skeletons for everything - I wonder how long it takes until you cry about them taking too much time. Funny, that's what your lot is. Really really funny.<br />
Sorry to disappoint but the internet doesn't make me butthurt and his post didn't prove me wrong. He just said exactly what Blizzard always does &quot;it takes a long time to create new skeletons so we just reuse ALMOST ALL OF THEM&quot;.<br />
And as I said, they obviously could use their money to do so, and in less time, but I guess they don't need to since people like you are satisfied with seeing the same creatures moving everywhere just with a different skin.<br />
<br />
Except he's right and you are wrong. So what do you do? Oh you insult him.<br />
<br />
Clearly not the response of a pre-schooler.<br />
It was directed at the way that he jumps out insulting others and nothing else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And you can bash me or whatever all you want, you are the ones putting up with their crap.</div></div><hr />

I love the new Talbuk =/ I guess to each his own, but between the life-like muscularity, sexy plumage, and menacing horns it's quite a nice upgrade from the originals.</div></div><hr />

Oh god, those talbuks. Those wolves. Those hippos and rhinos. That everything. I will mount it all.<br />
<br />
I hope we can use both old and new talbuk models for riding, since I actually still really do like the old ones, but the new ones are so goddamn sexy. Models always hype me up real good.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just noticed that these talbuk have different tails! Their counterparts have short tails with fur lining them, but these are more like horses' tails! That's very interesting :D (another edit: AKA the hair has grown out on the tailbone as opposed to being cut very short but yeah)</div></div><hr />

I stopped riding mine when they screwed up the riding animation with Cata. However, I liked Talbuks because they were sleek, elegant and almost gazelle-like... These look badass, sure, but they also look insanely spiky and muscled. Not really the same feel as the old ones... dunno how I quite feel about that. I hope there will be armored versions that may look a bit less... lumpy?<br />
<br />
Most antelope-type animals have discernible muscle tone, unless the lumps you're referring to are all the bone/horn protrusions. If so, I'd agree the horns on it's rump look a little out of place, but otherwise, they look pretty natural-ish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Aub</div><div class="date">2014-04-08, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must be the only person who cares about the fact that Wolves and Boars are native to Azeroth and NOT Draenor. It makes no sense for them to be in Draenor when the only reason they're in Outland is because the Orcs took them from Azeroth when the Dark Portal was initially open. In addition, the only reason the Helboars were giant and had spikes was due to the raw fel energy they were exposed to in Hellfire Peninsula. Now they exist in the past and have spikes because SAVAGE... I guess Talbuks needed moar savage too and got spikes coming out of their rears.<br />
:-| <br />
<br />
Clefthoof (Clefthooves?) now have tusks? I guess after the portal summoning incident that turned it into Outland there was a huge Ivory shortage and they generously donated their tusks for the good of Orc-kind. Those greedy Elekk held on to theirs. I guess that's why we slaughter them for theirs for the Consortium.<br />
<br />
While I kinda like the updated models, it only looks like 10 new creature models with plenty of colored variants. I'm being generous and including the Kor'kron War Wolf (They just removed the armor) and the Sporebats (which are pretty much recolored). This is pretty much what they've done with every expansion; create a dozen or so &quot;new&quot; models and then recolor them several times over and claim new content.<br />
<br />
As for Thrall, I like his updated look. He has his old Doom Plate back on while still wearing his Shaman trench coat and beads. It's a very nice mesh of what he was and what he has become. People freaking out about his hair are a strange lot. Hairstyles can change and he updated his.<br />
<br />
I really wish Blizzard would not make the hunchbacked Orc mandatory if you want to play one, the only orcs who should be hunchbacked are the Peons. Every other Orc should be as upright as they've made Thrall. That's a major reason I won't ever play a male Orc. Grommash looks like a hulking behemoth, completely unlike how he's always been described.</div></div><hr />

Not going to lie: hoping to see some demons too, since we still have Gul'dan there, green like he ever was... Updated demons (for a future patch, at least :) would be awesome for my Lock XD</div></div><hr />

Now obviously there would be a fair bit of pressure to update him because of the Draenei update, but to create an entirely new model for one zone (where a simple polygon increase would have sufficed) is intriguing. It lends some credence to my predictions that MU Velen will have a fair amount of importance in later patches.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to see that WOW is getting the model overhaul it needed, the games progressed so much even from when I started (WOTLK).<br />
