You have to keep in mind, all this talk of &quot;world's first guilds have normal lives and normal jobs just like you and me~&quot; tends to be complete fabrication. They dedicate their all to this like you would a professional sport and stop only to sleep. Those that don't are almost bound to never get a podium finish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because...its a new fight in a new raid? blame blizzard for bringing back old characters back not guilds that kill it .... anyway GZ Method!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What concerns me is the 472 attempts, that's just crazy! I think Blizzard ought to have a look at this sort of thing in the future, it doesn't matter who you are and what level you are at, no boss should take 472 attempts. In saying that, it does make the kill that bit more impressive, they managed to kill a vastly overtuned boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you figure a 5 minute average per attempt (not knowing how long the fight actually is), and a couple minutes between each pull, that's a raw 63 hours of fighting. The raid has only been out for 3 weeks. They killed Mannoroth 9 days ago. If they played every day since then, that's an average of 7 hours every day pushing attempts.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they should have just waited a few weeks and AFK'd through LFR. Effort is for losers.<br />

Not really, in Method at least the majority of them do work normal jobs or are students, and they agree to take 2 weeks off for each tier for the race. <br />
This actually caused problems for them, as on Monday and Tuesday they only raided for half of the day, and yesterday if you check the logs a few of the main raiders aren't there for the first kills of the day because they were busy working.</div></div><hr />

Are you from the US or something? I'm pretty sure in most EU countries it's not legal for a company to let you work if you still have vacation days at the end of the year. My parents have around 5 weeks of vacation days that they have to take even if they don't want to. Their institutions would get some pretty hefty fines if they allowed them to go back to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my country, technically, it's not legal. But in practice everyone &quot;saves&quot; some days for next year.. My friend at work, after 11 years has over 60 overdue days off on top of every years 27 days :P Technically he could go on almost 90 work days vacations (5 days per week make it 18 weeks, about 4.5 months :P).. Of course he can't, no boss will allow you so many days off, but, technically it's possible.<br />
<br />
But as far as top guilds go - they had vacations for a week or two, then they did revert to less hours per day - like to 8h instead 16h, because some raiders did have to go back to work.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the raid - big congrats to Method. Somehow I'm not surprised, even though I did cheer on Paragon :P Still well deserved congrats. At least till another account sharing/gear funneling or something pops up:P We all know someone will find something to undermine their achievement :P</div></div><hr />

It means the same as it always did as far as I'm concerned - namely, it's the game's public beta test of all the new bosses.<br />

Well balanced? Nigh-on 500 attempts is not well balanced; it's grossly overtuned.<br />
<br />
I distinctly remember Kinaesthesia from vodka making the point that Ragnaros didn't kill players.<br />
<br />
He killed guilds.<br />
<br />
This time, with a boss that took longer to kill (and many more to get through first), I can only see the results being worse. It looks to me that, without some serious retuning of Archimonde, he's going to decimate what passes for guild culture these days.<br />
<br />

You realize that it is pretty much killable in any of the other dificulties? And those who do mythic expect it to be a lot harder? It wont &quot;decimate&quot; guilds, as no one is forced to do only mythic.... And even mythic will be progressively easier in the following weeks, with more and more players getting the legendary ring? And upgrading it everyweek up to 795?<br />
<br />
Method did an excellent job and can say they are the ONLY guild in the world having killed him at this state and without any legendary rings... as the other contenders all have at least one.</div></div><hr />

All of that was the case for Ragnaros, too, and we know what happened.<br />
<br />
What makes you think this will be any different, especially considering it'll take players longer to get there and guilds are already struggling to maintain steady rosters for a final tier that's going to likely last a year?<br />

They're just going to kill it themselves by shoving every player into raids that are horribly overtuned for pretty close to all of them.<br />
<br />
Gee. Gee. Bro.<br />
<br />
Well, actually 25 H Rag was 500+ attempts for Paragon. And, Archi is tuned around the legendary ring. When guilds have more rings at their disposals, they'll have an easier time killing Archi.<br />

Curious how you quantify what qualifies as progression? If a person or group of persons wants to be the best at anything, regardless of whether you personally find any meaning in it or not, it takes putting in what most would consider an insane amount of time and commitment to do so.<br />
<br />
if u srsly think they derped around for 472 attempts until they got 'lucky' . .then I suppose your in the right thread. keep posting in that case, I want to read what else you have to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What concerns me is the 472 attempts, that's just crazy! I think Blizzard ought to have a look at this sort of thing in the future, it doesn't matter who you are and what level you are at, no boss should take 472 attempts. In saying that, it does make the kill that bit more impressive, they managed to kill a vastly overtuned boss.<br />

I'm pretty sure in most EU countries it's not legal for a company to let you work if you still have vacation days at the end of the year. My parents have around 5 weeks of vacation days that they have to take even if they don't want to. Their institutions would get some pretty hefty fines if they allowed them to go back to work.<br />
<br />
If you're in the US Army you were able to carry 75 days over year to year(it used to be 60, but might change this October again). Basically 2.5 years worth of leave since you got 30 days a year.<br />

Actually they have several alts that they gear up at the same time. So doing raid 3 times a week PER CHARACTER perhaps. As far as I can tell streaming/being hardcore progression WoW players IS their job. At least to some of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well balanced? Nigh-on 500 attempts is not well balanced; it's grossly overtuned.<br />
<br />
I distinctly remember Kinaesthesia from vodka making the point that Ragnaros didn't kill players.<br />
<br />
He killed guilds.<br />
<br />
This time, with a boss that took longer to kill (and many more to get through first), I can only see the results being worse. It looks to me that, without some serious retuning of Archimonde, he's going to decimate what passes for guild culture these days.<br />
<br />

Gee. Gee. Bro.<br />
<br />
He is not overtuned, he is tuned to be killed with legendary rings. That's the difference.<br />
No he wont shit all over future guilds cause they will attempt him with a shitloads of rings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone that thinks otherwise is high. Ragnaros gear inflation was virtually nonexistant - just the gear you got from your single heroic clear that week, only 6 bosses at that.<br />
Now we get 12 bosses worth of gear every week as well as legendary rings that everyone will have beyond the very top top guilds before they kill this boss, your average pre-nerf Ragnaros kill didn't have any tarecgosas at all (In fact, he was nerfed shortly after most guilds started finishing them at all). Ragnaros and Archimonde may have been similar difficulty for Method - I'm not one to comment there beyond raw attempts required, but it will absolutely deflate with difficulty much much much more sharply as the weeks go on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's reasonable to assume that once you get upwards of 450 attempts, the difference is counted in tens rather than units.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros was also available after almost half the number of bosses that are present in Hellfire Citadel.<br />
<br />
Another interesting corollary is the strict raiding sizes that had a significant impact on the raiding community in their given expansion. Of course, Cataclysm moved from Wrath and made a mess, while Warlords presents the problem within its own tier.<br />
<br />
But, sure. Keep thinking it's because I'm &quot;salty&quot; about not doing something I haven't bothered to do since Deathwing. Whatever feeds your narrative, bro.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, the rest of the time, they follow a standard raiding schedule, hell, I wouldn't be surprised that they raid less than the average raider doing 3 nights a week on a yearly basis.<br />
<br />
They say that, but the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. I'd suggest the average raiding guild from heroic and up goes for 9 to 12 hours a week, and the top guilds certainly always appear to be doing at least that, and certainly more when there's another tier to prepare for.<br />
<br />
End of expansion tiers? Well, everyone drops their hours relatively quickly when they know they have a year to complete something.<br />
<br />
<br />
He is not overtuned, he is tuned to be killed with legendary rings. That's the difference.<br />
No he wont shit all over future guilds cause they will attempt him with a shitloads of rings.<br />

Those guys in Method are the best because they have an amazing talent PLUS they put extreme amounts of clock hours into the game.

No, they're all keeping shut about it because they don't want to take the chance of accidentally giving other guilds hints or tips while the race is still going on for the next top spots. On the post-kill stream of Method's tank (Sco), he did vaguely hint that there may be a similar thing to original Hyjal Archimonde where he &quot;dies&quot; before he actually reaches 0% (i.e. the wisps at 10%). But did not confirm anything. He did say that the boss fight ends up being pretty underwhelming and anticlimactic.<br />

Ok, my point is that it was not &quot;like a real job&quot; as he had said, because in fact they dont receive payment other than bonuses and maybe pc parts. And also that it was not something to rely to make a living.

You are literally arguing semantics, in which you are STILL wrong, and yet you fail to understand that the entire premise of your argument is idiotic and pedantic as well as incorrect. It's not anything close to a long-term profession, but it is still a job. Saying that because you only mowed your neighbor's lawn a day or two, or watched their kids while they went out isn't a job is just ridiculous and imbecilic.

That's how it's generally understood in English, too.<br />
<br />
When someone talks about their &quot;job&quot;, they're invariably talking about how they make a living. Therefore, because Method don't make a living out of playing World of Warcraft, it's perfectly reasonable to say it's not a job. On the other hand, if we're talking about professional gamers who do make their living out of playing games (Starcraft 2, League of Legends et al), then it's perfectly fair to call that a job.<br />

Bullying =/= Telling people a hard truth if they're wrong about something. But you go on and be you, Mr. Knight. You are trying to compare the connotative definition of &quot;job&quot; with the denotative definition of &quot;job&quot;, when they are not mutually exclusive nor do they need to be mutually inclusive. I apologize that some people like myself know more about linguistics than others and get frustrated when someone clearly is wrong in their argument of their misguided view on said rule of linguistics. <br />
<br />
Taking a part-time job assignment that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks is still just as much of a job as someone working a 9-5 when you take the denotative definition of the word. Arguing whether or not it is a job to you is akin to arguing whether or not (ballet, soccer, football, chess, wrestling, etc) is really a sport or not because you don't consider it to be a sport by your own conditions.</div></div><hr />

I don't give much time or concern for those that present themselves as uneducated or uninformed unless it's for the sake of self-gain*. I value intelligence much higher than most anything else, and thus anyone who doesn't show value has little value. I'm just able to admit it and express it more than others. Granted, if someone makes a mistake, I won't hold it against them. Everyone makes those. When someone addresses it and they are still wrong is when they're marked. <br />

Actually, behind that &quot;im not afraid to say the hard truth&quot; mask you are using, you are indeed being very rude and disruptive to others. In fact, i agreed with you about semantics and &quot;admitted&quot; being wrong, even though form of communication is not as black and white as you are painting, and the definition of communication functioning right is if the receptor of the message understood it, no matter if the speaker is exact, perfect, formal in using any form of language. <br />

In fact, i agreed with you about semantics and &quot;admitted&quot; being wrong, even though form of communication is not as black and white as you are painting, and the definition of communication functioning right is if the receptor of the message understood it, no matter if the speaker is exact, perfect, formal in using any form of language. <br />

<br />
When someone talks about their &quot;job&quot;, they're invariably talking about how they make a living. Therefore, because Method don't make a living out of playing World of Warcraft, it's perfectly reasonable to say it's not a job. On the other hand, if we're talking about professional gamers who do make their living out of playing games (Starcraft 2, League of Legends et al), then it's perfectly fair to call that a job.<br />
<br />
Don't let anyone bully you into thinking otherwise.<br />
<br />
That is not true, well, at least not in the US. A job can be anything from a one time thing to something long term. If you are getting paid to do it, it is a job. However, a long-term job is generally referred to as a career. I doubt anyone in Method considers playing WoW a career.</div></div><hr />

That moment when someone belittles someone else for arguing semantics, while their entire argument is nothing more than how they interpret what &quot;a job&quot; means.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pua</div><div class="date">2015-07-18, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bullying =/= Telling people a hard truth if they're wrong about something. But you go on and be you, Mr. Knight. You are trying to compare the connotative definition of &quot;job&quot; with the denotative definition of &quot;job&quot;, when they are not mutually exclusive nor do they need to be mutually inclusive. I apologize that some people like myself know more about linguistics than others and get frustrated when someone clearly is wrong in their argument of their misguided view on said rule of linguistics. <br />
<br />
Taking a part-time job assignment that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks is still just as much of a job as someone working a 9-5 when you take the denotative definition of the word. Arguing whether or not it is a job to you is akin to arguing whether or not (ballet, soccer, football, chess, wrestling, etc) is really a sport or not because you don't consider it to be a sport by your own conditions.<br />
<br />
Wow, that's some of the most boring and self-involved drivel I've just about ever read on these forums. Your desperate need to self-promote didn't even bother to proofread a second paragraph that didn't contradict anything I'd said; and it was just to meaninglessly try and promote an argument you believe you're right about.<br />
<br />
Your entire tone drips of condescension, and hints at an individual who spends precious little time speaking to actual people. Online, it might have come across as clever if it wasn't quite so tragically pitiful.<br />
<br />
You can rub one out over a dictionary if you like. Whatever floats your boat. Meanwhile, everyone else knows that when most people speak about their job, they're speaking about how they make a living.<br />
<br />
Please don't confuse mindless pedantry with meaningful dialogue.<br />
<br />
Nobody is impressed.</div></div><hr />

You are extremely mean; but also really correct imo. People should stop taking this shit seriously already...<br />
<br />
The race sucks, the game is easy as fk and what matters the most is time commitment. Move on and find better hobbies for yourself.</div></div><hr />
