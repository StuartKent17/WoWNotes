<br />
In heroic it is more important to minimize the big incoming raid damage fast than give few selected people a dps increase. Mages should still be spellstealing their share if they react fast enough.</div></div><hr />

I can't tell whether you're being sarcastic or not, but no it totally doesn't. Let me give you an example:<br />
<br />
Let's say we have 5 regular dps specs. One of them can pump 10k dps on a single target while others can do hardly 5k. Then blizzard decides that this certain 10k spec is not good enough and decides to give them an ability that doubles their dps. Now one spec can do 20k and others 5k. For this one encounter, blizzard decides that the former 10k dps spec can't use their imba ability, just to make things less imbalanced. So, one spec does 10k while 4 other specs do 5k. Do you see the problem here?</div></div><hr />

Well I think Val isn't the only thing you have to heal. Seems your healers will have to juggle healing the raid and Val. Two of the adds have AOE abilities so I imagine it's not just about having the highest potential single target HPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this is wrong<br />
on our very first attemps we let shamans purge<br />
<br />
since 3rd kill we only let mages dispell.<br />
and we never ahve more than 3 mages in raid.<br />
2 or 3 IDs we let 1 mage spellsteal everything, that didnt got dispelled by the tanks passive ability<br />
<br />
<br />
it wont oneshot the raid. tankdmg could be much higher, so you have to hurry</div></div><hr />

i concede, my wording was a little off, but the fact remains that enh shamans do not own the fight... my guild does him on heroic 10man with 1 mage spellstealing the buff... and 2 in 25man norm... we dont even have an enh shaman =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
On the PTR, we cast GS on her quite successfully, however, she herself has an effect such that GS can only be cast upon her once every 60 seconds. <br />
<br />
Paladin stacking will not happen for this encounter. The raid takes a reasonably high amount of AoE damage, such that AoE healing abilites are pretty necessary to heal them. Druids can go through to Dream State, pick up the buffs, and get amazingly powerful HOTs to put on both raid and Dragon. The fight has a soft enrage timer in that the adds spawn faster and faster until it is a race to get all the adds tanked/killed/interrupted.If they don't, the raid members begin to die. The only healer I could potentially being left out is a Disc Priest - although we did take one to our attempts, in the end I believe we decided Holy was likely a &quot;better&quot; spec.<br />
<br />
Overall a very fun encounter.</div></div><hr />

Except that shamans will be doing exactly the same as druids, only with half the output... Especially if healers are supposed to move between the clouds. I love seeing encounters that involve coordination and moving, but hate to realize other healers have so much better tools for those things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's say we have 5 regular dps specs. One of them can pump 10k dps on a single target while others can do hardly 5k. Then blizzard decides that this certain 10k spec is not good enough and decides to give them an ability that doubles their dps. Now one spec can do 20k and others 5k. For this one encounter, blizzard decides that the former 10k dps spec can't use their imba ability, just to make things less imbalanced. So, one spec does 10k while 4 other specs do 5k. Do you see the problem here?<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I don't see the problem here. Seeing as the 10K dps in your example will be in your raid group thus making your job easier and your raid's chances of success that much higher.</div></div><hr />

Imagine, just a few tanks like 2-3 and the rest healers. Pop heroism/bloodlust at the start of the fight and zerg heal that boss like crazy! And it will be uber if pallies can use LoH for this fight. If it takes 7ish minutes to down this boss with a standard raid comp, like using around 6 healers. Then using just 2-3 tanks and no dps, you might be able to finish this fight in like a minute or two if your tanks don't get overwhelmed. Not saying most guilds would have enough healers to actually do it like that lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i concede, my wording was a little off, but the fact remains that enh shamans do not own the fight... my guild does him on heroic 10man with 1 mage spellstealing the buff... and 2 in 25man norm... we dont even have an enh shaman =\<br />
<br />
<br />
I forgot that because your 10 man doesn't use a certain class that makes said class not useful at all, your logic is flawless. The fact remains, if there is a Shaman in your raid, Enhancement, Ele, or Resto. They should be purging his buff regardless if there are mages present of not, the objective of any class with abilities like that in such an encounter where there is a ton of damage being tossed around is to reduce said damage, even if that means restricting dps for classes that are already ridiculous (ie mages). As a resto shaman I find myself shocking Vezaxxs Searing Flames, purging Jaraxxus and doing whatever I'd normally do in PvP to minimize damage taken. It's called common sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. they have often more HP<br />
2. there is tier 1 prot talent, increasing the amount healed by LoH<br />
3. It can crit, so it often hits around 40k, while other classes have to hope for a crit to reach 20k<br />
4. Tanks nearly crit for 100k heal (they got 1 talent for 30% higher crits with healing spells and the 5% more heal cast by and 5% on them and imp. dev. aura with +6% heal)<br />
5. it gives an awesome buff on the tank, stacking with inspiration / ancestral shit from shamy</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The portal room is identical to the main room. You can fly in this realm (I didn't notice if there was a buff for this or what have you, you basically hop and then you're up in the air - unmounted of course). Valithiria is standing in this realm. She is surrounded by green orbs that are reasonably far up in the air called Dream Clouds. So basically fly around, kill the little Clouds, get the Emerald Vigor buff (they have a trivial health pool, can be killed with a Holy Nova.)</div></div><hr />

What you say is true, but people have tried zerg methods on bosses before that blizz didn't intend to work but they did anyway.<br />
<br />
If this fight is balanced around 6 or so healers, and the groups I've seen take about 7 minutes to finish the fight. with 23 healers + heroism on pull you might be able to zerg it before the tanks die. Anyone know how much health actually needs to be healed?</div></div><hr />

With 20 paladins thats 440,000 health. Valithria has like, 20 million health that needs to be healed. So 440,000 will barely put a dent in her. One LoH is about equal to a Holy Light crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe if you're in a shitty guild that can't trust members because they fail at personal responsibilities, then you should purge. Me on the other hand, I'd rather have a mage spell steal the buff so he can do amazing dps and the fight can end faster. Especially on heroic when you need dps to focus down adds, portals, and volcanoes quickly. It's honestly not hard to remove his stacks with spell steal on 10 or 25 mans. Even if the mage is slow to getting them off, I mean it's already the easiest fight in the instance on normal and hard modes, so you're probably in no danger.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">G l o w y r m</div><div class="date">2009-10-31, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know what the PORTALS 1, 3, 5, 7 (then 2, 4, 6, 8 ) and set's 1 and 2 strategy means?<br />
<br />
I know it's about going into the portal to get DPS and healers the buff but how does that particular setup work the guy is ordering in raid?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm disc and I do a pretty good job of keeping the tanks topped off and shielded while spot-healing the raid. I think it would be pretty easy to do the same thing ,except throwing the extra heals on Vali.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly, we are NOT tank only healers, that's a HUGE waste of Discipline's versatility and tool set/talents.<br />
<br />
A Disc would be good on this fight to heal many of the add killers/tanks since there is a huge armor debuff from one of them. The tank in the video almost dies many times that fight also, Discipline is all about saving lives.<br />
<br />
Discipline can spam GHeal really fast also on Valithria (even though it will hit for a little less, it will be very fast) and mana efficiency isn't a huge deal with the MP5 buff we get in the portals.<br />
<br />
There's no point in really arguing though, every class will have a niche in this fight, no reason to say, &quot;oh don't bring that guy&quot;.<br />
<br />
More people just need to realize Disciplines uses like many of the progression guilds have. There's usually one in every world 1st and in the videos on MMOChamp (not in this one, in all of the other PTR fights though).</div></div><hr />

Me on the other hand, I'd rather have a mage spell steal the buff so he can do amazing dps and the fight can end faster. Especially on heroic when you need dps to focus down adds, portals, and volcanoes quickly. It's honestly not hard to remove his stacks with spell steal on 10 or 25 mans. Even if the mage is slow to getting them off, I mean it's already the easiest fight in the instance on normal and hard modes, so you're probably in no danger.<br />

<br />
<br />
You have a point. Sorry, I was talking about more along the lines of pugging, and even in guild raids some jackhole dps will get cleaved/stand in fire/pull aggro and die for some retarded reason thus making me or any other healing class who can dispell/purge etc use said abilities.</div></div><hr />

Completely unrelated, but could you post or PM me a list of your addons or the UI you use? It looks to be much better than Spartan UI D:</div></div><hr />

Hmm, every other encounter can't be fun for a frost/fire mage. Just Frostfire Bolt the boss until it's dead.<br />

Ungrateful wench. Hell she one shots all the surviving adds in the room what do you think she could do to the surviving bosses in the instance? *grumble grumble*</div></div><hr />

You can fly in this realm (I didn't notice if there was a buff for this or what have you, you basically hop and then you're up in the air - unmounted of course). Valithiria is standing in this realm. She is surrounded by green orbs that are reasonably far up in the air called Dream Clouds. So basically fly around, kill the little Clouds, get the Emerald Vigor buff (they have a trivial health pool, can be killed with a Holy Nova.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Aww they could've made it a bit more interesting :p Thanks for sharing though ^^</div></div><hr />

Yea that seems to be a stupid ending to the fight, didn't really see a speech or anything in the video.<br />
<br />
At least she leaves a chest behind... Otherwise then we'd have to kill her!</div></div><hr />

I already know it's Feeling Filthy by Diogo do Santos, but it's none of the versions I can find, unless it's far out in the song or something.<br />
<br />
Also, looks to be an interesting fight. Lets just hope there will be enough adds to make it unviable to bring just healers.<br />
<br />
Edit: Nevermind. Found it. For anyone else looking for it; find the version from &quot;This is P**n&quot; (yes, spelled that way), and stay the heck away from the lame radio edit/extended edit.</div></div><hr />

That is why it works. When they are Mind Controlled, they basically count as a raid member.</div></div><hr />
