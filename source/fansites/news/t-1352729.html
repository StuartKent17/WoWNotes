Heroic Garrosh Defeated<br />
The 10 player Heroic Garrosh encounter has been defeated in Asia by 天 啟 (http://www.battlenet.com.cn/wow/zh/guild/%E6%A0%BC%E7%91%9E%E5%A7%86%E5%B7%B4%E6%89%98/%E5%A4%A9_%E5%95%9F/). The group had a 573+ item level, compared to the top US and EU guilds that currently have a 565 item level. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Class Balance Discussion<br />
For discussion: How to solve the problem that most class discussions happen in sequestered class forums, which tend to have an echo chamber? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374977820503465985))<br />
must ask whats good bout discussion? Just lots of opinons?maybe in game sticky so anyone can say what they likehate bout class<br />
Discussions tend to dismantle weak arguments and let stronger ones rise to the top. Discussions are like lists + evolution. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375789098750836736))<br />
Doesn't stop many common opinions in the community that have been dismantled time and time again.<br />
I agree with that, though I think that's a function of online discussion forums typically having rapid turnover. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376879907940220928))<br />
<br />
change the format. and both use formats which generate a lot of traction. Forums are becoming antiquated.<br />
Videos take too long to watch (esp with ads). I don't get the appeal. I like Reddit though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376879259265953792))<br />
<br />
..and that brings it back to my initial problem. The echo chamber argument is pretty weak....<br />
I agree with Lhivera. The echo chamber effect resists debates and encourages brofisting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374988120590020609))<br />
Sounds harsh and elitist, but their progress and experience tells the same story 95% of the time.<br />
But aren't you essentially arguing that the players are usually right? That is by far not the case. They are right... sometimes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375301421307936768))<br />
<br />
Arguments for a real problem and for a bogus problem will look very similar in a brofisting context.<br />
Think of it from our POV, where there are always far more demands from players than the game really needs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375300008917999616))<br />
Separating good arguments from bad is non-trivial, so seeing a healthy debate w/ many POVs can help us make that distinction. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375300274442604544))<br />
<br />
also enforces groupthink around &quot;my class sucks&quot;.<br />
And anyone who intrudes to disagree either &quot;doesn't understand our issues&quot; or is accused of trolling. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374989766439104512))<br />
I'll say it again: You will never get as good feedback as you will get from the class specific forums. Ever.<br />
Not from where I sit. Now it's possible to have healthy debate in class forums, but I rarely see it, and I read a lot of forums. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375301051626172416))<br />
<br />
I think that would just move the echo chamber somewhere else. Vidcast discussion panels with top players/TCs.<br />
It's interesting that panels and podcasts tend to invite dissenting opinions (w/in reason). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374990694126845953))<br />
I think they understand that (softly) competitive structure yields more interesting &amp; informed discussions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374991817923502080))<br />
I disagree that it's the format - more the interaction. If there's more from blues I believe you'd see more healthy discussion<br />
The problem is the developers themselves are very busy and can't afford to spend hours per day in forums. (Twitter is fast.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375299064922771456))<br />
<br />
Why is the echo chamber a problem? Not trying to be sarcastic; trying to understand what alternate state is desired.<br />
We're not saying there aren't class problems, but when everything is portrayed as a crisis, it's hard to know really needs fixing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987254814343168))<br />
The echo chamber effect can also cause thought leaders or eloquent posters to create mountains out of molehills. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987069849731072))<br />
It's nice to get a &quot;um your DPS is fine&quot; dissenting opinion, but those &quot;trolls&quot; get chased out of class-specific threads. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374986958902009856))<br />
you're guilty of this sort over tweets. 'We like where xx is at'. Some weeks later hotfix or minor patch and buffs appear<br />
That is ultimately the system working though. Sometimes players convince us a change is necessary. Other times data prove us wrong. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298834999410688))<br />
<br />
Legitimate contributors are discouraged from posting because of toxic abusive posters. Remove problems, contributors return?<br />
I used to subscribe to that more, but over moderation can also create fear and resentment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374989132977557504))<br />
It's also something we can't enforce on websites other than our own, but conversations certainly take place there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374989208873492480))<br />
<br />
Bold idea: remove class forums. No echo. &quot;Answers/Advice For New Players&quot; can be its own forum instead.<br />
It's not strictly a &quot;class subforum&quot; problem. Even general forums spawn class-specific threads. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374988301255446528))<br />
<br />
And to be clear, I do think that blues should always be very careful when they decide to post in a class forum.<br />
I don't personally post in class forums anymore (or rarely anywhere). It caused more QQ than it solved IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987547690020864))<br />
Even today you see Why didn't we get posts / as many posts / as many substantial posts / more posts b/c our issues are worse? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374987778284462080))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
I should clarify... levelling ONE char was fun. Levelling more in MoP was not.<br />
That's fair criticism. We hoped that choices like Four Winds vs. Krasarang would help the second time around. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377207347505942530))<br />
<br />
I'm wondering, how do you guys consider MOP levelling? A success, failure / could be better? I find it rather boring.<br />
We think it was probably a little slow overall. At launch, you did a bunch of quests and saw the XP bar grow only a little. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377204758127190016))<br />
We buffed the leveling speed a patch or two ago. It feels better now IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377204815471730688))<br />
<br />
can we get option to show rep gain in quest dialog?<br />
We explored this, but many quests offer rep for multiple factions (like e.g. all Alliance cities) and it was really spammy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375303579998765058))<br />
<br />
So you'd rather people get burnt out on gearing, than actually participate because it's fun?<br />
We find most players won't participate in any activity without motivation from rewards that improve power. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379427333305675777))<br />
In fact the opposite can also be true: if we're not careful, players will engage in unfun things just for the power rewards. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379427636377710593))<br />
You mean daily quests?<br />
Or chain running Mechanar. Or farming Sunwell trash. The list goes on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379727121431552000))<br />
<br />
I hate to sound like an echo chamber, but dailies feeling required are why I'm not playing Mists.<br />
I think your information might be fairly old. The new patch has virtually no dailies. It still has a lot to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379724181484478466))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New GPUs from AMD are on the way, so if you are only upgrading your GPU it might be worth it to wait a month or two.<br />
<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/september/ssdgraph2.gif) are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. RAM prices are continuing to climb. <br />
<br />
The Haswell CPUs from Intel are here (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) and they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A) or H90 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Asia is essentially a different race now with the differing lockouts and item levels depending on country. WoWProgress only tracks US/EU in that table, but you can find the Asia race here (http://www.wowprogress.com/pve/asia), minus China.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oratory</div><div class="date">2013-09-29, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Differences in Asia raiding:<br />
<br />
10man is the same as West<br />
25man has a 10% dmg/hp buff to all enemies, and bosses drop higher ilvl than West<br />
10 and 25 do not share a lockout so both raid sizes can be run each week <br />
<br />
So they effectively have 3 additional weeks worth of loot over what we could have by now, in addition to the higher ilvl drops</div></div><hr />

<br />
Items upgrade 4/4<br />
<br />
Because 25 man bosses over there drop items that are already 2/4.</div></div><hr />

They have higher iLVL and more frequent lockouts than the rest of the world. Therefore it wouldn't be fair to include them in the race to world first when they have a clear advantage.<br />

@ Heroes of the Storm. Kind of a bad name choice since it shares the same acronym as Heart of the Swarm. People might get confused and you can't just simply call it HS (since &quot;of&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are normally excluded in acronyms) because people might think you're referring to Hearthstone :P</div></div><hr />

Do they still get the double raid lockouts on this too?<br />
<br />
They don't count because Blizzard has given them separate 25man and 10man lockouts, and their 25man gear is higher iLevel than what the US/EU has access to. They have gear that nobody else could possibly obtain, and have outgeared the 10m version by funnelling 25m gear to their raiders. It's a significant advantage over the raiders in the US and EU, so people have largely discounted it as being a part of the 'race', so to speak.</div></div><hr />

Get over it they had higher ilvl and they killed Garrosh on heroic mode for the first time in the whole world. Thats all that matters. It doesnt mean that they are better than EU/US guilds though they just had gear advantage.</div></div><hr />

Unless you are willing to take this as the &quot;WORLD FIRST&quot; Regardless of gear advantage and raid size you have no choice but to separate the kill's into individual world firsts. You cannot say for 100% if 10 is harder than 25 or if they have it more hard or easy than EU/US, Because of this you must see it as a legit World first or separate all World kills like above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However as far as the world first race goes they will never be given the respect or acknowledgement of skill that comes along with a &quot;world first&quot; end boss kill, due to the tactics used to get the kill. They dont like it, take it up with Blizzard.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard doesnt revert any changes, the top EU/US guilds will respect the asian guilds' boss kills as much as the 25H ICC guilds who switched the Lich King over to 10 man were respected when they got their heroic kill.</div></div><hr />

So method and all the other EU guilds should just not bother since US guilds get an extra day advantage. Also all the Australian guilds shouldn't bother since they don't get the advantage of nice pings. The world first race is over. If Method and Blood Legion want every advantage possible it's their choice to move to asia if they want to.

It's probably because EU/US cried that they had too many modes to run in order to compete. 10man, 25man, normal and heroic also known as ToC. While china likes that hardcore grind every week to maximise on gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, as far as I know, the diffrence between lock-outs is because in Asia poeple pay per time played (not a monthly/quarterly/yearly) subscription. People basically just logged to raid (and only payed for that), not only did they ask for the change but it's also better for Blizzard economically since now they have to log in twice a week (10 man and 25 man) so that means double the play time (meaning double the money). I'm not sure tho, I believe I read about that somewhere. I'm not sure why they have diffrent ilvls tho.<br />
<br />
Also, stop complaining, world first is world first. They did have a better ilvl however fights are harder in asian raids (bosses have 10% more health and do 10% more damage) so it evens out. Also, other guilds (EU and US too) funnel gear into their mains via 25 man raids, it has happened before and it will keep happening.</div></div><hr />

Comparing regions where onw region has 1 lockout per week and shared lockout with a region that has 2 lockouts per week and separate lockout seems fair? Logic.<br />

<br />
you're just incredibly ignorant tbh..<br />
Again, they simply used any advantage they could to defeat the boss. Show me any top guild that doesn't...<br />
<br />
And I already acknowledged how differently things work in different regions. They still killed the boss, did they not?<br />

Stop crying because of how different things are, ffs. What you guys really think is World First is only for the US/EU. Asia may as well not exist...</div></div><hr />

As far as WF's go, Asia does not exist.<br />
<br />
If they released WoW Australia and Australians had a 4000% damage buff would you consider them for world firsts on bosses? Cannot believe there are people on this forum who would. It's a completely different race when one competitor has a huge advantage like Asia has on EU/US. No one is saying they shouldn't have used their advantage, it's just that no one cares about them killing the same boss on a different game.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. If it were reversed and EU/US had double lockouts and asia didn't and a EU/US guild got world first you wouldn't see these people saying, &quot;Sorry, doesn't count, they had an advantage, we need to wait for an asian guild for it to be counted&quot;.

In order for any top raider to get NEAR their ilevel 575 lock even, they would need a Full set of warforged heroic 2/2upgraded gear. Our heroic gear is 566&gt;Hwarforged569&gt;1/2Hwarforged 573&gt;2/2Hwarforged575. No one can get anywhere Near that close for awhile yet.<br />

And I guarantee you if it were between this asian guild, and a guild like Paragon, and Paragon had access to higher ilvl gear you would be crying. That's how things work. The typical guilds get the hate, the underdogs get the love. It has nothing at all to do with anything other than that. There is a simple thing that puts them in another race. They have access to gear that isn't available to anyone else but them. And they couldn't beat the version of the boss tuned for their gear, so they took the easy way out. That's just the facts. They needed a crutch to do it.</div></div><hr />

They killed a boss with the same name, but it's not the boss on which the EU/US teams are working. They also have gear advantages. <br />
<br />
Had it been the same game, same boss stats, same possible gear ilvl, then yes, that would be a valid comparison.</div></div><hr />

Right. My point though is overgearing an encounter makes so many things trivial, so I dont get why people are impressed.

Yeah there is nothing wrong with a EU or US guild getting world second. I'll end up getting world 1000 so I'm not one to talk. And if the top guilds don't like that asia has a slight advantage it's their job to complain about it not ours. It's Blizzards game, they decide the rules. They chose to give them an advantage so we can't complain about an asian guild getting world first. They're not cheating, they're not playing a different game, they're not on another planet like the fanboys in here are laughably going on about.</div></div><hr />

*sigh*<br />
<br />
Why didn't you simply answered that Asia and western cannot competete because WoW is there a different game; but to say something like this is really bad; please keep ethnics outside of mmo-champion!!!<br />
<br />
But yes, We cannot compare asia wow with eu/us-wow: They have a BIIIIIIG difference:<br />
<br />
10 Player and 25 Player are there like in WotLK, and the ilvl-difference is also very big!<br />
<br />
They have<br />
<br />
1.) Different Lockouts on 10 and 25 Player: so they gain far more loot<br />
2.) Higher ilvl: yes the bosses there are also stronger, but maybe not enough<br />
But the BIGGEST difference is:<br />
3.) 25 Player drops higher ilvl than 10 Player. So it is like in WotLK: 10 Player get easily defeated with 25 man gear; because the boss on 10 Player is tuned for the gear that drops in 10 Player-mode; not for items that drops in 25 man.<br />
<br />
So it is a first kill; but asia is not really in direct combat with EU/US. I really hope that blizzard change the problems there so that EU/US can be competitive with asia anymore: if they have higher ilvl; the boss should be more tuned; if they can get loot in 10 and 25 mode<br />
<br />
But the most important thing is: For the first kill blizzard should let them downscale the ilvl of 25 man drops to 10 man drops if they go into 10 man heroic: at least until the competition of the first kill is over.</div></div><hr />

10-25 separate lockouts.<br />
<br />
This means in this same amount of time, they've ran 10 and 25 probably 6 times each. 25 man does have bosses that are 10% stronger, but they beat it in 10 man with the upgraded 25 man gear (which is quite a bit higher in ilvl in Asia). I'll count this as a feat when wearing heroic gear to beat normal becomes a feat.</div></div><hr />

They kiss Method's ass sometimes too. Like when completely ignoring the fact Paragon killed Lei Shen Heroic on 10 man first (and Method and Blood Legion played along with this too by claiming World First and World Second in big noticable numbers, then adding 25 man in much smaller numbers. Very deceptive).<br />

Asain guilds haven't had a significant world first since Yogg Saron, except in Dragon Soul and just now, both of those times they had an advantage that others did not; so, you cannot say that gear doesn't make a difference. It doesn't matter how good of a guild you are, you're going to get beat to a boss kill when someone has significantly greater gear. It's like saying that an Asain guild got world first Ragnaros when they have Dragon Soul gear. While yes, they did get world first, it's just not comparable to non-Asain guilds because their gear was far better. If the Asain guild had killed Heroic Garrosh Hellscream on 25 man, it would have been a different story, but they didn't.</div></div><hr />

How can any of you enlighten people even for a second agree to call an Asian kill on a different client with a different set of rules a World first kill? Plz, stop being anti regions and use your damn head for once. They had access to gear no one else in any other region can, then they used it to kill 10 man HC, which has the same difficult then any other 10 man HC in the world. So let's pretend the immense difference in gear stats doesn't help achieving dps requirements, tank survivability or healing capability needed in some fights and instead let's claim it's lack of EU/US/AU skill to down bosses tuned for those regions with lower ilvs gear.<br />

What I find surprising is that neither 10-man nor 25-man seem to have a net advantage on the other on this race. They pretty much had a similar progression in regard of time of bosses kills.</div></div><hr />

10 man and 25 are on separate lockouts.<br />
<br />
Each one can be done twice a week.<br />
<br />
25 man is tuned 10% harder, but the gear is also quite a bit better.<br />
<br />
This guild fed 25-man gear to the 10 best players, while also getting gear in 10, making it so they didn't just get twice the amount of practice and gear, but four times the amount of practice and gear than any other region in the world. I'm sure that FAR more than makes up for a two day loss on time.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Outplaying&quot; doesn't matter in the race to world firsts. World Firsts are all about exploiting and cheating as much as possible within the allowed limits. If class-stacking, saronite-bombing, LFR-queing Western guilds get recognized for world firsts, then so does killing Garrosh with higher-ilvl items in my book.<br />

<br />
So youre saying if US servers had 3 weeks headstart on the EU servers for example, that would be fine?<br />
<br />
Because thats essentially what this is. Asia has had 3 weeks of extra lock outs. Thats 3 weeks of extra gear.<br />

At these levels gear makes a HUGE difference. Its the difference between hitting the enrage timer, dropping a heals for a DPS etc.<br />

<br />
so, as far as i'm concerned, and yes they killed the boss, but since the difference in acquiring loot, it's not in a world first setting. <br />

<br />
Noone said its a cheat or exploit, nor is it a clever use of game mechanics because its exactly how the system worked in ICC.<br />
<br />
They are given that playstyle because of their gaming culture. Thats fine.<br />
<br />
It just means because their game style is so different and gives a distinct advantage over regular servers, it doesn't count towards the &quot;official&quot; race.<br />
<br />
Its widely accepted by pretty much any ranking website that they are not included. It would be absolutely stupid to include them. It would be like including private servers on the official world first race.</div></div><hr />

I would have considered this a true world first had they stayed in 25man where that extra gear didn't help them beat a under tuned fight. I mean, come on! Anyone thinking this is far is just plain dumb. The fact of the matter is most raiders in the EU/US can't even get to that ilevel unless they are pretty close to being full Heroic Warforged 2/2upgraded gear. You can't even compare a 473average ilevel to EU/US since they won't be able to get anyone that ilevel until very late in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Everyone can declare themselves the winner of the Olympics if they want to, or any competition in fact, but they will be missing the point of competition. A winner in a competition is only the winner if his competitors are convinced he is the better man. I can go on the streets and declare myself best 100m sprinter in the world if I want, but I doubt many (or even ANY) will acknowledge that title unless I beat Bolt's record, on the same terms as how Bolt achieved it.<br />

Pathetic, everyone of them, to give up on H25 to chase a title via such hollow and questionable means only speaks volumes of their unscrupulous character. The only positive I can see is that there are still logical and sensible players in China criticizing their actions on China forums. <br />

None of your examples make any sense at all.<br />

Class stacking on HM Nef was a failure of Blizzard's mechanics, not any sort of exploiting or cheating. They did the boss exactly as he was supposed to be done just with more Druids than most people would think to use.<br />
<br />
Saronite bombs on Lich Kings weren't recognized as a world first. The achievement was stripped from them and they were suspended. <br />

Did they beat the US/EU guilds on the kill? No I dont believe they beat them in anything, they cant beat them with the client Blizz gave to them. . .I dont believe China can ever be considered part of the race to kill anything with EU/US. . .because they have their own set of rules that don't apply to the rest of the world. . <br />
<br />
That being said. . .doesn't change the fact that they still got the world's first kill :/ The race is still on for the rest of the world between EU and US guilds (China will never be part of that race until their lockouts get changed to be the same as the rest of the world)</div></div><hr />

US vs EU start times are taken into consideration with the race. BL also did not raid on Wednesday, the day that EU started, so technically US did wait.<br />
Asia allows 2 different lock outs, 10 man vs 25 man are diff ilvls, and scale as such. Having a 573 ilvl for a fight that is tuned to 560 is pretty much the definition of cheesing a fight. Go do some heroic ToT at 565 and see how easy things feels.</div></div><hr />

A first kill is a first kill, no matter how it came to be. They did nothing that would warrant further scrutiny, it's a legit kill. While it might be under different circumstances than the West raids under, it's still totally legit.</div></div><hr />

You &quot;first is first&quot; people are really just big trolls aren't you? <br />
They are playing a different version of the game so they only got world first on their version. Wowprogress doesn't seperate West/Asia and 25 man/10 man to make their website look better. It also counts the other way around when US/EU gets the kill first they only got it on their version of the game and Asia has nothing to do with that.</div></div><hr />

I don't think most people realise how big gear is when pushing heroic progression kills right when a new tier comes out. The vast majority of people who kill these fights do it while heavily overgearing them, the difference it makes is astounding.</div></div><hr />

No 25m here is balanced around the ilvl and greater gear gain. In asia, they have higher ilvl gear in their 25m and more chances to get tier and trinkets overall. They just geared in 25m than switched and facerolled 10m that is balanced for the lower ilvl gear. Trying to say it is the same as US/EU is completely false.</div></div><hr />

Western 1st 25man<br />
Eastern 1st 10man<br />

<br />
But there aren't world first anymore. If blizzard want to go back to world 1st, they need to change the rules back that everyone get the same ilvl, and at least the loot rules are the same in the first 4 weeks. Or that they downscale it for the first 4 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Asian top guilds, Blizzard have chosen to change the rules there. They felt these changes - separate lockouts for 10/25 man raids, thus enabling more gear; significantly higher item levels in 25 man as well as 8% hit point and damage increases on 25 man bosses to try and offset that - was what their subscribers in Asia wanted. We cannot regard Asian guilds as competing in the same race anymore, even if they did have more difficult bosses in 25 man, there is simply no way to accurately gage whether this brings them to equal footing with other guilds considering their rather large gear advantage (both in ilevels and extra loot from 10 mans). In 10 man the situation is even worse, as their difficulty is the same as for other world guilds, but Asian guilds still have access to higher level loot (and more thereof) and so the fights become significantly easier.<br />
<br />
Asian world first is irrelevant till Blizzard decide to change rules again.</div></div><hr />

Oh, did Mana Flask also rail against the fact that Asian realms get the patch days later than US/EU? Does Mana Flask know that Asian guilds do not get access to PTR and learn the boss fights beforehand like US/EU guilds? They should learn not to spout anything &quot;competitive&quot; as it's just laughable.<br />
<br />
Want to know what's truly competitive? Learn from Riot or Valve and how they handle international competition that makes it fair for everyone all over the world.<br />
<br />
Not saying or ignoring the clear advantage that Asian guilds have this time. But when the West gets an advantage as it always had since previous expansions, it's perfectly fine for Mana Flask as they don't bother to point that.</div></div><hr />

What a silly argument: &quot;It's an Asian world first, but not a world first.&quot; By definition, that's exactly what it is. And it's absolutely legit (unless they were hacking or exploiting some way).<br />
<br />
Nobody is saying they beat it the same way or that it's directly comparable to the NA/EU realms, but at the end of the day, they were the first guild in the world to down Heroic Garrosh... hence, world first.</div></div><hr />

But going by the same logic, wouldn't that make &quot;10-MAN&quot; the *REAL* world first, since they get less Warforged gear?<br />
I see people talking about Method and Blood Legion, but shouldn't we be looking to Paragon then? <br />
<br />
Developers themselves already told us that some fights are harder on 10, some on 25... Sure, 25 is harder to organize, but that is not such a issue for hardcore raiders like them because they play this game like a sports team.<br />
<br />
If we are talking about unfair advantage, so we should consider the 'True race' 10-man SoO...<br />
<br />
---<br />
Small edit: Average ilevel for those raid teams (from WoWProgress)<br />
25 heroic<br />
1st Method: 566,54 (#1 west)<br />
2nd Blood Legion: 565,29 (#3 west)<br />
<br />
10 heroic<br />
1st Paragon: 562,27 (#34 west)<br />
2nd Depraved: 560.27(#97 west)<br />
<br />
There is a clear difference in ilevels between 10-man and 25-man, but the difficult is not meant to be higher in 25... So, wouldn't that be unfair to call a 25 raid team &quot;World First&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

By all means gratz too them but as anyone with a brain knows, this means nothing in the actual world first race.. It's all Method and BL (inb4 some nerd trys to say 10man is relevant.)Killing Herioc garrosh first is relevant no matter the region or raid size they did it first http://www.loyogou.com/game/wow/ladder/worldLadders.html</div></div><hr />

It's hilarious you don't recognize them for beating EU/US in the world first race. People on mmo champ SMH<br />
<br />
Why would we? They took their higher ilevel loot from 25mans and used them to beat 10mans, which is tuned exactly the same way as on EU and US, they have a large gear advantage thanks to their double lockouts and higher ilevel drops in 25man.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have forgotten that Asia's 10man difficulty isn't different than Western's 10 man. Only 25man is more difficult in Asia compared to West. <br />

Incorrect. 25 Normal/Heroic scale higher (and drop higher gear accordingly). 10 Normal/Heroic does not scale higher (and does not drop higher gear). Additionally, they have separate lockouts for 10H/25H (just like ICC).</div></div><hr />

There fights on 10 man are slightly easier than ours (Think Wrath 10/25). Also they can upgrade items 4 times. They also get 2 resets a week. 25 and 10 man don't share lockouts. So imagine in 1 week having done 4(!) weeks of siege. In 2 weeks it's 8 weeks. If a us or eu guild hasn't downed garrosh by 8 weeks then they can talk. Their gear is also 8 ilvls above ours at BiS levels. The avg ilvl of the raid group that killed the boss was 573. Compare this to 561 from blood legion and method. 12 ilvls. A complete tier. Get to 565 and go do tot heroic and watch bosses melt. It's a joke when you out gear the fight by that much.</div></div><hr />

I've got one myself, and it's caused more problems than any other mouse I've owned. The cable on the mouse is rather thin, so it breaks more easily. To combat this, they wrap the thing in mesh, which sucks. After a few months, the cable started developing numerous kinks. That caused the mesh wrap to split partially, which creates more kinks (unless you cut the mesh the rest of the way, which I did, on one occasion). The thin wrap of the mouse cable then splits, wires get exposed, and the mouse stops working.<br />
<br />
I think that whole process took about 6 months to occur, but the mouse luckily comes with a 3-year warranty. I sent it in, got another, but the whole process has almost run its course a second time now (about 5 months since the first replacement). Logitech's pretty receptive to replacements though (they didn't even bother to ask for the broken mouse back), so that's a plus, but the G500's cable is just a big pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, as a moderator: Don't call people trolls.<br />
<br />
Now, as a user:<br />
<br />
A. Asia hasn't counted since the 10/25 split. 4x upgrades, 2x resets, and other factors make the region not comparable to other regions. Is it the world first Garrosh kill? Yes, by definition. However, most people won't consider the boss 'dead' until it is killed on its intended difficulty (without inflated itemlevels).<br />
<br />
B. Every single part of that post is wrong. Korea and Taiwan patch on Wednesdays, like EU. I do not know the patch date for China, but they're wrong on &quot;Asian guilds&quot; for sure. PTR access is available easily, at least for Korean players. They even have their own KR PTR realm.<br />
<br />
Lots of comments going around with people who don't know what they're talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />

Doesn't change the fact that world wide, it was the first guild to kill Garrosh in a legit way... It's Blizzard's World of Warcraft, not someone else modified version of the game. <br />
<br />
Asian realms have slightly different rules, such that really benefit them in getting World First. That doesn't change the fact that <br />
1) They didn't cheat<br />
2) They will be, on record, the first guild to down Garrosh in the whole World. <br />
<br />
Did they have more gear?<br />
Doesnt matter... If it did, them should we consider the world first in West the guild who downs Garrosh with the lowest ilevel? Of course not. <br />
<br />
First is first. <br />
<br />
Is &quot;Western's first&quot; more difficult than World's First? Sure... That's why they should value this title more than World's First. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well we can say for 100% certainty that 25m is 8% harder (in terms of hit points and damage) than 10m. They are raiding like it is WotLK where you would typically see people farming 25m to kill 10m LK because he was easier. They killed the easy mode version of the boss. The end.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You seem to have forgotten that Asia's 10man difficulty isn't different than Western's 10 man. Only 25man is more difficult in Asia compared to West. <br />
<br />
Wait, no. I'm pretty sure you were just 100% ignorant of that fact. <br />
<br />
&quot;A&quot; for effort, I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A&quot; for effort. But When you are consistently farming 25 man for higher ilvl drops (and higher chance of Warforged) and you get double lock outs, how does that not make their version of 10 man easier? Guess you are just 100% ignorant of the fact that gear makes things easier.<br />
<br />
The West hasnt had 12 lock outs yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesn't change the fact that world wide, it was the first guild to kill Garrosh in a legit way... It's Blizzard's World of Warcraft, not someone else modified version of the game. <br />
<br />
Did they have more gear?<br />
Doesnt matter... If it did, them should we consider the world first in West the guild who downs Garrosh with the lowest ilevel? Of course not. <br />
<br />
<br />
Legit way, sure. Asians wanted this game play. They must accept they wont be eligible for these races. Private servers are a modified version of WoW. They dont count.<br />
<br />
Its not only gear. Theyve had essentially 12 weeks of playing this patch where everyone else has had 3. Thats 9 weeks of extra gear. More attempts at each boss getting them on farm making getting to Garrosh easier.<br />
<br />
Congrats on getting the first kill. World First is still yet to be decided.</div></div><hr />

Until asia is playing a different game from the rest of the world, it's stil--- oh wait, they are playing a different game. This is far less comparable to the west than 25 is to 10.<br />

Nope, sorry. World first has already been decided. The term you're looking for is West first. Now if you would like to consider that more important that is your decision. Personally I consider realm first to be more important to me because I'm competing in that. That does not mean I diminish any other guilds hard work and achievements.<br />

1. Using the athletes who cheat analogy doesn't apply here. Those athletes choose to cheat. There is no cheating involved here. Blizzard is giving them an advantage, it is what it is.<br />
<br />
2. They're not playing another game, they are playing a licensed product from Blizzard called World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
3. Also the analogy that others have used of private servers. Again, that is not a licensed Blizzard product and it is considered cheating. You guys really need to work on your analogies. <br />
<br />
What about jamaica competing in the olympics for bobsled? It's not fair that places like russia and canada have easier access to snow and facilities. They have an advantage so would you consider their gold medals cheating? Nah that's a stupid analogy too. We need some analogy masters in here.</div></div><hr />

I would say that this is dependant on what games you are interested in, what settings and at what resolution. Would it handle 25 man heroic raiding as well as the others? Probably not; I'd recommend an i3 from Intel and appropriate motherboard (2000-series use a h60-series motherboard, 3000-series use a h70-series and 4000-series want a h80-series) instead. Make sure it's an mATX motherboard though and you can instead forsake the cooler (hyper 212).<br />

For any other gaming and other raiding in wow, it's very decent at 1680x1050 and below and decent-for-the-budget gaming rig at 1080p :)</div></div><hr />
