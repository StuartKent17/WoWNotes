New Arena Matchmaking System<br />
With the release of patch 3.0.8 we have implemented a new matchmaking system for arenas that will improve the overall system and help ensure that players will be matched against others of equal skill. The new matchmaking system uses a rating that you cannot see, and is separate for each of the arena brackets.<br />
<br />
The rating changes at the end of each match are affected by this new system, and as it just came out, there may initially be some odd behavior in rating changes, but these will straighten out fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
We will monitor this new system and update it as needed to help provide the best experience possible in arena matches. <br />

GM Chat Window Change<br />
We mentionned this feature a few days ago, check the original news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=33167.0) for more details. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/gmchatrequest.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=33167.0)<br />
As part of our ongoing effort to provide the best service and security we possibly can, we have introduced a new Game Master Chat interface!<br />
<br />
Now, when a Game Master contacts you, a special notification will appear in the upper right-hand corner of your screen, just to the left of your standard Mini-Map and above your beneficial Buff bar. The appearance of this notification, known as a “GM Chat Request,” will signal a pending message from a member of our In-Game staff. To access this message, simply click on the GM Chat Request icon and a special chat window will open which will allow you to have a secure conversation with the Game Master in question.<br />
<br />
By default, this window will appear on the left side of your screen, just above the standard location of your primary chat window. This window may be moved around and even closed at will. If closed, the GM chat window may be re-opened at any time by clicking on the “Open GM Chat Log” button, accessed via the In-Game Knowledge Base (the big red “?” icon in navigation tray). With this, should a Game Master send another message after the GM chat window is closed the GM Chat Request icon will again appear in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to view the GM Chat Request icon or GM chat window, we highly recommend that you reset your User Interface (UI) and ensure that all active AddOns are up-to-date. For more information regarding the Reset UI process, please see the following: http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=19379&amp;searchQuery=addons&amp;pageNumber=1 (http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=19379&amp;searchQuery=addons&amp;pageNumber=1)<br />
<br />
With this new interface, it will be easier than ever to talk to one of our staff without the distractions of busy scrolling chat text, and with full confidence that you are indeed in a conversation with a member of our In-Game Support team.<br />
<br />
Should you possess any questions regarding this new feature, however, please do not hesitate to ask.<br />
<br />
Thank you! <br />

A few more undocumented changes ...<br />
A few more undocumented changes from our users, if you spot any please report them in comments. <br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
It seems that the gold dropped by bosses in Zul'gurub and Ahn'qiraj (20 Players) has been reduced by 50%.<br />
Grobbulus clouds are smaller and do less damage. <br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
Gotta Go! - The actual time to complete this achievement has been changed from 2 minutes to 4 minutes as of patch 3.0.8. There is currently a bug though and the text in the achievement window still shows 2 minutes. This will be corrected in a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14496619991-gotta-go.html))<br />
You Don't Have An Eternity (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1874) - Both normal and heroic version of the achievement have been changed to 6 minutes. (Up from 5) The encounter has been changed and made slightly harder, the achievement isn't necessarily easier to obtain. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
No, that's not correct according to worldofraids.com:<br />
<br />
<br />
You Don't Have An Eternity and Heroic: You Don't Have An Eternity were changed in 3.0.8 to read &quot;6 minutes or less&quot; rather than &quot;5 minutes or less.&quot; From the outside, this seems to be a gimping of the achievement. However, there's also been a change to the sparks that spawn during the Malygos encounter. They now despawn after a set duration, so you can no longer hold 3+ sparks in place until the most opportunistic time to kill them and build the stack. Image below, but feel free to share your thoughts on the change in the comments.</div></div><hr />

I really wonder how they manage to break such random things. I'm a software developer, and I understand large systems can be rather complex to maintain and if you tinker with one thing it can affect another, but I really would love to get a peak at their codebase because the things that break are often so random and totally unrelated to the things that where changed.</div></div><hr />

You could cram the raid into a small arch next to the door that leads to the room with the maggots and eyestalks - and you didn't get any dmg from his disease nor from the ground splashes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is totally lame. First I loved her being my weekly fun kill. Even as a lvl 80 enh shaman... she is not a total walk in the park in terms of being easy. I loved getting 150g or more from her. Now its probably 50g or maybe less/more. Not really worth my time now nor anyone else to kill her unless you want the achievement or you are bored.<br />
<br />
Honestly,... the ease of killing them was not something that was really exploited in terms of farming. There are better ways to make gold.. this was just plain fun for many of us old school WoW players.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trouble</div><div class="date">2009-01-21, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3.0.8 Raid Changes (Undocumented) (http://www.tardfactor.com/patches/undocumented-308-raid-changes)<br />
<br />
Excerpt from my post about this:<br />
<br />
As usual, there's undocumented changes in this patch. Most undocumented changes get dug up elsewhere, but raid changes tend to not be found until the patch actually goes live because no one is testing raid content on the PTR unless it's a new zone. Here are the changes, I'll keep this updated with new finds:<br />
<br />
* You Don't Have an Eternity: The timer was increased to 6 minutes but you can only have two sparks at a time. This makes the achievement significantly more difficult just due to DPS requirements. I would say that being overgeared for the encounter is now basically a requirement to get the achievement. I'm not entirely sure feasible the achievement even is now with current gear.<br />
<br />
* Sartharion with Three Drakes: You can no longer remove Twilight Torment as described in The Twilight Torment Dance (http://www.tardfactor.com/strategy/the-twilight-torment-dance). This means you absolutely must handle the huge breaths that can hit for up to 75k with cooldowns. This definitely makes the fight more difficult and places more emphasis on DPS to get Shadron down as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noticed the following from 25man Naxx last night...<br />
<br />
-Grand Widow Faerlina has a Death and Decay style ground effect where her Rain of Fire hits.<br />
-Mage Blizzard has Death and Decay style ground effect, only blue.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if there will be a ground effect for Sapphiron's Blizzard, given the other ground effects that are showing up?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dengril</div><div class="date">2009-01-21, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some changes I've noticed:<br />
<br />
Looting the carrots for the Dalaran cooking daily Sewer Stew takes less time.<br />
<br />
Clicking on the teleportation rune in Dalaran to get down to Crystalsong Forest and back up again has also had its timing reduced.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this has been mentioned elsewhere, I knew it had been talked about in Blue posts, but it appears (at least by testing with my Magnificent Flying Carpet) that the change to mounts as vehicles has been changed and you can now auto-dismount from most mounts (yay!)<br />
<br />
There are also new graphics for Eternal Earth and Crystalline Earth. They now have a yellowish glow and are easier to distinguish from the Air and Shadow elements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the new Rain of Fire and Blizzard effects, RoF has like a little fire explosion and then the DnD ground effect, and Blizzard with this light blue. Warlock's RoF is the same as Faerlinas.</div></div><hr />

While it was annoying I gained like 25k honor and 40 some odd WG marks in a couple hours. For us the bug was &quot;Capture WG, crash Northrend, comes back up and your already in battle now as defender, Horde caps,crash, comes back up as attacking, capture, crash..... It was a Groundhog Day wonderland.<br />

The range on Heigan's Spell Disruption ability has been increased (previously 20 yards, appears to be 25-30 yards now).<br />
<br />
The achievement &quot;Spore Loser&quot; has been fixed and is now attainable.<br />
<br />
The achievement &quot;The Empire of Zul'Drak&quot; has been fixed to allow players that may have missed quests that are no longer attainable, to still receive the achievement.<br />
<br />
Lootable objects that spawn after a boss's death (i.e. Malygos, Four Horsemen) are now instantly lootable.<br />
<br />
The Achievement UI has been enhanced; there is now a dropdown menu that allows you to show only complete or incomplete achievements if you wish. Icons now appear next to achievements that have a &quot;requirements list&quot; that can be shown. You can now click the sub-achievement name under a meta-achievement's requirement list to be taken to the description for that sub-achievement.</div></div><hr />

Also, the achievement UI was changed, the lower half of the summary tab now shows bars for all categories. There is also a new achievement for slaying the scourge invasion boss in kara (awared retroactively through the pet drop).</div></div><hr />

They have been removed. If you were at the correct reputation to get the quintessence in the first place, you've now been given a Feat of Strength: &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. <br />

Netherwing Relic seems to have 100% droprate now, got 10 out of 10 kills..<br />
<br />
<br />
The drop rate has also been increased to 100% on the Fel Glands for A Slow Death. I'm not sure about the total amount but the drop rate on Netherwing Crystals seems to have gotten quite a boost as well. I was able to complete it before Dragons are the Least of Our Problems, only killing those mobs. So less than 20 kills (regularly getting 2 when they would drop).<br />
<br />
There also appears to be a lot more Nethermine Cargo lying around.<br />
<br />
Also, if you use a flying carpet, you will get your normal flying carpet buff and the dragonmaw netherdrake buff. Typically you will remain on your carpet but sometimes you will be posed on top of the Drake as if you were on your flying carpet. Right clicking both buffs in this situation will result in you swimming through the air at epic flight speed. However, most of the time you will remain on your flying carpet and will switch to the Drake if you try to dismount from the carpet.</div></div><hr />

Also, it's been reported that you can see who controls Wintergrasp from other continents. This is only true if you are already in or go to Northrend and then go to a different continent.

Now its probably 50g or maybe less/more. Not really worth my time now nor anyone else to kill her unless you want the achievement or you are bored.<br />
<br />
Honestly,... the ease of killing them was not something that was really exploited in terms of farming. There are better ways to make gold.. this was just plain fun for many of us old school WoW players.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it was just plain fun, then why does it matter how much gold she drops? Sounds to me like the gold is actually more important than you pretend.</div></div><hr />

It gave people a reason to go farm them. To go see some of the content and have fun with it. By reducing the gold, it's only going to cause people to ignore it and they'll just become forgotten zones never seen anymore. So Sad.<br />
<br />
So by disabling Wintergrasp, does that mean that Vault is not available to anyone on either side, or is it fully available to everyone now until they put WG back up?<br />
<br />
BTW, didn't notice much on Malygos last night, we were getting heals through the vortexes (at least it seemed like we did as no one died during it. Not sure about sparks being unrootable, but there wasn't much of an issue keeping them under control.</div></div><hr />

Shadowmeld: This ability will now properly restore threat when it is cancelled. In addition, it will correctly remove a player from combat if it is active when that player is the last person left alive that the creature hates. This ability is now also unusable while affected by Faerie Fire.<br />
<br />
Could that be the problem? I don't know what irregularities you're having but the Faerie Fire might be it?</div></div><hr />

Pre 3.0.8 if you were not facing your target you would get an error message saying 'You must be facing your target' and the cast would fail. Now, the cast will go off instantly and turn you while you channel the spell. This makes Penance much much better as it can be used as an instant heal for anyone, just like it should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you don't feel remorse that the other faction cannot<br />
- get the buff for obtaining the stone shards (and 5% more xp for leveling)<br />
- raid Archavon<br />
- get to the NPC who sells the Wintergrasp stuff, including the brand new PvP epics<br />
<br />
actually, this sucks more than anything, I was so looking forward to get my new PvP items today... damn it blizz, you could at least change control of Wintergrasp manually every 3 hours or something like that, the situation right now is unbearable</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syphilicious</div><div class="date">2009-01-22, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may be the only person that creates lasting emotional attachments to my druid-only quest rewards, since I've kept all of them, but I noticed while digging through my bank that my Aquarius Belt, which used to be a green 40 armor, 2 stam, 2 int belt, is now a blue 49 armor, 6 crit rating, 5 hit rating belt with an on-use effect that heals for 280-360 health with a 5 min cd.<br />
<br />
Guess Blizzard wanted to make the quest worth doing still now that Aquatic Form can be trained. What they did was make an insanely good belt for the level it can be obtained, which may become the 19 twink belt of choice for druids.<br />
<br />
Also, someone mentioned already that Mallet of Zul'Farrak has become an actual blue weapon (with nice stats). Scepter of Celebras has also become a blue caster staff with really nice stats. Makes me wonder if these are still needed for their original purpose, and like the druid belt, are now just congratulatory items for those still willing to do the quests to get them.<br />
<br />
I may test sometime tomorrow if you actually need them to ring the gong/port to inner mara.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things I've noticed :<br />
<br />
Vigilance now has a animation while casting on another target (your target gets what looks like shield wall)<br />
<br />
The Underbelly elixir buff that changes you to a tuskarr looks very different and/or possibly cycles through various ones. I looked like this guy without the ghost effect and slightly more tattoos : http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=26343<br />
<br />
A new NPC has been added in underbelly next to the pier/inn area that fishes. Sebastian Bower : http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=33031<br />
<br />
Campfires no longer require firewood, having 1 cooking skill and a gnomish army knife lets you make campfires anywhere.<br />
<br />
Old-style wrath drake mounts have been redone. The mount points are different, and characters are annoyingly bobbly on them. Additionally my tauren sits crooked on it, and in flight my tauren slowly spins in place then snaps back to the starting position. My netherdrake is unaffected and is back to my flyer of choice.<br />
<br />
You can no longer obtain drakes from normal Occulus, die, change to heroic and zone into heroic with drakes already.<br />
<br />
There is invisible walls preventing you from going on the ledge next to the first boss in Azjol Nerub.<br />
<br />
Mind flay actually targets the face now (i.e. face melting) (mighta been prior, but noticed it very recently).<br />
<br />
You can now fly in certain areas you couldn't before, like the outdoor area right outside the portals in the Nexus.<br />
<br />
Warrior tier 7.5 (valorous - 25man) shoulders have had their lighting fixed and should appear darker and more natural. ( you can see the previous issue with them in the screenshot here : http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=-18 )<br />
<br />
Also there is a bug that prevents me from getting what I want (and win all the rolls) from every instance the first time through. I hope this gets fixed soon.</div></div><hr />

My suggestion is they stop recycling servers and get some new ones to better deal with dc's, all this talk about WG crashing, well every night at raid time instance servers are on the verge of crashing every single night, and their response is, &quot;we are working to resolve this issue&quot; .. well it's been over a month and it's not even partially resolved so gg blizz...
