I think it's about the same as Cata right, 6 dungeons. however 3 are old school which is, ya, kinda lame<br />
<br />
I really don't mind. They are both fan favorites, and the ones we are getting that are new look truly amazing, different from any we have seen so far in terms of atmosphere.<br />

I prefer quality over quantity.</div></div><hr />

Well Skyrim isn't an mmo so I don't see what that has to do with anything. Single player rpgs atm should almost always surpass current mmo's in terms of story and graphics.</div></div><hr />

They'd need to reattach the other 80% of that dungeon they gutted from it in Cata to make it worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe the posts like &quot;rehashed pieces of shit&quot; don't get me wrong new dungeons are great but the new deadmines was my absolute favorite this expansion, it is an amazing dungeon (granted now that i've done it plenty of time i do actually have that bitter &quot;oh boy this one again it will take me forever to get my valor&quot; feeling..but still) I am really looking forward to the revamped scholo and SM. If they actually change the core of the dungeon who cares if the setting is the same? I never understood the anger of the WoW crowd on forums...also baygon..why are you still around? You've been complaining forever now...don't you have other things you want to do?</div></div><hr />

Actually they gutted it to make it shorter for lower level LFD runs like several other dungeons pre-60. As for Troll lore I'd rather a new troll dungeon on Pandaria or something. They are one of the oldest (if not THE oldest) races native to Azeroth. There should be more than what there already is.</div></div><hr />

Hey look. More recycled old dungeons. I think Blizzard is trying their best to make SWTOR look good.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ohshift</div><div class="date">2011-12-30, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets see how many things Blizzard will manage to recycle this patch. It's gonna be a hard work to glue all those ressurections in a Kung fu Panda game. <br />
From the top of my head, i can count four 5mans (one being an exact copy paste from Zul'aman), Onyxia (for the third time), Nefarian and Ragnaros for raid bosses. Then we have Dragonblight being reused not once, but three times (DS and two 5mans), Malygos plataform, two! pseudo lootships and three &quot;inside old god&quot; room (two being in the same raid).<br />
On to Mop we already have a copy pasted SM and a copy pasted Scholomance, but with half the brain required. Lots of work to reach in terms of laziness Blizz! Better star working!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only person who is somewhat tired of trolls. ZG/ZA 2.0 seemed kind of stuck in, much like the whole Argent Tournament and Sunwell. They did get inserted better, with the questline, so there was actually a bit of lore involved isntead of just &quot;oh look, trolls.&quot; While it is nice to have a couple of new 5-mans come out with gear roughly equivalent to the previous raid tier, I would like to see something new. Yes, I realize how long it takes to develop something new. I wouldn't mind seeing pre-60 5-mans get heroic modes, if only because leveling is so fast you might not have run any of those dungeons. Or at least, not as much as those of us who were playing back when that was all. They should be released at the same time as a new raid, as it does allow people who didn't raid the first tier of the expansion to be able to sub in, or PuG the current tier. Raid Finder does alleviate this to some extent, but you could be lucky and competing against a couple, or unlucky and half the raid is rolling on your tier tokens.<br />
<br />
Short and sweet version:<br />
No more trolls. Please. Besides, I think all the troll types are pretty much covered with an instance. Wait, there's the Dark Trolls. Okay one more troll instance.<br />
Release 2-3 new heroics with each raid content patch to more easily allow people to fill holes in gear slots. My warrior likes Single-Minded Fury, but due to the lack of weaponry choices, is stuck with Titan's Grip. DW Frost Death Knights feel my pain as well. (One weapon in all of Firelands, and it was a trash drop. Dragon Soul at least has one on the first boss - and one on the last. The 2 added in the 5-mans helped. Meanwhile, 4 rogue daggers dropped in Firelands. 2 slow, 2 fast. Combat rogues and Enhancement shaman got 2 weapon choices as well.)<br />
I don't mind seeing the classic instances again. Especially since Dungeon Finder means I'll never hear &quot;full on rogues&quot; again. Unless it's a BH class run.</div></div><hr />

most games can make really awesome games for a couple million dollars, and with the player base all buying the game and paying subscriptions, that should make a nice big MMO, not half the content recycled from the biggest MMO in the world. <br />
<br />
if this is the best blizz can do, wonder what diablo looks like. I quit wow, activision-blizzard + warcraft are dead to me. theres games like RIFT, skyrim, SWTOR, GW2 and more to come... WoW is a waste of time and money cataclysm + lack of quality in MOP and I'm sure the next WoW patches (no new raid after 4.3?) ruined this game for me.</div></div><hr />

What makes you believe they will really release 9 dungeons? They could drop some, and bring another patch just containing 2 dungeons and skip a raid for that. I mean not that that ever happened....</div></div><hr />

Well, TBC released with 15 dungeons i believe (with MgT coming later in 2.4), WOTLK released with 12 Dungeons (with ToC, FoS, HoR, PoS coming in later patches). So yeah, why wouldn't i believe MoP will be released with 9 dungeons (or more)?</div></div><hr />

You forgot to count the Cataclysm dungeons. It launched with 9 dungeons, 2 of which were rehashed (Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep). So let's see, the number has been going down from 15, to 12, to 9. I am not very hopeful at all that MoP will launch with 9 dungeons or more. In fact, I'm counting on not seeing more than 7. How many of those are rehashed will remain to be seen, but I think it's clear we're getting fewer dungeons per expansion. Now's the time for Blizzard to turn that around though.</div></div><hr />

Pandaren race was around years before Kung Fu Panda... introduced in Warcraft 3. Blizzard claimed they didn't fit with Burning Crusade, so they waited. Don't ask me HOW they fit more now though...<br />

Do you (I'm using 'you' as a general term) people even bother to do your research before you bitch and moan about stuff you know nothing about?<br />
<br />
There are NINE dungeons currently planned to launch with Mists. That's SIX new dungeons, and then Scholomance + Scarlet Monastery Part A (Graveyard and Cathedral) and Scarlet Monastery B (Library and Armory) as well. The dungeons in this news post are ONLY the ones that have been announced so far. We're not even in alpha, do you really expect Blizzard to have announced and previewed everything already? :/ It's amazing that they have previews of even these ones up yet, seeing how early on it is.<br />
<br />
With that said though, I too would prefer 9 entirely new dungeons, rather than more of the same. While Cataclysm was definitely a good expansion in my book, it still could have been a lot better if it had more NEW content. I've done Deadmines, SFK, ZA and ZG before. I've been to Dragonblight and the Eye of Eternity before. Really. Not interested in doing it AGAIN after I've already sunk a lot of time into it. Mists of Pandaria seems to be following in Cataclysm's footsteps, and that's not something I'm overly happy about :( What happened to launching 14 entirely new dungeons or whatever it was that went with Burning Crusade?<br />
<br />
Although with THAT said, the new dungeons do look incredible. Incredible might even be an understatement. There's so much detail...<br />
<br />
...and they're so shiny O.O</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to look at it from a development standpoint. Rehashing the old dungeons is faster than crafting a new one. So if they can rehash two in the same amount of developer time it takes to craft a new one, I'd rather them do a few rehashes to increase the number of available dungeons in the LFD queue. Everything new is old in a month anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me address it differently.<br />
<br />
I've seen some complaints regarding going to Dragonblight and Northrend, or &quot;what will SM and Scholo have to do with MoP?&quot;. But I don't understand this perspective. My understanding is that it's the World of Warcraft; just because an expansion is focused on a specific area doesn't mean nothing else is going on in the world.<br />
<br />
Looking at the pre-Cata events, didn't it make perfect sense for Thrall to go to Outland? Did anyone say, &quot;Why is Blizzard using Outland for the pre-Cata quests, that's the TBC area?&quot; ... well, probably. But my point is, it made sense.<br />
<br />
We learned a lot about Wyrmrest Temple in Wrath. Alex is there. Chromie is there. Doesn't it makes sense that Deathwing would assail Wyrmrest Temple rather than letting the Aspects choose the site of the battle?<br />
<br />
A lot of people (myself included) expected Grim Batol to play a part in the Deathwing Raid - wouldn't that also be a rehashed element?<br />
<br />
To sum up my point, when you've built up a vast background of questing and story lore (and yes, I'm aware that there is some lolore involved here), why wouldn't you use it? Why should it matter when that content was originally released?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilurm</div><div class="date">2011-12-30, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">by creative do you mean rehashing loads of content and reskinning hundreds of models? j/w. wow is only at the top because it has devoted fans, no matter how weak or underwhelming the content it. the game is addicting, wouldn't you agree? while skyrim may just be a phase, i'm sure wow will lose a lot of people to swtor. i'm very skeptical about mop. i already dissapointed at the hurried up end of cata. soon as the next xpac was introduce, i wasn't so sure blizz was taking a step in the right direction. i mean come on.. pandas? add to the story line and come up with something more interesting. maybe something entirely new?<br />
<br />
Yes it is addicting but why is it? Lineage , Rift , or AoC isn't addicting like WoW is. Why is that? <br />
<br />
Also I remeber back in Wrath that I would see all sort of &quot;next expansion speculation threads&quot; and 60% of them included the pandaren race and I was like &quot;WTF is wrong with you people...Pandaren??? Are you seriously joking me?&quot; But after they trademarked the Mist of Pandaria name and in the months ahead until Blizzcon I actually grew to like them and now there isn't anything I hate about it. Dont know why this is, maybe because of me being a devoted fan or something like that I don't know.</div></div><hr />

When SFK and DM were turning into Heroics, they were updated to fit new Cata lore (Godfrey and Vanessa VanCleef); however, if the boss list for Scholo and SM are accurate, then it seem like they are still set in the Classic timeline. When I first heard about SM, I assumed it would have something to do with Lilian Voss from the Forsaken starting zone, but seeing the Scarlet bosses who should be dead, it looks to me like they just chose names out of a hat to get pushed to lvl 90.</div></div><hr />

Why should it matter when that content was originally released?<br />
<br />
Indeed, there are too many bogus complaints on this forum. Bliz is doing an awesome job, both adding new content and putting older quality content to new use so it doesn't just sit there waiting for the next level 57 alt to run it once or twice on the way to Outland. It's WORLD of Warcraft, so expect it to be used and reused, as appropriate.<br />
<br />
If you haters think WoW is so bad about providing fresh content, maybe you should go back to Everquest or Runescape. Oh wait...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sny</div><div class="date">2011-12-30, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me address it differently.<br />
<br />
I've seen some complaints regarding going to Dragonblight and Northrend, or &quot;what will SM and Scholo have to do with MoP?&quot;. But I don't understand this perspective. My understanding is that it's the World of Warcraft; just because an expansion is focused on a specific area doesn't mean nothing else is going on in the world.<br />
<br />
Looking at the pre-Cata events, didn't it make perfect sense for Thrall to go to Outland? Did anyone say, &quot;Why is Blizzard using Outland for the pre-Cata quests, that's the TBC area?&quot; ... well, probably. But my point is, it made sense.<br />
<br />
We learned a lot about Wyrmrest Temple in Wrath. Alex is there. Chromie is there. Doesn't it makes sense that Deathwing would assail Wyrmrest Temple rather than letting the Aspects choose the site of the battle?<br />
<br />
A lot of people (myself included) expected Grim Batol to play a part in the Deathwing Raid - wouldn't that also be a rehashed element?<br />
<br />
To sum up my point, when you've built up a vast background of questing and story lore (and yes, I'm aware that there is some lolore involved here), why wouldn't you use it? Why should it matter when that content was originally released?<br />
There were design and lore constraints in Cata that made it difficult to include or justify as many new dungeons as there were in the past. It made sense to revisit certain areas because they were part of the evolving storyline and the quests and dungeons reflected that. It remains to be seen if that is the case here, but it seems very unlikely to me that Blizzard will alter these zones in any significant way, let alone connect them with the storyline of MoP.<br />
<br />
For the first time in a long time Blizzard has near complete control of exactly how they want to expand the Warcraft universe, this is entirely to save time and/or money. I think people actually have a valid reason to complain this time, or at least be disappointed, Blizzard has lowered their own expectations.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganush</div><div class="date">2011-12-30, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually wish they would stop making over old dungeons. If they want to update the diffculty for challenge modes, but leave them alone except for maybe removing some trash, that would be great. I'd love to run these as challenge modes for a nostalgia feel, but I really am tired of taking existing environments and putting new bosses in them. It doesn't make me feel nostalgic, it just makes me tire of them that much quicker. I saw Deadmines and SFK enough while I was leveling characters, I just was bored everytime they popped as my random. Quite frankly, 7 new and 2 refreshed dungeons isn't likely to be enough new content in Pandaria to pull back customers in the numbers I feel they will need to. I absolutely hate Dragon Soul and feel it is the laziest last tier of raiding Blizzard has ever produced. I will forgive them if they are trying to get Cata over with and start fresh with MoP, but I will need some refreshing end game content if I'm going to really start to enjoy the game again.<br />
<br />
I truly hope Blizzard decides WoW is worth fighting for, but I do sense they are taking the game in a direction that I'm not going to enjoy enough to keep playing. It has nothing to do with Pandas and Pokemon, I'm actually good with Pandaren and pet battles will be a harmless addition. It's more about quality and quantity of PvE content, which I sense is no longer the main focus of the game. I don't want 5-mans to be eye-gougingly difficult, just make them fun and interesting with a sense of story, and have enough of them that I don't dread every one of them 2 weeks after release. The reality is that Cata severely lowered the amount of new dungeon and raiding content in the game compared to previous expansions. I enjoyed the new dungeons that came with the release, I enjoyed the first tier of raiding as well as FL, but as far as end game content went, that was about it. 4.2 was the worst patch Blizzard ever released under the guise that there would be a lot more smaller patches in Cata. It was a PR spin that they never had intention of living up to. FL was a good tier, but 7 raid bosses felt a little light, especially considering we only got 3 tiers of raiding in Cata, at least the boss mechanics were somewhat creative. Dragon Soul didn't offer me anything new for raid environment, and the bosses were all very simplistic in terms of mechanics. The 3 new dungeons are fine, but again, the re-use of environments, just gives a feeling of been there done that which I can't shake. In total, pretty close to 1/3 of the content in Cata didn't feel new. When people have played a game for years, making them feel like they are doing something new is important. Nostalgia runs are fun once, but after that it just speeds up the feeling of &quot;I don't need to see this place again&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to jump on Blizzard and assume they are just trying to save money and labor by re-using environments, they may truly have thought that they could capitalize on the nostalgia of playing in the environments we played in years ago, but it doesn't work for me, and obviously I'm not alone. At the end of the day, people won't leave the game because they get 12 NEW instances, but people will if they only get 9 and 1/3 of them are remakes. Doesn't seem like a good model to me, even if a lot of people like the remakes.</div></div><hr />

That is just it, no one KNOWs what Blizzard is doing.

Especially the healing aspect of this &quot;expansion&quot; however, it does not mean they do not have some form of a plan with SM and Scholo for MoP. After all, Scholo is just a skip away from the Undercity is it not? SM us across the road from the place! <br />
<br />
The forsaken have been hellbent on reclaiming the land in their name so perhaps that has something to do with it. They want to ramp up the fight between red and blue, so what better way than say &quot;Hey, the undead want to take these two places for them self. Alliance isn't going to like that one bit!&quot; and end up with the alliance charging in to destroy the forsaken and take those locations in the name of the alliance.</div></div><hr />

Are half of you just lurking here to pounce on any MoP news to hate? So according to the replies here, Blizzard will lose 20 customers because apparently the game now caters to moms and kids. Fine...everybody outgrows any computergame at a point. Enjoy.....whatever else you find. Why yes, yes they are. They've had a bitter taste in their mouth from day 1 of MoP being announced and probably will continue to lurk bitching and moaning about it till long after it is released. Why? Probably cause they have nothing better to do because if they actually THINK that the complaints will change anything, I have some great swampland to sell them.</div></div><hr />

It's ridiculously easy for them to do, and would make for a massive pool of potential dungeons for daily heroics and so on.<br />
<br />
But I don't think they should do it IN PLACE OF new content.<br />
<br />
That's the problem, for fans who just don't get it. Rehashing is fine, but to HALVE the total number of dungeons and then make a quarter of those rehashes? That's unacceptable any way you look at it. They maintained twice as many dungeons, with zero rehashes, for the majority of WoW's lifetime (Vanilla, TBC, WotLK). Yet so many fans seem to have decided, &quot;Yeah, it makes sense that they can only give us half as much as before even though they're making ten times as much money. Why? Cause. Stop whining.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lack of content was the major complaint about Cata. To double down on low content in MoP, and this time not even have the flimsy &quot;1-60 revamp&quot; excuse to hide behind? Way to make it obvious you're just milking the cash cow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they made a good game, but quality has been downhill for years. you can say they have more subscriptions, but thats just the snowball rolling downhill. naturally as an MMO gains reputation it grows, this would happen no matter what, but the game could have and should have been so much better. what really happened, was it gained popularity and subscribers and continues to grow naturally, most players are bored or unhappy in game, and still the problem of recycled dungeons persists. that, and 6 months for a content patch for the 10 million player game, also the story makes no sense, where did pandas and pokemon come from? blizzard used to make a good game, but most players will tell you they lost their touch, those good developers retired and we're left with crappy, lazy developers and a greedy company (activision) milking the cow and taking advantage of customers who want a good game, instead they lie to customers, break promises, cancel raid content (abyssal maw, path of titans, n'zoth the old god and other promises) <br />
<br />
<br />
They provide more of it faster than anyone else. People may complain but they still pay to play and as such Blizzard wins and their QQ'ing fails.<br />
<br />
they dont provide more content or faster than anyone. they should because they have the biggest game and biggest budget. the subscription money you invested into wow hoping for new content and fixing broken systems went to other games you will probably never play and their pockets. you paid for empty promises, enjoy your scrapped raid patch 4.1, delayed 4.2 and no new content for a year after 4.3....hope that 1 year of subscription waiting for cataclysm and the 1 year during cataclysm was worth it.<br />
<br />
look at rift for example. it hasnt even been out a year and has more content than wotlk and cataclysm combined, with a fraction of the monthly subscription revenue for development, and the game costs $10-15 unlike warcraft which costs $120 for expansions.<br />
<br />
rift releases content every month, warcraft releases content every 6 months. doesnt sound quicker to me. rift content patches are bigger, more balanced, less buggy and not nerfed as often or completed in a week. rift raids are actually fun too. thats quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
One small point on lore, Blizzard wrote it and owns it. They can do with it as they choose. Oh and it's lore and not real and WoW is a game. I know pretty crazy!<br />
<br />
<br />
spoken like a true blizz fanboy with nothing to offer but yelling at customers. the customers are the reason blizz exists, they make a game for the players, they provide a service. the players are not here to serve blizzard. the warcraft lore in the RTS games is what wow is based off of, that was decent lore, they made wow with it, wow was successful... since they started writing wow's lore the game as been falling apart. wow does not have good lore. blizz can do what they choose with their game and players can do what we choose with our money, find a better game and developer like rift, swtor, guild wars.<br />
<br />
we don't owe blizzard anything, they're making a bad game. new pets come out in blizz store more often than raid content and cost more. MOP isn't an expansion, that expansion content will be buying pets from the blizz store and playing pokemon in game.<br />

Can someone explain to me exactly what 'rehashed' means? To me, Zul'Aman was rehashed, but Zul'Gurub, Shadowfang Keep and Deadmines were revamped, because they were made different, not just re-released.<br />
<br />
rehashed = using the same theme, models, mechanics and map. increasing the level number and damage coefficients.<br />
<br />
revamped = see rehashed. a scapegoat to rehash content. you can substitute models for others, cut half the dungeon bosses out, add a colorful mechanic, but the players who grinded the revamped dungeons the first time years ago are sick of that theme. when you know what to expect from a dungeon before you step foot in it, that dungeon is therefore &quot;stale and recycled&quot;</div></div><hr />

One problem with that: Andorhal was won by the Horde. The Forsaken already have a foothold on both of them being on their lands. The Scarlet Monastery is run by the Scarlet Crusade/Onslaught which has no bearing on the Alliance and the Scholomance was a Necromantic school for the Lich King and Kel'Thuzad. The Alliance has no claim to either except to stamp them out. The Scarlet Crusade/Onslaught is a xenophobic sect of humanity, not Alliance, and are still agressive to the Alliance. The only push-back the Forsaken should see would be from Tirion and the Argent Crusade in Hearthglen.</div></div><hr />
