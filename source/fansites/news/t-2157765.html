I don't know about Elune, but one you defeat Odyn in Halls of Valor talk to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup. Safe to assume somewhere we're going to meet Elune and the knaifu will tell us to ask her a rather interesting question.</div></div><hr />

Right now those items can't be mogged at all and have to be worn in those two weeks instead, still seems like a net improvement.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Making our way to the tomb requires claiming a foothold and fortifying it. Build a base and plan the assault similar to Isle of Quel'danas. Players will be able to choose which buildings to build, allowing them to earn different rewards and change the story. Unlock world quests, rewards, vendors, world bosses. Not a linear progression this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Im curious whats involved.....and why am i picturing garrisons again.</div></div><hr />

Not that I think these things but might as well cover the direction the conversation will head.</div></div><hr />

From what has been said at the Blizzcon panel last year, it will be similar to the Isle of QUel'Danas and Isle of Thunder. But instead of working towards taking areas in a specific order, you instead work towards building these areas, such as a Mage Tower. Perhaps these buildings will give specific buffs once they're completed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the full Blizzcon panel, once the initial questlines for the Legionfall faction are done, you can pick a few different buildings (eventually needing them all). Each building opens up more questlines and world quests on the Broken Shore. They also need to be upgraded, these all take time, and I think Order Hall Resources, which we should be inundated in frankly (I know I am sitting on about 50k right now). It is not until the overall progression of the Legionfall frontline is completed (at the earliest possible time, based on launch), that the Tomb dungeon and raid open, as we can finally assault the Legion's strongest foothold on Azeroth directly. So this all also means that Tomb of Sargeras, while part of 7.2, won't be live right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At some point, Xal'atath says: &quot;Odyn was a great enemy... until his own arrogance proved his undoing. You should ask him if he's considered Loken's final words to him. Go ahead.&quot; which opens the dialogue option to actually ask him about it. The first time I did it I about fell out of my chair laughing.</div></div><hr />
