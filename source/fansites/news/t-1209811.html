The first World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria patch of the year is in development and now available for testing on the Public Test Realms. This patch will include several updates to the ongoing conflict between the Horde and Alliance, the new Brawler’s Guild, Pet Battle improvements, assorted bug fixes, and more. If you'd like to help us test out this patch and provide feedback, you can start by copying your character over to a test realm.

<br />
Note: Features mentioned in the 5.1 Patch Preview may not initially be available on the PTR, and could be included as testing progresses.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft PTR Patch 5.1.0<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
The Pandaren Campaign begins!<br />
<br />
The conflict between the Horde and the Alliance has ignited a new series of daily quests along the shore of the Krasarang Wilds.<br />
Players can visit their faction strongholds in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms to begin the quest to summon their war fleets to the continent of Pandaria. (Please note: The Alliance version of this quest is not yet complete, but will still unlock the new missions and features).<br />
Players will both valiantly defend their faction’s outpost and assault the opposing faction's headquarters.<br />
Two new Reputations have been added: Alliance players can earn reputation with Operation: Shieldwall, while Horde players will curry favor with the Dominance Offensive.<br />
Players can slay rival NPCs and opposing faction players along the shore to earn commissions that can be spent to upgrade their faction's base.<br />
Look for strategic objectives to capture, including graveyards and towers. Commissions can be spent to recruit guards that will help protect this captured territory!<br />
Players who are truly dedicated to their faction can spend their commissions on an item that will give their fellows an extra reputation group quest for the day. Horde players can speak with Ongrom Black Tooth, while Alliance players can contact Proveditor Grantley for details.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet Battles<br />
<br />
A new item has been introduced that can be used to upgrade the quality of Battle Pets: Battle-stones.<br />
<br />
Battle-stones are available in two basic types, general purpose Battle-stones that can be used to upgrade the quality of any pet, and family specific Battle-stones, which can only be used to upgrade pets of a specific pet family.<br />
Battle-stones are available in two qualities: Flawless Battle-stones can upgrade pets directly to Rare quality, while Polished Battle-stones will upgrade a pet to Uncommon quality.<br />
Players will have a very small chance to obtain a general purpose Flawless Battle-stone after winning a match against wild pets; defeating higher level opponents increases the chances of obtaining a stone. These valuable items are not soulbound, and can be sold on the Auction House.<br />
Family specific Flawless Battle-stones can be found in the Sack of Pet Supplies obtained from performing Pet Trainer quests, and are Bind on Pickup.<br />
General purpose Polished Battle-stones can be purchased for 1000 Justice Points.<br />
<br />
Pet Journal<br />
<br />
The quality of each pet is now visible in its slot in the Pet Journal.<br />
Pets can now be filtered by name, type, rarity and level, and filters will remain in place each time the Pet Journal is viewed.<br />
It is now possible to search locations in the Pet Journal. For example, searching “Westfall” will display all the Battle Pets that can be found in Westfall.<br />
<br />
Right clicking a pet's portrait will now offer the option to look it up in the Pet Journal.<br />
Players can now keep up to 650 pets.<br />
Battle Pet tooltips will now display whether a pet is owned, and how many pets of that type are owned.<br />
Pet Quality is now displayed in battles, and will be visible on portraits, names and tooltips.<br />
The level of battle pets in a zone can now be seen on the map, and it’s now possible to see the strength of wild pets relative to your team at a glance.<br />
Backline pets now display debuffs affecting them as well as the remaining duration of these effects.<br />
The experience multiplier obtained by all seven Grand Master pet trainers in Pandaria has been increased to x5 from x3.5.<br />
The experience multiplier obtained by defeating Pet Trainers Julia Stevens, Old Macdonald, Zunta, and Dagra the Fierce has been reduced to x2.5 from x3.5.<br />
Macros have been added that allow for summoning random pets and random favorite pets.<br />
The achievement Taming the World now awards the Safari Hat, which increases pet experience gained from Pet Battles by 10%.<br />
The I Choose You achievement has been added for defeating Zen Master Aki. The reward for this achievement is 3000 gold.<br />
A new Master Pet Tamer offering daily quests has been added to the Darkmoon Faire. Completing quests for the new trainer will offer the chance to acquire a new pet: the Darkmoon Eye.<br />
Two new Battle Pets now roam Darkmoon Island waiting to be caught.<br />
Fixed a bug where the Gazelle would join pet battles.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
A new banner will appear when a player is subjected to an effect that causes them to lose control of their character. The effect that caused the loss of control and remaining duration will be displayed. Configuration options are available in the “Combat” section of the “Interface Options&quot; menu.<br />
A search bar has been added to the mount section of the Mount and Pet Journal.<br />
The Mount and Pet Journal remembers which tab you were last using.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brawler's Guild<br />
<br />
Underground fighting rings have sprung up in Stormwind and Orgrimmar that will give brawlers a chance to earn bragging rights by testing their solo PvE mettle against some of the toughest creatures found in World of Warcraft.<br />
Players will prove their skill, and increase their rank with the Brawler's Guild, as they win matches against some of the most difficult solo encounters in World of Warcraft.<br />
As their Brawler's Guild rank increases, players will unlock additional rewards and activities within the Brawler’s Guild.<br />
Brawlers on a realm will gather together into the blood spattered ring to watch as their peers face down their own opponents. They can watch the battles in progress to learn from hardened Brawler's Guild veterans as they wait for their own turn to fight.<br />
If this is your first night at Brawler's Guild, you have to fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't help but wonder if this attitude ends in the Horde overextending itself and Garrosh being dethroned in part for that.<br />
<br />
Very, very glad for a new World PvP place - we didn't have one in Mists yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardcore progression raiders won't since there's no new raid. But I'm sure a lot of other people will.<br />
<br />
Looks like Blizz is going with a vanilla style patch cycle with lots of little patches between raids. I approve</div></div><hr />

Sounds like that's the ideas. A little like Ahn'Qiraj opening with servers and factions competing to complete their base first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because names mean everything, right?<br />
<br />
It just shows the Alliance is more defensive in their mindset of protecting Pandaria. The Horde are in an aggressive mindset of enslaving the population.<br />

Bias is wonderful, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When there's a new raid and/or dungeons and a daily hub to go with them, plus a bunch of balance changes to test, sure. But with a patch that's probably half that size or less, it shouldn't be much longer than a month.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Yep! That just means Horde will tactically steamroll everything in-story again like they did in ToW with the Alliance having massive casualties and have a small, moral, pyrrhic victory of how &quot;they did the right thing&quot;<br />
<br />
As for the patch update, they usually don't tell you every single thing in the 1st patch note, just stay tuned</div></div><hr />

Sounds nice though, however it almost feels too soon with the amount of stuff I'm currently doing (if there's such a thing as too much). Regarding the notes, they're obviously not final yet - there isn't even any class rebalancing up. Don't worry about missing notes yet :)</div></div><hr />

Players will prove their skill, and increase their rank with the Brawler's Guild, as they win matches against some of the most difficult solo encounters in World of Warcraft.<br />
As their Brawler's Guild rank increases, players will unlock additional rewards and activities within the Brawler’s Guild.<br />
Brawlers on a realm will gather together into the blood spattered ring to watch as their peers face down their own opponents. They can watch the battles in progress to learn from hardened Brawler's Guild veterans as they wait for their own turn to fight.<br />
If this is your first night at Brawler's Guild, you have to fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would be cool if the way to get to the &quot;fighting ring&quot; of which it would be cool if there were multiple, but should be hidden behind something, or in the back of a bar/inn or something. That would add to the RP of it though I do also understand it's an MMO and part of the is Massive.... so I suspect it won't be anything that clever but still am in love with the idea regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You aren't forced to do anything in WoW. If you want to stay &quot;competetive,&quot; or do it for cosmetic awards, these are the hoops you have to jump through. While I do agree that there are a LOT of dailies, no one is forcing you to do them at anything beyond your own leisure. The same goes for world PvP on PvE servers. <br />
<br />
It's annoying; one group of players complains things take no effort to achieve, and then when blizzard listens to them, another group of players complains things take too much work. And THEN you have more people saying &quot;we want it to take effort, just not THAT kind of effort.&quot;That blizzard employees haven't gone insane is nothing short of a miracle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not artificial gating. Development of raids takes a ridiculous amount of time. If they can release a content patch every two months, which 5.1 seems to be, and every other content patch has a raid tier, then it's 4 months between raid tiers, which I feel is a good stretch to have relevant content.<br />
<br />
Did you really expect them to release a raid tier every patch, each patch coming in two months? Even if they have 4 tiers we'd have DS and ICC all over again with a year+ between the last raid tier and the next expansion. Be realistic</div></div><hr />

You have more options for gear other than valor point stuff though. Crafting, heroics, LFR can all give you good enough gear to get into raids. Of course, if you're dedicated to min/maxing, then you are dedicated to filling every slot. And if you're dedicated, you're going to do whatever &quot;mindless&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;tedious&quot; grind that gets in your way.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the system is perfect, but I don't find it to be as terrible as a lot think. You don't even have to hit Exalted for anything and some some things are available at honored.<br />

The more dailies the better. Spare me your nonsense about &quot;competitive.&quot; If you're a competitive raider, then you WANT more hoops to jump so the &quot;scrubs&quot; will end up behind you. It is a far more elegant solution to the conundrum of badge gear than anything previous and if you don't want to put in the time for dailies, then don't competitively raid. And by the way, 3 of the daily factions have no Valor gear, so those are in fact optional. And you know nothing about what the rewards will be from these new dailies and whether they will help you in raiding. If you're a competitive raider, you should be done with the first tier by the time this patch comes out, amirite?</div></div><hr />

But at the same time, 6+ months between raid tiers is just too long.<br />
and thats where they have to find that line of how long to do raid tiers. I also think 5.1 is good in terms of what its supposed to do. What i dont like is being months into raiding in 4.0 and then getting 4.1 and having to still do 4.0 content because 4.1 was just filler because they had to redo firelands for some reason and it wasnt ready. If 4.1 had firelands i wouldnt have unsubbed at the time.<br />
<br />
I think 5.1 is going to be a good patch. While ppl have just started raiding and depending on when 5.1 gets released most of the casual raiders will still be working on normals and the less skilled hardcore raiders will be just dipping into heroic bosses and what 5.1 does is advance the storyline of MoP. Albeit by daily quests which ppl dont like i still think its a good mix of story in a time where ppl are still at the start or mid point of their raiding cycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very, very glad for a new World PvP place - we didn't have one in Mists yet.<br />
<br />
I find the names interesting, I can't help but think that the Alliance mission might be partially aimed by Anduin's beliefs of respecting Pandaria, whereas Garrosh Hellscream (from the datamined VO) seems to be intent on destroying ANYTHING that won't ally themselves with the Horde, including native Pandaren... also, interested in harnessing the Sha for his own weird-ass ideas as opposed to destroying them outright.<br />
<br />
IE: the Alliance may be attempting to defend Pandaria from the Horde? Interesting food for thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The horde fleet are approaching the island in Karasarang from the south, when the view changes to an eastward direction, it shows a massive Kypari tree in the middle of Karasarang itself.<br />
<br />
There are NO Kypari trees in Karasarang, the only visable Kypari tree from that location is the one in dread wastes to the west if the island, this would be behind the camera and not visable at all.<br />
<br />
Looks like someone bodged by taking the pan from the wrong side, flipped the footage and hoped no one would notice the big massive tree that shouldn't exist where it's being shown :/<br />
<br />
I would post it on the EU ptr forums, but they're in read only, as no-ones bothered unlocking them yet &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

People complain when new content isn't coming out fast enough. Then when Blizzard get their shit together and try to release stuff quicker, people complain that it's coming out too fast.<br />

I'm not intrested in pokemon battles at all and I already ignore them.<br />
I just don't like the fact that the devs are caring too much in that side-game, ignoring other huge part of the game that could be fixed, as PvP.<br />
<br />
So Blizzard can play with pokemon after the homework, mkay?</div></div><hr />

It might look like they did alot of pet stuff, because the patchnotes are long, but these are all minor tweaks. most of them together probably didnt even take a day of work.</div></div><hr />

Remember you get double valor points on your alts when you cap on your main, and you get double rep rewards once your main hits revered with the faction in question.<br />
<br />
It's still a LOT of dailies, but that does help.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the names are literal. They are just representative of the ideals and attitudes of each faction. Alliance think of things in terms of protecting themselves and their families / cities and the Horde (Garrosh really) thinks of everything in terms of an attack trying to control every thing.<br />
<br />
Of course, that's just what I think.</div></div><hr />

Once again, Horde dominates (Dominance Offensive)!!<br />
<br />
As an adult human being, I see nothing badass in the Horde name, or wimpy in the Alliance name. I like the name Shieldwall, makes me think of something that would come from Game of Thrones. The horde name is just...expected, at best.</div></div><hr />
