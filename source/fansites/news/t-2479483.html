Patch 8.2 PTR - Pathfinder Part Two Requirements<br />
With the 8.2 PTR we get our first look at the achievement requirements for Battle for Azeorth Pathfinder, Part Two - which will unlock flying!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/bfaPathFinderP2.jpg<br />
<br />
In addition to completing Battle for Azeorth, Pathfinder Part 1 (https://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/12989-battle-for-azeroth-pathfinder-part-one), which can currently be completed on live servers, players will need to reach revered reputation status with two new factions: The Unshackeled (H) / The Akoan (A) and the Rustbolt Resistance. <br />
<br />
Players that unlock flying will also receive the Wonderwing 2.0 mount!<br />
<br />
<br />

Patch 8.2 PTR - Anglers' Water Striders<br />
For those of you who own a water strider mount, you will receive a Anglers' Water Striders (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168416-anglers-water-striders) from Nat Pagle in the mail upon logging in after Patch 8.2 goes live. <br />
<br />
<br />
This new mount equipment can be slotted into your mount equipment slot to let all your mounts walk on water. <br />
Your water strider will no longer be able to walk on water without this slotted.<br />
This item is consumed when you replace it with a new piece of equipment in the mount equipment slot and needs to be purchased and slotted again to gain the effect.<br />
If you own a water strider, you can head to The Anglers in Krasarang Wilds and purchase a new one from Nat Pagle for 40 gold.<br />
Currently, there is no option to purchase this from Nat Pagle in your garrison.<br />
<br />

(95% of the comments I read seem to have no idea that the REASON the water strider is so heavily used is because of the DESIGN of the current content). If the ONLY way to get this item is crafters, expect many, many hundreds of thousands in gold may be wanted... no doubt whomever CAN make this will be trying to clean up.<br />
<br />
Oh, and doing the rep grind would take one to almost the entire zone, so actually no need for those &quot;explore&quot; achievements WHEN one does the grind.</div></div><hr />

The only reason we still have Flying after they tried to remove it, is because their subs plummeted from 11 million to under 4 million in a month when they were caught red handed lying to us, then lied trying to cover those lies. The drop was so bad that they stopped reporting the active numbers.</div></div><hr />

So what you are saying is that we basically had 4 Unique mounts? Ground Mounts, Underwater mounts, Water Walking Mounts and Flying mounts? You know how stupid that sounds. Unique mounts refer to models.</div></div><hr />

The expansion was terrible aside from the raids. That's why the sub count dropped that hard (and make no mistake, I'm a raider and thoroughly enjoyed those raids).</div></div><hr />

Obviously I was referring to Waterwalking.... but you knew that and just felt like being an ass.<br />
<br />
-edit-<br />
<br />
Oh and yes, I have been able to ignore getting dazed on all my toons for quite some time now. There's actually a consumable for those who aren't tanks.... which, funnily enough, worked on all mounts including the water strider and shredder.</div></div><hr />

No, my point is you are bitching about something that only covers a percentage of the new mount equipment system, which is a deliberate misrepresentation so you can bitch.</div></div><hr />

Not at all.<br />
<br />
My Waterstrider can no longer walk on water. What's so hard to grasp there? In other words, if you want your strider to stay functioning as it does currently, you effective ignore the entire new mount equipment system.<br />
<br />
Now, had Blizzard allowed the strider to retain its water walking, but prevent it benefiting from any other equipment (to keep things balanced), then the system as a whole would be much better.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I'm glad. I'm tired of having the water strider being the only option to use. In terms of uniqueness, what's it like one of two that can do something other than riding. Not like the other mounts have anything going for them besides looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
C:Now, had Blizzard allowed the strider to retain its water walking, but prevent it benefiting from any other equipment (to keep things balanced), then the system as a whole would be much better.<br />
<br />
A: Not true, your waterstrider can walk on water just fine, you get a free thingie (+ very cheap &quot;refills&quot;) sent to you in the mail. You choosing not to use this, but take the other bonus effect they add to this system, is your faul if you do.<br />
<br />
B: No, YOU choose to not use any of the additional effects added to the expanding system they worked out for mounts to get cool bonus effects.<br />
<br />
C: Not at all. Them basicly making our &quot;hard work and effort&quot; as everyone keep refering too, unlock the option to buy VERY cheap and easly accessable acount wide water walking for any other mount of out choosing instead of this ugly horrible bug mount is a perfect way to do this.<br />
<br />
And tbh, lets cut the bullsh*t. This is not a &quot;long grind&quot; or &quot;hard work&quot; or &quot;lots of effort&quot; thing at all. Most of you probably didn't even do the real &quot;grind&quot; which wasn't bad to begin with, but used the catch up system that is timwalking badges. And even if you didn't, you've had several years of use of this fuggly thing, which as mentioned before, now gives you an easy way to get said water walking on any other mount.<br />
Not to mention most people don't even need water walking anymore at the point of this unlocking because of flying, and if you need it on alts that can't fly yet, throw 40g at the vendor from your main, and you're good to go. (40g is 1 random treasure chest, or if you're lucky, 1/3rd of a random grey weapon drop)</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'll not re-sub after all. Rep grinds are all well and good for part 1, because you got months before part 2. Considering the multitude of other games coming out around then, I don't want to put in a few hours every day to get that rep. Meh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They claim it's the &quot;middle ground&quot; that worked best between outright buying flying at max level and not having it at all.<br />
<br />
But if it's universally hated (which pathfinder seems to be) why do they insist on keeping it around? Why is there this &quot;we know best!&quot; attitude from Blizzard?<br />
<br />
I was one of those that agreed initially with the Pathfinder being placed in the game. It seemed to be a decent compromise to not flying at all in later expansions or at all throughout the game. Though Blizzard has done what I thought they would do with the Pathfinder in forcing people to stay on the ground longer and to allow for necessity of creating more content than is necessary per expansion. Blizzard got what they wanted from Pathfinder even without outright removing flying from the game altogether. By the time the player gets flying the expansion is near its end, which is the intent or make the latest content non-flying and still getting people to stay on the ground, which is also intended. <br />
<br />
I have to say at this point in this expansion and given the amount of time every single day I spend in the current content. I have finally hit the wall when it comes to wanting to continue without flying. Flying makes alts grinding a whole lot faster as well as farming, both of which are the bulk of my playing time now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, same with me. I had originally planned to get BFA when flight was put in, but reading here and the free weekend has made me realize that everything that made me quit in the first place is still present in the game and not changed. It will be a year since I subbed by the time 8.2 comes out and the longer I am away, the less I feel the urge to play. I'm still enjoying the other games I play, not much reason to switch back.</div></div><hr />

Having to go back several expansions to find the vendor is not, though. Needed to be added to current hub cities in current expansion.<br />

MUCH more curious about the &quot;not dazed&quot; equipment... no doubt this may prove far more valuable until flying is unlocked than water walking. (95% of the comments I read seem to have no idea that the REASON the water strider is so heavily used is because of the DESIGN of the current content). If the ONLY way to get this item is crafters, expect many, many hundreds of thousands in gold may be wanted... no doubt whomever CAN make this will be trying to clean up.<br />
<br />
Oh, and doing the rep grind would take one to almost the entire zone, so actually no need for those &quot;explore&quot; achievements WHEN one does the grind.<br />
<br />
I mean if you're not already daze immune from selecting proper azerite traits...<br />

So what you are saying is that we basically had 4 Unique mounts? Ground Mounts, Underwater mounts, Water Walking Mounts and Flying mounts? You know how stupid that sounds. Unique mounts refer to models.<br />
<br />
Agree with your concept, but you labeled them wrong. Currently we only have 4 to 5 mounts in the game:<br />
<br />
1. Water Walking Mount<br />
2. Herbing Mount<br />
3. Transmog and Repair Mount<br />
4. Vanity Mount (ground)<br />
5. Vanity Mount (flying)<br />
<br />
Since you can only fly in warfront-daily-quest zones, most people don't bother to separate 4 and 5. Once flying is finally put back into the game, ground mounts will be entirely abandoned again.<br />
<br />
The changes in this patch will merge the Water Walking Mount with the Flying Vanity Mount, dropping us down to 3 mounts. And render the Water Walking Mount entirely useless outside of skipping the opening trash in Tol Dagor.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
WoW Community: All but 4 or 5 mounts are completely useless / everyone just uses a water strider all the time<br />
<br />
Also the WoW Community: Thanks Blizz! Now none of my mounts are unique!<br />
<br />
The &quot;also the WoW community&quot; part could be relabeled as &quot;mouth breathers&quot; though.<br />
<br />
And the sky golem and repair mounts are still unique.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It will be nice to be able to actually use one of my hundreds of mounts besides the sky golem the less than 1% of the time I'm not herbing or flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A) It wasn't a month, it was over the course of 6 months<br />
B) It wasn't 11 million it was 10 million, and it wasn't &quot;under 4 million&quot; it was 5.6 million<br />

Even if they have other utility options for you to choose from, it's utility you don't currently have. You're getting something useful that you don't have right now. Period.<br />
<br />
I don't think they are going to do additional mount speed. All the benefits are simple utilities like daze prevention, waterwalking, and a parachute on dismount.<br />
<br />
Most likely you will use water walking until you unlock flying, and then switch to daze protection, IMO. You probably won't feel the need to switch back and forth a lot.</div></div><hr />

why should you choose daze protection when flying ? and why sould you choose anything else than additional mount speed (what btw is also utility) when flying is unlocked ?<br />
<br />
i get that they want you to be able to ride on water with every mount, to be not forced to water strider. this is something i got. what i do not get is what the fuking slot should really be for. they just can say „when you a earned a water strider you get an accountwide buff so every of your mount can water walking“. bam thats it. why that slot stuff ?<br />
