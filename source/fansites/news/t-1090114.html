<br />
Dev Watercooler – Mists of Pandaria Stat Changes<br />
Our recent talent calculator changes led to some players asking questions about how character and item stats were changing, because some spell and talent tooltips suggest that changes are coming. We compiled this list to attempt to explain more of what’s coming in Mists of Pandaria. First of all, please note that we actually aren’t making many stat changes compared to the ones we made in Cataclysm (“armor penetration -- gone!”). Second, the stuff below can get a little technical. If you’re not into the subtle nuance of gear itemization, then don’t worry about it -- you don’t need to be to enjoy the expansion -- but we know there are plenty of you who enjoy some nuts and bolts talk, so here we go.<br />
<br />
Spell Resistance<br />
<br />
Spell resistance is gone. There are no buffs that improve it and there shouldn’t be much, if any, spell resist gear left. We always thought the system was hard to understand and we weren’t getting much gameplay out of it. Now taking a step back, we can imagine how to develop a game where you’d want various forms of resist gear for certain situations and opponents. Resist gear could potentially be interesting, but it isn’t currently in World of Warcraft -- the game has just been moving away from that sort of thing for years.<br />
In the absence of spell resistance, there is no need for spell penetration on gear, so we’ll remove it as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hit and Expertise<br />
<br />
We still think having stats that can be capped is a good game design. Rather than focusing solely on stacking your best stat, you have to decide how valuable it is to hit your target before you go back to stacking your best stat. However, we are making some changes.<br />
Hit and spell hit will no longer be separate stats. The hit stat negates melee miss and spell miss.<br />
Expertise will negate dodge and spell miss, then parry.<br />
Expertise will be listed as a percentage, just like hit, instead of having an intermediary stat. <br />
We are normalizing hit with expertise, so that 1% of each stat will require the same amount of rating.<br />
We are normalizing melee and spell hit, so that spell hit is equal to miss plus dodge.<br />
<br />
Against an equal level creature: 6% spell miss, 3% melee miss, 3% dodge, 3% parry (from the front only), 3% block (from the front only).<br />
Against a +1 level creature: 9% spell miss, 4.5% melee miss, 4.5% dodge, 4.5% parry (from the front only), 4.5% Block (from the front only).<br />
Against a +2 level creature: 12% spell miss, 6% melee miss, 6% dodge, 6% parry (from the front only), 6% Block (from the front only).<br />
Against a +3/boss level creature: 15% spell miss, 7.5% melee miss, 7.5% dodge, 7.5% parry (from the front only), 7.5% block (from the front only).<br />
Ranged attacks will be able to be dodged. Hunters will benefit from expertise and will have it on their gear, which will also allow hunters and Enhancement shaman to share gear more easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Block<br />
<br />
<br />
The chance to block will be handled by a separate combat roll for each attack that is not avoided. In other words, we first determine if an attack misses, or is dodged or parried. If it is not, then the attack has a chance to be blocked.<br />
This gives block a consistent value, regardless of avoidance. Currently block becomes more valuable the more you have.<br />
Block will also have diminishing returns, much like dodge and parry. This doesn’t mean that the value of block will go down as you get more block. It means that it won’t go up by as much when you get more block.<br />
We don’t expect Protection warriors or paladins to get “block capped” other than during temporary effects, such as mastery procs on trinkets. Block tanks will be balanced around this change. Our intent is to make playing block tanks more fun, not to nerf them.<br />
Also notice how Shield Block and Shield of the Righteous have changed in Mists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Criticals<br />
<br />
<br />
All spells and abilities will crit for double damage, baseline. There are a few exceptions where crits can get larger, but the default is x 2.0 for everyone.<br />
This means that Enhancement shaman spells and rogue poisons will crit for double damage. Rogue poisons will also use the melee hit chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resilience<br />
<br />
We are renaming this stat to “Defense (PvP)” or possibly “PvP Defense.” All players will have 30% base Defense, the same way all characters have some base Stamina.<br />
PvP gear will have Defense on it, as well as a new stat, “Power (PvP).” Power increases the damage you do to other players as well as the healing you do to other players in PvP situations.<br />
If you have a lot of Power, you’ll do more damage to other players, but they likely have Defense as well. If you fight players in lots of PvE gear, they’ll take more damage. Likewise, a player in PvE gear won’t have enough Power to effectively penetrate your Defense.<br />
The names PvP Power and PvP Defense may not be final, but we’re leaning towards going with stat names that are obviously PvP-related, rather than “fluffier” names that might not be as easy to grasp. We want it to be clear to players that neither Power nor Defense have any relevance when fighting creatures, such as in dungeons or raids.<br />
PvP gear will be lower in item level than PvE gear of an equivalent tier, however the Power and Defense stats will make sure that PvP gear is more powerful in PvP (both offensively and defensively) than PvE gear. In our budgeting system, the PvP stats will be free rather than causing other stats, such as Strength or haste, to be smaller as a result of including Power or Defense.<br />
The goal of this change is to make it easier for a PvP player to participate in PvE, or for a PvE player to get started in PvP. Currently, we feel it is too large a barrier to go from one to the other, and the result has been that we see more and more players choosing to focus exclusively on only PvP or PvE. In earlier expansions, it was more feasible to use PvE gear in Arenas or Battlegrounds until you acquired the more useful PvP gear. The same was true of being able to use your PvP gear in a dungeon or raid until you acquired something better. In Cataclysm, stepping into PvP with no PvP gear would result in a player being so ineffective that it was difficult to even make progress towards acquiring PvP gear.<br />
For the higher-end of PvP or PvE (say Gladiators or heroic raiders), we believe those players will still gravitate towards the dedicated PvP or PvE gear. It is the players who are working towards those two end games that will benefit more from some cross over.<br />
<br />
<br />
That’s a lot of information, and it probably sounds more set-in-stone than it really is. We’ll continue to iterate as players poke holes in our ideas, tell us what is working out and what isn’t, and finally get to experience it first hand in beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
First European Wave of Diablo III Beta Invites Under Way<br />
Brave heroes, the time has come to arise and answer the summons: the Diablo III beta is upon us here in Europe!<br />
<br />
The first wave of invitations to the European Diablo III beta test is now being delivered. The client is available in English, with German and French becoming available at a later date. In addition to selecting players from those who have opted in (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) via their Battle.net accounts, we’ll also be providing keys through beta promotions and giveaways (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/3389170450?page=1). We welcome those invited to provide feedback (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/forum/2939883/) on the official forums.<br />
<br />
If you have a beta license, you are free to show, share, or talk about any portion of the beta content to which you have access, as this beta test is not confidential.<br />
<br />
As always, we’d like to remind those hoping for an invite to be wary of phishing attempts (http://eu.battle.net/en/security/theft#phishing). If you believe you’ve received an invite to the Diablo III beta test, it’s best to refrain from clicking on any links in the email, and instead log in to your Battle.net account (http://eu.battle.net/account/management/) to see if a Diablo III beta game account has indeed been granted. Or, if you were sent a key, you should attempt to add it manually by going to the Add or Upgrade a Game (http://eu.battle.net/account/management/add-game.html) section of the Battle.net account management page.<br />
<br />
For those who have received an invite to the beta test, we thank you for helping us test out our server stability and hardware. For those of you still hoping for an invite, we wish you the best of luck and hope you’ll keep an eye out for some of the beta-key giveaways and promotions we’ll have right here on the European Diablo III community site.<br />
<br />
For more information, please see the beta opt-in announcement and FAQ (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/blog/2889057).</div></div><hr />

To be fair, it's a boon to ENH shaman. It is frustrating to see so much Crit/Haste gear that is completely useless to us. Crit/Expertise or Haste/expertise can be justified.</div></div><hr />

The change heightens the importance of PVP gear in PVP, but I think we'll see even more PVP gear in PVE with Mists than in Cata, possibly (probably) even more on heals. Tanks still need the defensive (not to be confused with Defense) stats to survive, for the most part. .</div></div><hr />

I think making more item sets, even 5 man level sets will be a good idea in pve to give strict pve'ers an advantage in their half of the game via pve-oriented set bonuses like small stacking power increases.<br />

Mistakes are the only universal form of originality.<br />

It is a good idea and it will be simple to balance. Many great things in any mmo have been due to successes in other areas. The same can be said for other games in relation to wow.</div></div><hr />

It's still a dumb stat, I don't see why they can't just pull it entirely. Instead, I guess it's forced on hunters because it's hard having an agility class that doesn't need it.</div></div><hr />

Because the game is supposed to be self sufficient. It isn't hard to look it up, but you still have to look it up. And understanding of spell penetration based on what you are told in game is incredibly vague.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell resistance is gone. There are no buffs that improve it and there shouldn’t be much, if any, spell resist gear left. We always thought the system was hard to understand and we weren’t getting much gameplay out of it. Now taking a step back, we can imagine how to develop a game where you’d want various forms of resist gear for certain situations and opponents. Resist gear could potentially be interesting, but it isn’t currently in World of Warcraft -- the game has just been moving away from that sort of thing for years.<br />
In the absence of spell resistance, there is no need for spell penetration on gear, so we’ll remove it as well.<br />
<br />
What does it mean for class spells that buff resistances to certain schools of damage, such as Resistance Totem and Prayer of Shadow Protection?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hit and Expertise<br />
<br />
Hit and spell hit will no longer be separate stats. The hit stat negates melee miss and spell miss.<br />
Ranged attacks will be able to be dodged. Hunters will benefit from expertise and will have it on their gear, which will also allow hunters and Enhancement shaman to share gear more easily.<br />
<br />
There is justice for enhance shaman at last! /fist<br />
<br />
<br />
Criticals<br />
<br />
All spells and abilities will crit for double damage, baseline. There are a few exceptions where crits can get larger, but the default is x 2.0 for everyone.<br />
This means that Enhancement shaman spells and rogue poisons will crit for double damage. Rogue poisons will also use the melee hit chance.<br />
<br />
Already known, but good to reaffirm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resilience<br />
<br />
PvP gear will be lower in item level than PvE gear of an equivalent tier, however the Power and Defense stats will make sure that PvP gear is more powerful in PvP (both offensively and defensively) than PvE gear. In our budgeting system, the PvP stats will be free rather than causing other stats, such as Strength or haste, to be smaller as a result of including Power or Defense.<br />
The goal of this change is to make it easier for a PvP player to participate in PvE, or for a PvE player to get started in PvP. Currently, we feel it is too large a barrier to go from one to the other, and the result has been that we see more and more players choosing to focus exclusively on only PvP or PvE. In earlier expansions, it was more feasible to use PvE gear in Arenas or Battlegrounds until you acquired the more useful PvP gear. The same was true of being able to use your PvP gear in a dungeon or raid until you acquired something better. In Cataclysm, stepping into PvP with no PvP gear would result in a player being so ineffective that it was difficult to even make progress towards acquiring PvP gear.<br />
<br />
I agree with having PvP gear having a lower item level, though probably for slightly different reasons. It wasn't as obvious in the starting days of Cataclysm, but now that we're near the end of the expansion it can be seen that having PvP gear higher than their PvE counterparts has been setting up newcomers for failure. Just take a look at some old threads post-4.3 where the poster either wore such gear or had it in their banks and then queued up for LFD. Yeah, not pretty.<br />
<br />
The changes to the way damage and healing work in PvP look promising as well, exactly for the reasons that Blizzard stated. Personally, I haven't seriously played PvP since patch 2.4 because WotLK was stupid and Cataclysm was utterly ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why people get SO OFFENDED about using PVP gear in LFR or dungeons. DPS isn't an issue in those circumstances, and if it is, it's not because someone is wearing a couple pieces of PVP gear... It's because your group is half AFK or just very bad. <br />

They are already giving players a 30% Defense boost baseline. They can always just call it &quot;Damage from players reduced by&quot; and tweak that for all players to lower PvP damage.</div></div><hr />

The PvP stats no longer have any item budget. Ilvl 400 PvP item and ilvl 400 PvE items will have identical stats but PvP gear will also have power and defence ON TOP of all the normal stats on ilvl 400 PvE items. Obviously in this scenario PvP items are superior to PvE items in PvP and identical in PvE, which is why PvP items have lower ilvl than PvE items in MoP. The basic idea here is that PvP items ARE COMPLETELY viable in PvE. PvPer joining looking for raid will have properly itemised gear without trading PvE stats for resilience . Obviously PvPer depending on his gear will have lower ilvl. <br />
<br />
If only people learn to f***** read you would realise the design intention behind this. There is no longer a massive barrier in participation in PvP if you are a PvEer and in PvE if you are a PvPer. Also adding ADDITIONAL stat to something is not dumping down the game no matter how much you try to twist it. The saddest thing about this whole thing is that the same people whining about how simple power and defence sound are people who cannot even read the whole thing and comprehend what the hell it is saying.<br />
<br />
I have to wonder though if commenting and whining about something before reading and trying to understand it is inherent to American culture? <br />
<br />
To sum up my post and what GC has posted. PvE items are not as viable in PvP anymore because no only do you take less damage from players but you also do more damage and healing in dedicated PvE gear, however, the gap is not severe because PvP stats are base stats in MoP. PvP items are now properly itemised for PvE, in fact you should not even call them PvP items, disregard the PvP stats on them because they do not affect itemisation and simply look at ilvl. WoW community is making me really sad and I am sure only a small number of people will even read this post, so whatever.</div></div><hr />

the &quot;kiddy effect&quot; that started post BC. You mean when the game was released right? http://www.hdqr.net/key/images/RM01240_box.jpg Rated 12+, if the game was mature and now 12+ your argument would be valid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, Dragons breath Fire. It adds to the RPG experience to be able to decide to go after specific gear that helps neutralize Fire damage at the expense of your other stats, to make you stronger overall against fighting Dragons. Naturally, it makes for more compelling gameplay as well, as you have points along your gearing scenarios where you get to determine whether or not it's worth it to swap out one more piece of gear, or if the stats on this piece of gear is worth switching compared to the stats on the other piece of gear, etc.<br />
<br />
Many players might complain about farming/grinding resist gear, but I found it practical and compelling from design and game standpoints that, for example, my army of raiders had to spend time and energy learning the secrets of harvesting powerful components in the Molten Core for use in powerful armors that would help us be truly effective against pure fire elemental bosses such as Baron Geddon and, of course, Ragnaros, the Lord of Fire.<br />
<br />
How is it better for an RPG for a player to waltz into somewhere like the Molten Core or Firelands and have the same defense/resistance to the damage from the fist of a giant or the sword of a minion as they have to the flaming death and destruction attacks reigned down on them by the pure living Fire elementals?</div></div><hr />

Usually means I'll need more gear when I restart but even with my nubby toons that I level (mostly thru PvE) and then start in BGs @ level cap - it takes MAYBE 3-4 days of consistent (but not constant) BGs and/or heroics (to convert points) to get the &quot;baseline&quot; set of PvP gear. As much as it might not sound like loads of fun (altho I happen to like it) I just queue thru AV a whole bunch, run some heroics to snag up JPs to convert to HPs and BLAMMO! Only a few days and I'm good to go. I can only imagine the influx of angry tickets and forum posts: &quot;I HATE PVP!!!!! I never did it, so I tried - and all I did was DIE! OMGLOB! WUT I GUNNA DOES?!&quot; Or something along those lines...OH SHIT! No pvp gear? Well then you might just die a lot...IN THE BEGINNING. What the hell ever happened to patience? While I can see a benefit to making the starting blocks of PvP a bit more survivable - I personally don't feel like it's much of a task to begin with and I'm not even CLOSE to being great in PvP - middle of the playing field at best. I do however like the changes they're making to some of the stats - and separating the field even more between pvp/pve gear. Nothing angers me more than seeing some turd paladin or warrior running around in pvp gear claiming their higher stamina (and some people even still say their resilience) keeps them from taking much damage...and then they get 2-shot and then go blaming me (the healer) telling me I suck when they have no pve avoidance stats. The finger can be pointed in the other direction as well, moreso in smaller BGs, when important roles (healers) have no resil - and just get rogued to death every 2 seconds. Now if only they'd come up with some sort of...practice BGs or something - and force nubs to participate in those before letting them into the REAL ones. It's so bad when you get into a BG group with 13/15 people that have NO effing clue what they're supposed to do...so you try and guide them along - and they don't listen and just sit there and tell you to STFU - and then blame everyone else when your faction loses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, Dragons breath Fire. It adds to the RPG experience to be able to decide to go after specific gear that helps neutralize Fire damage at the expense of your other stats, to make you stronger overall against fighting Dragons. Naturally, it makes for more compelling gameplay as well, as you have points along your gearing scenarios where you get to determine whether or not it's worth it to swap out one more piece of gear, or if the stats on this piece of gear is worth switching compared to the stats on the other piece of gear, etc.<br />
<br />
Many players might complain about farming/grinding resist gear, but I found it practical and compelling from design and game standpoints that, for example, my army of raiders had to spend time and energy learning the secrets of harvesting powerful components in the Molten Core for use in powerful armors that would help us be truly effective against pure fire elemental bosses such as Baron Geddon and, of course, Ragnaros, the Lord of Fire.<br />
<br />
How is it better for an RPG for a player to waltz into somewhere like the Molten Core or Firelands and have the same defense/resistance to the damage from the fist of a giant or the sword of a minion as they have to the flaming death and destruction attacks reigned down on them by the pure living Fire elementals?<br />

Equal hit for melee and casters is a good idea, and so is the x2 critical hits. <br />
Expertise for hunter is also good, though i question the effectiveness of expertise if it only affects block which is only applied infront of the boss. Stack 0 expertise hunters behind with melee... Then again a block is only -30% damage, no comparaison with a dodge (-100% damage) in anyway. <br />

The PvP stats no longer have any item budget. Ilvl 400 PvP item and ilvl 400 PvE items will have identical stats but PvP gear will also have power and defence ON TOP of all the normal stats on ilvl 400 PvE items. Obviously in this scenario PvP items are superior to PvE items in PvP and identical in PvE, which is why PvP items have lower ilvl than PvE items in MoP. The basic idea here is that PvP items ARE COMPLETELY viable in PvE. PvPer joining looking for raid will have properly itemised gear without trading PvE stats for resilience . Obviously PvPer depending on his gear will have lower ilvl. <br />
<br />
If only people learn to f***** read you would realise the design intention behind this. There is no longer a massive barrier in participation in PvP if you are a PvEer and in PvE if you are a PvPer. Also adding ADDITIONAL stat to something is not dumping down the game no matter how much you try to twist it. The saddest thing about this whole thing is that the same people whining about how simple power and defence sound are people who cannot even read the whole thing and comprehend what the hell it is saying.<br />
<br />
I have to wonder though if commenting and whining about something before reading and trying to understand it is inherent to American culture? <br />
<br />
To sum up my post and what GC has posted. PvE items are not as viable in PvP anymore because no only do you take less damage from players but you also do more damage and healing in dedicated PvE gear, however, the gap is not severe because PvP stats are base stats in MoP. PvP items are now properly itemised for PvE, in fact you should not even call them PvP items, disregard the PvP stats on them because they do not affect itemisation and simply look at ilvl. WoW community is making me really sad and I am sure only a small number of people will even read this post, so whatever.<br />
<br />
well said. Couldn't have summed it up any better. I personally love the change and it won't in any way affect hardcore raiders. This change makes gearing up alts to get to the required ilvl for lfr a little faster and ensures that when they join the lfr in &quot;pvp gear&quot; they are not gimping the raid. It also makes a RL's life easier when he is trying to form a pug, since now ppl can't cheat the ilvl system.</div></div><hr />

If you think a second, it's easy to understand why you can't do this: You can buy exactly the piece you need for PvP gear, while with PvE gear you have to hope for a drop. One is practically guaranteed, while the other... RNG.</div></div><hr />

Guild wars 2 is doing the same thing, giving seemingly OP abilities at the cost of streamlining stats, for example in GW2 you get a shield great now you have a shield! Though it doesn't give you more defense but Necromancers have 6 pets.<br />

Eh its underused, annoying and didn't scale well. They could have kept it and i don't think anyone would have cared though crafting the gear instead of having to grind the gear would be the way to go imo, spending a crazy amount of time farming a old raid/instance for gear your gonna use once? kinda a dumb idea at the start. Plus its a stat that may have worked 7 years ago but is rarely seen nowadays.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard have been copy-pasting since WarhammerCraft: Orcs and Humans, nothing new and it's not necessarily a bad thing. I like Blizzard's spin on 40K, for one.<br />

A little more on topic: Won't the &quot;power&quot; and &quot;defense&quot; stats cancel each other out in a PVP situation?

Well if only a ton of people would not bitch about that stat in Swtor beeing total crap lol<br />
Tho the 30% base defense sounds good, tho since they want a clear seperation from PvP and PvE gear now, the bonus PvP Power and Defense u get from gear needs to be pretty big, else high end raid gear would get the edge once again. So in the end a fresh lvl 90 player with no PvP gear will still get gimped really hard by geared players, so that entry barrier will still be there, nothing really changed.Wonder how this will turn out.</div></div><hr />

Yes that's what they mean but when the current PvP gear iLvl is at 100 the current PvE gear will be at 110+, so you will have less basic stats but it will be made up from having the PvP Power/Defense.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed when this game was unique and many different areas for specific classes and specs, but as they said in the past years they've gone away from that. Resistance gear was great for fights, yes you had to farm for certain things in order to do boss encounters not simply hit the LFR button or join a guild.... there is a reason in the quarter they should have seen some growth they still lost subscribers (myself included). This game will never be what it was. Call me nostalgic for a game that actually made you earn stuff but once you start handing things to players, its a slippery slope to a simpler game.

You don't deserve the right to complain about this. You only have to roll against mail classes. There's only 2 of those.

Now if we can only get them to make it so that those pvp guys arent using pvp gear to get into LFR and heroics I would be a happy camper, especially now that their stats will be utterly useless in pve.<br />
<br />
Currently in heroics or lfr dps is not a problem even if you're pvp geared so it's a non issue. If someone is doing crappy dps in full pvp gear it is more likely because he does not pve regularly and can not keep up a priority rotation rather than a gear issue. <br />
<br />
Besides if you read very carefully the whole statement some of this changes are to make it easier to transition from pve to pvp if you feel like doing both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish they'd get rid of hit and expertise as well, they're useless stats that just make people think for 15 seconds before a reforge/gemming, again no interesting gameplay mechanics here.<br />
<br />
Almost all the stats should have some kind of emphasis on changing your abilities for the better, not just making them work in general. Haste is fun, crit is fun, Armor Pen was fun, hit, expertise, spell pen and resistance is not really fun.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see resistance fights in a PVE setting again, but it's not viable to do them through gearing everyone in your raid(waste of dev time, waste of VP/JP, waste of bank space, etc) and just gearing a tank or a warlock(ssc leotheras) is not that interesting for the rest of the raid and puts more emphasis on the one player, which is not fun for anyone else and arguably not fun for the resist tank either.<br />
<br />
I'm all for simplifying the game because it's already simple regardless of mathematical nuances, people can go to a source of information that is calculated by someone else, there's no need for the middle man to do the math, it just wastes peoples time and wastes development time balancing these archaic stats. I had fun in vanilla when it was complicated but it made it less accessible most of the time when dealing with a fellow raider who was not inclined to learn what stats were best, other people would just tell them what to do, and again, no thought required.<br />
<br />
TL:DR Complicated stats are a waste of time if they don't do anything to make your abilities more interesting or work better, simplifying the game stats lets people play the game faster and with less thought, which lets Blizzard (hopefully) put more effort into designing fun encounters instead of screwing with stat weights every expansion and every tier.</div></div><hr />

.<br />

Block will also have diminishing returns, much like dodge and parry. This doesn’t mean that the value of block will go down as you get more block. It means that it won’t go up by as much when you get more block.<br />

This change just bugs me, I really don't enjoy the idea of a design philosophy in which shield tanks become the b1tch of Spike RNG, I thought we learned through Blood DKs that tanking under constant fear of spikes is not fun.<br />
<br />
This essentially turns a warrior/paladin tank avoidance model into that of the Blood DK avoidance model, with the difference being that the blood DK has a 100% chance to proc a Bone Shield charge on a unavoided hit, whereas shield masteries would leave us wide open to the chance of sudden unmitigated hits, back to back. A blood DK can observe and react to the seldom event of all his 6 Bone Shield charges running out, and prepare a CD accordingly. A warrior or paladin on the other hand would constantly have to worry about the possibility of being chain-hit spiked, that doesn't make shield tanking more fun in my book.<br />
<br />
It would make more sense to have the new shield block design mitigate the damage of all unavoided hits by a small base % at first, maybe starting at 10% and then slowly rising by warrior/paladin masteries, for a small but reliable last line of defense against unavoided hits. Either that or warriors or paladins will need a large ammount of armor to compensate for RNG vulnerability.<br />

This essentially turns a warrior/paladin tank avoidance model into that of the Blood DK avoidance model, with the difference being that the blood DK has a 100% chance to proc a Bone Shield charge on a unavoided hit, whereas shield masteries would leave us wide open to the chance of sudden unmitigated hits, back to back. A blood DK can observe and react to the seldom event of all his 6 Bone Shield charges running out, and prepare a CD accordingly. A warrior or paladin on the other hand would constantly have to worry about the possibility of being chain-hit spiked, that doesn't make shield tanking more fun in my book.<br />
<br />
It would make more sense to have the new shield block design mitigate the damage of all unavoided hits by a small base % at first, maybe starting at 10% and then slowly rising by warrior/paladin masteries, for a small but reliable last line of defense against unavoided hits. Either that or warriors or paladins will need a large ammount of armor to compensate for RNG vulnerability.<br />
<br />
This hasty and sloppy design has GC fingerprints all over it.<br />
<br />
I guess the part where he said &quot;block tanks will be designed to handle damage taken under this new model&quot; (paraphrased, of course, but said more simply for you to understand) was lost on you?<br />
<br />
And, wait, this is still not even Alpha? Shit's gonna change.<br />
<br />
Why do people complain so much? They're just throwing out INITIAL ideas. Jesus fucking Christ, get a grip.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't so bad for someone with many alts (who knows how to play his/her toons) who used to gear to bolster ilevel to get in those quicker, such as myself.<br />

God, grinding quests and normal-LFDs on my *first* 85 was agonizing enough (thanks random drops!) that I didn't want to do it on all 5 of my alts.<br />

While I understand where they're coming from (if this is actually part of their intention [could also be an oversight, ya never know till they say]), it does also negatively affect people who know how to play their alts.<br />

Well, honestly, if you're on a PvP server...you should probably quest in your PvP gear. I mean, sure, you *might* kill things a tad bit slower, but hey...you won't get ganked?<br />
<br />
And if you're not on a PvP server, and you're flagged and getting ganked...well...GTFO.</div></div><hr />

The equivalent tier PvE gear will have higher stat allocation due to higher ilvl, so you will have better stats and possibly even more health that PvP geared person. Your primary stats will be superior. This will somewhat help to make up for the lack of defence and power.</div></div><hr />

You don't seem to understand what it means that these initial ideas we're posted by Greg Street, a man who's proven himself notoriously incapable of implementing one new gameplay change without first stumbling and tripping over two in the process.

Awesome. Goodbye to the days of seeing people queuing for dungeons and LFR with PvP gear!<br />
<br />
<br />
You should reread the post. <br />
<br />
&quot;PvP gear will be lower in item level than PvE gear of an equivalent tier, however the Power and Defense stats will make sure that PvP gear is more powerful in PvP (both offensively and defensively) than PvE gear. In our budgeting system, the PvP stats will be free rather than causing other stats, such as Strength or haste, to be smaller as a result of including Power or Defense.&quot;<br />
<br />
It says that pvp gear will be of a lower item level than the same tier of pve gear, but the pvp stats will not count towards the itemization of that gear. Basically it means that ilvl 500 pve gear and ilvl 500 pvp gear will both have the same pve stats, but while the highest attainable level for pve gear will be (for example) 600, the pvp equivalent will be 580.</div></div><hr />

And this, here, is the only valid concern anyone has expressed. It should work fine PvE to PvP (base resilience; if you want to PvP, earn the gear. PvE gear will help, but not optimal), but it really doesn't seem to work in reverse (PvP gear = useless stats to PvE encounters, plus lower item level = less stats; mind you, the new &quot;PvP only stats&quot; don't seem to count towards item budget, therefore PvP gear has less sta/str/agi/int than &quot;equal tier&quot; PvE gear, but the &quot;PvP only stats&quot; are supposed to make up for that difference)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sense that the PVP gear will be mostly viable for same tier dungeons and not so much raid. I'm sure Blizz doesn't want people just getting a PvP set and not even bothering with the PVE set, instead..I am under the assumption that they are making this change so that PVP players won't automatically get the boot as soon as they que into a 5 man just because of what they are wearing. (now of course it will inevitably still happen &quot;ew why are you wearing pvp gear&quot;) but maybe for some it will make for an easier transition.<br />
<br />
Now personally, I've never had this problem, but I think what most of us on the forums are doing is pretending like our own personal experiences speak for everyone in the game, which is absolutely not true. This game is played in a million different ways and if Blizzard has noticed it enough to want to make a leap like this then I say we should at the very least show a little bit of faith that they know what they are getting into. This company receives feedback daily for the past several years and I think it's very safe to say they are doing everything they do out of the best interest of the game, and not trying to sabotage it. <br />
<br />
Then again maybe I just enjoy the game and am just glad it's still moving forward.</div></div><hr />

These already work like that. I don't understand why they're listed as changes. Sure it's 30ish exp rating per expertise but it's 4 expertise per 1%...so they both work out to ~120 per 1%<br />
<br />
I was wondering the same, while hit rating gives slightly higher returns for spellcasting, it wasn't worded as being seperate melee hit or spell hit on gear. My guess is that their core intent was simply to bring the spellhit requirement to same ammount of rating needed as melee needed with hit rating and expertise rating combined.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're still lost. You're still going to whine, cry, and fret over changes that you aren't even 99% sure will happen.<br />

Players WILL STILL run into PvP environment with inappropriate gear. Nothing will change that. So I don't get how making PVP more punishing to new players and giving more skilled players an advantage will allow people to switch from PvE to PvP, it's still the same, except that resilience has value in PVE. Giving a number no value beyond what it is for? What so now, (H) Sword of Truth from Panda Raid Boss 6, will have 600 &quot;Power&quot; along with base stats, as the 600 has no value in PvE? Coinciding with Rating 2400 + 2Hand Great Sword of Face Cleave, having slightly less stats then the previous sword but a decent sub if you can't get the PvE BIS. That is exactly what this itemization is turning into. The game is devolving because 90% is gibberish, the average player is aware of stat weights, but might not do a lot or care enough, to do homework. They just want to smash face and get rich quick. This game is changing into a more engaging slot machine with more button pushes. Depends, but I'm more then likely done with the game. Sorry the game is devolving so most of the people can play with an ease of understanding. Yet, that was I liked about Vanilla, it was stat weights were confusing as all hell, the fun, was figuring out how to do it right.</div></div><hr />

The goal of this change is to make it easier for a PvP player to participate in PvE Seems like it's harder for a PvP player to participate in PvE with those changes.. Can't see how the new PvP gear will be helpful in PvE at all o.O Less stats that help in PvE, more junk that only affects PvP.It seems to me that using PvP gear in PvE will be at worst about as effective as it is now, likely more effective because these days you have resil that takes up an entire stat. Now the item will be slightly lower ilvl but you'll get full PvE stats plus defense and power for PvP purposes.</div></div><hr />

Now instead of just resilience you need 2 stats to be successful or you will just get beat up and not be able to do any damage. The same goes for PvP players hoping to get into PvE since they will be undergeared. I like that the PvP gear will have lower ilvl even with the PvP stats not contributing to it to hopefully prevent exploiting LFD/LFR queue requirements.<br />
<br />
Also do hunter abilities use &quot;spell hit?&quot; Because currently we cant be dodged or parried and require much less hit to be capped than spellcasters. Well probably see a bunch of experience on all of our mail gear anyway because of shamans but it is going to be a pain to have another stat that can be capped. I mean they get rid of defense rating because it was too hard on tanks but they make 2 capped stats for dps? At least theres reforging.</div></div><hr />

First, the new hit/expertise make now more sense; also spell hit is gone as a separate table so no more 17% spell hit on a melee char (which has always bugged me, not because it was required for assa, but because it ended to be too powerful like in TBC where we were going all hit rating). Second, crit has become a lot more valuable. Sure, it needs to be balanced but now crits seems bringing their weight to the table (finally, everyone whio things about rogues, the first things that comes in mind are big crits). Also i like a lot the new PvP stat system: - PvP ilvl lower than PvE: ilvl doesn't mean nothing in PvP since it's already tiered gear and you don't need a minimum of it to get into bg/arenas (well, more or less :D), while this way you will need to do AT LEAST SOME PvE to get enough gear and get into higher level dungeons - PvP stats will be free budget-side: since they're lower in ilvl, it's correct to not nerf the base stats beacuse they're pvp items. - &quot;but it's easier to go PvE to PvP than PvP to PvE!!&quot;: yes it is. and it should forever be. it's not beacuse PvP counts less, but it's beacuse while for PvE gear you have to actually beat the encounter, hope for the item drop and win the roll, in PvP winning or losing it's the same, you only get awarded more or less ponts and the only thing that changes is the time neede to get a piece; get a couple of BoE from AH and you're fine.</div></div><hr />

The problem? PvP guys don't need to swap gear to do PvE.<br />
<br />
This is such a minor issue, you should be wearing pvp gear when you are doing dailies anyways. Not like you need all that extra hit rating and if you play on a pvp server and are in a highly populated zone (current daily zone) you should be treating it as a possible battleground. Please don't let the minor issue of &quot;you might not benefit from using your hard mode raiding gear when doing dailies&quot; take away from the otherwise positive changes.</div></div><hr />

Take a ring with agi/stam + mastery/hit<br />
<br />
Hunter/sham/rogue/feral dps (monk) - 8 specs (10 with monk)<br />
then feral tank = 9 total specs<br />
<br />
Your str ring only accommodates 8 different specs<br />
<br />
In a 25man raid theres usually at least 2 hunters and probably an enh sham which is 3-4 ppl.<br />
1 of each plate dps + 1 extra if you dont have enough ferals or rogues - 3-4 ppl<br />
<br />
So really unless you are stacking armor types in your raid because you cant balance it the number of people to share loot with is the same.</div></div><hr />

glad they took what swtor did with this new pvp stat thing. in swtor the pvp stat increases dmg given and decreases dmg taken. much better here with it being 2 stats though, will make FC much easier to gear imo<br />

Not saying that this system is already as old as WoW itself, but it was already used in Lineage II, like 6 years ago.<br />

Because the game is supposed to be self sufficient. It isn't hard to look it up, but you still have to look it up. And understanding of spell penetration based on what you are told in game is incredibly vague.<br />
<br />
Why do you care? It wont affect people, who use addons to reforge their gear, nor will it affect your dps, since your class will be balanced with expertise in mind.<br />

The argument that the &quot;barrier&quot; for entry between pvp and pve is also overstated, as there is a conversion system from honor/conq to JP/VP and vice versa, as well as the fact that pvp gear is viable in 5 mans and pve gear is viable, if not optimal, for a lot of dps classes in battlegrounds (not tanks/certain healers). Also, pve trinkets are often BiS pvp gear. <br />
<br />
What they could do it for resilience to apply a modifier to all incoming player effects, meaning reducing damage taken but also reduce the healing taken from external healers by a certain amount. Either that would work globally, or is enabled only for pve fights.. meaning either way no pve player is going to want resilience in a raid if its going to nerf their healers. Even if it were to reduce healing within arenas (which it could be disabled and healing is as-normal), its still preferable to pve gear as it would not reduce self-healing numbers, meaning pvp gear is still optimal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell resistance is gone. There are no buffs that improve it and there shouldn’t be much, if any, spell resist gear left. We always thought the system was hard to understand and we weren’t getting much gameplay out of it. Now taking a step back, we can imagine how to develop a game where you’d want various forms of resist gear for certain situations and opponents. Resist gear could potentially be interesting, but it isn’t currently in World of Warcraft -- the game has just been moving away from that sort of thing for years.<br />
In the absence of spell resistance, there is no need for spell penetration on gear, so we’ll remove it as well.<br />
yeah great decision... remove spll resistance from an RPG game... makes alot of fucking sense. You should have rework it to make it desireable stat to force casters to use spell penetration etc. Not remove it. Mop didnt even start and retarded decisions are already comming...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ranged attacks will be able to be dodged. Hunters will benefit from expertise and will have it on their gear, which will also allow hunters and Enhancement shaman to share gear more easily.<br />
Yeah cause hunters really need pvp nerfs (especially against rogues) and more shit stats to stack just so we can share gear with enh shaman in pve... 2nd retarded decision in 1 post.<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that Enhancement shaman spells and rogue poisons will crit for double damage. Rogue poisons will also use the melee hit chance. ofc, cause 60% of dps comming from autoswing, poisons and 1 button aint easy enough.<br />
<br />

<br />
Because the old system was created by developers who no longer work on World of Warcraft (either because they've internally transferred or have left the company entirely) and the new guys don't want to say 'hey, the old guys' stuff works fine', with the implications that 1) the new guys aren't as good as the old guys, and/or 2) why does the company pay them anyway, if all they do is minor tuning and fixes. Thus the new 'generations' of developers have an incentive to toss whatever came before, regardless of its actual quality and add their own ideas, again without regard for their actual quality. <br />
<br />
In a well-run company these tendencies can be kept under control, but in the sort of cutthroat, money-grubbing enterprise that I believe Activision-Blizzard to be, yeah, the Not Invented Here syndrome is going to be viciously out of control.</div></div><hr />

In other words, we first determine if an attack misses, or is dodged or parried. If it is not, then the attack has a chance to be blocked. This gives block a consistent value, regardless of avoidance. Currently block becomes more valuable the more you have. <br />
Block will also have diminishing returns, much like dodge and parry. This doesn’t mean that the value of block will go down as you get more block. It means that it won’t go up by as much when you get more block. <br />
We don’t expect Protection warriors or paladins to get “block capped” other than during temporary effects, such as mastery procs on trinkets. Block tanks will be balanced around this change. Our intent is to make playing block tanks more fun, not to nerf them. <br />
Also notice how Shield Block and Shield of the Righteous have changed in Mists. <br />
<br />
Ok then Paladin will have the worst mastery because it's all about block, and it now has a diminishing return and Druid / DK will always be worst than Warriors because they don't have a shield and can't benefit from a second separate combat roll?</div></div><hr />

DPS isn't an issue in those circumstances, and if it is, it's not because someone is wearing a couple pieces of PVP gear... It's because your group is half AFK or just very bad. <br />
<br />
PVP gear in PVE is much less of a problem than PVE gear in PVP, particularly high rated PVP.<br />
<br />
While people AFK-ing or doing stupid things does not contribute to the well-being of your dungeon run, so doesn't having PvP items and not being at your best gear. <br />
Dungeons may be easy enough, but that is no excuse. if the group is struggling for whatever reason, your PvP gear puts an even bigger strain on the group than if you were wearing eqully ilvl PvE gear. <br />
(which doesn't say that wearing PvE gear would suddenly solve the problem though)<br />
Wearing PvP gear in PvE environments is being seen as lazy, because you haven't put effort in aqcuiring PvE stuff, and people just cannot get along very well with lazy people most of the time.<br />
<br />
If I see a PvP geared player in PvE then I just sigh and think &quot;oh look, another lazy git in LFD&quot;, but most of the time it is not that big of a problem. (since I normally do more than enough dps to compensate)<br />
<br />
to be fair I am all in favor of at least separating PvP and PvE stats, and make them more appropriate in their own environment, while making them less so in the others. It just makes perfect logical sense.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-03-02, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and the warrior class?Hello Jedi.. Build focus(rage) -&gt; spent focus(rage)<br />
<br />
Except that you don't build focus by getting beaten, warriors don't have a dot stacking (and using it as you main dmg) system, etc...<br />
<br />
So... no, only because a few spells are similar (so really, no other game a class can have a gap closer, otherwise it's a total WoW Warrior clone?).<br />
<br />
And yes, they're copying the SWTOR pvp system. Their only mistake is that they're not decreasing the other stats anymore (at least is what looks like) to give the way superior pvp stat. So, it looks like healers will be even more powerful in MoP (check their changes to interrupts, where the CD will be increased, so less interrupts in pvp).<br />
<br />
And stat renaming just for the sake of it while also saying that they're not into fluffier names? After years of &quot;Resilience&quot;? That's all because they don't want for it to look like a total ripoff from SWTOR expertise... lol.<br />
<br />
The way it is today (and was, it's not a Cataclysm only problem), pve gear, you're dead in pvp. pvp gear, you're ok in pve. There is no &quot;terribad in pve with pvp gear&quot;, only terribad players with any kind of gear.<br />
<br />
If as soon as you would start stacking pvp gear, you lose the base resilience (ok, defense (pvp) that is not like old defense for tanks, lol), then it could work like they're saying about helping ppl without pvp gear. But since everyone will have that + the extra from pvp gear, wich also will increase a lot your dmg and healing in pvp, &quot;pve players&quot; will be in a even worse situation since they won't do enough dmg + their oponents will reduce that dmg even more and heal whats left of his dmg easily while also obliterating him.<br />
<br />
On the other side, since pvp stats will be free (and doesn't look like they'll remove hit, expertise, haste, etc. from pvp gear to give only pvp def and pvp power), they will have a stupid amount of &quot;power&quot; (got it? haha) in pve setting. Since they're unlikely to change the pve setting to be &quot;brutal&quot; so the secondary stats are totally necessary or you're doomed to normal 5man dungeons forever (the random bg honor farm for pvp), that's probably what will happen... we're back to the TBC days of pvp gear &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pve gear for pvp AND pve.<br />
<br />
And all the spell resist/penetration nerfs... lol... now only have to wait to see if players will still need to gem spell penetration even if they're not casters (like DKs) since they're only talking about removing spell pen from gear, not from gems/enchants. And all the spell resist system is &quot;useless&quot; now because they made it useless, it's not a player fault or whatever.<br />
<br />
And no Blizzard, some ppl focus on pvp or pve because they want it, not because it's &quot;hard&quot; to do both. They'll never understand that some players hate WoW PVP and others hate any PVE (but play a game focused on it, lol... anyways...)... they see a guy &quot;Gladiator ImhereforPvP &lt;PvE Haters&gt;&quot; with 0 raid progression except for BH boss and think &quot;jesus, this guy need some help to get into raiding! Let's change everything!!!!!&quot;... even worse when they see an alt and consider it a main... you know, some &quot;Dragonslayers&quot;, &quot;Firelords&quot;, &quot;Saviors of Azeroth&quot;, etc. actually don't like their current classes for pvp and roll another one that they actually enjoy more for this purpose and only play it for pvp, not to get a second &quot;Firelord&quot; character... and Blizzard goes again with &quot;omg, this character need some help to get into raiding!!!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Gratz Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And in DCUO, tanks tank, healers heal, dpsers do dmg and controlers do CC. Also it's a total rock/scissor/paper where one role have the upper hand against another one (like tanks have the advantage against controlers).<br />
<br />
On top of that, your &quot;pvp trinket&quot; gives you imunity for a few secs after you use it (so you're not stupidly back to CC if others are just spamming it on you like WoW) and you can actually also use some of your resources to break free from CC (like wasting 20% of your mana to break from CC if your trinket is on CD, but the trade off is huge, so use it wisely or you'll be out of mana).<br />
<br />
While in WoW one guy can soak dmg, do a stupid amount of it, heal himself and cc others at the same time while another guy can only run around swinging his slow 2hand trying to hit something while being kitted/CCed forever... with only a 2min CD trinket to get out of CC (and back right after).<br />
<br />
So, no, MoP is far from this &quot;almost balanced&quot;... a stat change won't do the trick. If they also copied the swtor resolve system (or dcuo post-trinket immunity) then they would be a lot closer, but right now they're closer to it with Cataclysm than they can be with MoP.<br />

The new PVP/PVE gear system isn't really detail enough<br />
.From what it says right now, it only benefits PVP players wanting to do PVE, and not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Unlike Resil, the new PVP stats are free, so PVP-gear with the same ilvl would have the same amount of PVE stats in comparison to PVE gear.<br />
PVP stats would have to not increase with increasing tiers to make PVE gear players wanting to do some PVP a chance, or else PVP power and PVP defense difference would eventually be too large for a PVE geared player to overcome in later tiers.<br />
The above is possible if ilvl in PVP gear raises equally with PVE gear(hence equal amount of damage increase per tier on both sides).<br />
<br />
This is what happens in SWTOR with this system. The better the pvp gear gets, the larger the diference is between a pve player starting with pvp and a pvp geared player. At the same time the pvp gear is good for pve (except for hardmode/nightmare raids). The current pve gear progression if you want to get into raiding include pvp gear path instead of doing &quot;dungeons&quot; and heroic &quot;dungeons&quot;, while the pvp progression is... well... getting destroyed in pvp for a while (and a looooong while) until you finally get some decent amount of pvp stat...<br />
<br />
The diference between swtor and wow is that wow does have more pvp options while swtor only have &quot;random BGs&quot; (and within your server, no crosserver yet) right now, so you'll run into &quot;conquest geared players&quot; all the time while in WoW those guys are doing arenas or rated bgs instead of only random bgs . Also swtor still don't have the WoW &quot;mature&quot; valor/conquest system with the options like trade your pve currency for pvp currency and get pvp gear (or vice versa).<br />
<br />
But even with all the extra options in WoW, a true pve player that also wants to pvp will get into this huge problem as we progress the tiers/seasons. Because they have more stuff to do with their pve currency than only trading it for pvp currency to buy pvp gear. All this will lead to more BG afkers, etc. Huge &quot;QoL&quot; loss in the long run for the player base. If you're alread into the &quot;pvp system&quot;, everything is wonderfull, if you're not and need to get in, you're totally screwed (unlike pve).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruffertus</div><div class="date">2012-03-02, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And this, here, is the only valid concern anyone has expressed. It should work fine PvE to PvP (base resilience; if you want to PvP, earn the gear. PvE gear will help, but not optimal), but it really doesn't seem to work in reverse (PvP gear = useless stats to PvE encounters, plus lower item level = less stats; mind you, the new &quot;PvP only stats&quot; don't seem to count towards item budget, therefore PvP gear has less sta/str/agi/int than &quot;equal tier&quot; PvE gear, but the &quot;PvP only stats&quot; are supposed to make up for that difference)<br />
<br />
It think it should work fine. Consider two players with average ilvl, say 372. One's got it from Honor &amp; Conquest points, one from Justice &amp; Valor. In the new system, the first guy will have to have more Conquest pieces than the second guy has Valor pieces, but once he does, he should have exactly the same PVE stat budget, and be every bit as much a contributor to the raid. I look forward to that.</div></div><hr />

This. SWTOR was not first with PvP stats! Aion have used it for a long time and it certainly shows how much those stats weigh. If you're decked in PvP gear, no PvE geared player can touch you. Personally I think it's a great change and I hope they balance it well.</div></div><hr />

I just quit SWTOR after 2 months of play, PvP being incredibly horrible being a primary reason. I do not understand how making this change is going to benefit anyone. PvP gear &amp; PvE gear will still be weighted toward which application they're meant for (since the PvP stuff will be a lower ilvl). This doesn't make ANY sense as its explained of how we would have an easier transition from going one to the other. The only thing it will truly ensure is that the fully decked PvP player will now completely &quot;pwn&quot; the PvE player. It further separates people, and makes it more difficult/frustrating for the PvE player to jump into a PvP situation. Meanwhile the PvP player is STILL going to be less effective than their PvE counterpart. What gives? A base 30% &quot;PvP Defense&quot; means absolutely nothing if everyone has it. To quote a Pixar movie: &quot;When everyone is super, then no one will be&quot;. The only thing you're doing in essence is giving healing a buff since you're nerfing damage. Again, what gives? TLDR: These changes don't benefit the PvP or PvE dedicated people and actually make a transition MORE difficult.</div></div><hr />

Holy crap, read what you wrote. You sounds like a complete utter mess. Players in PvP gear already blow PvE people out of the water. Gear isn't even hindered by resil now they put all the basic stats they want you to have on it anyway. If it takes you forever to do &quot;dailys&quot; in pvp gear you're straight up just awful.<br />

Or, a contrario, it would make PVP items way too powerful in PVE while also being much easier to obtain.<br />
<br />
The resilience would be the same at the end of the day, but allow more people who pve to enter into pvp.<br />
<br />
The system basically is allowing pvpers to get into dungeon/raid more easily, but not the other way around.<br />

Plus it would not be like vanilla at all. Vanilla did not have resilience, and what I said would basically make the flat number higher, but the stat on items lower. Example: 30% base, 100 on item to 50% base with 70 on item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP gear will be lower in item level than PvE gear of an equivalent tier, however the Power and Defense stats will make sure that PvP gear is more powerful in PvP (both offensively and defensively) than PvE gear. In our budgeting system, the PvP stats will be free rather than causing other stats, such as Strength or haste, to be smaller as a result of including Power or Defense.<br />
<br />
Read what he wrote again, the PVE stuff is a HIGHER item level, hence has more stats,.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lazzy</div><div class="date">2012-03-02, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is this resilience change good at all? The idea is to lessen the gap between the top tier pvp and entry level. But what they are doing is basically giving the middle finger to anyone without pvp power or defense. Why not just simply make the base 50%, reduce the amount of resilience on gear and allow pvers to start out more? The way I see it now, they are basically giving pvpers the ability to do even more damage to non pvpers with defense too.<br />
<br />
With the addition of (PvP power) they negating the 30% reduction. The only time the 30% reduction makes sense with this new system is when you're fighting others without PvP gear. Which is basically before lvl 70 since 60 gear doesn't have any pvp stats on it anyway, and people who just don't have pvp gear yet. Outside of that people who get PvP gear will crush people still in PvE gear even harder. <br />
<br />
The only way to make this work so PvEs can ease into PvP ezer is to remove that (PvP power) junk. Then make it so (PvP defense) cap will only be like 50% dmg reduction from other players, this would make the gap between (PvP defense) and PvE gear not huge but big enough so people want to wear PvP gear.<br />
<br />
TLDR .... PvP power is stupid remove it no need for it.<br />

Sounds like you're on a PvP server. In which case you have no right to whine about being killed in open world.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc7f082fdd70</div><div class="date">2012-03-02, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don’t know if I like the PvP being lower ilvl but with free PvP stats.<br />
<br />
I know the highest attainable gear for PvE will be better than the highest attainable PvP gear, but if we look at it like this (which was said already before)<br />
<br />
PvE ilvl 500<br />
100 str<br />
100 sta<br />
50 hit<br />
<br />
PvP ilvl 500<br />
100 str<br />
100 sta<br />
50 hit<br />
50 pvp power<br />
40 pvp defense<br />
<br />
(which is basically was was said i.m.o because the pvp stats are free ones)<br />
<br />
This means/can mean the following: <br />
1. Pve Gear is not really usable in PvP because they lack the PvP stats (even if they are of higher ilvl) which is good. Because a higher ilvl is available for PvE gear, you can have more of your primary non pvp stats, but that comes at the cost of not having PvP stats. This is i.m.o a good trade off. <br />
2. PvP gear is perfectly usable in PvE if you look at it ilvl wise and will probably become the easiest way of gearing up, because PvP gear is not subject to RNG, which is the case for PvE gear. <br />
This will force people into doing PvP (not really forcing, but many will see it like that) and that is not a good thing since I dislike PvP.<br />
It will depend a bit on the available gear and how big the difference is between the PvP ilvl and the PvE ilvl, but the chance exist that this PvP gear is better than what is available through 5 man dungeons. And this will lead to a gearup like this: levelling &gt; regular dungeons &gt; heroic dungeons &gt; PvP &gt; raids &gt; (possible) next tier PvP &gt; next tier Raids…<br />
<br />
That would be a scenario of which I say: Me no gusta…<br />
<br />
It would be better if the PvP ilvl is less than the heroic dungeon ilvl, but even then PvP gear will get its place in PvE gear up.<br />
<br />
As for the rest: <br />
It is about time they equalize melee and spell hit. And that they put all crits at the same level. <br />
Expertise rating and other ratings were already the same, although you got tricked a bit because expertise was calculated in jumps of 0.25%. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WAIT WAIT WAIT if power increase your ability to heal your mate MORE ... well i see healer stacking pvp gear to heal MORE ! :&gt;<br />
<br />
I really don't know if you typed this to look funny, but I guess if you think for a few seconds, we can see that chances are pretty high that PvP power is only meaning something in PvP, and it will be doing nothing in a raid.</div></div><hr />

What if, *gasp* you had to choose between PVP items with POWER and items with DEFENCE? What if there weren't many items that had both stats, and instead you had to make decisions where you trade off damage output with survivability, so fine-tunable thanks to choices in armor pieces and reforging? What if a Rogue who stacked all DEFENCE was an invincible moron who couldn't kill anyone, and a priest who stacked all POWER could heal for massive amounts but got gibbed too fast for it to make any difference? What's that you say? Interesting PVP gear decisions seperating out the dedicated from the casual? Hurr Durr dumbing down the game etc.<br />
<br />
These changes mean that you can use your PVP gear to roam around and do quests, and even use LFD. However, you wont be as effective, and if you don't have any PVE gear at all, you may not have enough ilvl to qualify for heroics or raids. It means that people wont be nerfing themselves too badly if they roam questing in PVP gear, and Blizzard has stated they want to focus on bringing open world PVP back to the forefront, so that's exactly what players will end up doing. <br />
<br />
Yes, having a base DEFENCE stat seems pointless, when you could always get crafted resilience gear, or easily obtain it from farming BGs for a bit, but it makes it a little less intimidating, and since the game will be balanced around it, makes no difference for real PVPers. <br />
<br />
Spell Resistance should have been handled differently. I think that they should have added an easily changed buff, perhaps a temporary item enhancement, and you could choose between more combat effectiveness, or more resistance. Having one fight that required resistance in an entire raid is just a gimmick, and nobody likes doing half their normal dps because they had to stack gear with no combat stats on it, in favour of stamina and resistance. Even for themed dungeons, like Firelands, it would have been appropriate to have an npc give you a zone-specific buff, and you could choose between resistance, offensive, or defensive stats. Again, you have to make a decision between survivability and effectiveness, which is interesting but not complicated. <br />
<br />
I do agree with the comments about having a better mandatory tutorial system in-game, to teach people about stats, but honestly, the names of stats barely make any difference, unless you happen to sit with your character sheet open while in combat, reading your stat totals over and over again. I met more than enough people in LFD who didn't know what resilience was to know that simplicity is your friend when you play with a group that more or less disdains reading comprehension. The same people who complain about simplicity also complain about nubs and idiots. Well, that's your peer group people, so don't blame Blizzard for not gussying up the tooltips with &quot;fluffy language.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Not at all. The base would be higher, but people could still get res from gear. So the people who pvp more, will have more than those who don't. It just lessens the overall gap between entry and elite. The reason a lot of people do not pvp at all is because the entry level is just too high once you get into the later part of the expansion. But imagine if everyone started at 50% and toward the end of the expansion people were maxing out at 75%. That's not as big of a gap as entering at 30% and maxing at 75%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes reasoning 101. <br />
<br />
You can both PvP and PvE in proper PvP gear, you can only PvE in proper PvE gear. I see, elitist PvPers scared of PvE people popin' onto their turf. As said, strip their stats on PvE turf (Dungeons, Raids, non PvP zones) or give PvE items proper Power/Defense stats (based on ilvl/season) when a PvEr decides to join an Arena/Bg. <br />
<br />
The fairest thing there is, ofc you wont agree, since you wont be 100% certain now that you will one-shot 30% base defense guys outdoors without you 100% power and 70% defense from pvp gear gone. <br />
<br />
You know what's actually funny, World PvP was fine and dandy until Resilience came along, and all the PvE guys couldn't do shit to defend themselves but stand there and die. So all you world PvP demanding guys, need to see the big picture, there wont be World PvP aslong as this issue isn't fixed. 30% base defense doesn't do anything if everyone has 30% that the same as if it's 0%, PvE guys will still get one-shot by PvP guys and it will be the same shit as we have now since TBC. <br />
<br />
But my guess is, most dedicated PvPers will be able to handle pvping without Power/Defense from items and stand head to head with a bit lower ilevel items against a PvE guy, the only difference will be, that the guy might have a chance to fight back and occasionally even win, where's this is not possible today or as said for about 3 expansions now.</div></div><hr />

Basically, if you are going head to head against someone in PvP gear and you are wearing zero PvP gear or PvE gear, the PvP geared player will have the advantage of taking less damage and outputting more damage to you while you will do no/less damage to the PvP player and get 3 shot. As it is supposed to be. They noticed people are dedicating one way or another, so this makes perfect sense. <br />
<br />
They changed resilience in Cata to where they thought people would be smart and maybe invest into current content BOE PVP pieces before trying BGs, but as expected the playerbase has proven yet again that the average player is below average when it comes to understanding the game's mechanics and they mindlessly herpderp queue and get squashed and then complain that it takes too long to get gear to be effective while the above average players tell them not to invest in these things (omg waste of gold, you replace stuff SOOO fast!, just take your licks until you get gear, etc) so that they get their asses handed to them and remain free kills. <br />

How is it better if it's pretty much all the same, but under another sauce?<br />
Basically, what we have now when you start PvPing: you got 0 resi and you fight people with 4k resi =&gt; you get farmed all day long.<br />
In terms of MoP it'd be: you got 30% but you fight people with 30% + 4k that IN ADDITION negate part of your 30% defense.<br />

Now it seems it will be impossible to kill someone in full pvp gear unless you are also decked out in pvp gear. Pretty freaking lame if you ask me. Especially since world pvp is going to be more prominent. Back to the days of pve players having skirt certain parts of the world because hardcore pvpers are camping areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, wotlk pvp was better :/</div></div><hr />

Good artists copy, great artist steal.<br />
<br />
If you don't think development progresses by using examples from other companies that works, a good amount of them would be stuck in the &quot;dark ages&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cetius</div><div class="date">2012-03-02, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me that introducing the PVP-Power stat negates the idea that PVE-geared players will find entry into PVP easier. Currently only PVP-geared players have Resilience and therefore survive longer. Under the new system, only PVP-geared players will have PVP-Power, which will allow them to kill you faster. I don't see the difference. Also, what do they mean no buffs give Spell Resistence? Mark of the Wild, Blessing of Kings, Elemental Aura, Shadow Protection, Nature Resist Totem, and Aspect of the Wild all do. Are they even paying attention to what they're saying?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylreick</div><div class="date">2012-03-02, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They ought to make gear obtained from PvP completely worthless in PvE and vice-versa, keep them separate aspects. To switch from one to the other you would have content geared for it. For example, a player going from PvE to PvP would go into BG's where there is a flat damage reduction across the board to make PvE gear not so overpowered damage-wise. The rewards for this type would be entry level PvP gear, to be used in the more focused aspect of PvP (being arenas and rated BG's, this could allow for rated BG's to have a queue like regular BG's but have checks to make sure PvP gear is in use). For the PvP'er switching to PvE, there are already plenty of options being: faction vendors, quests, craftables, boe's, being carried through instances (not most optimal, but it's generally easier to carry through PvE than it is for PvP), they could make entry level instances (not heroics) available, or even provide new content geared towards the PvP turned PvE player.<br />
<br />
Doubt that would happen though, due to the need for development and resources. One can dream.<br />
<br />
For the most part, the stat changes seem excellent. Hope adding dodge on hunter attacks helps solve the issue in lower level pvp.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razamith</div><div class="date">2012-03-02, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suprised many people aren't getting it, so here it is in current terms:<br />
PVP gear currently: crafted 377, honor 390, conquest 403<br />
PVE gear currently: previous 359, justice 378, valor 397 <br />
<br />
Hypothetical new number:<br />
PVP gear future: crafted 346, honor 359, conquest 378<br />
PVE gear future: previous: 359, justice 378, valor 397<br />
<br />
Example pieces:<br />
conq chest PVP ---- valor chest PVE ---- justice chest PVE<br />
iLVL 378 ---- iLvl 397 ---- iLvl 378 <br />
Str 360 ---- Str 440 ---- Str 360<br />
Stam 610 ---- Stam 730 ---- Stam 610<br />
Haste 240 ---- Haste 300 ---- Haste 240<br />
Crit 240 ---- Crit 300 ---- Crit 240<br />
Def 200 ---- (Def 0) ---- (Def 0)<br />
Pow 200 ---- (Pow 0) ---- (Pow 0)<br />
<br />
A PVP in equivalent gear is &quot;behind&quot; a PVE in equivalent gear in PVE content.<br />
A PVE hits for a base higher number than a PVP, but due to POW/DEF the PVP will come out ahead. [a 378 hits like a 397 vs a player PVP with new stats]<br />
A PVP in higher gear is 100% equal to a PVE in lesser gear in PVE content, but would destroy them in PVP. The PVP can queue up as his appropriate item level in PVE content, and is accurate.<br />
<br />
Granted it may very well not be a full tier back, but you get the idea.<br />
