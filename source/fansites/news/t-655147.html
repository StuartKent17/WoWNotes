So ... What does it mean? Well, Wrath of the Lich King was trademarked a few weeks before the Blizzcon, we're not going to jump to conclusions here but WoWWiki will most likely give you a few things to think about on their Great Sundering (http://www.wowwiki.com/Great_Sundering) article.<br />
<br />
The Great Sundering, also known as simply the Sundering or the Cataclysm was a world event which reshaped Azeroth approximately 10,000 years ago at the end of the War of the Ancients. This event was triggered due to the Well of Eternity being destroyed.<br />
<br />
Prior to the Sundering, there was only one continent on Azeroth, referred to as Kalimdor. In the catastrophic explosion, eighty percent of the land mass was destroyed leaving behind the major continents and scattered islands that are known today: Northrend, Kezan, the Eastern Kingdoms, and the remnant still referred to as Kalimdor.<br />
<br />
The site of the Well of Eternity became a swirling vortex of power known as the Maelstrom. <br />
<br />
A few days ago, one of our user also spotted a test server named &quot;Maelstrom 3 Test&quot; in the US server list (it only showed up for a few seconds, see This post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=68186)). If the expansion is indeed The Maelstrom/Cataclysm, we can expect to see a few things here:<br />
<br />
Sargeras (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sargeras) and/or Deathwing (http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing)<br />
Azshara (http://www.wowwiki.com/Queen_Azshara)<br />
Goblins!</div></div><hr />

weeeheee!<br />
<br />
so the next continent will most likely be kezan, with a goblin capital <br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Kezan<br />
<br />
gl hf all bloodsail admirals! mwhahahaha<br />
<br />
<br />
would be awesome to see the new capital city be like booty bay, where you can actually attack the opposite faction. too bad that won't happen :-\</div></div><hr />

WoTLK was announced the BlizzCon immediately following TBC's launch, there is no surprise here.<br />

If anything it was expected, and should it really be a Maelstrom-based expansion, that would be 3 points to the supposedly 'fake' list of future expansions, 0 to the opposition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first off, this is talking about the NEXT expansion. i.e. lich king will be dead. however, i do agree that sargeras won't be in this. azshara will be last boss, they've been pretty predictable so far. illidan was easy to guess, arthas was very easy to guess. queen azshara for the maelstrom, comeon. <br />
<br />
also, as far as underwater etc, from what i can tell only one zone will actually be underwater. this zone also includes kul tiras gilneas etc, all the islands.</div></div><hr />

There was a something somewhere (be it in game or on wowwiki or whatever) that talked about &quot;murlocs showing up in greater numbers on our shores, as if they are running from something&quot; not exactly like that but words to that effect. Where have I read this before? Just trying to think of WHY we'd take a sudden interest in the maelstrom now after x thousand years. I don't doubt the maelstrom IS the next expansion nor that the title for it will be Cataclysm (been saying Maelstrom expansion for quite a while, feel free to go check my old posts here before calling me out) just couldn't work out an existing lore reason we'd be suddenly bothered about it.</div></div><hr />

The Skull of Gul'dan was a powerful demonic artifact created from the skull of the orc sorcerer Gul'dan. Used for a plethora of demonic activity, from opening portals to corrupting the forests of Ashenvale, its powers were finally consumed by Illidan Stormrage. Although weakened, the skull still holds power and is in Illidan's possession.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well on nearly every coast you could find either murlocs or naga, see those as &quot;explorers&quot; that are awaiting an order of the queen to attack us...<br />
or: azshara maanged to learn some old highborn magic and is becoming a treat :)<br />

I wonder if timbermaw hold and/or the bg in azshara get done</div></div><hr />

so the next continent will most likely be kezan, with a goblin capital <br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Kezan<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the next exapnsion is the great sea, you can expect MANY new continents and islands :) But yeah, Undermind will obviously be the new neutral city.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, to be honest, we let Arthas run free for the better part of four years, even though he was *supposedly* perfectly capable of obliterating all that is Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has the power to delay lore and create it on the go, even if some players frown upon it. Even though normally I love to see the story lines interconnecting without Blizzard having to intentionally fill the gaps, there's enough lore already developed for Maelstrom and the surrounding area, that I really don't care if I have plausible reasons for suddenly finding my character interested in what may lay there.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Don't look so smug. Illidan was merely a setback.&quot;<br />

<br />
I'm betting this is the case. I'd be surprised if more expansions are released for World of Warcraft, for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
<br />
Like it or not, graphically, the game is showing its age<br />
What they're able to do with boss encounters with this engine is showing its limits. Phasing introduced some cool stuff but there are still too many fights that come down to &quot;move here, move here, hit the orb, oh, he's going to enrage,&quot; etc.<br />
This is the biggest one. They haven't even released or announced anything about Icecrown yet, and Starcraft 2 is supposedly coming within the next year, if not the next half year. Then they have Diablo 3 after that. This is going to eat into Warcraft subscriptions. I think it's much more likely that Wrath will be the last expansion, then they'll ride SC2 and D3 for a few years, then release the new MMO.<br />
Another WOW expansion is going to be impossible to balance. They had enough trouble integrating the DK and with another expansion we can only assume there will be another 10 levels worth of skills along with a new tier of talents that they'd have to worry about. I don't think it's likely that they feel prepared to do this.<br />
Where does the lore go after this? Wrath was a lot better about this, but they've shown that advancing the story meaningfully has been very difficult given the constraints of the game. Arthas was pretty much the bad guy at the end of War3, and it's taken two expansions (including one with blue aliens and spaceships) just to get to this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be shocked either way, because Warcraft is clearly a huge cash cow for them, but I figure with two games on the horizon they have to figure this golden goose is going to dry up a little bit and they don't have an infinite amount of development resources. Cataclysm isn't an uncommon word and just because there was an event referred to as the Cataclysm in Warcraft doesn't necessarily mean that it's referring to another Warcraft expansion. I'm betting for the next couple of years, WoW is going to be sustained by content updates and not a new expansion.<br />
<br />
But I could be wrong. You guys certainly don't seem to agree with this synopsis. We'll see!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really, really, really, really, really, really, really looks like an early map of the new area.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the World of Warcraft Behind the Scenes DVD there was a map of the Isle of Kezan, which is above the Undermine, visible on a whiteboard. It shows:<br />
<br />
* Three transportation paths to: Booty Bay (by boat), Kul Tiras (by boat), and Ratchet (by zeppelin). Valgarde is also somehow connected.<br />
* What seems to be a lake in the center of the island, with rivers connecting it to both ports and Mount Kajaro.<br />
* Four coastal zones: Resort Beach, Savage Beach, Black Beach, and Rain Forest<br />
* Naga Gate off the western coast. <br />

Then they have Diablo 3 after that. This is going to eat into Warcraft subscriptions. I think it's much more likely that Wrath will be the last expansion, then they'll ride SC2 and D3 for a few years, then release the new MMO.<br />
Another WOW expansion is going to be impossible to balance. They had enough trouble integrating the DK and with another expansion we can only assume there will be another 10 levels worth of skills along with a new tier of talents that they'd have to worry about. I don't think it's likely that they feel prepared to do this.<br />
Where does the lore go after this? Wrath was a lot better about this, but they've shown that advancing the story meaningfully has been very difficult given the constraints of the game. Arthas was pretty much the bad guy at the end of War3, and it's taken two expansions (including one with blue aliens and spaceships) just to get to this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just.. no. If you look at the WoW playerbase, it would make no sense at all to suddenly stop developing it. Starcraft and Diablo have a whole different developer teams, they really dont affect WoW, and I completely disagree with the balance issues. I dont see why would it be any harder to balance it at level 90 than now, we dont even know will there be any new classes, I really doubt it :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
With names like Azshara and Sargeras, this sounds like the end.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that the new MMO is nearing 50% completion? Because if Cataclysm ends up being as epic as speculated, WoW only has a little over two years left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More ability's to balance and a difference in scaling. One of the problems LK brought along was insane scaling, the scaling isn't exactly good that we're at right now, you can already see that good in the T9 items, some of them have like 150 spell power, that's an insane upgrade. It's not weird to expect the first epic's of lvl 90 to have 250 spell power, which means that in total you could expect 3k unbuffed to become an (early) norm.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, while it is indeed likely to be the Maelstrom expansion (it is a logical expansion, and the list did say this... While I won't put my trust fully on a list, apart from a few design changes like a double entry zone, it has been entirely correct up to the specific level areas)<br />
However, for all we know it could also be the 2nd part of Diablo 3's name, it also fits that game, and the entirely new MMO of Blizzard could very well have this too.<br />
<br />
Maelstrom is a good guess, but you can't be sure just yet, just wait.</div></div><hr />

I mean, Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King are named after the threat: demons with KJ/undead with LK. Then what does the &quot;Cataclysm&quot; mean? Why would they call expansion that way? &quot;WoW: Cataclysm&quot;? The Sundering happened 10k years ago. They could just name the expansion &quot;WoW: Maelstorm&quot; or &quot;WoW: Wrath of Azshara&quot; or even &quot;WoW: Sea Queen goes nuts&quot;. What if the word &quot;cataclysm&quot; refers to something that is about to happen after we deal with the Lich King?</div></div><hr />

First off, where's the &quot;list&quot; so I can have a peek.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the rumor, I don't think that Blizz will ever stop expanding it's main asset flowing thingi. Wow with the current playerbase could very well continue to exist 10 years from now, that's my estimation anyway. And I don't like goblins :P<br />

Ah well..4500 mana and 4500 health was good for a lv 60 warlock. 10k /10k in TBC, now I am at unbuffed 19k / 19k...it is all numbers and we get used to them. Grab some MC epics and have a good laugh :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, the Cataclysm could also refer to an emerald dream expansion. Malfurion, being the first ever druid, let alone the main surging force behind stopping Azshara at the Sundering happens to be trapped there right now. People seem to jump to a conclusion that a maelstrom xpac instantly means pirates and goblins, because it doesn't. Infact, more so it points towards the emerald dream, naga, Queen Azshara and Malfurion. <br />
<br />
Secondly, to further back up my first point. Blizzard have confirmed, commisioned and i believe almost finnished a book due out next year entitled Stormrage. This book is chronicaling everything thats happened in malfurions life, much like Arthas: Rise of the Lich King did with Arthas' life before WotlK. Now i gather most of you havent read the books or even knew they exist but blizzard have set a recuring theme of releasing / announcing books to do with the next expansion before they announce it. It was done the same with not just the arthas book but with Day of The Dragon/ Night of the Dragon and Beyond the Dark Portal, both depicting and more so setting the story for TBC.<br />
<br />
I mean ofc i dont know for sure wether its right or not, but evidence seems to point in this more logical direction. As a matter of fact the title might have nothing to do with wow and even so i still believe the next xpac will be a maelstrom / emerald dream themed xpac in one because the two are so closely bound in lore that it would be like having TBC without Draenei.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Where does the lore go after this? Wrath was a lot better about this, but they've shown that advancing the story meaningfully has been very difficult given the constraints of the game. Arthas was pretty much the bad guy at the end of War3, and it's taken two expansions (including one with blue aliens and spaceships) just to get to this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buddy, there is a ridiculous amount of stuff left to do in WoW's story. As for Arthas he wasn't &quot;THE&quot; bad guy at the end of WC3, he was simply A bad guy. <br />
<br />
If there is an &quot;end goal&quot; for The Warcraft storyline it would end with Sargeras, not Arthas. Whiny prince boy is a small fry in the WoW villian lore. Honestly Yogg-Sarron is probably more of a threat than Arthas, it is just Yoggy hasn't been as blunt to the world about what he was doing compared to Arthas who has constantly attacked the EK and Kalimdor with people praising his name and such, its a popularity thing.</div></div><hr />

I too read this and immideatly thought &quot;finally I can play a female goblin rogue!&quot; but then I realized..if this list is indeed right, which seems so, then we probably won't get goblins this time around..maybe a new hero class or something like that, but not goblins..<br />
<br />
both in the &quot;draenor set&quot; and &quot;planes set&quot; on that list, new playable races are pretty clearly noted by the level 1-10 zones, while none such exist in the &quot;maelstrom set&quot; and the goblin capital is in stead listed as a high-tier leveled zone, it probably won't be a starter area.<br />
<br />
one can still hope, ofc, but it looks bad atm =/ I guess blizzard just doesnt have a alliance equalliviant to goblins, who would obviously be a horde race. and they probably dont want to release &quot;neutral&quot; races that can play for both factions just yet.. but who knows, we'll have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
I personally hope they'll maybe go beyond the list and include goblins as playable race in some way or another anyway! :)</div></div><hr />

I saw that same list ages ago when TBC was announced, and also before WotLK was announced, I'm pretty sure it's correct, and it is indeed a list of planned expansions by blizzard, even tho it isn't 100% accurate, it seems to be what they're still following while planning future content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bretac</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing causing me not to fully jump on the &quot;Maelstrom&quot; bandwagon is that the next Warcraft superbook (like &quot;Arthas&quot;) is going to be called &quot;Stormrage&quot; and supposedly be about Malfurion. This leans towards Emerald Dream. Since the story of the Maelstrom and the Naga are fundamentally tied in to the night elves, the next expansion could possibly be both.<br />
<br />
It will have goblins and pirates, though; it's why they've been pushing forward with vehicle technology so much in Wrath. Imagine ship-to-ship high seas battles in WoW :)<br />
<br />
Also, Gilneas, Kul Tiras, Kezan/Undermine, Broken Isles - all seafaring nations or territories.</div></div><hr />

But I'm not so sure &quot;Cataclysm&quot; is referring to the next World of Warcraft expansion at all - the name doesn't follow Blizzard's tendency to make expac names extremely long - but it could easily be the name of a brand new game. 'Diablo', 'Starcraft', 'Warcraft', 'Cataclysm', are all one-word names of franchises. Maybe their new MMO is a post-apocolyptic game where we battle for control of resources (ie Mad Max) or fight invading species. Could be sweet.<br />
<br />
Either way I'm pretty sure Maelstrom will be the next expac, but I hope they bring in some Emerald Dream lore because I sure have missed not having Malfurion around. Fandral Staghelm freaking sucks as a leader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it could be that they scrapped the idea of an entire emerald dream expansion pack, and in stead will include the emerald dream as either a huge raid instance, one or multiple zones, in addition to the maelstrom related areas, and that the elemental plateu areas said to be included in the &quot;planes set&quot; from the list will in stead be merged with the &quot;legion set&quot;.<br />
<br />
who knows ;) will be lots of excitement before the blizzcon no doubt!<br />
well..lets be honest, the day or a few days before blizzcon, since the announcement will probably be leaked just like TBC and WotLK was a day or so before :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I was thinking as well. But if that is the case, I doubt it will be unveiled at this year's Blizzcon. They already have the 2 high profile games being worked on which will (presumably) come out way before their new MMO. No need to steal their thunder along with WoW's. <br />
<br />
There is still plenty of time for them to register the new expac's name.</div></div><hr />

The can twist the lore and say that some nagas mutated by some x factor. The mutated nagas could have legs when they are on land but when they are in water they will look like normal nagas. Their tail would look like tabard when they are on land something like this<br />

nice, you drew that just now? <br />
I doubt they will add nagas as playable race tho..they're too much of a mutual enemy to both horde and alliance in the game already, also there would be too many night elf characters in the game :P since there's already night elves, blood elves who once were night elves, high elves who once were night elves, and then nagas as well who once were night elves (oh, and according to lore speculation, night elves were once trolls as well) xD</div></div><hr />

It makes sense. The underwater turtle mount, the greatly increased breathing time underwater, mounts swimming. The changes to fishing even. None of it is conclusive proof by itself but put together it hints strongly at being more active in and underwater for something we haven't had encountered yet.<br />
<br />
It's a good guess at this point whatever the next major expansion is, it'll almost certainly include a lot more water related activity and Maelstrom makes the most sense. And it is coming up on time for another announcement for a new expansion if Blizzard follows their pattern. The Maelstrom is also called the Cataclysm as well further hinting that direction. Not to mention the list giving us a loose plan for the future.</div></div><hr />

Ill think we will be also seeing, next to goblins etc that u allrdy said : <br />
<br />
Prob buccaneer class, like dk was the most seen npc class in wotlk, ill think buccaneer will be most seen npc class in maelstrom exp.<br />
<br />
Trolls, and plenty of em, with the 'king of all trolls on azeroth' : king rastaban<br />
<br />
Gilneas and Kul tiras<br />
<br />
Chogal<br />
<br />
COT-instances to protect the tomb of sargeras and save senjin.<br />
<br />
Queen ashara ofc, but controlled by a higher power, who i wanna bet will be the true endboss of that expansion : http://www.wowwiki.com/Neptulon <br />
<br />
Goblin princes<br />
<br />
Undermine<br />
<br />
Dragon isles<br />
<br />
Pandaria<br />
<br />
Hiji + plunder isle + isle of dr lapidis + giljims isle + tell abim + zuldare + ...<br />
<br />
Garona + son + merry the godfather : chogal wants em<br />
<br />
Maybe even council of tirisfall.<br />
<br />
Instances : prison in undermine, cleansing deathwings lair, cleanse purgation isle, prison isle south of hillsbrad, ...<br />
<br />
And because that mountain on kezan used to be the lair of deathwing, it doesnt mean its now his lair, according to the commics he lives below grim batol now.<br />
<br />
Maybe even underground kara + dark riders + legendary scythe of elune ? altough im thinking that would be more the way (yes, with the pure legendary scythe of elune) to kill the corruption that causes the Nightmare,next-next expansion then.<br />
<br />
And maybe even boats and miniature submarines for engis :o...</div></div><hr />

Notice it didn't have the DK starting zone in it, yet that was added in. I doubt the lower lvl areas for the Plane Set will be retained seeing as how many ppl complain about the lvling experience already. Unless its super accelerated I would expect that to be revised. Wasn't there speculation at some point that the third old god was chained below the maelstrom, Cthulhu? The Maelstrom is a good lead into the Emerald Dream, so there is a lot of sense in introducing it first. Malfurion's novel release could be to lay the foundation for the area around the original Well of Eternity and also as a lead in to the Emerald Dream, its like killing two birds with one stone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
A few years ago (or year can't remember) there was a whole list of expension and info somewhere posted. and so far it has been correct. Alot of people guessed it would be maelstorm enxt, altough the question is, will they add gilneas or grimbatol/kul tiras, and will they add the emerald dream?<br />
<br />
<br />
I dare to quote myself:<br />
<br />
<br />
The list is a well done fake.<br />
It does not originate from 2003, but from September 2007. At that time, all zone info up to and including the WotLK zones was public.<br />
<br />
This is the original source of the list: http://www.ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21;mid=119012268058738816.<br />
<br />
The poster (&quot;Reinjin&quot;) has shown in some other threads on the same site, that he likes to phantasize and make things up.<br />
<br />
If you care to check the history of http://www.wowwiki.com/Expansion_ideas, you can see, that he could easily make the list simply by using the fan-written expansion ideas there.</div></div><hr />

You're mixing Lovecraft with WoW. Cthulhu is an old one from the Cthulhu mythos by H.P Lovecraft. Granted, I'm sure Metzen got his inspiration for the Old Gods from Lovecraft's universe.<br />
<br />
C'thun = Cthulhu<br />
Yogg-Saron= Yog-Sothoth<br />

exactly, or since it involves several islands around the maelstrom, something like &quot;Shards of the Cataclysm&quot; or &quot;Remains of the Cataclysm&quot; something along those lines..<br />

If you look at the WoW playerbase, it would make no sense at all to suddenly stop developing it. Starcraft and Diablo have a whole different developer teams, they really dont affect WoW, and I completely disagree with the balance issues. I dont see why would it be any harder to balance it at level 90 than now, we dont even know will there be any new classes, I really doubt it :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They absolutely affect WOW, in that there will undoubtedly be a decline in subscriptions when they come out. I'm sticking a fork in mine when SC2 comes out, for sure.<br />
<br />
It would be harder to balance at level 90 because there will be more skills if they follow the same pattern they have with the previous 2 expansions. Even if they have the same classes, accounting for different skills will make it more difficult.<br />
<br />
And as a personal courtesy, I'd appreciate it if people wouldn't do that &quot;just... no&quot; stuff. It looks extremely pompous and is unnecessary.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotdogsamurai</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buddy, there is a ridiculous amount of stuff left to do in WoW's story. As for Arthas he wasn't &quot;THE&quot; bad guy at the end of WC3, he was simply A bad guy. <br />
<br />
If there is an &quot;end goal&quot; for The Warcraft storyline it would end with Sargeras, not Arthas. Whiny prince boy is a small fry in the WoW villian lore. Honestly Yogg-Sarron is probably more of a threat than Arthas, it is just Yoggy hasn't been as blunt to the world about what he was doing compared to Arthas who has constantly attacked the EK and Kalimdor with people praising his name and such, its a popularity thing.<br />
<br />
I definitely agree that there are a lot of avenues that they could follow with the storyline. The problem is that WOW hasn't been a great vehicle for it. We're on the second expansion and it still hasn't quite even reached the obvious boss character that we were presented at the end of WC3. I'll be impressed if they can effectively move along the storyline in an MMO environment as opposed to RTS. They definitely took some strong strides in that direction with Wrath, but BC was almost worthless in that regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So my computer died yesterday, leaving me no choice but to dig up my old laptop as my newer one is currently on loan to my mom. What an ancient thing. 8 gig hard drive, Windows 98, and just enough RAM to have a PDF file and internet explorer working at once...with a wait time of about 30 seconds every time I change windows. Useless for everything except surfing the internet for help reviving my desktop PC. As I waited for replies on tech support forums, I dug around a bit and found an old folder filled with crap I saved from my old desktop. I had kept the stuff there to transfer to my new PC, but it looks like I didn't care enough to go through with it.<br />
<br />
Stuffed inside the folder were a crapload of documents and stuff pertaining to the World of Warcraft alpha and beta, back before I even cared about the game. I had been sent the stuff from my friend, who was in the friends-and-family beta that preceded the general closed beta in early 2004. Most of the documents were plastered with '2003'. A lot of them were boring, and I can't remember reading any of them. Maybe I looked at a couple and decided it was boring crap.<br />
<br />
However, nearly four years later, I had enough of a mind to peruse them all. A lot of PDF-format conversions of early Gamespy previews, patents Blizzard took out for WoW, and so forth. I did find, however, a list of 'possible expansion sets' that looks really interesting. Some of the stuff looks a bit off, especially some of Outland and Northrend, so Blizzard isn't liable to stick to the rest of the plan down to the letter. But the quaint little PDF lists five expansion sets and the regions within. It goes as high as level 100. Nothing about it looks very official, though...it was nothing more than a wordpad document pasted into a PDF document, but I think it's of Blizzardly origins. I assume no responsibility for your actions if this list spurs you to run to the nearest auction house and buy thousands of golds' worth in armor so you can be ready for the Maelstrom.<br />

Let's take a look around the MMO marketplace. The game that some consider the pioneer of the modern day MMO, Everquest, is about to hit Expansion number SIXTEEN.

<br />

<br />
Onto lore. To think that WoW is going to end, because we're starting to see some of the names tossed around that people associate with &quot;The End&quot; is silly. The beautiful part about lore is that you can always write more of it ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saberoy</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vote to Maelstrom expansion, that is all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flashur</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think many predicted this expansion. This, or the Emerald Dream.<br />
<br />
I doubt we will see Sargeras though. Although Azshara worships him for some power (or did), I don't see how this is related, apart from the Tomb of Sargeras - and he's not there.<br />
<br />
If the speculative list is correct, I'm assuming we will see Deathwing under Grim Batol in a raid instance. If we can kill Malygos (albeit with a bit of Red Dragonflight help), we can fight against Deathwing after his body is unstable and he no longer has the dragon soul.<br />
<br />
Azshara is an obvious boss for this. However she may or may not be the final boss. She and her highborne were transformed by supposedly an Old God (or possibly Neptulon), so as long as that wasn't C'thun or Yogg, we could very well face another Old God. <br />
<br />
We could also see Neptulon even though he was banished, as he is supposedly back on Azeroth - probably through a summoning by Azshara and highborne under the command of the previously mentioned Old God. However, Neptulon probably won't be in the expansion, or we may even interrupt a summoning of him since we would supposedly fight him in the abyssal maw in the expansion after (based on if the list is correct).<br />
<br />
We can probably assume that Nazjatar will be a raid instance with Azshara as the final boss in that instance - whether or not it's the final instance is speculative. We all thought BT was going to be the final instance of TBC and then came along SWP.<br />
<br />
A CoT instance will be part of it. I'd assume a CoT : The Sundering or something, where the infinite dragonflight try to stop the well of eternity from blowing up, or possibly trying to stop Azshara from summoning Sargeras, and we'd obviously have to stop the infinite from interfering. Looking at the two main high level 5 man CoT's (Black Morass and CoS) they are significant in why the events of the expansion are occuring, hence why a CoT of the sundering would be appropriate.<br />
<br />
With the planned release of the Malfurion book, I thought there was a possibility that the Emerald Dream would be the next expansion. Don't forget though that Malfurion is heavily connected with / against Azshara so could quite possibly make an appearance for that encounter - as to Tyrande, in a Maeiv / Akama / etc style involvement.</div></div><hr />

You sir are trying incredibly hard to fight this, why is it? Ive always been on the fence over this &quot;list&quot; but lets face it..<br />
<br />
<br />
If this list has the next expansion right, does that not dispute all of your &quot;research&quot;? Even if this list was created in 2007 and is a total fake, how would they have guessed this next expansion right? Can we get a sticky in the forums where you can eat your words at?<br />
<br />
<br />
My hat goes off to whoever originally found this list, it is right so far :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Stormrage book. Mentioned already in the topic. It comes out (tentatively) in 2010. Stormrage is pretty much the central figure in druidic lore, and the Dream itself.<br />
<br />
-Broll Bearmantle (night elf druid from the comics) was sent by Fanghelm at the end of the first arc to the Dream because of some disturbance. I dont remember exactly and the comic is buried somewhere so I can't reference it.<br />
<br />
-Entering the Dream for that one quest in Icecrown to save Bridenbrad.<br />
<br />
They are dropping more hints for the Dream than anything else. If it's not going to be an expansion in itself, it's definitely going to be featured very soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It refers to the event of The Sundering, but maybe there is also an upcoming event in WotLK (death of Arthas, transference of the Lich King's essence, or what have you) that corresponds do a &quot;new&quot; cataclysm, one that will rend Azeroth again, and which somehow leads into a third expansion centered around the Maelstrom and its denizens?<br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft: Cataclysm's Ashes&quot; or somesuch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I hope the expansion does feature a storyline with the Emerald Dream and hopefully the return of Malfurion. The Night Elves have been corrupted by Staghelm and his obsession with immortality for too long - that is not the druid way - while Furion was willing to sacrifice for the sake of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
It will be interested to find out what has been happening inside the Nightmare... as Malfurion told Remulos in his brief appearance in WoW: &quot;I fear for the worst, old friend. Within the Dream we fight a new foe, born of an ancient evil. Ysera's noble brood has fallen victim to the old whisperings. It seems as if the Nightmare has broken through the realm to find a new host on Azeroth.&quot; Hmm, could this ancient evil be Deathwing?! And the lame-o Infinite Dragonflight (would be &quot;new&quot; back then). I'm speculating of course, the book should explain it, I just hope we get to go help out Cenarius and get our druid leader back!</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying that it is fake but I'm saying it may not still be valid. For instance check it out in the &quot;Dreanor Set&quot; do you see that thing after Terrokar. &quot;The Deadlands&quot;? This means that The Broken Wastes (or w/e that minizone in southern Terrokar Was) was originally supposed to be a zone. Also look at the Northrend set. It states Crystalong Forest is a lvl 72=75 zone. This might be real, it might be not, point is things change. They could very well have changed the zones around maybe adding new races in the new ex-pac?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shelly</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just figured I would handle this bit of stupidity right here. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm betting this is the case. I'd be surprised if more expansions are released for World of Warcraft, for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
<br />
Like it or not, graphically, the game is showing its age<br />
<br />
There's a funny thing I've noticed with Blizzard games. They program them for machines based around the best available around when they start programing. Which means their games typically perform well on average machines when they are finally released. Also WoW's standpoint has never really been the actual graphics, but rather the artistic style of the game. <br />
<br />
Although they have gone pretty far just stylistically and are now having to add far more textures and effects to keep stuff looking fresh. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What they're able to do with boss encounters with this engine is showing its limits. Phasing introduced some cool stuff but there are still too many fights that come down to &quot;move here, move here, hit the orb, oh, he's going to enrage,&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
All boss fights fall into three overlapping categories; the resource race (dps, mana, heals, etc), the gimmic (attack this spot while this is going on, attack that spot while that is going on) and the positional (don't stand in the fire.) This will never change regardless of what they do with the engine. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is the biggest one. They haven't even released or announced anything about Icecrown yet, and Starcraft 2 is supposedly coming within the next year, if not the next half year. Then they have Diablo 3 after that. This is going to eat into Warcraft subscriptions. I think it's much more likely that Wrath will be the last expansion, then they'll ride SC2 and D3 for a few years, then release the new MMO.<br />
<br />
And your point is? <br />
<br />
Blizzard makes money by producing games. They have a very small, well regarded and prosperous group that's made some very lucky people very very rich. The new MMO will probably just be another one among them, hopefully it's another huge success but I doubt that even Blizzard is banking on another WoW. Perfect storms like that don't come along as often as you would think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another WOW expansion is going to be impossible to balance. They had enough trouble integrating the DK and with another expansion we can only assume there will be another 10 levels worth of skills along with a new tier of talents that they'd have to worry about. I don't think it's likely that they feel prepared to do this.<br />
<br />
PvP could be pretty rough. Especially if/as they start giving melee more attacks. Think lolret was bad, wait until you have an arms warrior who can do more than just MS, kite and overpower in their basic rotation. PvE though, well other than the new abilities mostly it all goes into a couple chunks of code and they call it a day. Maybe add a bit more to diminishing returns but that's really about it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Where does the lore go after this? Wrath was a lot better about this, but they've shown that advancing the story meaningfully has been very difficult given the constraints of the game. Arthas was pretty much the bad guy at the end of War3, and it's taken two expansions (including one with blue aliens and spaceships) just to get to this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you kidding? The story in LK has advanced for me far more meaningfully than it ever did in BC. BC had many fewer hooks to it outside of the starting zones. I'm not sure they'll be able to make the story as personal as LK has been but there's still a lot of time left for them to hammer it out. <br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be shocked either way, because Warcraft is clearly a huge cash cow for them, but I figure with two games on the horizon they have to figure this golden goose is going to dry up a little bit and they don't have an infinite amount of development resources. Cataclysm isn't an uncommon word and just because there was an event referred to as the Cataclysm in Warcraft doesn't necessarily mean that it's referring to another Warcraft expansion. I'm betting for the next couple of years, WoW is going to be sustained by content updates and not a new expansion.<br />
<br />
WoW expansions are almost a license to print money for Blizz. I mean they get at least $50-million back in retail sales the first night an expansion is released. They aren't going to stop them anytime soon, D3 won't really cut in because it's doubtful that they will go with a subscription model - far more likely that they will go with a content module purchase model (think Guildwars and DLC) and as for the new MMO. Well an MMO is a guaranteed success at 150,000+ users here in the USA, at around 250,000+ users worldwide. Blizzard can crap in a box and meet those numbers. It's unlikely any new MMO will put much of a dent into WoW subscription numbers, simply from brand loyalty if nothing else. <br />
<br />
<br />
But I could be wrong. You guys certainly don't seem to agree with this synopsis. We'll see!<br />
<br />
<br />
You probably are wrong but I doubt it really matters which of us is right.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ike0072</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's gotta be fore the new movie, and associated merchandise, perhaps an expac later.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muxx</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've personally thought the next logical expansion is the Maelstrom/Azshara ever since we've known that Northrend was this Expac.<br />
<br />
Looks like it's confirmed.<br />
<br />
Lots of underwater quests? Gogo turtle mount?<br />
<br />
<br />
not sure if this has been mentioned here but the maelstrom is going to rise up out of the water. this expansion premise has already been revealed in Arthas:Rise of the Lich King, *SPOILERS* Arthas at one point in the very last chapter of the book/epilogue is going through visions in his head right b4 he wakes up from sleeping. He sees visions of us all open AQ, and doing all the crap in WoW Vanilla- BC, then he jumps into the future...and sees an entire continent rising up from the maelstrom (nazjatar) and he sees that the emerald dream is under attack and what not and sees malfurion. <br />
<br />
imo this expansion is going to be Emerald Dream mixxed w/ Maelstrom. Azshara is attacking the Emerald Dream b/c she's po'd that malfurion screwed up her plans to summon sargeras into the world 10000 years ago and what not. but after we deal w/ her corruption of the dream. but then find out that there was someone controlling her (another old god) we kill the old god and then it leads to Cho'gall or something and possibly Deathwing as a last raid boss these are just what I'd think bliz might do.</div></div><hr />

And they trademarked the single word &quot;Cataclysm&quot;. They didn't trademark every phrase with the word Cataclysm in it. <br />

<br />
So ... What does it mean? Well, Wrath of the Lich King was trademarked a few weeks before the Blizzcon, we're not going to jump to conclusions here but WoWWiki will most likely give you a few things to think about on their Great Sundering (http://www.wowwiki.com/Great_Sundering) article.<br />
<br />
The Great Sundering, also known as simply the Sundering or the Cataclysm was a world event which reshaped Azeroth approximately 10,000 years ago at the end of the War of the Ancients. This event was triggered due to the Well of Eternity being destroyed.<br />
<br />
Prior to the Sundering, there was only one continent on Azeroth, referred to as Kalimdor. In the catastrophic explosion, eighty percent of the land mass was destroyed leaving behind the major continents and scattered islands that are known today: Northrend, Kezan, the Eastern Kingdoms, and the remnant still referred to as Kalimdor.<br />
<br />
The site of the Well of Eternity became a swirling vortex of power known as the Maelstrom. <br />
<br />
A few days ago, one of our user also spotted a test server named &quot;Maelstrom 3 Test&quot; in the US server list (it only showed up for a few seconds, see This post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=68186)). If the expansion is indeed The Maelstrom/Cataclysm, we can expect to see a few things here:<br />
<br />
Sargeras (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sargeras) and/or Deathwing (http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing)<br />

One of the problems LK brought along was insane scaling, the scaling isn't exactly good that we're at right now, you can already see that good in the T9 items, some of them have like 150 spell power, that's an insane upgrade. It's not weird to expect the first epic's of lvl 90 to have 250 spell power, which means that in total you could expect 3k unbuffed to become an (early) norm.<br />
<br />
Did you forget how they balanced the healing power at the end of BC? They merely combined the two so the numbers weren't astronomical. Think about it, all they have to do is rebalance the system for the new expansion, tweak a variable here and there, and we can have our HP/Mana and stats back down to BC level by merely a slight adjustment to the way things scale and to the amount of damage that bosses do and their total health overall. Don't underestimate what the devs can do with the game, they always have an ace in the hole.<br />

This is also the reason why The Maelstrom will not be set mostly underwater and why Arthas saw the land rise up.<br />

You're mostly looking at Raid instances and questing for the Emerald Dream and similarly for the underwater parts of The Maelstrom.<br />

As the levels in the false/real list show similar starting levels 2 different expansions for The Maelstrom and The Emerald Dream make no sense - they will be combined.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the Cataclysm name - to me a word like that sounds better and more effective on its own rather than WOW-Cataclysm of whatever.<br />
<br />
So I make that it's either WOW:Cataclysm (full stop) or it's got nothing to do with the next expansion and is the new MMO.</div></div><hr />

ps: i am not nearly as well informed about lore and other things in such nature. Not even well informed on the timing of how blizzard does things. I just love and play the game, but a full new Expansion so soon seems idk fast. Yes there are elite guilds that have already killed Algalon, but more than half the WoW universe has not, and there is still The Lich King... idk we will see in the end i guess.</div></div><hr />

not sure if this has been mentioned here but the maelstrom is going to rise up out of the water. ........then he jumps into the future...and sees an entire continent rising up from the maelstrom (nazjatar) and he sees that the emerald dream is under attack and what not and sees malfurion. <br />

<br />
The fact that they posted it at the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office as a &quot;Computer game software and related instruction manuals and guides sold together as a unit&quot; means it's going to be something sold seperately, like WoW, Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King. If they would just implement a &quot;small&quot; new area into an existing game, they wouldn't have to sell it as a computer game, just patch it, and you don't have to register a patch at the trademarks office in this way, I think. So I think it's safe to say this is going to be a new game or expansion to WoW.<br />
<br />
I just hope for a WoW expansion, still can't get enough of the game, but we'll see after Blizzcon :-)</div></div><hr />

The most notable fact here, is the things they are making the trademark for. For TBC and WotLK, there is a full list: Comic books, computer game strategy guides, trading cards, coloring books, adhesive stickers, rub-on transfers, notebooks, stationery-type portfolios, posters, greeting cards, calendars, instructional leaflets in the field of computer games, computer game instruction manuals, catalogs in the field of computer games, advertising boards of paper or cardboard, photographs, art prints<br />
But for Cataclysm, there's only a very small list. Of course, this may change over time, but then everyone can create stuff with this name on it. Not clear why this is..</div></div><hr />

The Lich King always been defeat-able, and intended defeat-able. Starting a new expansion with a &quot;great earthquake have raised several islands around the Maelstrom&quot; would be easy, and then we're set for some story.<br />
<br />
A lush paradise of islands, Zeppelins, naga's, no flying mounts, and so on. <br />

The Goblin capital of Kesan is also very likely.</div></div><hr />

Figure out it yourself. Before 2007 theres not a single word or reference about this list. First time ever it was written to internet was after BC release(!) and the maps for Northrend have been available since 2004, presented in a rpg book.<br />

Finally a fairly recent posting from someone claiming to be a &quot;Go Fetch Me a Coffee&quot; no one guys in blizzard who had friends that told him some about the projects they were working on. Due to the economy he was let go. <br />
<br />
Here is what he posted: <br />
<br />
Well, <br />
<br />
With the failing economy and the initial 4% stock fall Blizzard decided to take precautions and shave about seventy of its &quot;fluff&quot; employees as they call them. We do little things around Blizzards HQ. Honestly it just looks good on a college graduates resume. But I was there long enough to make some decent friends in the company. And I learned a few things from some friends who shared with me things they ought not be sharing. <br />
<br />
Like the details and plans for the next expansion that they have already started on. <br />
<br />
Right now it is tentatively being called &quot;Depths of the Dark Tide&quot; or sometimes the name &quot;Depths of the Emerald Tide&quot;, or &quot;The Surging Depths&quot; all names are getting tossed around for finality. DotDT Great acronym right? Well anyways, as always, Blizzard keeps coming up with new ideas to keep the game fresh. They have some real whoppers they are planning apparently. <br />
<br />
Here is just a few things I heard/seen would be in there. <br />
<br />
-No New Races <br />
-Two New Hero Classes <br />
*Archdruid <br />
*Blade Master <br />
-New Ocean Exploration System <br />
-Underwater and Sea Top Siege Combat with Customizable boats and submarines. <br />
-&quot;Shove Off&quot; Zoning from anywhere in Azeroth <br />
-Level Cap is only 85* There are some discrepancies. <br />
<br />
Apparently Azshara has been cooking something up. Deep within The Rift of the Maelstrom, Azshara has been up something new. She has began using Titan Technology along with the dark energies still resonating from the Well of Eternity to... create water? That's right. She creates huge pulses of water in the Rift that spew up into the world creating massive tidal waves causing the ocean to slowly encroach on the rest of the world. Flooding the world is her dream, however there are side effects she wasn't expecting. The floods or named by the outside world as &quot;The Surge&quot; are pulses of stormy waves that crash into everything raising the water level. This is sending the world out of balance and adversely affecting the Emerald dream, causing the nightmare to swell like the tides rising in the real world. This apparently colapses the planet eventually, meaning all the heroes of the world have the stop Azshara before she screws things up. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tentative Zone Lists <br />
<br />
Zones work differently after you leave Gilneas. They are separated into Seas. Subzones are the islands and various other thing's you come across. The subzone islands aren't as big as normal zones, but the ocean is supposively going to be of grandeur size. <br />
<br />
Gilneas <br />
Finally you get to see behind the gate. Gilneas led by Tarn Greymane finally opens it's gates as the Surge threatens to over take them. Because of this calamity both horde and alliance can prove themselves through a series of phase quests. <br />
<br />
They are leading supplier of boats at the beginning of the expansion. <br />
<br />
Kul Tiras <br />
One of the main islands, A town called Boralus will be a major port here for the alliance and will be used a bit through out the expansion. It's one of the few non tropical islands in the expansion. This is where the alliance starts to first learn about the Surge. <br />
<br />
Tel Abim <br />
Tropical island of Tel Bim. Concept art is showing it to be a bright and tropical paradise with very scenic beaches. The Goblins are trying to start tourism/vacation resort here, but of course they need you to clean the island up for them first. <br />
<br />
Zandalar Island <br />
Whats an expansion without a Troll area. The trolls are trying to get their great land tamed and are attempting something called &quot;Land Mending&quot; involving weaving ley lines to repair their fractured island. There are various tribes of Trolls here from all around the world, friendly and unfriendly. <br />
<br />
Kezan <br />
The big island is home to many things including the home town of the Goblins... Undermine. The Goblins facing the Surge agreed to let the alliance and the horde use Undermine as a home base to combat the Maelstrom. This will be the one of the two next Shattarah/Dalaran type cities. Goblin submarines are popular here as well. <br />
<br />
The Broken Islands <br />
Home of the Blade Master's starting island of Saramar, The Stormreaver Bay, Tomb of Sargeras, one of the first 5 mans.(And no, there is no Sageras in his Tomb) <br />
<br />
Plunder Island <br />
Home of the Bloodsail. A 5 man will be here as well as quite a bit quests dealing with the various attacks all over the South Sea's dealing with their raiding and ... well... plundering. The Bloodsails are almost as popular as Murlocs this time around. They are everywhere. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Maelstrom is a main zone, with a bunch of subzones in it as well. <br />
There are alot of 5 mans surrounding the main rift as well as the capital of Nazjatar. This zone is supposively massive. All of these zones are underwater mainly and require the goblin submarines to explore. A lot of siege vehicles come into play here. Much like the Boats work on the surface of the ocean, in the maelstrom the submarines come into play. Of course a lot of the zones have &quot;air pocket&quot; areas in them where you get off of your sub to explore. <br />
The Rift is where Azshara is producing her mighty Surge and will be one of the final raid instances in the expansion. <br />
<br />
Ok, this sounds like alot of zones... but the islands really aren't that big. All of the Ocean is maybe 4 zones. <br />
<br />
This is where the Emerald dream comes into play along with the Arch Druid Hero class. <br />
<br />
The Roaming Flats <br />
The ever changing lands of the Roaming Flats... built to be a defense mechanism against invaders of the Emerald dream, of course the nightmare infection has messed things up here. It is highly confusing and never looks the same twice. From what I hear this is one of blizzard's new babies. The next step after phasing quests. The zone actually changes every hour and locations relocate themselves. This zone has a huge quest chain that you need to complete to get to the rest of the emerald dream. <br />
<br />
The Dying Paradise <br />
The most corrupt part of the emerald dream. Dying trees slowly fall down to the ground. Horrific twisted versions of azeroth animals roam attacking anything near them. Black darkness spreads in some areas while it looks like fall time in others. A huge offensive of druids attempts to push back the corruption. <br />
<br />
The Tangled Sky <br />
This sounds like the most interesting zone in expansion imho. A series of winding roots tangled through the sky. Not sure how this one will work to be honest. But it sure is... different? <br />
<br />
The Eye of Ysera <br />
Overly bright green energy spews in this still pristine part of the emerald dream. The flows are trying to push back the nightmare infection leaving pretty little rows of flowers and trees in it's wake. The architecture is unique slightly similar to the night elf structures. There is a massive town here and will act as another Dalaran/Shattarah. <br />
<br />
The Sleeping Grove and The Breathing Grove <br />
The starting area for the Archdruids. Not much else is known. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ocean/Depths Exploration/Shove Off <br />
Boats! Submarines! <br />
The new system is going to involve you actually building and customizing you're own boats to sail the sea's with. The sea's are very open and full of little cavern's and other things in the middle of nowhere. Well this is what they are aiming for anyway. Pirate attacks and sea monsters to follow. <br />
This is going to be one of the new selling points come the expansion. Boat and submarine battles amongst players. <br />
<br />
You get to customize your boats with different parts improving it's performance, speed, armor, and weapons. They will be using the same system as siege vehicles but they will probably add more bells and whistles. <br />
<br />
Also you can upgrade from boats at 84 to submarines. This will be the only way to enter Maelstrom. Subs will be much like boats be be underwater. The better parts will come from engineers. This will be their new direction. They will get epic parts like blacksmithing gets epic weapons. <br />
<br />
Oh, no flying mounts when over the ocean. The Surge prevents you from flying. Enjoy the sea's. You can enter the sea's off any beach in Azeroth by going over the fatigue area while in a boat. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Leveling System <br />
They are pushing forward with a more story driven progression. Northrend has some great story driven quest lines. <br />
You still gain experience but there caps. Upon reaching enough experience to level you must complete quest chains to unlock the next level. They will be soloable. It's just in concept stages right now, and they are expecting a lot of whining if they do decide to go through with it. But they want players to feel progression just besides gear and seeing new raids. <br />
It might not make it through, but how many other things that are planned get scrapped? <br />
<br />
<br />
Archdruids <br />
<br />
Archdruids... why those are just leader druids. And who would want to play a normal druid when there are ARCH druids. Yeah I know right. But they do play quite differently. <br />
The Archdruids are the druids trapped in the emerald dream. These druids focus more on the ethereal aspect of druids. Their abilities are suppose to reflect their control over the emerald dream. No spells have really been discussed that I personally know of. <br />
They are going to continue like death knights and have an impressive starter zone inside the Emerald dream that involves them fighting off the nightmare and waking themselves up. They work with Malfurion himself. <br />
<br />
Blade Masters: <br />
These clever brutes have taken up residence in the Saramar ruins. They use it as their training grounds testing their trainees on the residents of the ruins. The whole zone is to prove yourself. Half of the starter zone is you on a large boat with other graduated blade masters heading back to the mainland. You fight off sea monsters and pirates etc on what they try to make feel like a long journey home. <br />
<br />
Blade Masters are going to tri-wield. They will equip 2 one-handed items and then 1 two hander. I am not sure exactly how that works but different skills use different weapons. They have a &quot;reactive&quot; skill set. Where certain skills are only usable after using other skills. An example I was given was Sliding Slash, it's like a damaging charge, after using that attack two other skills become available. Each of those two skills break off into 2 or three other possible skills. So different attacks are available depending on how you start the fight. You would have a whole different slew of options if you started the fight up close instead of using sliding slash to gain distance. If you don't use the next in the set of skills in 5 seconds, it starts over again. There are also finishers... There are 5 tiers of skills in the set up. Sliding slash being a first tier and so on. You have a special attack button that will do a different attack based on the tier you are on and the last used skill. It ends the combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that after the Mealstrom, there will only be one more expansion. This is due to Sargeras's Tomb being situated in the Mealstrom. During, or after, the Azshara fight, due to her having masses of magic power, somehow (I have no idea how) a portal will open allowing Sargeras to begin his attempt to enter Azeroth.<br />
<br />
As for the name, Cataclysm... Hmmm it doesnt fit well imo. I always thought it would be something like World of Warcraft: Enter the Mealstrom. Can someone explain how the name Cataclysm (the sundering, 10k years ago) - fits at all into this? :-/</div></div><hr />

There is no evidence, because all postings in the official forums were cleaned 2007, since the old forum-software was such a piece of crap.

BS. That list comes from this post (http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21;mid=119012268058738816;num=24) by Reinjin on Allakhazam, a known fabricator, and was posted in September 2007, about a month after Wrath of the Lich King was announced at Blizzcon 2007 (August 2007).<br />
<br />
More importantly, almost everything in the list was already known about from text in-game or in the World of Warcraft tabletop RPG sourcebooks.<br />
<br />
Draenor Set: BC was already out, but even before that, almost all the locations in Outland had already been mapped out for Warcraft II. For example, this map from the instruction manual (http://www.wowwiki.com/File:Draenor_map.jpg).<br />
<br />
Northrend Set: All of the zones in Northrend were mapped out and details in the RPG sourcebook World of Warcraft: Lands of Mystery (http://www.wowwiki.com/Lands_of_Mystery), published in 2006.<br />
<br />
Maelstrom Set: Again, most of these locations have been mentioned in various sources both in and out of the game. The Lands of Mystery RPG sourcebook actually has maps and details for several islands and locations beneath and around the Maelstrom that the poster didn't even list, such as the Gishan Caverns, Scintal Reef, Boiling Terrace, Pillar Deep, Drowned Reaches, Nazjatar, and the Rift. Those are actually much more likely to be turned into full featured zones than &quot;The Maelstrom&quot;. If that turns out to be the case, will people treat this post as prophetic too?<br />
<br />
Plane Set: Pandaria has been in the lore since WC3, and Hiji was on a map in the original Warcraft RPG sourcebook. Wolfenhold, the Green Lands and the Dying Paradise are made up names. The Xorothian plains are part of the Warlock epic mount quest (see Dreadstead of Xoroth). The Emerald Nightmare is first mentioned in early WoW quests. The Eye of Ysera and the five Elemental Planes (Deephome, Skywall, etc.) are from the Warcraf: Shadows &amp; Light (http://www.wowwiki.com/Shadows_%26_Light) RPG sourcebook, published in 2004, which had a lot of info on the Emerald Dream, the Elemental Planes, the Twisting Nether, and the cosmology of the Warcraft world in general.<br />
<br />
Legion Set: K'aresh is the ethereal homeworld, mentioned in Outland quests. Argus is the original eredar/draenei homeworld, also well established in the lore before the list was posted. Mac'Aree is described as one of Argus' sacred cities in draenei newbie quests. Not included on the list, however, is Kaarinos, a mountainous region of Argus mentioned by a new draenei NPC in Wrath. Maw of Oblivion and Burning Citadel are made up.<br />
<br />
In other words, once again, it's BS. Educated BS based on lore and information that's been available to everyone for many years, but BS nonetheless. Since Blizzard has already developed and published a lot of this stuff, it of course stands to reason that a fair number of these predictions will make it into the game, but it doesn't mean the list is valid in the least. Don't buy into it. I could come up with a more extensive and likely list just by browsing WoWWiki or going through my RPG books.</div></div><hr />

That list comes from this post (http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21;mid=119012268058738816;num=24) by Reinjin on Allakhazam, a known fabricator, and was posted in September 2007, about a month after Wrath of the Lich King was announced at Blizzcon 2007 (August 2007).<br />
<br />
More importantly, almost everything in the list was already known about from text in-game or in the World of Warcraft tabletop RPG sourcebooks.<br />
<br />
Draenor Set: BC was already out, but even before that, almost all the locations in Outland had already been mapped out for Warcraft II. For example, this map from the instruction manual (http://www.wowwiki.com/File:Draenor_map.jpg).<br />

Not to say it IS NOT BS, but... are you seriously saying that it's BS because the list follows a logical pattern of lore? Honestly, the info is totally in question. It is every bit as likely to be made up as it is to be 100% genuine.</div></div><hr />

New Leveling System <br />
They are pushing forward with a more story driven progression. Northrend has some great story driven quest lines. <br />
You still gain experience but there caps. Upon reaching enough experience to level you must complete quest chains to unlock the next level. They will be soloable. It's just in concept stages right now, and they are expecting a lot of whining if they do decide to go through with it. But they want players to feel progression just besides gear and seeing new raids. <br />
It might not make it through, but how many other things that are planned get scrapped? <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />

Though very unlikely to be a truthful post, I do somewhere hope this will be implented. It's a great idea and should've been in the game from the start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I'm saying it's BS because a guy posted it claiming he got it &quot;from a friend of a friend&quot; who he &quot;had a falling out with and can no longer contact&quot;. I'm saying it's BS because he's been known to make stuff up. I'm saying it's BS because people claim it predates BC constantly, when it was first posted only a month after Wrath of the Lich King. It's BS because he's never posted any proof of this information, despite saying it came from a bunch of documents he has, but never posted anything else from these PDFs which includes &quot;patents&quot; and &quot;gamespy previews&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm just pointing out that because everything he posted was readily available at the time of posting, apart from three or four made up names, the fact is that anyone could make a list that would've been at least as viable, and easily one even more viable, simply by browsing wowwiki articles.<br />
<br />
People on Allakhazam, for some reason, immediately took it at face value as being true, and now two years later, people run around posting this as fact, saying they don't know where it came from, but that it definitely came out before Burning Crusade, which is patently false, as you can see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
azshara will be most likely last boss, whole place will swarm with nagas <br />
deathwing will be like sartharion instance placed in grim batol area which will be introduced on the placeholder next to wetlands. Most likely it will be 80-82 area(not the instance but grim batol).<br />
<br />
exapnsion after maelstorm will be emerald dream and then burning legion thingy where you will fight sargeras <br />
<br />
Expect to also kill nozdormu in maelstorm and ysera in emerald dream so that only alexstrasza will be left from the aspects and will sacrifice herself to kill sargeras for younger races she loves so much and to finally give young races faith into their own hands. <br />
Here is end of wow and you can w8 for next gen mmo from blizz in few months to feed your addiction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore you believing its true is based on some random person saying &quot;it was posted 2003&quot; and this all comes down to what you want to believe.<br />

Right, because Blizzard is really hurting at the moment? If anyhting I'd imagine they would benfit from the recession, due to many young people without jobs having too much time on their hands and in need of cheap entertainment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It proves to me that there are tons of people out there, like me, who love the game so much that they scrutinize, worry, and dissect every aspect of it in the effort to know it more intimately and consume it as quickly as possible. Within these giant threads of wild speculation, QQ, flaming, and nonsense, I find a sense of community I often lack elsewhere (i.e. around people who don't play WoW).<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler could post something like this: <br />
&quot;I can tell you one thing about the upcoming patch/expansion - its the letter 'W'. More on this soon!&quot;<br />

<br />
Its not the fact that someone was let go that is out of the ordinary, it is the additional, pointless additional part of information &quot;due to the economy&quot; which makes no sense. Just seems like something the creator added to lend his story more credibilty.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ent0mbed</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like it or not, graphically, the game is showing its age<br />
<br />
<br />
Not financially. It's making more money today than it ever has. At the end of the day if an MMO is making money it will continue to see development.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the biggest one. They haven't even released or announced anything about Icecrown yet, and Starcraft 2 is supposedly coming within the next year, if not the next half year. Then they have Diablo 3 after that. This is going to eat into Warcraft subscriptions. I think it's much more likely that Wrath will be the last expansion, then they'll ride SC2 and D3 for a few years, then release the new MMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check your time lines... we probably won't see anything to do with Icecrown until patch 3.4 as I believe that is the intention of Blizzard (four major content patches before the next xpac... more if the next xpac is delayed for some unforseen reason). MMOs have the ability to live on for a long, long time. Do you realize that there is a new expansion slated for &quot;Everquest&quot; this coming November? The first one, not Everquest II! And you think WoW is going to end soon? Doubt it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Where does the lore go after this? Wrath was a lot better about this, but they've shown that advancing the story meaningfully has been very difficult given the constraints of the game. Arthas was pretty much the bad guy at the end of War3, and it's taken two expansions (including one with blue aliens and spaceships) just to get to this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
You realize that Blizzard wrote all of this lore themselves right? It's not like it's actual history or something. Because of that they can write new stuff that goes beyond what's happened so far. People have been predicting the downfall of WoW since shortly after TBC launched. Who cares. I'll play it until I don't like it anymore (or until it goes away) and then I'll move on to the next game. Not a big deal at the end of the day.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiaz89</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">people are too caught up on that list, comments such as: &quot;oh no, there arent any new starting area listed in the maelstorm set, there will be no new hero class / playable race /cry&quot; are stupid<br />
<br />
Comments such as &quot;that list is complete bullcrap and was made up by some dude in 2004&quot; is also stupid.<br />
<br />
I'd say the list has been pretty accurate so far, we see a few detail changes, as in no dead lands, and hey, the 2nd starting zone for blood elves aint quel'thalas, its the ghostlands. And oh, the DK starting area isnt even listed there<br />
<br />
Meaning, the next expansion will most likely be the maelstorm / cataclysm, it will most probably be announced at this blizzcon 09 if they follow their routine that they've had so far, and for the people who thinks there will be no new wow expansion, heh, keep thinking that, lots of people will have their chance to flame you for beeing wrong later on.<br />
<br />
The next expansion can still include a new race, a new hero class, or new zones / content, take &quot;the list&quot; with a big grain of salt, think of it as a plan set up by whoever many years b4 actual development/release, and when are such plans ever 100% correct? Never. Just like a release date set a year ahead is never correct, stuff comes up, someone got new ideas, someone felt like they needed to add something. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has learned a ton of things about mmos since their first mmo release, and stuff is bound to change.<br />
<br />
Ill just end with saying that i too believe that this is a sign of the next xpack, and i also believe that there is some truth to this &quot;list&quot;, obviously.</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft suggests something because everyone already knew what Warcraft was. Before Warcraft came out, when people heard the title for the first time, did it suggest anything more than what Cataclysm suggests now?<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow amazing, where'd you find it?!!<br />
<br />
The 20+ times its already been mentioned in this thread?!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nidhöggr</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Figure out it yourself. Before 2007 theres not a single word or reference about this list. First time ever it was written to internet was after BC release(!) and the maps for Northrend have been available since 2004, presented in a rpg book.<br />
IF it was from 2003, then why didnt anyone copypaste it to another site from wow forums or why doesnt anyone whos been reading forums from the beginning recall such list (myself for example)? Surely a list revealing expansions wouldve been most read and bumped thread right?<br />
<br />
+ it has a Twisting nether set in it, Azeroth cant match the strength of Nether at all (my opinnion and backed up by a cinematic in Warcraft 3)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm playing since release and I also recall that I have seen this list in the old wow forum software. This was at a date that BC was announced, but not released, so I said: &quot;Well, it's not that hard to make a prophecy about burning crusade when we all know about it. And the Northend Set is not that hard to imagine. If the list is right or wrong will be proven in the xpac AFTER Northend.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was my opinion all the time I knew about it (and I knew it a long time, for sure!) and that's where we are now...<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the list is not a fake, and when it is, it is obviously a good one. But what I am saying is, that the people believing that this list is from september 2007 are wrong. I have seen it first while in BC beta. Back from then untill now, the list was extremly accurate and I believe it's indeed a leak of an old masterplan blizzard had.</div></div><hr />

(Not confirmed, found off the forums) This is a picture of the old forums of a forum moderator posting addons or something... Most of the zones have been correct both name and level wise, so if this is true then we can expect the Maelstrom, the Abyssal Plane (with Emerald Dream/Nightmare included), and then Argus.

<br />
Blizzard's New Hero Class<br />
<br />
The next Hero Class to grace World of Warcraft: The Blademaster <br />
<br />
http://www.littlepeon2004.com/Media/ProductImages/blademaster.gif<br />
Here's a small image taken <br />
from WC3 to remind you folks<br />
<br />
For more information (i.e. Lore) please visit the Blademaster Wowwiki page (http://www.wowwiki.com/Blademaster).<br />
<br />
Class Mechanic: Melee (DPS), Healing (hybrid)<br />
Race: Horde - Orc, Alliance - Dranei (if not all races)<br />
Allowable Equipment: Leather<br />
Allowable Weapons: Predominantly a 2H Weapon user, though is capable of equipping 1H Weapons (though much like the DK, the class is heavily biased towards 2H weapons)<br />
<br />
The race is speculation at this point, with the two races named above classed as likely candidates if Blizzard decide not to take it in the same direction as they did with Deathknights (all races). Another unusual point that has probably caught your eye is the fact that the Blademaster is classed as &quot;healing&quot; as well as &quot;melee&quot; - lore at this point so far is vague at best or simply unknown but we're sure Blizzard are thinking of something (it's suggested that the Blademasters close tie-in with Shamans may be the connection Blizzard will use).<br />
<br />
Talents: Learning from their introductory Hero Class, Blizzard were delighted with their decision to make all Deathknight trees viable for Tanking as well as DPS. The same will be applied for the Blademaster class, where all three trees will be viable for Healing as well as DPS. <br />
<br />
<br />
Class Mechanics and System<br />
<br />
Here's the main meat and currently the most sensitive information about the new class. Just like the Deathknight class, Blizzard have been working on a completely new system that has not been seen previously in WoW. Bear with me, as this is a tad complicated to explain with mere words though conversely the system appears pretty simple.<br />
<br />
The Blademaster itself appears to be a very slight cross between a Rogue and a Deathknight. The healing aspect of the Blademaster (who will be called BM henceforth) is unlike anything seen in WoW before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Discipline<br />
<br />
Baring only a minuscule resemblance to Warrior's Stances, the BM has 3 &quot;Disciplines&quot; - The Opener, The Set-up and The Finisher Disciplines. Much like Warrior Stances, certain “Discipline Moves” can only be used in certain Disciplines, however that's where the similarities end. <br />
<br />
Disciplines can almost be described as some sort of 'Combo' System. Basically, the BM will always start a battle with their 'Opener' Discipline. The Opener will have 3 separate skills (aka “Discipline Moves”) by default. Once the BM has inflicted their 'Opener', the action bar will change to reflect 'The Set-up' Discipline (much like how a Rogue's action bar changes when they go from stealth to visible), which also contains 3 separate skills by default. Once the BM has inflicted their 'Set-Up', the action bar will change to reflect 'The Finisher' Discipline, though this time they have a choice of 4 'Finisher' skills. Upon inflicting their Finisher, the action bar reverts back to 'The Opener' Discipline. Going out of combat will always revert the BM's action bar to 'The Opener' Discipline, however changing targets mid-battle does not.<br />
<br />
As well as the skills exclusive to said Disciplines (which are exclusively called 'Discipline Moves'), the majority of skills/abilities are neutral, meaning they can be used in any Discipline. So to clarify the point, here's an example of how the average battle will work (using existing abilities from other classes as an example):<br />
<br />
BM in Opener Discipline has the choice of 3 Discipline moves:<br />
1. Cheap Shot<br />
2. Ambush<br />
3. Charge<br />
<br />
The BM chooses 1. Cheap Shot -<br />
<br />
==&gt; Discipline automatically changes to 'The Set-up'<br />
<br />
BM in Set-up Discipline has the choice of 3 Discipline moves:<br />
1. Sinister Strike<br />
2. Cleave<br />
3. Hemorrhage<br />
<br />
The BM chooses 2. Cleave - <br />
<br />
==&gt; Discipline automatically changes to 'The Finisher''<br />
<br />
BM in Finisher Discipline has the choice of 4 Discipline moves:<br />
1. Eviscerate<br />
2. Execute<br />
3. Expose Armor<br />
4. Slice n' Dice<br />
<br />
The BM chooses 3. Expose Armor<br />
<br />
==&gt; Discipline automatically reverts back to 'The Opener'.<br />
<br />
(Note: The Player is not limited to just Discipline Moves, as they have access to Neutral abilities throughout each Discipline)<br />
<br />
<br />
The player is able to mix and match their moves and will be constantly shifting to new Disciplines during any battle. The BM is unable to skip to any Discipline they choose; they must always follow the cycle (Opener =&gt; Set-up =&gt; Finisher). The GCD for all 'Discipline moves' will be the standard 1.5 seconds, meaning it will take a BM at least 3 seconds to go from their Opener to their Finisher. Out of all the Disciplines, it's 'The Finisher' Discipline that stands out the most, which by reading the next section will explain why:<br />
<br />
<br />
Introducing: The Sashimono System<br />
<br />
The Sashimono is the small banner worn by all Blademasters. For more information please visit the Sashimono Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimono). It is the Sashimono that will be the main focus behind the Blademaster (much like Runes and Deathknights). Every time the BM inflicts their 'Finisher' move, depending on what Finisher they choose will depend on what colour their 'Sashimono' will become. There are 3 different Sashimono Colours the BM can have and each colour include their own different property:<br />
<br />
RED: Power<br />
BLUE: Defense<br />
GREEN: Healing<br />
<br />
Underneath the BM's health bar are 3 grey gems (think DK's runes) that represent the Sashimono and it's current property. Once the BM inflicts their first Finisher move, one of the grey gems will become a certain colour depending on what Finisher was inflicted and the Sashimono will change to that specific colour. Here's a picture below (created by me in a very poor, unprofessional manner!) to clarify:<br />
<br />
http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/7199/blademastercopy.th.jpg (http://img136.imageshack.us/my.php?image=blademastercopy.jpg)<br />
<br />
The BM can have up to 3 coloured Sashimono gems at any one time. The Sashimono will only change colour to reflect the newest Sashimono gem gained, this can be see in the picture provided above where the left-most Sashimono gem is the most current one. If the BM has 3 Sashimono gems and executes another 'Finisher', then the oldest Sashimono gem will disappear to make room for a new one. If the BM has no Sashimono gems, the colour of their Sashimono will be grey.<br />
<br />
What is the use of these Sashimono gems?<br />
<br />
The gems directly influence all of the BM's Discipline Moves (Opener, Set-up and Finisher) as well as neutral skills/abilities. All Discipline moves will do their default action if the BM has no Sashimono gems - by changing the colour of their Sashimono, their moves will have an added effect depending on what colour their Sashimono is (typically Red Gems will make a move more 'powerful', Blue Gems will add a defensive effect and Green Gems will add healing properties). Lets take Cheap Shot as an example - without any Sashimono Gems the BM will use Cheap Shot and it will stun the opponent for 2 seconds. If the BM had 1 Red Sashimono Gem, the Cheap Shot would stun the target for 2 seconds and increase all damage against that opponent by 5% for the duration of the stun. If the BM had 1 Blue Sashimono Gem, the Cheap Shot would increase the time the target is stunned for by 1.5 seconds. If the BM had 1 Green Sashimono Gem, the Cheap Shot would stun the target for 2 seconds and reduce all healing done to the target by 15% for the duration of the stun. So, if the BM has 2 Red and 1 Blue Sashimono Gems and inflicts the target with Cheap Shot, the target will be stunned for 3.5 seconds and all damage against the opponent will increase by 10% for the duration of the stun. Please note, this is purely an example to showcase how Sashimono Gems affect combat; Cheap Shot was used purely as an example and is not necessarily an ability the BM has.<br />
<br />
Certain moves aren't affected as linearly like the example above. Some Discipline moves will only have one added effect that does not increase cumulatively, so having multiple gems of the same colour will not have an increased effect and different colours may not stack. In this case, it's the newest Sashimono Gem that takes priority (which will be the colour the BM's Sashimono changes to) and those certain Discipline moves will be affected by the prioritised Sashimono gem. These types of moves typically require two gems to work (for example, a certain Finisher may require two Red Gems for increased power, two Blue Gems for added defense or two Green Gems to convert damage into health for example). So to recap, each finisher produces a certain Sashimono coloured Gem and these Gems have a direct effect on moves/abilities/skills. The Sashimono Gems are affected in three different ways:<br />
<br />
1. No Consumption: Typically ALL Discipline moves do not consume the Gems. The BM simply requires having the Sashimono Gem in possession for the Discipline moves to be affected. Some neutral moves may only be activated if the BM has at least one or two coloured Gems in possession.<br />
<br />
2. Cooldown: Some neutral skills/abilities will induce a 6 second cooldown on the relevant Gem (akin to DK's Runes). During the cooldown period, the Gem will STILL affect ‘Discipline Moves’ - however, it cannot be used for neutral Skills/Abilities. Sashimono Gems affected by cooldown can still be replaced with fresh new Gems, if they happen to be the BM's oldest Gem in possession.<br />
<br />
3. Consumption: Some typically powerful neutral skills/abilities will consume the relevant Sashimono Gem if used. Powerful healing spells are often in the consumption category, requiring the BM to undergo the Opener =&gt; Set-up =&gt; Finisher cycle to gain a new Sashimono Gem (a consumption skill/ability will always consume the 'newest' gem).<br />
<br />
Sashimono Gems are active as soon as they're created for 16 seconds before they disappear. Therefore a BM cannot simply run around with a full set of Sashimono Gems in or out of battle indefinitely. They can, however, be refreshed in battle using a certain Finisher...<br />
<br />
Finisher Discipline<br />
<br />
Each Finisher Discipline move will create a certain colour Sashimono Gem. Here's an example using existing skills/abilities not necessarily used by BM's.<br />
<br />
Finisher 1. Eviscerate (Creates a Red Sashimono Gem) <br />
Finisher 2. Execute (Creates a Blue Sashimono Gem)<br />
Finisher 3. Expose Armor (Creates a Green Sashimono Gem)<br />
Finisher 4. Slice n' Dice (Creates either a Red, Blue or Green Sashimono Gem randomly and refreshes all Gems in Possession) <br />
<br />
So it is up to the BM as to what colour Sashimono Gem they would like. Depending on the battle or circumstance, the BM may need to be defensive and therefore having a majority of Blue gems may be the best way to handle the situation. In PvP, Red Gems will typically be the way for burst damage, however both Green and Blue would still be a necessity depending on the situation. Using the 4th finisher provides the BM with a random colour Sashimono Gem, which can seem risky however it's almost a necessary move to make in order to refresh your other Sashimono Gems if their 16 seconds are nearly up.<br />
<br />
With the Sashimono System, Blizzard have been trying to create a class that, although inevitably comes with a standard rotation for PvE, is varied enough to keep the player interested. Since Sashimono Gems affect moves/skills/abilities in different ways, each round of rotation will produce something different and each rotation may require a different move to be made depending on what colour Gems the BM has in its possession.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
<br />
As stated before, the healing system is something never seen in WoW before, and in the current stage it's very experimental. Blizzard are very happy with the way their first experimental class has turned out (DK), and due to its successful nature, Blizzard are confident enough to gradually move into even more experimental territory.<br />
<br />
If you've understood the Sashimono system thus far, you've probably already worked out where this is heading. Since the majority of all Healing spells at the BM's disposal require Sashimono gems, and since the only way the BM can require those gems is through an aggressive melee nature (the Discipline cycle), the BM will need to melee AND heal simultaneously. So, how is this done?<br />
<br />
Mark of Focus<br />
<br />
A unique ability the BM has is the 'Mark of Focus'. Upon placing the Mark on an enemy, as long as the BM is in melee range, the BM will be able to unleash all their 'Discipline Moves' onto the enemy without having to target them. The BM is completely free to target their comrades, in order to heal/buff. This means, the BM is free to execute their Discipline cycle onto an enemy inflicted with the Mark to gain Sashimono gems, and heal their comrades simultaneously. Only one target may be Marked at a time, and the Mark will disappear if the target goes out of combat.<br />
<br />
The general consensus was that a Healer would never have an 'infinite' resource system (such as Energy, Runes and even the Sashimono system) and only Mana (or similar concepts) that would eventually 'run out' would be viable. The argument was that, an infinite system would imbalance the game, especially PvP where it would be possible to just infinitely heal through damage and/or turtle during the brief downtime. Blizzard feel that this 'infinite' conundrum does not apply with the Sashimono System. The BM is always forced to fight or be in the midst of battle to top-up it's resource, simply turtling or playing defensively would make it impossible to infinitely heal through damage since valuable Sashimono gems would not be accumulated in this manner. Although this may make it sound like the BM is very susceptible to Kiting, there will always be a few tricks up the BM's sleeves to surpass this tactic (though that's not to say they're impossible to kite for short periods).<br />
<br />
Healing Qi<br />
<br />
BM healing spells are unlike regular heal spells or HoTs. All of the BM's heals are instant cast, but how it works is slightly different. The BM, being a melee class does not involve itself with casting bars. The way it works is the BM will instantly place a 'Healing Qi' (Qi = Chi) on their Target and after a certain amount of time (usually 2 - 3 seconds) the Qi will erupt and heal the target for its full amount (so it's sort of a cross between a HoT and a regular heal). Each Target may only have one Healing Qi on them at a time, so a BM cannot simply spam instant heals on the Target. The BM will have to wait until the particular Qi has erupted before they can place another on the same target. In PvP terms, since it's nigh on impossible to 'interrupt' the BM from healing (due to it's lack of cast bar), it's balanced so that the Healing Qi can be dispelled before it's erupt. Regular heals go into the &quot;No Consumption&quot; category of Sashimono gems, meaning the BM simply requires to possess the gem (usually green) but the more powerful heals will often induce a cooldown on the gem(s) or even consume them. Heals do not inflict GCD on 'Discipline Moves' and vice versa.<br />
<br />
True Hybrid<br />
<br />
Although homogenizing is something particularly current on Blizzard's agenda for the sake of balance, and the fact that keeping all Healers/DPS/Tanks relatively on par with one another is a current philosophy, it almost fails to apply for the BM class. The BM is the first true hybrid class, where it's not taking an either/or role, it takes two roles simultaneously. Due to the fact that the BM will add DPS to an encounter as well as Healing, there is no problem for the sake of balance for the BM to be a weaker at DPS'ing or Healing than other classes (a jack of all trade if you will) and that's solely due to the fact that the BM will be taking on two roles for the cost of only 1 raid member.<br />
<br />
The way the BM class is designed is that if the player wants to go all out DPS and not bother will Healing, they simply need to stack up on Red Sashimono gems as well as a few Blue gems. If the BM wants to be on par with other healers, simply stacking up on Green gems (with a few blue) will make them a lot better with their heals. The system allows expert players well versed with the class to mix and match all three colours and bring out the best of both their DPS and Healing and become a valuable asset to the raid. It's a dynamic class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Defining Abilities<br />
<br />
Although most of the actual abilities (especially 'Discipline Moves') are currently unknown, a couple have come to light that really defines the class.<br />
<br />
Wind Walk<br />
<br />
For those who have played Warcraft 3, this is a cross between the Wind-Walk and Mirror Image abilities. Once cast, the BM becomes stealthed and gains an unstealthed mirror image copy of itself. Unlike the Rogue's Stealth, the BM keeps its movement speed at 100%. This subtle change to stealth actually creates a large difference between both the abilities. Unlike Rogue's stealth, the BM isn't completely hidden away from its enemies since the Mirror Image will always be an indicator as to the whereabouts of the BM.<br />
<br />
The Mirror Image copy receives 200% damage from all sources, and once attacked will put the BM into combat. However, the BM will remain in stealth and will only come out if they attack or are attacked (or their Mirror Image hitpoint's are reduced to zero). This ability is actually more of an offensive one than defensive. It can almost be called an anti-Rogue ability, since it's sole purpose is to draw out the enemies. The Mirror Image will move along side the BM and can attack any target chosen by the player, however it will inflict no damage. The Mirror Image's purpose is to lure the enemy in and almost become a 'CD-Waster' where the enemy may burn all their Cooldowns on the Mirror Image (for example a Rogue may try to Stun Lock the Mirror Image, only to be in for one nasty surprise). Once the Mirror Image's Hitpoint fall to zero, the BM will come out of stealth. Wind-Walk cannot be used in combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Qi Bomb<br />
<br />
This unique Healing spell is like a reverse 'Bomb' attack used by many bosses. Basically this Healing Qi attaches itself to a friendly target. After 3 seconds, the Qi erupts and explodes, healing the target and all party or raid members within 15 yards of the target for XXXX amount. This spell induces a 6 second Cooldown on 1 Green Sashimono Gem.<br />
<br />
This can almost be called a team work spell, where its up to the raid member and not the healer to position themselves in the best manner in 3 seconds for the most efficient heal. Communication is key.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heal<br />
<br />
Instantly places a Healing Qi to the target that heals the target for XXX after 2 seconds. The spell does not require any Sashimono gems, however the spell will be inaccessible if the BM gains or is in possession of any type of gem. This is a spell that's predominantly used before or after a battle when the BM is not in possession of any type of Sashimono Gem. Although it uses up no resources, it's weakness is an indication that the player cannot rely on this spell alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blade Incision<br />
<br />
The enemy target is inflicted with Blade Incision, doing XXXX amount of damage and inflicting a debuff. 50% of all heals made on the target will heal the BM and party members within 15 yards of the target. The debuff will last for 8 seconds. Consumes one blue Sashimono gem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: This is one of many Hero Classes Blizzard have already conceptualised. Out of the many, the Blademaster appears to be the one that has been fleshed out the most, however this is not a guaranteed indication that the Blademaster will be the next Hero Class for World of Warcraft. End.<br />

I've been thinking this over. What if it's the expansion for Starcraft 2? They've said it'll be 3 games (SC2, and 2 expansions) I believe. And it does sort of fit in. If anyone remembers, the authorised SC mission packs were just one word. <br />

I didnt give away a spoiler but it wasnt really related to the Athas story. Seems like Blizz likes to give out hints in the book. If your looking for any other hints ready Night of the Dragon. I have a feeling it hints at a boss we might be seeing soon also.</div></div><hr />

As much as id love to see Deathwing introduced in the game as a big boss, why would one assume this be in the maelstorm xpac? I dont study wow lore enough to see the connection, is there one?</div></div><hr />

Oh god no, that's too long.<br />
<br />
If we get Arthas in 3.3 (I think we do, anyways), that'll be towards the end of this year. They've stated he'll be the end boss for WotLK, so we'll either go straight to 4.0 in probably Dec-Feb, or we'll have a fourth content patch which is just more dailies/more 5 mans/druid forms/etc. But then why delay 4.0/Maelstrom/Whatever it'll be? They might as well put those features into that first patch of the third expansion.<br />
<br />
But let's wait and see :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ten thousand years before the orcs and humans clashed in their First War, the world of Azeroth cradled only one massive continent, surrounded by the sea. That landmass, known as Kalimdor, was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival amongst the savage elements of the waking world. At the dark continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies. The lake, which would later be called the Well of Eternity, was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite Great Dark beyond the world, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms. <br />
<br />
<br />
In time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids cautiously made their way to the edges of the mesmerizing enchanted lake. The feral, nomadic humanoids, drawn by the Well's strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the tribe, making them strong, wise, and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted the name Kaldorei, which meant &quot;children of the stars&quot; in their native tongue. To celebrate their budding society, they constructed great structures and temples around the lake's periphery. <br />
<br />
<br />
As the seemingly endless ages passed, the night elves' civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. Azshara, the night elves' beautiful and gifted queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls. Her servitors, whom she called the Quel'dorei or &quot;Highborne&quot;, doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the Highborne were secretly envied and disliked by the rest of the night elves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could quite easily be a new game set long before warcraft.<br />
<br />
Anything about this is pure speculation atm<br />
<br />
<br />
Seeing as Blizzard claims the new MMO is based off a new IP/universe with brand new everything, that is highly unlikely as it would still be the Warcraft IP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there was a list during beta already showing what each of the major patches would bring. Except they were keeping 3.2 a secret, which happens to be CC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't like the name... sounds like its going to be explosive.<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm was explosive.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koukou</div><div class="date">2009-07-02, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fun fact: The cataclysm is the Greek expression for the Deluge, from the Greek kataklysmos, to 'wash down' (kluzein &quot;wash&quot; + kata &quot;down&quot;).[citation needed] and it has also been used to describe events such as the Flood<br />
<br />
<br />
So WoW: Cataclysm aka WoW: Down the drain?<br />
<br />
That would sure explain a few things :D<br />
<br />
*Disclamer: I'm not opposing any of the changes blizzard are making to the game due to the fact that I don't care. Thus this post is purely for humoristic purposes.*</div></div><hr />

man they've said time and time again you kill arthas...but NOT the lich king. <br />
If the entinity known as the Lich King can still live - then I'm pretty sure he can inhabit another body...<br />
which... would open up all possibilites...<br />
he can do whatever he wants.(which means blizzzard can)<br />
<br />
Can you imagine after we defeat(weaken) Sargeras...the lich king takes over his body? <br />
LAWLS... now that would be an epic fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well... all the content and the mechanics ,etc.. is so so good ! <br />
but!... if the blademaster is the next hero class i think it must be just for the Orcs and maybe draenei(just b'cause the alliancie must have this same hero class, i mean a hero class only for ONE faction ? =/ that simply isnt fair) .. obviusly the blademaster looks so amazing been an orc ... not any other race =) <br />
<br />
archdruids =O .l.. sounds interesting <br />
i dont know .. maybe with an epic quest line the druid can transform in an archidruid <br />
and if it isnt that way ...it will suck! i mean c'mon two classes very very similar? but not the same ?<br />
druids? and archidruids? nobody is gonna play with the druids if that happens...<br />
<br />
the leveling mechanics that he posted ... was simply amazing ! <br />
<br />
<br />
in my opinion the next expansion will be the maelstrom, after that emerald dream and then maybe something relationed with Sargeras and the burning legion<br />
but... after all that.. i really believe that wow is not gonna died.<br />
<br />
maybe a new history begins... who knows =)</div></div><hr />

If thats true wouldnt we kill the lich king before we killed Sargeras? <br />
<br />
Blizzard can clearly make whatever lore they want on the fly, because until we actually take on Sargeras and defeat him they can continuously create other zones (like outlands) to travel to to take on basically whatever they want. Make more underlings of Sargeras (kil'jaedan and Sargeras) or he can make pacts with new enemies. Maybe ressurect old enemies that had direct ties to Sargeras. The limit isnt in what Blizzard can make or create as far as people to fight, its their ability to keep the players interests in the game without blowing things out of proportion. Fights need to become interesting and immersive, not so much of the &quot;dps race&quot; that there seems to be in almost all the fights. Think Illidan, Vashj, Vezax, Yogg, Archimonde, Twin Emp(aq40) and some of the other boss fights that were more than just ok avoid this 1 thing, keep your tank alive, and dps a lot.<br />
<br />
I love this game, but have really only been playing it since TBC and there are times now where I find it dull. Half the fights and Ulduar and all the fights in Naxx except 1 are basically DPS races. Sarth +2-3 is an awesome intense fight, Malygos while not hard was fun because of the 3rd phase, it was very different. Vezax has super unique elements to it that make it very fun to do, same with yogg, but i think that sooner or later Blizzard will run out of ways to keep it interesting and thats when their &quot;unknown&quot; mmo will come into play. I think WoW as a major staple for MMO'ers is over the hill and starting its journey to its grave.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing's Lair has been marked as being on Kezan (the isle in the Southern Seas on which Undermine can be found) by Blizzard on their old maps.</div></div><hr />

Deathwings lair has been at various places at different times in Warcraft history. At the moment, however, he is situated inside Grim Batol. We learned this in the book which was released just before WotLK was released: Night of the Dragon.</div></div><hr />

Personaly,id prefer it to be a expansion where we go back to see what kalimdor looked like before the sundering,but with this evidence,it looks like it might just be a very big content patch. the instance portals could be those odd portals found in duskwood,azshara,hinterlands and ahsenvale,being 3 different 5 mans and 1 raid.<br />

Dude IOQD and DK starting area were B4 Blizz knew to make em, and the list isnt fake it's been right so far with BC and WOTLK,a nd list was made by OLD blizz team, not the new 1 EDIT: and if its named wowmaelstrom it would be maelstrom so maelstrom and south seas incorporated, Mabey Emrald dream will be CoT thing? ??? ??? who knows</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go with Maelstrom then once that is done make new race Pandaren make Heroclass Monk / Brewmaster w.e makes you happy..Dwarfs Trolls And Pandaren can be them thats that. In wow ATM we need a new healing class some maybe something that does dmg to heal the raid would be nice like a monk class or something around that so yeah do that for the Hero class at least as far as xpac its Maelstrom and Deathwing / Sargeras shouldnt be there, although for a huge shits and giggles make Sargeras move the SWP to the Maelstrom and then start the xpac by redoing it like WOTLK 2.0 lolololol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that list, what smart people are saying is true: show me the links, or its fake.<br />
<br />
Anyone unable to comprehend the sheer massiveness of the internet is a moron. If the stories about that list are true, then there will (100%) be evidence of it's existence prior to it's 2007 posting somewhere on the interwebz. It's been quoted here at least 20 times, in one thread, on one website, in one day. I myself have seen this list countless times all over the internet, and in every single thread it is disputed due to the lack of any evidence whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Fake list is fake until proven even marginally genuine.</div></div><hr />
