Tanking<br />
Swipe Nerf / Thunderclap and Tank Threat boost<br />
We had already nerfed Swipe before I saw this conversation, because it was pretty far out in front of other tank AE dps. Thunder Clap's coefficient is something like 0.10 and that could probably be 0.20, which would bring it more in line.<br />
<br />
We are also talking a lot about just buffing tank threat across the board, because we've heard a lot recently that it's still too twitchy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/))<br />
<br />
Tanking classes cannot AE Tank anymore<br />
That actually isn't an intended change. We don't want AE healing to be trivial. I'll use some examples:<br />
<br />
A) Pile of 20 whelps. Go ahead and AE tank this and ask your dps to AE too. You probably don't even need Shield Slam.<br />
<br />
B) One giant. I wouldn't use Thunder Clap at all on this, except as needed to keep the debuff up. We want Thunder Clap to be terrible for holding single targets. (I don't think many tanks would argue this point.)<br />
<br />
C) A pack of 4 targets that you plan to burn down one at a time. Here is the biggest point of contention. Thunder Clap should be fine for establishing initial aggro (though Shockwave will be better), and it should be fine for keeping add #3 off of the healer. But you should feel like you have to go to town with single target abilities on add #1 that the dps are all focused on. Then you should switch attention to add #2. In Lich King, it was too easy to just hold this whole group with Thunder Clap spam, and to be fair, the dps would just AE as well.<br />
<br />
D) The same pack as in C, but this time you decide to CC add #3 and #4. In this case, you should be able to live fine without Thunder Clap at all (unless you really need the debuff). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/))<br />
<br />
[...] Right. If you are trying to AE tank and a bad dps is attacking the wrong target and dies, we call that justice. If you are trying to AE tank and a healer pulls aggo, then threat generation is just too low and we need to buff it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/))<br />

Cannot macro Lifebloom while in Tree of Life on Beta<br />
This is a (dumb) limitation of our macro system, where it gets confused if you have two spells with the same name. In this case, the Tree of Life Lifebloom is actually a different spell than normal Lifebloom. The macro tries to cast (normal) Lifebloom, sees that you can't because it isn't allowed in Tree of Life, and just bails. Lifebloom is not the only spell in this category.<br />
<br />
We understand why this is bad and are working on a fix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026396849/druids-heals-need-help/))<br />

The fact that they added a pet for Mining is really awesome though.<br />
<br />
I believe that's the first vanity item added to a gathering profession. It would be cool to see one for Herbalism/Skinning at some point although I don't know how they'd do it. Maybe a Bee for Herbalism and a... Enchanted Rug (?!) for Skinning.</div></div><hr />

Is it based on reputation earned after the expansion is launched within guild raids or is it just individuals in the guild totaling 55 or more exhalted factions once again for reputation earned after the launch? As that would mean getting the achiev as soon as they become active?<br />

All i can do is lol at Ghostcrawler trying to explain how the new tanking mechanic is going to work. I do welcome the return of old school tanking over aoe-zerg-fests; don't get me wrong. But if you've played long enough you remember a time when warrior tanks didn't even HAVE thunderclap available in defensive stance, and then it only hit a whopping 4 targets!<br />
<br />
The fact a dev is now sitting and having a little fireside chat with us to &quot;explain&quot; how its going to &quot;work&quot; is hilarious to me on soooo many levels.<br />

Oh, and for the unidentified sources I would expect that both Goblins and Worgen are going to get their own vanity pet variety (as with cats/snakes/moths etc etc).

The fact that they added a pet for Mining is really awesome though.<br />

I believe that's the first vanity item added to a gathering profession. It would be cool to see one for Herbalism/Skinning at some point although I don't know how they'd do it. Maybe a Bee for Herbalism and a... Enchanted Rug (?!) for Skinning.<br />

<br />
<br />
Why would you switch from engineering. We get our own helms, we get our own special gems for them, we get a cool mini pet, and if nothing else I will still keep my rocket boots parachute combo. While the benefits of eng are not as cut and dry as others, just look at some of the cool stuff they get. <br />
<br />
In the upcoming 4.0 nerf (blah, will get flamed for speaking out against the great allknowing blizz but whatever)<br />
Our hand enchant gives 885 bonus armor, while armor on most things has been reduced. Do you realize in cata how big of an improvement that armor amount is. Even if it seems really small. <br />
The Ilevel359 gloves have an armor of 2998, with my engineering I can move that to 3883, which is over the ilevel359 tanking chest piece. So basically armor has been reduced on most items. Therefore our ability to put a large amount on an item is a very big benefit if you are tanking. <br />
<br />
Personally I won't give up my engineering, the personal gems, helm, other bonuses are just too perfect. Plus it's fun. Oh and don't forget the mote extractor. I am pretty sure there was a blue post that it wouldn't be going away. So we will still be able to gather tons of materials quickly.</div></div><hr />
