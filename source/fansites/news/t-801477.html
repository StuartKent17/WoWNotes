Blizzard Product Slate &quot;Leak&quot;<br />

The image appeared on MMOGamesite.com (http://www.mmogamesite.com/news/blizzard-product-slate-leaked.html), apparently this is an english MMO site based in China and I already know a lot of people will hate me for reporting that news. The document itself is probably a slide from an internal presentation to executives and/or shareholders, and seems to be 8 months old according to the date at the top. <br />
<br />
Battle.net 2.0<br />
<br />
BNET2 - Well, that's the Battle.net we now use on WoW. <br />
BNET2MapMarket - This is pretty self explanatory, but I'm a little surprised by the timeline. <br />
BNET2 3rd Parties - The end-game with Battle.net is as far as I know to compete with Steam. One of the best way to do that would be to use the new platform to distribute a popular game, and if that game was an upcoming Call of Duty title the Activision/Blizzard merge would suddenly make a lot of sense, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Starcraft 2<br />
Nothing really new here, but I have no idea what SC2 Phoenix is. <br />
<br />
Diablo 3<br />
Target release date in a year makes sense. The 2 expansions aren't really a surprise but I wouldn't take it as a confirmation, that's usually the kind of stuff you mention in company meetings with the higher-ups to make everyone happy. <br />
<br />
World of Warcraft<br />
<br />
WoWMobile - Done/in-progress with the mobile Auction House and the upcoming extra features. <br />
Cataclysm - Well, we all know about that. <br />
WoW Brazil - Portuguese translation of the game. I already heard a couple of rumors about that and at this point I'm 99% sure it's true, this is one of the reason why I think this document is legit. (The 2 others being the TCG Game and Titan) <br />
WoW X4 - 4th expansion in a year and a half sounds very plausible. <br />
WoW TCG - TCG Game, this part will probably remind you of one of my old posts ... The Future of World of Warcraft: TCG (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/695208-Future-of-WoW-TCG-Realms-Lag-ICC-Progression)<br />
WoW Movie - I'd say the timeline is off because the document is a few months old, before Sam Raimi decided to work on other projects before the Warcraft movie (but I still want to believe).<br />
WoW X5 - 5th expansion a year and a half later, nothing surprising.<br />
<br />
<br />
Titan<br />
Yeah, that's Blizzard's new MMOFPS and I might have hinted at that (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1876-MMO-Champion-acquired-by-Curse) in the past but I don't have a lot of extra information about it and the release date is just an estimation. Don't assume that it will be released by the end of 2013 based on that document, it would be very stupid.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
The document is probably legit, even if it's already a little old it still confirms and backups a couple of information I already mentioned, and mentions the portuguese translation for the first time in public. Don't take it as a hard fact and don't bring it up too much on official forums but I think it's an interesting piece of information. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Forum Titles are here!<br />
The new titles are finally deployed on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forum.php) and I'm only a few months late! Hopefully it will make the regular forum posters happier and it will be an awesome opportunity for the 40 new moderators I will promote tomorrow to ban hundreds of people trying to boost their post count. See the list below, the post count required for the last 3 titles will remain secret for the moment, it's ridiculously high anyway. <br />

Patch 4.0.3a Hotfixes - November 30<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />

It is no longer possible to bypass Fatigue beyond the borders of Dun Morogh (looking at you here, death knights).<br />

<br />

Last, but certainly not least, we sit down with World of Warcraft Lead Systems Designer Greg Street to discuss the class and systems changes in Cataclysm.<br />

<br />
<br />
Dungeon Quest Experience Reduction<br />
We are applying a hotfix today to all level 1-60 dungeon quests for Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms dungeons which will significantly reduce the amount of experience they award.<br />
<br />
While dungeons should remain integral to our evolving storylines, and great places to collect gear in cooperative environments, we need to make sure each player’s questing progress remains relevant as dungeon quests are completed. In many cases we’re seeing players enter dungeons to complete quests, only to come out ahead of the leveling curve for the zones they’re in.<br />
<br />
This change should allow players the opportunity to reap the benefits of running dungeons, while not outpacing the leveling flow from levels 1-60. At this time there are no plans for making any adjustments to dungeon quest experience for Outland, Northrend, and level 80+ Cataclysm dungeons.<br />
<br />
You can find a list of all of the latest hotfixes here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1232869<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Level Changes<br />
The Cataclysm has wrought changes to many facets of Azeroth and the dungeons found across the world are no exception. As many of the zones throughout the world now have new level ranges, the dungeons within their borders have been adjusted to match, and the items that drop within those dungeons have had their stats changed accordingly.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of all 1-60 dungeons and the level range at which each should be explored, followed by the minimum level required for entry in parentheses.<br />
<br />

City Tabards and reputation in dungeons<br />
If you are wearing one of the new faction tabards (e.g. Thunder Bluff, Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc.), you will only receive reputation gains for that city/faction when in Classic (1-60), Northrend (70-80), and Cataclysm (80-85) dungeons. Outland dungeons will not currently provide reputation gains for the &quot;home city&quot; faction you are championing; this is intended.<br />
<br />
Also, just as a heads up, if dungeon mobs and bosses are trivial to you, you will receive less reputation than if they are within your level range. This is just to ensure that players who exceed the dungeon's intended level range can still benefit from championing a specific faction, but aren't given a distinct advantage over those who are of the appropriate level and are unable to solo the content. This should also help encourage players to improve their reputation in dungeons more appropriate for their level, rather than running lower level content solely for the reputation (which isn't a bad thing by any means; we just want you to enjoy the content designed for your level range, too). :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138803/city-tabards-and-bc-dungeons))<br />
<br />
Aesthetic minor glyphs<br />
We've enjoyed the few that have been made and really hope to continue on with them. A big issue is always time constraints, but the biggest hurdle is probably that we don't have the capability to alter spell effects directly with a glyph yet. The tech doesn't exist for us. Swapping out models, like the two you mentioned, are somewhat easy as long as we like the actual effect and want it in the game. Changing fire to be colored green though, while awesome, isn't as easy.<br />
<br />
Some of the things you mentioned are certainly possible, some are quite like never going to happen, and some we just need the tech to pull it off. :)<br />
<br />
We do indeed though hope to keep adding aesthetic minor glyphs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138763/aesthetic-glyphs-great-start-blizzard))<br />
<br />
Upcoming realm status page<br />
The page itself has undergone some key improvements. Realms will now be sortable by status, name, type (Normal, PvP, RP, RP-PvP), population, locale (i.e. time zones: Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern), and current queue. Also, when you're logged in, there will be a separate tab that will display the most relevant realms based on where your characters are, allowing you to quickly reference the status of the realms on which you play. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138738/realm-status))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sunshine will!<br />
<br />
I question whether a company like Blizzard would even TRY to predict releases 5 years out, but the stuff in the immediate future is likely true. :]<br />
<br />
Edit: I mean, then again, it's not like it's surprising or hard to write up a tentative schedule. They just ask themselves &quot;How many expansions do we want and how long should be between them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev team says &quot;2 and 1.5 years&quot;, boom, very early schedule created.<br />
<br />
It's probably all true.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget that this schedule hasn't been applied to Blizzard time yet, so when you do the conversion, the end of 2012 is ~ 2014, and 2015 is code for 'canceled project'.</div></div><hr />

No one wants to run them 15 times an hour to break even to questing. I have never heard someone legitamitly and seriously say, 'OMG those instance quests gave me SO much exp, I am so infuriated that my orange quests from the area I was in are now yellow or green and that I might have to spend less time completing them to move on to the next zone to level up more even though I got an awesome boost from an easy instance...........whhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?' See, even in that scenario, it's impossible for that hypothetical person to even imagine not liking the, basically, one time extra boost that instance quests give.<br />
<br />
But no. Thanks Blizz. I understand wanting to force people to view as much as your crappy new water effects by leveling as slowly as possible and having no survivability whatsoever, but can you give us a break? Maybe a 12% break?</div></div><hr />

I do think the last expansion on the list means the last expansion of WoW entirely, as it coincides with the Titan thing as well. Good way to hand over the torch.<br />
Naturally WoW will still be kept up and running, and receive patches now and then, but someday it is bound to run out of expansions, and the engine won't reinvent itself for eternity. I think that is a good year for the switch between the two games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the beginning of a 1 1/2 year per Xpac is interesting. And promising, and I hope that that is true. No one wants to sit around for a year raiding the last true content patch for an expansion waiting for the next one to come out. WotLK was a great failure in content pacing, and it seems that Blizzard has learned from that mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what worries me though is that someone allready made a post that bungie + blizzard would work on titan.. which would mean it to be a console title? cause bungie has yet to make a working pc game and to think of it blizzard has yet to make a working console game xD.. all speculations ofc, but mmofps on consoles... would be meh at least with current hardware (and no new xbox or ps in sight yet so you cant really design an engine for that either)</div></div><hr />

It's never been officially confirmed, but all of the rumors have stated it, and Boub apparently believes them if he states it like that here.<br />

If Boub thinks it will be an MMOFPS, it probably will be. He did, after all, know about nearly every major announcement before they were made.</div></div><hr />

Why not? They released SC2 and a WoW expansion this year. I'd doubt they'd be released the same quarter, but an expansion and a new game in the same year isn't exactly unfeasible. If they move the SC2 expansion to quarter 3, it'd be available roughly a year after SC2, which is reasonable, and then they'd get boatloads of xmas sales for Diablo</div></div><hr />

Whatever Blizzard may say about their project, they fully intend for it to wholly replace WoW. Notice how there are no wow expansions slated after #5? The traditional fantasy / rpg elements work best with the MMO genre. Blizzard knows this. WoW wouldn't have nearly the wide-scope appeal it does now if it were something like Halo. <br />
<br />
This isn't to say the new MMO won't be something completely new and separate from WoW, I just highly doubt it will leave the RPG genre. Maybe edge out a bit on fantasy but it will probably still be an RPG at its roots. But that's just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems from the start, the plan was to make 5-ish expansions, ultimately ending with a max level of 100. I'm sure some of you have seen the list of zones and expansions that has been around since before vanilla, and it's been followed pretty closely so far.<br />
<br />
Seeing the word &quot;Titan&quot; listed on its own at the bottom is definitely the most mysterious and exciting thing on there. It may or may not be an MMOFPS, but with Blizzard's capabilities and the time frame involved, it really could turn out to be anything. Without a doubt, it will be awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More than likely it's just a code name for their MMO. it's very typical when companies are developing some thing well in advance to give it a generic code name. For example, Windows '95 was simply called &quot;Chicago&quot; until it was ready for release. The only significance of the word is that it's easy to remember, and every one can talk about the &quot;thing&quot; without revealing what the &quot;thing&quot; is. For example &quot;Where's Bob Jones? I haven't seen him around lately.&quot; &quot;Oh Bob? Yea, he's been over at the other site, getting the story team up to speed on Titan.&quot; <br />
<br />
Also, I have no idea why Boub would take issue with a release date that's still three years out. I mean, if that's the window the document says, that's almost certainly the window they have targeted. Whether or not they'll actually hit that window is impossible to know, of course, but there's no reason to doubt it since it's not exactly all that ambitious.</div></div><hr />

Unless blizzard has stated Titan is in a new universe, I don't see why they wouldn't use the well established SC Universe and Lore.<br />
<br />
They've already stated that it's completely unrelated to any of their existing IPs.<br />

I have never heard someone legitamitly and seriously say, 'OMG those instance quests gave me SO much exp, I am so infuriated that my orange quests from the area I was in are now yellow or green and that I might have to spend less time completing them to move on to the next zone to level up more even though I got an awesome boost from an easy instance...........whhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?' See, even in that scenario, it's impossible for that hypothetical person to even imagine not liking the, basically, one time extra boost that instance quests give.<br />
<br />
But no. Thanks Blizz. I understand wanting to force people to view as much as your crappy new water effects by leveling as slowly as possible and having no survivability whatsoever, but can you give us a break? Maybe a 12% break?<br />
<br />
Maybe some want to enjoy the new zones? and not rush through everything.<br />

<br />
MOST of the stuff on the list is completely obvious. They've said they want to reduce the time between content patches, which results in faster WoW expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems from the start, the plan was to make 5-ish expansions, ultimately ending with a max level of 100. I'm sure some of you have seen the list of zones and expansions that has been around since before vanilla, and it's been followed pretty closely so far.<br />
<br />
I think it will take years before people understand this, so I will use bold with some caps:<br />
<br />
The &quot;LIST&quot; of SUPPOSED WoW expansions was CONFIRMED FAKE.<br />
<br />
I'm not picking on you specifically, but a search on the internet reveals this in the first thread ever to appear on the topic: http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21&amp;mid=119012268058738816&amp;page=3&amp;howmany=50#msg1251302069155658271<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello everyone. I'm the OP, if you haven't noticed.<br />
<br />
With the announcement of Cataclysm, it seems the lifespan of my list has come to its end.<br />
<br />
It's odd how this list, which I wrote myself out of boredom on a fall morning, has taken on a life of its own.<br />
<br />
I wrote it in September of 2007, but some swear they saw it during the WoW beta in 2004. To boot, CMs on the official WoW forums deleted this list every time it popped up - at least until this year, when they suddenly stopped caring.<br />
<br />
Some things I predicted came to pass. Others didn't.<br />
<br />
I was sure I'd be proven right with a Maelstrom expansion, but it seems Blizzard has combined light elements of both the Elemental Planes and Maelstrom into one expansion. Gilneas and Grim Batol are in from the Maelstrom expansion, while the four elemental planes have been introduced - some only as raid dungeons, disappointingly. Why Blizzard has reduced the Firelands to a raid and expanded Uldum into a full zone is beyond me. If you ask me, they should have followed my lead.<br />
<br />
etc etc<br />
<br />
There is also -nothing- in this list that says WoW will end after the fifth expansion. In fact, many, many, many WoW players hate the RTSes from Blizzard and FPSes as well. Most people in my guild go &quot;LOLFPS&quot;.</div></div><hr />

But we still have to wait another year to get it? WTF blizz. playable demo&gt;&gt;&gt;3 years&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;release. Thats a long ass wait for diablo fans. I mean polish is one thing, but if you polish a turd long enough its still a turd. Diablo 3 better be mind blowing amazing, or the chart better be wrong. This sort of thing for investors/executives/shareholders is 100% plausible. <br />
<br />
Its mind boggling that Blizz could keep any secrets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jukaï</div><div class="date">2010-12-01, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the &quot;MMOFPS&quot; thing is just rumormongering really. Whatever Blizzard may say about their project, they fully intend for it to wholly replace WoW. Notice how there are no wow expansions slated after #5? The traditional fantasy / rpg elements work best with the MMO genre. Blizzard knows this. WoW wouldn't have nearly the wide-scope appeal it does now if it were something like Halo. <br />
<br />
This isn't to say the new MMO won't be something completely new and separate from WoW, I just highly doubt it will leave the RPG genre. Maybe edge out a bit on fantasy but it will probably still be an RPG at its roots. But that's just me.<br />
<br />
No, it's most likely not designed to replace WoW. Even so, stating that 'after' #5 we see no more predictions of releasedates is not a valid argument.<br />
<br />
Remember that Blizzard is a company renown for trying 'new things'. When RTS games we're in it's infantile state, Blizzard made Warcraft. And together with Westwood's Command and Conquer series, Blizzard made RTS games become a mainstream gender. They tried the same with adventure games with Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans, but with it's cancelation that strategy failed. Then the company tried to gain a foothold in the world of FPS games by producing Starcraft: Ghost. We all know how that went.<br />
<br />
Five years later comes World of Warcraft, from the depths of their chamber. A game designed to hook in by the then slow rise of the MMO gaming genre. Though it had already a few titles and companies in it, that 'market' was still a niche. With World of Warcrafts release and popularity, they've now gotten that strong foothold in adventure gaming Chris Metzen always wanted. This by turning MMO's into a new mainstream type of game and even a whole standard for the industry to come.<br />
<br />
Notice how the FPS genre is still a 'target group' missing from Blizzard's list. Whatever the form of this new and freshly designed game from scratch; it will target the wallet of FPS gamers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Titan?<br />
<br />
Good find. I recall that Blizzard have said, just once, that it's secret MMO was based on an existing franchise. People did speculate that it could be Halo if it were to be a MMOFPS, but people really couldn't see Bungie really going for it.<br />
<br />
Also, since the project is around a year old minimum already, surely something would've let slip by now if it was a colab development. However, would Blizzard really trundle into the FPS market, with their first entry being an MMO version, without assistance from a company that knows what they're going with FPS games?<br />
<br />
It's all as plausible as it is unplausible. <br />
<br />
Either way, I loved Planetside for it's tactical teambased gameplay. Maybe Blizzard can show SOE how this should be done as well. Remember SOE, MMO=active development, especially when there's a subscription fee. No active development? You better get your asses in gear to make it free-to-play without some gimmicky marketing campaign.</div></div><hr />

I actually hate how boring Starcraft II's multiplayer already is and I heard that Heart of the Swarm was already being worked on while Wings of Liberty was being released but we still have to wait a whole year from now? Get your ass in gear blizzard. Additionally they have been advertising Diablo 3 for at least as long as Cataclysm yet it is still gonna be a year before we might see it? I know it's basically all theory since that timeline thing isn't supposed to be official but the kind of incompedence suggested by that timeline doesn't surprise me.<br />
<br />
It's going to be a pretty boring 2 years for Blizzard products after the momentary fleeting joy of Cataclysm has left. That and knowing that Blizzard puts less and less work into all it's mainstream stuff and more and more into useless money grabbing crap like the PetStore (see how we didn't get a pet this years aniversary but 2 pets were put in that stupid store for idiots to buy?) makes me loose faith in the whole companies work ethic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing the word &quot;Titan&quot; listed on its own at the bottom is definitely the most mysterious and exciting thing on there. It may or may not be an MMOFPS, but with Blizzard's capabilities and the time frame involved, it really could turn out to be anything. Without a doubt, it will be awesome.<br />
<br />
Given most of you don't work in software development, I would say you don't realize you're reading wayyyyy to much into this. This chart is some product manager's vision of the future. This doesn't account for funding for these projects let alone execution of the software development. And if Blizzard is like most software companies, WHICH THEY ARE, they don't have an unlimited supply of resources meaning if one or two of these slip, anything afterward could slip, be parred back or killed altogether.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, product managers look 5-10 years out. Software development doesn't because the technology changes too fast. This chart is a vision of the future, not a roadmap of what's to come and when. Still exciting to see what they're thinking though.</div></div><hr />

As a sidenote, it could have been called project yellow so stop speculating on its meaning as a word. The project name is nothing special to know about and is needed when different depts. are talking to each other and one department is not in on the project, they still need to refer to the project by a name even if they are not told what it is.<br />

<br />
If they made an MMORPG they would just be competing with themselves and it wouldn't do them much good in the end. With an MMOFPS, they can not only have most of their current fan base playing the game, but also a slew of new customers who dont care for WoW or MMOs but like FPSs. That way WoW and the New MMO &quot;Titan&quot; can co exist and Blizzard makes a hell of a lot more money.<br />
<br />
I still hope some day we get a Starcraft MMO though.<br />
<br />
As for WoW expansion release dates... yeah those things will be coming out every 2 years instead of 1 1/2 years as usual. Blizzard always delays things. Though I wish D3 would come sooner than a freaking year from now.<br />
<br />
And for those saying WoW is ending after the 5th expansion because a 6th is not listed... maybe they just don't know what to do for it yet or they don't have a time period for release date yet? Doesn't everquest have like 20 expansions?</div></div><hr />

SC2x2 and D3. Means a big-up hype at Blizzcon 2011. But what bothers me is that WoWx4 is only a year and a half away?! That's far too soon.

Dude, D3 is in late 2011 not 2012. Only if they suffer delays then it could be pushed into 2012. But for now, it looks like late 2011 which is understandable. Cataclysm is coming out now and it wont make sense to launch a new game early next year. So late next year is very feasible.</div></div><hr />

^this, what the hell blizzard? Diablo 3 was announced around the same time as cataclysm, they are not the same teams working on them, Battle-net has been hinting and is all hyping up Diablo 3 but its still a freaking year away? go to hell blizzard indeed.</div></div><hr />

They'd give us another 5 levels, probably re-work 60-70 like they did with 1-60 this time around and throw in some new areas. The team that did Cataclysm simply switch to the next expansion right from Cataclysm release. WoW is so polished and fine tuned now that it really isn't a major drama for them to come up with enough content to justify an expansion in 1.5 years. They're so good at this now and they know exactly what they're doing.<br />
<br />
It does however suggest that WoW only has 2 more expansions left within it's natural life before Blizzard hope we all move onto the next big thing. So enjoy WoW while you can.</div></div><hr />

NOT an existing franchise. NOT. NOT.<br />
<br />
They specifically said the new MMO was NOT an existing franchise. It's possible that some how they meant &quot;not an existing **Blizzard** franchise&quot; but it's more likely that it's a completely new IP, because they've talked in interviews about how difficult and time consuming it is to come up with all of the lore for the new IP from scratch, and how different that has been from WoW, where a lot of lore and setting was already in place.<br />
<br />
For the record, Blizzard's never said anything about it being an MMOFPS. That's pure speculation based on nothing. I know you didn't say anything about the FPS angle, I'm just throwing that out there. This being MMO champion though, I'm sure people have already forgotten where they heard the FPS idea in the first place, and accepted it as some thing Blizzard has actually said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just stated recently that they want a faster pace of development from the two year window that they had with Wrath -&gt; Cata. If you think about Wrath, almost half of it was spent with ICC being the highest level content, which is about six months longer than most people actually had interest in it. The only reason it took so long from ICC til Cata is because of the massive task of creating Cataclysm. Since they're presumably not going to completely revamp the existing world every time a new expansion is released, 18 months seems pretty achievable. Previously their goal had been to pump on out every year (at least, that was an Activision goal).<br />

<br />
It's already been in development for 3+ years. By the time it comes out, they won't be trying to switch WoW players to the new MMO, they're be trying to switch players of some one else's MMO back to their new one. SW:TOR is already going to take a large chunk out of their bottom line, and once the bleeding starts and people see their friends leaving in droves, it will be much easier for them to leave as well.<br />
<br />
From a business perspective, it's actually coming out much later than it ought to, but these things do take time, especially when it's Blizzard that's involved.</div></div><hr />

Instead of focusing on releasing good, enduring content that can last 2 years, they opt to release short, crap content that lasts half that, then instead of what WOULD have been a free patched in raid, ala Zul'aman/RS. We'll instead get that crap shoveled in as the first raid in a $40 expansion.<br />

Not even the link you posted says anything about Halo being now published by Activision, because it was part of to Microsoft to let go Bungie, that Microsoft would own everything in the Halo franchise. So Titan has nothing to do with Halo, since it is owned by Microsoft, and not Bungie, even if they made it. Without this, Bungie would still be owned by Microsoft.<br />

You shouldn't expand a real article with your fantasies. Microsoft owns Halo, it's publishing rights, it's future, it's past, everything. Not Bungie.</div></div><hr />

Gotta say I agree with the nerf to dungeon experience as it was enough to gain you at least 2 levels or so if youre lucky which screwed up the levelling progression. Means it wont affect the quest progression as much. Also gotta say that the next two expansion may be coming out a lot quicker than we think taking a look at the chart which could be a good and bad thing I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But wasn't their a quote from one of the Blizzard guys that &quot;The new mmo&quot; wasn't even going to be ANNOUNCED until 2012? <br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking to GameTrailers' Geoff Keighley, Blizzard Executive Vice President of Game Design Rob Pardo said that while prototypes of the game are being played by a 50-person dev team, it is unlikely an announcement about the project will be made before 2012&quot;<br />
<br />
I would have to think that a 2013 release seems extremely unlikely. We got the official D3 announcement in 2007/2008....<br />
<br />
I am just bummed that there isn't a WC4 on the horizon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that's the case it'll be a campaign / mission pack to add to SC2. They won't release SC1's multiplayer with the new system... Then you'd have two prime multiplayers competing for the competitive spotlight. That makes no sense.<br />

Personally I think this is unlikely. The chart lists nothing after Q4 2015. Should we take that as a sign that Blizzard is planning to close up shop and go home? Most likely this chart is projections for the next 5 years. If the schedule here is accurate, then WoWx6 would be in roughly 5.5 years. It's just not on the schedule yet. <br />
<br />
I agree with Boub that it's probably legit, but would caution anyone taking anything too seriously past Q4 2011. Any kind of serious planning beyond a couple years or so out is basically fantasy. Those release time frames are goals, and likely highly subject to change. Stuff like WoWx5, SC2x3, and Diablo 3x3 aren't even in development yet. There's no way they can accurately predict a release schedule. <br />
<br />
So basically it's interesting, but largely irrelevant info. They confirm some already announced dates and provide some very rough estimates for later releases. The Titan stuff is interesting. It confirms a likely release date at some point in the reasonable future. My guess (if the chart is real) is official announcement next BlizzCon. Roughly two years out from release seems to be Blizzard's preferred announcement window for new stuff (less so for WoW expansions, because they're on a shorter schedule).</div></div><hr />

If you think about Wrath, almost half of it was spent with ICC being the highest level content, which is about six months longer than most people actually had interest in it. The only reason it took so long from ICC til Cata is because of the massive task of creating Cataclysm. Since they're presumably not going to completely revamp the existing world every time a new expansion is released, 18 months seems pretty achievable. Previously their goal had been to pump on out every year (at least, that was an Activision goal).<br />

It's already been in development for 3+ years. By the time it comes out, they won't be trying to switch WoW players to the new MMO, they're be trying to switch players of some one else's MMO back to their new one. SW:TOR is already going to take a large chunk out of their bottom line, and once the bleeding starts and people see their friends leaving in droves, it will be much easier for them to leave as well.<br />
<br />
From a business perspective, it's actually coming out much later than it ought to, but these things do take time, especially when it's Blizzard that's involved.<br />
<br />
As i remember they didnt talk about expacs, they talked about a shorter time span between content patches</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have to invent a new tech to do this and you know that. When someone has the Glyph of the Penguin, the Penguin model with completely different model and color will be shown for everyone. Duplicate redfire.tga change it to greenfire.tga and make sure greenfire.tga will be shown when someone has the Glyph of Green Fire.<br />
<br />
How do yo know that? How do you know that it's the same bits of code that tell fire what color to be as tell polymorph what model to use? You have a lot more inside knowledge of Blizzards engines and tools than most of us it seems. Seriously, these guys develop one of the more complex pieces of software on the market. If it was easy and they could make a little bit of QQ stop by doing it, don't you think they would? It seem to me that it's a relatively trivial bit of code to check for a glyph and if it's there have Polymorph: Sheep be a completely different spell (Polymorph: Monkey), than to have a glyph tell a spell to be exactly the same as normal, but with a different model. I don't know any better than you do though.<br />
<br />
And of course that's not the only issue. What about casting animation? When you cast a fire spell you have a casting animation. That animation has fire dancing around your hands. Maybe it's easy to make the fire you shoot out change color based on a gylph, just like it's easy to make you turn things into monkeys instead of a sheep, but it's hard to make the cast animation change based on a glyph. It'll look stupid if you have orange fire dancing around your hands while you cast, but shoot out green fire. I don't the answer myself, and I really doubt you do either. You want it to work in a certain way, so you've decided that what you want must be easy and Blizzard is deliberately not doing it. I'm not sure why... people seem to have this idea that Blizzard hates them personally and doesn't do some things just to make them sad or angry. <br />
<br />
It always amuses me how people with little or no software development experience (or for that matter 3-D modeling experience) love to sit in forums and tell Blizzard how easy it is to do things. Hell I *have* software development experience and I have no idea how hard or easy it would be to most of this stuff. It all depends on how their tools and engines are setup. Never having worked on *this* piece of software I can only guess.<br />

Edit to add:<br />
<br />
Probably sound like an idiot but-<br />
I'm confused about the WOWx4/x5 is.. #5 being the 5th xpansion? What's #4? :|<br />
Um.. the fourth expansion? There's only been three... The number system they're using here considers the base game as x0 so:<br />
WoW: vanilla<br />
WoWX1: was the first expansion (BC)<br />
WoWX2: WOLK<br />
WoWX3: Cataclysm<br />
WoWX4: Unknown 4th expansion<br />
WoWX5: Unknown 5th expansion<br />
Look at how Starcraft and Diablo are numbered.</div></div><hr />

I of course had he's gear enchanted, and tryed to upgrade it as much as possible, and used Self Healing and Victory rush as much as possible, but i could solo all thrash with same ease as i could solo 2 mobs outside an instance back in vanilla, and solo bosses as if i was fighting two elites at a time. Most instances i dont need a healer for, and if i got one,(a lot of them leave cause i pull too fast, and they can't keep up, and feel useless apparantly, and im a bit arrogant i guess &lt;.&lt;) then i can pull 2-5 groups at a time, or atleast chain pull with with also 1-2 groups on me, so my dps can AoE dps their asses off (and possible reach 400-600 dps, while i rock at 1000+) <br />
<br />
what im trying to say is.. Blizzard, nerfed nearly all classes dps(if not all) so we couldn't just ZERG through all instances from Deadmines to.. well..Ulduar.. but.. mainly 1-60.. and YET i can do 1500+ dps as a lvl 60 Protection warrior in just heirloom items and blues??... <br />
<br />
Blizzard clearly made instances 1-60 too easy, i could proberly almost tank Heroics on my lvl 60 prot warrior, in lvl 70 Heroics already &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Ok, I understand taking a post made by people in an official standing out of context, it's done to manipulate a conversation in your own favour, but why in Zeus's name are you taking a post made by me out of context?<br />

Here's the part that put's that paragraph back into context;<br />

Also, since the project is around a year old minimum already, surely something would've let slip by now if it was a colab development.

Also, Activision-Blizzard only have publishing deal with Bungie. Publishing rights do not give a company ownership of the product. Ubisoft, for example, are the publishers of SOE's Planetside in Europe, but SOE handled The US side of things. You see, SOE don't have much of a presence in Europe, so they strike a deal with a company that is already based in Europe in order to handle the distribution and support in european countries. Since Activision is a Eurpean based company, this is why Blizzard are now with Activision (because without them, WoW would not have been released in Europe with the support is has had at that time, another company would've picked it up instead, but considering how long deal like these can take (see the issues with getting WoW published in China as a relavant example)europe may have been deprived of WoW for a full year after it's US release).<br />
<br />
Bungie is a private company. Any development based interaction between two completely seperate development houses is a very difficult secret to keep. Which actually brings me back to what I was saying in the post you decided to butcher.</div></div><hr />

Activision was a European Company prior to the merger with Vivendi? Since when? It was founded in the United States, and primarily operates in the United States, part of what made their merger with Vivendi Games(Which Blizzard was a part of) was the international distribution system that Vivendi Games and Blizzard had in place. I guess you can now say Activision-Blizzard is a European Company since Vivendi still owns a controlling(read: Majority, greater than 50%) interest in Activision-Blizzard, and Vivendi is a French company, but that is as European as they get.</div></div><hr />

Blunder.<br />
<br />
Edit: Duh, of course they wont be mentioned (Vivendi I mean). It was a really bad example. Should've left it to the China publishing example and left it at that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that is a reason I'm inclined to not buy into this release cycle. In interviews/statements made leading up to the release of TBC(an expansion every 12 months), and again with WotLK they claimed that their target was a new expansion pack every year(which some took to mean &quot;calendar year&quot; rather than 12 months. <br />
<br />
Besides the fact that everyone I know that works in the Gaming Industry who I've talked to, and the people they've talked to within the gaming industry about this &quot;leak&quot; as well, have all come back with the response of &quot;I've never heard of a gaming company having a single planning document tracking all of their projects, particularly that far in advance.&quot; As the risk factor on such a document getting leaked(as being claimed here) would be huge.<br />
<br />
It's probably a fake, somebody is trolling with great success.</div></div><hr />

.<br />
<br />
I think the interesting thing is that people keep repeating the &quot;MMOFPS&quot; thing even though there's literally no reason at all to think that's the case. Blizzard hasn't said that or hinted at it. This document doesn't say that or hint at it. Where did Boub even get that concept from? If he's got reliable sources on that then it's much bigger news than a projected release date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless the plan is to do the same amount of content in smaller, shorter cycles, it's reasonable to assume that also means shorter cycles between expacs. Shorter cycles between expansions means they can sell more expansions over time. By itself, I guess their recent comments could be taken either way, but considering they've already talked in the past about shooting for one expansion per calendar year, 18 months between seems to be a reasonable internal target. IMO, the only reason we didn't see Cataclysm in that time frame is because of the massive old world revamp.</div></div><hr />

Whatever Blizzard may say about their project, they fully intend for it to wholly replace WoW. Notice how there are no wow expansions slated after #5? The traditional fantasy / rpg elements work best with the MMO genre. Blizzard knows this. WoW wouldn't have nearly the wide-scope appeal it does now if it were something like Halo. <br />
<br />
This isn't to say the new MMO won't be something completely new and separate from WoW, I just highly doubt it will leave the RPG genre. Maybe edge out a bit on fantasy but it will probably still be an RPG at its roots. But that's just me.<br />
<br />
They haven't even start on Expansion 4 you expect them to list them all out? To what end of time?<br />
I seriously doubt they will replace WoW. Just like Starcraft wasn't intend to replace Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Either way after those two we're getting &quot;The Fallen Hero, The Final March&quot; and returning to Northrend to deal with the now corrupt Fordragon. Then we see Warcraft IV.</div></div><hr />

However, that also does not mean that it's cut in stone and a guarantee. That may well be what Blizzard has roughly estimated as their plan for the future, and any company such as Blizzard will try and roughly chart their future and try to not have too many conflicts as to when their products are coming out. However, as with anything, all of this is subject too change.<br />
<br />
I like to use the &quot;WoW plan&quot; map thing that has been thrown around for years. Yeah it's been around and some like to try and quote it as gospel, some say it's fake. I usually fall into the catagory that I'm sure Blizzard made a plan a long time ago as to how they'd like their expansions to come out. And with all the hype that Warcraft has, all the history, Blizzard would need to have a rough plan for the future. But that does not mean that they cannot change the plan to satisfy a their player bases. <br />
<br />
It could very well mean that the next expansion is planned for 1.5years from now and gets released 2 years from now. Add that considering we had ICC about 6 months too long, maybe they are pushing up their expansion dates up faster so people won't get as bored as they have been with this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering the two just signed a 10 year deal with bungie making the game and activisionblizz publishing. Bungie will still own the IP though, and seeing as microsoft still has a stake in Bungie it could get really interesting. Let's say they do make this game, and activisionblizz put it out their as their next big mmo. At the end of that contract Bungie then has the game. So I don't know how that would work out for them. <br />
<br />
Either way there are going to be some bigger issues at hand, like crossing that console pc market. Holy crap microsoft is going to get rich off those two companies (if they weren't enough already). <br />
<br />
I personally don't see the bungie/activisionblizz title going console. That creates so many problems, and it creates lots of licensing issues also. There have been games that have done it, but there is a reason you don't see that many that pull it off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Halo, quite obviously, isn't new IP. <br />
<br />
Plus you know Microsoft owns the Halo IP. They have their own game publishing studios etc. Bungies last official Halo was reach, but they have even said if Microsoft wants to make more there is nothing they can do about it. They just won't be the ones making it. Having played every single Halo game I will certainly try out any new ones. I think Microsoft has done a damn fine job on the publishing part, and the technology part.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The same Bungie that signed a 10 year publishing deal with Activision earlier this year for all future Halo games? The same Activision that merged with Blizzard? And the fact that the Halo MMO that was being developed by Ensemble Studios, then cancelled due to &quot;company politics,&quot; until THE SAME DAMN MONTH (April 2010) THAT BUNGIE SIGNED WITH ACTIVISION was called, get this, Titan?<br />
<br />
No they did not sign a deal with Activision for all future halo games. That would be impossible for them to do anyway. The reason Halo poped up so much in that article is they wanted to say &quot;HEY WE GOT THE GUYS WHO MADE HALO!!!!&quot;, not because they are doing anything with Halo. Ask yourself why did Microsoft let them go so freely? Anyway the Halo MMO wasn't ever officially announced by microsoft, at least to my recollection.</div></div><hr />

Also rather than take away from the WoW audience, they can tap in to the COD/Halo/Borderlands audience and keep two big scale MMO's running at the same time. It makes a lot of sense, although probably isn't what WoW fans hoping to move to the new MMO were wanting. <br />
