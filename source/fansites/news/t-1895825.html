Ion Hazzikostas Interview<br />
We had the opportunity to talk to Ion Hazzikostas (Lead Game Designer) at the Blizzcon this year. <br />

<br />
Legion Pre-Expansion Patch<br />
<br />
The Broken Shore scenario picks up exactly where the cinematic leaves off. <br />
There is a massive joint Horde and Alliance assault on the Tomb of Sargeras. <br />
In the patch before Legion, there will be a demon invasion of our world, with invasions happening all over the world. <br />
The forces of Azeroth decide that they need to launch a counterattack and cut off the corruption at its source.<br />
Players will get on ships and arrive at a beach assault that has different stages. The stages are completed by the raid group as a whole, you are destroying Legion fortifications, killing demons, killing their major lieutenants and generals as you fight your way up the hill from the beach to the foot of the Tomb of Sargeras. When you get there, there will be some fateful and eventful things that they don't want to spoil yet, but you do not completely succeed at stopping the Legion invasion. All of this will be playable during the pre-expansion patch. <br />
The Broken Shore scenario is flexible, scaling anywhere from 1 to 20 players, so when there aren't as many people starting later in the expansion it will wait for a few minutes and then start, maybe with additional NPCs to keep the epic feeling.<br />
The pre expansion patch is on a similar timeline to previous expansions. <br />
There will be a pre-release patch coming out a few weeks prior to the Broken Isles becoming accessible, which will include the invasion events.<br />
Anyone who has pre-purchased Legion will be able to make their Demon Hunter and play through their starting experience during this patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Challenge Mode Dungeons<br />
<br />
The difficulty of challenge mode dungeons should be able to scale endlessly, but there will be a cap on how high the loot goes. <br />
For example, if a Tier 20 challenge mode dungeon is very hard to complete, they may cap the loot potential there, even if there are a couple of groups that can go a little higher. This is somewhat like how current challenge modes have a gold timer that is designed to be attainable by virtually any reasonably balanced group. Players can try for even faster times for prestige or leaderboard ranks, but there aren't any more rewards.<br />
The goal is to have leaderboards for the new challenge mode dungeons, focused on the highest tier you clear rather than how fast you are doing it.<br />
If you are a skilled fully Mythic geared player, you will be able to do a very high tier challenge mode dungeon and they want to give you a chance to get loot comparable to that. <br />
Loot will be in a range of item levels, somewhat like what Mythic dungeons offer in Patch 6.2.3. While there is a chance to get items equal to the best ones from Mythic raids, that is not the default expectation. <br />
This will complement high end raiders gameplay, not replace it. For players who do Normal difficulty raiding, but actually prefer a smaller group setting, this could replace raiding for them.<br />
Each player will be able to get one keystone per week. There may be opportunities to get additional ones as a bonus, but one will be the baseline. <br />
If you fail to beat a timer on a run that you have initiated, your keystone is depleted. The depleted keystone can still be used to start additional runs, but those runs won't give a loot chest at the end. <br />
If you are trying Level 6 Halls of Valor and just barely fail, you will get a Level 6 quality reward chest for your group at the end of the run, but you now have a depleted Level 6 Halls of Valor keystone. You can try again and if you manage to beat the time, you will upgrade your keystone to a fresh empowered Level 7 keystone that will give you loot. <br />
The team wants to avoid frustrations such as having a tank disconnect and being done for the week, but they didn't want players to take the same keystone and run the same dungeon over and over for all of the rewards. <br />
The quality of the loot you get from the weekly jackpot is going to be significantly higher. There is a possibility of getting a lucky upgrade from the regular runs, but at some point your main goal will become the weekly chest.<br />
There aren't going to be unique challenge mode armor sets, but it is likely that there will be Artifact appearances tied to the challenge mode dungeon system. <br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding<br />
<br />
Raid sizes are staying the same, with Mythic at a fixed 20 player size. <br />
Cross-realm Mythic raiding unlock time will depend on how long a tier is lasting and where things stand overall for the game. <br />
By default, Mythic raids will remain closed to cross-realm raiding at release. Part of that is to preserve the server first races, as well as a sense of guild identity. <br />
The idea of a top guild on a specific server is one of the few server specific things that remains and the team wants to make sure it stays and keeps a sense of prestige. At some point it will make sense to unlock cross-realm raiding. <br />
The game will have two raid zones at launch and a number of content patches following that.<br />
The team is talking about moving away from single monolithic raids that are very large and having a tier that has a couple of separate raid zones that complement each other. <br />
Rather than having one 13 boss raid like Hellfire Citadel, what if there was a 6 boss raid and a 7 boss raid, somewhat like Serpentshrine and Tempest Keep. This would allow for more options, diverse environments, and flexibility. <br />
<br />
<br />
Questing and Reputations<br />
<br />
There are going to be a wide variety of rewards from the world quests. Some examples include gold, experience, Artifact Power, crafting materials, things that benefit your class order, rare mounts, rare pets, and gear. <br />
Doing organized raiding will be the most consistent source of high quality gear, followed by dungeons, followed by stuff in the outdoor world.<br />
The world quests on your map will exist without picking up a quest from the emissaries in your class hall. You should be able to see how much time remains before they are gone. The emissary quests are just there to give you some structure. <br />
You can do as many of the world quests as you want. At some point you will start clearing out your map and you will have to wait for new ones to appear. <br />
The quests that offer more attractive rewards aren't going to appear as frequently as the smaller quests. Most players will pick and choose what is most exciting to them and leave the rest alone. <br />
It shouldn't feel mandatory to clear out all of the world quests. The emissary quests help you to know when you have done enough. <br />
In Legion, reputation is earned more like it is Tanaan and Mists of Pandaria. The team wants to get away from the more grindy kill reps where you just spend hours in a group AoEing things. <br />
There may be one or two reputations that require grinding, something like the Timbermaw, but most will not be like that anymore. <br />
The main way you will earn reputation is the emissary quests. You might get thousands of rep from the emissary quest, but individual world quests might give you 50 or 100, allowing you to work towards them faster if you want to. <br />
Reputation rewards will be pretty standard, some convenience items, some cosmetic, some power items, while still avoiding the Mists of Pandaria model that required reputation and Valor. The items are likely just going to cost gold and be unlocked by reputations. <br />
If two different level players attack a mob, it will almost exist in two states. A level 102 player would see a mob as level 102 and the level 106 player will see the mob as level 106. Most of the time when you are leveling you don't worry about actual numbers, just percentages. The mob will do more damage to the level 106 player than the level 102 player, but the percentage of health it takes off of both players will be the same. The goal is for you not to even notice it is there. <br />
While the leveling zones will scale, you won't be able to join friends in the middle of the main quest line in another zone. The idea is for you to both progress through a zone at the same time, regardless of level. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifacts<br />
<br />
The team is pretty far along with all of the Artifacts at this point. They are aware that some players that have a spec that they play that doesn't perfectly match what they want out of their Artifact. Frost Death Knights have asked for a choice between a 2H and a Runeblade. Choice is nice, but it would come at the expense of the identity of the Artifact.<br />
You will be able to transmog your Artifact to look like something else, but you can't transmog something else to look like your Artifact. <br />
In terms of transmogging to legendary items, a world where everyone has transmogged to Warglaives or Thunderfury isn't right. Those weapons were designed with an iconic look and to be rare. It is still an open question though. <br />
Artifact fist weapons are definitely a concern. The team is making sure sheathing works better with them, as well as making them more visible with your combat casting animations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The team knows that droughts in content are the worst thing for players, but their focus is on getting Legion done as soon as possible.<br />
You won't be able to earn flying in Patch 7.0. The world is being built with flying in mind and players will definitely be able to fly later in Legion. Players can begin working on the flying achievement in 7.0 though.<br />
It seems likely that another Heirloom upgrade level is coming in Legion, but they aren't sure if they will do it immediately in Patch 7.0.<br />
<br />
<br />

Legion Hunter Changes Feedback<br />
One of the developers (https://twitter.com/AndrewChambers/status/663578495889469440) responded to the Hunter changes feedback on Reddit tonight.<br />
While i do know that the base design of artifact weapons can transmoggable i feel some specs like priest, warriors, hunters look .... iffy and not great if there could be a patch and rework some of the design choices then that would be good<br />
Do you mean a patch which changes the art of the base item? Thats very unlikely to happen. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3rxqy0/world_of_warcraft_legion_game_systems/cwsxwqd?context=3))<br />
<br />
I'm a bit sad that all the awesomeness that belonged to demonology warlocks went to Demon Hunters I've played a Demo Lock since forever and all the aspects that made me like this class so much are going to be removed. No longer Metamorphosis and Demonic Leap, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe everything that made me play a Demo Lock was all the Demon Hunter like abilities they possessed. I'm now torn between keeping playing a shadow of my former main demo lock or make a demon hunter my main.<br />
We understand that these changes may cause some hard choices, but hopefully once you get to play it you will find the spec equally enjoyable, just maybe for different reasons. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3rxqy0/world_of_warcraft_legion_game_systems/cwsy01l?context=3))<br />
<br />
... and yes, Survival has Wing Clip...<br />
But do they have volley that is the true ultimate question!<br />
It may come back as a talent for the other specs, doesnt make sense for survival having a melee weapon. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtj5l1?context=3))<br />
Also instead of arrows, it could be say a ton of javelins. but either way i just want volley again<br />
Thats a pretty hot idea actually, ill sleep on it (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtj5l1?context=3))<br />
did you pull any inspiration from diablo 2's Amazon?<br />
Honestly no, there was more than enough awesome in wow to pull from. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtj5l1?context=3))<br />
<br />
RAPTOR STRIKE LIVES ON<br />
Funny story, it wasnt called Mongoose Bite originally, until watcher &quot;announced&quot; the melee survival spec at gamescon, then you all asked for it to come back. I couldnt change its name fast enough! (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtjh6j?context=3))<br />
<br />
I'm really interested to see how you guys are going to manage to make Survival Hunter different. There's a large amount of melee already in the game and it covers a lot of available design space. It sounds like we'll be incredibly bursty like a rogue, but hopefully we'll be a little more survivable (due to mail) yet still hard to lock down (two damage sources plus master's call and movement options).<br />
if we werent able to make it feel unique we wouldnt have pulled the trigger on it. Traps and pets help alot. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtm8zy?context=3))<br />
<br />
Is there a reason why Survival's 'Flanking Strike' has the exact same text and effect/cooldown as Beast Mastery 'Kill Command'? I wasn't sure if that was an error or intentional for them to be the same.<br />
Slightly out of date, we are constantly working in this stuff. It will be an attack with you and your pet attacking at the same time. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtjitg?context=3))<br />
<br />
So, rangers in GW2 have an ability with 1h swords, I think it's their 2 skill, where on the first press they leap backwards out of melee range, and on the second press within a few seconds, leap back into melee range and attack the target.<br />
Disengage + Harpoon. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtjk0b?context=3))<br />
<br />
thanks for bringing Mongoose Bite back, but is there more to the Survival rotation that building up vast charges of MB ? I know you can't share too much, but some idea would be nice !<br />
Its more split 50/50 between hectic weaving between MB and other skills while trying to proc more charges, and more steady useage of other skills while waiting for MB charges to build up. Its hard to express gameplay in words. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtjo66?context=3))<br />
<br />
these changes are making me consider rolling a hunter alt to check it out, BM sounds right up my alley<br />
Glad to hear it. I also just finished a pass on Dire Beast so that it summons the correct animals for all the old zones too. Exhausting, but Hunters need love too! (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtjw6f?context=3))<br />
Whoa wait what? Are you saying Dire beast will not be a random Beast from anywhere in the World, but will be a random Beast from the Exact zone you are in? If that's the case, RP players are going to love this!<br />
Thats correct (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtpwej?context=3))<br />
So, question on Dire Beast. Since it's BM's only chance to regain focus now, are we extra-extra-extra-screwed on fights where our pets simply can't reach a valid target? This happens every now and then (sometimes bugs/glitches, sometimes valid pathing issues like the target flying) and I'm not sure its avoidable in WoW's engine. It's going to really suck if we've got the same limitations as a melee class when these situations arise.<br />
Fair point, may look into a solution that doesnt require Beast to attack, maybe just a focus per second while guardian active kinda deal. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtjw6f?context=3))<br />
Maybe have some kind of pet communication channeling ability where you and your pet communicate and that generates focus? I'm kinda unsure, that seems like quite a predicament.<br />
Personally hate channeled abilities unless its things like Arcane Missiles. Will be sone very active talent options for focus generation to make up for this if you need it. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtlgh2?context=3))<br />
Has this been adjusted so we might not, say, summon an elekk somewhere small and indoors and suddenly not be able to see our target anymore due to giant elekk butt?<br />
Ive scaled everything as best i could, if you see sonething thats too big let us know. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtkeet?context=3))<br />
<br />
I dreamed that black arrow was going to debuff targets and if they died with the debuff they came back as skeleton, just like in WC3.<br />
I think youre going to like what you see. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtjxzd?context=3))<br />
<br />
Will Survival be getting an interrupt?<br />
Of course.<br />
I assume it will be a short cooldown one like most other melee, and not 20+ seconds like most ranged interrupts.<br />
Yea, more like Pummel. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtk418?context=3))<br />
<br />
Is Barrage still sticking around or is it rip?<br />
Sticking around, but will be more AOE focused like it looks (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtkcwi?context=3))<br />
<br />
Does the MM mastery still have the condition of standing still or is it just a passive bonus now?<br />
No more standing still requirement. Trade off though is you have to stand still while casting aimed shot. Fits the fantasy better. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtl0ld?context=3))<br />
Will there be a talent choice to opt out of that? I don't like cast times and having to stand still. Since MM seems to be supposed to be the spec for the fans of the old SV spec I think there should also be an option to include the mobile feeling of it.<br />
Probably, think lock and load combined with aimed shot. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtl0ld?context=3))<br />
<br />
Please tell me that with Survival getting Wing Clip back that one of the talent options will be something like the old Improved Wing Clip or maybe a more reliable version of the old Counterattack. Those were abilities that really felt great in the old 0/21/30 PVP spec back in Vanilla when I got Grand Marshal. Also, hunters have very low armor and dodge (and no parry) compared to vanilla, will that improve at least for Survival if they are going to be in melee now?<br />
We arent really at that tuning point yet but will get there. Improved WC was cool, ill see if the pvp guys would be interested. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtlk30?context=3))<br />
<br />
With some of these old abilities coming back, any chance for Eyes of the Beast? The one that the hunter channeled to control their pet and use its abilities for ~1 minute?<br />
I can look into it, from an engineering standpoint it was a total mess and really broken. If we can re-engineer it safely then maybe, but no promises. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtm07n?context=3))<br />
<br />
Love it - any word on MM utility without a pet like Roar or Master's call? Passive heals etc. has this been figured out or still in the works? <br />
Snares are an integral part of your rotation now. If survivability in the wild is an issue we will address it, but i want you to feel very high risk/high reward. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtmdlt?context=3))<br />
Awesome! Also please tell me the purple shots Sylvanas was shooting in the cinematic is the new arcane shot??! Would be so cool to have better visuals on the shots themselves. Thanks for hanging out and answering questions.<br />
Sounds pretty cool, ill ask our VFX guy. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtmdlt?context=3))<br />
<br />
In the BM changes, there's a note saying that &quot;summoning a beast reduces the cooldown of Bestial Wrath by 15 seconds.&quot; With Dire Beast having a 10 second cooldown, it seems like you'd be able to Bestial Wrath up indefinitely. Is this intended or will Bestial Wrath be given a longer cooldown/lower duration to compensate for that? (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtmzlt?context=3))<br />
BW should feel like its up more aften but not indefinitly. All just tuning points for us to work on now we have the foundations solid.<br />
Is the frenzy / focus fire (and go for the throat/invigoration) dynamic gone for Beast Mastery as well?<br />
Yes. Didnt like how it felt to interact with the pet in this arbitrary fashion. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtmzlt?context=3))<br />
<br />
Hunter defenses have always been based around not getting hit- as a melee class thats not gonna be a viable option. What sort of defences utilities are we gonna see to offset that?<br />
If survivability during combat is an issue we will resolve it with some form of passive. Unsure if thats actually necessary yet, they have a lot of cc and pet based mitigation. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtn1yu?context=3))<br />
<br />
I have a question. Or concern, I suppose, about BM Hunter. I know that the fantasy is all about beasts and controlling them (and also that the preview was just to give us an idea of concept) but I feel a bit worried that Cobra Shot was the only ability I saw that actually makes use of the gun. I'll still have an assortment of meaningful attacks with my gun that aren't auto attack, right? I like focusing on pets but I don't want Blizzard to overdue it and make the spec about nothing but pets + cobra shot and the badass hero with the gun be incidental while the pets get the whole spotlight. Beastmastery is about teamwork.<br />
This is only the core spells, and talents will build on it. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtoj98?context=3))<br />
<br />
Does Survival have a way to build focus? from what we've been told so far there doesn't appear to be a focus builder.<br />
No, but while using MB youre pooling focus. If this is an issue we may make RS a builder, either baseline or talented, but so far it works well. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtpeym?context=3))<br />
<br />
Not to undermine all your hard work, but... any chance we could get a glyph for dire beast to summon a pet from our stables? As beast mastery, I almost always have a spirit beast out. It would be cool to see some of the non-spirit beasts I have from time to time since they never get much use.<br />
Theres tech required for this but its already in the works, likely built into a talent. (andrewchambers (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3s2od3/official_hunter_preview_for_legion/cwtplgg?context=3))<br />
<br />
You answering all these extra questions has really put some extra faith into the Blizz machine. I won't lie, I've been pessimistic for a while about you guys. But even if I'm not thrilled about changes when it comes to one of my preferred classes, it's nice to get some actual communication from you guys. Please keep it up!<br />
I cant promise that we can be this reactive all the time, all these changes take up most of our efforts, but we really want to ensure you are all heard. I lurk here daily.

This is probably the worst (ABSOLUTE FUCKING WORST) argument they can make where EVERY single retpaladin will get Ashbringer, EVERY SINGLE FROST MAGE will get the staff of the First Guradian etc. It is so absolutely fucking flawed I can't even understand why they still make that argument. <br />

<br />
Blizzard sounds like a broken record and quite frankly, this crap is getting old. They fail to close the gap between the end of an expansion and the start of the next expansion time and time again. They've been stating they want to close this gap since Dragon Soul and they've failed each time and only made these gaps longer! What the hell is going on? Why aren't these things being planned out better? Blizzard lost it. I mean, WoD had the least content out of every expansion... and it cost $10 more! That's disgusting! They knew that they had very little content planned for WoD that they tried to stretch out the raid content by locking Blackrock Foundry at launch.<br />
<br />
WoD was such a terrible expansion that I can't see myself returning for Legion, the expansion I've been waiting for since BC/WotLK. I'm sorry, but at this point I'm done. WoW is just a shadow of its former self. There's a reason why subs have only declined after each expansion (after the end of WotLK) and why WoW sits at a subscriber count they didn't have since the beginning of Vanilla. It's just not delivering content as good as they did for Vanilla, BC and WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Not hard to understand. Being a &quot;serious raider&quot; doesn't equal to be dumb, stupid, etc.<br />
<br />
Especially if he is a serious raider, he knows that kind of problem more than someone who isn't. You can have some serious challenge that doesn't means it's a challenge because of things outside that raiding zone.<br />
<br />
A serious pvp player, while doing everything to improve his pvp (like when they needed some stuff from high end raiding), can see that some stuff shouldn't be needed to do.<br />
<br />
For example, if you could just re-run the same raid non-stop for more and better loot in one week like the new challenge modes seems to be, the &quot;serious non-raiders&quot; would complain about that, since it wouldn't be exactly an option and more like a must have since better gear will improve your challenge mode chances...<br />

Not exactly, specially since we're talking about serious raiding.<br />
<br />
And you're being really single minded saying that they can't add anything that rewards character power progression that way.<br />
<br />
Isn't ridiculous that you can only loot a raid boss once per week, but could basically get better stuff non-stop in one week from a challenge mode? That do sound ridiculous when they're trying so hard to achiev the oposite (plenty of diferent activities to reward the same power). One activity is clearly standing above the rest this way and since it's a power progression activity, it gets a huge interference in the others that are power based.<br />

<br />
In a world where most (if not all) of the challenge in a raid didn't come from gear power, that would be ok. But lets just accept that most of the challenge in the game just come from gear power. As soon as you get gear, you start to ignore stuff, get phases done faster, etc.<br />
<br />
So, yes, if you're doing a raid seriously, more power is a requirement. That's why people will run the same raid tons of time with alts+mains to focus more gear on mains, etc. if you just say &quot;no problem, you can get the same gear 6 months later&quot;, than you shouldn't be talking that much about serious raiding, power progression, etc.<br />
<br />
An online game is more about the players itself, so yes, the same way you're forced to go with the meta in card games because otherwise you have no chance. The same way you have to go FotM classes in pvp to get higher, etc... and that's why the game devs usually have to draw a line, nerf this, buff that, etc. to keep things more or less in check and in a good place for most players.</div></div><hr />

Rather than having one 13 boss raid like Hellfire Citadel, what if there was a 6 boss raid and a 7 boss raid, somewhat like Serpentshrine and Tempest Keep. This would allow for more options, diverse environments, and flexibility. <br />
<br />
So they listened to my prayers to bring back the good old TBC and WotLK raid numbers style. I am very happy that I will have a chance to choose from 2 raids at the beggining and not doing one stupid raid for 4 - 5 months like in fiasco called WoD. <br />

I really don't value the opinions of 'serious' raiders who can't fathom going outside the raid to get loot upgrades. <br />

Anyways like Ion said raids will still be the most reliable source for high end gear, regardless if you theoretically could get it in CM dungeons as well.

How is it endless? He said the weekly chest is where the good stuff will come from and very rarely the actual dungeon itself so that doesn't feel mandatory to me.

If you improve your rank in CM, you'll get more stuff. It's seems to be over for that week if you can't improve your rank. And it's something that is power based, so &quot;serious CM players&quot; would need to go to raids to improve their ranks in that week, but you can't loot a boss more than once per week anyway.<br />
<br />
If you're going to the serious/hardcore route about raiding, the chance to get one loot that will improve the raid for the group in that one week already changes everything.<br />
<br />
That's why people were going for LFR when you could get some really powerfull trinkets or the tier sets. It's one thing that if you could that in that one week, would change the game a lot for your entire group.</div></div><hr />

But you can't do it endlessly, did you not watch the interview? He said that the stone is depleted if you fail and while you can recharge it there will be a limit and you get no loot at the end. So I really don't see why you're complaining. Would you rather see people progress through the 'gearing up phase' in 1-2 weeks tops then have the WoD situation where everything outside raids feels irrelevant because it doesn't provide good enough rewards?<br />

<br />
Hahaha go figure, but that's what happens in a MMO. If it was a single player, that wouldn't matter that much.<br />
<br />
It's like the old 10/25/10h/25h raid problem. People would feel the need to do it all to improve their highest tier progression, but also lead to some problems with the game itself that would direct impact Blizzard product and game development (people getting tired from the same raid content way faster than they should), so they came to fix it asap with Cata same lockout.</div></div><hr />

While I think this is unfair and a bit of generalization, there is some truth there.<br />
<br />
I'm glad they're doing this. I'm glad they're adding more relevant things to do. I'd rather a few people whine about everything being mandatory than nearly everyone whine about there being &quot;nothing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And basically what this boils down to is a few people being afraid that without gear they'll lose their competitive edge. I mean, the only way Blizzard could counter this is to make mythic raids scale (or players scale) to a certain ilvl, flat, and then there would be no more complaining about &quot;mandatory&quot; activities for &quot;hardcores.&quot; But then they'd just complain that now getting gear feels pointless.<br />
<br />
There is, literally, no pleasing people like that.</div></div><hr />

He said that the stone is depleted if you fail and while you can recharge it there will be a limit. So I really don't see why you're complaining. Would you rather see people progress through the 'gearing up phase' in 1-2 weeks tops then have the WoD situation where everything outside raids feels irrelevant because it doesn't provide good enough rewards?<br />
<br />
Thanks but no thanks, I'd rather have things to do the days I'm not raiding as well.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaing about that, I'm &quot;complaing&quot; (not exactly, just pointing in fact) about this kind of attitude you and others had that went really fast to the old &quot;snowflake hatred&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can recharge and do it again also for loot. It doesn't matter if it's not 100% chance, it's there and we're talking about contents that are power progression based challenges.<br />
<br />
Can't see why this way would not lead to the same &quot;gearing up phase in 1-2 weeks tops&quot; or even faster and then raid/cm (or pvp). There isn't much they can do to about things to do when you only talk about one kind of progression (power based). It gets worse when you take into consideration things like group size, etc. and the need to make them all interesting.<br />
<br />
It's a MMO game, not a single player game. Big player group power based activities work a little bit diferent than single player ones. The &quot;meta&quot; changes with it, etc. It's about how many times you can do one thing to get ahead of others in the same time. Options for the same goal should be balanced, not better/worse.<br />
<br />
Remember the complaing about &quot;chores&quot;?<br />

<br />
Also from what I understood you can only get 1 keystone per week if you are not lucky, and since you cant really downgrade it you will always reach a level where its too hard to get any reward so your chances to get gear will always be limited.</div></div><hr />

If you stop and check the game, you will see that is clearly more stuff to do than you ever had. The problem is that the game is getting older and older. Older players alread did most things a new player have to do, they only have the new content. Other than that, you now get more and more players that are focused in doing only one thing in the game. No matter if it is power based or not.<br />
<br />
When you focus in doing just one thing, then you really run out of things to do and fast. And now you're in a multiplayer game, where the developer needs to release new stuff in an average interval to be reasonable to most players and you get sad because you need to wait to get more of your only one thing. Someone who logs in WoW only for pet battles, will get bored fast because they need to wait for a new patch to go hunting new pets, etc. and will say that there is nothing to do in WoW.<br />
<br />
Not to mention player's pace and other variables that get into it. Some people will say that there is nothing to do anymore because they don't raid normal or heroic or mythic and they're done with that raid within their raid dificulty. Or they've alread clear mythic and there still 3, 4 months before the next patch/tier. The same time you'll have people that even after 6 months will say that it's not time yet for a new tier because that would render their current progression (and fun) to nothing. And the list goes on.<br />
<br />
They did that with pvp not being that much based in gear power, wich is what most people asked, but you need time to change a few years of players mentality. So you can go from doing it for gear to doing it for titles, cosmetics, etc. and not feel pointless.</div></div><hr />

&quot;If you fail to beat a timer on a run that you have initiated, your keystone is depleted. The depleted keystone can still be used to start additional runs, but those runs won't give a loot chest at the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The quality of the loot you get from the weekly jackpot is going to be significantly higher. There is a possibility of getting a lucky upgrade from the regular runs, but at some point your main goal will become the weekly chest.&quot;<br />

This is exactly like how normal dungeons have always been only it allows a continuous progression rather than being done with them altogether once you reach entry level raid equipment.<br />

And no quite frankly the only bad type of player for the community are the ones part of the extremes. I.E those who don't want relevant loot to be obtainable outside raids and those that want everything for as little effort as possible.<br />

This is a very very very very bad idea. It means players will only want a sure thing, which will result in unreasonable expectations for pugs. It will result in players who don't have experience being completely left out of challenge mode runs. It will result in paid boosts for loot instead of fun experience.<br />

When you fail you get loot but the keystone gets depleted and you can still start a new run with no loot, what you missed to quoute or read is that if you manage to sucess that run in the time frame the keystone will be charged again and you can do it again for new loot. So the only punish will be that you have to run the dungeon 1 time without getting any loot, or until you complete it, which is perfectly fine.</div></div><hr />

I get your argument (extremely valid btw), but I also think Blizzard is trying to make failure mean something again. <br />
<br />
Death is a minor inconvenience and outside of the rare Ra-den attempts type boss, there's not really mitch penalty for failure, which takes away some of thrill of success.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, sry. You're the one being aggressive (or even the passive-aggressive) kind here, wich are the worst ones for any community.<br />
<br />
In any moment I've tried to bash you, to try to make you look like a stupid person, to diminish you in any form while you just going rampant on cliches about &quot;snowflake&quot; and etc.<br />
<br />
Like the other talking about crybabies, etc... Just people trying to say that they're better and the others are stupid/crap persons.<br />
<br />
Back to the point, you've quoted exactly it. The depleted keystone, while won't give you a chest at the end, will give you another shot at finishing the dungeon in time and recharging it to the next level, where you are elegible again to get stuff. And even tough you're aiming the weekly chest, you will still be able to get loot upgrades from the regular run as long as you're elegible for getting it. The way the loot system works now and will work in legion is that you will be able to loot something that is very high level because it will be a chance.<br />
<br />
Unless you can only get ONE chest per week, not matter how hard was the tier you did, you'll be able to climb it and loot another weekly chest (for that tier). Otherwise the system would get weird really fast, as you'll only do it if you want to beat the ladder, but since they're not weekly, most will prefer to do it when they could get a higher lvl chest next week.<br />
<br />
This is all diferent from how normal dungeons are or have ever been. We never had normal dungeons giving loot with the same power as raids do. They're always behind, even challenge mode bags didn't. So there are plenty of tests and feedback they need to get for it to go ok with the rest of the game and everything else they deem important (like the burnout effect in WotLK).<br />
<br />
Part of the reason they actually give information about what they want to do for the next expansion is to gather feedback and reactions. So, yes, if they didn't think about this situation, they'll think with the feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeap, but like all things, they need to be balanced with each other. Otherwise you would just create a new one &quot;only progression&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's what they do with arena/rbgs/bgs. They're always striking to get a balance between them (while keeping the fact that there is a huge gap between a group of 2, 3 or 5 players and a group of 10 or more).<br />
<br />
That's what they'll need to do with this new type of challenge. Specially with the variable that it's a power based centered activity, unlike pvp wich isn't all based in power progression (and more on fair competition).</div></div><hr />

Your whole argument is based on a group that can continue progressing without failing, not only is that going to take an enormous amount of time but you're also going to run in to a hardcap where you literally can't go any further before you have more gear. And since the only way to get gear is to run said CMs you can't use that keystone anymore.<br />
<br />
Want to use another party-member's stone? go for it, but you have to rank it up all those times again to get to a gear level where you can get upgrades. Once again, going to take a very long time to farm this way.<br />
<br />
Not to mention you completely missed the point I was making with the resemblance to normal dungeons. You say there's always a chance to get loot, I said that's how its always been. If you don't like it you should look for another game to play.<br />
<br />
Considering most of your posts have been disregarding everything said to make your argument work though I don't imagine you'll change your views regardless of what's presented. Ergo, I'm done.</div></div><hr />

That is a big problem. So when player tries, but fails, trying again and succeeding doesn't reward player. Instead he must succeed again to be rewarded. So to overcome failure he must succeed twice in a row. That is assuming he finds someone with charged keystone to do it.<br />
<br />
Too many pointless blocks to discourage players from trying. I don't see how this is a good idea, but I see plenty of reasons (listed in my previous post) why its a bad idea.</div></div><hr />

Yeah dude, you're the best, others are crap. You're done. Thanks for all your service to the community pointing out that someone is actually talking/giving reasons to support their argument instead of &quot;i'm right, you're snowflake.&quot; and other kinds of passive-aggressive behavior.<br />
<br />
But really, wouldn't you think that serious raiders, good raiders, good players, wouldn't actually be able to progress more in one week than your average player? People can actually kill bosses in a dificulty that others would only do with more gear. More power, more chances at succeeding. That's what power progression based content is all about.<br />
<br />
Is it good that you would waste tons of hours trying to get the most out of it? Not to mention the others spent with the raid progression itself and anything else that would actually give you an edge in a power progression based activity? It's when the fun is drained out of an activity that things need to get looked at and Blizzard did from time to time, drawing the line where they deem necessary and that only happens thanks to player feedback (you're a snowflake and the kind aren't feedback). That's their goal talking about the future xpac to be honest.<br />
<br />
As you've said &quot;Once again, going to take a very long time to farm this way.&quot;. That's what the guy actually complained. The increased amount of time you'll need to put in outside of raiding... to raid.<br />
<br />
And no, it's not like the normal dungeons. You'll only get that same loot, even if it's now random itemization (not that much) in WoD, you'll not be doing it forever because there is no chance to get anything better than it's reward tier. Not matter how many times you run it, how fast you do it, you'll get that kind of reward and that's it. You'll need to change to heroic, but it will be the same and still lower than raids. Now Mythic dungeon, but still the same behavior. If I didn't like this, or this game at all, I wouldn't be playing it since 2005 without unsub.<br />
<br />
The new tiered CM are totally diferent. You can get lower, equal or even higher loot than a raid dificulty (mythic warforged would be the limit).</div></div><hr />

Punishing for failure is ok when failure is caused by player himself. Punishing for failure that could potentially be caused by other players is a terrible idea.<br />
<br />
Most players don't have convenience of tight knit guild runs, so they will pug challenge modes. If players are punished for failing to complete CM because of other players in group, pugging will be impossible. Players will want only sure things, new players will not be able to even try CMs, boosting services will be flourishing.<br />
<br />
Even in guild groups players who aren't best in guild will have hard time doing those instances because their guild mates would rather take someone better to minimize chance of failure.<br />
<br />
It is bad for everyone, except for people selling boosts.</div></div><hr />

If you are a skilled fully Mythic geared player, you will be able to do a very high tier challenge mode dungeon and they want to give you a chance to get loot comparable to that.<br />
So new CMs don't scale down gear? If they don't, it sucks big time.<br />
<br />
Mythic raiders already have enough content. Its content for 99% of other players that WoW badly lacks.<br />
<br />
If new CMs don't scale down gear and punish players for failing, it will be yet another toxic feature. Only players benefiting from it will be mythic raiders who'll be making money selling boosts. <br />

<br />
Dude, you're really bad at it and says I'm the one &quot;dangerously close to the first demographic.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can't be that obtuse to say that people at high end guilds like Paragon, Method and others (that do ALL that farming and more) are shit players when they've alread voiced their concerns from time to time when things like that arise.<br />
<br />
If they feel bad about that, imagine average players that need to fill that gap with gear power and obviously will need to put way more time on it.<br />
<br />
I've finished WoD challenge modes a few weeks (december) after WoD's launch while most were still trying and it was something that I would never want to do again if it was supposed to be every week, beating timer again and again to keep the transmogs. Of course WoD challenges are very diferent from Legion ones since we're talking about power and not cosmetics. Also dungeon timers to beat, not other player's timers, but the necessity arises when you need to get more power, for whatever reason (you're doing a large group activity, there are plenty of reasons for it). You don't always farm gear because &quot;you're shit&quot;, you know?<br />

It's like Greater rifts from Diablo 3. They'll get harder and harder and you'll need more and more gear (aside from skill and good group play) to keep going through.</div></div><hr />

Yet that's all you've been advocating this whole thread. That people are going to farm CMs because they need the gear to make raiding as easy as possible.<br />

Dude... you're really, really problematic. It's even fun seeing you trying to mock someone because they're reasoning their point/argument with you while all you do to support anything you're saying that remotely seems a point/argument is &quot;you're shit&quot;.<br />
<br />
You failed really hard to grasp any kind of point in the whole thread or even basic concepts of the game, game development and others.<br />
<br />
You fail to see that people will try to gather more power even if they're the best at playing this game. Even Method will farm for gear to meet a raid boss timer. It is the power based challenge concept that drives it.<br />
<br />
You should really stop what you doing. Your attitude really sucks. Just as a reminder, people that voiced their concerns running sites like this one, about game burnout effects in WotLK for example, now work at Blizzard. People like you, with this pitiful attitude... don't and will never be and it's not hard to get why someone like you would never get a chance there (doesn't matter if you actually want it or not, it's not the point). It's simple as that.</div></div><hr />

Says the person crying about an optional progression system being added aside from raiding and repeatedly makes feeble attempts to insult me. Cute.<br />
<br />
Have you even considered the fact that not everyone playing this game only cares about raiding? No, you probably haven't because in your mind everything should be balanced around raiding as end-game and anything that upsets that balance is bad for you so it has to be changed.

Anyway. VanishO2 is correct in assuming that competitive guilds will view everything that gives decent or better gear as mandatory at some point during the patch cycle.<br />
Uniblue is correct in stating that the game shouldn't be balanced around the smallest percentile of players.<br />
<br />
And I'm just over here laughing because I'll have more fun, challenging content to experience in Legion, and I couldn't give two hoots (or even three!) about the world first race, or the server first race. Everybody but world first loses more and more as you go down, basically, because they completely burn themselves out on something that would otherwise not be fun (and make little or no money off it).<br />

I never disagreed its not the mindset and viewpoint of the competitive guilds. However I'm amazed people are still shocked that this is something they have to do while being part of aforementioned competitive guilds. <br />
<br />
If they don't like having to get every edge possible in order to progress as quickly as possible it just begs the question why they're there in the first place. Join a semi-hardcore progression guild instead and go at your own pace, do the content you want and ignore the things you don't feel like doing.<br />
<br />
Seems like its not an option to people though so they'd rather demand the devs to change gameplay to best suit their own playstyle, despite millions of other people playing a different way.<br />
<br />
My point is I don't see the need to complain about this, it's been a side-effect from competitive gameplay in WoW since it first started, always will be unless they remove gear from the hardest difficulty modes. It also baffles me people would rather complain about more actual, lasting content after we've been starved for so long. <br />

As someone who missed most of Cata, all of MoP and came back for WoD to see rogues had not changed all that much in terms of mechanics, it is unbelievably refreshing to see Blizzard shake things up this way, for better or for worse. Outlaw looks exciting and I won't miss Combat, clearly they have some big ideas for Subtlety as well. I'm also hopeful that with the new rows of talents, and their potential interaction with rotations - depending if you take passive vs active talents - that Assassination will become less of a mindless spec.<br />
<br />
In any event, I agree. The negativity is astounding sometimes. It's like, &quot;OMG Blizz plz change spec&quot; *Blizz changes spec* &quot;OMG Blizz you changed the wrong thing!&quot;<br />

<br />
Last minute in quotes, because they weren't super-last-minute but from a design standpoint, they were. Originally the Garrison was going to be a side thing, not the primary focus, which (as many have pointed out and tried to work around) is more or less mandatory if you want to progress, especially into Tanaan Jungle. WoD is full of such things--Farahlon being cut, Cho'gall being killed off instead of the primals/void-touched story being resolved, etc etc.<br />

I love the teasers about Rogue so far. We'll see. I will say that I'm underwhelmed by the subtlety daggers. If you're all about striking from the shadows and, you know, subtlety, why do you have this big clunky rock/iron dagger? Is Blizzard allergic to designing swords and daggers that look sharp? :)<br />

New shadow priest sounds AMAZING, finally. Lore/fantasy should lead mechanics, not the other way around, and it looks like Legion's all about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And basically what this boils down to is a few people being afraid that without gear they'll lose their competitive edge. I mean, the only way Blizzard could counter this is to make mythic raids scale (or players scale) to a certain ilvl, flat, and then there would be no more complaining about &quot;mandatory&quot; activities for &quot;hardcores.&quot; But then they'd just complain that now getting gear feels pointless.<br />

And frankly, I don't care what raiders feel 'forced' to do. That's the nature of the playstyle they chose; paring down, gutting, and lobotomizing the rest of the game so they don't feel forced to do anything but raiding leaves the droves of players who don't raid with nothing to do. WoD showed about how well the player base will tolerate paying for someone else's endgame with nothing to show for it.</div></div><hr />

It seems I'm one of the few who agree with you. The concept of doing everything outside of actual raiding to help with raiding, consuming your life in the process, is hardly new (hello multiple heroic clears with umpteen alts on week one?) <br />
<br />
It's there for people who want to do it, but apart from the world/server first races, it's far from mandatory, especially with the level of RNG involved. <br />
<br />
There's also a massive misunderstanding here with how the CM loot works. The only way you could abuse this to gain tons of gear would be to just barely beat your time by enough to upgrade only 1 level. That way you can get to level 20, getting 20 pieces of loot in the process. What you're all missing is that if you're gear is currently capable of clearing through lvl 20, then likely everything before lvl 19 will be useless to you anyways! It's akin to you getting normal 5 man loot currently at an ilvl well above it. In fact the only reason you may even consider doing several final levels is if you have that random piece or two that's a tier behind because RNG &quot;loves&quot; you or if you're legitimately trying to push to a new high.<br />
<br />
I can't see how all of you are complaining about something that quite frankly sounds great. <br />
<br />
PS two side notes:<br />
<br />
Each player gets a stone, so yes, there will be value in pugging someone if for no other reason than to &quot;carry&quot; them and use their stone (unless this changed and will consume everyone's stone, ignore this if so) until you fail for more loot (again, not likely for those pushing top end because you won't get top end without 5/5 strong players). <br />
<br />
Only potential problem I see here for guild runs is tanks getting burned out. As a tank myself it's tough to help everyone with their runs and inevitably people run on alts and/or cliques form, however again, to me, the Pro's outweigh the Con's here. Ever finish raiding and your guild is full of babies who like to sleep ;) and you want to do more? Now you and the remaining insomniacs have something to do that is legitimately challenging AND offers a form of progression beyond &quot;gold&quot; or the push for server fastest, plus it's xrealm, which is great for people who've gained server diverse friends.<br />

The top raiders/guilds I've spoken with rarely complain about this kind of stuff. Their attitude is, &quot;whatever it takes to be the best.&quot; even if that means stacking almost exclusively druids... <br />
I'm inclined to think that the majority of the complaining is second-stringers and, ironically, the people that alternative gear progression would benefit the most.<br />
<br />
The people who complain the loudest tend to be world 250-1000's. They're high enough that they believe they're hot shit, but low enough that they... well, aren't.</div></div><hr />

We are almost to the point that gear is pointless as well. <br />
