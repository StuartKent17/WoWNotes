Bugged Ra-Den Kill 
It seems a group in China was able to defeat Ra-Den today due to a bug in the encounter, which may have been addressed by tonight's hotfixes. This did confirm that Ra-den does not die at the end of the encounter, which we assumed from the sound files.

WoW Subscriber Numbers and Content Release Speed<br />
You're point? WoW is still doing well compared to it's aclaimed &quot;killers&quot; GW2, Tera and SWTOR all which went F2P except for GW2 which already was. I'm not seeing a single point in this whole OP. <br />
<br />
Other than lost jobs? Or are they still employing the same amount of people that they did when they had 12 million? <br />
The WoW development team has more members now than ever before!<br />
<br />
You're seeing less time between content cycles as we continue to grow and essentially restructure our production pipeline, so that some designers within each WoW development team can focus on alternating patches. Mind you, there's no black-and-white divide in the team -- everyone's contributing in some way to each patch and expansion -- but we can have members from each team focused sharply on 5.3, while others are already working hard on 5.4 and beyond.(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/258476-blizz-form-10-k-annual-report-filed-2-22-13/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8568888242?page=6#110))<br />
<br />
WoW Changes Over Time<br />
I think any new player who has been exposed to more than a couple of hours of online gaming would feel insulted by how stupidly easy it is. The only challenge is not falling asleep within 10 minutes of starting a session. <br />
Any new player would probably try to understand what's going on, what is he/she supposed to do, how that particular class plays, familiarize himself/herself with the area where he/she's playing...<br />
<br />
Generalizations like this one aren't really helpful in these discussions. <br />
<br />
You mean about 1 afternoons work for a new intern? There have been literally dozens of constructive posts on how to do this. One very easy way of beginning to reimplement challenge to the levelling process is to re-introduce orange/red quests.<br />
Changing anything in a game is not as simple as going in and changing numbers. It's easy to pull numbers out of thin air to make an argument look stronger, but the fact is, at the end of the day it's just made up numbers. (And there's also the underlying discussion if the leveling experience should be challenging for newcomers and veteran players alike, and so on). <br />
<br />
Orange quests still exist. But keep in mind the color of the quest is only an indicator of how hard that quest will be based on your character level. If your character is level 40, and the quest you want to do is for level 44, it'll be displayed orange. While, if the quest is for level 30, it'll be grey.<br />
<br />
Back in Vanilla WoW, if you were in, say, Eastern Plaguelands, at level 50, maybe you'd be able to take quests for levels 52 and 59, while one would be yellow, the other one would be displayed red. Now, since Eastern Plaguelands is a level 40-45 zone, you'll get quests within that level range.<br />
<br />
I would have to dedicate myself to do challenge mode dungeons, as I would have to be online together with four other people. PvP is not challenging, only part of that which is challenging is high end arena and what do you know, you need time and dedication to get there. Soloing raids... is that really all that is left? In Rift you find challenge in almost everything you do, from zone events to normal dungeons. <br />
You can also do the Brawler's Guild content, which is quite challenging (particularly at Rank 7 and above).<br />
<br />
for example, once upon a time you had to play a class to really understand how to play it, all the little nuances<br />
now, i honestly believe i could roll a lvl90 (insert class ive never played) and excel at it within minutes. <br />
The game does a much better job these days to tell you the basic things about your class (such as the most important abilities of the talent spec you pick), if you pair that with the amount of online resources available, I wouldn't be surprised if someone can excel at a particular class in a short amount of time after playing with it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, shouldn't the fun of playing the game be at overcoming challenges rather than making the game be obscure at things like not telling you what Hit or Critical strike chance are for? In fact, do you think the raid content would be as difficult as it is these days (mechanic wise) if people were still trying to figure out obscure class mechanics? <br />
<br />
Just curious to see what do you mean when you talk about challenges in the game. There's the artificial challenge (understanding what your character does because the game just isn't telling you) or killing an innately difficult raid boss (for which the argument of not having enough time doesn't really work, since you could argue that finding the time required to kill a heroic boss should be, in fact, considered part of that challenge you crave for).

What's the point of vengeance Why not just make tank abilities scale better with AP in tank spec with high threat modifier?<br />
High threat modifiers were often invisible and confusing. We want tanks to care about damage not just spamming threat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319167859412586497))<br />
DPS specs scale with many stats (such as haste and crit). Tank damage (for the most part) scales from just Strength or Agi. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319167678415794178))<br />
Prob with veng is tank swaps. Taunt not updated from vanilla. Gives prior tank's threat, but not his vengeance.<br />
Because we want your attacks to matter, not just coasting on what the previous tank did. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319220978876035072))<br />
I think what Oatz means is that Tank 1 has to stop attacking so he doesn't pull back from Tank 2 which just taunted.<br />
Understand that we're not trying to make threat no longer a thing. We just don't want it to throttle the DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319223459127382017))<br />
Threat does matter. Tanks care about it+dmg. We don't like stopping attacks on switches, especially with high Veng. <br />
You get half Vengeance from taunting. We think it's fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319240492401455104))<br />
<br />
any chance of bringing back vengeance for pvp tanks?<br />
Generally when tanks are having fun in PvP, nobody else is. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318813433774604288))<br />
<br />
Do u believe that players now have to push to many buttons to effectively play their class? More buttons = less fun. Thoughts?<br />
A rotation with say 4-5 core buttons and 1-2 cooldowns is ideal. It's the situational buttons that complicate things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318800319377207297))<br />
Consider that these days the expectation is for a different AE rotation than single-target. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318800412654333952))<br />

Vanilla class (Warrior) outshined in every area it excels by a (newer) DK class. WTG Guys.<br />
So monks must be outshining DKs then? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318808650040893441))<br />
DK's can dps all day long in Blood. Warriors? No. One or the other has to change, so maybe monks will shine more down the road<br />
We don't like Unholy DKs sitting in Blood Presence. Frost generally could not afford to. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318889743851061248))<br />
Does that mean you'll be adjusting Unholy DKs but not Frost?<br />
That's the plan. Something like Sudden Doom requires Unholy Presence. Switch to Blood if you need the defenses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318894774130196482))<br />
<br />
DW frost CAN NOT dps in blood presence. I say it again: The changes made to DW and 2h frost in MOP, IS STUPID!<br />
As I said, Frost can't sit in Blood Presence. Unholy can, and it's a concern for PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318894444336254976))<br />

any chance on removing some hunter ability bloat in 6.0?(maybe before?) seems too many buttons since MoP<br />
We tried to remove some before but still get &quot;Bring back Eyes of the Beast!&quot; requests. We'll try again. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318799259375910913))<br />
If you don't want to use EOTB you don't have to, but having readiness means the class has to use it for bestDPS<br />
Sure, but we could buff every shot to compensate and call it a day. Hunters have plenty of ways to demonstrate skill these days. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318892952564944896))<br />
We think the core rotation buttons are fine. There are a LOT of situational hunter buttons though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318799369568665600))<br />
when I complain about bloat, I mean abilities that are part of my dps rotation, like Glaive, DireBeast, Crows, Stampede.<br />
You have a passive option to Dire Beast. We could add one to the Crows row. Rapid Fire and Readiness could probably be pruned. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318819750018953216))<br />
any change you make, you'll have a portion of the hunter base complaining, I wouldn't want to be on you shoes. <br />
Yup. All the hunters happy with the number of buttons (or specific ones) won't say much until they are gone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318892284944973824))<br />

If mass dispel's defensive utility is too powerful, then increase the mana cost significantly.<br />
We considered that, but if you make it expensive enough to really hurt, it does affect Shadow utility in PvE. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319169618763739136))<br />
<br />
Old Mass Dispel glyph (cast time) is baked in for Holy and Disc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318893587871985666))<br />
Way overnerfing shadow. You said yourself that you didn't want to weaken shadow's raid utility.<br />
We tried not to. Glyph of Mass Dispel isn't super popular with Shadow PvE and you rarely need to Void Shift on short cooldowns. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318897785770479616))<br />
Raid utility? Mass dispel nerf is slap on the face for ARENA utility. Something you didn't want to touch.<br />
Shadow has plenty of PvP utility and really high damage to boot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319169307751874561))<br />
<br />
How about you give Shadows a replacement spell instead of Voidshift? It's hardly worth the level 87 slot.<br />
Shadow can still use VS for occasional PvE utility. It was causing problems in PvP giving the rest of the Shadow arsenal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318889517832613889))<br />
<br />
whats the reasoning for doubling the cool down practically on Shadow Void Shift? It's now just a worse vers of LoH but same CD<br />
We have to balance around the whole package, not individual spells. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318888997453701121))<br />
<br />
I've played disc forever and I do not spam one spell. I utilize just about all of my spells.<br />
Good priests do. The concern is more that bad priests can still be pretty effective with a lot less effort. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318898705438756864))<br />
<br />
Is atonement really that OP?<br />
Yes. It should trade off healing for some DPS. Didn't feel like it was much of a healing loss. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318896408025522176))<br />

Does Glyph of Unleashed Lightning being changed mean LB can be cast on the move baseline now?<br />
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318887228728279040))<br />
Will it be castable on the move for other specs too?<br />
Not sure yet. Might be okay, but Resto for one doesn't need any kind of PvP buff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318898434499301376))<br />
<br />
The game needs less cast while moving.. atleast for pvp.<br />
Agreed in general, but it's a benefit Elemental already had and doesn't seem like a big balance risk. It's also not instant. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318894209195180034))<br />
<br />
Old Unleashed Lightning glyph benefit is baked in for Elemental. Cast time penalty just goes away. (Anything can change before 5.3 launch.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318894055281020929))<br />
So buff for Ele which is doing pretty well and an extra glyph Enhance has to try to make room for when already bloated?<br />
Giving you a potentially useful glyph is a nerf? Is removing a useful glyph a buff? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318898068047147008))<br />

I'm still wondering why the heck you changed the Rage system for Warriors. I preferred Cata Style.<br />
For the most part, the Cata style was that rage didn't matter and you just hit buttons as fast as you could. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318810790348070913))<br />
I like the new rage system, but HS/Slam don't feel as integral to dumping rage as before for Arms.<br />
If rage isn't unbounded, then there will be less HS use almost by definition. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318814469222457344))<br />

As an important next step in its ongoing efforts to provide world-class entertainment, Blizzard has purchased IGN Pro League technology and assets from IGN. Along with this purchase, Blizzard is bringing onboard members of the IPL staff as the foundation for a new team based in San Francisco whose primary focus will be on creating high-quality web and mobile content in support of Blizzard games, while some IPL staff have joined Blizzard's existing eSports team.<br />
<br />
â€œThis new team will help us to further develop the rich media experiences that extend the fun and engagement of our games online,â€ said Itzik Ben-Bassat, Blizzardâ€™s executive vice president of publishing. â€œThis is a team of passionate gamers with a proven track record, and weâ€™re looking forward to now leveraging their expertise and technology to support a variety of online efforts.â€<br />
<br />
Regarding the transaction, Peer Schneider, executive vice president of IGN, stated, â€œWith the continuing evolution of the eSports space and the renewed focus on our core media brand, we made the decision to sell the IGN Pro League technology and assets and become agnostic in our competitive gaming coverage. Following Blizzardâ€™s acquisition of IPL assets, IGN will partner with multiple organizations and cover their events.â€<br />

You mean like how ensidia killed lk first? The only difference between the 2 is I dont think these people are going to be punished, as they didnt intentionally do it. But the point stands, bugged encounter is bugged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently * ç…Œ switched to 10 man after downing Lei Shen in 25 and that made all of Ra-Den's abilities work as it if were 10 man (except they had 25 people there fighting him) [...] The guild supposedly reported the issue to Blizzard so there isn't any actual exploiting going on, just a bug due to the different way in which 10s and 25s are handled in Asia (different lockout etc).&quot;<br />

A kill is a kill no matter how it's done especially when other guilds are currently fighting the same bugged encounter. It is a legit world first congrats to them.<br />
<br />
Seriously? They killed it with a bug that allowed them to kill it on 10m using 25 people. So no it doesn't count and you should learn what the bug is before posting dumb statements like that. And Asia and US/EU are not even in the same race. 10m and 25m do not share lockouts in Asia and they can farm both, with 10m being significantly easier and 25m dropping higher level gear than available in US/EU.</div></div><hr />

Hunters - &quot;We didnt use that except when we were bored or to cheese an achievement.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would like to know what they mean by &quot;pruning&quot; readiness and rapid fire. Anything more than limiting it to the MM tree will really piss me off. Those are 2 of the best abilities we have, especially readiness which lets me use whatever I want twice in a row(except stampede). IMO get rid of stampede, make a petless option in the MoC tier(passive, no extra buttons), bake widow venom into serpent sting. Look I got rid of 3 extra buttons that will actually affect how many we use in a normal situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did the encounter in 10 man with 25 players, after submitting a bug report to Blizzard on it. They knew it was flawed and expect it not to count for them and for Blizzard to take away everything afterwards. They also noticed a big flaw while they where doing the raid, which could be some sort of bug seeing as the encounter is untested.<br />
<br />
They also only survived with 3 players at the end.</div></div><hr />

It's not sad if they did it after reporting it to Blizzard. They knew right after they killed it everything would be stripped from them, and that's what they wanted to happen.<br />
<br />
I also expect Blizzard got some valuable data from it to improve upon the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yuck. No offence but I hate your ideas on Hunters.<br />
<br />
Readiness and Rapid Fire are just pretty bland DPS CDs so that's likely why they'd be the targets of pruning. Rapid Fire is also redundant for BM since it has Focus Fire as part of its rotation. Hunters have buttloads of buttons, I'd welcome mine getting her bars cleaned up a bit.<br />

P.S. Add back Eyes of the Beast as a glyph!</div></div><hr />

Even though they planned to wipe... normally you wouldn't burn an attempt &quot;just for fun&quot;. I'm thinking they planned to exploit this bug to learn more about the encounter (as very little is known, and most is kept private). So, I wouldn't put the possibility of a temporary ban out of the picture. On the other hand, this isn't Europe/US, and I think they let the local team there make the major decisions.<br />
<br />
Oh well I guess the &quot;surprise&quot; of when to do your final desperate burn phase is more clear.</div></div><hr />

thats the biggest load of bs, they said that the kill wasent intended, they wanted to find out more about the mechanics in the end, they didnt know that he would go friendly at 5.5%, and they said the exact same to blizz, if you want to read more read the post at manaflask<br />

I don't think they did it nefariously. They reported it afterward and were very up front that it was bugged. It sounded lik they knew it wouldn't count but wanted to test it just the same.<br />
<br />
This is different from past ban exploits where people did very clever, but clearly sketchy, things to win. Or feigned innocent about not noticing a bug that should have been very obvious to players as well-trained as them.<br />
<br />
I mean, maybe they'll be banned, but I doubt it. The circumstances on this one seem more helpful to Blizzard in terms of uncovering and reporting the bug then cheating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Asia's guilds are already considered to be on a separate racecourse, so to speak, to the EU and NA guilds we habitually report on, thanks to their increased item levels and higher HP bosses, but this is far beyond that. Manaflask reports the following:<br />

<br />
The guild have, as mentioned above, reported this to Blizzard, and are convinced that, given all the aforementioned, their kill shouldn't be considered valid.

<br />
The thing is this, that we encounter in the wasteland 25H Leiden process skills mechanisms are not consistent with common sense (perhaps at this stage Leyden did not design perfect), then try to continue in this way, it hit more low blood stage access to information<br />
<br />
Results, 5.5% of the time BOSS becomes friendly unit and out of Shuabing achievements, we are convinced that this is not the Leiden &quot;correct&quot; kill related issues have also been submitted to the Netease official, hoping to get attention.<br />

Next week we will continue to Leiden wasteland attempt until the correct method to kill so far!<br />

It's not as if shamans were taking away the staff from the more deserving (?) caster classes, as raid finder loot doesn't work like that.

The thing is this, that we encounter in the wasteland 25H Leiden process skills mechanisms are not consistent with common sense (perhaps at this stage Leyden did not design perfect), then try to continue in this way, it hit more low blood stage access to information<br />
<br />
Results, 5.5% of the time BOSS becomes friendly unit and out of Shuabing achievements, we are convinced that this is not the Leiden &quot;correct&quot; kill related issues have also been submitted to the Netease official, hoping to get attention.<br />
<br />
Next week we will continue to Leiden wasteland attempt until the correct method to kill so far!<br />
<br />

<br />
Well.....if Blizz still has some balls left, they will call this kill invalid.<br />
It was a &quot;perfect&quot; exploit......switching from 25 to 10 seeing it &quot;works&quot; somehow and going to &quot;try&quot; a boss. Thats bullshit. Let a EU/US guild do this and a few &quot;moments&quot; later you would read an offizial blue-post like &quot;Guild xy did intential bug using. Well they reported it, but f*ck it, we are Blizz and call the kill invalid and ban the whole raid for x days&quot;</div></div><hr />

Those were all bad rumors and u can just judge it yourself: Is it possible that a dungeon is bugged when u switch from 25m to 10m and there is no other problem except before Ra'den? How could it happen?<br />
<br />
Of course after there guild made the declaration, a reasonable explanation is that they kite the mogu energy to prevent Ra'den to absorb them and gain power, which is OBVIOUSLY not Blizzard's intention. This is a failure in instance-design but not a fault to player that detected it especially those who did not decide to kill the boss with it. No one knows that Ra'den will fall at 5.5%, also no one knows if the boss will enrage and instantly kill the team at like 10min. They are just experimenting. You can cancel there first-down achieve; you can ignore them as world first kill (in fact they also admitted it not count as world first kill, and will try more times in the following weeks); however you should not put all the crime on them, espeially frame a case against them.<br />
<br />
As to the loot, one saying is that they knew that a bugged kill didn't count so they had not loot the boss, and even they loot the boss it is quite possible that the system will remove them. In the screenshot we can see that the treasure box is just behind them, and the only gear they get is from a mogu fortunate coin.</div></div><hr />

However, local team can't do much on this as they usually report to Blizzard and wait for decision, don't know how it will turn out but the data shall will valuable for all to try the boss.<br />
<br />
Can't blame blizzard fully for this, intentionally testers are restricted by what they known, and beta-testers are not there for testing, More important it how they react, some MMOs even fix bugs when all players used for years in the old day...</div></div><hr />

Who made you the fact checker? Whoever did should get fired. If you never saw the hype for GW2 (b4 it came out obviously) it was suppose to kill wow. If you didn't see the rants about it then you either live in denial or you simply didn't visit any mmo forum or youtube for half a year. Also it is free to play. Do you mean pay to win perhaps? Either way your trying to contort the truth the simple fact is that its a game that you pay to own and then don't pay monthly for. Which is commonly known as free to play.<br />

It doesn't really work the same for Europe and Asia actually. On Asian servers, 10 and 25 man have seperate lockouts, 25 drops better gear, and 10 is significantly easier, some bosses even have less abilities. This article doesn't seem to mention that the bug was only possible because of the lockouts - they somehow switched to 10 man while keeping 25 people in the group. Killing it within hours of the Asia first Lei Shen kill should be enough proof of *something* being wrong. EU/US guilds, who were good enough to kill Lei Shen 2/3 weeks earlier didn't kill Ra-den in those 2/3 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not as if shamans were taking away the staff from the more deserving (?) caster classes, as raid finder loot doesn't work like that. While MH/OH is better when an enchant is factored in, this would be like excluding 1H strength weapons from DKs because currently 2H frost performs better.<br />

<br />
No it is sad. They exploited a bug to kill it. When Paragon almost 1 shot Sinistra after their DK stole her ability and used it back on her they waited for blizzard to fix it. This guild knew something was wrong and went with it anyways.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, it's because the Chinese region uses different lockout mechanics and those mechanics didn't properly interact with the Ra-den fight. It wasn't an intentional exploit and the guild reported the bug when it happened. It's not as if they were trying to seek world first glory for it.<br />
<br />
Most people don't treat the race the same between the West and East as the same race anyway, because the Chinese version also has differences in ilevel and boss health, to cater to the nuances of Chinese playstyles.</div></div><hr />

Disagree here. My guild does this quite a bit actually. There are many times where we pull a boss just for the sake of testing someone's idea. We've also pulled bosses with 8-9 (and in the past 20-24) people just to see if we could kill it.</div></div><hr />

Actually the definition of F2P is pretty clear : FREE TO PLAY aka you don't HAVE to pay to play that kind of games, but you can if you want (better weapon, more XP, new heroes, more slots, whatever)<br />
<br />
100% of GW2 players have paid to play it, thus making it clearly a non F2P game (it is often called B2P, buy to play, for online games who just require the initial price, like classic offline games).</div></div><hr />

You are talking about bosses that do not have a limit on the number of attempts you can make. Ra-den has a limit on the amount of attempts (30) you can make each week.</div></div><hr />

Shadowburn requires a burning ember, not mana. Which is quite an issue as well. Other points still stand though. On the other hand, I'm not sure that comparing executes has a lot of meaning for PvP.</div></div><hr />

Wondering the same. Got mine on the first week it was available in LFR, and on a bonus roll must I add.<br />
<br />
It seems the bonus roll won't award it even in normal (or heroic), even though we can equip this weapon, which means elem/resto are strictly limited to the fist weapon on council or Durumu's dagger when it comes to bonus rolls or Jerthud's rare drop for the first 7-8 encounters (in normal).</div></div><hr />

The point is :<br />
1. It is world first kill, since its the first in the world (granted, world first doesnt really mean anything nowadays with the mixing of EU / Asia + 10 and 25, which are all different games)<br />
2. No one should give a damn what Ion Krisofnsdikjbfnisjkoss says (regarding removing them the kill) if he can't design an encounter correctly.<br />
3. The encounter was released on live, therefore Blizz was happy with its testing (internally), therefore it is part of the race, and the first guild to kill it gets world first (or Asia first 25).<br />
4. If Blizzard / Ion Krisfjnidrejtnnjosss messed up the encounter, it is down to them, and the first guild to kill it should not loose their title / prestige / whatever. <br />

Probably because a lot of people still don't know it works differently in Asia. Notice they are saying things like, &quot;NA/US had the same bugs&quot;. Do they know that? No they don't. There indeed could be a bug that resulted from their different lockout system.<br />
<br />
And by your definition Ensidia got World First Lich King kill. They bugged it, killed it and got suspended for it. Blizzard released it live with the bugs though. <br />
<br />
Blizzard rolled back the World First level 90 as well. The arena and rbg rating exploits from last season resulted in bans and ratings/achievements being taken away.

Wonder how u conclude that Asia 10m is easier. The fact is, Asia 10m is definitely at the same level of difficulty as US and EU, and their 25m bosses have 10% more damage and health than US and EU's 25m. Although they have better gear, the battle difficulty for them is quite harder than US and EU. I think the only benefit for them is the double lockout, which may prove to be useless during the progression at the beginning at 5.2, because most guild have more than one team to harvest their gear for best raiders during progression.<br />
<br />
Asia guild dose not have world best ilvl team, and the time for Chinese guild to compete first kill is one week less than US and EU. So it's not easy for them to even kill heroic Lei Shen in the same week as US and EU.<br />

It's not a bug related to lockout. It's a bug about the mechanism of the fight. BLZ just fixed it worldwide. U can see it in last hotfix notes.<br />
Again they were not using 25 man to defeat a 10m boss. It's totally made up.</div></div><hr />

It's not a bug related to lockout. It's a bug about the mechanism of the fight. BLZ just fixed it worldwide. U can see it in last hotfix notes.<br />
Again they were not using 25 man to defeat a 10m boss. It's totally made up.<br />
<br />
Why do you continue to try and legitimize this, at best they were the first to find a bug in the encounter and took advantage of it, but probably because it was from China and to be politically correct they will not suspend them.<br />
<br />
Sure they &quot;beat&quot; the fight, but not in how the encounter was intended so until someone defeats the encounter as it was intended there is no world first. <br />
<br />
Just for the very fact that 25 man drops higher item level gear and they have SEPERATE lockouts in China is more than enough reason for me to give any defeat an asterisk beside their name.</div></div><hr />

They'll probably get everything taken away from them. Honestly has to suck too for them because they probably REALLY want to kill it.<br />
<br />
As everyone has stated though, since they have higher 25man ilvl and double lockouts, they're going to be world first in these kinds of kills. They just have too much of an advantage in this specific instance.</div></div><hr />

Because LFR was dropping the heroic version. Lucky bastards who managed to get one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They say the lfr version is no longer obtainable in loot rolls for Elemental/Resto Shaman because the heroic version was dropping? Makes complete sense, not. Why would they not just hotfix the Heroic being obtainable on LFR instead of eliminating Elemental and Resto shaman being able to obtain an item they could actually use? Going to have to say that is probably not the reason.<br />
<br />

Wonder how u conclude that Asia 10m is easier. The fact is, Asia 10m is definitely at the same level of difficulty as US and EU, and their 25m bosses have 10% more damage and health than US and EU's 25m. Although they have better gear, the battle difficulty for them is quite harder than US and EU. I think the only benefit for them is the double lockout, which may prove to be useless during the progression at the beginning at 5.2, because most guild have more than one team to harvest their gear for best raiders during progression.<br />
<br />
Umm seriously? Its not hard to figure out how it is easier. They can get 25m loot and do 10m. They can farm gear from both lockouts. That is more chances at tier set bonuses and higher level gear to trivialize the encounters in general. Try using some common sense. It is a different game for them, so no they will never be able to compete with US/EU.</div></div><hr />

U neglected their 25m bosses are 10% higher in health and damage. Even with 8 ilvl higher it's still relatively harder for an Asia team to kill their 25m boss. U remember Sha of Fear? I watched their report and their 25m bosses' level of difficulty are totally changed after their lockout seperated, which in Blizzard's words:&quot;We think Asia players like things that with more challenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
And yeah they can harvest gear from both lockout. But this is progression. Despite that under high pressure did they turly have time to harvest gear in 2 lockouts. US and EU guilds have already fought in ToT heroic mode for 4 weeks, while Chinese guilds only have 3 weeks. U can see in the armory or their progress website that their average ilvl are not as high as Method or BL, and they need to defeat a 10% stronger bosses under this situation, and Ra'den is a 25m kill.<br />

I'm not trying to legitimize this, and it's not right even in China(which their guild also admited). Moreover, Chinese Battle.net had also given out offical declaration to figure out that it's not corret. What made u think about politics? China is not North Korea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But what is about all the Primordius HC Kills with 25% less damage taken instead of 75%?<br />
<br />
My Opinion is that the Ra-Den kill, even if they had used a bug, was an World First and its a Legit kill - it will be much harder for all those guilds to kill it in future, the same is for Primordius HC...</div></div><hr />

I neglected nothing. You asked how is their 10m easier. And I told you exactly how their 10m is easier. They have access to higher level loot to come in and trivialize the encounters. For US/EU, 10 and 25m is supposed to be relatively the same difficulty. In Asia they are not. 10m is supposed to be easier since it is tooned for a lower ilvl. So they can go farm 25m gear and then do 10m in that gear. Basically progress in 10m already having gear that is the equivalent of 10m heroic. So you think that 10m Asia should be considered at the same progression as US/EU when they have access to higher ilvl gear to make the encounters much easier? You seem to think 10m is at 10% increased difficulty. It isn't. 10m gear there is the same ilvl we have access to, so it is set to the same difficulty of our 10m, but we don't have access to the higher ilvl gear that they can get in 25m. They can just farm 25m normal and then use that gear to faceroll heroic 10m. Btw the ilvl increase and the rate of gear is more than enough to overtake a 8% difficulty increase(when did it become 10% over 8% that the blues posted?) on 25m as well. EU/US and Asia are two different games now and should never ever be counted together.<br />
<br />
And as for these guilds having a lower average ilvl as Method and Blood Legion. Wowprogress's ilvl progression shows you otherwise. They have 11 guilds with a higher ilvl than blood legion who is #1 in ilvl for EU/US. China had H ToT for 3 weeks but they got 6 lockouts vs 4, you do the math.</div></div><hr />

I'm hardly the type to get all worked up over this, common sense will always prevail and if folks like night want to try and hide the common sense, so be but its still there.<br />
<br />
Great post btw.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mic_128</div><div class="date">2013-04-11, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They also started giving them double lockouts to catch up.<br />
<br />
Actually it was because the Chinese community was really really vocal against shared lockouts.<br />
<br />
<br />

Why would they not just hotfix the Heroic being obtainable on LFR instead of eliminating Elemental and Resto shaman being able to obtain an item they could actually use?

Good news, latest patch has reversed the change.</div></div><hr />
