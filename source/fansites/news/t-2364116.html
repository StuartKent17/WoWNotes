Patrick &quot;Vanion&quot; Michalczak Passes Away<br />
Patrick Michalczak ran the German WoW fansite Vanion.EU (http://www.vanion.eu/) and passed away on January 2. It was always a pleasure to work with him and he will be missed.<br />
Sadly I have to tell you that Patrick &quot;Vanion&quot; Michalczak passed away on Tuesday, January 2, 2018. With this article I once again direct my heartfelt condolences to his family. I am sure that, as members of this community, you guys are as shocked as I am and every other person that has been in contact with Patrick. A lot of questions have followed after the shock. I ask that you give the family time to mourn and stray away from any sort of speculation. Vanion was a well known person and it would be sad if rumors and false news were spread.<br />
<br />
Patrick was not only a loved member of the German WoW Community, but also a loved brother, son and friend. I personally can't and won't share further details about this tragic event. Privacy has clear priority in such a matter and I only wrote this article because there was already speculation in the German community and I did not want it to spread further. Please be considerate of the mourning family members and friends. We will talk about the topic in more detail when the time is right.<br />
<br />
The work on Vanion.eu will continue just like it has been the past few days. It is also too early to talk about the future of this site, but you will hear from us in the coming weeks. I wish the best for all community members that have to stomach this sudden announcement and suggest lighting a small candle, even just a tea light, in honor of Patrick &quot;Vanion&quot; Michaelczak today. That would be a lovely gesture.<br />

<br />
Or pre-order. Old zone level scaleing and new races both being in the same patch, gives it a good chance that pre-orders will start soon after which gives people that buy BfA something to do (level/gear new characters) while they wait for release.</div></div><hr />

The allied races are coming in 7.3.5 but not right away, similar to how DHs came, mate. It will be a pre-purchase thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Dark Iron Dwarves and the Zandalari are the 'BFA' races in that we'll have to do BFA content in order to unlock them. It's not too surprising we haven't received a lot of information about then, and makes it all the more likely that the other four are in fact being released sooner rather than later.<br />
<br />
That said, I feel like they should increase rep gains for the Army and Reach by quite a bit. Make it so that the Argus campaign takes you all the way to revered at least, and have the WQ's that award rep tokens active more frequently. I play Horde myself but right now it doesn't exactly seem fair that Alliance players will have to farm for 1/2 months to get their reputations to exalted, when the Horde races can be unlocked within a week.</div></div><hr />

Then why add them in 7.3.5? Pandaren weren't added in the final Cataclysm patch, the new character models weren't added in the final Pandaria patch, DH's weren't added in the final WoD patch... it has always been the x.0.1/x.0.3 updates :D</div></div><hr />

I don't recall Blizzard stating as such.<br />
<br />
What I do know is 7.3.5's UI has code in there that checks if <br />
<br />
(a) You have the achievement needed<br />
(b) That hasExpansion is true - this variable could either be if your expansion level is BfA or if you've pre purchased (the code isn't clear on that)<br />
<br />
Before it allows you to create an Allied Race.<br />
<br />
The code's probably going to be dormant in 7.3.5 but further discussion on if Allied Races are coming to 7.3.5 is moot - Blizzard isn't going to drop 7.3.5 then at the same time release the expansion LOL<br />

If that's true then it would be looking for BfA, what sense would there be if it were looking for Legion even though you need Legion to have reached the Achieves and rep. Unless it was added as a red herring, to surprise us that they are coming this patch, but that seems unlikely.<br />

Not sure you've convinced me on that last part. Redone leveling experience for low levels in old content is coming with the next patch. Why on earth would they release the first 4ish new allied races at the start of BfA, when people are least inclined to level new characters, instead of the patch that's revamping the leveling process? :confused:</div></div><hr />

Assuming they used the same method for this as the HS trailers and their motion stories (Lords of War, etc.), they actually cut out elements of the illustration and import them into the usual software they use for their fully CG cinematics. They just layer and manipulate those 2D elements in a 3D space instead of making fully 3D models -- they basically turn them into a sort of matte painting diorama, in other words.<br />
<br />
I think they did a behind the scenes video, but I can't recall if it was on the official YouTube or one of the CE DVDs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not surprised. Imagine if they created their own unique, long and interesting questline instead. Wow. Wouldn't that be something instead of being l a z y.<br />
<br />
I don't get it either.<br />
<br />
It was so easy to just phase a few areas with a small questline up to level 20. Those areas exist !<br />
Nightborne could've started in Suramar city. Questline would've been them living under Legion's hand, then witnessing the Horde/Alliance rushing the Legion in Suramar City, then joining the rebellion etc (and the Horde at level 20).<br />
Same for Taurens with Highmountain, Void elves in Mac'Aree, Lightforged Draenei wherever in Argus<br />
<br />
That looks cheap.</div></div><hr />

Both in technological behind the scenes patching work as well as plotting and story details.<br />
<br />
It's possible we'll see Allied Race NPCs coming in to build the story elements and establish a plot arc.<br />
<br />
But actually create Allied Race Characters.<br />
<br />
LOL Nope.<br />
<br />
When have Blizz ever done expansion groundwork before the actual expansion prepatch? I know it might be different this time, but the chances seem pretty low to me. Why change it? You don't need to add allied races to conclude the story in Legion</div></div><hr />

German news sites are saying it's a suspected accidental overdose but cannot rule out suicide due to &quot;current events&quot; that they don't wish to release to the public yet.<br />

Yeah but it says you need to have a 110 on that server, which is why I'm wondering. All my 110s are one realm, all horde, where as my alliance are on the connected realm and aren't 110 yet.</div></div><hr />

You can preorder digitally and order the physical CE as well. When the physical CE arrives, and you put in the key on your account, they will refund you the digital pre-order price. At least they have been last couple of expacs.</div></div><hr />

I think at one point in the past, you could contact customer service and get a refund or at least credit towards your monthly subscription but Boern is correct for how they currently handle things. its better than a poke in the eye, but it means that you have to spend more than twice as much to get your early unlock and the person who gets your refunded code doesnt get access to the bonuses. So one way other the other, someone is getting shafted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're a lot less interested in buying the expansion here, as rolling a new character as one of the affected races was one of the big appeals of the expansion.<br />
<br />
You can say &quot;filthy casuals, play the game!&quot; or whatever, but from a marketing point of view this just seems like a dumb move on Blizzard's part.</div></div><hr />
