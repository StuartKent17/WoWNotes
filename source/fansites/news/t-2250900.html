Patch 7.3 - Feral Druid Changes<br />
Hi Cats,<br />
<br />
We have a number of changes to Feral Druids coming soon. The general goals of these changes are:<br />
<br />
1. Reduce (but not necessarily displace entirely) the dominance of the big three complexifying and powerful talents: Savage Roar, Jagged Wounds, and Bloodtalons. Each of those talents is (on live) winning by a large margin in terms of throughput against other talents on their rows.<br />
2. Balance out the power level of the last 3 talent rows, allowing more talents builds to be viable.<br />
3. Increase the skill floor and reduce how punishing it can be to error when playing the rotation.<br />
4. Compensate for power-level-reductions of talents with baseline damage increase to the spec so that at the highest level, performance isn’t really affected, but the bottom of the spec is brought up.<br />
<br />
The most major changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
All damage done increased by 33%.<br />
Jagged Wounds (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/202032) reduced to 20%. (down from 33%)<br />
Savage Roar (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/52610) duration increased by 50% at all combo points. Damage bonus reduced to 15%. (down from 25%)<br />
Bloodtalons (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/155672) damage bonus reduced to 25%. (down from 50%)<br />
<br />
Looking back at the development of Feral Druid in Legion: when Savage Roar was moved from a baseline ability to the talent tree, in order to bring the power level of the ability closer to most talents (+25% damage to everything for a long duration is far stronger than most talents are), rather than reducing its damage bonus, its duration was significantly shortened instead. This contributed greatly to the overconstrained and overly punishing Feral rotation that you see on live today. Additionally, Jagged Wounds was added as a new talent, reducing the amount of free combo points Ferals had available to finishers such as Ferocious Bite (which was basically pushed out of the rotation entirely). Both talents probably would have been fine on their own, but taken together (because they were the strongest) at the live tuning values led to a more pressured Feral rotation than we felt was right.<br />
<br />
Additionally, a few talents are being rearranged in the talent tree:<br />
<br />
<br />
Jagged Wounds (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/202032) moved to lvl 75 row. (from lvl 90 row)<br />
Savage Roar (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/52610) moved to lvl 90 row. (from lvl 75 row)<br />
Brutal Slash (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/202028) moved to lvl 90 row. (from lvl 100 row)<br />
Elune’s Guidance moved to lvl 100 row. (from lvl 90 row)<br />
<br />
<br />
The primary gain here is moving Brutal Slash to a sort of multitarget/AOE lvl 90 talent row along with Sabertooth (which can be well-utilized in a sustained low-target situation), giving the lvl 90 row a solid talent for dungeons. For now, we want to go with an arrangement that keeps Jagged Wounds, Savage Roar, and Bloodtalons on separate rows so the current most common live build is still possible.<br />
<br />
Other less major changes include quality of life and tuning adjustments to some talents to balance out the rows:<br />
<br />
<br />
Prowl (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/102547) cooldown reduced to 6 sec (down from 10 sec) for all Druid specs.<br />
Rebirth (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20484) is castable in all forms, and consequently, is no longer affected by or consumes Predatory Swiftness.<br />
Sabertooth (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/202031) damage bonus to Ferocious Bite increased to 20%.<br />
Incarnation: King of the Jungle (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/102543) energy cost reduction reduced to 50% (down from 60%) and only allows the use of Prowl once. This it to balance out that talent row with the new Jagged Wounds and to reduce the frequency of Rake stuns in PvP while still allowing Incarnation to function as an effective Vanish.<br />
Moment of Clarity (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/155577) now causes Omen of Clarity to trigger twice as often and increases the damage of the affected abilities by 25%. This is to better space out what is essentially a large energy proc and reduce slightly the impact that a single talent has on the resource income and pacing of the rotation.<br />
Elune’s Guidance cooldown reduced to 30 sec (down from 45 sec) and combo points granted reduced to 5 + 5 over 5 seconds (down from 5 + 8 over 8 seconds).<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, with these changes, balance for the last 3 talent rows and consequently overall should be better in general. We expect the current most common build/playstyle of Jagged Wounds + Savage Roar + Bloodtalons to still remain one of the strongest builds, but it should no longer win by a huge margin over other competing talent builds and also should be a little less strenuous to play.<br />
<br />
These changes should be available in an upcoming PTR build. As usual, we may make further adjustments – especially tuning – as PTR progresses. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757496609?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
Feral Druid T21 Set Bonus<br />
The current intention of the Feral 4 piece bonus is that you get a 100% free in every way (except a GCD) Ferocious Bite. <br />
<br />
This may change as set bonuses go through some more iteration throughout the 7.3.0 development cycle.<br />
<br />

They aren't being buffed. Their rotation is being made easier because in order to play feral perfectly you need to pop an adderal and a couple of red bulls. In order to compensate for reducing the room for error the talents have been nerfed so a mistake isn't so punishing to your DPS. So their overall damage is buffed to bring them back up to normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That change alone in a vacuum would perhaps mean that. But you should really read the entire post in its entirety. The overall buff is to compensate for the damage reductions on the top talents - their goal is to keep high-end players on a similar damage level.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems to be more of a &quot;make spec more forgiving&quot; instead of a buff, so ferals will still be läßt. Maybe<br />
<br />
The average damage will still increase. If you're the best feral player in the world, perhaps it'll remain similar, but for everyone else it would increase - which would definitely be reflected in charts.</div></div><hr />

People massively overexaggerate how hard Feral is to play. It requires understanding of a few basic concepts, which are very different to most other classes(or at least more pronounced), after you get those basic concepts it's not hard to execute.</div></div><hr />

It is tedious and meticulous to play though.<br />

So much more micro managing then any other class I've played<br />

It's not difficult to hit buttons in the proper order to optimize DPS. It is however, extremely unforgiving for any mistakes that are made and the attention to detail required is unlike any other spec I've played.</div></div><hr />

You have to be joking. Like, you literally have to be. There's no way you can be serious. Feral is still almost the same spec it has been since at least Wrath of the Lich King(which imo is a good thing). Elemental got a full rework this expansion.</div></div><hr />

Adding an artifact ability and making some baseline spells into talents isnt exactly a rework.</div></div><hr />

You're forgetting about the new resource(or rather taking an existing mechanic and turning it into a more versatile resource). That alone is more &quot;rework&quot; than Feral has ever received. Totems got reworked as well.</div></div><hr />

Versatile resource, lol - Maelstrom for Elemental is an Enhancement afterthought. It's not eben comparable how &quot;versatile&quot; it is for them. Totems got removed and not reworked, FYI. With the last change to Earthquake we don't cast it anymore - so it's basically back to pre Legion state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, notice how all of those things are changes. Feral is still basically the same spec as it was back in Wrath, with the only real differences being the addition of Bloodtalons(MoP), removal of stat snapshotting(everybody going into WoD) and then the addition of the artifact ability. Elemental has been changed more just in Legion.</div></div><hr />

See this is the problem. People may like to play a spec because of other reasons beyond gameplay; they may like the archetype, the aesthetics, the lore around it. Feral had a very complex rotation for middling returns but even worse, the complexity was entirely due to talents and the difference between picking the complex talents and the more passive talents was very significant. Honestly if the simpler rotation was not that far behind, it would have been fine imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is where I disagree. Gameplay should come first at all times, and if people don't like the gameplay, that should not be changed just because they like the idea of being a cat.</div></div><hr />

I played feral from BC through MOP. It was made far more complex in both MOP and then Legion. It's always been one of the most difficult specs to master but they took it to the next level in Legion if you wanted the most optimal talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baseline:<br />
<br />
- 5 combo points Savage Roar is 42 seconds like MoP/WoD<br />
- Savage Roar can be used with 0 combo points for a 12 second duration buff (like the MoP glyph, QoL change - can also do the WoD version where you are granted a full buff if using Rake from stealth)<br />
<br />
PvP talents:<br />
<br />
- Cyclone (Replace Enraged Maim or King of the Jungle)<br />
- Barkskin (Replacing Thorns, the talent should also remove 1x Survival Instincts charge)<br />
- A &quot;Druidism&quot; talent which would give the following spells: Mark of the Wild, Innervate, Hibernate, Tranquility, Soothe &amp; Nature's Grasp (replacing Ferocious Wound)</div></div><hr />

As a feral player for 10 years that just rerolled Frost Mage: Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
The feral rotation was absolutely ridiculous. You have 5 different abilities that snapshot your bleeds. One is a short term cooldown, 2 are medium term cooldowns, 1 is a very long cooldown, and the last one becomes available as a proc, which you must wait until 4 combo points to use. You must get to 4 combo points soon or the proc is lost, which can actually fail because the energy regeneration is so low. On top of that, there's 3 bleeds that needs to be kept up at all times, and every single one of them can snapshot with all of the above, and one of those abilities is a finishers, and one of them is applied whenever you get a Clearcasting proc. Any attempt to deviate from the most punishing spec nerfed your DPS by approximately 25%.<br />
<br />
Overall, the core rotation consists of 13 buttons. On top of that, energy and combo point management is very tight, and any failure to look ahead ~10 seconds will result in a colossal (about 35%) DPS loss.<br />
<br />
While I do like a hard rotation, this thing was completely crazy, and I'm glad Blizzard took a look at it.<br />
<br />

&quot;I've played Druids for years&quot; Not from Wrath then, because it is essentially how it was back in wrath in terms of the short duration timers, and these have been the most fun times for the spec. Just because *you* cannot play it properly doesn't mean it is bad.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes sorry, the devs who never make a single mistake (except almost every change they ever made, just like when they made DK easymode by removing multiple diseases) - The devs are doing this to help the LFR generation, people who can't even manage a single buff and single debuff. If I wanted to play Wotlk-era Ret paladin where I can just macro all my abilities into one button, I'd play an easy spec.</div></div><hr />

People will still pick BT and JW as they are so much better than the other alternatives. The only decision left now is BS or SR and I imagine most people will take SR still.<br />
<br />
The SR duration increase and JW being 80% instead of 66% is nice as it means we're refreshing SR 33% less and refreshing dots 17% less. which should allow for a smoother rotation with more FB.<br />
<br />
I don't think the 33% is enough though - will depend on how much more shred damage and FB damage you get in. Rough napkin math on our dots.<br />
<br />
(Base Damage * patch modifier) * JW * SR * BT = Bleed Damage<br />
7.2.5 = (100 * 1) * (1/0.66) * 1.25 * 1.5 = 284<br />
7.3 = (100 * 1.33) * (1/0.8) * 1.15 * 1.25 = 239<br />
<br />
239/284 = 0.84<br />
<br />
Therefor our bleeds will deal 16% less damage. So you'd need the 1.33 x all other damage to be more than 16% to keep our damage neutral.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always topped metters with my druid, I'm not the best player in the world at all, but I know my spec very very well. Yes, like others has pointed, the spec is not that hard to play once you've interiorized and muscle trained the full rotation, but even then, the failure punishing is wayyy to high compared to other specs, and this causes that feral suffers a lot in both competitive PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
And yes, one of the things I liked back then was the complexity of the spec, but even then you could stare to what was going on. Right now, with the SR+JW+BT talents you just simply cannot move your eyes from your actionbar/weakauras/or whatever addons you use to track the 1097823974234 things a feral must track to dps properly. It gets even worse if you play with Ailuro Pouncers, like I do.<br />
<br />
As much as I like a well designed rotation with some level of complexity, the current feral optimal spec it's overwhelmingly tight and prone to failure, not only by the player's mistakes, but also because of mechanics of bosses and other players in pvp. Stunned? Big damage lose. Target switching? Big damage lose. Has to stop dps for whatever reason (phase change, cc...), mob dies faster than expected? big damage lose... and all of these situationes fuck up your rotation... Finally you get your 4 pieces bonus from X tier? Your rotation becomes even more complex... and so on...<br />
<br />
Lately I've been running Incarnation, Sabretooth and Brutal Slash in pve... and I've been having a blast. My dps did drop, but I finally can watch the encounters, the textures of the zones, the spells, the... everything. And it's impossible to fail the rotation. I've also tried Soul of the Forest+Moment of Clarity and honestly, my energy never ever was a problem, but neither the direct damage nor bleeds are strong in this one, although the dps is very sustained, so I prefer the other talent combo. And I don't regret it.<br />
<br />
So yeah, excuse me if I say: go fuck yourself Savage Roar, finally</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreyen</div><div class="date">2017-07-08, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, so it's not for everybody, which is fine.<br />
<br />
I don't agree. Making a spec overly punishing compared to everything else is just bad design. However, it is fine if you can choose certain talents that are more punishing for some increase... but right now you have to choose all the complex talents to be decent, which is what they did to fix it.<br />
<br />
IMO I've loved feral back in wrath when it was the hardest class, but they were just making it less and less accessible for new ferals. Last time i tried playing feral again, i was definitely rusty, but i felt like i had to devote 100% of my time on the rotation rather than the actual game.</div></div><hr />

I'm really bad at Feral but usually I could at least out DPS the tanks and the lower DPS'ers of my guild. In Legion? Not really.. The rotation is ok but the things you have to line up in order to maximize DPS is stupid. The spec feels extremely unrewarding to play and luckily, my raidleader is aware of that.

The fact that it must be really well played to be as efficient as other classes push me to tryhard, and so keeping the same dps, or even a slightly better one than my guild mates. When playing it a lot it gets easy to do a good rotation against a dummy, but on any target that you can't hit 100% of the time, the fight is totally different.<br />

I hope the build with the 3 talents (SR, JW and BT) will still be the strongest build and the hardest to play, and they'll just make not predictable errors (such as phase changing or target switching) less painful.</div></div><hr />

they only have to do one thing: if you play your rotation perfectly, then you should be top tier. Thats how feral should work. the fun of the specc comes from the dps reward. <br />
<br />
The easy talents you can pick to sit on 100% energie all the time are too much and rekt yourself, that shouldn't be possible. <br />

otherwise a complete make-over for the class will be fine, something like more roars and keeping them up for situational skillbuffs for burst, dots , moving, aoe etc...<br />

The way feral is now is good, however the stat priority is all over the place and to get to top 5 in raid is quite hard. The changes were needed from the beginning of expansion, blizz knows the problem for months if not years. It felt nice in WoD but it made me feel sad playing feral as it was after maining it for over 9 years... Legion feral requires a lot of focus and planning. <br />
<br />
All in all I am happy about the changes, it is time for it and maybe from 7.3 people will not just disregard me applying for m+ or raid because I am a feral ... it feels bad :(</div></div><hr />

If I wanted to play Wotlk-era Ret paladin where I can just macro all my abilities into one button, I'd play an easy spec.<br />
<br />
Did you ever stop to consider that nobody wants to develop things around people like you because you're goddamn cancer?</div></div><hr />

Feral is most definitely hard, though I suppose it depends on how you define 'hard'. In any case, the Feral rotation when simplified is not hard to understand, no: keep up bleeds, keep up Savage Roar, manage cooldowns. To minmax Feral however requires a lot of thought and attention. Snapshotting, pandemic, timers, pooling, energy costs - there is so much to pay attention to, perhaps more than any other spec besides maybe Survival Hunter.<br />
<br />
That's why they're making this change in the first place. There is a huge gap between the top Feral players and the average Feral players, because of how demanding and unforgiving the rotation is. They want to minimize this skill gap and introduce more choice into the talents.</div></div><hr />

absolute rubbish. I played feral in WotLK where it was considered (followed by afflic) the hardest spec. Period. Don't you remember the 'john fucking madden' feral rotation picture that circulated? Without an arms warr manglebot it was even worse.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it was considered hard by you, in your little fantasy world. No spec of rogue has ever been hard to play.<br />

Oh no Druids have 1/4 specs that isn't top 3 overall. Lets waste development time on them over classes that are lucky to have 1 viable spec.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's obsessions with instilling the illusion that Druids are &quot;hard to play&quot; spec just fuels Druid player egos (hint, they haven't been since late vanilla). Subtlety was always harder to play successfully than Feral anyway.<br />
<br />
Feral cats should be happy ability bloat got trimmed, not get pissy about their self-fabricated illusion.<br />
<br />
Do everyone a favor and go back to the warrior forums. Someone that is so close minded about specs he knows nothing about will only succeed in embarrassing themselves when they attempt to comment on a spec which they can't even begin to comprehend. As a feral / guardian since 2005, a majority of our spec nerfs came from illiterate, ignorant players like you who cried about ferals in pvp until they got their way. The game would be better off with less of you, have a good day.<br />
<br />
Inb4omgimawarrioriknoweverythang: no spec of rogue has ever been hard to play. Get off the podium, no one here wants to hear the bs you are attempting to spew, gjd.</div></div><hr />

Wow thanks for this &quot;John fucking Madden&quot;, I didn't know about this picture and it's awesome. :D<br />
<br />
Regarding the changes, as a casual feral, that seems interesting. Now that I'm not raiding anymore, I enjoy playing with sub-optimal talents on some toons if the gameplay suits me better, as long as it doesn't make me useless (that's still a MMORPG, my choices don't have to impact other players' experience). And that was completely impossible to do on the Feral, because suboptimal talents transforms your tiger into a clawless kitten. <br />
<br />
Looking forward to that.<br />
<br />
I've read all the posts in this topic and I'm astonished by the amount of people saying &quot;Buuh I was playing Feral because it was hard to play and it was highly rewarding bla bla bla&quot;... Did you read the blue thing above ? Those talents will stay there, you'll still deal more damage with your top-tier rotation than low-skilled scrubs, you'll still be able to trash-talk on the chan when you'll deal 0.2% above everyone else. The only difference will be that players with lower skill than you, or simply without the will to play with 47 WAs, won't be left too far behind. That is the same reason behind the change they made (after/during MoP) with nearly all DoT snapshotting. The difference between a perfect rotation and an erroneous rotation was way too high.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ontis</div><div class="date">2017-07-10, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seven years of mockery. And you still fail to do things right.<br />
Seriously. You made a spec with an overcomplicated but rewarding performance back in WotLK. Ever since then you've been trying to disgrace and neuter said spec. Have you no decency?<br />
How hard is it to comprehend a simple fact: if you're 'casualizing' ALL damage dealer classes' rotations to literally three core buttons (or even 2 for some of them) and making Cats even more complicated at the same time, You Are Doing It Wrong.<br />
The person who came up with the idea of &quot;Savage roar: duration reduced, cost increased&quot; must die.<br />
The person who still refuses to copy ability text from Stealth to Prowl and keeps trying to play around it must be deported back to Mexico.<br />
The person who reduced damage done by Cat's AOE abilities to zero (spamming singletarget Rakes is usually more rewarding than Thrash-Swiping packs) must die.<br />
The person who gave the spec with SINGLE TARGET DAMAGE ONLY an artifact ability that deals SINGLE TARGET DAMAGE ONLY must die.<br />
The person who designed Jagged Wounds must die.<br />
His teammate who didn't bother removing GCD off instacast heals must share the abovementioned fate.<br />
The person who designed Elune's Guidance must die. The corpse must be burned to ashes. The ashes must be dumped into a pool of H2SO4. His very existence must be denied and forgotten. Such sheer stupidity must not be allowed to leave ANY trace.<br />
<br />
Do it. And for the love of god, START PLAYING YOUR OWN GAME.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elif</div><div class="date">2017-07-10, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to be joking. Like, you literally have to be. There's no way you can be serious. Feral is still almost the same spec it has been since at least Wrath of the Lich King(which imo is a good thing). Elemental got a full rework this expansion.<br />
<br />
YOU have to be joking. Have you played feral at all the past few expansions? You know, how it was in Wrath where we could use Mangle once a minute to improve bleed damage, but then it changed to where we had to Mangle spam certain bosses that couldn't be attacked from behind by Shred? Shred now no longer requires you to be behind a Target and Mangle disappears. Do you not remember Savage roar being a base spell learned rather than a talent while Incarnation was preferred? Wasn't it just this expansion where they condensed nearly all of feral druid's main abilities into three so you don't need a separate bar of abilities for Prowl (e.g. Ravage is now Shred in Prowl)? Remember when you could use Ferocious Bite without having even the slightest concern your &quot;rotation&quot; would fall off timing (more so than in previous xpac at least)? Where the hell did my Symbiosis even go?! <br />
<br />
I also hope you're not playing the elitist game and claiming the feral rotation today isn't as punishing as players claim. I have been playing feral since BC so I was quick to pick up and balance all of the abilities including moonfire when it was still competitive, but the moment the boss does a massive AoE effect around himself or I have to switch to adds, it becomes &quot;punishing&quot; due to the amount of bleeds I have still ticking. I also am unfortunately out in the boonies and my internet is less than desirable. If I start the fight off with lag or hit large lag spikes midfight, then I am almost forced to start my rotation again from scratch (i.e. refresh SR, Rip, and Rake) before Shredding again.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the change; anything is welcome. We'll see where it goes from here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few things:<br />
<br />
1. Feral is not a class, it's a spec. Pay more attention before you start a incoherent rant.<br />
2. Feral is and has been the least touched spec in the game when it comes to long overdue needed changes.<br />
3. Please don't ever procreate. Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

It requires understanding of a few basic concepts, which are very different to most other classes(or at least more pronounced), after you get those basic concepts it's not hard to execute.<br />
<br />
<br />
EXACTLY!!!! Try an Orbweaver and you wont have a problem with this class. All it needs is a small dps buff and to fix SR. SR should be castable with 0 CP like it used to be and that would fix some of the issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
People need instant gratification so they are dumbing it down enough for anybody to play and ruining it for those that like it.<br />
<br />
Incarn/SR/MoC is now the highest DPS numbers ive seen in some brief PTR testing. Um that is 40% or more of Shred usage. To me this is now a button mash with these changes.<br />

What does this even mean? I'm serious...what was going through your head when you typed this? Perhaps if you write in complete and coherent sentences I could reply.<br />

All of your posts are just total garbage and moaning about others moaning, which leads me to believe your old account was banned for abusive posts and this is your new one?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravingmad</div><div class="date">2017-07-17, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im very happy with the changes. The current best spec, SavageRoar+Jagged Claws+Bloodtalon is so tight to play and punishing. I've always respected Feral players because of the gameplay. I just leveled a Feral because of this change. I've always loved the spec, but I just couldnt play it to a HL level. Ferocious Bite will now be something to use somewhere else then during BloodLust or good Omen of Clarity procs, which is good and makes more sense.</div></div><hr />
