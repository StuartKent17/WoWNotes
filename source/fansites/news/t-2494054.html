Runelock Chest WQ Changes<br />
We’re adjusting the “Runelocked Chest” World Quests with a hotfix that changes the requirement from matching colors in a row to completing a specified total number of matches.<br />
<br />
I’m not sure how long this is going to take to change, but we’ll have it noted for you in our hotfixes list.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hotfixes: June 26, 2019<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
The total number of points required for a faction to win the Battle for Nazjatar War Mode event reduced to 3000 (was 10,000).<br />
<br />
Quests and World Quests<br />
<br />
Players will no longer need to relog to turn in the quest &quot;Saving Corin&quot;.<br />
Players can now turn in “Scouting the Pens” to Neri.<br />
<br />
World<br />
<br />
Players can no longer loiter at the teleport location for the Heart of Azeroth quest line in Highmountain.<br />
Cursed items found in Nazjatar will now take longer to affect your character, and the detrimental effects have been reduced.<br />
Fixed a bug where being mounted while interacting with Arcane Device would cause visual issues.<br />
Prince Wiggletail is now easier to defeat.<br />
Moved certain Chitterspine crabs in Bitterstone Cove that were out of line of sight behind the water wall.<br />
Duration of Glimmershell Fluid reduced to 2 minutes (was 30 seconds).<br />
Upon re-entering the zone, previously selected combat allies will once again join your side in Nazjatar.<br />
Weeping Sanya now spawns upstairs so she no longer interferes with the puzzle World Quest in the same building.<br />
Due to many harsh lessons learned from gravity, we are increasing the &quot;Slow Fall&quot; spell duration obtained from the top of Kal'methir Citadel from 15 seconds to 30.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most can see yellow, the problem is that green and orange can often be &quot;yellow&quot; to us too.<br />
<br />
i had to ask in chat, but i usually ask my kids shit like this. i was told the H looking one was yellow but fuck if i know if i was lied to. <br />
<br />
nobody gives a fuck about colorblind people, you fucks all color-code the world but god forbid someone say something that could be linked to anti-homosexuality in 50 moves or less<br />
<br />
it's time for a colorblind-pride parade and for us to fight for our rights. everyone else has done it. <br />
<br />
1) colorblind mode fucking sucks, it's just a shade changer and really isn't even good at that. <br />
<br />
2) no, colorblind glasses are a scam, they are also just shade changers<br />
<br />
3) a colorblind mode where the first letter of a color was in the corner of an icon's box would be great, and some games have it<br />
<br />
4) or just put the icon itself in the quest text, this is 2019, we can do that. give me the dev toolkit and i'll have it fixed in 5 mins<br />
<br />
5) they claim to be able to do surgery to fix colorblindness in monkeys. ok. maybe that's an option one day but what i've learned as &quot;yellow&quot; will be different and who knows if i can handle that change in my life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or Green or whatever color the quest asked you to match. The real issue is that Blizzard got it almost right. They made sure the game used symbols in addition to colors to differentiate the runes in the game. But then the quest tracker tells you a color and doesn't give an example of that specific color rune. <br />
<br />
I ran a screen shot through 8 different colorblind filters that I use for accessibility in my daily work as a UI/UX Developer/Designer and there is both a hue and brightness shift that makes every one look different enough. <br />
<br />
In the end someone missed the final detail of adding the rune to the quest tracker. Well that and that matching five of a specific rune can take some time if you are not an expert candy crush player. <br />

<br />
Jumping Jellies isn't actually hard if you figure out which jellies you should jump to. I tried so many tries with what seemed like the obvious jump order, but it was a trap.<br />
<br />
Basically, two simple hints:<br />
- At the start, do not jump to the &quot;center&quot; jelly, instead start with the one on the left.<br />
- When jumping towards the first big purple jelly, turn around in the air 180°, so that the purple one sends you back, and you should immediately get to the target.<br />
<br />
There is way more jellies then you'll ever need, no slow ascenscion towards the target, only like 4 hops or so.<br />
With these tips it took me only one more try to get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you spent 30 minutes doing one world quest, how was that not numb and stupid already? There's already enough to do in a day in Nazjatar, some people would rather spend 30 minutes of their time accomplishing more in the game than one single world quest, and that seems pretty reasonable. Besides you already have a Bejeweled toy in the game, if you want to challenge yourself. You don't need a world quests for that.</div></div><hr />

Wow, colorblind people can be UI designers? That would explain so many things... Do you have that job because you are colorblind or regardless of it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before sharding, this could be possible, as you could pick a pvp server with a healthy balance. <br />
<br />
And stop with the just turn wm off crap, when you lose 10-20% of rewards and all your pvp talents gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
There are different types of colorblindness.<br />
<br />
On my side (deuteranomaly), my green receptor is kinda fucked up, so a large amount of green shades just blend with the other colors. Basically, some greens and oranges are nearly the same to me, and unless it is really bright, the red can't be differentiated too. I am completely unable to differentiate violet from blue.<br />
<br />
But there are plenty of different color blindness (protanomaly/protanopy for Red, deuteranomaly/deuteranopia for Green, Tritanomaly/tritanopia for Blues, and monochromacy for complete color blindness so all grey) so of course they can't design a minigame around every one of them. But usually that is dealt with symbols or whatever.<br />
<br />
If a minigame only relies on colors, it's dead for us. :p<br />
The rune minigame seems to be acceptable for colorblind, as far as I can see. But we'll for sure have a lot more trouble than &quot;normal&quot; people. :p<br />
<br />
As an example, when I was told to pick the &quot;Red&quot; crystal on Mythic Eonar, I just had to identify in which corner it was always located. If blizzard had made that they all spawned randomly, you can be sure I'd never be assigned to this task, ever.</div></div><hr />

agree, i notice if you start the minigame then leave and jump in again. the game randomizes again. so techinally. you can keep doing that until you get a close to ideal setup.</div></div><hr />

Oh for the world quest it's too long.. yes, but it doesn't mean you need to take it out of the game. Could be some kind of weekly reward that you can do for rep or else.</div></div><hr />
