<br />
Your Alliance toon being exalted with Exodar doesn't transfer to a separate Horde toon being exalted with Silvermoon. Your alliance mage is not exalted with Silvermoon. You would have to faction change your Alliance Mage (who is exalted with Exodar) to Horde, and then your Exodar rep would convert to Silvermoon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah sorry my post was a little misleading, I didn't mean Silvermoon specifically, I meant the Alliance factions and if the actual char you want to get your heritage armor on has to be exalted with said faction, or if being exalted with said faction on another char is enough. Shaktard kinda answered my question though.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I think getting cloth and hair physics working would probably be one of the biggest visual improvements they could make to the game.<br />
<br />
Short of that, I don't think there's any way they could implement those styles of cloaks without causing massive clipping issues. I mean, the cloaks we have now already have tons of clipping issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
How can the specifically-made-for-bloodelves armor have the absolute worst clipping possible, specifically for every blood elf hairstyle?<br />
Either hide the helmet or pick a hairstyle that compliments it. Frankly there aren't enough facemask style helmets in the game and it's nice having helmets that still allow you to show your hair, which is a rarity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to be a douche but the Sunwell 70 armor looks much nicer than this.<br />
If you love being covered in giant pixels, maybe.<br />
<br />
At least this one has a lot of really nice pieces that you can swap around with other items to create a more approriate modern-looking blood elf transmog. And you can always rock a tabard instead of the chest. The Sunreaver Tabard should match it especially well.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dranlord</div><div class="date">2018-10-17, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the no hair physics and cliping issues will be something that we need to learn to deal with.<br />
<br />
To implement that on the current engine they need to redo how the engine work. Things like this show how old the engine is, but still blizzard push this to obtain result far from what other companies can do.</div></div><hr />

Who thinks all these idiotic things up?<br />
<br />
People like you shouldn't even be allowed on the internet. The Dwarf heritage armor was on MMO-C a week or two ago and the team that is working on this has nothing to do with sub numbers or in game systems that could be even tenuously connected to sub numbers.</div></div><hr />

Matching a sword and shield might be tricky. Top of my head, Sunwell stuff seems like the most likely match. The polearm will be a very good match, tho. At work so can't check in-game.</div></div><hr />

I could forgive skirts on paladins since they're partly holy men, like holy warriors, so they have a tie to priests, but a blood elf warrior charging in a skirt is going to look goofy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why couldn't Pandaren learn to wield the arcane? And any race as a warrior can make sense, there is literally zero prerequisite to being a warrior other than training in close quarters combat and picking up a sword and shield.<br />
<br />

No wonder why they had a skirt, that looks even worst, no bits and pieces adorning it. This is too design safe compared to the other heritage armors. Wouldin't be soo bad if they added more to it instead of the standard spray painted on armor texture, maybe some 3d parts to the legs and shoes.</div></div><hr />

Silly me :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Albeit, if we ignore this old problem, I think armor looks decent, especially dress' &quot;folds' art&quot; shadow emulation. By the way don't really see much problem with a dress even (https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/pskAAOSwRQlXddbG/s-l640.jpg) for hunter (https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1mHnVRXXXXXbqXVXXq6xXFXXXj/Sprz-t-wojskowy-Tactical-Airsoft-CS-Kamufla-u-Woodland-Ghillie-Suit-Suchej-Trawy-Pustyni-Stealth-Polowanie.jpg_640x640.jpg). Only сolor speaks against my examples. Like friend's transmogrification (https://imgur.com/yyVXTcJ.jpg) in this sense (was surv-hunter, looks practical, not like some &quot;slut-mgs&quot;), also guild tabard+green shirt use is ~1/2(3) of win here, didn't find of such one when I played, but I suppose it's because I didn't often use this own character.</div></div><hr />

I like the armor... but for some reason I'm not sold on the 'helmet'. I don't know, it just doesn't look good for me, for some reason. I think because it covers so much of the face, I expect it to be an actual helm, instead of just a 'face mask'. I don't know.<br />

Jeesh it looks even more flat in game i really hope the tunic version is unfinished it could do with some more &quot;plating&quot; to make it look less flat maybe some of the hip armor plates kinda like the hunter t19 legs and some more armor on the boots to make them look less like just a pair of socks</div></div><hr />

Not sure what your point with that post was, which, judging by your prior response in that same post, I'm assuming it's a sarcastic remark.<br />
<br />
But to reiterate my point of why I'm not on board with the head gear of the blood elf heritage armor: it covers way too much of the face not to be a helmet, in my opinion. If they just removed those ugly cheek guards, it'd look great. Again, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Time to whip out the good ol' rep tabard and get back to my Stonecore mount farm!<br />
<br />
I don't understand the logic either but Stonecore and other higher level dungeons actually give reduced rep. You get 3 per mob and 80 for a boss. If you wanna get the grind done quickly, you're better off doing TBC dungeons, they give full rep with both the relevant faction for the dungeon and the faction whose tabard you're wearing (15 per mob and 300 per boss). Not sure how things are for LK dungeons, MoP dungeons gave a very small amount aswell, as did vanilla ones. So you might wanna try for the Ravenlord or KT's chicken, unless you already have those, ofcourse.<br />
<br />
Oh, OT: I like the set overall, the legs/boots do look bland and I don't play casters. I might still use it on my paladin, though. The red theme fits nicely with the mount. Kinda wish they came with weapons aswell but oh well.</div></div><hr />

Fuck me in the arse, imagine getting that cloak, this shit looks regal as fuck, a great fit for the blood elves that are already very proud in appearance.

You have a lot more faith in Blizzard than I do. Considering that its been mostly all socks for robe sets since cataclysm till now, I'm fairly confident that those socks are what we are gonna get when the heritage armor goes live.<br />
