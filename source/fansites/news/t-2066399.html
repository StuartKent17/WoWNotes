Legion - Hidden Artifact Appearances<br />
The community has been working towards discovering how to unlock the remaining hidden artifact appearances. These are fairly well hidden, so we thought we would recap and share a little bit more information that may be related. There are still steps that need to be figured out for all three below.<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladin<br />
The Heart of Corruption (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139566-heart-of-corruption) unlocks the Corrupted Ashbringer (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/january/retPaladinArtifact06.jpg) appearance. The entire process is a reference to a post from ten years ago (http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21&amp;mid=1144995122179884380) investigating the Ashbringer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kill Nefarian for Head of Nefarian (http://www.wowdb.com/items/19003-head-of-nefarian)<br />
Make (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/221224-reform-book) a copy of A Complete Copy of &quot;Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin'.&quot; (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139620-a-complete-copy-of-nat-pagles-guide-to-extreme):<br />
<br />
Head to Dire Maul and loot A Thoroughly Read Copy of &quot;Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin'.&quot; (http://www.wowdb.com/items/18365-a-thoroughly-read-copy-of-nat-pagles-guide-to) from A Dusty Tome (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/179548-a-dusty-tome)<br />
Head to Alterac Valley and loot Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin' (http://www.wowdb.com/items/18229-nat-pagles-guide-to-extreme-anglin) from player corpses.<br />
Somehow convince Sister Elda (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/91190-sister-elda) to combine the parts.<br />
<br />
Bring these items (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43682-book-presented) to Prince Tortheldrin (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/11486-prince-tortheldrin) and turn it in (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/221245-quest-complete).<br />
Head to the Bulwark in Tirisfal Glades and talk to the traveler (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/43683-traveler-found) who talks about Timolain.<br />
The Traveler will send you to find Grand Inquisitor Isillien's Journal (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/111121-grand-inquisitor-isilliens-journal) and read it (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43684-notes-read).<br />
Get Timolain's Phylactery (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139623-timolains-phylactery) by killing a slime (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111122-large-vile-slime). <br />
Summon Timolain (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43685-phylactery-used) and get Shard of Darkness (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139624-shard-of-darkness)<br />
Return to your order hall (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43688-shard-delivered) and the final quest, Walking in Shadows (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/139566), rewards the appearance. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Mage<br />
The Woolomancer's Charge (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139558-the-woolomancers-charge) unlocks a sheep appearance for the Arcane Mage artifact. There is a thread on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2060222-Arcane-Mage-Hidden-Artifact-Weapon-clue) where players continue the search.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are different mobs in the Broken Isle zones you can do a one time polymorph on:<br />
<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Azsuna (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43787-zone-targets-polymorphed-azsuna) - Cliffwing Hippogryph (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/89386-cliffwing-hippogryph)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Highmountain (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43788-zone-targets-polymorphed-highmountain) - Highpeak Goat (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/99636-highpeak-goat)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Stormheim (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43789-zone-targets-polymorphed-stormheim) - Plains Runehorn Calf (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/107808-plains-runehorn-calf)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Suramar (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43791-zone-targets-polymorphed-suramar) - Heartwood Doe (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/110043-heartwood-doe)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Val'sharah (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43790-zone-targets-polymorphed-valsharah) - Wild Dreamrunner (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/109819-wild-dreamrunner)<br />
<br />
There is a Sheep Summon Daily Roll (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43828-sheep-summon-daily-roll) quest that we aren't sure how to trigger yet.<br />
There is a Cote &quot;Shepherd&quot; Metcalf (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111704-cote-shepherd-metcalf) NPC that hasn't been located yet. He will be required for the daily attempt to unlock the appearance. <br />
Other related database entries:<br />
<br />
There is a Summoned Sheep Exploded (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43799-summoned-sheep-exploded) and Stormheim Sheep Exploded (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43800-stormheim-sheep-exploded) quest.<br />
These quests are completed by Exploding Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/222362-exploding-sheep) and Exploding Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/221198-exploding-sheep) and then trigger a new dialogue. <br />
There are Summon Volatile Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/222352-summon-volatile-sheep) and Inconceivably Volatile Polymorph (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/224362-inconceivably-volatile-polymorph) spells<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonology Warlock<br />
The Visage of the First Wakener (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139576-visage-of-the-first-wakener) unlocks the hidden appearance for Demonology Warlocks. Much of the process is collecting heads.<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenei Spoken To (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43796-draenei-spoken-to)<br />
Loot Head 1 (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44093-head-1-looted), Head 2 (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44094-head-2-looted), Head 3 (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44095-head-3-looted), Head 4 (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44096-head-4-looted), and Head 5 (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44097-head-5-looted)<br />
Heads: Damaged Eredar Head (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140661-damaged-eredar-head), Deformed Eredar Head (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140662-deformed-eredar-head), Malformed Eredar Head (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140663-malformed-eredar-head), Deficient Eredar Head (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140664-deficient-eredar-head), Nearly Satisfactory Eredar Head (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140665-nearly-satisfactory-eredar-head)<br />

A Note from the WoW Team: Welcome to Legion!<br />
We got a note from J. Allen Brack again after the launch of the Legion, much more positive than last time (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4522-Message-from-J-Allen-Brack-Five-Free-Days-of-Gametime)!<br />
When we launched Legion on August 30, we opened up the Broken Isles to millions of players around the world. As with every expansion, there were feelings of excitement among the team in the lead-up, but also a bit of healthy fear and trepidation. We felt we had learned many lessons from the launch of Warlords of Draenor, and we took steps to help ensure we would have a smooth release. But questions remained: Would the updates to our technology and hardware be enough? Had we tested of all our new and existing systems enough? Did we properly account for the masses of players clicking on Khadgar to watch him teleport the city of Dalaran to its new home?<br />
<br />
When the floodgates opened and players started their journey to the Broken Isles, it was gratifying to see many of you calling this our smoothest launch yet. We couldn’t be happier with how Legion has begun, and we hope that we’ll be able to continue to deliver a smooth experience throughout the expansion and beyond.<br />
<br />
A ton of factors came into play to make this happen, and we wanted to share a few of the design and technological changes we made. First, we took some measures to control the bottlenecks that can occur when many players try to interact with a single quest giver, something that has caused issues in the past. These changes made it so people were able to get into the expansion at a smooth and measured pace before spreading out around the world to claim their Artifacts and choose their first questing zone.<br />
<br />
On the tech side, rather than run one copy of Broken Isles per realm, in Legion we run multiple copies to ensure no one map is overloaded or overpopulated. We also have dedicated hardware for each zone, meaning Azsuna has a server, Highmountain has a server, and so on. Many of these decisions were based on painful lessons from Warlords of Draenor. <br />
<br />
In Legion we also want to ensure you’re able to play together with people you know, so we keep friends, guilds, and groups together rather than spinning them off into different copies. At launch, this allowed us to keep regions of the world feeling populated without impacting game performance. We gave this tech a test-drive during the recent pre-expansion Demon Invasions: rather than seeing an entire realm’s population in one tightly packed location, you saw a smaller portion, but still enough to make an area feel alive. <br />
<br />
How does this all add up? Since launch, players have acquired billions of Artifact Power. More than 5 million Demon Hunters made their way from Mardum to Azeroth to fight against the Legion, and more join the ranks every day. WoW’s concurrency during launch week climbed higher than it’s been in many years, and it’s been awesome to see so many of you having a great time playing together in the Broken Isles. <br />
<br />
It’s also been exciting to see players enjoying the new WoW Legion Companion app, which allows players to engage with Legion champions and missions, customize their Order Halls, and explore World Quests all from their iOS or Android mobile device. <br />
<br />
But the launch of Legion is just the beginning of the journey. As with many of you, we weren’t happy with Warlords of Draenor’s patch cycle, and have changed our strategy for Legion, prioritizing more regular content releases. As part of that, last week at PAX we announced Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan, our first major content update, which reintroduces Karazhan as a 5-player Mythic dungeon, continues the Suramar campaign, adds new World Quests, opens up the Trial of Valor Raid dungeon, and more. <br />
<br />
The future is bright for Legion and World of Warcraft, and we couldn’t thank all of you in the community more. Your enthusiasm, encouragement, and ongoing feedback all help make WoW what it is today. On behalf of the entire team, thank you for being a part of this journey.<br />
<br />
See you on the Broken Isles,<br />
<br />

Legion Developer Q&amp;A Followup - Warlocks<br />
Q&amp;A Summary<br />
One thing that I should have stressed more in discussing warlocks in the Q&amp;A is that we haven't done any class/spec numerical-balance hotfixes yet, for anyone. Initial efforts have been focused on fixing bugs (where possible without waiting for a new patch), and gathering data. The basic concern of &quot;our DPS is low&quot; is one that we can and will address. We just need more data from the live environment, from all 24 DPS specs, in order to inform the exact changes we'll be making. <br />
<br />
But warlocks should absolutely be numerically competitive with other damage-dealers, and we'll make sure that's the case.<br />
<br />
The Soul Shard change got a lot of attention just because it's something that we can handle via hotfix. Concerns such as artifact trait design, visual issues, and rotational flow could only be tackled via a future patch, and are a topic of discussion among the class team.<br />
<br />
Your feedback is being read and discussed, and threads like http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748795049 are excellent. If it sounded like I was saying we were literally unable to find any quality feedback, that certainly wasn't my intent. I understand frustration when it seems like valid concerns are being ignored, but constructive feedback is always more helpful. We both want the same thing here: for you to have fun playing your class. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/763364-qa-summary/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749046650?page=2#24))<br />
<br />
Warlock Feedback<br />
What he said was that while reading feedback and trying to find constructive posts, it doesn't help to see things like &quot;REROLLING&quot; and various petition threads (which are against the forum Code of Conduct, FYI). This is actually a valid point when it comes to the way feedback has been provided.<br />
<br />
Those kind of statements don't help provide any kind of context or feedback to the developers as to what the state of the complaints are. I've said this in this forum before, but we really have found use in the collated lists of feedback that have been made here. Posts that are made that detract from an orderly discussion doesn't help to push your feedback forward. There's no denying that Warlocks are upset, and the forums have been busy - but the trolling and spamming, the grouping up to downvote any Q&amp;A questions not to do with Warlocks, etc., really isn't the way to promote discussion.<br />
<br />
As Watcher said, he personally is aware of the complaints that Warlocks have put forth, and the development team is working on making some changes and seeing where Warlocks land after that.<br />
<br />
I agree, but shouldn't he have been able to at least find the threads that you've posted in? Because from what he said, it sounds like he couldn't.<br />
I assure you, the threads where players worked to get all their feedback together were sent over.<br />
<br />
Serious question man, why isn't there more direct communication between devs (or even CMs like yourself) in the forums? I really believe that so much of this negativity would have been avoided by just having a simple dialog every once in a while and letting us know that what we're saying really is being read.<br />
We've had some failing on our part, communications wise, but the conversations we've had over the last couple of weeks has helped to push along the feedback everyone has provided.<br />
<br />
If we didn't do this, we never would have gotten an answer at all. We HAD to. It was our only available option left after legitimate constructive feedback was completely ignored for months.<br />
<br />
AND IT WORKED.<br />
Most of the spamming and downvote spamming started in the last few days, well after I dropped in even to gather more feedback to send along - so I would go so far as to say it really didn't help much.<br />
<br />
Again, all of your work and information gathering was sent over. We will continue iterating on Warlock changes, starting with the Soul Shard change, and we will see where Warlocks land after that.<br />
<br />
@Ornyx, if you don't mind my asking, will we see devs sitting down to actually discuss the changes they are planning for Warlocks, relatively soon? Or will it be a matter of just checking hotfix notes every week? <br />
If you're asking if they will pop in here and have conversations, we will see what happens. I will try, at least, to gather some of their thoughts and philosophies on the changes (or lack thereof) and share that here.<br />
<br />
As I've said over and over again here, we are aware of the feedback and I'm still here reading.<br />
<br />
I think we're going to step back a bit here and let the forum calm down a bit over the weekend.<br />
<br />
Looking at the changes Ion proposed in the Q&amp;A, let us know what you think about Soul Stones being expanded to sit at 3 out of combat; this is the first change we are looking at making, and any feedback you guys provide on this will help our thinking overall.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your thoughts and feedback so far, and, again, let's keep this forum constructive. Enjoy the rest of the Q&amp;A and have a good weekend everyone!

<br />
There are several others that are unknown and we didn't really have anything useful to share yet. <br />
<br />
There was this for Balance Druid, but it could just be like the Fire Mage, flavor NPCs for a little extra Artifact Power:<br />
<br />
<br />
There are six different Druids of the Scythe quests (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-search=Druid%20Scythe). Some of these can be completed by freeing different Druid of the Scythe NPCs in Val'sharah. <br />
You will need to visit Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112820-feral-worgen), Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112818-feral-worgen), Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112812-feral-worgen), and the southernmost Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112612-feral-worgen). <br />
Freeing these NPCs will complete 4 of the 6 Druids of the Scythe quests. <br />
There are two other Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112612-feral-worgen) that spawn that can't be interacted with like the others. <br />
We aren't sure how to complete the other two quests or interact with the two remaining NPCs.<br />
The first NPC you free tells you that he and a few others of his kind came through the Emerald Dream and went their separate ways (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/balanceDruidHA1.jpg).</div></div><hr />

There is no denying: yes, there are Warlock players whose posts are out of line. However, they do not disqualify the hundreds of reasonable, constructive posts made over the course of months in beta feedback prior to launch that got ignored.<br />
<br />
Those issues launched un-fixed and in some cases were made worse, with little to no feedback from the class team. There is plenty reason to be fed up and upset in a reasonable manner - as I would point out that many of us are.<br />
<br />
And now, those responsible for interacting with us and addressing these class issues are instead complaining about dealing with hateful internet people (their job) who are somewhat understandably upset.</div></div><hr />

The hidden effect is not a hidden skin, or updated third relic skin. It's just an innate ability of the artifact that's not written anywhere so you just have to find out about it.</div></div><hr />

I don't like it, but it's what works. Squeaky wheel gets the grease, quiet gets ignored.<br />
<br />
Don't forget a lot of us Warlocks want specs that actually feel good to play (like enhancement) not just numbers (numbers always get changed anyway), and we definitely sympathize with other specs in need (like Ret)</div></div><hr />

Don't even try and make out that those justify being awful in combat. Remember that the combat res only works if you kill what killed you within eight seconds. Useless for instances; and frankly with the state of Fury at the moment, it's pretty awful for solo world questing too.</div></div><hr />

One of the beliefs is that you have to finish all the work orders she gives first, so you have maximum artifact knowledge.<br />

Might be it, but by that logic nobody can have the skins yet, since it takes like 50 days to get all 10, and we are only 2 weeks into legion<br />

<br />
They aren't even close to this. Play ret, you will see what I mean. You know there is a huge problem when playing in your prot set on one target yields close to ret numbers. There is little incentive to play it because questing is quite a bit easier as prot. Survivability is way higher on prot. Two mobs can easily take you to sub 40% in this expansion. Don't even get me started on why holy doesn't have a true interrupt anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of them implicitly or explicitly require 110 (like ones that require a raid drop or being Revered with a particular faction), but some don't. For example, the Beast Master &quot;hidden&quot; appearance is just sitting on a vendor waiting to be purchased (I bought mine at level 100).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not playing Legion, but I'd like to say that these hidden quests are exactly the kind of things the game needed - long, complicated puzzles to reward the explorers and experimenters. They don't effect DPS, so the raiders can't complain or demand to make it easier.</div></div><hr />

No active work orders would just lead to a &quot;No active orders&quot; order page. Just like if you went up and talked to the troop recruiters when they have nothing there.<br />
<br />
Also it's a unique situation to ret paladins specifically, everyone else gets their hidden skins in a different way. I mean, BM Hunters just buy theirs from an NPC in Dal.</div></div><hr />

The spamming threads and the useless bumping and the race to cap threads so you can make more threads to bump pointlessly and all that other nonsense that goes on, it contributes absolutely nothing and achieves absolutely nothing and has absolutely no effect on the end result. The devs read the constructive feedback, they're aware of it, they're working on it, there will be items on very long lists for all the issues I'm sure and all the spamming in the world isn't going to change the priority of anything on that list. It will be fixed when its fixed, and trying to claim all the random nonsense that gets posted is somehow the catalyst that got it done is like me trying to claim I made the sun come up by slaughtering that goat.</div></div><hr />

That's my question. It has steps on there, with a big red &quot;somehow&quot; on one of them. I tried up to that point, got the items that have been in the game since vanilla, and nothing happened.

Some are. Hunters have two one you just buy from a vendor and another you buy with Rep. So ya some are in the game. Also do we know that there is only 1 hidden skin per weapon? Because if there is only one I don't see how its fair the easy ones are there but some aren't.</div></div><hr />

I found a hidden Destruction skin on the 4th. It dropped off the Ritual of Doom daily. (Think it was a dreadlord one)<br />
<br />
The one all the way to the right. (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/f/f6/ScepterofSargerasModels.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151119194502)<br />
<br />
Saddly I dont play destro. All the luck wasted on those that dont need it, ehy?<br />
<br />
[Edit]: Btw, it's called Legionterror. It's other variants are unlocked via completing 100 dungeons while using it.(Blue), 200 world quests(Green) and killing 1000 enemy players(purple)</div></div><hr />

The Bonereaper's Hook (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139548-the-bonereapers-hook). Commenters on Wowhead currently speculate that it is tied to the class order hall talent, Reanimation (http://www.wowdb.com/orderhall/talents/431-reanimation).</div></div><hr />

It's like Kosusomething, it's it impossible to do the quest without already knowing how to do it, don't make us believe some people &quot;worked&quot; to find that kind of things who have almost random aspects and no link between them.<br />
<br />
Kosumoth puzzle was disabled entirely on beta, we were looking for Long-Forgotten Hippogryph and during questing/exploration we found these suspicious caves before, then someone found drak'thul and relic which then allowed you to click these suspicious red orbs in these caves but they were &quot;Hungering Orb&quot; so it was instantly clear this is for Kusomoth the Hungering, then someone also noticed a odd alignment with found orbs and stones on drak'thuls table which allowed us to find them all.<br />
<br />
Btw we also found how to obtain Long-Forgotten Hippogryph soon after but it was a huge disappointment because it was just clicking a bunch of rare crystals.</div></div><hr />

The affliction skin is known. There is a super rare drop from the Eredar in Aszuna that starts a quest to kill a bunch of the elite world quest mobs. You gather their skulls and eventually summon satiel and kill her for the skin.</div></div><hr />

There was this for Balance Druid, but it could just be like the Fire Mage, flavor NPCs for a little extra Artifact Power:<br />
<br />
<br />
There are six different Druids of the Scythe quests (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-search=Druid%20Scythe). Some of these can be completed by freeing different Druid of the Scythe NPCs in Val'sharah. <br />
You will need to visit Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112820-feral-worgen), Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112818-feral-worgen), Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112812-feral-worgen), and the southernmost Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112612-feral-worgen). <br />
Freeing these NPCs will complete 4 of the 6 Druids of the Scythe quests. <br />
There are two other Feral Worgen (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112612-feral-worgen) that spawn that can't be interacted with like the others. <br />
We aren't sure how to complete the other two quests or interact with the two remaining NPCs.<br />
The first NPC you free tells you that he and a few others of his kind came through the Emerald Dream and went their separate ways (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/balanceDruidHA1.jpg).<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure if this helps but i went to Karazhan on my 80 hunter and got killed in deadwind pass by 2 level ?? feral worgens. They jumped me right on a bend just before the ogres fighting the spiders section.</div></div><hr />

Those are related to the artifact quest (that you do at lvl 102). Unfortunately :(</div></div><hr />

Ok it seems people are just not sure why it doesn't drop at the moment. Perhaps similar to the paladin hidden skin where you need a specific artifact knowledge.</div></div><hr />
