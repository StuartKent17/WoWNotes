No blue post today as it was a holiday week-end, at this point we're just waiting for Patch 4.1 to hit the PTRs anyway. (Or official Patch 4.1 previews, I guess!)<br />

Battleground Horde/Alliance Win Ratio<br />
People often wonder what the Horde/Alliance win ratio in battlegrounds are, Blizzard never gave away those % but the question can be answered by scanning a lot of characters on the Armory and compiling their battlegrounds wins statistics. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. The first scan has been made a year ago. <br />
<br />
<br />
2. The &quot;Battles in the Last Year&quot; graph is basically this month's scan minus the results of last year's scan. Deleted/transfered characters were removed from the stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Even if the amount of people scanned is huge, don't take these stats as a 100% truth. Only Blizzard can be 100% sure of that, especially since it's very hard to gather a lot of data from the Armory.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Before you yell on forums, make sure you look at the % on the left, the lowest % is 42% and the highest is 58%. <br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;Battlegrounds Wins in the Last Year&quot; graph is the only thing you should look at if you want an idea of how things are balanced these days. <br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Sandy Bridge motherboards were recalled because of a flaw in one of the SATA ports (see Sandy Bridge (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge)). They will not be available for purchase at least until March or April. New SSDs are almost here (http://www.anandtech.com/show/4159/ocz-vertex-3-pro-preview-the-first-sf2500-ssd), faster and more expensive than the current generation.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Does this prove that there are more older/more mature players horde side OR are there better pvp racials attracting these players to horde?<br />
<br />
Racials don't change battlegrounds. That's like arguing gem choice changes DPS by thousands.<br />
<br />
Arguing that the better racials (IF that were true) could attract the better players is possible, I guess, but impossible to prove.<br />
<br />
Edit: A real interesting thing is that after you account for queue time, who gets more Honor per hour? Probably is about even since the Horde queues are so long.</div></div><hr />

1) Battlegrounds in general are unbalanced due to the BGs themselves being designed in a way that favors the horde ever so slightly.<br />
2) Horde players have better racials for PvP<br />
3) There are more hardcore PvPers on the horde side which means they have longer bg queues and only those most dedicated bother playing BGs (so you end up with hardcore horde vs. hardcore + casual alliance BGs).<br />
<br />
Also, I can see why horde keeps losing AV, In my experience horde BG players are actually less organized than alliance (for pure PUG BGs, not talking guild groups) but tend to be a bit more hardcore (better geared, actually have their keybinds setup specifically for PvP and such). Now, in AV it's all about cooperation and zerging the boss, something which the alliance players do quite well while the horde players tend to fan out and go for the regular &quot;duel in the middle&quot; tactic...</div></div><hr />

Considering many PvP enthusiasts are immature little kids (still skilled), no. <br />
<br />
<br />
OR are there better pvp racials attracting these players to horde?<br />
<br />
Yes. Horde racials are better for both PvE and PvP. Those racials don't tip the balance in favor of Horde, but the fact that better players tend to choose Horde because of them does.</div></div><hr />

The flaw in P67 Mobo's has temporarily put a stop to things, but keep in mind that the new processors still absolutely blow away the previous generations when it comes to performance, efficiency and overclocking. They are worth waiting for. <br />
AMD's Bulldozer series will also put a hole through previous generations (I'm speculating here, but if they didn't then nobody would buy them).<br />
<br />
So again, do not go for these builds unless you're on a very strict budget or absolutely desperate for a computer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It proves neither. <br />
<br />
Win % in a BG doesn't mean that the players are more mature or older, it just proves that those players are playing to win. Racials also wouldn't have that much of a swing on win % either way. <br />
<br />
Alliance has always had a lot more &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;just for fun&quot; types though, likely because those players who may just be breaking into the genre generally feel more comfortable with the general fantasy races of humans and elves. Alternatively, Horde has always (imo) felt more &quot;srs bisnes guyz&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way, the balance (despite not using the best way to show this) is quite even. When the largest difference is 58% to 42% that's quite nice balance wise.<br />
It seems to me horde are overal slightly ahead, mostly because as said the hardcore pvp'ers go with horde for stuff like arena. Not that the racials help in BGs, but because the best players chose horde racials for arena (although surprisingly in tournaments you see quite a lot of ally setups).<br />
<br />
AV is clearly in favor for alliance, probably for 2 reasons: 1) The advantage of being a good pvp'er is less noticable in a PvE'esque fight like this and 2) Alliance hold a clear map advantage here, both from locations, to terrain, placement of NPCs and the fact you can defend towers much easier than bunkers.<br />
<br />
Either way i wouldnt get too mental over these numbers. When the total balance is 54% to 46%; that's REALLY good for an MMO.</div></div><hr />

I'm also skeptical of the collection methods. There's a lot of variables that those numbers don't take into account probably. It would be nice if Blizzard would give us the actual data, but this is the best we can get I suppose.</div></div><hr />

How's your &quot;once per year&quot; scan takes into account this?<br />

Oh the graphs sure arent 100% accurate. But the fact that they show wins and losses are &quot;almost&quot; the same on both sides i tend to believe these numbers could be close to reality.<br />

Sure they do - they can easily be the determining factor in certain key moments. ESPECIALLY when used by high caliber players.<br />
<br />
I have a WSG win percentage of 75% (!) as a Draenei (186 games played); and believe me when I say I could be even more effective with the AOE silence because it would permit far more kills against groups with heals. I certainly would not consider it a stretch to be able to add 5% with access to better racials, and that does line up fairly well with MMOs parsed averages.</div></div><hr />

1) Battlegrounds in general are unbalanced due to the BGs themselves being designed in a way that favors the horde ever so slightly.<br />
2) Horde players have better racials for PvP<br />
3) There are more hardcore PvPers on the horde side which means they have longer bg queues and only those most dedicated bother playing BGs (so you end up with hardcore horde vs. hardcore + casual alliance BGs).<br />
<br />
Also, I can see why horde keeps losing AV, In my experience horde BG players are actually less organized than alliance (for pure PUG BGs, not talking guild groups) but tend to be a bit more hardcore (better geared, actually have their keybinds setup specifically for PvP and such). Now, in AV it's all about cooperation and zerging the boss, something which the alliance players do quite well while the horde players tend to fan out and go for the regular &quot;duel in the middle&quot; tactic...<br />

If there are any faction changes over about an average of 5% more pvp horde wins then those people are tards. That graph however accurate it may be is ridiculously misleading and should be ignored imo. The percentage difference in Horde to Alliance wins is too small to make a difference to serious pvpers and those who pvp for fun only shouldnt give a crap but I guess the arguments over racials etc have already started.</div></div><hr />

1) The strength of a free trinket is determined by the availability of alternate trinkets.<br />
2) A free heal at ~20% looses value the more players there are stacked up. Its a strong 1v1 ability, and quite useful in arenas - but becomes much weaker the more players there are grouped up. This happens a lot in BGs.<br />
<br />
AoE silences and Stuns on the contrary, become stronger as it allows locking down large amounts of players. 2 seconds against a group of 4 is a very long time. 20% heal on the other hand, is perhaps at best half a seconds worth of DPS time - and bear in mind that heal itself is a HOT, not an immediate heal - so is susceptible to group based burst strikes.</div></div><hr />

true, but nothing pisses me off more than dropping hoj on a healer to get the kill only to find they are immune due to DR. <br />

a 2 sec stun, even if it does effect the max 5 ppl, is not very long at all. And with the new pvp environment it is even worse.</div></div><hr />

Patently absurd. Those have never been useful for aoe outside of pve, in pvp they are extremely situational talents and only really useful when dealing with one target. If you're getting ganged on by multiple targets, neither of those racials is going to save the day for you at all, they won't make or break a fight with few or one target(s) either unless used at a specific moment where the target does not have time to react before dying.<br />
<br />
So, ya indisputably, Every Man for Himself is infinitely superior for pvp to Arcane Torrent and War Stomp, no question about it.<br />
<br />
The reason why alliance loses more bgs has everything to do with Alliance generally being a haven of poor quality players, and while I might be generalizing a bit, there's definitely some truth that older casual players and younger kids tend to play Alliance and those players tend to be bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teleruin</div><div class="date">2011-02-22, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason is this.<br />
<br />
When signing up for a BG with Alliance you wait max 2 minuttes before you can enter. As horde you wait minimum 20 min.<br />
<br />
When Alliance start loosing ground in any BG, half the team stops fighting and just try to loose fast enough so that they can enter a new one where the chanses to win is higher.<br />
When Horde starts loosing grouind they still fight all they can, becasue they have waited 20 mins for this fight, and will have to wait 20 mins to get a new one.<br />
They simply have much more to loose than allies have.<br />
<br />
And ofc people who fights to the bitter end and does not quit when things looks grim wins more.</div></div><hr />

Arenas I don't disagree. But again, not in BGs.<br />

Defensively - no racial will save you (they can all equally buy you a few seconds, but no more). Offensively, they can make the entire difference, especially if you know how to chain lockdowns.

It doesn't matter if you disagree or not, Arcane Torrent and War Stomp never have the significant effect in battlegrounds you're implying it does. Ever. 2 seconds of silences or stuns is nothing in pvp (especially when it comes to latency) when you're surrounded by enough people to actually effect multiple targets. Only has an 8 yard range, which pretty much means if they're that close to you and in large numbers, you're gonna die.</div></div><hr />

They're all within acceptable amounts, no real run away in any battleground for either side, which is good to see. EotS is a 16 point spread, but it's still far from the days in Vanilla where it felt like I would win WSG maybe 20% on alliance side.<br />
<br />
Also remembering the old flamewars about Horde base vs Alliance base in AV, ah good times those. I do miss those long 12 hour battles. I wouldn't stay for the whole thing of course, but there was something epic about fighting tooth and nail to keep them off your GY and Towers.

<br />
We assumed that the difference in quality was partly due to the fact that the average Horde PVPer would simply have played more than the equivalently keen Alliance, and partly due to what Rilec was saying about new people coming to the genre and sticking with the 'good guys'. Certainly the teamwork on the Alliance side was horrible compared with the Horde.</div></div><hr />

2 seconds is actually a lot in pvp if you know how to appropriately use and chain disruptive cooldowns. 2 seconds is all it takes to get someone from 10% to 0, have them drop the flag they're carrying (or kill the supporting healer) - and return it to base to score.<br />
<br />
Its not 'just' 2 seconds, its 2 seconds on top of other forms of CC (varying in efficiency depending on the classes involved - yes). And that can make a significant difference when used appropriately. Now fortunately, a lot of horde (including you seemingly) don't use them that well - and its not infrequent I find myself getting torrented (in particular) completely unwarranted, even in 1v1s. But when used by a good player - it can be incredibly potent. Is it situational? Yes. But those situations are going to occur every now and then - and when they do, those racials are incredible. Alliance does not have any comparable racial which can equally influence 'the moment' like that.</div></div><hr />

If you don't take the time to actually read them properly they make it look like horde is massively winning in all BG's except for AV....<br />
<br />
For the record the results for the past years BG's show 54/46 win ratio in favour of the horde.... in other words it's very close to perfectly balanced. If alliance won an extra 2 BG's out of 100 it would be perfectly balanced and that really is nothing. Even something as small as the horde having slightly better racials could be enough to explain the slightly better results for horde....<br />
<br />
Guess this ends all the &quot;horde always win all the BG's debate&quot;.<br />
<br />
P.S a mod should really update this post and sort out those graphs.... or get rid of them and just state the results in % numbers as even that would be clearer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Horde dominates because of inherent people orientation disparity. In short, more pvp-oriented people play horde because they think Horde is more bad ass. Which means the percentage of people who are &quot;mediocre +&quot; at pvp is higher in Horde than Alliance. This in itself explains that statistically, you have less &quot;really bad&quot; players on the horde side in a battleground.<br />
<br />
- Because it is the only map not following that pattern, it is safe to say that Alterac Valley is an unbalanced map. It has been for 5 years, so nothing new here. It just gives proof of it. All in all, it's not that bad since it gives at least one map where Alliance has an easier time farming achievements ! :)</div></div><hr />

hordes wins more in all the bgs excep av i think that most of the ppl that doing pvp for a long time they know this.<br />
<br />
But even it is nice to have a picture of what happens in bgs in general i don't think that it is really accurate one.<br />
i am saying this because my stats have bugged since i downloaded the last patch before cataclysm.<br />
<br />
so my win ratio is about 75% on my main char.but if you check my stats on armory it says that i have a win ratio 50% <br />
also since cata was launced every win i do it counts as a lose......<br />
i talked with a lot of gms and did what they told me to do ( delete wtf and other folders delete addons do rpr etc.) <br />
nothing fixed it and my stats are bugged.<br />
<br />
so i don't think i am the only one that has this issue propably more ppl from both sides have it so i am afraid the stats from the graphic might not be so accurate.<br />
<br />
from my PERSONAL experience and only from that which means it is a tiny sample of bg games horde have a 25% higher win ratio on every bg except av.</div></div><hr />

Now if we could only see TB as well...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also remembering the old flamewars about Horde base vs Alliance base in AV, ah good times those. I do miss those long 12 hour battles. I wouldn't stay for the whole thing of course, but there was something epic about fighting tooth and nail to keep them off your GY and Towers. They werent the most fun I've ever had, but it's better than the rushfest that it turned into.<br />
<br />
Just five people can completely screw the &quot;zerg&quot; tactic, and we generally do if we're running BGs in my guild. Just hang about and recap your bunkers/towers, move between them often. The fight really bogs down and you end up going for a reinforcement victory (one or two people taking mines is good as well). Not quite the &quot;epic&quot; fights of vanilla, but makes the whole experience in AV much better than the PvE race it became.<br />
<br />
Also, I've never agreed with the (apparent) ally bias in AV. I always found it much easier to ride all the way into the alliance base on my horde toon, remember when the horde gate dismounted you (great times...), and the bottleneck on the alliance side meant they could effectively be contained in the top half of the map while no such bottleneck exists on the horde side (granted this works both ways, but it always seemed easier to take and hold that point as horde despite it being in the ally half of the map).</div></div><hr />

Alliance folks tend to be very pragmatic about their choices. Not getting involved if they don't see a clear finality in things.<br />
PvPing just for the sake of it and running into &quot;middle duelers&quot; is not a good incentive enough.</div></div><hr />

2) Horde players have better racials for PvP<br />
3) There are more hardcore PvPers on the horde side which means they have longer bg queues and only those most dedicated bother playing BGs (so you end up with hardcore horde vs. hardcore + casual alliance BGs).<br />

Instead whoever made the graphs did the scaling from 40-60 which i assume he or she did just to trick the public with shiny graphs that shows their faction massivly own or massivly suck in bgs.

<br />
Actually, the population size is imbalanced exactly in the opposite direction - it's around 54% Alliance, 46% Horde.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of it is the snowball effect - People think Horde win more (and are viewed as more &quot;badass&quot;) - &quot;ZOMG HORDE ALWAYS WINS IN PVP&quot; - so a lot of hardcore pvpers switched (or started out there originally).<br />
<br />

<br />
Horde is perceived as the 'better' PvP faction so the hardcore tend to be on that side. I'm on a PvP realm and once they allowed cross-faction transfers a lot of the top PvP'ers defected to horde.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that people tend to favour queuing for the BG that their faction has done better at.<br />
<br />
AV is interesting. Technically, the terrain gives a free win to horde every time by kettling at the IB graveyard choke point. But people prefer to zerg the bosses still rather than go for a win based on resources because zerg'ing is quicker and gives more honour to everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pie charts would be horrible. Bars work best for this kind of data, but since the total of red and blue always equals 100, it might have been nicer to have single bars split into two colours. Blue at the top, red at the bottom.<br />
<br />
As for the people complaining about the scale, yeah it would be nice for idiots not to jump to conclusions, but with the amount of data it is perfectly accurate to look at values in this scale to see the slight differences.<br />
<br />
And finally for the people planning to transfer to Horde, I wouldn't notice if I lost 54% of the time rather than 50% of the time. Its close enough that an individual persons effort makes all the difference. I'm sure skills at PvP will tip the scales in your favour.<br />
<br />
I bet the horde want the alliance racials as much as the alliance want the horde racials. Personally, I'm annoyed that maces have been the best tanking weapons for so long. As an Orc I want axes, but instead the Dwarves have had the weaponry bonus for tanking for over a year.</div></div><hr />

It's like 4 bgs out of 100 extra that horde win.... about 4%. It's balanced. Taken as a whole and not just the last year its only 2%....<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. Horde racials are better for both PvE and PvP. Those racials don't tip the balance in favor of Horde, but the fact that better players tend to choose Horde because of them does.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, sore words. Many PvP enthusiasts are immature little kids? That's quite the generalization, and I think, if you researched, you'd find that the general age goes from 18 to 25. People can decide for themselves, have the time and all that.<br />
<br />
Another thing that bugs me in this topic is that BGs are somehow better for the Horde? The only landscape failure I've seen in BGs is in AV, when you pass IW bunker to go to SP graveyard. A tiny little ledge that is quite easy to control, makes it a perfect bottleneck. Horde has similar, but not in the extent.<br />
<br />
And on the PvP racials? Let me count some amazing alliance ones. <br />
<br />
Stoneform - Activate to remove poison, disease, and bleed effects; +10% Armor; Lasts 8 seconds. 2 minute cooldown.<br />
Escape Artist - Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect. Instant cast. 1.45 min cooldown. <br />
Every Man for Himself -Removes all movement impairing effects and all effects which cause loss of control of your character. This effect shares a cooldown with other similar effects, 2 minute cooldown. <br />
Shadowmeld - Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Any threat is restored versus enemies still in combat upon cancellation of this effect, 2 minute cooldown. <br />
Gift of the Naaru - Heals the target for 20% of their total health over 15 sec. 3 minute cooldown. <br />
Darkflight - Activates your true form, increasing movement speed by 40% for 10 sec. 3 minute cooldown. <br />
<br />
And those are just the active ones, every single one of them is quite useful in PvP.<br />
<br />
The Horde has their own good ones for PvP, more agressive than these, but you still can't say they're &quot;overpowering&quot; the alliance ones.</div></div><hr />

I think a lot of it is the snowball effect - People think Horde win more (and are viewed as more &quot;badass&quot;) - &quot;ZOMG HORDE ALWAYS WINS IN PVP&quot; - so a lot of hardcore pvpers switched (or started out there originally).<br />
<br />
The fact that Alliance has more players but longer queues should show this.<br />
It is not that way on any of the really high or even medium populated realms, and that means quite a bit more than your claim that there are more Alliance overall than Horde, which honestly I find very hard to believe.</div></div><hr />

But then the bunkers/towers favour the Alliance. The graph for AV looks pretty balanced, but if we take the assumption that the players of the Horde are better by 4% as suggested by many people above, then the AV graph shows that it favours the Alliance since they aren't losing by 4%.</div></div><hr />

''What?.. Alliance wins AV more than the Horde? well.. AV favors the Alliance''<br />
<br />
What did u say?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CharBroiled</div><div class="date">2011-02-22, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's always been known that Horde beat Ally in most battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
A little surprised that they're winning more AV this year after last year.<br />
<br />
Assuming my graph interpretation skills aren't completely failing me, it appears that Horde are actually getting BETTER at AV (the only bg in which alliance seems to be at an advantage), than are Alliance. The total data (2nd chart) shows a huge win-advantage in favor of Alliance, but last year's data (1st chart) shows that gap closing. Now I don't really care one whit about pvp, despite residing on a pvp server. But it does make me sad that, for some reason or another, horde have such an obvious pvp advantage all across the board. The only refuge, of sorts, that Alliance seem to have is in AV... and that's shrinking rapidly.<br />
<br />
Now for those of you looking at this data and saying &quot;oh that's not that bad, only a 10% advantage in WG?&quot;... I don't really know the sample size in this study, but if I remember my statistics, 3% is usually considered &quot;statistically significant&quot; for a sample size of about 1600. Somehow I get the feeling the sample size here is somewhere on that order, possibly larger. So... 10% advantage is a HUGE FREAKING DEAL, though that's just in WG. The average advantage across all bgs in the last year is about 8.47% in favor of the Horde. The worst part... that appears to be up from an advantage of .62% from overall data... that means the gap is WIDENING! I mean think about it: as an alliance player, if I queue up for a random bg... I immediately have a handicap. If I played 100 games in a row, I am basically losing 8-9 of those games for NO OTHER REASON than that I chose blue instead of red as my faction color. That's just terrible and requires some balancing, and it's getting worse!<br />
<br />
If the problem is racials or terrain, those things need to be adjusted. If the problem is that the horde just attracts more hard-core pvpers and/or they're better organized... well that needs to be addressed to. Possible suggestions: somehow attract better pvpers to the alliance side until it's balanced or (and everyone's gonna whine and moan about this idea but) purposely buff alliance pvp stats/racials/something so that &quot;in theory&quot; Alliance has an advantage vs Horde. It might mean giving all alliance an extra 1% stamina in bgs or something; I have no idea. I know, on the surface that sounds obviously unfair. But if buffing alliance stamina in BGs by 1% pushes the alliance-horde victory ratio close to 50-50... isn't that fair? Isn't what the empirical data tells you in the end more important than what seems &quot;fair&quot; at first glance?</div></div><hr />

No contest ? what the hell are you on about ? I'd rather have the AOE stun or the AOE silence. An extra dps trinket won't do you any good on BG's, battles are usually not decided about burst anymore due to the scaling of hp/dmg of spells unlike, say, wotlk or tbc. As for the healing trinket, yeah, it doesn't affect me as much as the dps case, though using the pvp trinkets for the resilience alone is better, imo.

<br />
if this was out of 100 games played then yeah its close.<br />
<br />
If its out of millions no its not close at all.<br />
<br />
I suggest that for you too. In a binary scenario like win/lose a 50%/50% distribution would be the expected. A 48%/52% or even a 45%/55% distribution would still be very close that expectation and considered an even distribution. <br />
The point is it was claimed alot by alot of people that alliance loses MOST of their BGs. With MOST being used for ~70%. This distribution tries to show that the numbers are much more together than these people claimed. Nothing more nothing else. The point is most players just play the 100 games you mentioned and some experience a 30%win/70%lose ratio for themselves and assume its like that in general. Thats what this distribution can show partially. Its not a matter of a general imbalance when you are experiencing such ratios.</div></div><hr />

Those aren't hard facts, they are just generalizations. Each side has people good at certain things, it's just how the cookie crumbles though.<br />
Those generalizations are also quite a bit off. Alliance, as a matter of fact has quite a few of the best pvpers in the world on their side. Namely, people like Reckful, Billian, Brewkz, and not to mention the best pvp guild in the world, formerly known as We Met on E Harmony (which is composed entirely of multi-season glads), from Mal'ganis, which used to be horde and faction changed specifically because of extreme faction imbalance, just for example.<br />
<br />
In fact many of the best pvpers went alliance in WOTLK specifically because of the Every Man for Himself racial.<br />
<br />
Also, horde guilds indisputably dominate pve. There are far more horde guilds in the top 100 than alliance, hell there's even a significant number of more horde guilds going in to the top 1000 and above.</div></div><hr />

How exactly would you go about using maths to prove a situational racial vs other situational racials.<br />
Every Man for Himself is amazing, don't get me wrong. I wish I had it instead of blood fury for sure. To sit there and say it's the best though is just impossible.<br />
There are times when Warstomp will cover a cyclone, times when BE silence will win you a game.<br />

<br />
Given the fact that it's currently 48-52 in favor of horde, that is a very reasonable margin of error to not require a buff in any shape or form.<br />
If I flipped a coin 5000 times, a chance which is inherantly exactly 50/50, I would not get results which showed that perfectly.<br />
It's also unreasonable to suggest racials are the reason for this. Battlegrounds as a whole are about proper movement and positioning relative to the rest of your group.<br />
A racial will perhaps turn the tide of a 2on2 fight. They won't turn the tide of any large battle, which is what should be occuring if you play correctly.<br />
Racials are nice niches. They arent -that- significant though. If you were a good enough player for example, you could get gladiator, on any race. Hoodrych for example, a well renowned warrior, went Worgan. Losing EMFH is a loss, but not a big deal as that shows.<br />
<br />
The only thing that graph shows is an obvious discrepancy for terrain in AV.<br />
This has been known for years though, towers harder to cap for horde, chope points ranging from the entire road from SH to SP, and then again at a bridge leading into the base.<br />
Spawning BEHIND nodes in graveyards, forcing you to move past the flag in order to progress out into the valley. (As opposed to horde IBGY where you spawn infront of the node)<br />
Etcetc.<br />
There will never be 50/50 win loss, and you should never try to achieve that.<br />
Racials are very minor, while they may need some adjustment it is of very low priority in comparison to how much impact terrain has.<br />
Terrain, specifically in the battlegrounds which are massivly asymmetrical (Not for example twin peaks which while asymmetrical has a reasonably small margin of differences in which to say it doesn't overly favor one side.)</div></div><hr />

But you can get pvp trinkets with dps/healer stats as well X_X and by your logic, AOE CC like the tauren racial can also decide who wins games, coupled with the BE racial...<br />

<br />
The problem as I see it is not anything about balacne, but just a simple matter:<br />
On almost all servers, Horde has to wait at least 10 minutes for a BG, alliance has instant invites.<br />
<br />
So after waiting those damn 10 to 15 minutes, Horde players just WANT to win this bg to get their daily done etc. Alliance players in general (yes this is my oppinion bases on personal experience on both sides) do NOT care if they win, they can just instant re-queue.<br />
As to why alliance wins alterac more often, I don´t care what arguments anyone brings, this BG is since its creation extremely alliance biased.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Players drive to win and actually play the battleground, we tend to have a &quot;its to hard, i give up&quot; attitude.<br />
2. Gear, obviously there are those bgs where you get unlucky and the opponent seems to have a noticeable gear difference compared to your allies.<br />
3. BG Class Composition, sometimes you just get unlucky and are matched agaisnt a much better set up that limits what your team can do, this could be in the form of no healers, or too many.<br />
<br />
On my warrior I tend to try and do my utmost to win bgs and in most I have 50+ win percentage, and over the course of thousands of bgs these are the factors that seem to make the most difference, and obviously teamwork does go a miss sometimes and its pretty much a guaranteed loss.</div></div><hr />

Every Man for Himself is amazing, don't get me wrong. I wish I had it instead of blood fury for sure. To sit there and say it's the best though is just impossible.<br />
There are times when Warstomp will cover a cyclone, times when BE silence will win you a game.<br />
Theres just all sorts of factors that you can't possibly prove with maths.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much well put. I'm not saying that I hate every man for himself, because I don't. There's certainly worse racials pvp wise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CharBroiled</div><div class="date">2011-02-22, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem as I see it is not anything about balacne, but just a simple matter:<br />
On almost all servers, Horde has to wait at least 10 minutes for a BG, alliance has instant invites.<br />
<br />
So after waiting those damn 10 to 15 minutes, Horde players just WANT to win this bg to get their daily done etc. Alliance players in general (yes this is my oppinion bases on personal experience on both sides) do NOT care if they win, they can just instant re-queue.<br />
As to why alliance wins alterac more often, I don´t care what arguments anyone brings, this BG is since its creation extremely alliance biased.<br />
<br />
Well if that's actually true (I'd like to see some empirical data across all servers as to average wait time, but I'll assume it's true for now), then that's another balancing issue that needs to be fixed. As I suggested in my original post (which was what Simca was replying to, that you are quoting), a possible solution is to somehow increase the incentive to BG as alliance. Bonus Honor? A &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot; type buff for Alliance only in BGs? Cheaper PvP gear for alliance than horde? Something to attract better pvpers to Alliance, thereby increasing our queue times and reducing yours while simultaneously balancing the win-loss ratio across all servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However i think the match-making is a bad. I really would be interrested in two values: Overall resilience/player and heal-specc-distribution. My theory is that a larger amount of horde players enjoy PVP and join BGs even if they dont need honor. On the other Hand, a lot of alliance players &quot;gear up&quot; with pvp gear, even if they are inferior than most quest-blues. They have a good ilevel, though.<br />
On the other hand i think healer/DD distribution is way off. As alliance player i was in countless healerless warsongs, as horde there were always at least two of them. On the other hand i played a lot of arathi/warsong with 8 healers. It took ages and the healer team lost, usually. Also in the timeframe i've raided (as alliance) all raidhealers usually gone DD when in battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
I think the match making needs to balance out both. The ability to queue as healer would be really nice as well as balance battleground futher. Also an even distribution of resilience would be the icing of the cake. <br />
<br />
The downside if this is that in battlegrounds changing speccs must be limited as well as prolong queues futher for high resilience horde players. <br />
<br />
But i have no data to proove my suspicions. If you already run such a detailed analysis, please think about including resilience and specc distribution. :)<br />
<br />
Now for a entirely different topic:<br />
On the other hand blizzard could VERY easy cut queue times down to zero and balance PVP regardless of faction. Just allow horde vs horde. Its simple just change the models of the races clientside. For example the big, ugly tauren on the other team could have the model of a gnome. There are a handfull of items which are faction-depend that could give away the &quot;real&quot; faction as well as some of the racials. <br />
Yes it would screw up some lore if you look closely (armory names, some items, racials) but it would fix any faction balance issues on all servers. As well as close any resilence gaps and healer distribution. Lots of games reskin for PVP (showing the enemy always as terrorists for example)<br />
If a gm asks me if i want a dwarf have 5% more pet damage (because he is really an orc) or wait 40 minutes for a battle ground invite i very much know what i would pick.</div></div><hr />

Graphs should represent the ratio visually without knowing the numbers, but when I look at theese I see, that the horde won 2-4 times more BGs, which isn't really the case.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unkn0wnerr0r</div><div class="date">2011-02-22, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those generalizations are also quite a bit off. Alliance, as a matter of fact has quite a few of the best pvpers in the world on their side. Namely, people like Reckful, Billian, Brewkz, and not to mention the best pvp guild in the world, formerly known as We Met on E Harmony (which is composed entirely of multi-season glads), from Mal'ganis, which used to be horde and faction changed specifically because of extreme faction imbalance, just for example.<br />
<br />
In fact many of the best pvpers went alliance in WOTLK specifically because of the Every Man for Himself racial.<br />
<br />
Also, horde guilds indisputably dominate pve. There are far more horde guilds in the top 100 than alliance, hell there's even a significant number of more horde guilds going in to the top 1000 and above.<br />
<br />
I just don't follow WoW pve anymore. While my account is still active (ends this month) I only pvp. Everyone from my guild has switched to rift and canceled. <br />
<br />
Someone above mentioned that horde is better in pve too, so I was wrong on that. What I see in pvp though is that horde simply has a clue what they are doing. <br />
<br />
Take Tol Barad, probably the worst designed pvp concept ever. The horde on my server will hold it for days at a time. You can say &quot;well, it's easier to hold it&quot;. Yet when the alliance wins, we take it right back. I'm not talking a day later. I'm talking about the very next time, we take it. They hold it once every few days. You can't say that's simply because of map design, if that were true then they would hold it for days. They outnumber us on the server, so you can't say it's because the horde has some advantage that way.<br />
<br />
As for the racial argument, the grass is always greener on the other side. Each side has racials the other wishes they had. You want arcane torrent, I would love to have every man for himself. Hell I would settle with the dwarven racial to be honest. I would gladly take even the dwarf racial. Racials aren't going to win or lose a bg for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the choice of scale was a good one because the data actually DOES show a wide discrepancy, but people would be fooled by a visually small gap. I said this in a previous post but I'll say it again, assuming my statistics-skills haven't completely abandoned me... I recall that a margin of 3% is considered statistically significant for a sample size of about 1600. I get the feeling that the sample size here was at least that. In the last year's data alone, the overall advantage for horde-alliance is about 8.5%... almost 3-times the necessary value to become significant. It means there's an issue, and it needs to be adjusted. And if that's not compelling enough for you, before this past year, the difference was only about .6%... it jumped up about 8% in a year and I have no reason to think it's stopped widening.<br />
<br />
Actually that last statement is not true. Much changed since Cataclysm came out. For all I know, the average horde-advantage was much higher (or lower) up until December, when Cataclysm launched. It might have been, say 25%, but the Cata changes have been a retarding force and actually pushed it down in the last few months. I have no idea, because I don't have the proper data.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'd like to see Blizz talking about it a little more. Giving us THEIR statistics, etc.</div></div><hr />

I mean if i was horde and did pvp i wouldn't want to &quot;lose fast guys&quot; after waiting 20 minutes in queue and then queue for another 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Alliance have instant queue and even by losing they get around 40-60 honor or even more in bigger battlegrounds , so the feeling of not caring sets in fast.<br />
<br />
Going by this i think that if ally lost fast every battleground they enter , they would get a lot more honor at the end of the day than the horde who wins most of the time. Or maybe they already do.</div></div><hr />

I kind of have to agree with Yasuo here, gear and team makeup makes a MUCH bigger difference for BGs than racials.<br />
As it is all we can do is speculate and formulate ideas on personal experiences as to why horde has more wins than alliance. Getting some extra data like average resilience per player per battleground per faction or healer to dps to tank ratio per bg would be nice.</div></div><hr />

Yeah they're completely misleading. Pie charts would have been a good option but a bar graph could work If they made it correctly. By looking at these you think some are twice as many more wins or more when in reality it's only 10% or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, I'd be very interested to see this data updated more frequently... maybe month by month for a large sample population. I'm interested to see how Cataclysm has affected things overall. However, I don't advocate changing the Cata-specific BG maps to favor Alliance such that the win-loss ratios approach equal, if people are considering that. Each BG individually should be close to 50-50 (which necessarily brings the total average close to 50-50), because some people just like AV or some people just like Tol Barad, etc. The goal should be balance on the large and small scales.</div></div><hr />

A very specific representation of data like that is fine, and I really do like the more specific graphs as they are more in-depth, but I wouldn't use that scale as the only representation on the front page because it can be deceiving to some people, e.g. the same people that saw the business slate on MMO Champion and claimed that it was 100% concrete without understanding that it was interesting but dubious at best. What I'm worried about putting up with is not the people that understand the graph, it's the people that don't. <br />
<br />
Putting a 0-100% graph in the post to help measure the scale of the difference in winnings wouldn't have hurt is all I'm trying to say. And I can certainly agree with you on that last point, more data from the company itself would help to clear up some of these potential misunderstandings. Expecting them to compile and make public the winnings of one faction over another without hearing complaints of the losing faction is very unlikely, so pleasing everyone is impossible.</div></div><hr />

I have to whole-heartedly second this. MMO-Champion is known for excellent information. Even if this graph is copy-pasted, it should be obvious that it was a very poor choice of scale. Graphs are meant to be understood at a glance. That is why they are pictorial versus textual. A 0-100% scale would have better made the point that in most cases, BG win loss parity is close.</div></div><hr />

Son, you are using words that you have no idea of the meaning of. Statistically significant doesn't mean that &quot;it's an issue&quot; - it means that the difference is larger than the possible error. If you tossed a coin 10 times and it ended up heads 6 times, then the 60% figure would be very troubling but not statistically significant because you've only had 10 pieces of data. If you tossed it a million times and got that it turned up head 50.01%, then it's not very worrying, but statistically significant. Statistically significant just means &quot;this is actually happening&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />

I suggest that if you're going to produce your own charts internally, you get somebody to read Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (google it; I'd link but apparently I've not posted enough times already), otherwise every time you post something like this you'll mislead a whole bunch of people and the whole thread will erupt into flames completely unnecessarily.</div></div><hr />

The horde on my server will hold it for days at a time. You can say &quot;well, it's easier to hold it&quot;. Yet when the alliance wins, we take it right back. I'm not talking a day later. I'm talking about the very next time, we take it. They hold it once every few days. You can't say that's simply because of map design, if that were true then they would hold it for days. They outnumber us on the server, so you can't say it's because the horde has some advantage that way.<br />
<br />
You cannot make any sensible arguement about Horde vs. Alliance based on a single server. The servers are mostly unbalanced, because players have a tendancy to transfer away to a server where their faction are top. On my server Alliance dominate TB, this doesn't suddenly mean that Alliance are better than Horde at PvP though, it means that the Alliance on my server are stronger than the Horde. Maybe they have individuals that are organised into giving out tactics for TB, they certainly seem more unified than the Horde. Another problem is that once you start losing you go into a spiral of decline. You expect to lose, so people don't put in the efford and you do lose.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also on the whole &quot;You don't know statistics, for 5000 results a ratio of 44:56 is expected&quot; arguement that someone else was making. Statistics says as N-&gt;Infinity, the ratio will approach 50:50 if it is perfectly balanced. So while it is to be expected to have some statistical error, there is actually good evidence that Horde are ~4% better at PvP than Alliance. Personally I don't see this as a problem, and is probably due to all the QQ the Alliance make about being poor at PvP. You're literally making it worse for yourself by encouraging transfers of dedicated PvP players to the Horde faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very true.<br />
<br />
Another thing to remember, for the folks writing in that &quot;they lose more often than the graph shows&quot; is that this graph accounts for all battlegroups, therefore if Horde consistently wins Arathi Basin on your battlegroup, but Alliance constantly wins it on mine (oh, how I wish) then they would balance each other out in the data.<br />
<br />
But, as a general rule, this does hold true to my experience in different battlegroups: if you want to win, roll Horde.</div></div><hr />

You need to label the actual values of your bars. The original bar chart allowed people to read the exact percentages. Your one just makes me approximate. For all the rage people have given, the original graph was easy to read when you actually looked at the y-axis. All the &quot;better&quot; ones don't let me take accurate readings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For people who want to see the graph on a scale from 0-100 (like it should have) and see how the difference is much smaller then on the original graph even tough it is the same numbers. I just took the graph on above, you can do the same from the lower graph if you want. <br />
<br />
Also you have to take into count that armory doesn't know who has faction changed over the last year, who are playing the same characters etc. So those two points bias those graphs.</div></div><hr />

Fact is that the largest pooled data set of WoW PvP shows a significant win difference in favor of Horde. And the difference is slightly larger than I think a games developer is willing to live with. The problem is ofc that one reason might be the fact that horde is considered more PvP for many realms and hence a positive selection of players rather than racials and BG design (scratches head).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, 0 - 60% would be best case scenario, but frankly the ones on the front page at the moment really just look terrible. They're very misleading, and the initial response of just about everyone is &quot;Holy shit, that's a massive imbalance&quot;. You wouldn't NEED to have the disclaimer &quot;read the values&quot; if the bars were displayed in a good manner. How many people who just read this site for the news are going to now complain about this?<br />
<br />
Sure, it's their own stupid fault for not being able to read a graph, but I'd be tempted to say some of the blame definitely falls on the original graphs - they could have been made alot better, and it just makes whoever made them look like a real amateur at both graphs and Excel. Don't take that as an insult, it's just how it comes across to those who look at it.<br />
<br />
Putting min/max values on a very close % makes the gap look exceptionally larger than it actually is, and that's why a 0-100% graph still gives a better overall picture of the win % in BGs, rather than some bars with a gigantic visual difference between them - even if the numbers themselves are correct.<br />
<br />
It's good that the compilation of data has been done and it's very interesting, don't get me wrong, it's just poorly presented. That's all people are really saying. For a news site that thousands of people visit daily, it's not great form, at least in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
