Battlefield: Barrens and Path of the Last Emperor<br />
What about the quest leading up to the Battlefield barrens that offer the 502 boots?<br />
Hi there. The quest, 'Path of the Last Emperor' will not be going away when patch 5.4 goes live. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266370-battlefield-barrens-ending-soon/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9661246250?page=8#149))<br />

Patch 5.4 Resto Shaman Concerns<br />
So first off, yes, these changes are indeed being made as measures to help with the input lag problem. We obviously recognize that they're pretty big changes and we're going to have to do some additional tuning as a result (and that goes for everyone effected, not just Shaman).<br />
<br />
Looking at some of the Shaman-specific concerns we've seen come up:<br />
<br />
Earthliving Weapon: We recognize that the changes mean less opportunity for Earthliving to proc, but we're not sure it's overall a big deal. Given Earthliving's duration and the fact that the new, &quot;smart&quot; Healing Rain will still be hitting several targets (just not all at once), we still expect that most people standing in a Healing Rain will still wind up with Earthliving active. If there is a negative impact, we don't expect it to be a big one. It is something we'll keep an eye on, though.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Vigor: This we consider to be a good deal more important, as keeping Vigor active on as many targets as possible is one of Resto's strengths (and feels good as part of their overall kit). Due to the ramp-up time, we feel that having Vigor fall off is a much bigger setback than Earthliving. We haven't made a final call on exactly what we'll do here yet; one idea we've discussed is extending Ancestral Vigor's duration, but that could easily change as we continue tuning.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Guidance/Ascendance: We're not sure there's actually a problem here. Currently, past 6 targets, Healing Rain's actual healing output is reduced per player it affects. The end result is that roughly the same amount of raw healing is going out if it only hits 6 players as it would if it were hitting 25. In fact, in many cases, it could actually be more. If even one of those 25 players were already at full (say they've got a bunch of absorbs on them, or used something like Divine Shield or Dark Bargain), that amount that previously would have just been overhealing will instead be allocated to someone else that actually needs it.<br />
<br />
Again, we recognize that these changes are going to require some extra tuning, so we'll be keeping a close eye on how things shake out in continued testing.

Patch 5.4 Windwalker Feedback<br />
We’re definitely getting very, very different results from you guys in our own testing. For clarity, I’m not just talking about simulations – we’re getting much higher performance, in tier 16 gear, in actual playtesting on the 5.4 PTR client. We’ve even gone so far as to make duplicates of several of your characters just to be certain we’re testing under the same exact conditions.<br />
<br />
This leads us to believe one of two things:<br />
<br />
There’s some sort of bug we haven’t caught yet that’s causing a massive DPS increase somewhere unexpected (which is possible, and we’re investigating, but haven’t found anything to suggest that’s the case), or We’re doing something that the community isn’t, which could possibly be due to inaccurate simulations (which in turn lead to incomplete testing of alternative builds or rotations)<br />
One trend in particular that we’ve noticed is that PTR Windwalkers are placing far more emphasis on Haste than we are. There’s a few minor rotational and talent differences as well when we compare our parses to yours (most of which come from the lower haste), but the biggest difference by far seems to be in how we’re prioritizing secondary stats.<br />
<br />
Again, these are results we’re able to replicate in the same test environment you guys have, using the same gear, with the same buffs/debuffs and so forth.<br />
<br />
We're not comparing 5.4 Windwalker to 5.3 Windwalker, we're comparing 5.4 Windwalker to 5.4 everyone else. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266987-54-ww-feedback-and-discussion-thread-pt2/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9664206530?page=11#202))<br />

The bit about hardcore players not always caring about the long term interests of the game is spot on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368399754356486144))<br />
But it's not the players' job to make a good game. It's the devs' job. So not sure you can blame even HC players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368400117880983554))<br />

The screenshot with four class specs and a tinker class is fake. We can't confirm/deny every rumor but this one is just a clever fake. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366651530633428993))<br />
Thanks for clarifying that. Is the Tinker a class that you feel would fit into WoW? I'd love to see it.<br />

I know you like good args., but it's hard to know what counts. You do ignore some good args. for reasons you can't say in pub.<br />
Sure. And sometimes we agree with an argument and still won't make a change for other reasons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366277456283435010))<br />
We aren't going to answer &quot;What can I do to make an argument so good that you will 100% make a change?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366277658117541889))<br />
And also part of what you're seeing is just the impossibility for us to publicly address every argument or even every popular one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366277929061191680))<br />
<br />
Any chance you'll ever release a copy of your internal sim (if you have it) to give us a tool to bypass those problems?<br />
No. Everyone would invest too much energy trying to prove our tool wrong. It's how these things go. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364956234111127553))<br />

Ola, Mr. Street. just a thought; do you JUST work on WoW? if so, anything else at Blizzard you'd like a crack at?<br />

The way he phrased it, not likely. He said he lets them bitch, why would a dev bitch at him? He also said it would be unfair to not let them considering he joined them. If he joined a dev only guild it wouldn't matter. He'd also just say that. Until he releases his armory I'm not buying it. He spends all day at work I think the last thing he wants to do when he comes home is play. He probably spends time with his family and his sea oriented hobbies. Plus he doesn't just work a 9-5 job, he's constantly doing interviews and traveling. I don't know many guilds that would put up with someone that busy.</div></div><hr />

He spends all day at work I think the last thing he wants to do when he comes home is play. He probably spends time with his family and his sea oriented hobbies. Plus he doesn't just work a 9-5 job, he's constantly doing interviews and traveling. I don't know many guilds that would put up with someone that busy.<br />
<br />
Couple of things: It's probably people he's friends with and the ones that know don't say anything at all to the ones that don't know on pain of banishment forever. And if it was my guild, Greg Street would be welcome to come and go as he pleased. Bad form to outright call him a liar by the way. It tends to make you look small.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps, but he also tweeted about Demon Hunters, months ago:<br />

You've said WoW cannot support an infinite number of classes.With DK and now Monks added will we ever see a Demon Hunter class<br />
Is there enough design space there not occupied by DK, warlock, hunter, warrior?<br />

Do you think I care if you think I'm small? Calling someone who lies a liar doesn't make me small. I don't believe him, deal with it.

PVP balance is a pain, not only do you have to balance classes, but you also have to make sure burst isn´t too high, healing is meaningful yet not so strong that matches last forever, but also, you have to make sure a nearly dead player can be finished off..</div></div><hr />

You can be 13/13H by now doing 8 hours a week or something. Also &quot;heroic 25m&quot; doesn't even equate to that, he could be an 11/13 or something guild, that's easily doable on an 8 hour raid week schedule. There are tons of heroic 25m guilds at various progress level and time/commitment levels. Yes the numbers have thinned in MOP due to 10m and other issues, but they still exist.</div></div><hr />

Let me guess to you only people who live on hotpockets in their mother's basement are the only ones who do heroic raiding? If anything I noticed people who tend to do Heroic content actually are 20-30 year old young professionals that range from accountants to auditors to lawyers in training to young physicians to business manager (you get my point). I know personally I average about 45 hours a week (not including time I have to go into work at 3 AM because something bad happens) and I have more than enough time to raid 12 hours a week and currently I am 11/13 HM (should be 13/13 HM by this point but our guild has been on Hiatus for the past 10 weeks due to real life issues with my guild members). I am a bit surprised you think that only &quot;no lifers&quot; have the time to do heroic content. Yet I guess some people just have better time management skills than others...</div></div><hr />

link the quote where he messed up about blanket silences. But that still doesn´t mean he doesn´t play. If he messed up something after working 50hrs per week on the game, playing the game for a few hours at night isn´t going to teach him that. I know he played a warrior tank in Vanilla and said he was playing mostly unholy DK this expansion.. but not sure to what extent that is his new main or whatever.<br />
<br />
In any event, the guy creates the rotations and is in very early on the boss fight mechanisms and devotes his entire workday to the game... Not to mention probably has the highest end computer possible to play on.. But he was a raider in vanilla, my guess is he isn´t doing pet battles or summoning his cooking student every day either.<br />
<br />
And I agree, calling someone a liar based on nothing is pretty small.</div></div><hr />

i think he called you small because youre jumping down someones throat over something so small. why would gc give you his armory, so people can roll onto his realm and constantly spam him with shit like WHY IS MY CLASS NOT BALANCED???? honestly we don't even know how many hours he works or how many hours he raids.<br />
<br />
and on the subject of knowing classes i think you forget greg is one guy and there are what, 34 specs? there are people who have played one class/spec for years on end and i doubt they know every single tiny thing about that spec. and this guy has to balance all 34 of them at the same time with some other people.<br />
<br />
i think people give gc more credit than he's worth. he's not a one man army and he can't balance every spec around both pve and pvp to make your favorite class run with the pack</div></div><hr />

don't get me wrong though gc can be incompetent at times but in reality this is all part of the design philosophy of mmos in general and wow is not the first mmo to have a lead developer sometimes believe he is right when he could be wrong.<br />

Well it is still buffed compared to live HR (40% increase from live even with the nerf, also the healing nerf wasn't anything to do with lag, it was purely based on HR efficiency in general), they are targeting persistent ground heals aswell as CD's which destroy the combat logging, holy priests HW: Sanctuary and a monks SCK have also been affected by this, probably other things to come as they cut down combat log bloat.</div></div><hr />

On Malkorok 25 man testing RShams with Healing rain were bursting to over 1 million HPS during the stacked phase. Obviously this is an extreme example, but they were pretty overpowered in a stacked situation. Then again, they were relatively weak otherwise for a lot of this xpac, but for stacked fights there will be little reason to bring another class before this nerf happened.</div></div><hr />

I play. I have played for a significant amount of time. I have played every class but priest to high level (85+).<br />
<br />
I still don't know all the classes that have blanket silences. There are classes that I play that I leveled to 85 through questing and 5 mans, and I still don't know the names of half their abilities. There are times I don't even know the names of the abilities I'm ACTIVELY using without a reminder, because I look up my rotations once or twice on Noxxic or Elitist Jerks, and my power names thereafter are irrelevant and slip my mind. A couple weeks after I start playing, my rotation is &quot;1, 2, 3, 2, G, F on cooldown, 1, 3....&quot;. Forget knowing anything about abilities I DON'T actively use. Hell, I didn't remember my monk had a stun until the Enlightenment quest person said &quot;Use Paralysis&quot; and I was like &quot;HUH?&quot;. And then I never bothered to read the tooltip, so my son had to remind me it could be used at range. <br />
<br />
I've raided heroics, though not in MoP. Not knowing the names assigned to my abilities has never prevented me from doing excellent DPS or being a great healer (though oddly, I tend to have a much easier time remembering healing and tanking ability names. Probably because those roles are significantly less rotational and much more reactionary).</div></div><hr />

You mean my 3 seconds AMZ says hi, right?<br />
Yeah nah, still going with purgatory.<br />
<br />
3 seconds is a god damn joke, and utter bullocks compared to what other classes have.<br />
And that is the general complaint the dk`s have atm, no utility, nor the ability to soak various things like every other class do.<br />
the buff(i would not even call it a buff) to AMZ is not going to cut it.<br />
I am not going to focus on timing my AMZ perfectly instead of focusing on my dps.<br />
<br />
5-6 seconds AMZ, and i would be a happy man, but 3 seconds is simply a joke.<br />
There is other classes who can get have a dk`s buffs(and still have more things to contribute with) <br />
There is more than enough classes to have CR so in most cases dk`s dont even have to use that.<br />
What else do dk`s have that is benefitting to a raid group? Nothing, you could argue that grip is somewhat a utility, but you cant even use that on over half of the bosses in ToT.</div></div><hr />
