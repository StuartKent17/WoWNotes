Blue Posts<br />
CM Communication<br />
It's more that a lot of the well thought out stuff aren't quick and easy posts to make in response to, and they may not be allowed to even say anything.<br />
<br />
If somebody makes a post about concerns for the future of PvP in Legion for example, somebody like Neth is almost assuredly under a NDA and can't actually say anything without approval from somebody else at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
As to other things, a lot of the times comments would boil down to &quot;Yeah I read it, and told the developers about it&quot; to which people would probably still be upset that they didn't go more into it. Keep in mind Neth is a CM and can only really pass information onto the dev team, which I imagine she already is just without telling us about it. Blizzard has never really been in the habit of making posts just to indicate that they read a thread.<br />
<br />
As for the comment in the OP, notice how no real information has been given about the game itself. It was a pretty &quot;safe&quot; comment to make, relatively speaking.<br />
We've actually said things like this many times before. <br />
<br />
We often leave the &quot;well thought out&quot; posts alone not because we aren't aware of them but they often end up in our internal reports and we don't want the thread to get derailed just because one of us shows up. <br />
<br />
Posting or not posting isn't a hard science. We have to make calls on things all of the time. The larger 'well thought out' posts aren't going to get short quick answers either. We could do that but then we get &quot;you don't understand&quot; or people assume our involvement means we either agree or are going to make something happen &quot;soon&quot; based on their post. Design is both a fast and slow process. We do what we can to keep on top of the thoughts and ideas of the community and our development teams do too. They read and are aware of far more than you realize. But again, sometimes people take our responding to something as a promise to take action based on what they said. We'd rather wait to respond when there is a response worth sharing.<br />
<br />
Again, it's not a cut and dry thing as much as people think it is. People are complex. They want different things. They interpret words and tone in text differently based on their personal state of mind, wants or desires.<br />
<br />
I think many times people just want to feel acknowledged, especially when they put a lot of thought into something many stand behind. But it's a big community and I'm sure challenging, to say the least.<br />
<br />
Some people are OK with just having their thoughts acknowledged. Others aren't unless the &quot;I read this&quot; is followed up by &quot;and we did/are doing something&quot;. Some people would rather us say nothing than post as I am now unless there is a hard answer to something. Others like just knowing we're here. <br />
<br />
I would much rather be visible (when I can be) in little ways than be invisible for long streaks of time– though I often need to be since my job is much larger than posting here. I do miss getting to speak with you all more often, but I'm doing a lot of behind the scenes work that (hopefully) results in you getting information too as well as relaying information to the developers. There's a lot of planning, excel sheets, project tracking, meetings, writing, etc. that happens on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
You know what might go a long way to ease the tensions and nerves of the posters with good threads (or any threads, really)? A check box on the Blue Poster's version of the forum where they can indicate the thread was read by them without typing out a reply. Anybody who jumps onto the thread would see the flag at the top of the original post (Oh, a blue saw this!) and know that they weren't ignored or forgotten. You could even set it to auto-populate the flag when you click the link if you were so inclined.<br />
<br />
Granted, I'm sure you read most, if not all posts over time, but this would be attract a more psychological response from others rather than them being left to assume and/or think the worst.<br />
The only problem with the &quot;this has been read by a blue&quot; flags would be that people would say, &quot;This was read by a blue but they didn't say anything! No response! When do we get a response?&quot; etc. <br />
<br />
Sometimes we &quot;blue&quot; things by responding so people know we were there, but again, that has it's own issues. There's no &quot;perfect&quot; system, but we will keep doing what we can.

? about 6.2.3. Baleful: created between 655 - 695, increments of 5. No more upgrade token, or what will it do?<br />
It will work the same way it does currently, and set the item's level to 695. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/657678218959327232))<br />
<br />
The Wrath Timewalking Plate Item Gauntlets of the Kraken is suppose to have 286 Stam,it says 274 Stam for level 100 ilvl 675 stat budget. Please check into this to verify this is indeed a number error. #TY<br />
This will be fixed in 6.2.3, thanks for the bug report! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/657678548858109952))<br />

This Month in WoW - November 2015<br />
It’s a big month! A little gathering called BlizzCon will pack November to the brim with World of Warcraft revelations, announcements, videos to watch, new goodies to acquire, and the pinnacle of WoW esports. You’re not going to want to miss November!<br />
<br />
In-Game Events<br />
<br />
Day of the Dead [November 1-3]<br />
Can you feel it? The spirit world draws close during the Day of the Dead. This is why we decorate the graves of our dearly departed with flowers and candles and offerings: to welcome them back, even if only for a time.<br />
<br />
Purchase some Orange Marigolds from Chapman and use them to see the otherwise invisible spirits waiting in graveyards. Bake (or buy) some Bread of the Dead and give it to a Cheerful Spirit to kick off the Grateful Dead quest and unlock a new pet, the Macabre Marrionette – which you can only get during this event.<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire Returns [November 1-7]<br />
The wondrous and mystical Darkmoon Faire returns to Azeroth on November 1, and if you haven’t completed all of Silas Darkmoon’s new Darkmoon Races, now’s the time! Test your speed and agility on a variety of racing mounts as you dodge electrifying obstacles and zip all over Darkmoon Island for rewards and achievements. You may also want to take a few moments to be a kid again by going for a ride on the new Darkmoon Seesaw.<br />
<br />
The faire continues to be one of the best ways to acquire heirloom gear, and don’t forget all of the toys, mounts, and pets that can only be gotten here. Get in that cannon!<br />
<br />
WoW’s 11th Anniversary [November 23]<br />
The World of Warcraft Anniversary celebrates Azeroth's heroes dedication to protecting and preserving their world. Whether you are an honorable Tauren, a brawny Orc, a crafty Gnome, or a resourceful Human, we appreciate your continued support! We hope to see you around for many years to come!<br />
<br />
Pilgrim’s Bounty [November 23-30]<br />
Even during hard times, the Pilgrim’s Bounty celebration emerges across the lands of Azeroth, bringing with it the opportunity to reflect and give thanks for the nourishment the land has provided. This season is the perfect occasion to brush up on your cooking skills while sharing in a veritable cornucopia of delicious offerings found on the communal dining tables located outside capital cities. There’s also no better time to go on a wild turkey hunt, or, should wild turkeys prove too elusive, transform friend and foe into tasty turkey targets.<br />
<br />
It's a time for reflecting on your journeys and good fortune and sharing plentiful food and stories with friends. You can partake in wonderful Pilgrim's Bounty feasts near major towns by sitting at a Bountiful Table and enjoying the food!<br />

Last Month In WoW<br />
Among the many interesting happenings in October, we couldn’t help but take special notice of the annual Running of the Gnomes (http://gnomerun2k15.tumblr.com/). Event organizer Dravvie (http://twitter.com/Dravvie) tells us that over 2400 people gathered on the Scarlet Crusade (NA) realm, created new Gnome characters, and then ran from Gnomeregan to Booty Bay. From there, they all went on to Orgrimmar. Check out these pictures of the event:<br />
<br />

<br />
Along the way, over $3,400 was raised for the Cleveland Clinic’s Cancer Program (http://my.clevelandclinic.org/landing-pages/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-awareness). That’s impressive! Our thanks go out to everyone who sent in a heads up about it.<br />

That Illidan book art is hideous.<br />
<br />
Again, why? The artstyle looks like a blend of realism and a more &quot;story-book&quot; style painted look. What's wrong with it?<br />
<br />
I see all these people just posting negative stuff no matter how trivial. Your critiques are meaningless and hollow without reasoning.<br />

I think the Gnome run is pretty interesting. Community news is still valid news. They'll have more to talk about next week.</div></div><hr />

The orc ones look like promo stills, while that looks like a screenshot from the middle of an action scene.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masternewt</div><div class="date">2015-10-31, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Orcs just look wrong. The eyes are completely human, you can always tell it;s a human in a mask. Check Lord of the Ring orcs, their eyes have no white, are totally yellow, or have the white but are red in the middle. Something, that makes them less human and just more like a fantasy creature. These orcs i see for Warcraft look like they belong in a musical about a land far far away.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they could've done better, because to me it looks like something a cosplayer would make for Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nibu</div><div class="date">2015-10-31, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are people smoking?<br />
<br />
Those stills look AMAZING, far better and so human and not CGI-like. The orcs look sympathetic and that will appeal to a wider audience. It captures their humanity.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harbour</div><div class="date">2015-10-31, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People are just contradicting themselves. Do you want CGI to look realistic or you want Orcs to have nothing common with the human? I'll explain. Motion-capture technology is the thing that allows to copy the emotions and facial structure of actor and translate them on to the creature (with changes to certain extend), thus making them realistic and essential.<br />
So &quot;Good motion-capture&quot; is the motion capture that make us believe that creature is as realistic as human actor and his emotions are as realistic as actor's emotions. <br />
In other words, top-quality CGI implies that Orcs's emotions will be human actor's like emotions. There are no unique &quot;orc&quot; emotions that humans dont have. All humanoid-like living creatures have the similar facial muscles and mimic. So its fine that Durotan has the same human-like expression. If he hadn't, he would be absolutely unrealistic or cardboard.<br />
So make up you mind at first, and only then start to spread the hate.</div></div><hr />

On a side note, it's also incredible how people can keep complaining and complaining and complaining and complaining (and complaining!) about the amount and degree of CM's communication. For &quot;insert-your-religious'-most-iconic-prophet-name-here&quot;, can't you let it go already? Man, some people not only love drama, they have a full time relationship with it, affaire included. I do have some spare time, I'm currently unemployed, but still I find it hard to think people has SO MUCH time that they find nothing better to do than continue complaining about the same topic for more than two months (and I'm pretty sure it goes longer than that).</div></div><hr />

1) hahaha it is not a human in a mask it is full CG Motion capture. Funny how everyone was saying the CG wouldn't be realistic enough and here you go confusing it for a man in a mask! I'd say that is a win for convincing lifelike CGI<br />
2) good lord have you looked at an orc ever in warcraft, like at least once? this isn't lord of the rings<br />

They may not be LotR orcs, but there's no reason for the movie to divert from how warcraft orcs have been portrayed in game, comics and cinematics. They simply aren't as human looking (stature/facials) as the stills show them. But well, at least it fits with the artifical looking armor.</div></div><hr />

Please, do explain how they're stupid reasons or shut the hell up and keep riding everything Blizzard does. They're legitimate reasons that I couldn't care less for this movie.<br />
<br />
1. Live action looks awful for this film to some of us, just looks plain bad. Their cinematics are great, can understand why they couldn't do that but it's a reason why I'm not into the film.<br />
2. Why would I be excited for a movie centered around some Orcs when I'm so sick of them?<br />
3. Metzen is obsessed with orcs, this is bound to have some awful writing.<br />

Okay, sorry about that one if I was wrong then. I read on the wow forums that Metzen was involved with the movie, haven't looked up anything else on it because I really don't care for it. That makes it a bit better, but still not tempting to me. But thank god he's not involved.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard and Warcraft has never displayed a proper ORC - In MY opinion. Ever since the first time I saw orcs in World of Warcraft, I've disliked their looks. But I've always respected the way Blizzard did it, I personally dont agree but I respect it. Respect peoples art and the way they do it, its subjective and there will NEVER be a right way to do &quot;art&quot;.

3. You must've not seen the blizzcon 2014 panel haven't you? The movie is going to be 50 percent human and 50 percent orc on it (aka both alliance and horde). That means we're going to see the rise of the horde as well as the human preparing for war! The movie's gonna end with Stormwind burning and the alliance on the run to lorderon. And if duncan said &quot;If the movie's good.....i will most likely make a sequal out of it (aka WC2)&quot;.<br />

If you call the orcs here uncanny compare to Gollum from LoTR 10 years ago, than it's something wrong with your eyes.</div></div><hr />

Orcs aren't real. So how should they look? Everyone will have their own interpretation of them just as everyone has their own version of what an elf is.

No one interpretation is right because they're all fake. How a fake species is depicted and whether or not you like it is no different than art.

I think it's different for Tolkien's stuff; yes, it was nerdy, but it was generally well-known (or at least, recognised) by the general public prior to the movies. I think WoW's got a different sort of image problem. Still, I'm happy to be proved wrong.</div></div><hr />

They are about the same in that regard, WoW is more modern so it should draw enough outsider viewers.<br />

<br />
It's not hideous, but it's somewhat dated, the whole &quot;cheap graphic novel colored in washed out Xerox art&quot; look, that was everywhere about 10 years ago. The colors are pretty wonky, too. <br />
<br />
Compared to the Arthas cover, though? Much better. A lot of the novels have crappy covers - the only ones I remember that have memorable covers are The Shattering and the Aspects one. If they're moving away from the generic look a lot of the novels have, it's good, I'm just not a fan of this style - but I'm also not a fan of Anime style art, either, and Blizzard has embraced that with the graphic novels. (Before I get attacked by angry Anime fans, there's nothing wrong with it, I just don't like it. MY opinion, and I don't say it shouldn't exist.) <br />
<br />
If it's an amazing book, the cover doesn't matter. Some of my favorite books had generic or bad covers. Some of them had great ones - in Sci FI and Fantasy, a great cover is part of the genre. But, in the end, it's the words that matter. (Which is why I don't buy Warcraft novels.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've thought about this, since the trailer leaks started coming out, and stills...at first glance, I felt something was &quot;off&quot; with them. I wasn't quite sure of what it was, but I'm getting a better idea of what I feel is wrong - they pushed the realism too far, IMHO. I get that they're the main characters, so they have to be expressive and all, but I think they're too slick now, to &quot;normal&quot; looking, if that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Look at the MoP Cinematic trailer. That look, to me, is perfect. Still cartoony, exaggerated, fits the look we've grown used to. (And...green.) The human fits in, with the big jaw, pumped up muscles. The humans in the movie stills look...human. Not exaggerated caricatures that we're used to. (ie., boring) The movie orcs have human eyes, at the same size as humans, which is unsettling - and too small for the rest of the features. They just look too slick, too produced. <br />
<br />
The movie should have been done Pixar style. It really should. Live action is meaningless in a movie like this, with so much CGI anyway. They HAD a look that was appealing, entertaining, fit the look they've spent a decade establishing, and the movie just looks like it pushed it too far. The humans look dull, uninspiring, props compared to the overworked orcs with massive muscles. Meh. The more I think about it, the more I dislike it. I'll wait for the actual trailer to make any kind of judgement, but I figured out why I don't like what I've seen so far.<br />
<br />
In movie terms, this is too &quot;Howard The Duck&quot;, not so much Lord Of The Rings. WETA did the orcs right in the movies, they made them very much NOT human, and found the right balance of real, and cartoony. Same for the characters, they manipulated the size of the hobbit's eyes and ears, very subtly, so they didn't look like normal sized humans, in over-sized sets. <br />
<br />
I also have this weird vibe from the little released so far, that they're going to cast the humans as bad guys. The &quot;We're just misunderstood creatures who just want a hug&quot; vibe from these stills...meh. Fuck that. I hope I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

You see the problrm with your idea is that your thinking from a fan's perspective.But the movie has to appeal to a much larger audience,ppl who have nevr played warcraft games.And to do that you have gotta make the orcs relatable with their emotions.Also the Orcs must NOT be pure evil here(even though they were in the original WC1).Nobody would want to see a &quot;humans vs Bad orcs&quot; movie,we already had those with LotR.The LotR orcs never had any emotion other than those of evil;they were outright evil and there is no question of morality.The major selling point of Warcraft is that neither side is totally evil and you can cheer on both.<br />
Doing a MoP like cinematic for an entire 2hr movie is unrealistic because of the cost,time and ,again,the appeal of the film.It would just be considered another &quot;nerd&quot; movie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO, the whole head is structured wrong - the brow should be bigger and deeper, it just looks like a guy with an orc mask from the nose down. Eyes should definitely be bigger. <br />
<br />
That's Hollywood at work there, anthropomorphising them to make them more appealing to the general audience. Again - Howard The Duck. Howard was creepy looking in the movie, because he had human eyes. He worked as a cartoon, because he had big googly cartoon eyes, like Donald Duck. But as eyes are crucial to expression, and audiences want familiar, they stuck human eyes on him.<br />

Sorry to repost a huge quote but I agree with this 1000%. This just looks terrible and is so disappointing. Agree about the story too, but pretty soon a Horde apologist will swoop in and tell you &quot;Orcs have always been the good guys!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I think it just feels weird to me because i have not had a chance to see a high def example of them moving and interacting with the world they are supposed to belong in. the clunky looks and movements of WoW have become the accepted norm for me so its a bit of a weird thing to imagine them on the big screen with that as my go-to example of them. the models themselves look great though. If they would stop being so secretive about things and just give us a proper trailer i'm sure i would warm up to it.<br />
Its just too bad they could not have made this sooner. fifteen year old me would have been so hyped for this. I will still watch it of course but i feel like i would have appreciated this most when i was just getting into wow.<br />

It is funny that you don't want a Warcraft movie but you are still here discussing it. Should you not be doing something else other than reading up and commenting on a movie that you never wanted? It should be almost of no concern to you, no?</div></div><hr />
