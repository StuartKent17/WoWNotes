<br />
We couldnt kill XT today :( good to see its fixed now, but we had a bug with FL too: usually we kill it with two towers up ( storm + frost ), but today it had the &quot;tower of life&quot; buff too and his hp was also bigger, as we noticed it the boss was already at 30%, we killed him, and no achievement...<br />
Ignis oneshotted our tank... <br />
<br />
thats funny : <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moryton</div><div class="date">2009-08-06, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We attempted both FL 2T, Razor, XT, Kologarn and Auriaya on 10man.<br />
<br />
Both Kologarn and Auriaya were just as usual.<br />
<br />
Like mentioned above, when doing FL with Frost and Fire, as we had, he also had the tower of life buff. We tried going out, reseting and only do 1 tower(frost) and he still had the Tower of Life buff. <br />
So it was 2 1/2 towers.. ???<br />
<br />
Anyway, Razor...Basically had the amount of adds as you would get from the 25man raid. (no, we didn't survive). <br />
<br />
XT, like mentioned before, had extreme amounts of adds. <br />
<br />
As it seems, anything with a Hard Mode, has half of it activad.... For some strange reason<br />
<br />
We hope that it get's hotfixed soon :P</div></div><hr />

I was expecting a dps buff to 212.3 to bring it in line with it's new 219 ilvl. but they didn't, which is weird because they actually say the weapon damage will get updated<br />
<br />
<br />
My Ancient Pendant of Arathor got the same treatment, everywhere a couple of digits extra.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I recommend doing XT quick as it's really easy to get the [Nerf Scrapbots] achievement, where you kill 20 scrapbots by blowing up bomb bots in 12 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some players don't have all their titles, I for example just have 5 out of around 14 before.<br />
A GM told me, they're working on that issue, so when I read about fixes, I really hoped to get my titles back^^</div></div><hr />

But it's rather silly how these kind of issues always show up after patches.<br />
<br />
And dreadful to think which other encounters could be affected without them immediately noticing.<br />
Onyxia anyone? :P</div></div><hr />

First poster is right. Even if his case is just the scroll bar thing, there are people with bugged titles.<br />
<br />
First screenshot is my char, with the scrollbar &quot;circled&quot;. That's how it should be.<br />

<br />
Second one is my friend's case. He should have lots and lots more titles, but only 2 appear. And no scrollbar.<br />
<br />

<br />
Just an educated guess that when they added the code that converts honor to xp in battlegrounds, they forgot that wintergrasp commendations give you a relatively huge amount of honor (and thus a lot of xp) for a low level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been raiding for a while, so I am used to adds mysteriously moving through the center gate occasionally during the encounter. Its a small annoyance, but nothing more. Last night however, was something completely different.<br />
<br />
Decided to run a Naxx25 PuG as a part of a recruitment campaign. Things were moving along swimmingly until we got to Gothik. The initial pull went smooth and things were fine until about 30 seconds before he teleported. At that point, a couple of DK Cavaliers from the hallway after Gothik came into the dead side of the room. They were in the process of getting that under control when a Vigilant Shade popped into the live side of the room. Immediatley after that another trash group from the hallway pulled into the dead side and took to wiping them and ended the attempt completely. Putting it all down to sh*tty luck, we tried again with the same results, at which time I ticketed a GM, explaining what had happened. It was decided that we would go do the other 2 wings (spider and Abom, plague was already done) while we waited for the GM to get back to us.<br />
<br />
About an hour and a half later, everything else was done and I had not gotten a response from a GM, and we decided to try and cheat it by grouping everyone on the live side and mana draining Gothik during the add phase. It worked like a charm and we downed Gothik and the rest of Naxx without an issue.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the two wipes and then eventually cheating the encounter were quite a bit of fun, but they do need to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So the hardware on the PTR is completely different than EVERY other server? Plus with the programming abstractions they use, I'm sure hardware differences don't really matter too terribly much.<br />
<br />
The amount of players on doesn't affect things like XT spawning more adds or an Alliance AH being available to Horde.<br />
<br />
Copying your Windows folder to another computer is WAY different than PATCHING some software on machines THEY control.<br />
<br />
Even Microsoft can roll out updates more successfully and theirs is on a much higher scale and on a wider variety of computers.<br />
<br />
Learn something about software development before commenting on something you OBVIOUSLY don't know anything about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I figured this one out. Living Bomb does not crit by default. It requires Glyph of Living Bomb. This means that if a fire Mage is stupid enough to not have that glyph, they will almost never proc Hot Streak using a standard rotation. I think the ability for Living Bomb to proc Hot Streak will be moved to the Glyph of Living Bomb so that the core mechanic of Hot Streak is not compromised. I think they overlooked this when they made the first attempt to make this work.</div></div><hr />

Well, yeah. I have had mobs go through the gate before, but I have never seen that trash after him pull during the encounter. I guess they were aggroing through the wall, since they didn't pull when we all just grouped on the live side.</div></div><hr />

I think it has a bit more to do with how in high-population servers Mr. Timothy Jones was inaccessible due to an extreme amount of people trying to buy their new designs than to how much people care about TBC factions.<br />
<br />
I actually enjoyed the change they did with XT, was fun burning bomb bots down and having 1/3 of the raid wipe ' cause our ranged fellas are so used to &quot;lol dps the heart and when the phase is over kill the 2 bomb bots&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I was going to argue, since he assured me he had more titles (like, of Undercity, etc). But I checked his reputation tab, and now I'm so going to kick his ass.<br />

Oh so very true. Working for a website company as an integrations developer i can whole-heartedly tell you that this stuff is just bound to happen. In our company we have a bunch of dev servers / testing servers / UAT servers / Pre-live servers and then obviously our productions servers. We have a dedicated section (QA) to root out all issues before our updates make it to live and also work in a unit test-driven working environment (we build our unit tests before ever coding). STILL, on a large launch we will find a bunch of issues....we have a lot of people up all night on release nights throwing out hotfixes / fixing major issues even AFTER all is said and done. <br />
<br />
Things just happen. With code as massive and intertwined as Wow's code one little change can ruin a lot. If you don't believe me...set up your own server. Just TRY and get even ONE working NEARLY as good as a live server. Look at all the private servers...some of them have dedicated volunteer workforces and STILL have issues 24/ 7. What do you think we pay them for? Just be happy that the product we got is as good as it is ;)</div></div><hr />
