Mailing Heirlooms to Other Realms<br />
Ok so hierlooms(think thats how you spell it)can not be sent to other servers now the idea behinde these is to help people lv new chars faster right so why cant you send these to other realms,seriously blizz most ppl would like to be able to send them to other realms.This is a small issue that would make a massive difference to alot of people<br />
So, in case we can put this topic to rest...<br />
<br />
Regarding the ability to send heirlooms cross-realms, please be aware that it's highly unlikely it'll be implemented during Mists of Pandaria as there're numerous technical hurdles that need to be overcome first in order to happen. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249129-hierlooms-why-not/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6200871344?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
Brawler's Guild Cooldowns<br />
We are happy with the way cooldowns currently work for abilities in the Brawler’s Guild. Most of them should reset by the time the next fight begins (Yes, not all do but most fall into this category). Right now we don’t want to expand what types of content are given the free temporary respec and cooldown resets. Adding these to an element of PvE might lead to a slippery slope.<br />
<br />
Um, most 5+ minute cooldowns as well as all battle rez's reset after a raid boss dies or wipes you, as well as killing a boss clearing sated. Its already in PvE. And frankly for a good reason, sitting around waiting for cooldowns isn't fun nor does it add anything<br />
With short queues, it's understandable that this can be frustrating. As it populates though, you shouldn't really notice it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249172-brawlers-arena-cooldowns/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7415154257?page=1#14))<br />

No Dec 25th Maintenance<br />
Right now there are no plans for maintenance tomorrow. Obviously if something comes up, that could change. If that happens, we'll post something here on the forums.

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Players quick to assume balance drives class %s. After looking at 8 years of data, we don't think it's a major factor. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276753264098295808))<br />
<br />
One of the reasons they have a hard time being objective is that switching costs to another class are very high.<br />
Agree that switching to a new class is tough. Swapping specs is less so and IMO players often overestimate the need to. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277532970259214337))<br />
<br />
You mentioned in the recent pod cast that There are more ret pallies than rogues. Does that mean Rogue buffs or Ret nerfs?<br />
We think kit, fun, visuals, doing something special and flexibility are probably bigger drivers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276753491874156544))<br />
Then what does your data say about the Lock, Mage, War population right now?<br />
None have changed appreciably since MoP launch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276757361706799104))<br />

Hey GC, is the Blood DK Tier 14 4 Piece bonus not supposed to boost blood shield, or is that a bug? Thanks. <br />
It is intended to (in this case, not for every +heal). Should have been fixed in 5.1. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277227896152678400))<br />

You say you want talent options for PvP, yet every Hunter has Silencing Shot, Blink Strike, and Glaive Toss.<br />
Silencing is too good vs. the alternatives. The Glaive Toss problem is that Power Shot isn't reliable enough. Can fix both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276505294341828609))<br />

How you feel about firemages losing there raid spots after recent hotfixes<br />
Haven't seen it happen. Some mages are able to try Arcane and Frost now though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276380349293027328))<br />
<br />
You said &quot;come back in a week and we will see how mages are&quot;, and yes, firemages are bottom :P<br />
Not seeing Fire on bottom. Happy where Fire is so far. Many mages trying Arcane and Frost, skewing results of sites like raidbots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277197109097275393))<br />
10 man normal: 45,366 parses for Fire, 12,702 for Arcane, 9,776 for Frost. 22,478 are the only good mages?<br />
That's size not bias. Bias is Frost jumping 10K or whatever with no buffs. That means the # for Frost before was not accurate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277539288323850240))<br />
<br />
Tweetered you a few days ago, (not nagging but...) please take another look at combustion, it's hardly worth casting anymore.<br />
Off the GCD + free damage... hmmm. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277125066435743744))<br />
<br />
change to onuse trinket CD will allow mages with 2 on use trinkets to have 1 available for every single deep freeze. intended?<br />
Smaller burst every 30s is easier to survive than a larger burst every 60s. Humans have to give up the not-nerfed proc trinket. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276867325993570304))<br />
honestly think mages would be fine if you got rid of the glyph that let them explode their own frost bombs<br />
Yeah, also on the list. Risk might be that Frost Bomb never does damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276868207124553728))<br />
BTW, why does Frost Bomb have special dispel rules, when other class DoTs such as Devouring Plague do not? Hypocrisy.<br />
Having variety in spells isn't the typical definition of hypocrisy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277123460357058560))<br />
<br />
After almost a full weeks raiding do you feel fire mage damage is where it should be or have they been hit a bit too hard?<br />
We're happy with it at the high end. Looking to make sure less geared Fire mages didn't drop too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277531839307075586))<br />
<br />
This week (since the hotfix) fire has twice as many parses than Frost and Arcane combined, how would that skew the results?<br />
Look at Arcane's curve leap skyward. Now considered they were not buffed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277204035352805377))<br />
Your reply implies that min/max moved to Arcane. Those outliers alone don't explain why median numbers for Fire fell so much.<br />
We def nerfed Fire. That was the intent. Just trying to explain that 22nd out of 24 is hyperbole or not reading data well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277225916382449664))<br />
Does this look like hyperbole to you? http://t.co/35U5jM2Hhttp://t.co/x8H5mwTtNotice the sudden dropoff dec 4<br />
Change that chart to just Fire and Frost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277237744282001409))<br />
Why not be transparent and make a reporting site w/ your data? Arguments can actually be solved with fact<br />
Data isn't the problem. Raidbots, World of Logs etc have tons. Analysis is the challenge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277535428477870080))<br />
Do you know what &quot;median&quot; means?<br />
Yes. I also know what sampling bias means. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277239214452649985))<br />
thus ANY change on RaidBots is exaggerated due to sampling bias and not always reflective of expected performance<br />
Yes. It doesn't mean the data are useless. It just means you need to be careful. Raidbots site even states that down below. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277535007994699776))<br />

Arcane received a buff (Mana cost reduction and boost to damage per stack) Made haste&gt;mastery until high iLevel<br />

why did you guys remove cataclysm warlock spell since its a good utility, not OP and on top its a dps loss...just curious<br />
It wasn't actually good utility. Melee just stepped away from it until the effect ended. Maybe useful in PvE, but wasn't the goal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276754295783833601))<br />

with the &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; standing why are warlocks still the only class with health stones? Thanks.<br />

Your solution doesn't allow me to mail an heirloom from char A on server B to char C on server D. It just allows me to buy another copy of the heirloom with a second set of currency on another server. Currency (like JP) which I can't get, because I'm level 1.<br />
<br />
Moving items between servers (and the back-end support tools for dealing with allowing users to do that) is probably more work than you think it is.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I wasn't clear. Once the first copy of the heirloom is bought from vendor A, the only thing required from vendor B is to simply have the achievement, at no cost to buy, or if it needs to cost something, 1c.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if it was you in the past too, but someone mentioned something about vendors for heirlooms also, quite some time ago , not sure if it was exactly like you explained now. Anyway , i also remember around that time a blue post that said something like : heirlooms passed through verdors sounded tacky to them. What they want to do is make them like Titles are now for characters, so maybe not even something that would clutter up your bank or bags but just be there and click whatever you wanted from that list of yours , to wear.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the ability to send heirlooms cross-realms, please be aware that it's highly unlikely it'll be implemented during Mists of Pandaria as there're numerous technical hurdles that need to be overcome first in order to happen.<br />

Most people either just level on another realm without heirlooms, or if they really need to level on another realm for whatever reason, transfer overa char carrying looms.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm glad they haven't wasted dev time on this trivial and almost none-existant problem. I'm probably not alone.<br />

Pretty much this. Those 'technical issues' sound like an excuse, since its extremely vague. They've had since Wrath of the Lich King to fix those 'issues'.<br />
<br />
And then they add Cross-Realm Servers without any problems. And hardly anyone wanted them, and we have no way of turning them off when they become a hinderence to our fun (i.e. farming rares or pets or mining or herbalism...).<br />

Swell. Great. Lovely.<br />

Heirlooms not being for all characters ruins the game how? They are just small perks, like being in a guild for the perks. It's a choice of, &quot;Do I want to earn the heirlooms and level my toon slightly faster?&quot; or &quot;Do I want to do it the normal way?&quot;<br />
<br />
You could also argue it's not fair that other players have friends in the game that allow them to level faster by the help they provide. Blizzard should supply friends too, cross realm of course. We need them for all the alts we are going to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moving items between servers (and the back-end support tools for dealing with allowing users to do that) is probably more work than you think it is.<br />
<br />
Framework already exists, has for a long time, but, they've stated that they want to do something weird and new with heirlooms, devs have stated they dont like doing it via mail. On top of this, lack of heirlooms on new servers keeps you on your low pop server so the server pop doesn't get any lower, so benefit would be minimal.</div></div><hr />

It is that easy. The truth is that Blizzard doesn't want to do it. They can call it &quot;technical issues&quot; but they are still making alot of money with character transfers of heirloom items on same account as it is. So why should they change it ? Money money money. !</div></div><hr />

But don't worry, I've disagreed with many changes. I don't instantly favor everything Blizzard does. However most of the times I do agree with their reasoning.

Frost is cool but too weak for pve -&gt; I understood that most of us get the best fun from playing fire and frost.<br />

Simpler than that. You buy the heirloom, get an achievement, have it automatically sent to the first toon you create on any server. Just like with pets and mounts.</div></div><hr />

hmm. yep right. even better.<br />
new toon, mailbox full of shiny stuff and you just need to get rid of the stuff you dont need &amp; keep the nice ones.<br />
also you dont need to need to visit a npc for re-buying armor you sold by accident. just create another toon on that server. me gusta much ;)</div></div><hr />
