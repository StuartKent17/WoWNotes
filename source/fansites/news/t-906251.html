Capping Mastery Harder in 4.2<br />
We are in the process of trying some different numbers for various talents and mechanics on the PTR, with the goal of making it harder (or impossible) to cap mastery. What we want to avoid is making mastery worthless or causing other undesirable effects.<br />
<br />
If we are successful, we will adjust the other tanks to be relatively balanced with paladins again.<br />
<br />
If we aren't successful, we know what the fall back position is (basically what we have now).<br />
<br />
At this time, we're in the middle of examining this and other changes. Please be reminded that we do read the forums, and appreciate feedback. A dispassionate perspective goes a long way. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/175861/holy-shield-in-42-help-me-understand) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2522164908?page=6#105))<br />
<br />
More changes upcoming on PTRs<br />
There are several changes we are trying, and the current PTR only reflects a fraction of them. Keep in mind that while we have a lot of changes we want to get in to every major patch, we also want to try and get builds on the PTR as frequently as possible so that we can test other things (like Firelands encounters). We tend to grab builds often, not necessarily when every single change is in place.

Ask the Devs<br />
The Q&amp;As are designed so that we answer the top rated questions that the community has. Sometimes though, the questions asked aren't ones we can answer for you directly, but we try to answer what we can. So the choice is either to pretend that those questions don't exist and avoid them (even though they were highly rated) or to give whatever answer we can, even if it's just &quot;We like it. We're thinking about it. We'll get back to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
What we're trying to do is to give you some insight into what the development team is thinking and the processes involved. Sometimes that means giving an answer that explains why we don't want to do something or why something might be difficult to do. This is not putting off the question. It's just our way of trying to explain why we don't have a better answer for you at the time. We're trying to be as transparent as possible, but at the same time, there will always be some gray areas that even we are trying to sort out and we'd rather not mislead or give false hopes if we can avoid it. We'd much rather give what solid answers we can as we can when we can and when we get further along in design, talk about what we are able to do and doing then.<br />
<br />
When we started these Q&amp;As, we knew that disappointing people now and then with answers was something that would happen. But, we feel the benefits of doing these outweigh the negatives by far. We'd rather face the danger rather than run away away.

<br />
Compare a buffs to a class to make their specs actual viable to a nerf that completely guts the use of a spell in PvP yes that makes sense... As it is right now mages need to spam spell steal to even have a shot of getting a useful buff off their opponent. If they don't want us using it in PvP so badly they should just not make it work on player targets. Hopefully they make other ridiculous cooldowns on peoples abilities in 4.2 <br />
<br />
4.2 Patch notes<br />
All dispell abilities now have a 6 second cooldown<br />
All healing abilities place a debuff on their target preventing further healing from that spell for 30 seconds<br />
<br />
Those changes would make just as much sense as the change to spell steal</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Warlock tier looks nice. I wish the headpiece were a little smaller, but it's a minor thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like how Blizz victimizes themselves in their Ask the Devs response. &quot;Well, it's not *our* fault that players ask (and then vote for) questions we can't answer. We're just victims of the system we made up!&quot; How about this. If there's a question that players ask but you don't have (or won't give) a real answer for, simply respond with &quot;We're thinking about it but have no answers at this time.&quot; Then, move on to a better, more relevant question (or at least one that you can give a real answer to) and stop pretending that telling players &quot;We're thinking about it!&quot; is a satisfactory answer to everything. I'd rather at least have some useful answers than maybe one line (example, &quot;chaos orbs will eventually be unbound) and then the rest all &quot;WELL WE'RE THINKING ABOUT MAYBE SOMEDAY DOING SOMETHING BUT THEN AGAIN WE MIGHT NOT&quot; fluff. God, if I tried to pull this kind of stunt at work, I'd be canned. It's really poor quality feedback, and only serves to make players feel like you think they are stupid. Reading a Q&amp;A shouldn't make people feel angry over a lack of substance. It's self-defeating.</div></div><hr />

Go watch the armors in rift and then you can start crying about ugly armor :D<br />

I quite like it BUT how can you say if people don't like it then they don't know what they are talking about? it's PERSONAL choice and these forums need less biggotted views like yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Compare a buffs to a class to make their specs actual viable to a nerf that completely guts the use of a spell in PvP yes that makes sense... As it is right now mages need to spam spell steal to even have a shot of getting a useful buff off their opponent. If they don't want us using it in PvP so badly they should just not make it work on player targets. Hopefully they make other ridiculous cooldowns on peoples abilities in 4.2 <br />
<br />
4.2 Patch notes<br />
All dispell abilities now have a 6 second cooldown<br />
All healing abilities place a debuff on their target preventing further healing from that spell for 30 seconds<br />
<br />
Those changes would make just as much sense as the change to spell steal<br />

poly - ss - ss - ss - ss - ss -repoly- -pyroblast-<br />
<br />
ROFL, who hard casts a Pyroblast in PvP? (nobody, not even Fire Mages)<br />
<br />
Though it doesn't really make much sense... the changes in the top part are entirely PvE changes, which made PvE Mages happy. The spellsteal nerf is entirely for PvP and made PvP Mages upset (though I'll admit, some less informed and dumb PvE Mages are upset about it, but they shouldn't just be because we won't be able to double everyone elses DPS on a gimmick fight).<br />
<br />
While I smiled, the potshots at Mages are starting to become boring. Let's be more creative. <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Btw i only use spellsteal on a few bosses so i really dont care about the nerf on that spell :)<br />
I use it for bosses to help tanks and group so they not only nerf the mage but full groups going for these bosses think about that :P<br />
In pvp its good against some classes, but since im not that good in pvp i hardly ever do that :)</div></div><hr />

I went from a freshly dinged 85 mage with crafted pvp gear wrecking everyone, pvp gear or not, to not being able to kill a dps class in non-pvp gear. Now I'm back up to being able to kill stuff if I play right, which is where it should be. There is just such a large difference between starting gear and top end gear that its hard to balance the damage properly for everyone.</div></div><hr />

If this post isnt bias then i dont know what is , they are trying to balance mage class to other classes and mage's are crying over small nerfs and i bet those crying about spell steal nerf are the mages who Poly &gt; spam Spell Steal , Devour Magic from Felhunter got nerfed to oblivion and its only a offensive dispell while Spell steal offers benefits to dispeller/caster aswell <br />
<br />
<br />
OT: I never thought that i would say this but Warlock T12 set actually looks nice compared to other failures ,lock T12 has best textures out of other T12 (i was expecting some hideous set considering its &quot;fire spiders derp&quot; themed</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has served the game on a silver plate to mages with Cataclysm. With warriors right on their heals, and everyone else left in the gutters.<br />

Warlock set doesn't look bad at all IMHO. Death Knight helm is lol-awful looking.<br />

Daily Blink is great and applies to all classes, not just Mages (although Mages have been the crybaby lately). Way better than the Dark Legacy comics, every time.<br />

I really hope you are trolling because you just compared removing some freaking buffs to getting healed every 30 seconds.. 30 seconds... how many Arcane Blast can you cast in 30 seconds? thanks to Blizzard, the company you hate ever so much, 15. not including your haste. <br />
As a PvP and PvE healer i say F**K you and all mages like you, try taking a mana nerf slap to the face and come back and complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes me laugh when people say Cata has been in constant favor of mages. Sure, when Cata first came out, this was entirely true. All the old WotLK abilities became ridiculous in Cata, and they've slowly been nerfing them back down. I still think there's a few more nerfs needed for mages in PvP to bring them back in line, but it's not as out of hand as it was 4 months ago. In terms of PvE, Mages have been doing well because of multi-dotting. Now with the Arcane buffs, mages are able to do a lot better single target. Frost PvE is still lacking (mostly due to its overwhelming popularity in PvP) but has been getting better. Mages are in a good place altogether. Some of the other classes are better off, but there seems to be an angry mob against the state of mages. We're no better off than Hunters, Warriors, Warlocks, Priests, or Paladins, but if you read the forums at all, you'd think we were wrecking PvE with the push of a single button.</div></div><hr />
