WoW's 10th Anniversary (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/514-wows-10th-anniversary) is now live in the US and EU and will last until January 6th. It has a level 100 version of Molten Core, Southshore vs Tarren Mill battleground, a Molten Corgi and some other nice rewards. This year's Celebration Package (http://www.wowdb.com/items/107224-celebration-package) hasn't turned up in the mail so far, so don't plan on that 10% experience boost.<br />
<br />
Molten Core - 40 Player Raid Finder Difficulty<br />
A special level 100 version of Molten Core is back! You can queue for this 40 player Raid Finder experience if you have an item level of 615 or above. Make sure you have some time available when you start, as this is the full Molten Core raid. Blizzard is working on fixing (https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/535864152451858433) whatever is causing groups to be kicked out of the raid before it is over.<br />
<br />
Rewards include an item level 640 helm, mount (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115484-core-hound-chain), pet (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/87669-hatespark-the-tiny), and special weapon transmog illusion (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118572-flames-of-ragnaros) that isn't consumed on use and works on all non ranged wepaons. The mount and helm are the only guaranteed drops (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/11502-ragnaros?drops-item-subtab=18#related:drops-item;_!), as the pet appears to have a ~10% drop rate and illusion ~3%.<br />
<br />
&lt;span title=&quot;#BlameWatcher&quot;&gt;Watcher has a helpful reminder (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/535611827242012673) to stop by Golemagg's window to see Ragnaros! &lt;/span&gt;<br />

Southshore vs. Tarren Mill Battleground<br />
This 40v40 battleground lasts an hour or until one faction has 10,000 points. It is a limited time event that could return again every year for the anniversary. The more players you kill without dying in the battleground, the higher a temporary rank you have. The ranks are named after the old PvP titles (http://wowpedia.org/Title#History_of_PvP_Honor_System_Titles) and do not have any real reward. The higher your rank, the more points a kill gives. <br />

<br />
Molten Corgi<br />
The Molten Corgi (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/84915-molten-corgi) will arrive in your mail if you log in during this event. This pet has a nice idle animation (http://gfycat.com/CheapOblongFly).<br />

This. People wanted classic back, that's what they're getting. I remember classic. The content wasn't anywhere near as good as people remember it, they're just remembering a time before they were sick of dealing with other players. You think the MoP dailies were a grind? Try doing the AQ war effort, or Dire Maul rep, or simply getting your dungeon set. Except most people didn't do that. Most raids were ~10 geared and educated people carrying 30 players that were just there to fill the roster and add minimal dps, only you didn't have the LFR matchmaker to find them for you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the connection issues were MUCH worse. Enjoy not raiding at all because your guildmaster is having a thunderstorm.</div></div><hr />

Your the one that didn't sadly, if you did you'd have know ss/tm fights lasted days and days, not over in a few minutes and everyone went home and a lot of the time 1 side was outnumbered by the other which lead to corpse camping and graveyard humping, had you not been in nappies during this period, you'd have known that rather than having a good cry like a self entitled tool.<br />

That is definitely Wong, historically it was the other way around. I once saw TM guards chase us all the way back to SS and the spawn more of themselves until the paned all the alliance NPCs as well.</div></div><hr />

The TM guards were basically rabid animals. Once they caught your sent...they would not stop until either you died, or they did. I've had them chase me all the way to Silverpine once.....<br />
<br />
Then I went horde and used them as an advantage...Ahh I still remember playing my BE Protadin, two NE warriors were causing trouble. One was arms, one was fury. Kited them to TM spamming holy shield, had both nearly dead (they weren't the brighest...they stayed IN FRONT OF ME as I backpeddled...) by the time they realized what I was doing. By then it was too late..the TM guards saw them from about a mile away...it was like kicking a fire ant nest after that.<br />
<br />
I'd say I felt sorry for the two...but they were ganking lowbies. They deserved it.</div></div><hr />

Can't get DE on loot, whilst currently it ain't an issue cause most people need the gear, but in the future when heroics become obsolete could at least use some mats from the run but no.<br />
NbG has some issues yes when the loot is not categorized correctly as it now is not, melee dps can roll on spirit trinkets etc and trolls rolling need on everything.<br />
But maybe that issue isn't in the loot system, it's in the community. Maybe it's time to enhance it first.<br />
If you're level 100 and don't know what stats and gear to use, there's a huge huge problem somewhere along the way to level 100.<br />
Guaranteed drop from last boss? What is that.. So now you must need something from the last boss, screw the other bosses, if you're after one item from the first boss you're fucked, but don't worry you get a useless price no matter what from the last boss. And on top of that the system now has the changing loot, so there's about 7 pieces per boss you can obtain which of 6 are total crap for your spec, but they are in the loot table so rngesus if granting you with loot will grant you a useless item 6/7 times that you have no control over if you want it or not, or even to pass it to someone else.<br />
Loot system has been in place for nearly 10 years and worked, the ninjas have been a minority and a sideproduct of human stupidity.<br />
Guess it's time to start supporting the premade system, just no tanks ever there, cause lfd is instant queue.<br />
Guess it's not a problem on any of the 4 tanks i got but what about dps only specs?<br />
<br />
MC is pretty nice, good trash, nearly harder than bosses. There actually a point in them. <br />
Only thing i'm not excited is the amount of time it's going to consume to get the pet and enchant.<br />
It seems pretty much that only one person can get the pet and one the enchant per raid. One run for a good group can take 2-3 hours and well the rest can spend 2-3 hours on the first trash even.<br />
The enchant is not even boa, so basically a person like me who wants it on all of his 11 toons has to spent 17 hours a day for the next month to gain it.<br />
Problem is that you still need to level 10 toons to 100 first which alone takes at least a day per toon. <br />
There isn't a lockout for it so you can spam run it, but as i've done it today 4 times and it's taken around 11 hours to do, i guess xmas holidays or working is not on option in the next 1,5 months.<br />
Or even doing any other WoD content. Thanks Blizzard for making life choices for me.</div></div><hr />

So glad they did. Even 40v40 lagged like crazy during the first clash in the middle of the map, I can't imagine how bad 100v100 would have been!<br />
