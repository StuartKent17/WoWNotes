100,000 More Beta-Test Invites - Wave 2<br />
Yesterday’s 100,000 Annual Pass-holder beta-test invites ran through the night, and we’re still in the process of notifying the invitees by email. Those selected for yesterday’s wave of invites should all have the Mists of Pandaria beta client available for download through Battle.net account management, and they should all receive the email notification by end of day today. If the beta client shows up for you in Battle.net account management, you don’t need to wait for the email in order to download the client and begin testing.<br />
<br />
We’re off to a solid start with the beta test, and things are looking good in terms of realm stability, so we’re ready to invite another wave of Annual Pass holders. A second wave of invites is going out to 100,000 more Annual Pass holders today, starting right now.<br />
<br />
If you’re added in this or any subsequent wave, access to the beta client will show up in Battle.net account management as discussed above. Please check there today and tomorrow, as today’s wave of invites will be processing throughout the day and likely into early tomorrow morning. Notification emails will also be going out, but again, no need to wait for the email if the beta client is available to you through Battle.net account management.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about this, I've subbed since January 2005 and still haven't heard anything about a beta invite being on my account. Imo, this is serious crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well then they are doing it another way :P at first they were choosing the people by the rarity of the computer so they could test every possible system..now they are sending them to who ever. maybe whoever bought the pass first? like time wise? even if you bought it on the first day (which i did as well) they could be going by the actual time you were set up for it. just a guess though i don't know for sure.</div></div><hr />

Nobodoy said 2005 users would get on the first wave ( nor all 2004 users ), just wait a few hours, and you will most probably get your account flagged for beta.<br />
<br />
When they announced today the first beta wave I had to wait 6 hours for it to appear on my battle.net account.<br />

Be patient, the invites are coming, sooner or later.</div></div><hr />

Well I feel very sorry for you if WoW dominated your life that horribly. Because 7 years are a LOT of time. I've played WoW for 7 years wilst finishing school normally, beinga t university, having relationships, going out… and i'm not even upset I'm not in the beta!</div></div><hr />

I'm beginning to believe they just decided to select annual subscribers at random, judging by the stats of people who did/did not receive an invite. Possibly just easier to do it that way.</div></div><hr />

I think they will keep pushing their 'limits' as long as they see their servers are stable. I dont expect this kind of 'rush' waves to be handed out daily.<br />
I forsee it stopping at this wave, or the next, and then the next set of waves will come in again in a week or so when most of the intial invites have done 'playing' the beta.</div></div><hr />

You think because you did time in the military that it should gratify you access over someone who's whittled their life away playing this? Who's pay for the AP. <br />

well your friend is trolling you, because as Blizzard stated, they are doing NO OPT-IN INVITES until all AP holders have their invites...anyone who has an invite that does not have an AP is Press, Friends/Family, or Owner of the WoW Dell Laptop that came with Beta.</div></div><hr />

obviously blizzard is lying, I have seen his beta account since he just conveniently happens to be my roommate so I know for a fact that what they are saying is bullshit - maybe tho it is because the RAF account is linked to his main battle net account which still does not make sense since the account he is not paying for got the beta</div></div><hr />

See now this pisses me off. Good for you, seriously, I'm glad you got in, but it completely throws Blizzard's claim that total account time + AP time gives priority under the bus.<br />

That is not what he said. Bliz has claimed Beta invites are based on a formula that considers months of active account status and time of AP sub.<br />
He is complaining that being deployed overseas lowers his overall months of account status because he was not able to play while deployed. His sense of being disadvantaged due to service to the country is valid. Companies and public institution, especially after over a decade into a war, should have come to understand and account for the service of those who have been fighting a decade of war while the rest of America sat on their couches In previous wars many many companies did account for military service. In WWII companies were essentially drafted into the war like everyone else. It is a common sentiment among troops that the U.S. Military is at war while America is at the mall. We have no sense that most Americans understand, are aware, or even care about the sacrifice of troops and their families. You, are an example of this lack of awareness. He is not asking for special treatment for his deployment - he is asking that, when possible, he not be further disadvantaged for his deployment. I am currently deployed to Afghanistan. I also apparently have a warrant for my arrest in Oakland for failure to appear to a traffic violation. I called Oakland traffic court I was deploying for a year and would not ba able to appear in court on the court date. They gave me a 1 month extension for my court date even though my deployment is a year long. This is an example of the complete lack of willingness to account for or give consideration for soldiers and their families. Now, when I finish this (my second) year long deployment to war I have to deal with the unnecessary expense and frustration of dealing with this legal issue when I return. This kind of nonsense is a very common occurrence among deployed service members.</div></div><hr />
