(*) - Items with a (*) after their name are available from the vendor on the Sunwell Isle if you can provide the loot above it on the list along with a Sunmote. <br />
<br />
Example - You can get the Helm of Uther's Resolve (*) (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/helmofuthersresolve.jpg) by trading it to the vendor for Helm of Burning Righteousness (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/helmofburningrighteousness.jpg) and a [item=34664]<br />

Bosses<br />
Note on Kil'jaeden loot : Nobody killed him yet, however he will most likely be the only one dropping ilvl 164 items. You can already check a few of them at the Sunwell vendor but I'll only list the 3 that really look like they drop from Kil'jaeden himself (based on their itemID mostly). The three additional items are the one you can get from the vendor with an additional Sunmote, and Apolyon was added because it's an ilvl 164 weapon and that's probably the only boss it could drop from. Same goes for Thori'dal, it's confirmed to be a drop and I don't really see how it could not drop from the last boss of the dungeon. (Be careful though, the stats of both items are based on the leak posted a few weeks ago)<br />
<br />

A lot of weapons stats have been leaked through this Sunwell Loot screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) released before the PTR, so far nothing changed and you probably want to check it for items that aren't listed below yet. <br />

Dungeon Loot<br />
Legendary bow<br />
The legendary bow is indeed named Thori'dal (and supposedly drops from Kil'jaeden). And since everyone will ask for a proof, here are the spell IDs for some of the bonuses. (The spell names and bonuses are directly from the patch released today)<br />
<br />
44972 : Legendary Bow Haste - Increases ranged attack speed by 15%. Does not stack with quiver or ammo pouch haste effects.<br />
46699 : Requires No Ammo - Thori'dal generates magical arrows when the bow string is drawn. Does not use ammo.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sunwell plateau<br />
The old Sunwell Loot screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) is now confirmed. Bonuses on items are considered as spells and are directly added to the patch files, even if none of them dropped yet we can confirm that some of these loots are true and you can probably consider all of them legit now.<br />
<br />
Few examples of spells used in these items<br />
45059 : Vessel of the Naaru - Collects 100 Holy Energy from healing spells you cast. Cannot collect more than ${100*20} Holy Energy.<br />
45064 : Vessel of the Naaru - Release all accumulated Holy Energy to instantly heal current friendly target by the amount of Holy Energy accumulated.<br />
45355 : Item - T7 Melee Trinket Base - Chance on hit to enter a Battle Trance, during which your melee or ranged attacks will each grant 44 attack power, stacking up to 10 times. Expires after 20 seconds.<br />

The biggest dissapointment for me right now is the lack of love to the shamans, pvp wise. Reducing mana cost for Earth Shield by half, but also the number of charges means the cost per charge remains unchanged. It's still dispellable by everyone and his cat, unless you take a nice pve talent that noone in arena uses. Still no CC, no dependable anti-CC, nor anything else hinting towards an improvement in these areas.</div></div><hr />

Kil'jaeden's got a good model, and nice to see a rather unique model for human-Kalecgos. I like seeing that the Eredar twins got a better model than Sironas (just a darker female Draenei model there). And looks like we have yet another subspecies of the Elves. Elves seem to have more subspecies than any other race, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bow is the exact same DPS as Bristleblitz + Hyjal Ammo. Better DPS stats, though.<br />
<br />
If there's some other gun / ranged weapon from Sunwell (notice the models), it'll be better, if you choose to use ammo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, Blizzard announced that the &quot;real&quot; class changes will be coming in a patch between this one (2.4.0) and the release of WotLK. NOT in this one. Source. (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4311057787&amp;postId=43107517280&amp;sid=1#2)<br />
<br />
And then there's the promised PvP balancing. Well, it seems this was all that was needed to balance the scales sufficiently. And keep in mind that it's Blizzard that calls the shots in that regard. Also, more changes can be introduced during the PTR testing. That's what it's there for, after all.<br />
<br />
And lastly, we get new content! That beats simple changes and hotfixes any day of the week!</div></div><hr />

Indeed, good BM hunters already beat everybody on dps meters given the right group. In BG's they already lead killing blows and dmg done pretty much always. <br />
And now not only do they get their legendary weapon before a new expansion which means they'll most likely be supreme for quite some time but they also become the cheapest class ever with no costs for arrows/bullets on top of their already seriously deminished repaircosts (FD ftw) :o<br />
<br />
And then the worst part.. compare it with the currently best bow ingame.. 50% more dps!!<br />
Compare the current best 2H sword (Cataclysm's Edge) with the best bow (Black Bow of the Betrayer) or the legendary Kael weapon (Netherstrand Longbow)<br />
Now compare the sunwell best 2H (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg with this legendary bow.<br />
<br />

Take the Illidan/Arch bow and add arrow dps to them, their dps is comparable to the legendary. It will be an increase is steady shot dps though, I think.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rokh</div><div class="date">2008-02-09, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I repeat, the bow uses no ammo DPS. So, Bristleblitz + Ammo = the same DPS as the Legendary bow. So the only increase in DPS hunters will see is via Steady Shot, which doesn't use ammo, and base weapon damage instead.</div></div><hr />

More easy game more player base ;) how do you think they reached the 10million players worldwide? excluding the farmers ofc, they want people to experience the game as the patches are advertised.<br />
<br />
I am one of the hardcore raiders and I am very sad to see the BT/Hyjal attunements go but that was the same thing when BT/Hyjal patch came out.<br />

They seem to be completely lost at sea when it comes to balancing the game so that it is enjoyable for hardcore raiders and casual players alike. When I entered Hyjal late at night after killing Kael'Thas a while back it felt epic and grand. I rode around and checked it out, looked at the World Tree and got excited about starting to try Rage Winterchill the next day. My lvl 68 warlock can now walk in the door after hitting 70 when the patch is released, which feels a bit off.<br />
<br />
More than being pissed about Legolazzz the Nelf hunter in Alterac Valley having gear of similar quality to mine, it strikes me as harsh to deprive those who are just starting out in SSC/TK of the thrill from first entering Hyjal/BT. Going in there on Wednesdays to pick up some epics from Rage before wiping on Hydross for two hours isn't going to feel right, I think.<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of personnel rotations have been going on at Blizzard, but it strikes me as somewhat unlikely that Naxx'ramas quality gear would have been handed out at lvl 60 to players who ran Scholomance over and over again.<br />

I'm fine with older content getting easier, I remember pre-BC anyone who started playing 10 months before the Expansion had no chance of even seeing BWL if they didn't have friends doing Naxx to basically run them through.<br />

<br />
Personally, I don't like it that they are going to remove the T6 attunements. They are a) not hard and b) not complicated. If a guild can't kill Kael'thas I don't think they deserve to fight in Hyjal or BT. I, for myself, just got attuned last week to Hyjal. It felt really epic to go in there, check everything out and get Rage down on our first pull. Sadly, I wasn't up to him on the BT chain.<br />
It does take some effort to get attuned, I agree, but it's worth it. And instead of nerfing the attunements that should take a look at their &quot;here-take-a-few-free-epics&quot; PvP System. Oh well, it's their game, not like complaining will do change anything :(</div></div><hr />

If your guild is unable to kill both keal and vasjh then you should not have acces to the next tier of content.<br />

It's not going to benefit lower tier guilds half as much as it will upper tier ones who need to recruit and bring new characters up, people quit, crap happens, a lot of folks don't want to have to go back and clear dungeons they've stopped clearing.<br />
<br />
Naxxramas had the best attunement procedure, in my opinion, very interesting events, quests, scenes and a bit of work and cash from the players.<br />
<br />
AQ40, while being very laborious (probably as our guild single handledly did the whole damn thing in a server full of mediocre mooches), but it was still very fun.<br />
<br />
But I can understand a bit how people feel, especially with how the BC raiding is paced. Which is pretty lousy, to be honest.<br />
<br />
One idea might be though, to make guild based attunements, such as &quot;50% of the activate raid must have felled Kael'thas in order to enter _____&quot;<br />
<br />
It cuts out guilds who haven't made the achivement, but allows alts and new recruits. Remove the requirement for old raids upon each expansion so casuals and pugs can check out the old content.<br />
<br />
Hopefully something like that will happen in the future, I think it's very fair. Also would still like to see badges replace rraid drops as well, as an old MMO vet PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let the archaic DKP system die.</div></div><hr />

I believe if Blizzard is going to let the majority of the player base see these instances, they shouldn't be nerfing the fights. I think if you're going to get the easy way in, you should work at least twice or maybe three times the work for BT/Hyjal; cause to be honest.... these fights are pretty easy.<br />
<br />
So please. If you're going to lift attunements, at least have the decency to either 1.) Quit nerfing PvE content or 2.) Double or even Triple the difficulty of these instances so that at least people can have a sense of accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

The lift is for the guild that are in it, who don't have a stable core group. When you get a new member... what are you supposed to do? Trial them in.. heroics? ZA? Get all 24 people to go back to SSC/TK for a trial, to find out that person sucks, recruit another, go back again? <br />

The lifting HELPS BT guilds, and I don't see why your all QQing about it.

<br />
While I'm not all in favor that the attunements be dropped, I disliked the atunement style of TBC. It was pretty stupid really, and, tbh, a mere pacing mechanism so that Blizz had more time to create content.<br />
<br />
According to most people, Vash + Kaelthas are harder than the first bosses (well, some would all bosses but Illidan). What is the logic of to fight Average boss 2 you have to kill Hard boss 1? From a PVE and progression pointo of view... None. Except as a pacing mechanism from a dev POV.<br />
<br />
On the other hand it seems that many players claiming &quot;omg the sky is gonna fall, scrubs will enter BT&quot; are actually pretty new wow players (post TBC raiders). AQ40 had no attunement whatsoever, never had (once the gates were open and that was a server wide event). Have you seen PUGs or &quot;scrub guilds that couldn't go past ZG&quot; doing it? No, don't think so. Naxx, the mythical lvl 60 raid dungeon, had a personal attunement - you could solo it. Never so anyone complaining &quot;to enter Naxx one should Kill C'thun first! Otherwise Scrubs will enter it&quot;. The same has happened in TBC with TK... did suddenly guilds that coulnd't down Gruul start TKing successfully? <br />
<br />
So in conclusion, it doesn't change all that much, those who can down the boss deserve to be there - that is the measure of worthiness, not some &quot;attunement&quot; requirement that makes absolutely no logic lore wise (yeah, that still exists :P).<br />
<br />
What I don't like - but that has not been the first time it has happened on this second rate expansion (and I'm being nice) - is that the requirements change. So while I deeply dislike the previously existing attunement requirements, I don't like Blizz to change the rules in the middle of the game ^^.<br />
<br />
But don't fret over it really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The lifting HELPS BT guilds, and I don't see why your all QQing about it. People are not going to be killing BT bosses anytime soon...even with badge gear, the experience in SSC/TK is needed, even with a good core of raiders, and mid-sub-par gear... you need to get the grouping experience to go past BT.<br />
<br />
The heroic badge gear... that's something to QQ about though. QQ away :P <br />

Tell me, how many people in old wow had Naxx quality welfare epics from grinding let's say (for the sake of argument) from Stratholme before actually entering Naxx?<br />
<br />
Attunments are not the problem... the fact that Karazhan scrubs will enter BT in T6 (quality) gear while everyone else had to struggle with T5/random is.</div></div><hr />

qft. And you know all these fights are gonna get nerfed in 2.4.1. So basically you get 1) no attunments 2) T6 gear from Kara, SP, and Mechanar, and 3) nerfed bosses that were already loot bags.

<br />
1150 GUILDS on wowjutsu have killed Illidan (at least that's how many there were a week ago). And that's the final boss of the game, imagine how many more have downed Rage....... (And imagine how many people are in those guilds total).<br />
<br />
5%? I think not. Certainly more than 5% of people who WANT to see the content (leaving out scrubs in their 50s who don't even know what a raid is and just started playing).</div></div><hr />

Yes you will be able to do it by pure grunt force because you will have welfare T6 by grinding Karazhan.<br />

Attunment removing is fine. Giving welfare T6 to lolsuals who grind Moroes is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually not - they explicitly stated that they were doing class balancing, in a way that could be understood as extensive. Later one blue somewhat retracted on that statement, for a more &quot;progressive approach&quot;. Bullocks if you ask me, but hell, this is Blizzard :D<br />
<br />
<br />
And, btw, loot reaver is a badly designed boss from a progression point of view - and *maybe* some in BT also are - one guild I know off, really worked to get Kael down. When they went into BT they downed the first 2 bosses in the first night. While I don't mind that the first bosses of an &quot;upper level&quot; instances are easier than the final(s) one(s) from the previous one, as it makes a good raiding alternative, it makes no sense if to access those easier bosses you have to down the harder ones first. Which is happening atm, and it is a bad design decision.</div></div><hr />

You can already get a few pieces of near hyjal quality loot off the badge vendor, didn't see anyone whining then, but now all of a sudden when a new level of raiding comes out and Blizzard opens the former to everyone (gasp sounds like Arenas and their seasons doesn't it?) everyone throws a hissy fit...</div></div><hr />

You can easily get 150-200 badges a week.<br />

<br />
just looking at my resto druid alt, who would need a crazy 200+ badges atm for the 4 item upgrades I want, adding in another 300 badges to get an additional 3 (which may be on same slots!), you get around 500 badges to get half-geared out.

BT/Hyj Went live June 07 8 months and counting<br />
<br />
2.4 Test Released Feb 08 (Typically Major patches are tested for a couple months, with further updates added as the testing progresses.)<br />
<br />
2.4 goes Live maybe late April early May or later if problems in testing ensue.<br />
<br />
So This gives your BT guilds nearly a year of bragging rights or do the content virtually as initially given.<br />

WotLK on the Horizon expected out late 2008, Changes happen BC Raids will be dead with WotLK release, and everyone will be in greens =P<br />

Daily heroic + Botanica = 10 badges minimum x7 = 70<br />
Karazhan = 22 badges (or was it 21?)<br />
Zul'aman 2 resets = 26 badges<br />

so it's 118 badges without even trying... do one more heroic every day and you get §150 badges.<br />

C) Again Changes happen, all this will be for naught and be pimping greens before you say Ding! 71<br />
<br />
<br />
a) Are you saying that EVERY casual has 500+ euros to spend on a T6 geared ebay? Because every casual will have easy access to T6 welfare gear. Even if he did that he'd get gkicked the moment officers found out he's been ebayed.<br />
<br />
b) S3 &#8800; T6<br />
No decent guild will accept you at T6 lvl in S3. Guilds doing &quot;cutting edge&quot; Karazhan runs will but then again, S3 is an overkill for what's now a overgrown heroic.<br />
<br />
c) We're talking about 2.4, not 3.0</div></div><hr />

No they were just merely examples. People are getting bent over nothing. yes Guilds have screening processes this is a great example to why people already in BT/Hyj should not care when this goes live. <br />
<br />
As for the example on WotLK sure its not 2.4 but again its looking at the bigger picture, you have individuals getting bent on the game being opened to more then just 5-10% of the WoW population. Where Xpac2 will be released in less time BT/Hyj has been Live. and all this gear will be a Keepsake at best.<br />
<br />
That S3 gear btw again may not be the most Optimal raiding gear but for a skilled player with minimal exp. in the further end game content would be a better option app'n up to a BT raiding guild, w/o having to get run through for gear. <br />
<br />
In conclusion Gear doesnt = Skill. As someone earlier stated if they are dropping bosses in BT/Hyj they have clearly earned the right to be there. If they get wiped on trash and Bosses they will revert to SSC/Eye</div></div><hr />

That's the problem... game was ALWAYS open to everybody who was willing to put an effort... Attunment process was open for everyone, it wasn't private or locked that only the &quot;chosen&quot; were allowed to participate in.<br />
<br />
No player who's got skills in end game would be using S3... and if he has experience, he has the gear for it.<br />
<br />
And while gear = skill it plays a big part in game progress... that's why we have tiers afterall.<br />
<br />
And Shadowclaimer, if i was able to down a boss on my first night within an hour, you would have a point. But while a guild might take 2-4 months to clear an instance, let alone farm it, you will, by simply grinding your e-z mode runs get the same gear. Without sharded drops, without waiting for months for your token/item to drop... just by doing e-z mode KZ/ZA/Heroics.</div></div><hr />

yeah dude ur totally right cuz i definently didnt have to grind gear to spend an hour killing that boss....i just turned 70 and BAM downed stuff in BT, i definenty dont deserve that gear<br />

True to a point, and a very small point at that. The very small percentage of the WoW pop. that is out there doing this content and have it on farm, are the players have virtually no life and or no restrictions that would prevent them from meeting the very strict and regimen Raiding reqs of said T6 Raiding guilds. <br />
<br />
So by your theory anyone not already clearing the very end game content is lacking skill? For the player base that cant simply ignore RL have no right seeing all of the games content? Or Players who started late in the game, what about them, are they not skilled and desearving?<br />
<br />
your points are weak my friend, there is more to the picture that you and others in the like of your opinion are failing to see. BT guilds have had their time, still get the bragging rights and I did it pre nurfs etc... These others dont effect you what so ever. It doesn't take away from your gaming experience. It just simply takes away an already lame attument process out of the picture. why complain? <br />
<br />
as for the S3 gear you speak of it like it is so much inferior...perhaps you should look at the stats and compare them, the stats are adjusted to favor PVP vs PVE but its a perfectly acceptable subst. for apps to those guilds till they get the raiding gear.</div></div><hr />

If you fail to do arenas you deserve the same gear as those who are winning all the time?<br />
No.<br />
No attunements is fine, epics for failing are not and there's suddenly no reason to even call them epics :p<br />
The whole statement by Shadowclaimer is pretty flawed, those 4 hours a day spent doing heroics could have been done raiding and you'd clear BT before next expansion anyways.<br />
<br />
(Not to pull the &quot;I have a life&quot; statement, because I actually dont have a life, but there are actually alot of people in endgame guilds having a life, a family and a job, they made it work and so could alot of the other casuals, but I guess it's easier being lazy.)</div></div><hr />

RL excuse is weak... very very weak...<br />
<br />
I am finishing university, have a job and yet i am able to raid. It takes my guild 3-3.5 hrs to clear BT and 2 hrs to clear MH. That's 2 raids a week. When it's new content we raid 3-4 times a week. Everyone can do it, it just depends how interested you are in it and what you're willing to sacrifice. You wanna watch your TV shows, play wow when you feel like it AND get the same gear who focus only on the game?<br />
<br />
Where's the &quot;fairness&quot; everyone's so eager to jump to when this is mentioned?<br />
<br />
As for S3 gear as &quot;decent&quot; replacement, it's pure BS... There is no usable PvE tanking gear and PvE healing in PvP gear is very difficult to say the least. So no, S3, beyond a few weapons, is NOT a viable replacement for PvE gear.<br />
<br />
Why i complain? Because after 5 months i haven't seen my boots drop and someone who spent their time wiping and farming in Karazhan will get the equivalent item the day 2.4 hits while i can either continue raiding and praying the drops i need will drop or skip it and farm heroics and karazhan that i am sick of... see my point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Briefly I stated the S3 gear would be a viable Substitute not a replacement. as they are appn' up and trying to be a part of a better raiding guild. Obviously they would get the raiding gear and use that for Raids. you are right its not viable for every situation, but for most it is. <br />
<br />
as for the &quot;RL Excuse&quot; its not a weak point, sure you have managed to make it work, but let me ask you this how long have you played wow? and during that time how long have you been attached to said guild? if you were already in a raiding guild that is decent to great, props man, seriously good for you that you get your cake and eat it to. But for the majority of the population there is more that plays into all these different scenarios. RL is a huge impact for most players, not all of us have the luxury of making everything come together. <br />
<br />
My personal example, been playing for 2 years now, joined my brothers realm, Muradin most of us know it sucks for raiding no surprise there. Did I know that when He got me to start playing? no. Ive been a hardcore gamer all my life (late twenties) I love to raid and the lore and such, and would love to see all of the content and look bad ass to boot. But do to a very bad raiding server, and RL family kids job and such. I just cant xfer to a decent server, virtually start all over and Sacrifice my RL for a game that was meant to be a luxury. In the end Wow is a game, and not meant to be a lifestyle. (sadly it is for most of us...) So Here I am barely broken into SSC/Eye cause of RL and sticking with other friends that have no ambition, a product of enviroment, but I digress. <br />
<br />
as for those getting gear that is equivalent to what you have/been waiting to get I feel ya man, I really do it sux. But it has been around for a while now, and anyone playing this game long enough this a revolving door waiting to happen. the Devs said its the closing of BC, come WotLK we start again and go through the motions all over again. (which I personally waiting for so I can actually see the game come Xpac.)</div></div><hr />

You don't need T5. T4 quality gear with some badge items and weapons from PVP is more than enough. I've seen warriors tanking Illidan while still wearing the tier 4 helm.</div></div><hr />

What does it matter if someone else has the same gear you do, why do you care about someone else you wont ever meet in an instance because you are already seeing content he wont. I really wish I knew what this obsession is about other people having better gear then you, get over yourselves, this game shouldnt be about gear more so the gear should be there to enable you to have fun in the game ala new content like Sunwell.<br />

ok true, but looking at the bigger picture again... all the work the very small % of Raiding guilds that have done the work and have this on farm will be pointless with WotLk. The focus should be on the Fun aspect of the game and not about Joe Schmo that you will never interact with. <br />
<br />
People who have done it get bragging rights, the &quot;scrubs&quot; wont. Its all imaginary gear anyhow... so in the end the bragging rights is all that matters =D. Enjoy the game mates, or look for the next challenge in a different game. no point in getting ansy over a test patch that is not even activated yet. Lots of things can and will likely change during the test phase.</div></div><hr />

You're completely right. Blizzard doesn't care about how many epics you have, attunements and all that junk.<br />
They just want to give players almost free epics (which makes &quot;no-attunement&quot; raids possible, like in upcoming patch).<br />
The main reason is, probably, that they just want to maintain the game, before WotLK release.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich king will make all your 'epics' totally worthless.<br />
That's right. But what's the point with giving free epics to players?<br />
There were no such actions a few months before TBC?</div></div><hr />

Seriously, WTH is no attunement for BT or Hyjal??? You're going to see this soon: &quot;LFG BT/Mount Hijeal.

<br />
<br />
The test hasn't gone active yet..., wont go live till closer till summer. The time 2.4 is live to WotLK will be less time that BT/Hyj has been Live. If your guild hasnt gotten it done b4 2.4 goes live where/when it actually impacts WoW players. Then you technically fall under the description of &quot;scrub&quot;. Regardless of where they are in the End Game content, what you have accomplished thus far is bragging rights. Its all a game and none of this will matter come WotLK, let alone your RL achievements. So please stop focusing on a tiny change, that again hasn't even changed in the test world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So all it takes is good gear to clear an instance, it doesnt take any sort of organizational skills to get people online, the time to attend raids to make progress and decent knowledge of the game to maximize everything you have. <br />
<br />
I can sympathize to the people who did it first but you shouldnt be the only person capable of seeing this content, by now you should realize that this will probably happen since they removed the attunements to most of the other instances first, along with t5 quality badges.</div></div><hr />

And the only people I ever see whining is the raiders, to be honest. Just because EverQuest was a counter intuitive, ball stomping time sink doesn't mean the genre has to be solely for the hardest of the hardcore forever.<br />
<br />
This genre is young, very very young, and very underdeveloped. You cannot just loop people into &quot;LOL BUT IT'S AN MMORPG&quot; because one REALLY, REALLY mediocre developer was the first to market with a 3D one. Considering UO was whole fully easy to get going in, and was all about content and consequences, I'd say it had the best attempt yet in 97</div></div><hr />

<br />
No difference between a noob that can't play his class after 70 levels of playing it, and a full tier6 geared raider.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cry more you loser.<br />
<br />
Go do something productive with your life. You're taking the game way too seriously. &quot;Waaah they take away attunements and make bosses easier, waaahhhhh&quot;<br />
<br />
You hardcores make me laugh. You spend so much time into a stupid computer game, and in a few month, at level 80, we'll all be on the same gear level.<br />
<br />
You think that a raider 'knows how to play their class'? Yeah a paladin spamming heals on a tank sure is skilled.... So is that mage spamming frostbolts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take some time off the game. WoW has always been a casual gamer's mmo. You don't like it, then play something else.</div></div><hr />

you dont own this game, nothing is supposed to be given to you, nor you are in any way privileged by doing so called &quot;hardcore&quot; raiding.<br />
in few months all your shiny epics will be worth 100g, make sure you enjoy them now.<br />
all good guilds that have done BT and have it on farm will proceed to ST, not giving a shit about the rest, besides maybe sentiment, if you wanna be on top you got to work all the time, not sit there and lol @ ppl who are halfway to the peak<br />
for christ sake its just a game!<br />
<br />
(it pisses me off the same way when i see lvl x9 &quot;i got huge e-peen&quot; twink order some x0-x8 lvl player to leave bg, while he/she also pays monthly fee to have some fun. wtf you are nazis or something? you gonna kill ppl coz they are &quot;worse&quot; than you?<br />
is she/he the cause of your loss? probably<br />
is she/he not allowed to play the way she/he enjoy the most? NO)<br />
<br />
BT/MH att. removal, and better epix are natural chain of events nowadays. same goes for s1-s3 gear, get over it.<br />
<br />
developer POV:<br />
why to make content that only 5% of ppl would ever see on their eyes, while you can improve the rest of it, and more ppl will be happy?<br />
pro-solution:make &quot;elite&quot; content for 5% of players, and while another &quot;elite&quot; content is rdy let others enter the previous.<br />
<br />
looking forward to promissed real-deal class changes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. years ago only small part of extremely rich people had electric light in their houses/mansions, now even you got it. think about it when you will whine again about casuals entering BT.<br />
see what i did tharrr? hope so, its quite late already here. <br />

<br />
<br />
A lot of people don't want to be hardcore. It's a computer game. We have other aspects to our life. You talk as if attaining 'hardcore' status is some sort of achievement.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But yet players in WoW cry about every single time a instance require anything NEAR skill, or is anywhere NEAR a challenge. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only crying I hear is from you about the removal of the MH and BT attunements. No one else gives a **** except for these hardcore players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still see noobs wanting crowcontrol for heroics, we don't use crowcontrol in our heroics, we just tank the fucking mobs and kill them before they kill us. That is a challenge, yet noobs want the instance nerfed because they can't find 3 mages to help them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wow you guys are so pro man. You're in Hyjal and BT gear and you guys don't need cc for heroics? Jeez, you guys are so f'n pro.<br />
<br />
Yeah, all heroic groups (even groups in blue gear) should be doing heroics without cc right? Dumbass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow elitism at its finest here folks, take a good long look because this is a prime example you'll want to look at for future reference if need be.<br />
<br />
First of all who are you to decide who gets what, you are not a game developer and you probably never will be thank god, this game contrary to what you believe is open to anyone who pays for it, even the 9 year old kids who have mommy pay for their subscriptions whom arent past level 20 yet have a privilege to play this game. <br />
<br />
Sure some of these instances get nerfed because people are incapable of clearing it but why do you care, are you so insecure about yourself in a video game that you have to make sure you are constantly on top, does it mean that much to you that what you accomplish means everything to someone else? If thats true then I dont think YOU deserve to play this game, I think you need restriction from WOW and the internet because what you do will mean nothing a few years from now. <br />
<br />
Do you think 20-30 years from now you're going to tell your grandchildren &quot;WELL I USED TO FIRST CLEAR BT ALL THE TIME BEFORE ANYONE ELSE COULD, AND WE GOT ALL THE WORLD FIRSTS IN WOTLK&quot;? I hope not because no one cares about what you accomplish in the long run, all you're doing is masturbating to your own self-centered ego until you realize that what you did wasnt really worth it and that it would of been better to just enjoy it without making yourself out to be a total elitist douchebag. You could of been playing wow for fun without grinding &quot;HARDCORE&quot; stuff as much as you wanted to and had the option of doing anything you wanted to outside of the video game without worrying all your other elitist douchebag friends would drop you if you missed a few weeks of raids.<br />
<br />
Good day.<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW I finally got a look at your armory, I find it so funny that you talk like this when you are hardly anywhere near BT gear wise, nor do your arena ratings reflect this innate &quot;Skill&quot; you think raiding and instances require that you believe you have. Infact I'd go so far to say that what you say is so off from your actual character progression that you are just trolling.</div></div><hr />

I Think, thta those items are Actually Sunwell RAID drops (itemlvl 159 /164), but because the slots with 6 bosses are kind of limited, they made all extra needed itemd &quot;badge&quot; rewards. (and to limited trading a bit, they probably added the sunmote )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Windcape, I wont bother to disassemble your post, but I'll just say that Wow is and can be a rather encompassing game. The benchmark of &quot;performance&quot; for raiders is to be able to down bosses. One may complain about the nerf of bosses, but not really about facilitating the access to them. Unless, of course, those &quot;great challenging bosses&quot; are not that challenging.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I remember doing SH heroic with no CC whatsoever when I was in Kara with my old guild. All it takes is a good tank and good healing. But if you don't have either then you really don't have other resort than going the CC way. <br />
<br />
I've done wow end game - not edge but pretty well, particularly before TBC. I do think that raiders were mistreated by Blizzard, not so much by the attunement drop but by a great deal of other factors (broken raid ladder, itemization, PVP leeching,...). Do I think that end game raiding is the ultimate wow challenge - Yes. Do I think that it should have the best gear/status symbol? Yes. Do I think It should be the only gear path or playing style available for players? No, of course not.<br />
<br />
This is not a win/lose situation or game.</div></div><hr />

I love the 20-30 yr question, moronic at best. In 20-30 Yrs are you gonna tell your grand children, you were dumb enough to spend 60k on a car, or how big your first apartment was... No. Anything you do, you do for a reason.. because you enjoy it and it meets your lifestyle. Just because you cant commit to more play time and the next guy can.. why is he bad? I play WoW in access of 40-50 hours a week. I work full time, Im a realtor. I choose to spend my time playing WoW instead of camped in front of the Idiot Box.. except for tuesdays, when I watch &quot;House&quot;. Im lucky enough that my wife is also a gamer so I dont have to listen to what most of your guys do. Anyway.. On to my point. <br />
There are alot of people who truly enjoy the competitiveness of being in a Hardcore Raiding guild. Its a game yes, but if your going to spend time doing something, why not do it to the best of your ability. I played EQ from Beta through GoD. Ive played WoW since Beta2. Ive been in some Hardcore guilds in EQ, but WoW isnt the same style of game. Its built for the casual gamer, with the low end computer, who cant commit more than a little time a day and still wants it all. Blizz has cornered the Casual Market, there is no question. It will never be more than that. To the Hardcore player, its nothing more than a way to kill time, til something better comes out. With Blizzards current round of Dumbing Down Content enhancements its making things even worse. <br />
<br />
Just my 2¢</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey, I do to I've raided in BT and Hyjal (Granted I quit raiding quickly before my guild ever got into BT) and I think its fine that people can find a way to play this game the way they see fit and I do agree with you that you should do everything to the best of your ability (REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONDITION!!). HOWEVER, I do not run around telling people that because they do not play at my level they dont DESERVE to play the game the way they see fit, I have no issue with people who play this game more then its probably healthy for them because hey, I grinded out rank 14 (Total waste of time and yes Im stupid) and thats our choice. <br />
<br />
But as soon as you place your own opinion onto someone else and throw in insults I will have an issue with it, I think there should be content for each side of the card which is how this system is working. Hardcores have done everything they can to get to the content first and to be the best in a game, but suddenly they think its their right to hold onto that content months after they are done and finished with it, and quite frankly it is childish to act that way.<br />
<br />
The whole point of the '20-30 years old from now comment', was basically to prove that there is no point in being a jerk to someone else online if they dont play as much as you do when it will really result in nothing gained or lost at the end.</div></div><hr />

With that logic, why is it nessary level up a character? Just let me start at level 70!<br />
With that logic, why is it nessary get gear from instances to progress? Just let me get it all for free by ingame mail , so I can go kill Illidan!<br />
<br />
P.S. Illidan need to drop me 2 warglaives, and they need to be useable by my hunter! As you say, there is no reason to restrict content (items must go as content, no?) to people who can kill a boss.<br />
<br />
I mean, if people can't kill Kael'thas, but still need to enter hyjal, why don't give them the Tier5 chestpiece at the same time ?-)<br />
<br />
<br />
Gear grinds are necessary in this game to control the flow at which characters progress, if there were no gear grinds in this game we'd be through and done with this game and get bored extremely quick before the devs could make anything new to satiate our hunger for a month at most. However, if you somehow think that giving people access to t6 quality badge loot is &quot;Handing away&quot; free items then you are most likely mistaken. Badges still require you to run Karazhan, Zul'aman, AND heroics, which all take a still decent amount of !!TIME!! to complete. Im not saying blizzard should hand out free items because it would ruin this game, but at the same time someone shouldnt have to raid 4+ hours a day X days a week to even remotely think about looking at some of this content that they pay for. <br />
<br />
You can casually grind an instance for an hour for a few badges, but you can not join a guild and only raid one hour every couple days and expect to still be in that guild unless of course they operate like that.<br />
<br />
Chances are with all this gear people will still have a hard time raiding instances because of how much time it will require, but its better that they have a chance at seeing the content then never having the chance at all.<br />
<br />
As for the warglaives part, you took my comment completely out of context, I dont think mages should be wielding 2 hand axes anytime soon.<br />
<br />
If you really want a game that caters to the Hardcore of the hardcore, go play Lineage 2 and fulfill to your hearts content.</div></div><hr />

You hardcores make me laugh. You spend so much time into a stupid computer game, and in a few month, at level 80, we'll all be on the same gear level.<br />

You think that a raider 'knows how to play their class'? Yeah a paladin spamming heals on a tank sure is skilled.... So is that mage spamming frostbolts.<br />

Oh geez, so you have to learn a little mechanic, that never changes when encountering a boss. Yeah that must be really f'n hard to do.<br />
<br />
Must be so hard to know that at X time the boss will do Y. Yeah and if you can learn that mechanic (months, and months of study ::) ) and your guild downs that boss, that makes you a f'n pro, and you can trash talk people who just want to play the game every now and then and have fun. AMIRITE?</div></div><hr />

That's about all I hear from you, but I suppose you're right. WoW is a casual gamer's MMO. Why else would Blizzard continue to reward the failure and mediocrity of a casual player such as yourselves? First they toss you heroic badges as an alternative to get up-to-snuff with your more &quot;committed&quot; counterparts. Then they put Arena gear purchasable through honor points to flood you with even more welfare gear. And because that couldn't satisfy you enough, they're lifting the attunements for you to put your welfare gear to the test and see if you can &quot;earn&quot; your Tier 6 and above like the rest the endgame players. <br />
<br />
I don't mind the attunement lift, seeing as how the same groups who were stuck in a rut when the SSC/TK attunements were lifted then will be similarly stuck when BT/Hyjal attunements are lifted next patch. Despite your shots at the &quot;hardcore raiders,&quot; I strongly doubt that someone of your caliber will ever see T6, even with the attunements lifted.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merin</div><div class="date">2008-02-10, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP isn't any more difficult than raiding. This is why cookie cutter setups are the norm and always the most prevelant, you do the same strategies every night in arena and pray for proper RNG rolls, class matchups based off your setup and fuck ups.<br />
<br />
PvP is perfectly fine however, because it received an update to make it whole fully intuitive and achievable in small setups. Typically the best PvPers are high tier players who are also good PvEers, so I always found the welfare epic line to be a bit awkward.<br />
<br />
I'm an old school raider, I raided in EQ, FFXI, and WoW since the start. But I do not think there's anything wrong with BLizzasrd attempting to take a progressive approach to raiding in the future, the fact is far less people raid on the whole now than they did prior to BC because more reasonable alternatives exist.<br />
<br />
Attunements are something that should be done for fun, for lore, etc. Naxxramas was on the money, SSC/TK were a trainwreck, bottlenecking through a 10 man on the first real 25 man dungeon in the game.<br />
<br />
BT was more reasonable, but still a pain in the ass as time goes by. People quit, situations occur. If you're not actively clearing a dungeon it really takes a hatchet to a schedule to try and squeeze one in for new recruits or alts.<br />
<br />
I can understand where people are coming from, though, early bosses in dungeons tend to be far easier than the final boss in past ones. The best thing to do would be to lay guild based requirements, such as having 50% of the current raid to have beaten the final boss of the last tier dungeon to enter the next. This allows alts, new recruits, etc, in a raid that has obviously been successful previously.<br />
<br />
Other things that need to happen with raiding; less consumables required for main dungeons, I've ceased my raiding recently but I was dropping about 150g a day, which is a lot when you use it to raid for 5 hours <br />
<br />
Kill the DKP system once and for all and put in badges. No one has fun waiting three months to get a lucky drop. Also, lessen trash pulls in here and WORK ON THE DAMNED BOSSES.<br />
<br />
BC's boss fights were terrible, after the early BC overnerf Blizzard always puts on their neigh invincible bosses since no one there can balance anything, nothing prior to Kael'thas approached old world content, and most of BT/Hyjal was just as bad. Trash is a nessecary evil, but it really needs to be made into an entertaining event rather than a glut of easy mobs &quot;just coz&quot;. That's flat our poor game design even on the MMO level. I've always hated it.</div></div><hr />

Hate to ask this again, but will there be or does anyone know where there is a mirror for the US test realm client. I absolutely cannot get the blizzard downloader to work this time.

However, if you somehow think that giving people access to t6 quality badge loot is &quot;Handing away&quot; free items then you are most likely mistaken. Badges still require you to run Karazhan, Zul'aman, AND heroics, which all take a still decent amount of !!TIME!! to complete. Im not saying blizzard should hand out free items because it would ruin this game, but at the same time someone shouldnt have to raid 4+ hours a day X days a week to even remotely think about looking at some of this content that they pay for. <br />
<br />
You can casually grind an instance for an hour for a few badges, but you can not join a guild and only raid one hour every couple days and expect to still be in that guild unless of course they operate like that.<br />
<br />
Chances are with all this gear people will still have a hard time raiding instances because of how much time it will require, but its better that they have a chance at seeing the content then never having the chance at all.<br />
<br />
As for the warglaives part, you took my comment completely out of context, I dont think mages should be wielding 2 hand axes anytime soon.<br />
<br />
If you really want a game that caters to the Hardcore of the hardcore, go play Lineage 2 and fulfill to your hearts content.<br />
<br />
<br />
So an hour of heroics every few days gets you gear too? Stop kidding yourself, you're not one of those people that play &quot;an hour every few days&quot; if you got 70 in less than a year. Those kinds of people aren't 70, and they sure as hell don't know what a &quot;heroic dungeon&quot; is.</div></div><hr />

I've learned that I enjoy the trip to becoming well-geared much more than actually BEING well-geared. I had the opportunity to buy a fully-geared resto druid from a friend of mine pre-BC, and I turned him down because I didn't have the slightest idea what I would use it for if I had it. When you've already got all the gear, what's the point in playing? When I start running out of gear to aim for, I get bored, only log on to my main when it's time to raid, spend the rest of the time leveling alts so I'll have new characters to get gear for.<br />
<br />
I didn't even run many heroics on my main until recently because I'm a SSC/TK-geared healing priest (my guild's working on Vashj currently) and most of the badge stuff they added for my class in 2.3 was junk to me (haste pants with no mana regen or sockets... bracers with spell crit? what the hell) and I literally have no use for nethers as an Alchemist. Hearing that there will be new badge gear (and seeing that it may very well be stam/int/spirit/healing/haste gear with sockets, exactly the kind of thing I want) motivates me to play my priest again so that I can stock up on badges in preparation for 2.4. Any change that makes me want to play my priest more is a good change, I think. Now all I want to know is how many badges and heroic gems I'm gonna need.<br />
<br />
Oh and as a side note... anybody else noticed the new &quot;PvP&quot; ret pally blues are PERFECTLY tailored for PvE? Strength/Int/Stam/Crit with some nice sockets, no resilience to speak of except in the set bonus. I was hoping their &quot;reitemization&quot; of ret pally gear would include swapping spell damage for resilience on the S1/S2 gear, but the new pvp blues don't leave me with much hope.</div></div><hr />

other thing i dont know is why a blue pvp set when s1 can be bought with honor?<br />
another epic set like s1 via exalted with factions could be better</div></div><hr />

Actually, it does. If they make the game so that only people that can play 40-45 hours a week can get their 15$ worth, they'll have a fraction of their current player base.<br />
<br />
Not all of us have the grueling workdays that realtors have. Some of us actually have to get up at 6:30AM and can expect to be home roughly 12 hours later.<br />
<br />
Btw, about 1 of 70 persons in california are licensed realtors. So the fact that you call yourself a &quot;realtor&quot; doesn't mean that you have &quot;a job&quot;, especially with the cratering housing market. It just mean you passed a very short, very easy course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lets see, a quick run through all the changes or predicted class changes and we see:<br />
<br />
Druid: 0 / 8 things from fake notes in real, 0 / 7 things from real notes in fake. Total: 0 / 15<br />
Hunter: 0 / 1 things from fake notes in real, 0 / 4 things from real notes in fake. Total 0 / 5<br />
Mage: 0 / 13 things from fake notes in live, 0 / 7 things from real notes in fake. Total 0 / 20<br />
Priest: 0 / 5 things from fake notes in live, 0 / 9 things from real notes in fake. Total 0 / 14<br />
Paladin: 0 / 4 things from fake notes in live, 0 / 5 things from real notes in fake. Total 0 / 9<br />
Rogue: 0 / 1 things from fake notes in live, 0 / 4 things from live notes in fake. Total 0 / 5<br />
Shaman: 2 / 7 things from fake notes in live, 2 / 8 things from live notes in fake. Total 2 / 13 (cant count the same item twice)<br />
Warrior: 0 / 1 things from fake notes in live, 0 / 4 things from live notes in fake. Total 0 / 5 (I leave out endless rage change because it had already been blue confirmed before the fake notes came out).<br />
Warlock: 0 / 6 things from fake notes in live, 0 / 5 things from live notes in fake. Total 0 / 11 (the fake didnt even get the summon change which had already been blue confirmed right).<br />
<br />
So our final total, out of the 46 items in the fake notes, 2 are in the test notes, out of the 98 total changes between the real and fake notes only two are shared. I think you are being more than generous if you say that fake notes with only barely more than 2% accuracy worth reading. The most generous way to measure them has under 5% accuracy (interestingly their 2 item changes were both wrong too).<br />
<br />
The fake notes were a complete waste of time. They should never have been posted on the site. Funnily enough my only prediction for these patch notes was that earth shield would get a 30% chance to resist dispel because it is exactly what blizz have been giving to classes who have trouble with their spells being purged. By that rate it would be smarter to post anything I make up because I have a 100% accuracy on predictions for this patch.<br />
<br />
It is far more likely that the pathetic number of right predictions in the fake notes is more or a case of the sun shining on a dogs arse once in its life (i.e. random chance), or that blizzard saw that suggestion in the fake patch notes (or elsewhere) and decided they liked it than it is a case for them being accurate insider information and whoever sent them is either full of crap or so low on the pecking order that they don't have a clue what is going on.<br />
<br />
So please, the next time you get fake notes please leave them as a mere post in the general discussion forum where they belong. They are not news as so many people pointed out.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
A little googling shows the following post from Eyonix 5 days before the fake patch notes hit: (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4311202681&amp;sid=1)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing that will help is that in patch 2.4, healing grace will reduce the chance that all of your spells will be dispelled by 10/20/30%.<br />
<br />
<br />
With that in mind I am excluding that from the list of chances. The only &quot;correct&quot; prediction now would be the mana cost reduction, however since the mana reduction was attempted prior with a 30 second cooldown and rolled back pending a resolution to the dispelling issue:<br />
<br />
Eyonix again:<br />
<br />
<br />
In the current version of patch 2.3.2 we added a 30 second cooldown to earth shield and lowered the mana cost by approximately 50%. We have decided to temporarily revert both of these changes until we address the dispel issue, which will likely be for patch 2.4.<br />
<br />
In short, earth shield will not be changed in patch 2.3.2. <br />
<br />
You are finally left with a fake patch notes that got 1 item correct and that was an item that had already been alluded to in a blue post.<br />
<br />
So bearing that in mind, you have 1 correct prediction, a prediction that blues had already hinted to. In short, please no more fake patch notes wasting our time and whoever that supposed insider was should be added to the trolls list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
MSD Metagem change from 50% -&gt; 20% is also in the &quot;fake&quot; patchnotes. This change is currently live on the PTR 2.4. Please note that Boubouille specifically mentioned several times that the list is not a patchnote list, it is a ToTest-List for PTR2.4. So far, it seems that there's absolutely nothing contradicting him.<br />
<br />
If he is right, then we'll see more and more of those items being tested on the PTR. Maybe not all of them, it's not a list saying what will be there, just what they like to test out. It's too early of crying them fake. It has been said, again, that the things on the list are not going to be there on day 1 on PTR. That is true. Yet some of these &quot;fake&quot; changes are there now. So let's just wait, ok ?</div></div><hr />

Naj'enthus hard? Are you kidding me? Most serious raiding guilds killed him with less than 25 since some people missed either Vashj or Kael. It is kinda funny that you accuse other people of &quot;sucking&quot; when your guild is like 8 months behind. Did you even kill Kael before they nerfed him to the ground? Talk about free attunements... So why should we &quot;recognize&quot; your bosskills? Not like the first bosses in BT or MH are any hard really. Kael was signifcantly harder before the nerfs.</div></div><hr />

pfft... there are NO reason you get access to a higher level dungeon without a attunement that proves that YOU and your ENTIRE RAID GROUP is GOOD ENOUGH to do the content in the said instance.<br />

But the casual whiners with tears in their eyes couldn't handle the fact they suck , and kept crying to blizzard gave them access to content they cannot do anyway. <br />
Atleast Naj'enthus is hard, so they get access to watch 50 yard of content in Black Temple, and a ride around in Hyjal Summit, watching empty content.<br />

I'll never EVER recognize any bosskills in MH/BT from players who haven't done Kael'thas. I'll take them as Ragnaros kills form a raid full of level 70s.<br />

If you ever considered how many guild that done Voidreaver , Lurker and perhaps Morogrim, that NEVER EVER killed Magtheridon because he was &quot;to hard&quot;.<br />

So there are two options, either they are not good enough to contend in which case they wipe a lot so what does that matter to you, or they are good enough to contend in which case you don't have a leg to stand on.

<br />
players who are geared and know how to play in team can down in less than 25, others that never killed maggye because they cant touch the 5 cubes at the same time(by example), and have less gear because dont clean ssc/tk maybe wont, and if kael is so nerfed remove attunements its stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never met someone who is so obsessed with the time they spent in an instance that they want to make it harder for recruits to apply for guilds. Heres a hint, you are not hardcore, you did not fight Mother Shahraz before they nerfed her, and you have yet to see illidan, what you do now isnt special in anyway and never will be, you alone have NOTHING to complain about compared to other guilds. These changes are implemented so that more people can view the content to them, be happy finding recruits will become easier.<br />
<br />
I grinded rank 14 back when it was a terrible grind, I got my champion of the naruu title long before I ever even SAW nightbane (pre-nerf to heroics, back when epic tanks lost hp in chunks like they were tanking a boss in SSC) these changes are made so that people can enjoy the game more readily then they can now, what you are doing takes no amount of skill but only a measure of time just like every other grind this game has implemented. Time is running out because of the impending expansion and blizzard wishes to see more people experience the content they worked so hard on.<br />
<br />
Your raid isnt filled with some group of hot shot players who are among the few in the world who are only capable of clearing BT, going by the arena ratings of yourself and your guild you are just some delusional pve player who thinks that spending lots of time in raids makes them innately good at this game. News flash buddy, you are as good as all these casual whiners you talk about complaining they suck, you just have more time to throw into a boss to learn the coordination of the fight. Blizzard is now allowing the amount of time to get up and running into an instance alot easier for new characters so they dont have to backflag through instances, casual players will now have a better shot at gearing up to become raid-capable so that they can see the content they want to, and if need be waste the time they want to keep up to par with the rest of the games content. The game restricts way to many people from doing this content because it requires to much time and effort on their part.<br />
<br />
So they made it easier and you had to grind through a flawed system, when old players who first acheived rank 14 got their weapons before they were buffed the response blizzard threw at them was &quot;tough luck&quot;, this is the exact same thing except what they are doing is beneficial to you if you ever feel like gearing up an alt, stop your whining and realize that this game will now be open to people who wish to enter into the race mid game. <br />
<br />
Raiding isnt some sport unless your are competing for world firsts or server firsts, your guild is not on this level.<br />

<br />
<br />
100 marks multiplied by 4 possible battleground marks for 305 honor per hand in at one mark each results in 30k honor? Something is wrong with your maths my friend. It's 122k honor, I'm guessing S2 gear will have an increase in honor needed to reflect this (going to go check this on PTR and report back).<br />
<br />
*agreed 100% with Terg* For someone who finally caved into playing WoW only a little over a year ago, catching up with the bad boys of raiding is tough when it feels like part of your guild would rather run Kara endlessly. Frustrating though when you feel difficulty is perfectly tuned, but due to being 3 months behind everyone else, you have to suffer through easy mode.<br />
<br />
*Edit: Well I'm unsure why but Gladiator's set has been exchanged with some nerfed Glad set under the guise of Grand Marshall a blue set. Increased honor requirements as well. No signs of S2 in Champions' Hall either. No mention of this on the front page, here's the screen caps:<br />

vvv Not sure what you're referring to...*<br />

*Edit2: vvv Oh yeah I see now, pvp token hand in requires all 4 tokens, not 1 of any as I presumed. Thanks for the heads up, mind being a bit less cryptic next time?*</div></div><hr />

Something is wrong with your maths my friend. It's 122k honor, I'm guessing S2 gear will have an increase in honor needed to reflect this (going to go check this on PTR and report back).<br />
<br />
*agreed 100% with Terg* For someone who finally caved into playing WoW only a little over a year ago, catching up with the bad boys of raiding is tough when it feels like part of your guild would rather run Kara endlessly.<br />

<br />
he never said that the first mh/bt bosses were hard(i don't think naj is hard in a bt-way but he IS much harder than many previous bosses - once again be reminded that different raids/guilds have different problems with different bosses. kael and vashj are harder than most other bosses on that level.<br />
<br />
i always thought this means: you kill the hard end-bosses (vashj, kael, mag) and then get a bit of free loot(like patch- grobb) to gear up and get a feeling for the new items(there's a lot of stuff the first bosses drop, and you usually gotta kill them very often to get the cool stuff for everyone - caster offhand, boots and so on).<br />
<br />
and i agree that it's not fair to the raiders who HAD to do the content and spend so much time to get there that now everyone is just walking in there and killing the first guy. no they're not hard. yes, they give good loot. <br />
if you spent so much time getting there, you don't think it's fair that now everyone is allowed to do the same. i think windcape overdid it a bit but all in all, he's right somewhere. if you uh...like... spent the last 10 years saving money for your car and then you hear in the news: they're selling the same cars for 30%, you think it's not fair. you think you could have waited till now and done something else with all the money you've been saving and working so hard for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
but keeping the analogy, even though you payed more you had it first, and gained that recognition of having the car before anyone else. and after a few years (or in this case months) everyone else is driving the same car and it is no longer special. and from the time you bought your first car you have been saving up to buy the next model as soon as it comes out, most likely while everyone else is still driving the now 'old' car and even if they pay less for that same model months later, the cycle will continue where you always have it first.<br />
<br />
play that back into WoW how you will, but it will always require more effort to get something done early in terms of progression.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azain</div><div class="date">2008-02-11, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the reason a lot of things get nerfed is because it is truly an MMO. short of making it like a job or your life and playing 12-15 hours a day (or more for some people i'm sure) you simply cannot do everything. so in that sense what you did do made you unique, gave you some stature in that you were one a few people on a server or a battlegroup to actually do it. <br />
<br />
that is a fine idea until people leave the game because it simply requires too much time to do things. things like attunements long after they have no purpose of testing real guilds, and frostsabers when 40 epic land mounts exist and not everyone is going to run off clamoring for a tiger. like some people said removing attunements won't matter, its just a new set of content that casuals and sub-par pve players will get to wipe on. it's certainly not going to ruin the game by letting some players see content before it goes into the archives. <br />
<br />
if you want to actually see a reward for your time put in get a job, make some money, do something irl. i'm not sure if i can even help you find solace given your reaction to 2.4, but like most other people, i fail to see what is the big deal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciadia</div><div class="date">2008-02-11, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being in a endgame raiding guild (#1 in progress on the server), i find some of the myths being told in here pretty funny.<br />
<br />
You don't need to spend _that_ much time to clear bt, we use about 2-3 days to clear both bt/hyjal, and thats with raiding from 19:00-23:00. Thats without having to farm mats for flasks (and other reagents) etc, i even earn gold at the current stage just by raiding, since flasks really only was needed in the very beginning of the progression raids.<br />
<br />
That said, iam personally in favor of removing the atunements, it will make recruitment so incredible much easier, since you don't have to either clear, or buy a semi cleared instance just to atune new people (since at the current stage, alot decides to quit wow it seems!), and going back to the hell of ssc/tk after having farmed Illidan for months just plain sucks, no one is focusing during thoose raid etc.<br />
<br />
And iam happy that my friends in other guilds on the server, that only very recently progressed into bt/hyjal, get a chance to experience the instances (although i incredible hate hyjal, its design is just so poor in any imaginable way). Most of them are very aware they are not &quot;experiencing&quot; how hard the instances was when we first cleared them, even with nerfs an instance like bt is a really very well made instance (sure not as good as naxx, but still), with hours of fun to be had.<br />
<br />
The top guilds are focusing on sunwell anyway, and i don't really care that other can farm the first 3 bosses in bt not having killed vashj/kael'thas, if anything they get more for their money.<br />
<br />
What i _DO_ mind though is that kara geared people can start farming SP trash for some of the best items (fx the tailoring chest), such recipes / items should really only drop after you atleast cleared the 1st boss in the instance, on the trash after that. This is after all the top tier of a raiding instance, iam all for opening up previous tiers to get more people to experience them as stated above though, hell i don't mind them overly nerfing previous tiers just to let people experience &quot;some&quot; of the feel of the fights.<br />
<br />
What i personally would like isnt really much, just a simple tittle for having killed archi+illidan. And going forward, for having killed KJ. I don't care about a title for having done a silly atunement quest. (yes i don't have the whatnot of naaru title, and yes i actually have cleared all content required for the title long ago,just didn't have the quest). What i want is a title for showing hey this person has cleared the end boss.<br />
<br />
Getting easy items from badge items is well and fine, if raiding persons want it, they can just repeat what the more casual do to get same items. I personally think the arena season items are fine with the exception of weapons, make them with alot more pvp oriented stats for thoose that actually pvp (i don't give a rats ass for pvp, and never will myself).<br />
<br />
I personally hope they add more tokenized stuff, having killed archi for fuck knows how many times, ending up with utter useless items nearly every kill, just plain sucks. (yes my weapon is _lol_ iam very aware but nothing you can do about randomness!, and no i wont farm the decent arena s3 weapon just well beacuse i severely hate pvp in any form).<br />
<br />
Adding more tokens for set gear is all great, but the randomness of non token items can really fuck some classes over. Iam not saying it should be easy and predictable when you get a item, just that theres should be a better chance someone in the raid can actually use whatever drops, hell close some offspecs have better gear than some main spec has at the current stage.</div></div><hr />

Great now all instance runs will take a half an hour longer so that some arena battles can be 10 minutes shorter. Other than being a lot slower for all instances it will make Black Morass a good deal harder. Since thats about the only attunement left in the game thats a bit harsh :)</div></div><hr />
