As far as I know Essence of Soul, Mother Shahraz, The Illidari Council and Illidan were not tested on the PTR's by any guild.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Essence of souls has been killed A LOT of times, this is why I could get the whole loot table, but I don't know if it was GM or players kills, I doubt that Curse or Nihilum killed and decided to stay silent about it.<br />
<br />
Same for the Illidari Council, managed to get the Madness of the Betrayer on the PTR, dont know if it was a GM or a player kill.</div></div><hr />
