The Real ID Party feature is now officially live and remains free, hurray!<br />
We’re happy to announce that the testing period for World of Warcraft's new Real ID Party system is now complete, and the feature is now officially live! We received a lot of great feedback from the community throughout the course of our testing, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to share their thoughts and experiences with us.<br />
<br />
For those who haven't yet had a chance to try it out, the Real ID Party system allows players to invite Real ID friends of the same faction to a 5-player normal or Heroic dungeon, regardless of what realm their friends are on. This new feature makes it easier than ever for real-life friends to play together, and it's available to all World of Warcraft players at no additional charge -- all you need to do is have Real ID enabled.<br />
<br />
To learn more about Real ID, visit the Real ID web page and read the FAQ.<br />
<br />
For more information about how the Real ID Party system works, check out the FAQ below, updated with a couple new questions that came up during the testing period.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I invite Real ID friends to a Real ID Party?<br />
A: Inviting a Real ID friend to a Real ID Party is simple. Just open up your friends list to see which Real ID friends are online. Click on the “Plus” button to send an invitation to a Real ID friend to join your group. You can continue to add Real ID friends to your party until the group is complete. If you cannot complete the group with Real ID friends, you are free to join the Dungeon Finder to fill in the missing roles. <br />
<br />
Q: Does a player need to have Real ID enabled to accept a Real ID group invite?<br />
A: Yes, a player must have Real ID enabled, and both players must be Real ID friends to accept or initiate Real ID party invitations.<br />
<br />
Q: Can a party leader invite a mix of Real ID friends, character-level friends, guildmates, or random players to the same party?<br />
A: A party leader can invite any combination of Real ID friends from any realm, guildmates from the same realm, or other characters from the same realm to the same party. If the party leader isn’t able to fill up the entire party, the Dungeon Finder can fill in the missing roles.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I invite someone who is not a Real ID friend?<br />
A: You can only invite members to a party if they are on your Real ID friends list or if they are on the same realm as you are.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I invite a friend of a Real ID friend?<br />
A: No, you can only invite your own Real ID friends the party.<br />
<br />
Q. Are you considering expanding the system to work with raids, Battlegrounds, Arenas, or to allow cross-faction play?<br />
A: We're always looking into ways to improve features like this to make it more convenient for real-life friends to play together. However, we don't have any further announcements to share at this time.<br />
<br />
Q: Will any future aspects of the Real ID Party system be premium-based?<br />
A: It's always possible that we'll add features and functionality that could have a premium component, but we don't have any specific details to share at this time.</div></div><hr />

Also, such decisions may in the long run actually get me to play again, even if I never wanted to, if I get interested in the game in general once again. Adding premium stuff besides cosmetic crap will keep me away though.</div></div><hr />

no, blizz just does this type of shit all the time.<br />
same goes for always online for D3, they're going to announce at blizzcon that hardcore mode will be offlilne and add a new mode that you can copy &quot;always online&quot; char into but never vice versa.<br />
in other words they lied to you, &quot;there is no cake left, here have some free cake&quot;.<br />
a lie your happy about, but a lie none the less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see where they admitted a mistake? They didn't. They just fixed their mistake. The thing is, Blizzard can't publicly address mistakes anymore. There are too many viable competitors and Blizzard isn't pushing its own productivity. Nickling and diming us on features that SHOULD be free won't help them keep subs up when they've already lost 1/12 of their subscriber base in less than 6 months.<br />
<br />
This isn't so much them admitting mistakes as much as them realizing they can't screw around anymore if they want to stop bleeding subs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since Blizzard never said what about this feature would be would be premium based (all they said was aspects of it would be, which remains true if you read the announcement), we will never know if Blizz change their minds or if it was always going to be this way.<br />
<br />
And the RealID thing getting changed had nothing to do with the community complaining and a whole hell of a lot to do with the fact that it would have played really fast and loose with ton of privacy laws all over the world. Attorneys killed ReadID, not the community.</div></div><hr />

About this; well I suppose it's cool. I guess they made it free, because noone really uses the readID system? Maybe I just don't use the realID system ;-)</div></div><hr />

Most players don't read MMO-C, or the Wow blog. They just log in, and play.Most of the &quot;900,000&quot; players who quit, quit because they were bored of the game. This feature is useless for me, and the premium service was not the reason I quit.<br />

Agreed. It's fine to feel good about the feature becoming free after all, but remember that 'after all' part. There was a point where they wanted to charge for this (or an aspect of this system). And yeah, I think the outcry from the fans helped change a few minds there.</div></div><hr />

I never forgot, and it is a good thing they didn't try that premium service deal out, they probably saw the loss and subs, and the discouraging rants from players. that probably made them think twice, paying 15$ a month should already and always make us a premium payer to begin with.</div></div><hr />

If a free t-shirt doesn't match my eyes or isn't the right size, you best believe I'm starting some shit, lol, I don't care how free it is. <br />
Sure, maybe it wouldn't matter if I don't intend to ever actually wear the damn thing, but that's a whole 'nother factor.<br />

There's an apt analogy in there somewhere, but it's too early for me to figure it out... lol<br />

Ofc the premium feature had nothing to do with the 300k, but Blizzard now really needs everything to keep the rest of the subscribers. Giving it away for free (&quot;for free&quot;) it's a nice new feature to keep people interested, while making it yet another premium-based product could have pushed the players in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />

Yes but as someone else, and I, stated before, it would completely negate the choice of realm transfers, giving Blizzard no other option than to make it premium based. Company's don't want to lose potential money no matter who they are.</div></div><hr />

I doubt bitching had anything to do with Blizzard's decision on -this- feature. They never said it was definitely going to be a pay feature. They said it might be a pay feature. <br />
<br />
I completely agree on the original ReadID issue. It was definitely customer complaints that led them to no implement that crap.<br />

Rather than an occasional few $$$ for a transfer, they would be getting a steady monthly extra from many more people.</div></div><hr />

They never said it was definitely going to be a pay feature. They said it might be a pay feature. <br />
<br />
I completely agree on the original ReadID issue. It was definitely customer complaints that led them to no implement that crap.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
What I think is funny is how many people were outraged, outraged, I say at the possibility of a feature most of 'em won't use being a pay feature.<br />
<br />
I was outraged at them charging for a feature that affects gameplay, because I've paid for FOUR copies of the game from vanilla to Cata, and two subscription fees for over 3 years, and I figure that should make me eligible for gameplay features.<br />
<br />
This is exactly comparable to them charging extra for LFD, or cross-region BGs.<br />
<br />
WoW is not a micropayment game. If you want to nickle and dime, stop charging $50 for expansions. Stop charging $15 per month. You can't do BOTH subscription and micropayments with a straight face, not even if you're Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Call me an idealist, but perhps I can really just envision the possibility of a company that understands that caring about its customers -is- what gives them the best bottom line, rather than caring about only the bottom line period.</div></div><hr />

A moment later it just leaves me thinking how important good education is, and how much humanity as a whole is still lacking it. <br />
<br />
Think thoroughly about how a business works, how it's structured, what kind of person works in what position. There are, no doubt, a lot of people working at Blizzard who just want to make the game the best for everyone, and would happily share anything cool without charging extra for it. This people have nothing to say though, they work for the company and do as they are told. The decision makers are totally different people though. Look at Bobby Kottick for example. Does that guy look like someone who is interested in you having a good time in the game, that you get the most out of your money? He's a business man, that's why he makes decisions. Not because he likes to see you smiling more and more for constantly 15$/month. He wants you to smile more for paying more and more over time. That's what makes the share holders happy, and their smile is worth so much more than yours, it's comparable to how much more the smile of your child is worth to you compared to the well beeing of an amoeba at the most far point possible away from you. And that still may not cut it. <br />
<br />
In todays upcoming switch to premium services in the gaming industry, a decision like the one at hand has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the desire of people to give you something for free. At the least, such is done to lure you into paying for things in the future. In the case of cross realm grouping, I would guess it has to do with declining subscriptions and the massive uproar when they first said something about that it will/may/could/bla be premium. Also, be aware that sometimes a small, effective trick is used to controll big masses of people, to influence their views and decision making, their perception of actions. <br />
<br />
1) Announce outrageous, unimaginable change. <br />
2) Let there be rage. <br />
3) Wait some time, possibly let the masses test the changes. <br />
4) Declare it as a mistake, announce that the outrageous part was never intended and harsh actions are taken against the person who is responsible for it. <br />
5) Release just the unimaginable part. Still vomit excuse after excuse and bow to the dust because of the outrageous stuff. <br />
6) Bath in the warm love of the masses. <br />
7) Open the champagne at the office. You successfuly released stuff you would have been beheaded for a few weeks ago. <br />
<br />
Or in short: Tell a person you will cut of her hand. Wait. Cut off only one finger. Be perceived as someone with the biggest of hearts. <br />
<br />
This is an old trick, and of course you could see it in every reversed change if you want to. I don't want to say it's done often, but if you look closely, sometimes it's rather obvious. <br />
<br />
Always question what people with power do. Never think just because the end product is about fun that there isn't someone with power at the top of it that trys to get every last unit of currency out of your wallet. By every means possible.</div></div><hr />

And yes, i am aware that the main purpose of blizzard is make money, its a company, they gotta be profitable or else they would go bankrupt. I wasnt neither in favor or against the Real ID premium thing, but i am glad that its goin to be for free. Also, i dont get why so many people go nuts over the fact that blizzard is adding something in the store, as long as it doesnt affect your gameplay because &quot;XXXX&quot; player has it then you shouldnt care, and &quot;If you dont want it then just dont buy it&quot;</div></div><hr />

There was this &quot;the Exalted&quot; issue also :)<br />
<br />
4. &quot;the Insane&quot; title that was originally going away too<br />
<br />
5. ZG being gone forever, but came back... along with the ZA mount being brought back in some manner as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm glad they decided to change it to being a free feature. Blizzard does listen to the community more often than people actually think or like to believe. That and they never said that it was going to be completely premium, or what even was supposed to be under the premium feature in their blue post announcing it. All they stated was that details were to come at a later date. So really, they didn't really change anything if you look at it like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<br />
It was a trick all along for them to make players feel like they were giving them something included in the standard subscription that they could possibly charge for. Just wait. Now the deluge of premium features begins.</div></div><hr />

I would like to add to that, Blizzard are no doubt feeling an amount of pressure with regards to Rift changing the way MMOs operate - the updates have been coming thick and fast, and services such as cross-realm transfers are completely free. Ironically, it's not the quality of gameplay in Rift that Blizzard are worried about, but how they are showing that selling an MMO isn't just about squeezing every last penny out of it's customers. Good will from the developers creates good will amongst the players (who would have thought that?).</div></div><hr />
