Upcoming World PvP Changes - 11/13/2017<br />
With this week’s maintenance, we’ll be applying some hotfixes intended to slow down damage in world PvP:<br />
<br />
<br />
Non-tank specializations now take 40% less damage from enemy players while engaged in world PvP We have reduced the PvP effectiveness of a number of trinkets and Legion Legendaries that contributed to excessive burst damage:<br />
<br />
Draught of Souls now deals 70% less damage to enemy players<br />
Cold Heart now deals 75% less damage to enemy players<br />
Kil’Jaeden’s Burning Wish now deals 60% less damage to enemy players<br />
Insignia of Ravenholdt now deals 50% less damage to enemy players Pillars of Inmost Light now increase Eye of Tyr damage by 150% when attacking players (was 300%)<br />
Scarlet Inquisitor’s Expurgation now increases Divine Storm damage by 3% per stack when attacking players (was 6% per stack)<br />
The Dreadlord’s Deceit now increases the damage of Shuriken Storm by 6% per stack when attacking players (was 25% per stack)<br />
Fiery Red Maimers now increase Maim damage by 165% when attacking players (was 500%)<br />
<br />
<br />
Our intent with these changes is to reduce the amount of initial burst damage dealt by players in world PvP, especially when using certain legendary items or trinkets, giving the player being attacked more opportunity to react. While we want to maintain the “anything goes” nature of world PvP in Legion, we do want you to have at least some chance to retaliate, even when caught by surprise.<br />
<br />
<br />

What would you want them to do? Put a dev in each person's home and put a gun in their heads to FORCE them to world pvp?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but no one gives a f about world pvp, aside of lowlifes who gang low level and lowlifes who attack from behind while you are questing.<br />
<br />
If you want to pvp, there is arenas, both skirmish and rated, bgs, both ranked and unranked. A place where people WANT to pvp. World pvp is dead and it has never been a thing in first place, aside of the year, that there wasn't battlegrounds, quit whining already.</div></div><hr />

Buddy, no matter how good or strong your arguements are, thoose &quot;PVP&quot; players will always whine about it. Believe me when I say, even if blizzar magicly fixes everything to perfection with world pvp, they would STILL whine. You dont believe me? Look at the whine threads when blizzard introduced tarren mill VS south shore for short time. All of a sudden, they wanted blizzard to balance it.</div></div><hr />

They're not deleting it in BfA, they're sharding PVP flagged players together so the choice isn't based purely on server type.<br />
<br />
With the new system they can do things to balance WPVP without having to worry about how that behavior will impact PVE.</div></div><hr />

Yep, tanks becoming worthless in the last PvP thing we where able to do, thanks Blizzard then you wonder why every expansion the shortage of tanks is bigger and bigger, if those are their plans for BFA, i can say It Will be the last expansión tanking for me.<br />

How is calling everyone who enjoys wpvp a low level ganking scumbag any different (by comparison I think care bear is a bit more tame)?. We're not forcing anyone to do world PvP (even on the PvP server I play on I never attack hordes who haven't asked for it). It's actually you people telling us it's not okay to do World PvP and that we're basically Hitler if we do enjoy it.<br />
There's something about the dynamics of world PvP that makes it so much fun and you people will probably never understand it because to you it's simply: wpvp=ganking<br />
It's your loss really.</div></div><hr />

Dunno, he got a point. 100% of my world pvp experience is me getting ganked by a group of horde players while doing WQs, me getting attacked by horde while tanking the rares on Argus. Me getting spit on after a group of players run me over in a couple of seconds. Maybe it's different where you're playing, but for me that's basically my experience with world pvp and a reason why I'm looking forward to BfA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comments like this are the exact reason WPvP needs the love Blizzard is starting to work on for it. The fact that WPvP is mostly only associated with scum ganking lowbies. So glad that Blizzard said the new sharding pvp system could separate high and low level players in zones. The age of ganking lowbies draws to a close and it is about time. Its about time for real WPvP to come back. Can not wait for the PvP sharding.</div></div><hr />

So you enjoy attacking unsuspecting people, who are just minding their own business, rather than face them in a (somewhat) balanced environment, where people actually go to participate in PvP? And you still get offended when people call you a ganking scum? Because that's somehow not exactly what you are? :D<br />

I'm actually glad that Blizzard are doing these changes in BfA.</div></div><hr />

No one breeds pit bulls because pit bulls aren’t a breed. And no one breeds puppies - they breed adult dogs.</div></div><hr />

for me in wpvp there are only 2 possible outcomes: either i can heal through the incoming damage and survive until the attacker gets bored OR i die. there is no chance i will be able to heal through and be able to kill the attacker due to most classes having self heal. <br />

The world now will feel a lot different than instances. We have different damage in the world (PvE), different in world PvP and different in instanced PvP. How is that nice to you???? It screws up with the game and with your characters.<br />
<br />
Also, what is the problem with the fact that sometimes you don't actually have the opportunity to fight back at some wPvP situations? Really what is the problem, you died, you 'll res, you 'll go on with whatever it was that you were doing (if that was PvEing).<br />
<br />
The immersion of this world is not the stupid linear PvE progression and PvE &quot;botting&quot; but also the twists of unexpected situations in this living world that cause you to die due to PvP.<br />
<br />
I have died to rogues many many times, to DKs casting Cold Heart and others... I really didn't feel that they should get punished in wPvP for having fun because of their damage and how much effort they 've put to their characters.<br />
<br />
To sum up, some (actually all) of us died, horribly due to wPvP. And this is fun, both for us (in a more subtle way that I tried to touch above) and for the ones that killed us...<br />
<br />
Keeping adding modifiers here and there, that essentially block us from being able to predict how much damage we will deal is so fucking frustrating. &quot;Your ability does XX% of weapon damage&quot; and please scour through the game forums on whether you are going to see that damage all the time, or at only specific situations. I personally have a hard time to track all of that all the time, in and out of instances. So annoying.<br />

I'm actually glad that Blizzard are doing these changes in BfA.<br />

Legion has been absolutely horrible for WPvp, I hope Blizzard do a good job with the sharding, it could be great.<br />

Comments like this are the exact reason WPvP needs the love Blizzard is starting to work on for it. The fact that WPvP is mostly only associated with scum ganking lowbies.

Its about time for real WPvP to come back. Can not wait for the PvP sharding.<br />

Are you delusional? Battle between guilds? What, you just go outside with your guild, in hope to run onto another guild who went out with the same idea? You have rated battlegrounds for that. Fights over turf or an object? You mean battleground, again? Or do you mean uninstanced battleground such as Halaa or Wintergrasp? Is that your idea, when you talk about WPvP? <br />
<br />
Most of the people that cry about WPvP in Legion, in particular, are petty gankers, who hate the current battlegrounds, because they can't outgear the enemy enough to make themselves feel special by two-shotting people. So they choose to &quot;WPvP&quot; against unsuspecting targets, who (most of the time) can't fight back.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but no one gives a f about world pvp, aside of lowlifes who gang low level and lowlifes who attack from behind while you are questing.<br />
<br />
If you want to pvp, there is arenas, both skirmish and rated, bgs, both ranked and unranked. A place where people WANT to pvp. World pvp is dead and it has never been a thing in first place, aside of the year, that there wasn't battlegrounds, quit whining already.<br />

<br />
I had joined a group on a PvP realm via the group finder for killing the world boss in Suramar, the corpulent demon lady in Felsoul Hold. By coincidence there were about 8-10 healers in the raid, which quickly swelled in size to up around 40 people. As the boss evaporated (Yawn!), another large group/raid of players swooped in on flying mounts and attacked us. We initially lost some people, though that only lasted until our healers woke from their world boss induced snooze. Soon the restorative and holy energies *really* started to flow, and our side turned quasi immortal. Eventually our deeps realized being stunned wasn't a death sentence and they in turn started to crank the mad deeps. Red forces were burninated.<br />
<br />
I only had opportunity to fire off exactly one offensive spell at a fleeing rogue. But it was a HW:Chastise fueled by full raid buffs from a previous M+ run, iLvel 932 + 5x10% extra damage from one of the hpriest legos. And it was a crit. (Sorry rogue, thanks for coming.)<br />

It's not about the ganking itself. On smaller servers like the one I play on (which is an RP-PvP server btw.) you get to know other players and some of them specifically ask for it by grouping up, trying to kill you and camp your corpse. Of course things like that suck if you're a new player but forming your own group with friends to get your revenge makes it all the more fun. Usually these things tend to blow up because you invite more and more players (and so will your enemy) and this way I had the most unique encounters in the game. Also from what would be a lore or RP perspective I just don't want to see Horde players walking around in Elwynn/Dun Morogh unharmed.<br />
I also don't like the idea of having people from different servers on your realm just for the sake of PvP. One of the fun things when it coems open PvP is that you get to know your enemy (it could also ruin larger organised RP-PvP events but those have mostly died out because of the low server population). We even have a &quot;list of grudges&quot; on our Discord which keeps getting updated.</div></div><hr />

Because people who &quot;enjoy&quot; it are almost the same who are complaining about these nerfs. They just enjoy being able to safely one-shot someone thanks to the legendaries and call it pvp.<br />
<br />
He is not wrong about most people not caring about wpvp, because that's the main reason it's basically dead nowadays. People don't care. Even pet battles have more people interested on it...<br />
<br />
I have 0 fun &quot;cold hearting&quot; people around, lol. For me it's just the same as one-shotting mobs for my dailies, which I also have 0 fun and I stop doing it as soon as I don't need the rep or caches or anything else that they create to keep people grinding.<br />
<br />
As some people say, the fun from wpvp comes from the &quot;spontaneous and entertaining&quot;, and that actually means people fighting back. Just safely one-shoting people (by using legendaries or ganking low level players) doesn't look like that and in the end just make people go away from it instead of thinking that most will keep logging on their mains or looking for people with the same legendaries to stand a chance... killing the wpvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're implying that it's an issue inherent in wpvp but it's really just Legion. Back in WoD/Pandaria etc. it wasn't even an issue (even when most people had ring/cloak legendary it wasn't half as bad as it is now). World Pvp is not dead because it's not fun. It's dead because Blizzard didn't give two shits about it and completely ruined it with their ridiculous legendary shenanigans, not activating templates, number inflation etc.</div></div><hr />

In this matter wpvp is/was always about sustain, the ability to outlast the enemy (that's why rogues are so infamous among dps classes, they either win by control or vanish). Tanks are OP, because they reduce incoming dmg to their output dmg (or even lower), add some self-healing and the tank wins against a dps. Dps lacks sustain.<br />
<br />
Now most of the players in wpvp are dps (simply because most players play dps specs), so when a tank or a healer hurts their pride by killing them in 1v1, regardless the dps attacked first, they come to the forums and whine.<br />
<br />
After the &quot;fix&quot; dps players will still come to whine to forums, but now because of the healers. Healers are going to have tank level sustain along with their healing output. Especially instant heal specs will be the target of whining now.</div></div><hr />

- With the legion being defeated ( their boss imprisoned and argus not ressing them anymore). Will the draenei go back and reclaim more of there old world?<br />
- Are looking to extent the random debuffs of the Mythic+ dungeons to lower difficulty's. ( like in starcraft )?<br />
- after legion artifacts will get a decent goodbye. But what will this mean for artifacts that have been used very heavy in lore: Aka doomhammer, ashbringer? Will we see thrall etc pick them up again? I would see that as a varian/vol'jin leaving us :'(<br />

<br />
For BFA ( if you can but its a legion question so this is only if you can)<br />
- why these allied races. Both ( and especially the alliance) had ease to create, more lore friendly options.<br />

Cool man, thanks for the pointless distinction that doesn't change anything about what I said. I equate it to people that breed faddish hip-hop culture dogs that like to attack children and other small animals and overpopulate animal shelters.</div></div><hr />

So you enjoy being able to PvP with people and kill them not based on skill alone but on if the RNG gods are good to you?<br />

Seriously to &quot;balance&quot; PvP if you cap the damage output you have a base line for where you can balance PvP and tank PvP.</div></div><hr />

WORLD PVP should have ZERO time spent on making it balanced. Some times you are the baddest fish in the pond, some times you are just a minnow. Balance is why there is instanced pvp. For those try hards that feel they need to prove how &quot;skilled&quot; they are at jumping around in circles.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2017-11-14, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how about you enforce wpvp in the specified wq areas murloc freedom is just ppl flying around looking for naga to kill, brakeneck brawl isn't bad there's usually wpvp going on there<br />
<br />
And how exactly would you enforce pvp on a world quest? It's a chore and making drastic changes to it means it's going to take even longer to finish(hence the mobs to kill). Imagine being there just waiting 10+ minutes for a player to come by and then you expect that player to come back and die to you over over again? Come on dude, you can't be that naive to think that is a &quot;solution&quot;. This game is so unbalanced when it comes to PvP it ain't even fun. You're either demolishing your opponent or getting destroyed yourself, there is barely anything in between.</div></div><hr />

Says who, you? It's not even hard, just many butthurt raiders that need a huge numerical advantage to even bother.<br />
<br />
People would cry too much if this happened now but next expansion they need to go back to legendaries simply not functioning in PvP, they have high stats, that's enough.</div></div><hr />

There are several different ways to pvp in zones already (Random, Arena, Rated BGs, Rated Arena) and they are<br />
a great deal more balanced (not perfectly mind you, some classes are still bullshit) but you have a significantly<br />
better chance of dealing with other players then some schmuck who jumps down in full 950 ilvl gear with the<br />

That right there, doesn't encourage world pvp. You want to balance it, you need to make the fighting fair. I<br />
don't want to fight people I have a 0% chance of beating. You tell me I have a 50%, the least being a 45%<br />
chance? Now you have my attention.</div></div><hr />

You sound like a whining chimp who lies to itself that every player who kills it is probably a 950 (lol) guy with the best legendaries so the chimp doesnt feel bad about being trash at the game. You are the kind of people who will never enable PvP in BfA no matter how balanced it is. What the chimps want is having the same ammount of stats and shit with their shit gear as someone with high-end. Thats retarded of course and they misunderstand what Blizzard wants with this change which is good geared players not being able to oneshot other good geared people.</div></div><hr />

First of all I'am glad that they're actually taking some steps towards fixing world pvp (which makes me believe that pvp toggle in BfA isn't just a way to get rid of world pvp entirely) Then there is this: &quot;While we want to maintain the “anything goes” nature of world PvP in Legion, we do want you to have at least some chance to retaliate, even when caught by surprise.&quot; which is total BS, you should read it like: &quot;We know that right now world pvp is a total garbage but it's sorta too late to actually fix it, the best we can do is this quick and cheap change so it's at least somewhat acceptable&quot; I'am not mad, I just hope it'll get better in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For someone who throws insults around so much, especially the word &quot;chimp&quot;, your reasoning at the end is<br />
unsurprisingly rather &quot;less than human-evolution&quot; (i.e. Chimp-like).<br />
<br />
&quot;Good geared&quot; players are not the only ones getting one-shot. Most people do the towers and other pvp<br />
dailies because they're easy pvp exp that they can do without necessarily being forced to pvp with people.<br />
<br />
Its just another option. Which there's nothing wrong with. However, it is very hard to go about completing<br />
those towers and battles without getting smacked over the head and instantly killed, especially if you're<br />
a fresh lvl 110, or hell, even with an ilvl of over 900 and still getting destroyed by certain classes and<br />
their legendaries? Since not every legendary is even close to being the same in buffing abilities and the<br />
damage they do, its quite unfair. I mean ffs, a Guardian Druid with the right legendaries could take a<br />
whole ten man and not die. That's horribly unbalanced. Its doesn't take a &quot;chimp&quot; to figure that out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Players weren't as overgeared as nowadays so this change wasn't necessary earlier. <br />
As a warrior tank with ilvl 930+ I can easily nuke 2-3 damage dealers at once which wasn't possible with Nighthold gear.</div></div><hr />

no i mean ban flying mounts during murloc freedom/brakeneck brawl in those areas, like they did with black rook rumble, trying to pvp in that area is hard since every1 just sits on their flying m mounts and afks in grps and its even worse when all the mobs are dead and take ages to spawn</div></div><hr />

Seems to me it is the pvpers that spend no time seeking end game gear that want to be able to tear down players that have, and should accordingly be more powerful, that are butthurt and eliciting change. At the end of the day It really will not effect me other than the humor it brings because removing the bonuses and power that I have earned will merely also remove any chance of me flagging so that you can jump around in circles around me flapping your arms wildly demonstrating your uber skill at doing so.<br />

Yeahhhh some people can't get over the fact that oneshotting someone without him having any chance at all is not fun nor is it balanced.<br />

it is easily as fair as being stun locked to death, or even better having a dps player chew right through any tankiness you have built up.</div></div><hr />
