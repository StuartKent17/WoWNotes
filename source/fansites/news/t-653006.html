Patch 3.2 Raid - Enter the Crusaders’ Coliseum<br />
In the next major content patch, the construction of the Crusaders’ Coliseum on the Argent Tournament grounds will be complete, and it will hold new challenges for players. We’d like to share some details on the new dungeon, which represents the next tier of content for the game, but keep in mind that this is still in development and subject to change. The Crusaders’ Coliseum will include:<br />
<br />
New epic 10- and 25-player raid dungeon with five encounters, with each encounter being unlocked one week at a time<br />
A more intuitive structure for harder encounters. This raid dungeon will have four different versions: 10-player, 25-player, 10-player Heroic, and 25-player Heroic, with each one using a separate lockout.<br />
Introduction of the Crusaders’ Tribute! Each of the Heroic mode instances has a new tribute system that will limit players on the number of attempts they get in the Coliseum each week to present a greater challenge for the most battle-hardened heroes. Additional rewards can be earned depending on the number of attempts left in the tribute run each week when the final boss is defeated.<br />
New 5-player dungeon with three encounters that will include Champion’s Seals as each one is defeated<br />
New tier of armor and weapons that are modeled with Alliance- or Horde-specific themes <br />
<br />

<br />
MMO-Champion is now recruiting!<br />
MMO-Champion is recruiting, and this time for real. I'm looking for a few people (2 or 3 at most) to help updating the site and posting news. <br />
<br />
Decent English writing skills.<br />
Autonomy, I won't be always around to tell you what to do. (I hate doing that) <br />
Good knowledge of the game and its mechanics, knowing a few things on how the game works is also a plus. (WDB/DBC Files structures, etc ...)<br />
Basic underestanding of HTML, you don't have to be a web genius (I'm not) but we'll have a problem in our hands if you can't edit my articles.<br />
<br />
And before you ask, yes, this is potentially a paid position. We're not talking about thousands of dollars each month but there is no reason to not pay someone who is useful on the long run. It means that you won't get paid after just one week (except if you do a massive overhaul of everything on the site, maybe) but if you think you can totally steal my job for a few days/weeks every now and then I might have something for you. <br />
<br />
If you want to apply, please <br />
send me a mail (boubouille@mmo-champion.com?subject=[Application] MMO-Champion Writer) with a few information about you, past experiences on other websites, etc ...<br />
<br />
I also need two samples of your work : <br />
A nice recap of all the Patch 3.2 information we already have. You can either choose to post everything in a single news or split it into multiple articles, your choice. <br />
A short review of a popular add-on<br />
<br />
Please do not apply if you can't provide the two samples articles, I usually end up with more than 100 mails as soon as I post a recruitment news and good applications are easily lost in the middle of the less interesting ones. <br />
<br />
Also, I'm always open to offers from designers and developers who think they can add something nice to the site.</div></div><hr />

you do the normal mode to get equipment, first for yourself, then for alts, then only for badges* and after that you do the hard mode of the same bosses (or at least same instance) for achievements and mounts, and on odd days you do the same with a different number of players.<br />
<br />
* I guess there will be a new kind of badges, and either this kind or the Champion's Seals will be used for the heirloom chests, or Seals will drop - maybe for 10man only, maybe 10 drops Conquests, and 25 drops Seals, if that, a lot, since you can get 35 per day already. Would be a toned-down version of the T6-content badge items back then.<br />
Ok probably not like I thought up here, but they will combine the the Coliseum and the Seals somehow...</div></div><hr />

faction-specific tier gear sounds nice, but I'd rather see spec-specific gear, too. Not too great differences, just variations, e.g. stepping more into the three directions of the druid, instead of something generally nature-related.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This makes no sense. They've implemented an new raid instance and added 2 EXTRA heroic versions on top of the normal 10 and 25 man versions. No one will make you do all 4 versions each week if you don't want to - but you can't complain about a lack of variety when EXTRA things have been ADDED, otherwise it sounds like you'd expect them to implement 2 completely new raid instances in one patch?</div></div><hr />

it's clearly an attempt to reuse things to do less work. I would be happy if they added some 1 shot instances like sarth/maly/ony/gruul/mag but they seem to feel the need to make a single really long instances now and then add different modes to it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't expect it to stick, though. The Argent Tournament is, while peaceful, still pronouncing the differences of the factions through, in a fantasy way, sport. Raiding Icecrown might include help from the AC and the EB, but even then, and for future raids again, the loot technically comes from the enemies you've killed, not from the organisator of the tournament.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoting myself here.<br />
<br />
We're only on the second page and you feel the need to bump your spontaneous idea? I don't think they're gonna have different bosses for different modes, there might be random bosses, given the tournament setting, but the base bosses will be the same, while the encounter itself might vary a lot with difficulty (think Vezax, Deconstructor)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Announcer introduces the players and opens their entry gate, players walk in, and gate closes behind them. Perhaps a weak trash wave or two, then first boss, stronger trash wave, second boss, etc.<br />
<br />
Last boss is Black Knight infused with Frost energy and will resemble Arthas encounter.<br />
<br />
failoth: Gay like PVP 60 gay or gay like Paladin T5 gay?<br />

That somehow doesn't make it a tier? <br />

Still though, <br />
<br />
TBC raiding structure was vastly superior to WotLK.<br />
<br />
Kara, Magtheridon, Maulgore/Grull, SSC, TK, Hyjal, BT, SWP, and a tonne of CHALLENGING 5 mans.<br />
Compared to <br />
Easy mode level 60 instance, soloable 5 mans (yes they are that easy), 2 dragons, 1 new raid instance<br />
<br />
<br />
Moar variety neeeeded in WotLK, but at least this is a step in the right direction.<br />
4 &quot;versions&quot; of the same dungeon is laughable tho, and simply a cover up to lack of original raid content.</div></div><hr />

Achievement #2 = killed all 5 bosses in 25m Normal<br />

<br />
1) encourage alt leveling, mount changes, new +xp items etc. 2) make instances easier giving you time to run said alts in a raid lockout 3) put timers on hardmodes so you can't faceroll through them in 4hrs of attempts 4) make multiple lockouts of the same instance to promote going into it multiple times on your main and alts.<br />
<br />
just my opinion but they want people to play the game w/o playing the game as it was previously. i enjoy the game or i should say the concepts and lore, but the gameplay is going out the window. i will continue to play why because its something i've grown used to doing and gives a little down time in the week but its almost not worth the effort to raid if they keep pushing content on us.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, the majority of today's raiders are the casual raiders, which raid 1-2 times a week for a few hours, and of them possibly up to 70% are capable of grasping the concepts within the first few tries. These raiders spend months getting Naxx to clear status in 10 man normal, and probably will never be able to/get to ever clear a Hard version of the raid dungeon. Also, Naxx is the entry raid. All raid dungeons are going to be at LEAST that hard (which is laughably easy if you have a really good group). Haven't done Ulduar yet but I have heard it's more challenging than Naxx, so I am happy for now...<br />
<br />
I estimate that the PTR is two weeks to two months out (if they find massive bugs internally and stall to fix them), based on the general flow of them releasing information to turning out a new PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, our current tiers are just as many pieces as they were :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Teir doesn't always mean teir sets (ie gronnstalker) but a new level of gear. They also said a new teir of weapons and we all tlknow there isn't a teir set for weapons. <br />
<br />
Another example: ZA. It was another teir of loot (loot of another ilvl than previous gear) but still did not contain any sets. <br />
<br />
There's a total of 5 bosses in the raid... So each one will have drop a piece of tier loot. No it won't because t9 is being released with Icecrown Citadel like planned.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inpariswithyou</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, here's a crazy thought.<br />
<br />
The blue post says &quot;with each encounter being unlocked one week at a time,&quot; and everyone has just assumed that this means a single encounter will be available each week. But perhaps this suggests something more akin to the way that the Shattered Sun Offensive was released to us... in stages, but once a stage is unlocked, it is available indefinitely.<br />
<br />
So Week #1 of 3.2 would give us Boss A. During Week #2, we'd get Boss B, but we'd still be able to kill Boss A, and so on, until after five weeks, the Coliseum is a five-boss place every week...<br />
<br />
My question, though, is why specify a regular and a heroic mode for 10- and 25-man. I mean, don't we already have that, unofficially, with the hard modes of specific bosses? I suppose this may be necessary, though, to enable the Tribute system...</div></div><hr />

This prevents Ensidia and the others to finish the whole thing in a week or two, they need to wait 5 weeks after the release to finish it completely.<br />

Blizzard seems to be all about immersion lately, and one of the ways to accomplish that is by making it feel like we are building something over a long period of time. It's what they did with SSO, it's what they're doing currently with the Argent Tournament--&gt;Argent Coliseum, and it'd make sense to do it with the instance.<br />
<br />
This mechanic makes a lot more sense than having one random boss drawn each week out of five. I mean, if they do the one random boss, and this patch does bring a new tier of gear with it (i.e., Tier 9), are they only going to give one person a single tier item out of an entire lockout? Since presumably each boss would drop one type of item, i.e., Boss A drops gloves, Boss B drops helm, etc.<br />
<br />
The random one-out-of-five hearkens back to Zul'gurub days, with its Edge of Madness. Only imagine Zul'gurub having been *just* the Edge of Madness. Most people wouldn't be too thrilled, I don't thinkk.</div></div><hr />

Sunwell only had 6, and how many people cleared that before 3.0?

Oh and just one more thing, Ragnaros was not dificult, he was a grind encounter nothing more. It was al just about the feeling of the Game being new and Fresh and the fact that you worked for so lng to get there but to be honest, most Ulduar encounters are just so much more interesting than (most) of the &quot;Old&quot; Bossesm</div></div><hr />

Most guilds will be doing Ulduar for Val frags for their healers. Having 3 or 4 maces will make adjusting to Icecrown easier.<br />

At least the cockblock this time is limited attempts per lock out. I'm glad to know that my life will not be sacrficed in the name of progression like it has with Ulduar hard modes.</div></div><hr />

I'm a very casual (my guild doesn't even run things at the moment..)When I read the limited attempts thing.. first thing I thought was &quot;Ok? so blizzard can't make hard enough fights to slow down guilds so they have to do it with time restrictions..&quot; in my opinion it doesn't sound like they're making it more challenging but more annoying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Nobody forces you to do the raids<br />
2. Nobody forces you to do ALL 4 OF THEM EVERY WEEK EITHER<br />
3. The limited attemps thingy is good, forces even the biggest geeks to do something besides raiding once in a while. Or they just would do different version of the raid. Oh yea. Could just erase that first part I guess.<br />

<br />
Let's face it: Sarth 3D was ok, because it was one single, optional encounter and your weren't blocking anythin when you hit your head against the wall for hours and hours. Ulduar is far more unforgiving, because only one hardmode is optional and when trying a hardmode you lose time encountering the other bosses, not getting loot you need.<br />

It's entirely possible, and probably likely, that the Argent Arena will be exactly what you all expect; one fight at random a week, four times. The hard modes wont be much harder. Alternatively, Blizzard will have actually learned something, and the Arena's hard mode will wind up being really damn hard. <br />
<br />
People have been suggesting an Arena for years; It all comes down to the implementation. Here's hoping at least one of the fights will be 'Kill seven Ragnaros's at once.' and things like that. Theoretically, it'll be really easy to add new fights to.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc30f676c1c8</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, well it's interesting. I'm slightly confused about the lore aspect of this, because if you think about it who are we going to fight? No one we want to kill is going to be silly/civilised enough to come to an arena on his/her own to fight 25 of us (think about it? The lich king would send his whole might (we're a threat and on his doorstep), the trolls wouldn't leave Zul'drak. The only people, perhaps, are the Vrykul). Also, since the guys giving out the loot are the good guys, they might as well give us it without the competition and so save the world instead of having us win it.<br />
<br />
I'm concerned, due to the size of the arena, that this might just end up being 5 bosses in the same space with no trash, sure quite cute, but no idea for a tier. I seriously hope that it seems like that but then has a twist. For instance, you fight one Vrykul champion in the arena and then the lich king turns up on your doorstep and blasts the arena to shreds before attacking you with waves of minions and you busting out into icecrown glacier defending the argent dawn in some huge battle of lag! Alternatively the floor of the arena could give way forcing you to trek through Nerubian caverns to find a way out. I hope it's more than just ring of blood :( <br />
<br />
Good news is that the non-heroic versions might be on par with Emalon and Archavon rather than Algalon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dukamok</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, here's a crazy thought.<br />
<br />
The blue post says &quot;with each encounter being unlocked one week at a time,&quot; and everyone has just assumed that this means a single encounter will be available each week. But perhaps this suggests something more akin to the way that the Shattered Sun Offensive was released to us... in stages, but once a stage is unlocked, it is available indefinitely.<br />
<br />
So Week #1 of 3.2 would give us Boss A. During Week #2, we'd get Boss B, but we'd still be able to kill Boss A, and so on, until after five weeks, the Coliseum is a five-boss place every week...<br />
<br />
My question, though, is why specify a regular and a heroic mode for 10- and 25-man. I mean, don't we already have that, unofficially, with the hard modes of specific bosses? I suppose this may be necessary, though, to enable the Tribute system...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure this is what they mean... Sunwell style... I hope<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure how to digest all this yet</div></div><hr />

Very nice work Blizz, especially considering a lot of people are still working on Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the Coliseum's bosses will be unlocked in a similar style to the last 3 bosses of SWP, it's nothing we haven't seen before. A limit to number of attempts rather than a timer ala Algalon seems interesting. Personally I don't mind this drip feeding of new content - it prevents a whole patch worth of content, months of developer time, being cleared in 2 days. And let's face it, the top raiding guilds have become so clinical that if a boss is killable, then it's gonna be killed fast.<br />
<br />
Not sure why people are complaining really. There's been much longer gaps between raiding content. Blizz could release new content every week and people would still complain. Btw, only 30 guilds in EU and US have killed Mimiron hard. Hopefully this patch won't come for a couple of months, because my guild certainly isn't done with hard modes yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All you mentioned is already in the game, minus the grindfest - 1 month for casual players to reach max. lvl is not a grindfest, and 1500 quests on release prove you wrong. &lt;3 Besides this, it has everything in a more upgrade, polish and smooth way than WoW ever had or ever will have.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the bones blizzard is throwing at you ... they stopped to dev proper raid instances since they released its going downhill with their game, but like I see the milkmoneycow tactic works as good as on idiots like you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look who's talking, you are the clueless one. Try to actually read aion beta forums, there is no quests past level 30, there is no raids in the game, no pvp, nothing. If you knew NCSoft a little better instead of randomly guessing, you would know it too.<br />

I like this idea. Currently we are holding ourselves up one day a week practicing Hodir and Throrim Hardmodes. Basically this practice means we won't have time to kill Yogg. With the different lockouts we could still clear an Instance and test ourselves at hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

Like....People haven't even had much time to do Hard Modes in Ulduar except the top tier guilds in the world. I GET wanting to make encounters harder, but I was hoping they would be more like Black Temple hard. Where every fight is a no-downs check and you have to pay attention, but it's all very doable with skill as opposed to every fight being like Sunwell where only top tier guilds ever get to see it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, reality check here:<br />
<br />
Inner Sanctum, Fusion, Premonition, Ensidia: They all did some hardmodes, when Ulduar was freshly out. Some did them in the first, or second, or third week. Fusion sucessfully did General V. hardmode weeks before my guild did it. Actually you could say ppl in my guild now have better gear than the Fusion ppl at the time of their Hardmode kill.<br />
<br />
What does that tell me? This is exactly what ppl want: It is about SKILL!!!!!<br />
<br />
BT on the other hand (like SWP and SSC) had GEARCHECK bosses.</div></div><hr />

4 &quot;versions&quot; of the same dungeon is laughable tho, and simply a cover up to lack of original raid content.<br />

<br />
I don't know when you entered the game, but Karazahan was tearfully HARD. King M. and Gruul were SICK as entrylevel raids, don't even start on Magtheridon. Attunements were ok while you progressed in raids, but when 5 core ppl in your guild left and you had to attune ppl with crazy long chains, the fun got old fast. We were deep in BT, bashing our heads on council and suddenly had to shedule weekend raids to killl KT, LV and such.<br />
<br />
Sometimes people just gloryfy the past too much. And yes...I went through all these attunements....several times.../cry.<br />
<br />
Plus: That 1 new raid instance has 14 bosses...we still get colliseum and Icecrown while you include already all Instances from TBC (where SWP was tagged on, with 6 bosses and a gate system - hello Colliseum...you like this in TBC but hate it here?). Icecrown citadel could be massive...we never know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Each of the Heroic mode instances has a new tribute system that will limit players on the number of attempts they get in the Coliseum each week to present a greater challenge for the most battle-hardened heroes.&quot;<br />
<br />
What a load of crap. How does this make things more challenging? Carrot on a fucking stick. Truly pathetic. You guys are ruining this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nerdrage much? I am sure you will be farming Algalon weekly by the release of 3.2 and don't have anything else to do than killing this boss new boss in 2 minutes, then twiddling your thumbs 24/7 in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Too bad you cleverly linked your lv 14 mage in your signatures. There is probery an all powerful lv 80 hidden somewhere behind this (who's achievement we cannot check). ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for design changes - I like them after all. You have much clearer patch of progression and brute forcing hard modes is limited (while pugs can wipe all day on normal modes). This pushes raiding further from &quot;time&quot; to &quot;skill&quot; side which is good.<br />
<br />
Also if 5 man will drop those champion seals it seems that free epics comming for those - so keep doing your daily quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad that my Aion CE arrived today after pre ordering, client is up and running. &lt;3<br />
<br />
<br />
You just shot yourself in the foot syncmaster... Every time you show your face on these boards from this point on I'm going to laugh my ass off at how much you fail, given that you've been going on about how Aion is going to save the universe and kill WOW off etc etc. You've got your Aion now, fuck off and stop posting on these boards, go annoy the Aion community for a change...<br />
<br />
Really looking forward to the 4-way differentiation- now when Hardcores come here and say 'we want challenging content, not optional hard modes', normal players like me can say &quot;you've got the option of running the coliseum in 25 man Heroic if you want a challenge, go run that and don't bitch here as you stand in your normal mode epics&quot;. And anyway, close to zero details have been announced yet and everyone is QQing, which is ridiculous. All the post says is that there will be 5 'encounters'. That could be 5 completely different encounters in 25 man Normal vs Heroic, or it could be a random selection of 5 fights out of 10, or it could just be 5 bosses with harder versions in Heroic. We don't know yet, so pointless QQ is pointless. <br />
<br />
And as for the moaning about the number of bosses, as someone else said, SWP had 6 bosses. BWL had 8. AQ40 had 6 (with 3 extra optionals). SSC had 6. TK had 4. MH had 5. People seem to revere those instances as though they were perfection. Now all of a sudden because people have had 2 Raids with loads of bosses, when they get a 5 encounter Raid and it's like OMFG ONLY 5 BOSSES WTF??!?!?QQQ111! 5 bosses in a Raid has been pretty much standard for much of WOW, why are people bitching?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to hazard a guess and say that the screenshots Blizzard has posted are from the 5-man dungeon.<br />
<br />
I've got a feeling that they have something a little more tricksy up their sleaves for the raid itself. Of course, I could be wrong... but if by 'coliseum,' we're talking giant Roman Coliseum where the entire floor opens up into a colossal maze, or gets filled with water for mock naval battles, then GEIV PLZ.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, now that my disgust has been let loose into the world... <br />
I'm excited. There will be all new stuff to do; there will be new goals to strive for. I've never played a game that updated so often and so frequently with such high quality; and neither have any of you. I'm still very happy to say that for my subscription fee, I get more bang for my buck than I would from any other single game. My shaman friends will be thrilled (they are already); We'll have something worth raiding aside from Ulduar; I'll have a pet that can get me access to a bank/vendor/mailbox once a day or so when I screw up and forget something, like I usually do... I'm full of yay.<br />

<br />
Even though I think this sounds pretty cool, and I love seperate lockouts for hard modes, 5 bosses is a small zone. <br />
<br />
Tier 1: MC had 10. Onyxia had 1.<br />
Tier 2: BWL had 8. <br />
20-mans: ZG had 9 + 1 of 4, but we'll exclude the Alchemy boss and just say 9. AQ20 had 6<br />
Tier 2.5: AQ40 had 9.<br />
Tier 3: Naxxramas (40) had 15.<br />
<br />
Tier 4: Excluding animal bosses, counting Opera as 1, and chess, Karazhan had 10. Magtheridon's Lair had 1 &amp; Gruul's Lair had 2.<br />
Tier 5: SSC had 6, TK had 4.<br />
Tier 6: BT had 9. MH had 5.<br />
Tier 6.5: SWP has 6.<br />
<br />
Tier 7: Naxxramas (25) had 15. OS had 1. EoE had 1. <br />
Tier 8: Ulduar has 14.<br />
VoA: 2.<br />
<br />
Total of 134 bosses in 20 zones averages 6.7 bosses/zone. If you exclude Onyxia, Gruul, Mag &amp; EoE this goes up to 8.1 bosses/zone. Just saying =P.</div></div><hr />

Those guys complaining really need to take a step back and appreciate that not everything in this world is going to be perfectly tailored to you. If you don't like it you don't like it, I don't understand why people feel the need to go on popular forums and emo out.<br />
<br />
I miss the era of the sarcastic gamer :(<br />
<br />
For me, the highlight during levelling during TBC and WotLK was the 'Ring of Blood' events, so basing an instance off it sounds like a good idea. I also like the idea of a troll instance, hopefully they could find time to fit one in, maybe even do a Sunwell style troll instance (in that everyone assumed Black Temple was the end of TBC raid instances).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beo31</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, just curious, did it say anywhere, that the &quot;new tier&quot; of equipment is meant to be an improvement from what is currently dropping in Ulduar or is is just an improvement over the stuff, you get from the Argent Tournament vendors? Also, are the raid-encounters supposed to be the next challenge in PvE-raiding, next to Algalon?<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament, as it is now, is not very challenging and for, I guess, designed for the casual player. So why not continue here and have the new content for the casuals as well? There are not many guilds who have defeated Algalon yet - some not even Yogg-Saron. There is no rush for new Encounters from a casual-perspective. Anyone said, there comes a new, harder, better-loot-included raid-instance with every major content patch? In the past, one major patch included just the never-used-by-me voice-chat.<br />

Sorry for lowering expectations, but until proven wrong, I do not get excited.<br />

OMG PLEASE start thinking. <br />
It's the same as today, but you can progress through hard- and easymode seperatly, instead of beeing blocked when trying a not-optional hardmode like Flameleviathan, XT, Hodir, Thorim, Freya, Mimiron, Vexaz is. This makes the whole hard/normal-mode thing MORE comfortable for everyone. You can farm every week's loot for sure and ADDITIONALLY try hardmodes instead of trying a hardmode and always have to balance time for trying hardmodes and time you need to clear the rest of the dungeon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axio</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope that with teh seperation of Heroic and Normal modes they'll all include different bosses?<br />
That'd give people a reason to run them all.<br />
<br />
I mean, for example:<br />
Normal 10man boss1: Ragnaros<br />
Normal25man boss2: Neferian<br />
Heroic10man boss1: Twin Emps<br />
Heroic25man boss2: Kael'thas(Magisters terrace was merely a setback afterall)<br />
<br />
Anyway, offourse these won't be nthe bosses, but you get what I mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been wishing they would do something like this even with the 10 man / 25 man versions... or at least make the fights different and not just make the 25 man version hit harder and maybe had a few more adds or what not. The 10 man normal/heroic and 25 man normal/heroic could also give you more practice since you can kill them 4 times and get loot from each, at least at first while you are waiting for the rest of the zone to be unlocked.<br />
<br />
Also, what badges are they going to drop? I mean... this fits:<br />
Normal 10man: Heroism<br />
Normal25man: Valor<br />
Heroic10man: Conquest<br />
Heroic25man: (new tokens)<br />
<br />
which would put the normal version on par with Naxx, but hopefully it isn't that easy... idk this is just to many modes for one instance imo.<br />
<br />
Btw, those of you complaining about it taking 5 weeks to do the instance... Sunwell was the same way, so its not the first time they have done it. Its also another way for them to release content to us without it being finished (if they wanted). People are always screaming for content, so they can release this new raid and still have time to tweak and tune the last few bosses while everyone is killing the first one.<br />
<br />
And... just because it says &quot;tier&quot; doesn't mean its the new teir sets...<br />
<br />
ZG has its own &quot;set&quot; which isn't usually included in tier<br />
AQ has its own sets which isn't included in tier<br />
ZA has its own sets which isn't included in tier<br />
<br />
In BC, new raids were added in this order:<br />
<br />
SSC/TK (came w/ xpack), Black Temple / Hyjal, ZA, Sunwell<br />
<br />
In Wotlk...<br />
Naxx (came w/ xpack), Ulduar, Crusader's Coliseum, Icecrown.<br />
<br />
Its nothing new...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's a minimum of 2 months max of 3 imo. They announce things early to get people excited or inform people of what they are working on to give you a glimpse and see your 'constructive' feedback, based on this they will change things also. <br />
<br />
I'm guessing the first boss will be the Black Knight in all versions? And that is when you have mounting duel against him (again), whoever he is, people presume Kael cuz he just doesn't want to die, plus he is a tall character and quite slim, so you'd be expecting a human/nelf/blood elf char.<br />
<br />
As for the last boss? <br />
<br />
-It could be a servant of Arthas?<br />
-It could be an old boss (that we fought before) <br />
-It could be a major alliance or horde lore character in that if you're alliance you fight the horde char, if you're horde you fight the alliance lore char.<br />
<br />
Since they are making 4 versions... And we do not know if these are random encounters like Violet Hold where some bosses are picked on RNG and the last is always the same. We also do not know if the bosses are changed depending on the version also this is an opportunity for Blizzard to gather many old fights in WoW and put them together like Ragnaros, Hogger etc etc, sure they are dead.... but hey let's reanimate them for lvl80!</div></div><hr />

A PvE pacifier, but so long as it stayed a bunch of dailies to be done every day so that in 400 days or so worth of doing them you could buy all the mounts and pets that's fine.

Caverns of Time; there are so many epic events that could be explored the great sundering, the freeing of Alextraza, seige of Stormwind ect. Pick one of these massive awesome lore events with bosses and encounters already written up for you and implement them.<br />
<br />
Azjol-Nerub; Yogg may be not more but that doesn't make the nerubian catacombs any less scary or the faceless onces who patrol the underground any less powerful.<br />
<br />
Grim Batol; with Malygos defeated and the remaining dragon clans united with the kirin tor the time is now to strike down the corrupted aspect Deathwing. Lore has him hold up in Grim Batol under seige by the red dragons. With Yogg dead the influence that twisted his mind and bent his will to turn on his own kind is no more. Justice can finally be done and the countless dragons betrayed finally avenged.<br />
<br />
But no Blizz in there infinite wisdom said &quot;Those encounters while epic and expansive require too much development time. We'll use an arena map remove pillars and reskin a bit and then just have 5 bosses march in that way we don't waste resources with instance design. That's not what players care about anyway, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's true that instance design is an unappreciated art in the WoW culture. Everything is about gear and boss encounters no one cares about the environment. Well I feel that it's wrong to want these hokey &quot;Boss fights for Boss fights sake, lore / aesthetics be damned&quot; approach.<br />
<br />
But that's just me, apparently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont care how many modes you have, you burn out, it gets boring, MORE BLOODY INSTANCES!.<br />
<br />
Naxx, Ulduar, Argent Tournament and Icecrown ? Seirously what a joke. :'(<br />
<br />
<br />
This change was a direct response to World First guilds like Ensidia bitching about the fact that there was no separate lockout on Hard vs Normal modes. That meant some guilds (like Ensidia) were clearing Ulduar completely before trying Hard Modes while others were trying Hard Modes first, or doing a mix of Normal/Hard, so Ensidia lost out on World First Hard Modes in the process. This way you have a choice up-front to try it Hard vs Normal, and by choosing one way you don't prevent yourself from clearing the whole thing in Normal and still chasing for Hard Mode firsts thereafter. It also means all the Hardcores who QQ'd here about normal modes being too easy and Hard Modes too hard can go ahead and clear the thing on Normal and then return and work on the Hard Modes, ensuring that they still get a lockout's worth of Normal gear and can continue to try and progress through bashing their heads against a wall on Hard.<br />
<br />
I really, really can't see why anyone would complain about this system. Blizzard have basically gone &quot;Lets try and give every single raider of every skill level and every level of ambition an option so that everyone is satisfied&quot;, and the response comes back &quot;Waaaaah! Too many options, I'm confused, this will lead to burnout&quot;. Seriously, Blizzard developers can NEVER fucking win.</div></div><hr />

When exactly did blizzard say icecrown citadel raid will be 3.3? I mean the only thing they said as far as I know is that Icecrown and the encounter with the lich king will be the last patch that doesn't mean to be neccesarly 3.3,I mean Classic WoW went to 1.12 and Tbc to 2.4 so tbh I think we can expect some more then this before we fight the mighty lich king ^^.<br />
There's like these imbah zones waiting to get released in old world still (Hyjal,Dûm Batol,That massive closed gate in south tanaris,and much more) who knows the lichking might send some officer of his to there to help find worthy minions to help him in his defense of his citadel(maybe hell try to ressurect archimonde hangin in the world tree atm or look in the mysterious onyxia cavelike entrance in Hyjal) wold love to such such events. ;D<br />
But going of topic here I think ;)<br />
As far as im concerned everything up till now the changes blizzard made or the content where good I have faith in them that this colloseum thing will work out :) cause who didn't love their first time Ring of Blood in Nagrand right? 8)<br />
<br />
Oh and to the people QQing about blizzard ruining the game and they started to hate playing this game,If you hate a game why play it? Go play something else for a while im sure you'll come back saying you missed the game and it wasn't that bad afterall :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Haxxored - While I agree with you that a lore-centric instance would have been nice, I think you underestimate Blizzard. I have my doubts that the Coliseum will simply be a blank arena with a random boss who appears. I may be proved wrong, but I think Blizzard know their players fairly well and know that a simple Arena event won't suffice. I suspect there will be some twists in the tail, that each of the encounters will have a story to tell... I also think you're overlooking the purpose of the Tournament- it does have a role to play in Lore, it's an integral part of the story of WOTLK, of the march towards Icecrown and the Crusade's attempts to unite the Alliance and Horde in opposition to the more brash of the respective leaders. I expect it to further expand the story of Varian vs the Horde- you know he's going to stick his ugly mug in there somehow with all of these Horde and Alliance being brought together and made pally-pally by the Crusade- he's going to want to put a stop to it or generally throw a spanner in the works so he can ramp up the hatred and conflict between the two sides.<br />
<br />
And I think your criticism of the Tournament as a simple timesink is also unfair. It gives non-raiders something to do. It provides people another avenue for gearing up alts for raiding. It's a more entertaining way to earn gold than simply farming mats or grinding mobs. It fits into the story of WOTLK. Not all new content should be instanced, and Tournament is (in my opinion) a well thought out foundation for a major quest hub that will grow as we get closer to Arthas. Ultimately everything in this game is 'just a time sink'- I happen to think this one is an enjoyable one, and without it, given that I only raid 2 nights a week, I'd have had a lot less to do over the last few months.</div></div><hr />

Some people were sick of the place, raidgroup disbanded, but by the time of SWP, still not half of the playerbase had set foot into it.<br />
<br />
Now we finally get something new every few months, definitely an improvement. Maybe all the whiners here have killed Yogg already every week (and will kill him another 12 times to 3.2), but that doesn't change the fact that the majority of the player base is still progressing slowly in Ulduar (meaning that right now 6% have killed Yogg). So even with a relatively small new raid Instance (5 bosses, compareable to SSC and TK with 5-6 bosses each), there is still enough to do outside.<br />
<br />
Only unlike TK and SSC, players will most likely get a boss down every week...in SSC and TK we spend our sweet time (meaning weeks and weeks) on each boss, with Vashj / KT taking the cake.<br />
<br />
The only difference now is that Vashj / KT then were what hardmodes are today.</div></div><hr />

Right from the get go the Coliseum, in my opinion was a blatant and insulting time sink meant solely as a distraction. A PvE pacifier, but so long as it stayed a bunch of dailies to be done every day so that in 400 days or so worth of doing them you could buy all the mounts and pets that's fine. But to throw in the next teir of boss content when there is so many more options available is just plain sad.<br />

<br />
There is no reason at all to have a new VoA boss for 3.2 with things like what this looks like.<br />
<br />
The new raid system really seems to be there for this kind of &quot;VoA&quot; instance only, since it looks like a really fast raid, you'll have plenty of time to do 10, 25, 10H and 25H.<br />
<br />
For the achievements, I guess we won't have the same for each version and I think there will be just a few of them for this raid, probably only the &quot;killed boss X&quot; ones like VoA + the &quot;Crusaders’ Tribute&quot; ones (the new Glory of the Raider?). So, no, we would not have a &quot;heroic 25: killed boss #1&quot; + &quot;normal 25: killed boss #1&quot;, but instead &quot;Normal 25: Killed boss #1&quot;, &quot;Heroic 25: Hard mode from boss #1&quot;. To be honest, I think that the heroic achievements will be only &quot;defeat boss #1 with X or fewer atempts&quot;... just like Sarth 1D, 2D, 3D. Except that the drakes are the atempts and don't looks like we can choose the difficulty level (you do 0D/normal or 3D/heroic, no 1D/half-heroic) with the new raid system.<br />
<br />
Don't know the bosses, but I think that with this &quot;1 new each week&quot; and going for a &quot;story telling&quot; perspective, the Black Knight would be the last one doing the offcial &quot;invinting&quot; to the players for Icecrown Citadel (or he'll just be a kael'thas wannabe as the boss of the 5-man &quot;Argent Terrace&quot;).<br />
<br />
Also I think this will clearly end with the &quot;10 is for the weak, 25 is for the good&quot; initial concept from Blizzard and be finally more of diferent progression lines for the same stuff. 10 for who like 10 ppl groups, 25 for those who prefer 25, both with &quot;walk in the park&quot; and &quot;looks like a challenge&quot; modes. The final tunning for that would be 10 and 25 sharing the same lockout.<br />
<br />
But, well, I do aggree that this system is here now just to make for the lack of &quot;raid content&quot; for this patch. Hope they at least hold on the time frame and do launch it after the same time they did with Ulduar (6 or 5 months?). Because launching it faster isnt catering to casuals (who take longer to clear a patch), but for people who can clear everthing faster.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly all this will be ruined with another PTR &quot;do it here 1st!&quot; festival :( They could really hire a few of the players from the best guilds or the guilds themselves with a NDA for internal testing...</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure Blizzard's people can add 2 more lines of code for the difficulty level.<br />
Actually the difficulty level is called &quot;epic&quot; there is a command line that can activate the &quot;epic&quot; difficulty right now in game.<br />
of course it doesn't do anything, it just says: Dungeon difficulty set to Epic</div></div><hr />

If you're a guild that is working on hard modes (10 or 25) then you can just put the normal version of the instance on your schedule and it'll start off being something quick (1 boss) and eventually get more time consuming.<br />
<br />
If you've killed algalon....then good for you i supose. You can do whatever you want.<br />
<br />
The normal and heroic modes I think is a little bit of a cop out, though it's probably needed for their lockout/attempt gimmick but it does ease up on the pressure. Example:<br />
<br />
Your guild is working on Freya+3 it's a little easier since you only need to factor in the time for Vezax/Yogg at the end of your raid week, but if you're working on Heartbreaker, you need to gage just how much time you can really afford to spend on it before clearing out the rest of the instance in your raid week. <br />
<br />
The heroic instance let's you clear all the bosses on normal, and then work on the hard modes in succession without forcing you to hold off on killing a later boss to work on it. I'm not sure if this makes sense but I think it was their intention.</div></div><hr />

More than likely they will do one of two things. Announce a new dragon portal in Wyrmwrest Keep, or announce that another patch is coming on the heels of this that will include Grim Batol or Uldum (or maybe even a Gundrak raid or something)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
People have said Grim Batol would be the next raid instance about every content patch since release. Not to say I wouldn't enjoy it but let's be real here.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, &quot;Call of the Crusade&quot; doesn't give much room to mess with. I was hoping for a Scarlet raid :-[</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">buck008</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also thinking that this isn't all for 3.2. With a new arena season starting, I can be almost certain that a new VoA boss will be added. They might do another Dragon boss in Wyrmrest as well. Plus, don't sleep on the new 5 man. It may not be progression, but MgT was a lot of fun so there is a precedent for this working. So, 6-7 bosses, a new 5 man, and a couple new quest hubs might hold you over for another 3-4 months until at least the build up to 3.3 starts. I think the first couple weeks might suck when there's only 1-2 bosses to kill, but once it picks up it'll be fine.<br />
<br />
This isn't tier 9. Its not. Don't get your hopes up for it. This is definitely an AQ/ZA type of deal. I'd imagine there will be a drop or two in the heroic 5 man that people will want as well. Since we've called heroic Ulduar 8.5, let's say this is 8.75 and call it a day.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canopus</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update - We're recruiting, see below. <br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 Raid - Enter the Crusaders’ Coliseum<br />
In the next major content patch, the construction of the Crusaders’ Coliseum on the Argent Tournament grounds will be complete, and it will hold new challenges for players. We’d like to share some details on the new dungeon, which represents the next tier of content for the game, but keep in mind that this is still in development and subject to change. The Crusaders’ Coliseum will include:<br />
<br />
New epic 10- and 25-player raid dungeon with five encounters, with each encounter being unlocked one week at a time<br />
A more intuitive structure for harder encounters. This raid dungeon will have four different versions: 10-player, 25-player, 10-player Heroic, and 25-player Heroic, with each one using a separate lockout.<br />
Introduction of the Crusaders’ Tribute! Each of the Heroic mode instances has a new tribute system that will limit players on the number of attempts they get in the Coliseum each week to present a greater challenge for the most battle-hardened heroes. Additional rewards can be earned depending on the number of attempts left in the tribute run each week when the final boss is defeated.<br />
New 5-player dungeon with three encounters that will include Champion’s Seals as each one is defeated<br />
New tier of armor and weapons that are modeled with Alliance- or Horde-specific themes <br />
<br />

<br />
MMO-Champion is now recruiting!<br />
MMO-Champion is recruiting, and this time for real. I'm looking for a few people (2 or 3 at most) to help updating the site and posting news. <br />
<br />
Decent English writing skills.<br />
Autonomy, I won't be always around to tell you what to do. (I hate doing that) <br />
Good knowledge of the game and its mechanics, knowing a few things on how the game works is also a plus. (WDB/DBC Files structures, etc ...)<br />
Basic underestanding of HTML, you don't have to be a web genius (I'm not) but we'll have a problem in our hands if you can't edit my articles.<br />
<br />
And before you ask, yes, this is potentially a paid position. We're not talking about thousands of dollars each month but there is no reason to not pay someone who is useful on the long run. It means that you won't get paid after just one week (except if you do a massive overhaul of everything on the site, maybe) but if you think you can totally steal my job for a few days/weeks every now and then I might have something for you. <br />
<br />
If you want to apply, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:boubouille@mmo-champion.com?subject=[Application] MMO-Champion Writer&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;send me a mail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a few information about you, past experiences on other websites, etc ...<br />
<br />
I also need two samples of your work : <br />
A nice recap of all the Patch 3.2 information we already have. You can either choose to post everything in a single news or split it into multiple articles, your choice. <br />
A short review of a popular add-on<br />
<br />
Please do not apply if you can't provide the two samples articles, I usually end up with more than 100 mails as soon as I post a recruitment news and good applications are easily lost in the middle of the less interesting ones. <br />
<br />
Also, I'm always open to offers from designers and developers who think they can add something nice to the site. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, let's be clear about a few things:<br />
<br />
1) The instance/raid instance is still &quot;under construction&quot;. I should suspect they will go to the original 10-man &quot;normal&quot; and 25-man &quot;heroic&quot; raid instance set up we've been use to. I also possibly suspect a typo. But, who knows?<br />
<br />
2) The &quot;with each encounter being unlocked one week at a time&quot;, does that mean we have to repeat the same raid instance each week for 5 weeks to unlock all the bosses? In other words: <br />
<br />
Week 1, we defeat the first boss... Game over. See you next week.<br />
<br />
Week 2, we come back. Beat the previous boss to open access to 2nd boss. Game over. See you next week.<br />
<br />
Week 3, we come back and defeat the previous 2 bosses to access the 3rd boss. Game over. See you next week.<br />
<br />
Week 4, we come back and defeat the previous 3 bosses to access the 4th boss. Game over. See you next week.<br />
<br />
Week 5, we come back and defeat the previous 4 bosses to access the final boss. Game over. See you next week.<br />
<br />
Week 6, we defeat all 5 bosses. Game over. See you next week.<br />
<br />

With you posting this reqruiting, I was wondering if there will come somebody to check up forums for players who make useless posts like &quot;QQ MOA; Troll; Etc...&quot; or are rude in any way in...i find it very frustrating while trying to read a topic that players just make posts pure because they find the need of being a jerk and comment &quot;L2P&quot; when someone is asking help or advice in a topic.<br />
<br />
Perfect example:<br />
<br />
Popcorn anyone?<br />

&quot;You can't please everyone&quot; there is no truer statement than that, as evidenced by EXACTLY what we're seeing right here.<br />
<br />
Question ONE - for you, yes YOU whiners: You cleared all of Ulduar? You have, right? I'm being generous here and not even mentioning hard modes. Ulduar-10's good enough too. Again - you've cleared Ulduar, right?<br />
<br />
Question TWO - What the hell are you expecting? For the game to shine your shoes? What? You bitch and moan about it not being immediately Icecrown. Come on guys. You really think you stand a chance against Arthas in your T7 gear?<br />
<br />
Love how the bitch and moanfest is directed against what's still in BETA status. Did you parents complain about YOU, when you were still a fetus?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm so it's you who decided who are the 'real' players? Pretty arrogant, but hey that's my opinion and I'm not a real player probably according to your standards (if I knew those).<br />
<br />
People the game is evolving, it tries to cater to a wide audience. I think it is fairly safe to state that there is a maximum of 10 percent hardcore and 10 percent totally not hardcore. The 80 percent in between is the target audience that Blizz would like to see happy. Seeing the growth they have established over the last few years, I'd say they are doing a good job. If the game isn't challenging or fun enough for you just go play something else.</div></div><hr />

That'd give people a reason to run them all.<br />
<br />
I mean, for example:<br />
Normal 10man boss1: Ragnaros<br />
Normal25man boss2: Neferian<br />
Heroic10man boss1: Twin Emps<br />
Heroic25man boss2: Kael'thas(Magisters terrace was merely a setback afterall)<br />
<br />
Anyway, offourse these won't be nthe bosses, but you get what I mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroic25man boss2 &lt; Keal'thas; cause none killed Keal'thas. If they make old Lady Vashj and Keal'thas again, we will have 25 heroic changes in 3.2.2 or 3.3 patch. Nothing will be different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been a hard core raider in WoW since vanilla but haven't been raiding all the much since WotLK launched. I think this is a good change but not because I think I can get some gear without raiding. I really enjoy raiding and don't want to be left out of the fights. <br />
<br />
But anyway this is a good change because it helps raiding guilds in one of the best ways possible. This way a guild can gear up faster and have less people, the geared up people, dropping guild for a 'more progressed guild' because they don't want to spend the time gearing up every new person or be trapped in a certain tier. Also this way you can raid with the people you like rather than just raiding with the best players, for the most part, because they don't always go hand in hand.</div></div><hr />
