Arena and RBG Conquest Change 
In patch 4.1 the amount of Conquest earned for both Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds has been changed to a flat amount regardless of team rating, to 135 and 335 respectively. This change should of course have been in the patch 4.1 notes, but due to a fairly straight forward error, was not included." />

<br />
The current reward now in 4.1 for winning an Arena match is 135 Conquest Points, and for Rated Battlegrounds it's 335 Conquest Points. We're currently evaluating these amounts as we believe they are potentially lower than they need to be, and we'll of course let you know if they need to be changed.</div></div><hr />

The rage is going to be that people at high arena ratings actually have to play arena games now (and jeopardize their rating) instead of just sitting on it like a trophy.

At least I can convert my valor to conquest tho, but wonder if that goes towards the weekly cap? I guess it wouldn't but what about the valor cap?

Actually it's that I don't have time every week to sit down for 6-8 hours to try and cap conquest points with 20-30 wins for 4 of my toons that I like to arena on. Some of us have lives where we don't actually get alot of time each week to play wow!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe for someone who can't even break 1500, 10 wins is a bit much, the old system was 10 games total on the team..so all you had to do was 3 games, and the team do 10.<br />
<br />
Now, it's 10-23 Arenas or 4-9 RBG WINS to get capped. I'm 2700ish in 3s, if I was to play all 23 wins in 3s, with the 66% win rate we have, that's..34-35 games? It took us 69 games on this team to get to 2719, and I have to play half that each week just to get capped. Then let's look at my 2s. 95% win rate, 61 games to 2600. 24 games every week to cap there. Sweet. 69 games took around 8 hours when we farmed up. So 4 hours for 35 games.<br />
<br />
Then RBGs, 9 RBGs, 75% win rate, 12 games, each game is like a 10+ min que time, and usually 15-30 minutes long. Let's just call the average around 30 minutes. Not counting making groups, finding replacements. That's 6 hours of RBGs.<br />
<br />
Pretty annoyed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I see you stating that you don't like doing arenas (8 HOURS PER WEEK DOING NOTHING BUT ARENA, OH GOD, THAT'S MORE THAN AN HOUR PER DAY), while willing to obtain high-level PvP gear. This makes me want to question the reason why you are playing this game.<br />
<br />
2200 isn't that high of a rating even on BG9. My holy paladin and I play casually over the week and it usually ends up being only one or two sessions, not nearly enough to warrant the 20-25 game requirement. Let us enjoy our arena and play as many games as we would like when we like and not be penalized.</div></div><hr />

Never liked the concept of 5 wins, as it seemed too easy and everyone got decked in pvp epics. If you want your pvp gear work for it. And also ppl getting to higher ratings and sitting on it, if you want your title try a bit harder. On my server most high rated teams are in hardcore pve guilds and got gear carried in first week or two to highest ratings, which is unfair. This wont change that much, you can still play 2s and save ur 3s or 5s rating, but at least it will require more effort instead of 10 mins weekly arenas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds really odd that you play on 4 toons and now lack time to do so &quot;because you have a life&quot;. Act accordingly and play with 1-2-3 toons if it interferes with your personal life.<br />
<br />
I think it is a good change. It is not good for the game to win 5 matches per week and get decked in the best PvP gear available. (except T2 weapons).</div></div><hr />

so its 10 games to be capped now, do you ppl find it hard to win 10 games?<br />

yes it will take longer to get your cap for your 5-10 lvl 85s but they dont make the game around pl having that many toons...<br />

<br />
1) This change hugely impacts everyone who does Arenas: it is at least doubling the amount of Arena game wins each player needs to have to get capped each week. If you are below 1500, it now takes 10 wins instead of 5. Blizzard balances your MMR around the idea of a 50% win percentage, meaning they expected you to play 10 games to win 5, capping yourself out. Last expansion, you could /dance or /afk your way through 10 games per week for points; the pre-4.1 change let people cap early if they get lucky (going 5-0), but if you have a lower win percentage you could end up going 5-13 and do more games than last expansion. This new change doubles the amount of games everyone needs to play. Now your &quot;for fun + points&quot; teams will be running an average of 20 games instead of 10, and the upper-crust PvPers could be required to play an average of 40+ games instead of 10. Between the queue times and how long matches can last (at any level), we are talking about a massive, extra drain on your time.<br />
<br />
2) No warning whatsoever. Patch was on the PTR for months, and a fundamental redesign of the Arena system was pushed through like a Congressional earmark on a budget resolution at the 11th hour? Not only that, Blizzard already knows it &quot;may be too low&quot; but they pushed it anyway?<br />
<br />
3) All of this smacks as a back-handed move to push Arena players of all stripes into Rated BGs for Conquest Points - &quot;Hey kids, how about 4 Rated BGs instead of 20 Arena matches?&quot; Instead of, you know, admitting that Rated BGs are a failure due to their overall design, and not the reward structure itself.<br />
<br />
4) The lack of empathy from obvious PvE players who never Arena'd to save their life is just sad. This is the equivalent of them reducing the VP you get from dungeons from 70 to 35 (or 140 to 70), but leaving the weekly cap the same. How would you feel about suddenly needing to run twice as many heroics per week? Oh wait, &quot;it isn't necessary to cap VP each week&quot; so nothing changes, right?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frozen Death Knight</div><div class="date">2011-04-27, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering that I am in full BiS epic gear in PvP, this will not matter to me that much, for the rest of this season. However, as for the rest who are not, and for everyone who is going to PvP the coming seasons, this is just over the top. I mean, how the heck are you going to have time to get 20+ wins in Arena per week when having high rating, especially if you have a busy week, in real life? <br />
<br />
Granted, 5 wins per week may have been too little, and frankly even less if you do rated BGs, too, but why then couldn't they have made the requirement for keeping your rating active a static number, like it was before &quot;Cataclysm&quot;? What I mean by that, is that even if you have capped for the week, you need to have played let's say 10 games for that week, in Arena, to be able to get the extended Conquest Points cap, the next reset. Then it doesn't matter if you have capped, already, since you still need to play those games to keep your extended cap, if you have enough rating for it.</div></div><hr />

This. <br />
The new system wasn't broken and there are so many ways to fix higher rating's problems, which actually apply to what? %0.5 of the arena player community only?<br />
This is not a smart way to solve this at the last second, not smart at all. You have to think about all aspects of the community, you give 7 consecutive valor earning from hcs for casual pve'ers and take away this from pvp'ers?

This is the equivalent of them reducing the VP you get from dungeons from 70 to 35 (or 140 to 70), but leaving the weekly cap the same. How would you feel about suddenly needing to run twice as many heroics per week? Oh wait, &quot;it isn't necessary to cap VP each week&quot; so nothing changes, right?<br />
<br />
I am sorry, but I will never have empathy for anyone, who think they need to reach a cap in the game just because there is a cap.<br />
I have Arena'd and a lot. Hundreds of games per week some times. And not just because of rewards, but because I actually enjoyed the process.<br />
And of course it isn't necessary to cap VP each week.<br />
No caps are mandatory in this game. They are just there to stop the extreme kind of nolifers to outprogress others by miles and then QQ how there is nothing at all to do in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You forgot to read down to the part where I, personally, have to do 23 wins.<br />
<br />
And when I have 4 characters. Yes, it's a bit much. Sure, on my main most weeks I play much more than that, on my alts..not really. But if I don't play 40 games one week, I won't get 3k conquest..if this continues into S10, where I actually need conquest, I will be very upset.<br />
<br />
And yeah, 10 wins is a bit much for your average casual. That's on average, like 20 games, less if you play a decent comp, with good gear, a lot more if you're trying like hpally/rogue, because no one else will play 10 wins with you.<br />

<br />
It is a terrible change, regardless. Sure, doing rated BGs will make it easier to cap, but take note to three important points:<br />
<br />
1: It will still take a lot of time winning all the rated BGs, at high ratings.<br />
<br />
2: The amount of wins required in either Arenas or rated BGs will too be many, especially when considering that you simply do not win 100% of the games, which is actually impossible to begin with, unless you are too good for that current rating (Low ratings, that is.).<br />
<br />
3: You can pretty much forget playing an alt, in PvP, since you will probably not have time to cap for more than one character.<br />
<br />
This is a terrible change to anyone who is a top PvPer and is doing well. You can barely even guarantee that you will be able to cap each week, which is essential if you want to stay on top, when you aren't in BiS gear, which is a huge percentage of the PvP playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also if you're complaining about having to do more fights in higher end arena and never being able to get your points, if you're in a high end rating you...really....don't.....need more gear? You should be sitting on a very large amount of vicious pieces and half the time your comps are just gonna get rolfstomped by the better ones anyway.

If they had gone with the idea that you only need to do 10 games, I would not have complained, since that's the system that was used since Arena got introduced in &quot;TBC&quot;. This, however, is simply just stupid. It penalizes people with alts to such a degree that it's not worth playing more than one character in PvP and it penalizes high rated people who are still gearing up and makes it even uncertain if you can even cap for the week.<br />
<br />
If they don't want people to be able to cap their Conquest Points, why couldn't they have lowered the 3k maximum cap to a lower number, instead? Why couldn't they have made it a requirement to do a certain amount of games to be able to keep their cap, in the bracket? Why penalize a high rated player's Conquest Points income, if they are still gearing up? They could have done a much better job fixing the issues they were set out to do, but instead they created even more problems when the issue was not even big, to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, playing 20+ games at high rating to cap, plus not having a 100% win rating (Which is statistically impossible.), plus having games that can last up to 40 minutes, will make it more than just &quot;some&quot; extra work (Think of it as hours upon hours of playing.). <br />
<br />
Besides, the people at high ratings have always worked harder to get their rating and gear, anyway, so how exactly does your point actually matter, when it's already the case?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well here are my 3 questions:<br />
<br />
1) Why is it so important to hit the conquest points cap every week? What exactly are you in such a hurry to get?<br />
2) Why shouldn't it take longer to get said gear if it's superior?<br />
3) If conquest points mean that much to you, then why not trade in any Justice points and convert them if you don't have the time to grind away in arenas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1: Not everyone is in a guild that can access rated BGs. <br />
<br />
2: Win-loss ratings with pugs in rated BGs is a lot lower than having any decent Arena team.<br />
<br />
3: Winning a BG normally takes longer than winning an Arena game.<br />
<br />
4: It still will take a very long time to cap.<br />
<br />
5: Even if you are in a guild who is doing rated BGs, organizing the event takes a lot of work, and you can't always guarantee success, even if the guild is very organized and the players are experienced (This comes from someone who is from one of the best PvP guilds, on my server.). <br />
<br />
6: Making rated BGs mandatory to play high end PvP, if you only like doing Arena, or vice versa, is plain stupid and removes the choice you have in what you actually want to do. <br />
<br />
7: They already adressed this issue by making teams from the same factions being able to fight each other, in rated BGs.<br />
<br />
8: There are plenty of teams queuing for rated BGs, already, and it doesn't normally take very long to start a match.<br />
<br />

This change isn't even balanced for getting one character capped and considering how Blizzard wanted people to roll alts, to begin with, your argument is redundant, to say the least.</div></div><hr />

Because you're thinking of doing them on the same day. Winning 20 games, assuming 7 days a week means winning 3 games per day. That's not much... at all.<br />
<br />
Mentality, that's what they're trying to change... conquest points shouldn't be able to be capped in just a day and then forgetting about them until the following week.</div></div><hr />

It is very balanced, since it still only takes like 3-5 hours per character even at high ratings (that is if you really deserve being at these ratings) to reach the cap.<br />
And the fact they wanted people to roll alts does not exactly imply they wanted everyone to have each alt 3k rated, clearing all hard modes and achievement point capped.<br />

It is just about chosing priorities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, it's 10-23 Arenas or 4-9 RBG WINS to get capped. I'm 2700ish in 3s, if I was to play all 23 wins in 3s, with the 66% win rate we have, that's..34-35 games? It took us 69 games on this team to get to 2719, and I have to play half that each week just to get capped. Then let's look at my 2s. 95% win rate, 61 games to 2600. 24 games every week to cap there. Sweet. 69 games took around 8 hours when we farmed up. So 4 hours for 35 games.<br />
<br />
Then RBGs, 9 RBGs, 75% win rate, 12 games, each game is like a 10+ min que time, and usually 15-30 minutes long. Let's just call the average around 30 minutes. Not counting making groups, finding replacements. That's 6 hours of RBGs.<br />
<br />
Pretty annoyed.<br />

So basically PVPers now have to put same ammount of time as PVEers to get their points capped? I approve of that.</div></div><hr />

It is as time consuming as someone raiding with 4 toons. So... it's your choice and problem, not theirs. They focus on a player playing a toon, not a player doing the same thing on 3,4,5,6 toons. That way, ppl could ask to lower the number of daily cap, but increase the gold per daily, because they do 25 dailies on 5 toons and it's time consuming...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that PvErs get gold when PvEing, access to a lot more titles, materials for professions, more special mounts, and frankly has it a lot more easier to level the guild and get the perks from the guild system (Many of which are required to do PvE to get.). Until the day PvP can be on par with PvE on at least these things, this argument is pointless (Also, having it easier to get the best PvP gear is a very necessary perk for PvP, and is not something PvErs should bother about. Getting easier access to BiS gear in PvP is so that the gap between the lower and higher bracket in PvP is not going to get too big, which is an important point of keeping the game somewhat balanced.).</div></div><hr />

Grind? Where is the grind in doing something you WANT to do? Wasn't the purpose to go and PLAY arena?<br />
<br />
Weird to pay for a game every month to just play 1h of the thing you love the most to do... <br />
<br />
Sitting on a high rating without actually fight for it looks way more like a false sense of acomplishment...<br />

Its like a team who just want to play 1 match of the championship season (preferably a winning match) and come back only in the next year/season for another winning match and another title... lol.<br />

Why not? As I see it, PvP should be about skill, not gear... Idc if a bad player got epics, the bad player is still bad.<br />

You guys really aren't getting it.<br />
<br />
1) This change hugely impacts everyone who does Arenas: it is at least doubling the amount of Arena game wins each player needs to have to get capped each week. If you are below 1500, it now takes 10 wins instead of 5. Blizzard balances your MMR around the idea of a 50% win percentage, meaning they expected you to play 10 games to win 5, capping yourself out. Last expansion, you could /dance or /afk your way through 10 games per week for points; the pre-4.1 change let people cap early if they get lucky (going 5-0), but if you have a lower win percentage you could end up going 5-13 and do more games than last expansion. This new change doubles the amount of games everyone needs to play. Now your &quot;for fun + points&quot; teams will be running an average of 20 games instead of 10, and the upper-crust PvPers could be required to play an average of 40+ games instead of 10. Between the queue times and how long matches can last (at any level), we are talking about a massive, extra drain on your time.<br />
<br />
2) No warning whatsoever. Patch was on the PTR for months, and a fundamental redesign of the Arena system was pushed through like a Congressional earmark on a budget resolution at the 11th hour? Not only that, Blizzard already knows it &quot;may be too low&quot; but they pushed it anyway?<br />
<br />
3) All of this smacks as a back-handed move to push Arena players of all stripes into Rated BGs for Conquest Points - &quot;Hey kids, how about 4 Rated BGs instead of 20 Arena matches?&quot; Instead of, you know, admitting that Rated BGs are a failure due to their overall design, and not the reward structure itself.<br />
<br />
4) The lack of empathy from obvious PvE players who never Arena'd to save their life is just sad. This is the equivalent of them reducing the VP you get from dungeons from 70 to 35 (or 140 to 70), but leaving the weekly cap the same. How would you feel about suddenly needing to run twice as many heroics per week? Oh wait, &quot;it isn't necessary to cap VP each week&quot; so nothing changes, right?<br />
<br />
Just the fact that you don't get that the queue times won't be the same with ppl actually having to play makes all your argument invalid, sorry. Don't help bashing everyone that don't aggree with you with the &quot;obvious PvE players who never Arena'd&quot;. It's just like you're the &quot;obvious no-skill gimmegimme epics&quot; player.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frozen Death Knight</div><div class="date">2011-04-27, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because you're thinking of doing them on the same day. Winning 20 games, assuming 7 days a week means winning 3 games per day. That's not much... at all.<br />
<br />
Mentality, that's what they're trying to change... conquest points shouldn't be able to be capped in just a day and then forgetting about them until the following week.<br />
<br />
As someone having a 2.7k cap, currently, I need to win approximately 25 games a week in Arena, to reach my cap. That is 2.5 times as many games than what I had to do back in previous expansions. Especially considering that PvPers do not even get access to most of the stuff PvErs do, which I mentioned in an earlier post above, I do not see how it is fair for PvPers needing to put in as much work into getting our gear as a PvEr, while at the same time get much less rewards for it. It is a ridiculous idea and frankly, if this change will be as it is until the next season, I probably need to stop playing altogether, since I will not have time playing that many games just to get BiS gear again, in addition to all the stuff I need to get to enchant and gem it.</div></div><hr />

This is /thread<br />
<br />
New system is BS. I have 3 PVP toon, with decent to nice ratings (main PVP is of course lot higher than the 2nd alt). I have enough skill (not MAD amazing 3k) to enjoy some smart PVP with all of them. But with the new system I will have to win ~20 match with my main and ~15 with the other. That will just take TOO MUCH TIME (yes I have a PVE toon too who raid).<br />
<br />
Arena should be rewarding after QUALITY not quantity. If you want to make gear access harder just had ratings on ALL PIECES (from 1k to 2k, doesn't matter) or force players to make their weekly points with the highest team (you can win 1300pts in RBG/2s/3s/5s, but after that you'll have to play your highest rating to break the base cap)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-04-27, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This. <br />
The new system wasn't broken and there are so many ways to fix higher rating's problems, which actually apply to what? %0.5 of the arena player community only?<br />
This is not a smart way to solve this at the last second, not smart at all. You have to think about all aspects of the community, you give 7 consecutive valor earning from hcs for casual pve'ers and take away this from pvp'ers? Sorry but I can't calculate the logic behind this and with the &quot;we may have fucked it up a bit, it can be too low, we can arrange that later&quot; remark, it just seems worse.<br />
Let the well earned flame come, all the way...<br />
<br />
Explain &quot;give 7 consecutive valor earning from hcs&quot;? What changes from doing 1 heroic per day in the end?<br />
<br />
If you were actually saying that they are now getting 7 valor earnings from only 1 hc... like grabbing all conquests from lest than 1 game per day in a week... lol<br />
<br />

<br />
Well I have to say as a pvper I actually like the change. This whole culture of 5 wins in less than an hour on one evening to get cap and then forget it for another week is just rubbish. Its been far to easy to get decent gear and pretend to be a pvper. Just about everyone does the mandatory 5 wins per week and imo it was spoiling pvp. People should do arena because they enjoy it, where does it say u cant spread out your arena matches over the week? 10 wins is still not alot over a 7 day period and those that lose way more than they win might actually learn some skill in order to get the gear!<br />
<br />
This.<br />
That kind of player actually don't care about pvp, just the epics. So this change, while bad for them, they actually don't care. It's not going to change their lives because they DON'T LIKE PVPing. They do it because they feel they need to do it for extra earnings.<br />
<br />
The same way there are ppl who just want to kill a heroic boss and receive all the loot contained in the game (from all heroics and raids) in one kill and vanish for the week, they just want to log and receive their 5 levels (or 85 levels if it's a new toon) and be done with it, they don't like the PVE part of the game.<br />
<br />
The players who actually enjoy what they do, be it PVP or PVE, suffer from the players who do it for &quot;must get&quot; earnings every week. They suffer from long queues because they want to PVP and most of the players there DON'T want to. Just want the rating to get their free stuff.<br />
<br />
For these kind of players, a entire season (+/- 6 months) is way too much time without new epics. They join a ladder not the win, but to get easy epics. Wich gets to the old point in saying &quot;why the hell you want the gear if you're not going to use it and next season there is another one to grab?&quot;<br />
<br />

BTW does anybody know for certain that valor to conquest conversion will count towards cap? Because if that is the case then people will just do 7 HC's each week and 1 or 2 arena games to hit the cap. So even less people will be doing arena's than before. That is if the valor -&gt; conquest conversion counts towards the cap of course.<br />
<br />
As they've always stated, players who join all the aspects of the game, have bonuses.<br />
<br />
The pvpers who hate pve will work their normal way. pvers who hate pvp will do the same.<br />
<br />
And yes, if you don't feel like capping all your toons, go do some nerfed heroics for valors.<br />
<br />

Well, playing 20+ games at high rating to cap, plus not having a 100% win rating (Which is statistically impossible.), plus having games that can last up to 40 minutes, will make it more than just &quot;some&quot; extra work (Think of it as hours upon hours of playing.). <br />
<br />
Besides, the people at high ratings have always worked harder to get their rating and gear, anyway, so how exactly does your point actually matter, when it's already the case?<br />
<br />
Not that much... not that much... hahaha isn't hard to get a high rating... unless you're talking about the 0.5% (btw, with the system of just playing a few games to not loose your rating, not that much effort to keep the rating huh?).<br />

1: Not everyone is in a guild that can access rated BGs. <br />
<br />
2: Win-loss ratings with pugs in rated BGs is a lot lower than having any decent Arena team.<br />
<br />
3: Winning a BG normally takes longer than winning an Arena game.<br />
<br />
4: It still will take a very long time to cap.<br />
<br />
5: Even if you are in a guild who is doing rated BGs, organizing the event takes a lot of work, and you can't always guarantee success, even if the guild is very organized and the players are experienced (This comes from someone who is from one of the best PvP guilds, on my server.). <br />
<br />
6: Making rated BGs mandatory to play high end PvP, if you only like doing Arena, or vice versa, is plain stupid and removes the choice you have in what you actually want to do. <br />
<br />
7: They already adressed this issue by making teams from the same factions being able to fight each other, in rated BGs.<br />
<br />
8: There are plenty of teams queuing for rated BGs, already, and it doesn't normally take very long to start a match.<br />

This change isn't even balanced for getting one character capped and considering how Blizzard wanted people to roll alts, to begin with, your argument is redundant, to say the least.<br />
<br />
&quot;omg, i have to play for it!&quot; lol... it's all about this post. RBGs take more time and get more points. You just said that arenas take little effort, how can you ask for more points for it???? Makes no sense.<br />
<br />
And remember, they wanted to change the focus of the pvp back to bgs... arenas are dying slowly. They're like 5mans, but rewarding top end raid gear. They're changing it to what they said a long time ago while developing cataclysm. &quot;2/3/5 arenas = 5mans, 10/20/40 man bgs = 10/25/40 man raids, we just don't know yet how to make that work&quot;.

3-5 hours per character, if you include other stuff people do in the game, raid farm afk in capital cities, that's a lot of time, you know some people do stuff out of the game right?<br />
<br />
If you raid farm, you can actually trade your valors for conquest and be capped with it.<br />
<br />
Next excuse?<br />

If you do a lot of stuff out of the game, you shouldn't be going &quot;hardcore&quot; (lol) on all your toons, RIGHT?<br />

They don't give pve stuff trough pvp anymore. Ok, except for trading honor for justice now... most of the guild perks are pve perks, you don't need them to sandb... i mean, arena :)<br />

The meaning of accessing bis pvp gear is to pvp... not to hide after 5 games for the week or just not showing again for the rest of the season.<br />

Bullshit. Someone who only does it for points to get the gear pretty much never reaches the ratings to increase their Conquest Points cap. Mostly, they create a team with some random person, win 5 games, and then repeat the process next week, without bothering about increasing their rating. With this change, these people only need to win a few more games, which isn't a huge penalty, at all.<br />
<br />
The people truly getting penalized here are the real PvPers, who actually bother getting rating to try to stay competitive. They will have to win ridiculously many games just to stay on top, each week, until they are fully geared again.<br />
<br />
Does this mean the current amount of games needed to cap is too little? Sure. However, winning 20+ games at higher ratings is ridiculous and needs to be reduced (Preferably like in previous expansions, when you needed to win 10 games.).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, you don't need to cap with all your toons. You should be enjoying your pvp, not doing it because you need to cap with your 3 toons.<br />
<br />
They balance this game around one player and their time played. Not around time played on each toon. If they give it to players like you, there will be another claming that he pvp with his 10 toons and in two servers (20 total), so the system would be BS because he can't cap with all his 20 toons.<br />
<br />
Again, it's about yourself, not about your alts, if you want to spread your points between all your toons instead of grabbing all of them in one toon, your problem, not theirs. It's like someone in wrath complaining that is hard to keep all his alts on the same boat having to do 10 and 25man versions of the same raids everyweek on 4 or more toons. It's their choice, not a &quot;we must do it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once more, caps are there to prevent, not the be obligatory. If you actually enjoy pvp, nothing will change, if you don't enjoy it, it sucks. And sorry for you if you're the one who don't enjoy it. After all you can just do the &quot;lolololskilllesspve&quot; heroics and finish your conquests then... &quot;even less time consuming doing lolpve&quot;.<br />

The second major point is the time commitment for a lot of people will be a lot higher. That's something they can address by increasing the number of points gained though.<br />
It's not even that they have to jeopardize their rating.<br />
<br />
If you play at an MMR of 3000, the number of teams that get you quick queues are few and far between. So if teams in your MMR range aren't queueing (regardless of how many others are) you will likely be waiting a very long time in between each game, only to face a team 500 MMR below you, and crush it. Sure there's a slight risk in it, but it's mostly tedious.<br />
<br />
Also why the bias towards teams at higher rating? This is absolutely unnecessary and it will distort the rating ladder seeing as there is such a dramatic jump in point cap from 1800 to 2200 MMR. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is that if they want to increase the number of arenas happening, they should do it without bias and simply make the cap 10 wins. Furthermore they could make the cap 10 games regardless of win or loss.<br />
<br />
But this is likely a scheme to get players into Rated BGs. It could very well decrease arena participation, seeing as there are alternatives for conquest cap and Battleground Rating is incredibly easy to get and just as hard to lose.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how you can look at it like this...blizzard has always(this expansion)been about catering to the casual player. Even making the HUGE change for VP that you can do them all in one day instead of once a day. I am a casual player...I rarely play during the week and I grind out stuff on the weekends late at night. I still have 4 85s...I dont raid at all except for 10BH every week and do arenas...2 of my toons are 1900ish rating...2k conquest points to cap per week, then 2 others will need just the 10 wins. This is going to make a huge difference to how much I need to pvp to gear my characters. I love pvp just as much as the next guy, but this is ridiculous. The worst part is, I was actually excited that I was going to actually be able to start getting some valor points on my characters. I would have some time to run heroics and gear my dk for tanking as well as pvping, but now that is not the case...I will be stuck with the limited time I do have trying to max out all of them. Just a douche move by blizzard to do this, especially without warning....most of us found out while doing arenas...&quot;ooo cool man, they added a shiny new countdown time...ooo it has the horde symbol at the end! woot!....wtf 135 points?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Half purple pvp half blue and had a blast. My point is stop being so tunnel visioned on the numbers and actually just play it out. I agree that the cap number might be too low for higher ranked games and imo should have the flat cap structured around those ratings so that at 2k or what ever so that way its still ten wins. Imo , having experienced the new cap it doesn't detract from the game experience at all. If you give it a shot and in a week or so if it still aggravates you, then flame, and I know some will.

&quot;omg, i have to play for it!&quot; lol... it's all about this post. RBGs take more time and get more points. You just said that arenas take little effort, how can you ask for more points for it???? Makes no sense.<br />
<br />
And remember, they wanted to change the focus of the pvp back to bgs... arenas are dying slowly. They're like 5mans, but rewarding top end raid gear. They're changing it to what they said a long time ago while developing cataclysm. &quot;2/3/5 arenas = 5mans, 10/20/40 man bgs = 10/25/40 man raids, we just don't know yet how to make that work&quot;. Now they're working on it.<br />

If you raid farm, you can actually trade your valors for conquest and be capped with it.<br />
<br />
Next excuse?<br />

If you do a lot of stuff out of the game, you shouldn't be going &quot;hardcore&quot; (lol) on all your toons, RIGHT?<br />

They don't give pve stuff trough pvp anymore. Ok, except for trading honor for justice now... most of the guild perks are pve perks, you don't need them to sandb... i mean, arena :)<br />
<br />
The meaning of accessing bis pvp gear is to pvp... not to hide after 5 games for the week or just not showing again for the rest of the season.<br />
<br />
And if i'm not mistaken, you level a guild now trough pvp.<br />
<br />
Yeah, like doing PvE is so much &quot;harder&quot;. *insert sarcasm*<br />
<br />

<br />
I said it is easier winning with an Arena team when the players in it are decent in comparison to being in a rated BG pug, which is the number one option for the majority of the playerbase, when there aren't tons of guilds doing rated BGs... If you actually did rated BGs with a really good guild, that would be a completely different story. In fact, it would be even easier than doing Arenas (Meaning, it would take less time.)... <br />
<br />
Besides, you are taking my post out of context, since I replied to someone who said that this change was to encourage more people to do rated BGs, when in fact it would still be better having an Arena team, since they more than likely do not have access to a very good PvP guild and pugs simply do not have a high success rate to make it easier than doing Arena.<br />
<br />
Arenas are alive and well, still. Same can be said about 5 mans. Not everyone likes BGs and raids and vice versa. They are different playstyles and they offer different kinds of fun, for people. I don't see where you are going with this and what is the actual point, especially when there is no real support of your claim. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Blizzard never gave PvE rewards when PvPing up until this patch, when you can now buy materials for Honour Points (Still isn't close to be on par with what you can get when PvEing.). PvP has had its own rewards since the beginning of the game. <br />
<br />
Also, converting Justice Points to Honour Points and vice versa is only for people who do both parts of the game and is not in need of points to buy certain stuff, and is not really worth using when buying the mats I mentioned, when you in fact lose points when converting.<br />
<br />
Some of them are used for doing PvE, some of them are not (For example, some PvE achievements unlock mounts you simply can not get through PvP.). It is also a fact the PvP guilds level slower than PvE ones, since they have much more rewards, when doing them.<br />
<br />
Well, call it whatever you want, but the same could be said about the rest of the game, in that case.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The meaning of having BiS PvP gear is so that you can PvP on an even level with everyone else, so you can keep staying competitive against your opponents. A person with high rating should not be penalized to the point where only people who have time to win 20+ games a week, while at the same time manage to do everything else required for you to have the best enchants and gems for it. Also, people with alts have the right to do high rating PvP with more than one character, especially when good PvErs have enough time to raid with more than one character, as well. <br />
<br />
I have had BiS gear for a few weeks, now. I still PvP to get high ratings. Now I can focus on actually being competitive, than having to worry about capping each week, which many still need to do. Farming PvP gear is not what makes PvP fun, it is about facing off against your opponents and outplaying them. Gear is only a way to create a gap between players who do not have the same gear and it is frankly much more fun playing against someone with the same gear as yourself, since then you know it wasn't because of lack of gear that you lost/won. This, however, will just make it more time consuming and just widen the gap between players having time to play much more than others, which in itself is not a measure of skill, at all. <br />
<br />
I never said anything to the contrary, either. However, it still doesn't change the fact that PvE guilds have it much, much easier to level up their guilds, while PvPers have fewer options and can not gain as much experience to keep up. It is a simple fact.</div></div><hr />

The change won't force any team too que. People sit at their rating when their glad safe and they already got full PvP epic so why would they que for more useless points? THis change will only force people with alts too play the game more. MORE MONEY TOO BLIZZARD! YAY :DDD<br />

Shit change is shit.<br />
<br />
And no top PvP'ers wont play RBGs all week. RBGs are total fucking bullshit. Seriously don't comment on PvP movies/news when your a dragonslaying Paragon wannabe just go slay some ez dragon instead kk??<br />
<br />
And stop talking about earning your epics. PvP should be skilled based not gear based. Skill matters but so does the gear and therefore everyone should have the same gear when they go into arena. The invetion of conquest balanced PvP since everyone would pretty much fight in the same gear.</div></div><hr />

I haven't been doing arenas since Cata came out (a month+ maybe), so I still have many gear needs. With this new system I'm going to have to get 18 wins to cap out. The old system was just as bad (i.e easy) for points as this one, only you didn't have to actually win anything... you just had to play 10 matches a week. <br />
<br />

<br />
At the lower rating, games often end early on because a weaker geared person gets trained and the team doesn't know how to adapt to it. While at the higher levels games that last for 5+ minutes really are the norm, with better teams taking the game to 15-20 minutes for a decisive game. <br />
<br />
What effect this change will really have is players on high rated 3s or 4s, using 2s to smurf wins to cap. Basically destabilizing that bracket as well.<br />
<br />
Not a good change at all. 10% might have been more reasonable than a flat number, but I still think a mid season change was a very very poor choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are whining not because it's ten games (which would be fine) but because it's 20+ games if your rating is higher than 2k. For someone who arenas on multiple toons such as me, 20wins x 3toons/.6winpercentage (assuming 10mins from queue time to game finish) = 16 hours of arena a week to cap them all. I don't like arenaing as a fucking part-time job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scobbs</div><div class="date">2011-04-27, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys really aren't getting it.<br />
<br />
1) This change hugely impacts everyone who does Arenas: it is at least doubling the amount of Arena game wins each player needs to have to get capped each week. If you are below 1500, it now takes 10 wins instead of 5. Blizzard balances your MMR around the idea of a 50% win percentage, meaning they expected you to play 10 games to win 5, capping yourself out. Last expansion, you could /dance or /afk your way through 10 games per week for points; the pre-4.1 change let people cap early if they get lucky (going 5-0), but if you have a lower win percentage you could end up going 5-13 and do more games than last expansion. This new change doubles the amount of games everyone needs to play. Now your &quot;for fun + points&quot; teams will be running an average of 20 games instead of 10, and the upper-crust PvPers could be required to play an average of 40+ games instead of 10. Between the queue times and how long matches can last (at any level), we are talking about a massive, extra drain on your time.<br />
<br />
2) No warning whatsoever. Patch was on the PTR for months, and a fundamental redesign of the Arena system was pushed through like a Congressional earmark on a budget resolution at the 11th hour? Not only that, Blizzard already knows it &quot;may be too low&quot; but they pushed it anyway?<br />
<br />
3) All of this smacks as a back-handed move to push Arena players of all stripes into Rated BGs for Conquest Points - &quot;Hey kids, how about 4 Rated BGs instead of 20 Arena matches?&quot; Instead of, you know, admitting that Rated BGs are a failure due to their overall design, and not the reward structure itself.<br />
<br />
4) The lack of empathy from obvious PvE players who never Arena'd to save their life is just sad. This is the equivalent of them reducing the VP you get from dungeons from 70 to 35 (or 140 to 70), but leaving the weekly cap the same. How would you feel about suddenly needing to run twice as many heroics per week? Oh wait, &quot;it isn't necessary to cap VP each week&quot; so nothing changes, right?<br />
<br />
Hit all four nails on the head. <br />
<br />
I can't believe this change, especially mid-season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's not the fact that they don't enjoy PvP, it's the fact that they don't want to grind for the same type of rewards that sole PvE players have to endure for their epics. That's why many people went to PvP in Cata due to the fact dungeons and raids are very time consuming again, and are not zergable as in Wrath... It's the extreme lack of paticence that these players have that causes them to rage, because arena battles are not as easy to farm as, say, normal 5-mans or unrated BG's... Plus, there is the rating issue... (lol)<br />
<br />
I say it's fair justice... It's an MMO... Grind is literarly part ofd the franchise anyway... and if you can't accept that, don't play...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azurrei</div><div class="date">2011-04-27, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe for someone who can't even break 1500, 10 wins is a bit much, the old system was 10 games total on the team..so all you had to do was 3 games, and the team do 10.<br />
<br />
Now, it's 10-23 Arenas or 4-9 RBG WINS to get capped. I'm 2700ish in 3s, if I was to play all 23 wins in 3s, with the 66% win rate we have, that's..34-35 games? It took us 69 games on this team to get to 2719, and I have to play half that each week just to get capped. Then let's look at my 2s. 95% win rate, 61 games to 2600. 24 games every week to cap there. Sweet. 69 games took around 8 hours when we farmed up. So 4 hours for 35 games.<br />
<br />
Then RBGs, 9 RBGs, 75% win rate, 12 games, each game is like a 10+ min que time, and usually 15-30 minutes long. Let's just call the average around 30 minutes. Not counting making groups, finding replacements. That's 6 hours of RBGs.<br />
<br />
Pretty annoyed.<br />
<br />
So you mean instead of capping your weekly conquest points in an hour or so, which is DOUBLE the weekly cap for Valor points that can NOT be increased, you might actually have to spend some time in arena? like maybe 4 hours - you know, the amount of time it takes to clear all the raids in a week + some heroics to cap VP...<br />
<br />
Seems fair to me...I swear to god PvP'ers are the worst cry babies on the planet<br />

<br />
By Cataclysm's third raid tier, people will be running current heroics in 20 minutes or less, just as in the end of WotLK. They're not even hard or time consuming now; guild groups handle them just fine, and the the 15% buff makes all but the most fail groups able to finish them easily. If you want to talk about the endurance required for PvE epics, talk about progression raiding and RNG loot tables. Leave 5-man dungeons out of the discussion.<br />
<br />
That aside, it is possible that the Conquest grind (and yes, I agree that it's a grind while you're gearing) should be more time consuming than 5 wins a week, but to have this changed dropped on us without ever hearing any developer discussion about it, or even having it listed in the 4.1 patch notes...it's really aggravating. PvPers will adjust, but we have the right to rage at Blizzard right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, there is the rating issue... (lol)<br />
<br />
You mention this as if it's an afterthought. There is now a disincentive to climb past 2200. I know most players won't run into that issue, but a system that exponentially penalizes you the higher you get your rating is a fundamentally flawed one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not the pvp we hate.<br />
<br />
It is the absurd amount of time that we are almost FORCED to play annoys us to death.<br />
<br />
I play 3v3 arena with 2 close friends whom I played area with since TBC. (and raided with back on vanilla wow)<br />
<br />
They both have very busy work schedule during week days, along with a new born baby. So, we only get to play about an hour or two during the weekend's night once baby goes asleep. We enjoyed our 5 win per week system, which usually take 7 to 10 games in 1800~ 2000 MMR bracket. This usually takes about an hour~ hour and half to finish, which makes arena great after-dinner weekend hobby for all three of us. Thanks to new system, we didn't have to worry about getting behind in gear just because we have 'shorter amount of times played'. Which meets the basic concept of &quot;skill &gt; time grind&quot; part of pvp. But, this new system just screw us all up. We just don't have the time to play that much games per week, and &quot;weekend part-time job that pays in conquest points&quot; is the last thing we need in our lives.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;forced to play&quot; part, At the moment, I have bis epics on every slot aside t2 weapon, so I probably wouldn't even bother reaching point caps per week for three of my toons for the sake of gear. (2 being alts that i do not play 3v3 ) However, coming next season.... just to avoiding getting behind gear, we probably have to play more games.<br />
<br />
I agree they have to force top bracket players. I am aware how they sit on their glad safe rating and top brackets are not stimulated enough.(while spending their sweet time selling 2.2k PR for gold/cash, thus ruins mid-end bracket) But, this is just not the way. <br />
<br />
They should have made those top rated teams to LOSE THEIR TR/PR if they decided to sit on their rating. Put a minimum games (like..10 games?) to play per week to prevent those TR/PR loses. + prevent them from getting their 3v3 2700 personal rating point cap via 2v2 by giving them the 2v2 ponit cap if they decided to get their 5 wins via 2v2. This patch just sucks.</div></div><hr />

As someone who has multiple characters above the point threshold where you start gaining more points, including a few characters who will have to have around 20 victories a piece to reach their cap this is unacceptable. If you factor in queue times, Arena duration and the fact that you aren't going to win 100% of the time... well assuming a 66% win ratio while also having your cap that high or higher (AKA you are at the very least on the road to high Duelist if not Gladiator) and factoring in reasonable (Don't even touch bad) queue times and Arena durations you have about 8 hours of time to cap one character, keep in mind that's if you non stop queued and got reasonable queues and had no breaks whatsoever in between and with the new system you only have about 20~ seconds to accept a queue so you can forget bathroom breaks.

This is the worst change Blizzard has made this entire expansion, worse than any nerfs any of the classes I play may have received, worse than any class Blizzard has let remained overpowered in PvE or PvP. The worst. I'm sorry, I don't intend to dedicate my entire existence to this game.<br />
<br />
totally agree with you bro<br />
<br />
Blizzard is trying to make wow into a part time job that pays in currency only usable in Azeroth yet again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE and PvP are different, yet they continue to make board comparisons. Don't compare the time you put into PvE and try and mirror that to PvP, it's not even remotely comparable.<br />
<br />
As someone who has multiple characters above the point threshold where you start gaining more points, including a few characters who will have to have around 20 victories a piece to reach their cap this is unacceptable. If you factor in queue times, Arena duration and the fact that you aren't going to win 100% of the time... well assuming a 66% win ratio while also having your cap that high or higher (AKA you are at the very least on the road to high Duelist if not Gladiator) and factoring in reasonable (Don't even touch bad) queue times and Arena durations you have about 8 hours of time to cap one character, keep in mind that's if you non stop queued and got reasonable queues and had no breaks whatsoever in between and with the new system you only have about 20~ seconds to accept a queue so you can forget bathroom breaks. Now keep in mind you also have to weave that into your both your threes partners times and then shove in another character or two or maybe even three... well it gets real stupid real fast.<br />

The reason they are comparing is because its based on a similar reward value in gear. Currently people do 5 wins etc to cap. I know people in full vicious/t2 weapons at 2400+ rating who have a whopping total of 140 arena matches this season - most their wins were sub 6minute fights with 5minute queues. So 5 matches per hour/hour and a half per week. In comparison, a person in full tier would raid for 3 hours per night, generally 2-3 nights per week to compete in the other aspect. This is why so many people in heroics have full vicious because its easy mode to higher dps/gearscore. <br />
<br />
If you think 8'ish hours per week is your entire existence, then wtf are you playing a MMORPG in the first place for? 1 hour per day is very minimal to stay competitive. Also if you have been playing arenas long enough this season, and high enough, the only reason for you to need to cap points is for gold or such as you would have full PvP gear set and probably secondary spec (if hybrid) mostly done. <br />
<br />
I think the points should scale however so 10 wins/15wins per week caps points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the so called competitive aspect of the game has done nothing but creating a huge gap between casual players and high end users.<br />
<br />
This gap actually discouraged many players to avoid playing arena. <br />
<br />
It has done so in past arena seasons since TBC. The &quot;5 win system&quot; and easy and flexible access to basic gear to stay somewhat competitive (really competitive guys would farm for PVE trinket, rings etc that will give them advantage in pvp in future as they have done so before ) abolished those bullshit gaps that ruined arena in previous expansion.<br />
<br />
now, it is nothing but a stress factor.<br />
<br />
keep in mind that MMORPG is NOT about farming gears and achieve some higher statistic values in gearscore. You really don't wanna bring down RL resume update race to stay &quot;competitive in market&quot; into video game.</div></div><hr />

Yup, it was the final nail in the coffin for my boyfriend. He has decided to let his sub lapse simply because of this change.</div></div><hr />
