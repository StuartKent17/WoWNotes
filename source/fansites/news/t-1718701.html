Patch 6.1 - Dev Interview<br />
Our friends over at MammyTwink had the opportunity to interview Ion Hazzikostas (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev) recently. The highlights of the interview are below, but be sure to watch the whole thing for more context.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVBEGl86Ux8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Future Content<br />
<br />
The team is hard at work on much more sizable and proper content patches that will be coming in the future.<br />
There are a lot of surprises and exciting stories in store for Patch 6.2. A lot of the information is laid out in quests so far and 6.1 quests will add some more story.<br />
The team will consider adding more heirloom slots, but they don't want to let you fill every slot with heirlooms, as you would never get any gear upgrades while leveling. <br />
New reputations will be added where they make sense, such as with new factions or rewards. Patch 6.2 could have some new reputations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
The team is looking to add more reasons for you to visit a friend's garrison, starting with a few different things like quests and bosses in Patch 6.1. <br />
Guild garrisons are an interesting idea, but it comes down to who owns and controls the guild garrison. It would be a lot of fun for whoever is controlling it, but for everyone else it would just be something there that they can't control. <br />
The Garrison Campaign will set up the invasion of Tanaan Jungle, so there isn't any more story to tell in Patch 6.1. There are also players still working their way through the Garrison Campaign now, so this break will give them a chance to catch up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 is adding the Heirloom system, Blood Elf Models, and content that gives you a way of interacting with the world that is already there in a new way, getting some new rewards, and revisiting things you haven't been to in a while.<br />
Many players already use social media to keep in touch with friends, share screenshots, and talk about boss kills / loot. The team has been thinking about Twitter integration for a while. It is a convenience for people that are already using Twitter, and not really an attempt to get people who aren't already using Twitter involved.<br />
Patch 6.1 class tuning is mostly buffs to weaker specs and talents, so it shouldn't drastically change things. <br />
Patch 6.1 gave the team a chance to polish the character models and tweak them according to player feedback. In general the team is happy with how new character models have worked out. The new models aren't completely finished though, the team will continue to tweak and improve them as time goes on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackrock Foundry<br />
<br />
The team is happy with the reception of Blackrock Foundry so far. <br />
It has a very cool environment that is also integrated into the fights and feels like a real place, not an area just designed for a raid. <br />
Some of the introductory fights on Normal mode may be a little too challenging for people coming in from Normal Highmaul. The difficulty progression is okay so far other than that.<br />
The buff runes give you roughly a 1% increase in power and even the best guilds aren't using them regularly. They are being saved for when a kill is really close and you might need them to get that last 1%. <br />
Guilds that feel like they really need the buff runes (such as those working towards hardcore Mythic progression) are often the ones selling runs, loot, and achievements, so they can afford to purchase runes for raiders. <br />
Giving the runes to players in Raid Finder allows players to win something they can sell for extra gold, without directly adding more gold to the economy. <br />
High end raiding guilds used to buy a lot of consumables from players and then sell BoEs and epics back to players. The buff runes are a similar system. <br />
<br />
<br />
Flying in Draenor<br />
<br />
The team is satisfied with not being able to fly in Draenor right now, as it allows the world to feel larger and more dangerous. <br />
Travel should remain convenient though, which is why Patch 6.1 has a few flightpath improvements. <br />
Quests that ask you to do things like free a prisoner from a cage now require you to fight through the camp to get to the cage, not just fly over a wall, land on the cage, click it, and fly away. <br />
Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles are also content that can be added with no flying. Patch 6.1 didn't change any of the reasons for having no flying. <br />
While the outdoor content remains in Draenor, not having flying makes sense, just like Isle of Thunder and Timeless isle. <br />
Players assume flying will never come back, even though the team is still making up their mind about it. There are differing opinions internally and it is still an ongoing discussion. If the team decides to not do flying in Draenor during this expansion, they will let us know. <br />
Being able to fly in most of Draenor but not Tanaan Jungle is one possibility. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic Blackrock Foundry Progression<br />
Method and Paragon both have 9/10 bosses down still, with no new guilds joining them yet. There are now 21 guilds at 8/10 bosses down. You can keep up with the latest progress on WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/), our forum thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1707079-Blackrock-Foundry-Mythic-Progression-Thread), and Manaflask (http://manaflask.com/en/articles/4114?ref=mmoc).<br />

New Colorblind Support in Patch 6.1<br />
Patch 6.1 adds some official colorblind support to the game.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
In World of Warcraft patch 6.1, you’ll find a new user interface system that we’ve designed to assist players who have common visual issues related to colorblindness.<br />
<br />
In the new ‘Accessibility’ interface configuration section, you’ll be able to enable both text and color enhancements that may improve your visual experience while playing WoW. ‘Enable UI Colorblind Mode’ (which was previously in the Help section) is now here. These text enhancements add certain words and phrases to the tooltips throughout the game—tooltips that, by default, use different colors to indicate useful information about objects, NPCs, and other players.<br />
<br />
For example, when you move your mouse cursor over a piece of rare gear and then a piece of epic gear, the game colors the names of the items blue and then purple, respectively. With ‘UI Colorblind Mode’ enabled, the game will add the words “Rare” and “Epic” to the tooltips for those items. For players who find it difficult to discern between friendly, neutral, or hostile targets, additional indication text in the tooltip will now appear when you move your mouse cursor over other characters.<br />
<br />
The game will now have three sets of colorblind filters to choose from: protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia.<br />
<br />
These are designed to assist players who have one of the three types of dichromacy, and should be useful to those who have one of the three kinds of anomalous trichromacy: protanomaly, deuteranomaly, and tritanomaly. Each set of color adjustments is available via a handy dropdown selector, and each comes with a ‘strength’ slider. The farther to the right you set the slider, the more the game removes potentially problematic wavelengths of color for each type.<br />
<br />
To learn more about color vision deficiencies, check out the Wikipedia article on “Color blindness (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness)”. You can find a number of resources and free online color vision tests at colorvisiontesting.com (http://www.colorvisiontesting.com/).<br />

Art<br />
are you guys going to fix the tier 11 mage helm for pandaren characters?<br />
Appreciate the heads-up! This is fixed in 6.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563877086184480769))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
why are Highmaul Relic BOA and not Bind to account like the Relic of Rukhmar?<br />
Appreciate the report! Thanks to your notice, we've fixed this for Patch 6.1 and Highmaul Relics will become Bind to BNet. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563878829530161152))<br />
<br />
with the crafted shield change, any plans to change the other crafted items? Specifically weapons?<br />
No further changes are planned to the Crafted (3) set membership at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563881134891610112))<br />
<br />
The new worg mounts are all bugged in size save the one from Nok-Karosh, will this be fixt on 6.1 ? http://t.co/imLTmp6AAK<br />
Thank you for the report! We'll get this fixed as soon as we can. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563891672312860672))<br />
<br />
Will sets like the Bloodsail Buccaneers set ever be transmoggable? I want my Worgen mage to be a Pirate all the time.<br />
It's not something we're currently planning to do, but a more thorough transmog system for the future is being discussed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563895008286097408))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Can you force Dinomancers on Horridon to loosen their clutch on orbs? Such a drag if you kill them before they transform.<br />
Once they are below 50% health, after a second they'll begin to do their thing. Or, don't kill 'em and go for the achievement! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563896362865930243))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Any official reply on why the &quot;Challenge at the Ring of Blood&quot; apexis daily hasn't being available since the first week of WoD<br />
The event is returning in Patch 6.1 but not as an Apexis Daily. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563879687164678144))<br />
<br />
World Events<br />
How come Crown Chem Co. dungeon minimum level is 100 this year? Shouldn't it be accessible a level or two early like normal?<br />
Moving forward, we're tuning loot and difficulty for the holiday dungeons to max level, and LFG requirements reflect that. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563896634585542656))<br />
<br />
no longer interested in ever doing the turtle game at the Darkmoon Faire with how much harder you made it now on the PTR.<br />
It's actually much easier to get 10/10 now, provided you go in with a strategy. Watch that turtle's movements! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/564492468263997440))<br />
ok that worked, the tonk one though still seems ridiculous cause the tonk will shoot away from a target on multiple occations.<br />
Some achievements are meant to be difficult, if we wanted you to get all of them on day 1 we'd just mail you the toys on login. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/564496296296194048))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Any plans for 615/630/645 follower tokens? IMO, they should just behave as upgrade tokens if the targeted ilevel is higher<br />
We have no changes planned for these items. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563881269205811200))<br />
<br />
Will 6.1 jukebox music choice persist between zone transitions/logout, or must music be reselected upon entering the garrison?<br />
Persists when you exit your Garrison on foot/mount. Upon login, it'll play the last song then transition back to normal music. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563891358813810689))<br />
<br />
Are there any plans of increasing follower limit, since you introduce even more of those in 6.1 (Garrona and stuff?)<br />
Not in 6.1. The mission additions shouldn’t add significantly more mission volume such that you'd need more active followers. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563892299294203904))<br />
<br />
why do i get &quot;Failed to create pet battles&quot; when trying to do the dailies in Garrison ??<br />
Typically happens if there is a ground object obstructing your line-of-sight to the battler. Can you replicate the issue? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563893004625125378))<br />
If you can replicate, please post a screenshot of where you're standing and post the details in our Bug Report forum. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563893215397281792))<br />
<br />
Is there any plans in the future to expand Bodyguard traits in Followers? I have some Followers I would love to take with me!<br />
No plans for changes to followers in 6.1 along these lines, but it's an interesting idea and something we'll consider. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563894315999432704))<br />

The team is satisfied with not being able to fly in Draenor right now, as it allows the world to feel larger and more dangerous.<br />
<br />
Of all the reasons given for no flying, that one is utter bullshit. The world feels no larger or more dangerous than it ever has.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests that ask you to do things like free a prisoner from a cage now require you to fight through the camp to get to the cage, not just fly over a wall, land on the cage, click it, and fly away.<br />
<br />
The actuality is more like &quot;run past mobs, they'll probably de-aggro&quot;, but it's a moot point as virtually no quests have objectives like that at max level A couple in the Garrison campaign, maybe, but they're always joined with &quot;kill x number of mobs&quot; making running past mobs pointless as you need to kill them anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles are also content that can be added with no flying. Patch 6.1 didn't change any of the reasons for having no flying.<br />
<br />
Can't argue against that tbh. I don't find jumping puzzles or treasure hunts enjoyable at all though, but I guess some people out there might.<br />
<br />
<br />
While the outdoor content remains in Draenor, not having flying makes sense, just like Isle of Thunder and Timeless isle.<br />
<br />
Isle of Thunder felt justified in it's no-flying as it's linear nature meant that flying would break sequence and make things trivial. Unfortunately Blizzard forgot to copy the design practices that made Isle of Thunder good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Players assume flying will never come back, even though the team is still making up their mind about it. There are differing opinions internally and it is still an ongoing discussion. If the team decides to not do flying in Draenor during this expansion, they will let us know<br />
<br />
I'm assuming nothing at this point, but if it doesn't come back I'd be disappointed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being able to fly in most of Draenor but not Tanaan Jungle is one possibility.<br />
<br />
That'd be a start.</div></div><hr />

No plans for changes to followers in 6.1 along these lines, but it's an interesting idea and something we'll consider. (WarcraftDevs)<br />
<br />
I hope they go through with this. Follower npc abilities are already coded in (already about 8-9 specs for bodyguards); the only thing that needs to be set is the reputation / special abilities. That should not be too hard to figure out. Just make it chance for repair vendor/missiontable/mailbox/summoning portal/bank. Add some more stuff like - Hunter stable, tmog vendor / food vendor / reagent vendor / zone consumable vendor / Savage Feast - and BAM! done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same with &quot;Fly in, click item, fly out&quot;, the only content that has even a glimmer of relevance at level 100 are the garrison-quests (Which anybody who kept up even slightly is done with by now) and Apexis-dailies, both involve a lot of mob-killing, the Apexis-dailies are literally &quot;Steal kills until the meter fills&quot;, the main thing people want to skip is weak, low-level mobs that will lovetap you off your mount as you try to ride past them (And that bitchy orc at the Highmaul flightpoint, i get it, you're real savage-like...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
also flying - there is no point of flying atm since there is 0 content to do - no reason to leave your garrison at all on 100 - if there was only garrison and no draenor outside nobody would notice as long as we could jump straight to raid instance - this is so far worst expansion ever - sad part is it was supposed to revitalise wow - well so far its failing horrendously. mop had 100 times more pve content outside of raiding at this point of expansion - there was a reason to move your ass from shrine - atm there is no point to do anything besides sending your follwoerso n missions twice a day and then log off till raid time.</div></div><hr />

Not in 6.1. The mission additions shouldn’t add significantly more mission volume such that you'd need more active followers.<br />
<br />
These damn devs... so what's the point in having a limit to something that you are treating as a collection, even supporting the idea of collection with achievements? I'd love to hear what is the design goal and logic behind such a system where you are rewarding followers constantly through quests, achievements, reputations... and then ask the player to ignore the reward. There needs to be a limit sure, but in the number of active ongoing quests, not in the number of followers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm really glad my sub is running out soon. Their promises of something better 6 months down the line get old at one point. Especially when they end up giving us the opposite. The game is steadily becoming more lackluster as time passes and they're doing absolutely nothing to change it aside from giving people ways to play and advance that don't require them to actually play.</div></div><hr />

When you have Ashran you don't need PVP in Draenor zones. Talking about dangers, they're just idiots or trying to make us idiots. What dangers??? Would be nice if they provide us data how many level 100 characters spending their most time in Garrison and how many spend time outside lobby.

The team is satisfied with not being able to fly in Draenor right now, as it allows the world to feel larger and more dangerous.<br />
Travel should remain convenient though, which is why Patch 6.1 has a few flightpath improvements.<br />
Quests that ask you to do things like free a prisoner from a cage now require you to fight through the camp to get to the cage, not just fly over a wall, land on the cage, click it, and fly away.<br />
Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles are also content that can be added with no flying. Patch 6.1 didn't change any of the reasons for having no flying.<br />
While the outdoor content remains in Draenor, not having flying makes sense, just like Isle of Thunder and Timeless isle.<br />
Players assume flying will never come back, even though the team is still making up their mind about it. There are differing opinions internally and it is still an ongoing discussion. If the team decides to not do flying in Draenor during this expansion, they will let us know.<br />
Being able to fly in most of Draenor but not Tanaan Jungle is one possibility.<br />
<br />
Let's talk about htis nonsense for a second:<br />
1. They basically admit that Draenor is very small and they packed it with meaningless mobs + no flying = to slow us down<br />
2. More nonsense about flight path improvements, it is 10 years now since they first began improving them. Do you believe those guys?<br />
3. Can any of us remember a quest in which we have to free someone from the cage and NOT FARM THE KEY FROM THE MOBS IN THE AREA? You do? It can be easily fixed by requiring us to FARM THE KEY FROM THE MOBS IN THE AREA.<br />
4. Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles can be added regardless of flying.<br />
5. What outdoor content?<br />
6. Yeah, because you like it and don't say when it comes back<br />
7. Losing a lot of subscribers is another possibility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The actuality is more like &quot;run past mobs, they'll probably de-aggro&quot;, but it's a moot point as virtually no quests have objectives like that at max level a couple in the garrison campaign, maybe, but they're always joined with &quot;kill x number of mobs&quot; making running past mobs pointless as you need to kill them anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't argue against that tbh. I don't find jumping puzzles or treasure hunts enjoyable at all though, but i guess some people out there might.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Isle of thunder felt justified in it's no-flying as it's linear nature meant that flying would break sequence and make things trivial. Unfortunately blizzard forgot to copy the design practices that made isle of thunder good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm assuming nothing at this point, but if it doesn't come back i'd be disappointed.<br />

hehe.. Thing is whats the lore reason for no flying? Flight paths can fly and they are some of the same exact mounts we can collect. Atleast they are looking at mounted combat and seeing how that could work.</div></div><hr />

Possibly to the devs that get to work on it. Seems smaller then ever from behind my Garrison walls. If they only paid people based on their grasp of logic.<br />
<br />
I go out to this big world - straight through my engineering portal, to either:<br />
<br />
A. Raid<br />
B. Kill few mobs for the barn<br />
C. Step just outside to use a Blingtron that someone kindly puts down as I haven't gotten around to crafting one myself.<br />
<br />
That would be it. There is absolutely no incentive, past the initial 5k apexis for the legendary, to ever leave your garrison other then the 2 above reasons. <br />
<br />
The rares aren't rares and are rather insignificant.<br />
There are no interesting pets to tame/camp.<br />
There are no cap level quests of any value.<br />
Rep rewards are lackluster. This is the first expansion I can't even name all the factions available to grind if someone may wish to do so, let alone show interest in actually bothering with it.<br />
There is little point collecting mount no 200, when you don't even get to use any of the ones you already own - personal speed boosts get you around the Garrison just fine. So I got this awesome dragon last xpac - sorry, in few months it has lost it's ability to fly, together with all the other flying mounts. Somewhat anti-climactic. <br />
<br />
Never, during my 8 years adventure with the game was I able to obtain so much gold with so little effort; not having to see most parts of the map and not via playing the AH. <br />
<br />
The game has become a serious of mini games within, that could quite happily all be ported to a mobile platform. It's a great shame, cos the raiding, first time in a long while, is very, very interesting yet it does not really feel like part of the main game either - teleport in, teleport out. Whether you're raiding with a guild or via LFG, the Garrison serves as a waiting lobby. You do your daily chores, get your goodies, craft a thing or two, than tab out of the game waiting for a ding or activity on voice chat that notifies you it's time.</div></div><hr />

Getting around Draenor is fun, it's not a chore and with things like Aviana's Feather and Goblin Gliders you can be quick and inventive about how you do it.<br />
<br />
I am a little disappointed there is no Tanaan Jungle content in 6.1 (or did I miss that?). The guild and I are currently 7/10HC and within a reset or two we'll start on Mythic. There's still plenty of content to keep us busy and always alts to revisit and the Garrisons to tend to. I feel quite bad for LFR players, but then they have (now) more than ever the incentive to aspire to Normal+ raiding and/or find Guilds.<br />
<br />
To everyone saying things like they won't try the expansion until flying, you're missing out on a great expansion. Flying belittles the continent. Everything is by design the way it is. And it feels great. There are lots of conveniences for you to hop around Draenor and Fly Paths aren't exactly the bane of existence; it's a moment to sit back and chill. Getting to Highmaul, BRF is a doddle. Warspear, a doddle. Set Hearthstone to MoP Shrine and you have all of your portals you'll ever need a click away. Flying is absolutely a non issue in Draenor.<br />
<br />
Bravo to Blizzard for having the balls to implement a brave design, and the tenacity to stick with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad you're enjoying it. There are others who aren't (sorry but not everyone shares your opinion). I already have cancelled my accounts and am just waiting for the time to run out. I logged on once a day for the last 2 weeks for a shot at the Valentines Day mount and that's it. There is nothing left in the game that I want to do in it's current state. I don't raid any more due to work (I quit after Firelands in Cata), as my schedule isn't consistent, so I can't do the consistent schedule thing anymore. I've tried to get into Normal groups, but I don't meet the ludicrous requirements most groups are asking for, and I don't have time to commit to creating my own group (my time in wow is usually sporadic, 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there type of thing)<br />
<br />
I've done the alt thing (I have 4 100's now, and unlocked my garrison on all my other toons). So if I want I can literally spend hours each day just playing the garrison mission mini game (but I've already maxed out all my toons followers at 100 Epic and have 10k resources on them, so now I need to actually level, as right now the only thing to do with them is Gold and XP missions).<br />
<br />
I refuse to level Archaeology. I started, and within 15 minutes wanted to cut. Getting around in Draenor is hardly &quot;fun.&quot; It's a chore. I have to run to a flight point, take a flight to some place near where I am looking to go (usually never near) and then get on my mount and ride through Mobs and pray I don't get dismounted. Sorry it doesn't cause me to stop and clear every mob on my way like Blizzard seems to think it does. I ride through and kill the few that don't drop aggro when I get where I'm going (though I usually ride a bit further so I don't even have to kill them).<br />
<br />
Jumping Puzzles.. Seriously I'll go back to playing GW2 if I really want to do Jumping Puzzles. At least they got it right. What WoW is passing off as jumping puzzles is a joke. And with toys such as Aviana's Feather (I know it's not labeled a Toy, it should be), the entire argument of no flight goes out the window. Yeah it takes a little more skill to land, but it is the same thing.. I've used it to skip this content that Blizzard is so intent on smashing down our throats, so ha. And yeah I've actually waited out the cooldown on it just so I didn't have to ride my ground mount.<br />
<br />
Flying Mounts on the ground. This is actually my biggest pet peeve. They look like crap on the ground, and take up so much space. I hate when others are using them. Ride a ground mount that doesn't take up so much space. And the fact that they keep selling them to us (or giving them to us with the release of an expansion we can't fly in), is a another slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I could go on all day, but I'm just part of the &quot;vocal minority&quot; right? Anyone have some actual facts to back up that statement?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinnerlol</div><div class="date">2015-02-17, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think we should call 6.1 &quot;content patch&quot; and some people should just stop cry about this, this patch more like a &quot;what was not finished at launch, now its pretty much finished with some few extra things&quot; and thats it. WotLK launched at Nov.14 and Ulduar released April 14, Cataclysm launched Dec.07 and we got some content again at April 26, so im not sure why people except to get anything new huge things just 3 months after release...but thats just my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

The whole point, according to the devs, is so that the casual players have a good source of income. I doubt that the actual players this is aimed at have any idea that they should be doing that. I'd bet most of the runes being sold are from raider alts. Maybe I'm wrong, but it just seems that way.<br />
<br />
Also, are they seriously making the DMF turtle game harder? Ugh. The amount of times I've had to spend more than one token getting that daily done because it's RNG and I can't do anything to ensure I win it is stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World never felt large. Blizzard keeps using the word 'dangerous', I don't think it means what they think it does. The world is not dangerous in any way, shape or form. Doing open-world quests / content I think I've died at most a handful of times, and most of them were me dying to environmental effects --- I can survive that fall....sure you can :). This includes doing every group quest (the few that there are) solo. I also tried to solo every rare I came across (couldn't stop others from joining in half way through the fight).<br />
<br />
The point here is that nothing challenged me, nothing made me think about how to do something, and certainly nothing was dangerous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Travel should remain convenient though, which is why Patch 6.1 has a few flightpath improvements.<br />
<br />
A few? Seems like major flight path revisions need to be implemented. For example I was in the southern end of Spires of Arak, and wanted to fly to Zangarr. The flight path that the game gave me was to fly to my garrison and then to Zangarr. I just went on doing other things then flying to Zangarr to turn in a quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests that ask you to do things like free a prisoner from a cage now require you to fight through the camp to get to the cage, not just fly over a wall, land on the cage, click it, and fly away.<br />
<br />
I'm a druid...see me stealth. If Blizzard wants us to experience the content and not skip content then they probably should have removed stealth, but they know the outcry there would have been very great.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles are also content that can be added with no flying. Patch 6.1 didn't change any of the reasons for having no flying.<br />
<br />
Repeat after me...&quot;WoW is not a platformer, WoW is not a side scrolling game&quot;. I really dislike jumping puzzles, but I have the &quot;Grand Treasure Hunter&quot; achievement&quot;, can I fly now? I know Blizzard hope that the `hidden` treasures would keep people out in the world looking for them, but they haven't learned from the past. Players will created lists / addons etc. Took me about 5 hours using HandyNotes to find the 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While the outdoor content remains in Draenor, not having flying makes sense, just like Isle of Thunder and Timeless isle.<br />
<br />
What outdoor content?? I most have missed something. <br />
Done all the zone quest lines ....... check<br />
Done all the bonus objectives ....... check<br />
Explored all the zones ....... check <br />
Done all the Garrison Campaigns.....check<br />
Done all of &quot;Securing Draenor&quot; (except for &quot;Challenge at the Ring of Blood&quot; which never spawns) achievement ..... check<br />
<br />
So, where is all of this outdoor content that they keep talking about&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Players assume flying will never come back, even though the team is still making up their mind about it. There are differing opinions internally and it is still an ongoing discussion. If the team decides to not do flying in Draenor during this expansion, they will let us know.<br />
<br />
The will make up their minds before the next expansion, maybe? They have been thinking about this for almost a year now (at least from the start of public beta). Remember that not making a decision, is making a decision .... and I see them just keep saying that they are thinking about it till the next expansion comes along.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomcaller</div><div class="date">2015-02-17, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And dont forget guys super fun feature of 6.1 - disabling the ability to do daily apexis in raid. That one is very important and makes daily &quot;quest&quot; much more interesting. Sigh last 3 days for my monument and never again hehe.<br />
<br />
Also Tanaan was supposed to be at release and you can see on the picture below new zone that was supposed to be in patch 6.1 (its where netherstorm is in outlands).<br />
<br />
*I was not able to post picture but google blizzcon draenor map and you can see it there.<br />
<br />
Now that zone was srapped totaly and was replaced by Tanaan being 6.1 content as it didnt make it for release. Now Tanaan is moved again to 6.2. So basicly this expansion will not only end with what was supposed to be at release but even less content. Even that new daily area for 6.1 (Iron Docks - super ugly zone if you ask me, but at this point I would be happy with anything) quietly dissapeared. Also no word on subscription token you can buy for money and sell ingame for golds they said would be comming in 6.1. And not to mention garrisons in different zones (I CURSE YOU FROSTFIRE RIDGE!!!).<br />
<br />
Well its always like that - blizzard has 10 mil subscribers so they put heads into asses again until it drops and then they scratch heads at what happened and claim that its just new era when people dont play mmos anymore. I know many more people would return to wow if it had alot of content every 3 months atleast. It started good in MoP until 5.4 (well besides battlefield barrens). I rather have more content than I am able to consume than not having shit to do.</div></div><hr />

The blue posts are just endless bullshit and ridiculous responses to player questions. And they can keep the token/subs they we're going to implement, most people I know just hand bad players gold and the bads pay for their subs anyway. With EQNext possibly in trouble, and no other mmos on the horizon, I might have to change gears here shortly and say fuck mmos for a few years.<br />
Honestly with blizzard being the gaming company all other gaming companies emulate when it comes to mmo's, the only hope I see for the future of the genre is a meteor hitting blizzard's hq and wiping everyone out so we can move on... or back... to the shit we love.</div></div><hr />

1. They basically admit that Draenor is very small and they packed it with meaningless mobs + no flying = to slow us down<br />
2. More nonsense about flight path improvements, it is 10 years now since they first began improving them. Do you believe those guys?<br />
3. Can any of us remember a quest in which we have to free someone from the cage and NOT FARM THE KEY FROM THE MOBS IN THE AREA? You do? It can be easily fixed by requiring us to FARM THE KEY FROM THE MOBS IN THE AREA.<br />
4. Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles can be added regardless of flying.<br />
5. What outdoor content?<br />
6. Yeah, because you like it and don't say when it comes back<br />
7. Losing a lot of subscribers is another possibility.<br />
<br />
There is no news or hidden stuff there about world's size. They've always said that to acommodate flying, the maps will always need to be larger or they would be ridiculous small when flying. And no, the maps are way larger than you're implying, just grab one of the items that let you fly for a few to check it. The problem is that they've designed everything with ground mounts in mind. Flying in Draenor would just screw 90% or more of it (because no, only a small portion of players do finish everything in a map at it's intended level instead of going to cap, than comming back). Jumping puzzles, some rares, etc... everything would be just gone.</div></div><hr />

The new models aren't completely finished though, the team will continue to tweak and improve them as time goes on.&quot; <br />

Yea, Like HUMAN FEMALE EYEBROWS!!!!! how fucking long have we been telling them this is an issue, as is the always surprised look they have regardless of the face chosen?

When the new models came out I looked at them, and the only improvement was female trolls, as I play mostly alliance, I just turned off the new models instead of dealing with the disturbing appearances. (except said disturbing appearances still show up in the garrison missions tab sadly)<br />

This is actually a point in animation and drawing, if you make the characters more cartoony then the viewer feels more of a connection with them, because they put some of themselves into the more general figure. Making them more realistic breaks that connection</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is actually one of the smallest worlds since TBC. The reason it appears to be bigger is because we cannot fly. You are right that it feels extremely claustrophobic specially with every zone being mostly linear both in quest content as well as pathways. How small is Spires of Arak? Its like a few narrow lanes in between large, useless forest tiles.</div></div><hr />

There are others who aren't (sorry but not everyone shares your opinion). I already have cancelled my accounts and am just waiting for the time to run out. I logged on once a day for the last 2 weeks for a shot at the Valentines Day mount and that's it. There is nothing left in the game that I want to do in it's current state. I don't raid any more due to work (I quit after Firelands in Cata), as my schedule isn't consistent, so I can't do the consistent schedule thing anymore. I've tried to get into Normal groups, but I don't meet the ludicrous requirements most groups are asking for, and I don't have time to commit to creating my own group (my time in wow is usually sporadic, 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there type of thing)<br />
<br />
I've done the alt thing (I have 4 100's now, and unlocked my garrison on all my other toons). So if I want I can literally spend hours each day just playing the garrison mission mini game (but I've already maxed out all my toons followers at 100 Epic and have 10k resources on them, so now I need to actually level, as right now the only thing to do with them is Gold and XP missions).<br />
<br />
I refuse to level Archaeology. I started, and within 15 minutes wanted to cut. Getting around in Draenor is hardly &quot;fun.&quot; It's a chore. I have to run to a flight point, take a flight to some place near where I am looking to go (usually never near) and then get on my mount and ride through Mobs and pray I don't get dismounted. Sorry it doesn't cause me to stop and clear every mob on my way like Blizzard seems to think it does. I ride through and kill the few that don't drop aggro when I get where I'm going (though I usually ride a bit further so I don't even have to kill them).<br />
<br />
Jumping Puzzles.. Seriously I'll go back to playing GW2 if I really want to do Jumping Puzzles. At least they got it right. What WoW is passing off as jumping puzzles is a joke. And with toys such as Aviana's Feather (I know it's not labeled a Toy, it should be), the entire argument of no flight goes out the window. Yeah it takes a little more skill to land, but it is the same thing.. I've used it to skip this content that Blizzard is so intent on smashing down our throats, so ha. And yeah I've actually waited out the cooldown on it just so I didn't have to ride my ground mount.<br />
<br />
Flying Mounts on the ground. This is actually my biggest pet peeve. They look like crap on the ground, and take up so much space. I hate when others are using them. Ride a ground mount that doesn't take up so much space. And the fact that they keep selling them to us (or giving them to us with the release of an expansion we can't fly in), is a another slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I could go on all day, but I'm just part of the &quot;vocal minority&quot; right? Anyone have some actual facts to back up that statement?<br />
<br />
@Zaphon -- well said. I would add that the &quot;rewards&quot; from the treasures would have to improve even to be classified as a joke. As for flying mounts on the ground, I would like to see them not usable in no-fly zones at all -- just grayed out in Draenor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting around Draenor is fun, it's not a chore and with things like Aviana's Feather and Goblin Gliders you can be quick and inventive about how you do it.<br />
<br />
I am a little disappointed there is no Tanaan Jungle content in 6.1 (or did I miss that?). The guild and I are currently 7/10HC and within a reset or two we'll start on Mythic. There's still plenty of content to keep us busy and always alts to revisit and the Garrisons to tend to. I feel quite bad for LFR players, but then they have (now) more than ever the incentive to aspire to Normal+ raiding and/or find Guilds.<br />
<br />
To everyone saying things like they won't try the expansion until flying, you're missing out on a great expansion. Flying belittles the continent. Everything is by design the way it is. And it feels great. There are lots of conveniences for you to hop around Draenor and Fly Paths aren't exactly the bane of existence; it's a moment to sit back and chill. Getting to Highmaul, BRF is a doddle. Warspear, a doddle. Set Hearthstone to MoP Shrine and you have all of your portals you'll ever need a click away. Flying is absolutely a non issue in Draenor.<br />
<br />
Bravo to Blizzard for having the balls to implement a brave design, and the tenacity to stick with it.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of players have no interest in raiding at normal or higher, in a guild or not. It's always been the case. Raiding is an option, or should be. That was determined in vanilla with the reaction by the players to &quot;raid or die&quot;, and a very small percentage of players only getting to see the raid content, which is why LFR was brought in. &quot;Just join a guild and raid&quot; is an obnoxious, fake bandaid solution that requires no effort on your part to address the real problems of actually doing that. The majority of players never &quot;aspired&quot; to be raiders, and weren't held back by LFR or anything other than their disinterest in it, or have legit time reasons, skill level, find the shortage of guilds that will take a raid-newb player and gear and train them, hell, most normal players can't even pug a lot of higher end content because of the douchebags who are cockblocking that content with ridiculous requirements to get into that content. Or, they just don't like raiding. <br />
<br />
It's great you're enjoying raiding, but the millions of players who don't raid, have no intention of raiding, they're a little pissed off right now by the lack of anything to do, and your &quot;bravo&quot; bullshit does nothing to address that.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
World never felt large. Blizzard keeps using the word 'dangerous', I don't think it means what they think it does. The world is not dangerous in any way, shape or form. Doing open-world quests / content I think I've died at most a handful of times, and most of them were me dying to environmental effects --- I can survive that fall....sure you can :). This includes doing every group quest (the few that there are) solo. I also tried to solo every rare I came across (couldn't stop others from joining in half way through the fight).<br />
<br />
<br />
The only &quot;dangerous&quot; thing I can remember were those fucking flower creatures in Shadowmoon that aggro on you from half a zone away, and make traveling in that zone a pain in the fucking ass - and it doesnt help the main quest in that area dumps you in a spot where all of them are between you and the way out, so you have to kill 300 more of them just to go on to the next quest.<br />
<br />
I want to meet whoever designed them, and follow them around for an hour kicking them in the ass, so they know how their content feels to players.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I don't remember any other zone where it felt dangerous, at all. Maybe the wolf packs in Nagrand, but they're easy to avoid. Or that one back where the orcs are coming on shore, the respawn there is pretty high. <br />
<br />
I don't remember ever dying going through the first time, on my rogue, and none of my other alts died in the early zones. I died later on, on my rogue, trying to figure out how to trap the elite beasts, but that's because I was doing it wrong. Most of the elites I tried, even the 100 level ones, can be beaten with the right tactics and the right garrison bonuses. <br />
<br />
I remember, starting out in vanilla, having to peel off gnolls carefully in Redridge, or you'd die, fast. I really learned sapping and throwing on them, it was tricky, and felt dangerous. Same for murlocks - pull the wrong one, and you had a wave of &quot;MURRURRGLE&quot; after you - and dead. I never felt that way in WoD, even running around frostfire as an alliance player.</div></div><hr />

EDIT:<br />
<br />
Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles are also content that can be added with no flying. Patch 6.1 didn't change any of the reasons for having no flying.<br />
<br />
I can think of maybe one or two jumping puzzles in Draenor. Not counting those Arrakoa &quot;jump puzzles&quot; in Spires which were more so &quot;walk a thin line with bad camera puzzles&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like, the &quot;hidden treasures and jumping puzzles&quot;, the ones that would be effected by flying are VERY rare. Do they honestly think they can sit there and act like these are big things? Or that they're even well made? Because the few there are, are very poorly done compared to even the simplest jumping puzzle in GW2. It's pathetic.<br />

After eight years, I have never been so close to quitting WoW. Even during the long content lulls between expansions, even when there were queues to enter my realm, I never really considered quitting. Why? Flying.<br />
<br />
I never thought it would come down to flying. I mean, how absurd, right? It's just a mode of transportation. But I loved flying. I collected flying mounts. I did not realize how important it was to me all these years because it never really went away; I took it for granted. Now it is gone and I want to quit. <br />
<br />
Perhaps my rage would be tempered if I felt Blizzard had a reason for eliminating flight in Draenor. But their reasons, identified in this interview, are complete bullshit. Other commenters here have identified why; I have little else to add. You want the world to feel large and dangerous? It doesn't. It didn't even when we were leveling. It never will, because to feel large and dangerous it would need to be large and dangerous, which it never will be because the leveling, open-world content of Blizz is, by design, supposed to be fairly easy.<br />
<br />
Flight would trivialize the jumping and treasure locating game? Even setting aside the fact that a lot of the treasures in Draenor require more than mere flight to physically locate, are you really going to eliminate an entire feature that has been in the game for eight years, which you've designed around for four expansions, because a few players enjoy jumping around the landscape to get a meaningless reward? Is that really the design direction you want to take things?<br />
<br />
And now you say you're still undecided about whether flight will be available. When will you make the decision? On the eve of the last content patch? Will the decision be &quot;no flight&quot;? Because if it is going to be, I will save myself the annoyance and bother right now, and just unsubscribe -- something which, again, I have never contemplated doing until now.</div></div><hr />

They are a bunch of spineless pricks. They claim to have people working on the next expansions but they have not made up their minds on such a key issue? They should just tell people one way or another. They are just blowing smoke up peoples arses so the people that want flying won't leave. They know all the hypocrites who say they hate flying will be the first one on a flying mount if they come back. This leads me to believe that we won't get it back.</div></div><hr />

Ask good questions, justify yourself.</div></div><hr />

Not as bad as the wowhead interview with Holinka which proved two things.<br />
<br />
1. In an interview, wowhead will do nothing but toss the dev easy questions we already know answers to<br />
2. Holinka largely has no idea what he's doing</div></div><hr />

I agree with that and the rest of Backjauer's post 100%. WoD feels smaller because it IS smaller, and no-fly just reinforces that.<br />
They didn't mention Isle of Giants, which I find amusing. It's a pointlessly no-fly zone.<br />
I don't have a problem with no-fly during leveling, but once you hit max level, and even more so once you gear up, mobs become obstacles, not challenges. Having to run past them or fight through them is tedious, but having to fight through the terrain is even worse.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, if you want to give us no-fly zones for current content, that's fine, but don't force it on us for the entire expansion.<br />
<br />
PS: I've already unsubscribed because of this issue. I came back to try WoD, but with nofly in 6.1, I had no interest in renewing my sub when it expired last month. I was thinking about coming back, but the Blizzard attitude toward no-fly is just repellant, so no thanks.</div></div><hr />

You enjoy the restriction? Hrmmmm. ;)<br />
<br />
One of the worst things about this issue, for me, is that I'm a live-and-let-live kinda guy, but this isn't a live-and-let-live issue.<br />
<br />
In Pandaria, if you didn't wanna fly, you didn't have to. In WoD, if you do wanna fly, you're screwed. :-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its because this guy (mamytwink) is an absolute WoW fanboy, he does not have the single clue of what a critical mind really is. So of course its the best type of individual for Blizzard to answer to.<br />
<br />
And before people come at me with &quot;oh its good that someone likes the game as it is&quot; I'll answer: this is good for an anonymous player. But someone claiming to be a kind of gaming journalist and making interview should try to be interesting and not just acting like a fangirl/boy to lick some corporate ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm french speaking and I know where this guy comes from. He is pretty bad</div></div><hr />

I do understand your point and to explain why i have to post a vanilla comment (sorry folks)<br />
<br />
****VANILLA WHINE INCOMING, LOOK AWAY NOW IF THIS DISTURBS YOU***<br />
<br />
Duskwood in vanilla was dangerous, even thoughit was an alliance only place but you pull 2 spiders at lv 18 = DEAD, hordies around = DEAD. Massive pvp battles going on every day and you would be caught up in them even if you didn't want to be.<br />
<br />
You don't get that in dreanor. Mobs are so easy now, even the elite mobs area faceroll for anyone in 665 gear. No PVP going on on my server because it is terribly unbalanced (like 96% horde 4% ally). No sense of wonder, no atmosphere. Duskwood was a scary place, i remember the first time i looked at it over from ellywn and ran across to see, i was killed by a huge spider lv ??, my heart was pounding, my excitement was out of this world.<br />
<br />
Its not the developers that have made Dreanor not dangerous, its the nostalgia of times passed and memories of an huge dangerous world that are now dead and buried due to advancement in computer game world design.<br />
<br />
But all that aside, if you want a dangerous PVE world, try Wildstar. I leveled up to level 35 as Dominion and while leveling in Ellesar, the forest with the spiders was horrible, at lv 12 if i pulled more than one spider i was dead, instantly. And with Wildstars AOE attack mechanics that was a really hard place to level. Once you got to level 16 though it was a facerool, which kinda spoiled it really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
God no. <br />
<br />
Were you asleep for the last couple of years when they screwed up the progression ranks and had to spend months trying to tune 10 and 25 to each other? Mythic 10 is where it should be - in the trash heap. It was an idea. It was tried. It was wisely discarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And some of you dare call them idiots or lazy? Fucking think about something more than your own value system. <br />
<br />
It's hilarious how literal you little pedantic know it alls take the tiniest word or phrase and try to make it into any strawman you want. For instance &quot;feeling dangerous&quot; must suddenly meet a list of qualifiers you design rather than you actually having an iota of aesthetic sensibility in a bone in your passionless uncreative bodies.</div></div><hr />

(except said disturbing appearances still show up in the garrison missions tab sadly)<br />
<br />
This is actually a point in animation and drawing, if you make the characters more cartoony then the viewer feels more of a connection with them, because they put some of themselves into the more general figure. Making them more realistic breaks that connection<br />
<br />
I'm sure thats a real concept, probably even taught in art classes. I've just not experienced it in these kind (epic fantasy) of games. The more intensity and detail, the better. Frazetta not Looney Tunes. WoW isnt there yet, but these models went in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So its ok that we're waiting half a year for something so small you can hardly call it a patch, because we'll wait another half year for a &quot;real&quot; patch.<br />
<br />
This interview is pathetic.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Hidden treasures and jumping puzzles are also content that can be added with no flying. Patch 6.1 didn't change any of the reasons for having no flying.<br />
<br />
I can think of maybe one or two jumping puzzles in Draenor. Not counting those Arrakoa &quot;jump puzzles&quot; in Spires which were more so &quot;walk a thin line with bad camera puzzles&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like, the &quot;hidden treasures and jumping puzzles&quot;, the ones that would be effected by flying are VERY rare. Do they honestly think they can sit there and act like these are big things? Or that they're even well made? Because the few there are, are very poorly done compared to even the simplest jumping puzzle in GW2. It's pathetic.<br />
<br />
The whole interview is question dodging and lies.<br />
<br />
You didnt wait half a year for anything, and technically all 6.0 content wasn't even available until 2 weeks ago. Its been 3 months since 6.0, and will likely only be 3 more until 6.2.<br />
