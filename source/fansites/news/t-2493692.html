I think people can appreciate both Classic &amp; Retail for different reasons. I started WoW in 2004 and I've played every iteration of WoW since.<br />
<br />
Frankly flying is one of the things I enjoy in Modern WoW, and it was rather a consistent feature from TBC through MOP. It wasn't until WOD that all of a sudden it became a &quot;problem&quot; for Blizzard. Nobody asked for Pathfinder. It was their excuse to keep us grounded since they rushed the expansion and didn't have the zones completed (capitals were scrapped, invisible wall around Tanaan,etc).<br />
<br />
Bring on the Blizzard apologists though :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh don't get me wrong, I love flying too. But I also understand why it's important for players to experience the world on ground level first as it gives zones a very different feel and since I can do that for a few months and then fly over everything, I get to enjoy both experiences.<br />
<br />
And really, people complain about no flying but you have a 5 minute whistle to the nearest flight master, and the flight markers are like what, every 30-45 seconds worth of riding your ground mount. <br />
<br />
I think Pathfinder is here to stay, and I don't mind it.</div></div><hr />

That's great, but you always have the option to just not fly. Not to mention by the time players reach max level, they've already explored 90%+ of the world content. Additional unlock requirements and time-gating just seems over the top.<br />
<br />
Don't rain on everyone else's parade just because you're fine with how things are.<br />
<br />
I won't be buying the next expansion if Pathfinder continues in it's current form. Plenty before me have already quit because of no flying/excessive requirements.</div></div><hr />

Isn’t it obvious? You complain about flight not being in the game like it’s some dealbreaker, when the maps aren’t that big and have things to do with WQs all over the map, as well as multiple FPs to take you close to wherever you want to go. Then you make comments about Classic in the same topic, a game that doesn’t have flight, has extremely few FPs, and involves running from point to point for 10-20 minutes of ground running with nothing to really do but chew the scenery (if you’re sticking to the main path).<br />
Whether Classic has flight or not isn’t the point. The point is you make a comment about hating BfA because no flight then make a comment about waiting for Classic, a game that doesn’t have exactly what you are criticizing another version for not having. The way you stated it comes off as hypocritical. If that wasn’t your intention, then just put a little more thought into your words.</div></div><hr />

However, not having flying reduces my game time tremendously once it's there. I really don't want to run around getting reps, finding zones, etc. just so my toons can all fly.

Liking Retail because it has flight (or should) doesn't mean you have to automatically hate classic because it doesn't have flight. That's a silly argument and I shouldn't have to explain myself to satisfy a sarcastic response.<br />

<br />
Why can't someone enjoy a feature (Flying) of Modern WoW, and also enjoy Classic WoW? Flying never existed in Classic.<br />
<br />
Basically you're suggesting that 100% of players will play either Retail or classic, and there will be ZERO crossover. Which isn't going to be the case, numerous people have already stated they are going to play both. But I guess we're all &quot;a unique cesspool of mouth breathers the result of many years of inbreeding&quot; ... Lol<br />

<br />
I did it in WOD/Legion (begrudgingly). Legion wasn't so bad because the game was actually fun to play.<br />
<br />
I've played a bit of BFA, mostly just Rated PVP with friends/guild, but it's always fun to explore. I would probably still be subbed right now if I could just fly around and explore, but I don't care for the long chorelist of reps to grind. Honestly it doesn't help that BFA feels like an inferior version of Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they seriously need to make it so i can unlock flying in the beginning of the expac (after I complete pathfinder) instead of making me wait till mid to late expansion.<br />
<br />
Bfa is so bad though I'm not even gonna bother this time around. Maybe if they released this in the begining when i played i might have tried but since they decided to make me wait ill just keep waiting foe the next expac and if that sux well i just wont play... plenty of other games to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except the lack of flying in Retail is for the purpose of dangling it as a carrot to keep us running on their MAU treadmill -- it in no way feels rewarding to complete when you have to do it every expansion for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
Classic has less convenience but also offers more satisfying rewards (IMHO). Take for example doing a WQ in Retail -- everything just flops dead when you look at it. At least in Classic if you're working on an (Elite) difficulty quest, it's appropriately hard for the rewards you will get.<br />
<br />
I think it really comes down to Retail WoW grinds feeling exploitative for the sole purpose of &quot;time spent in-game&quot; rather than serving a meaningful purpose. I don't find being forced to login for 1-2 hours each day to do my World Quests that are a complete joke as &quot;Fun&quot;. Pathfinder part 2 comes out and we get to do this all over again with a new set of reputations which consists of logging in every-single-day for 2-3 weeks.<br />
<br />
But keep telling me how I need to be on my Ground Mount for ~11 months to experience this riveting &quot;Content&quot;. Being able to fly isn't going to make trivial content any more trivial than it already is. If I can already kill a mob by farting on it, now I will be able to fly to the mob and fart on it all the same.</div></div><hr />

Flying should be part of x.1.5 not x.2</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cold Weather Flying, Master Flying (Not learning to fly again but flying faster in Cata or Wotlk with achievement), Wisdom of the Four Winds, Draenor flying, Legion Flying, BfA Flying.<br />
<br />
Yep we have to earn flying again like we always have had to earn it.<br />

The whole situation sucks anyways. Flying at max level needs to come back or they just need to ditch pt2. They need to stop dictating how people play/enjoy their game.<br />
<br />
How dare the developers of a game develop the game how they want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So either way people would stop playing and it has nothing to do with MAU treadmill. As you say it won't change trivial content. So you are whining about something that won't change the content and you would have already quit the treadmill after X months anyways.</div></div><hr />

Why can't someone enjoy a feature (Flying) of Modern WoW, and also enjoy Classic WoW? Flying never existed in Classic.<br />
<br />
Basically you're suggesting that 100% of players will play either Retail or classic, and there will be ZERO crossover. Which isn't going to be the case, numerous people have already stated they are going to play both. But I guess we're all &quot;a unique cesspool of mouth breathers the result of many years of inbreeding&quot; ... Lol<br />

I did it in WOD/Legion (begrudgingly). Legion wasn't so bad because the game was actually fun to play.<br />
<br />
I've played a bit of BFA, mostly just Rated PVP with friends/guild, but it's always fun to explore. I would probably still be subbed right now if I could just fly around and explore, but I don't care for the long chorelist of reps to grind. Honestly it doesn't help that BFA feels like an inferior version of Legion.<br />
<br />
There was no sarcasm in my response, it was a very literal direct approach to the hypocrisy of your comments. It’s like stating I’m done with McDonald’s because they only serve McRibs on a limited basis, that’s why I can’t wait to start going to Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr. The one you are stating your newfound devotion to doesn’t even have the one thing that’s a dealbreaker with another. It’s hypocritical. <br />
If you had stated something along the lines of “I’m fed up with Pathfinder and tired of waiting for flight and that makes me not like the game. I am looking forward to Classic and can’t wait for that to come out so I can play,” you wouldn’t be getting comments from me and others. It’s almost the same mentality that I think you were going for. It’s simple sentence structure and meaning.</div></div><hr />

Lol right. So you and your guildies all get together and say &quot;oh hey mates, flying is out soon, are your subs all cancelled?&quot;. What then, next expansion you say &quot;oi, old buddies, let's resub until flying is released again!&quot;. <br />

No, you find this system fine. I don’t, I find it ridiculous. They say they want us to experience the expansion on foot first, which I completely agree with, but then won’t let you get flying for months and months after having finished everything on foot, multiple times. They lie. I quit because of the lack of flying, and it took so long, I won’t be returning either.</div></div><hr />

Personally, It's not so much about my main character for me. But I refuse to level alts w/o flying. I did all the needlessly restrictive ground crap once already. Not going to go through the zones again on alts w/o the ability to speed things up. I've got a few 110s I'll finally be able to start progressing now.<br />
<br />
But what I don't get is why not let Pathfinder 1 give flying in what's available so far, and then Pathfinder 2 give flying in the new 8.2 content?<br />
<br />
Oh yes, Blizzard's primary focus of making the game as inconvenient as possible for players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's killing me is that they don't even bother finding a RP explanation to disable flying. Could be due to flying enemies, toxic atmosphere, ballistas stunning your mounts, literally whatever, but no, you just can't because, well, you can't. Okay I guess ?<br />
<br />
At this point MoP's &quot;pathfinder&quot; was the one which made more sense. Reach max level, buy flying, gg wp</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I agree. I just clarified what has been the tendency from Blizzard since WoD... In MoP we just had to buy a spell (https://www.wowhead.com/spell=115913/wisdom-of-the-four-winds), and getting enough rep with Golden Lotus just reduced the price. Those were the shiny times of how rep/factions should work.</div></div><hr />

It makes no sense. Blizzard forced players to walk the same old zones backwards and forwards for almost a year. But now they release a new major location and Ion Hazzikostas tell us &quot;flying in few weeks&quot;. You know Ion how much failure are you, most people don't even want to resub for 8.2 epic adventure because of it. Why bother to resub when flying in few weeks? This adventure is too short to even consider return to WoW.<br />
<br />
I understand that a casual player should enjoy flying in new zone before classic release. wowclassiccountdown com Why not give us 5 weeks to explore 8.2 zone without flying, 3 week to &quot;enjoy&quot; flying, looks like good timing to me.<br />
<br />
Also Vanilla has worst fun per time spent value.</div></div><hr />

We are 6 mates who has played together since vanilla. We have our own guild as we do not raid and do not have time to play hardcore anymore. The last 3 expansions we have all unsubbed when flying has arrived, this one included. The game is just not fun for us when flying is around.</div></div><hr />

We are 6 mates who has played together since vanilla. We have our own guild as we do not raid or have time to play hardcore anymore. When we play we explore the world, attack a horde city, quest together or join a bg. Flying ruin the fun for us. Maybe we are nostalgic, but we fell that the game changes when flying is around.</div></div><hr />
