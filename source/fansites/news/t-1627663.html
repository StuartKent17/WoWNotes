Well the expansion is about to be released, so there isn't really much for them to say about it other than what their current goals for the game is. Plus it's good that they are focusing on making other franchises as well so they can stay relevant in a wide market especially if wow just sinks one day.</div></div><hr />

blizzcon does kinda make it seem that way... except that you have to remember they JUST expanded the WoW dev team by 50%. Way would you expand development for something your abandoning?</div></div><hr />

I dont see that at all. There is a new expansion in 5 days. What can they say thats not already known or will be seen in less then a week? They arent going to announce a new Expansion so there really isn't anything to say. <br />
<br />
There was nothing about diablo but that doesnt mean Im worried the games dying. I understand that Reaper just came out and there isnt anything new atm.<br />

That is hilarious, considering they doubled thier team size for WoW and already talked about the game's future to be around for YEARS. So you just sound VERY VERY peranoid and frankly pathetic. They are a video game company, not a WoW company. Don't be afraid of change. You'll still have your WoW addiction around for along time.<br />

I got thrown with the WC 10/20 thing, was for sure WC4 was on the cards. The &quot;17 years ago&quot; had me thinking, 'OK, not WoW, WC2 HD version it is, but this is THE Warcraft moment'. Then, ugh.<br />
<br />
Like, I don't mind the look of overwatch, but c'mon, you lead into the reveal talking about WC legacy and history and Blizz awesomeness, then you release a unheard of IP, with no word of your stalwart?? Just seems, maybe a tad, taking warcraft for granted.</div></div><hr />

The next expansion is out in little less than a week. What more could they say about it that would actually be new and exciting? What could they hype that hasn't been hyped already? I don't think they're abandoning ship so much as the next step is to simply let people play Warlords of Draenor. <br />
<br />
Maybe next year will have more WoW stuff. An update on where they're at with faster content, or maybe if they've got that sorted it'll be the next expansion. Who knows. For now, I think we should take Overwatch as a sign they're not expecting to close down any time soon.</div></div><hr />

Bliz is clearly trying to expand their portfolio. One could surmise that, while WoW is still a cash cow, they are putting eggs into other baskets. Overall this makes good business sense. And the games they are adding, aren't as time intensive to maintain ... <br />
<br />
Their website has something like 200 job openings, which is a little troubling. It means to me that they are having difficulty getting (retaining) talent. The fact that Belf models are not complete, would indicate they are short handed, or maybe not as skilled as they once were in that area. I believe they indicated earlier this year that they were @6 months behind due to training/tools issues.<br />
<br />
Some of the Glassdoor reviews of Blizzard are interesting ;)</div></div><hr />

I've seen plenty of your posts on the old 'Rygarius Tweets on Patch Notes' and agreed with plenty you have said before. It is a bit more pathetic of you to, in a way, attack me by incorrectly spelling (paranoid) and pathetic (really? pathetic?). I had an observation made, I work, I go to University, and I embrace change within anything that I associate with. I do not care for shooters tbh and don't see this one making me take that leap of faith yet to switch. Please learn to post constructively, you and others who value your opinion will appreciate it in the long run.</div></div><hr />

Like I said, my opinion today is better than the knee jerk reaction I had yesterday. I've thought more about it and I don't want them spoiling too much about 6.1 before the game even comes out. I just wanted to hear new stuff, today's Q&amp;A will likely help.</div></div><hr />

That is ridicilous I think. Last Blizzcon it was all WoW. The expansion launches this Thursday, and they have been feeding us all the information we need about it in this year. I remember how some people thought that Eye of Azhara was the new WoW expansion, and while that hasn't been proven false yet, the assumption that they would kill the hype for the expansion just about the corner with a new one is bonkers. They're not abandoning ship, they're doing what a lot of people asked them to do, including myself and that is show if they can create a new ip since they've gone with their usual 3 for a long time.</div></div><hr />

It still has some of the usual art Blizzard use. Or at least the art they've come to use in the last few years. It's a very &quot;Blizzard&quot; game. It is just different and I for one am glad. They need new IP.</div></div><hr />

Because Blizzard only makes money from World of Warcraft, right. <br />

Also, it's not some kickstarter campaign, money are for access to game, what Blizzard is doing with them is their own business.</div></div><hr />

Iran did ban all the female champions in League of Legends, (except for Annie, who is a child) from competitive play in tournaments there. So yeah.<br />

I think there are 4 or so female Heroes, two of them are &quot;revealing&quot; (as in curvy and you see covered breats and panties along with curves - as in a beatiful female body). I like it, and no, I dont fap 24/7 to Nicki Minaj's Anaconda song.<br />

Because sex sells, and high heels are usually synonymous for sexy. And not to forget gaming is still largely dominated by a male crowd. All in all nothing wrong with that, vast majority of straight men like to look at fit sexy women, anyone denying that is a liar, may it be a real woman or a 3D model of a woman - attractive is attractive, that doesn't mean that we're sexually aroused by pixels, just that we like looking at women.</div></div><hr />

The child in the cinematic made Chris Metzen's inner six year old do cartwheels. He hopes everyone loves the game, but almost doesn't care.<br />
<br />
What did he mean by &quot;almost doesn't care&quot;?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Found a more detailed quote from Metzen on the topic: <br />
<br />
&quot;12:07PM Metzen talking about how this is a change for them. They're so used to &quot;indomitable Lich Kings&quot; and planet-cracking aliens. He says he hopes people love it, but doesn't really care, because it makes him feel alive agian. Not cynical, reaching for everyone's inner 6-year-old in terms of getting excited. Like the boy in the cinematic.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. It's needlessly sexualizes of the content.<br />
<br />
2. It's completely impractical for women to wear anything revealing while in combat. <br />
<br />
3. TERA's art style was ridiculous. Asian cultures generally hyper sexualize content to draw in male gamers, which is completely unecessary if you actually plan to rely on gameplay. We saw how successful TERA's gameplay was :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
4. You sound creepy.<br />

Ah yes, a game that was revealed about 4 months ago that bliz decided to mash together Overwatch in that time and even get a playable version on the floor with a working engine! Definitely bliz copying them!<br />
<br />
They're not even the same type of game, Battleborn has a hybrid Monster/enemy mix kinda like Moba's. The only comparisons that I found have so far been legitimate to Overwatch are TF2 and UT. Beyond that we've had to wade through comments like &quot;Anime, Wildstar,CoD, Borderlands ripoff!&quot;....</div></div><hr />

Tracer IS a quirky fun character, something that has been LACKING in the shoot-em-up genre. We always get edgy protagonists that spend their time pondering their past.<br />

Just like it's completely impractical for males to wear no shirts either (look at the characters and you tell me what's impractical). But... it's a VIDEO GAME?! Ya know? Video GAME? You're generally not looking for 'realistic' in a pixar-esq quirky high-octane adventure starring a cute tomboy 20-something girl named TRACER, who can skip in time to get places. <br />
<br />
Just like you aren't looking for 'realistic' in a pixar-esq quirky high-octane adventure ALSO starring a fully armored german guy running around with a giant hammer. OR a giant ape with glasses!<br />

I've heard plenty, and have been to various parts of England numerous times; living so close to it in Northern Ireland. I can safely vouch for the fact that no one sounds like Tracer or Gilnean/Worgen NPCs in real life; both of which are tantamount to caricatures.</div></div><hr />

The feeling is that they understand it cannot sustain itself forever i suppose, so Blizzard is preemptively abandoning ship and diverting resources away from it. I wanted to say something yesterday, but was so flustered that nothing new came out about WoW. The movie is great and all, and I'm sure people love HoTS and HS, however I personally did not find either of those games worth much more than a few hours total of play, especially with DoTA 2 being a much better game in my opinion. Metzen is now split between two projects and however little that may be, it honestly feels like Blizzard is spreading themselves too thin and not supporting what got them to the top like they could be. I'd hate to see WoW get gutted and die a slow death with hollow expansions and lackluster effort. Anyone have words of encouragement or a different opinion?<br />
<br />
Question. What did you expect them to talk about? The expansion comes out in less than 5 days. There really isn't anything that we don't already know.</div></div><hr />
