<br />
What? They made it drop from the last boss in the wing instead of first boss. The mount still drops from the wing, it just means people won't be dropping after the first boss and people won't join in progress ones nearly as much.</div></div><hr />

Both bosses are in the same wing though? If anything now there IS a point to doing the wing since you can't just kill the first boss and leave <br />

Think a little bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a meme often used by idiots in a context where it doesn't fit. This has nothing to do with fun, it's simply to keep people from leaving after the first boss and making the rest wait for the group to fill again, only to have many of the new people leave cause they also only wanted the first boss.<br />
<br />
Not that I would expect the type of clowns spamming &quot;fun detected&quot; regardless of context.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. So now you have to do the entire wing instead of leaving after the first boss</div></div><hr />

That's ignorant thinking. I guess by your thinking, it should be mythic only right? Why would it drop in normal or heroic, which are faceroll compared to mythic? See how that works?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, don't assign your thoughts to me and then making clever retort from it. Mythic have it's own mount, much nicer and unique one, might i add. Normal/heroic, which is what most of the raiding guild into, had something special too, but now you can afk it, instead of putting some effort.</div></div><hr />

So now instead of afking and being dead weight on one boss they can afk and be dead weight the whole wing :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can afk LFR, normal, and heroic due to all of the gear you get outside of them. You cant sit here and say that LFR requires no effort so they shouldn't get a mount drop when normal hardly takes any effort either.<br />
<br />
They should bring in what they did in MoP with the color variations to differentiate what mode you got it from for the mount.</div></div><hr />

Yea, I want to see someone in average heroic guild afking on a heroic bosses, unless they are part of the boost by a mythic guild. <br />
I'm talking about average raider in WoW, guilds who works as a team on a bosses, getting fun/slightly better gear due to TF and before that, special mount. Not anymore. I haven't done any LFR in BoD yet, and not planning to, but it would been nice for Blizzard to have something extra for those who make up largest raider population.</div></div><hr />

Just sucks I’ll have to suffer thru the entirety of LFR last wing on a possible wipefest boss for a chance at the mount.</div></div><hr />

Get over yourself. This helps with queue times and gets people who play the game a bit more seriously to help with LFR runs.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is no longer a gaming company, they've forgotten the whole point of having special things drop from hard content. What's next, every rare mount in the game has a chance to drop from every dungeon boss 1 week of every month? The pattern is slowly going in that direction and while yes, that's a silly idea and I mean it to be silly, there was a time in this game where all raids were of a set difficulty and if you couldn't do them, oh well. Most people were fine with that. I was even fine with that, I knew there were better players who devoted more time to the game, thus, they got better rewards. It makes sense. It stokes the &quot;oooh, ahhhs&quot; of &quot;how did you get that mount?&quot; from people. It gives the game character, it sparks emotion, it sparks intrigue. Nowadays, even on full pop servers, the chances someone will ask you where you got your Elegon mount are nonexistent.<br />
<br />
It baffles me and saddens me no one seems to want to recognize this problem.<br />
<br />
Why didn't the all the rare mounts drop in LFR before? It would have been too much. They've been gradually giving out more and more bits over the years, never too much at once, but just enough to progressively get to the point where everyone is pretty much indistinguishable from each other.<br />
<br />
The shadow priest I met fully decked out in tier 6 gear in Shattrath back in TBC got me asking questions and I ended up befriending her, I never got decked out in tier 6 gear, but I knew someone who was and I thought that was awesome. I loved looking at her character and hearing about the mysterious, epic Black Temple, Mount Hyjal, and Sunwell Plateau raids, beyond even the tier 5 raids I couldn't manage to run. I was happy, it left me something to wonder about, to imagine.<br />
<br />
Now, there's no more imagining. You want it? You can have it. You want to run the raid but aren't top-tier skilled? No worries! There's LFR. LFR is fine, to a degree, but when you make the final boss available in LFR, instead of something like &quot;progress to a higher difficulty to see how the story unfolds!&quot; you just simply take away everything that's amazing about raiding. When you make mounts like this drop in LFR? Why even bother?<br />

<br />
That's because Elegon can be soloed now. It's the same with the Argus mount. Just 8 months ago it was really rare and now nobody bats an eye because Mythic Antorus groups are in the custom group finder 24/7. I never even stepped foot in a raid higher than LFR last expansion and I easily got the Titanslayer title early this expansion.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard really want to make things more exclusive they need to lock more things to expansions or time periods and not difficulty. Either that or make every raid scale to be difficult in future expansions but with the constant stat squishes they do that probably isn't viable. FF14 does a good job with scaling content like that but also slightly fails at exclusivity because they still allow mounts to be dropped when you do the unscaled version of the encounter.</div></div><hr />

Large font? Check.<br />

<br />
If anything, it's to enhance the LFR experience for players who like to do it. Having everyone leave before the wing is over wasn't good design. It's never been good design and we should've seen something like this in previous raids with this issue.<br />

Now, there's no more imagining. You want it? You can have it. You want to run the raid but aren't top-tier skilled? No worries! There's LFR. LFR is fine, to a degree, but when you make the final boss available in LFR, instead of something like &quot;progress to a higher difficulty to see how the story unfolds!&quot; you just simply take away everything that's amazing about raiding. When you make mounts like this drop in LFR? Why even bother?<br />

Harder than queue up for randoms slamming their faces into the keyboard and killing the boss, all things fair.<br />
<br />
Let's remember back in the day how the mount would usually drop from the last boss and that boss was typically the hardest, in a series of boss encounters that progressively got harder.<br />

What a concept!<br />

If anything, it's to enhance the LFR experience for players who like to do it. Having everyone leave before the wing is over wasn't good design. It's never been good design and we should've seen something like this in previous raids with this issue.<br />

Sorry my bad, it's clearly extremely fun to sink more time than necessary into LFR.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is no longer a gaming company, they've forgotten the whole point of having special things drop from hard content. What's next, every rare mount in the game has a chance to drop from every dungeon boss 1 week of every month? The pattern is slowly going in that direction and while yes, that's a silly idea and I mean it to be silly, there was a time in this game where all raids were of a set difficulty and if you couldn't do them, oh well. Most people were fine with that. I was even fine with that, I knew there were better players who devoted more time to the game, thus, they got better rewards. It makes sense. It stokes the &quot;oooh, ahhhs&quot; of &quot;how did you get that mount?&quot; from people. It gives the game character, it sparks emotion, it sparks intrigue. Nowadays, even on full pop servers, the chances someone will ask you where you got your Elegon mount are nonexistent.<br />
<br />
It baffles me and saddens me no one seems to want to recognize this problem.<br />
<br />
Why didn't the all the rare mounts drop in LFR before? It would have been too much. They've been gradually giving out more and more bits over the years, never too much at once, but just enough to progressively get to the point where everyone is pretty much indistinguishable from each other.<br />
<br />
The shadow priest I met fully decked out in tier 6 gear in Shattrath back in TBC got me asking questions and I ended up befriending her, I never got decked out in tier 6 gear, but I knew someone who was and I thought that was awesome. I loved looking at her character and hearing about the mysterious, epic Black Temple, Mount Hyjal, and Sunwell Plateau raids, beyond even the tier 5 raids I couldn't manage to run. I was happy, it left me something to wonder about, to imagine.<br />
<br />
Now, there's no more imagining. You want it? You can have it. You want to run the raid but aren't top-tier skilled? No worries! There's LFR.

<br />
LFR is not organised content,and rewarding a mount of content that is done by 7-10 players while 15 players are AFK is not right,you shouldn't be rewarded with something as unique as a mount for clicking on a queue and taking a trip to the shop to buy groceries,while it makes sense to get something from teaming up with others and working together to complete content (just like it makes sense to get yet another reward for building a regular team and completing the hardest content)</div></div><hr />

It's more like stopping few collectors from screwing everybody else over. Collectors tend to be every efficient with what they do, which means they will likely Q for LFR as tanks/healers only. If half of the players of these roles leave everytime after the first boss, this is not a problem with content....it's a problem of putting a collectible on the first boss in a 3-boss dungeon.<br />
<br />
Now Collectors will want to finish the wing as fast as possible for their mount-chance...which helps everybody else. Seems like a win/win, as this is the first tme you could even get a mount from LFR in the first place.<br />
<br />
Having all that said...i have never done less LFR in any expansion than this one. I think i did 2 wings of Uldir and so far not a single one of Dazar'alor....unlike the majority(?) here on the forums i hate the faction-split design of this place and think it can go and die in a fire.

Yeah I don't know what to 'term' it, but yeah something similar happened in the past with WoD garrison quests and stuff like that, like putting additional side goals for people, which creates the conflict with others. Kinda like in Vanilla too when I was doing AV quests instead of the BG itself.<br />
<br />
I actually liked the Felhounds mount placement because it got me into High Command groups for the mythic cache quest, though it must have been frustrating for those trying to farm it</div></div><hr />

Just so you're aware, your post is EXACTLY why they moved it to the LAST boss. So a**holes don't join, kill the first boss and drop. Sorry bucko, you're in it for the whole wing or you can find yourself a normal/heroic progression guild.</div></div><hr />

You either enjoy LFR or you don't. The time it takes to kill Jaina rather than High Tinker is not significant enough to outweigh the enjoyment of LFR players enjoying LFR.<br />

Sure, that makes me an asshole, but the way I see it, I could either queue and actually try on 1 boss, leave and have it be refilled instantly by another dps, or I can just equate to dead weight on 3 bosses. There’s no winning situation for people arguing for the move.<br />
Also, as I said earlier, not sure why they moved it in this LFR but we’re okay leaving a mount in LFR on the 2nd boss in Antorus.</div></div><hr />

But honestly, getting it from LFR was a bad idea in the first place. Organized raiding is fun but getting something extra would be nice too, since LFR gear can titanforge to insane levels. But I guess blizzard just can't help themselves by giving everything away.<br />
<br />

Let me express myself properly because I realize I haven't.<br />
<br />
Running just the first boss is fun because I'm not forced to do anything else aside from that, I'm not forced to do anything I don't want to.<br />
<br />
The thing is that if I now join at the first boss, I gotta forcibly do these bosses I don't need at all on LFR, which is not enjoyable at all. I'll probably try to luck out joining an LFR instanced on Jaina or straight up drop it depending on the mood &amp; time.<br />

I understand that you think getting in and out quickly is fun, even if you don't enjoy the content. It's like old raids and rare transmog/mounts for collectors. They may hate the faceroll content, but they enjoy the chance at the mount.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't that you think it's fun. The issue is that you posted a meme implying that Blizzard nerfed it because players thought it was fun. In reality, it was the opposite. Just like the Hounds, it creates a situation that negatively affects the rest of the players. When a DPS drops, sure, you can just continue most of the time. But when your tanks and healers leave? Nah. And then when the new ones join for their chance at the mount, realized they missed it, then drop? That's just a lose/lose.<br />
<br />
Basically, Blizzard is telling your fun to take a back seat for the sake of the people who actually enjoy the &quot;difficulty&quot;. The meme doesn't work here because they made the change for the benefit of other player's enjoyment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It’s not being spiteful, it’s being a realist. I don’t want to be in LFR, I’m specifically going for the mount. On the first boss I had incentive to try and get out as fast as possible. On the 3rd boss that motivation dwindles as I’m playing with others that are either afk’ing or just at such a low skill level they may as well be. <br />
By the way, it takes quite a bit to actually be noticed in LFR. Short of standing still an entire boss fight, most people never notice. I’ve auto attacked bosses before and just followed the movements with ASDFEQ, after my opener, and ate a sandwich and have no problems staying in LFR.<br />
LFR is extremely easy, it’s also extremely funny watching people wipe on bosses after people like you talk about how easy it is. You also talk about classes being easy (which they are), but as stated not everyone has the skill to reflect that.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what you stated in the first paragraph is how I felt &quot;prenerf&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do understand the point of the change, but when I said fun detected and any further replies I meant them as a way to express how I personally felt. I apologize if it came out as widespread opinion.<br />

I do admit this is an overall good change, it really must suck either joining LFR for the sake of getting the weekly bonus while the first boss was dead then having to re-queue, that or losing time waiting for new tanks and healers which I guess can be high depending on the hours.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lime</div><div class="date">2019-02-27, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It’s not being spiteful, it’s being a realist.<br />
<br />
No, it's being spiteful, stop trying to sugarcoat it. There is no benefit to making the raid take much longer, even for you. You don't even have to give it 100% attention, but crossing your arms and not contributing is just silly.<br />
<br />
Your logic:<br />
&quot;I'm going to try on one boss so I can get out of here as quickly as possible&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not going to do anything on 3 bosses and make the run take longer&quot;<br />
<br />
Alternatively, it would even make more sense for you to semi-afk until Jaina, actually try for that to speed it up, and get done quicker. But you'd rather cut your nose off to spite your face. You're hurting yourself, lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, it takes quite a bit to actually be noticed in LFR. Short of standing still an entire boss fight, most people never notice. I’ve auto attacked bosses before and just followed the movements with ASDFEQ, after my opener, and ate a sandwich and have no problems staying in LFR.As a counter-anecdote, I've kicked numerous players who've tried it in Antorus. Count yourself lucky, as all it takes is one person speaking up and someone initiating a kick.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also talk about classes being easy (which they are), but as stated not everyone has the skill to reflect that.That had nothing to do with how other people play. That has everything to do with how you play. As you admitted, classes are easy. It would take relatively no effort to even do somewhat good on a boss. And doing so benefits you.</div></div><hr />

That's fair. It's just a really common thing people post here (and on various other community websites).

<br />
going by the typical statements in here, &quot;anything below mythic is faceroll&quot; and &quot;classes require no skill and are braindead easy to play well&quot;.<br />
according to those claims, it should be easy enough to press your 4 damn buttons and contribute instead of actively being an asshole.<br />
<br />
if you are in the LFR, then because you have decided to do so. do your part.<br />
but no, better be a burden for others, leech off of them, and then complain how those others get stuff &quot;they don't deserve&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Why shouldn't it?<br />
<br />
LFR participants are also players, and not everyone who participates in LFR is able to participate in other raid modes. So it's only right to put some nice rewards in there.<br />
<br />
The only possible objection to this would be if it was an LFR exclusive reward. But given that the mount also drops in normal, heroic and mythic, there is absolutely zero reason for anyone to feel any compulsion to run LFR to try and farm this.</div></div><hr />

While I would completely agree that game design 101 dictates the necessity of exclusive rewards, not every reward in the game has to be super exclusive. In fact I'd argue that the game does require some rewards that are accessible to everyone - it's also game design 101.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why does the mount even drop for LFR in the first place<br />
............<br />
<br />
A mount dropped from the 2nd boss in Antorus... Why is this suddenly an issue? It's not like it's guaranteed. And it's not like regular mythic King's Rest, Underrot, or Freehold are any more difficult than LFR (especially considering you can skip over half the dungeon in two of them). Get over yourselves. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
This makes zero sense - maybe it's because I'm not wearing a tin-foil hat to help me think with clarity.<br />
<br />
The primary argument for what makes LFR &quot;shit content&quot; is that it is so easy that everyone can just queue and go afk for free rewards. But if this was indeed the case, then there would be zero need for those good players to boost the scrubs.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the mount is also available in normal, heroic and mythic. And given that most &quot;good players&quot; will have a few decently geared alts, that means plenty of opportunity to devote as much time to grinding this mount as you need without having to resort to LFR.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to deny that it is an incentive. But it's a really weak one. At most it's enough to give someone who is ambivalent about LFR that small nudge to get them to queue. But anyone who claims to hate LFR, but queues for an extraneous shot at this mount is an idiot with only themself to blame.<br />

Your one-liners are patently incapable of backing anything up. Take a look at your recent post history. It's all the same. Snide one-line cheap shots that you never provide any backup for. And when someone challenges it, your first recourse is ad hominem. <br />

And yet it has even more rewards for top performers. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, even if true, your point holds zero relevance. Even if the game has more rewards than ever before that does not automatically mean it has too many. Secondly, this mount, and the discussion is about a LFR specific reward and the game does not reward a lot of mounts for doing LFR. <br />
<br />
<br />
You can like that of course but stop making shit up just your feelings dont get hurt<br />
<br />
Who says I like it? I am actually pretty ambivalent about it. I don't really do a lot of LFR and I most certainly won't be grinding it for the mount. I don't have to like LFR or participate in it to recognise the merit in having the mount drop from LFR though.</div></div><hr />

So it is no longer a reward because it is in 4 out of 4 raid difficulties. But it is still a reward when it is in 3 out of 4 raid difficulties. It has everything with being a special snowflake and an elitist. You want to exclude LFR from a reward simply because it is LFR. Go do Glory and get the mount. Go do Mythic Jania and get the mount.

Go do Glory and get the mount. Go do Mythic Jania and get the mount. There are rewards that are rewards.<br />
<br />
A RNG mount can be given to everyone. Players that are good have 4 lock outs to try for the mount. LFR, Normal, Heroic, and Mythic. The better you are the more chances you can have at it.<br />
<br />
hahaha, what did i say, cant discuss something like this without being called an elitist or special snowflake</div></div><hr />

You are saying that LFR shouldn't have a reward because it is LFR and it is bad game design to allow LFR players to have mounts. That is elitism at its finest. If you don't want to be called something then don't have an elitist opinion. It is that simple.</div></div><hr />

Or it's because LFR is mindless and shouldn't even be in the game in the first place. Normal is a cakewalk, LFR is for lazy people who don't want to try those people have been ruining and continue to ruin the game. Game was good when rewards actually felt like rewards, just because you pay $15 a month doesn't mean you deserve to be spoonfed gear, mounts etc get off your high horse you're the one being a &quot;snowflake&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Blah blah blah, who pays for the game? The LFR &quot;lazy people&quot;, not Mythic raiders. Basic economics, basic business.<br />
And I still fucking do not understand how other people's fun ruins MY game? Or yours? How? xD</div></div><hr />

LFR is the &quot;cater to casual&quot; mindset, which has been a thing since very end of WoTLK. Look at where that mindset has led the game?</div></div><hr />

okay tell me, where dose the line stop, how about i get a mount for just questing? how about a mount from pet battles? If i only pet battle i should be able to get everything everyone else gets right?<br />

my whole reasoning is that awesome rewards should be gated behind difficulty and time investment, thats how this game used to work....<br />

It's not worth it man, they don't understand. These are the same people who call others &quot;snowflake&quot; for wanting the game to have a decent reward system again. These people believe that, because they pay $15, Blizzard should be just spoonfeeding them easy content for whatever they want. It's the same people that complained about PvP rewards being too difficult to get. They believe that the game should cater to them, and they shouldn't have to put effort into anything within it because &quot;they don't have time&quot; which it's ironic as hell to want to play an MMO then complain about not having time.</div></div><hr />

I have a life, I do mythic battle twice a week for 3 hours each night so 6 total 8-11 est. If you cannot commit to raid schedule that's too bad I mean, it doesn't take much time at all that's just an excuse to hand out free shit. WoW is an MMO, what are MMOs known for? Time put into them, if you don't have the time(like I said even mythic raiding doesn't take much time at all) then don't get upset if you can't do certain content. Game has been ruined by this mindset, it's an MMO it's supposed to take some time and a little effort to play, game is in the state it's in because people like you just want to be spoonfed through content because they &quot;dont have the time&quot;.<br />
<br />
TLDR; Most people have the time, but don't want to put in the effort in learning how to actually play the game would rather have Blizzard spoonfeed them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eapoe</div><div class="date">2019-02-27, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it's being spiteful, stop trying to sugarcoat it. There is no benefit to making the raid take much longer, even for you. You don't even have to give it 100% attention, but crossing your arms and not contributing is just silly.<br />
<br />
Your logic:<br />
&quot;I'm going to try on one boss so I can get out of here as quickly as possible&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not going to do anything on 3 bosses and make the run take longer&quot;<br />
<br />
Alternatively, it would even make more sense for you to semi-afk until Jaina, actually try for that to speed it up, and get done quicker. But you'd rather cut your nose off to spite your face. You're hurting yourself, lol.<br />
<br />
As a counter-anecdote, I've kicked numerous players who've tried it in Antorus. Count yourself lucky, as all it takes is one person speaking up and someone initiating a kick.<br />
<br />
That had nothing to do with how other people play. That has everything to do with how you play. As you admitted, classes are easy. It would take relatively no effort to even do somewhat good on a boss. And doing so benefits you.<br />
<br />
How is it being spiteful? I’m not doing it to hurt anyone, or better yet, it hurts me just as much as others as it prolongs the experience. <br />
As stated, wanting to kill 1 boss and get out quickly makes me want to end it faster. Having to go thru 3 means even more of an activity I don’t want to do for a low chance at something. It’s a mentality issue. Let’s put it this way, your parents tell you to do your homework and then you can watch tv, you’ll probably get their your homework pretty quick/. If they tell you, finish your homework, take out the garbage, mow the lawn, give the dog a bath, do the laundry, and clean your room, you’re not going to approach that with the same zeal, are you? <br />
Anecdotal is anecdotal. My experiences on a personal matter are greater than yours. I’ve seen less people get kicked out of instance content than you have. It’s also pretty easy to appear like you are trying. <br />
Yet why would I bother to do good when I can not and still do better than most of the other people? Like you stated, LFR is easy, so why should I go out of my way to treat it like a mythic raid when others can’t or won’t do the same?</div></div><hr />

Seriously, grow up, dude. There's a lot of people who can't commit to a raid schedule for various reasons. Saying that those people don't deserve certain things purely because they don't properly raid is elitist as fuck. There's also a lot of servers that have no raiding presence. And the LFP shit is toxic. Everyone wants a carry and ask for ridiculous items levels and expecting people to have beaten the raid already in order to be taken to the raid. You got into a Mythic group? Lucky you. Most people can't find that kind of group. I'm one of those people because my server no longer has a big raiding presence. It's not spoonfeeding. It's a fucking MOUNT. It's not going to break the game. It's also probably a 1% drop rate. So just stfu about it and get over it.</div></div><hr />

Grow up? LOL said the guy with a Thanos Avatar. Oh man, you can't find a mythic group, that's usually because you're not playing properly btw. If your server is dead, transfer, omg wow game breaking solution. That's your OWN fault, you choose to be on that server.<br />
<br />
Elitist or not, it's the truth I'm sorry you can't handle that. LFR is a joke, you don't even have to try to complete it. If you don't have the time because RL, that sucks but that's life. Do you expect life to bend the way you want it just because you don't have time to commit to things? LFR should be a training mode raid if anything, it shouldn't reward you for anything BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING rofl. People like you are the true &quot;snowflakes&quot; thinking your entitled to things just because you pay $15 then when something is too difficult or it's hard to find people, you ask Blizzard to nerf it or make a new mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say you're not doing it to hurt anyone, but it does, and there's nothing to be gained, other than to tarnish the enjoyment of other players by doing so.<br />
<br />
It also doesn't matter if it hurts you or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
As stated, wanting to kill 1 boss and get out quickly makes me want to end it faster. Having to go thru 3 means even more of an activity I don’t want to do for a low chance at something.Then don't do it? It's still counter-intuitive to make your run take longer when in the same breath, you say how you wanted it done quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let’s put it this way, your parents tell you to do your homework and then you can watch tv, you’ll probably get their your homework pretty quick/. If they tell you, finish your homework, take out the garbage, mow the lawn, give the dog a bath, do the laundry, and clean your room, you’re not going to approach that with the same zeal, are you? If I want to watch TV, I'd speed it up as much as possible regardless of what was asked.<br />
<br />
And it's a pretty bad comparison regardless. The subject is about doing two more LFR bosses. With your comparison, that'd basically be the equivalent of doing your homework then taking out the trash. But sure, be extreme. That will definitely help you out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anecdotal is anecdotal. My experiences on a personal matter are greater than yours.<br />
No, it's not, not in the context of this. You can't use an anecdote as a counterpoint while dismissing other people's anecdotes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet why would I bother to do good when I can not and still do better than most of the other people? Like you stated, LFR is easy, so why should I go out of my way to treat it like a mythic raid when others can’t or won’t do the same?There are people who spend 2 hours doing M+ Shrine of the Storms. Why don't you take 2 hours to do it from now on?<br />
<br />
The answer is glaringly obvious. You want to get it out of the way as fast as possible. That's what you don't seem to be getting. For someone claiming that they wanted to get out asap, which is why you were originally trying, now you're complaining that it takes longer, when you yourself are causing to be even longer than it needs to be.<br />
<br />
In fact, this attitude of yours makes me highly doubt you weren't already AFK'ing. If that's truly the mentality you go by, why treat High Tinker like a mythic raid when others can't or won't do the same.<br />
<br />
I also never stated that you should treat it like a Mythic Raid, so good job on being extreme yet again.<br />
<br />
Your logic just doesn't make sense outside of spitefulness.</div></div><hr />

We could say the same thing about you though. By your logic, the mount should be mythic only. If not, they are catering / spoonfeeding people who do normal as normal is almost as much a joke as LFR is this tier.</div></div><hr />

I mean, that's fine I'd be ok with that if I wanted to I'd try to get it but I also do mythic raiding so. Problem is, people don't want to put any effort in and want to be handheld through content because instead of learning how to play they expect difficulties to bend to to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You fail to take into account that people's lives change. I've played since beta bro. I led vanilla progression guilds. We raided 5 days a week 6 hours a day. I did that all the way through BC. I was a single guy working a 10 hour job. No worries. Eventually you have to grow up. Not everyone is method or has the time to dedicate to to mythic raiding. I have a wife and a newborn now. I can't be glued to WoW loser style like I did when I was 20. Not everyone has the time to dedicate 3-4 hours a night. I hop in every now and then and do some old school raids or A normal / heroic run, but thats about it.<br />
<br />
Id like the mount, regardless of how I obtain it. If I don't get it this expac I will farm it next expac solo. Mounts shouldn't matter where they come from. There is no difficulty in clicking the boss and getting said mount. People should do the content that they can do and have fun doing it. I have never understood why it matters to you where I got what mount or xmog piece or pet lol.</div></div><hr />

Normal is a cakewalk, LFR is for lazy people who don't want to try those people have been ruining and continue to ruin the game. Game was good when rewards actually felt like rewards, just because you pay $15 a month doesn't mean you deserve to be spoonfed gear, mounts etc get off your high horse you're the one being a &quot;snowflake&quot;.<br />
<br />
And yet you call normal a cakewalk. If LFR was not the lowest then the new &quot;spoon fed&quot; difficulty would be normal. You would think though that after 8 years of a game being ruined you would have stopped caring long ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course they should. You forget though. Their are different skill sets. I am a GM in Overwatch. I was a pro cs player from 1.0 to 1.6 and in cs:s. Id mop you up in a shooter. I'd more than likely beat you in basketball (6'8&quot;, played college ball). Im sure there are things you could beat me at as well. There are some players that are good enough to do mythic raids and there are some that have no business ever doing them from a skill standpoint.<br />
<br />
Varying sets of skill shouldnt stop you from getting a mount. Your reward from harder content is the different skinned mount and the titles that come with it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rhorle</div><div class="date">2019-02-27, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay tell me, where dose the line stop, how about i get a mount for just questing? how about a mount from pet battles? If i only pet battle i should be able to get everything everyone else gets right? my whole reasoning is that awesome rewards should be gated behind difficulty and time investment, thats how this game used to work.... serisously....<br />
<br />
So no one in the game can get a mount outside of raiding because raiders need to feel like special snow flakes? You can get mounts from questing. What game have you been playing? Clearly it isn't WoW. You can get mounts from pet battles. Do you even know the game? Your whole argument is that LFR shouldn't get a mount simply because it is LFR.<br />
<br />
Normal does not have a large time or difficulty investment. Yet it drops the mount. You are acting like an elitist just because it is LFR. There is nothing wrong with a mount that drops in certain difficulties but not others. There is also nothing wrong with a mount that drops in all difficulties. You have yet to provide any reason beyond &quot;its LFR&quot;. The game still rewards things based on time investment and difficulty.<br />
<br />
It also still rewards people based on luck with out much difficulty or time investment. Just like Midnight. It wasn't that hard to do the first boss of Karazahn and yet it rewarded a mount. It still does. You are making a stand like LFR having a mount changes fundamental things about the game. It doesn't though. It just makes you look like a snowflake that can't handle more people have access to a non-prestigious mount in the first place.</div></div><hr />

just to be clear, my point is not NOT to have rewards for other skill sets and peole who dont have time, but those rewards should be tuned for those types of players. I welcome all kinds of players, but for lower skill set players to all of a sudden have the same access to something that wouldve previously been only for high skill set players, then the wohle reward system becomes flawed imo. <br />
<br />
its like someone who studied hard and become knowledgeable finally gets his PhD<br />
but then someone who didnt study at all, and didnt try at all, is is clearly less knowledgelable gets the same PhD<br />

Rewards are turned though. You get gear as your reward. You get the satisfaction and thrill of the kill when you defeat a more difficult boss. The mount going to others in LFR doesnt change your gameplay at all. Hell you couldn't even tell who got what from where if you saw 10 people on the same mount lol.<br />
<br />
Throwing yourself at a brick wall over and over doesnt = the same as getting a PhD. Thie equal of one throwing themselves at the same wall over and over is the same as, well, throwing yourself at a wall over and over.</div></div><hr />

okay for everoyne disagreeing.<br />

back in wotlk, in icc, defeating lich hc 25 man dropped invincible. Whenever u saw that mount you became amazed and one day would wish to have that mount. You know it was special because it was hard to get. <br />

<br />
Why are you getting so angry? Clearly I've hit a nerve and have you aptly labeled. Your example is flawed. GMOD is not similar to Invincible. Jania's Mythic only mount is similar to Invincible. Which is only available from Mythic. Again you are saying that LFR can't have a mount drop because it is LFR. Even though normal drops it and Heroic drops it.<br />
<br />
Invincible was a guaranteed drop mount, not a RNG mount, prior to 4.0. It was Heroic 25 only. That is the problem. You are assigning the incorrect status to this mount. It isn't a prestigious reward for doing content. It is just a random mount drop from a boss in an instance. It should be on every difficulty.<br />
<br />
This is nothing new. Mounts have dropped as just &quot;random loot&quot; from a boss before. And yet you are literally raging over this being available to LFR. Using any lie you can to justify it. Not every mount rewarded needs to be a prestigious reward from content. Not to mention there is nothing prestigious or awe-inspiring from getting the mount on Normal mode. <br />
<br />
Now if you were talking about the Glacial Tidestorm being given to LFR (or even normal and heroic) you would have a point. But you don't and never will. No matter how many capital letters and swear words you use.</div></div><hr />

Again, by your logic, the mount should only exist in the hardest difficulty, which is mythic. Im fine with that. Are you?<br />
<br />
I dunno why you can't be happy with the content you do and let others worry about what they want to do. If LFR heroes get a mount, how does it change how you play?</div></div><hr />

Are you aware that there is a Mount that drops from the last boss on Mythic? Or do we need to use WotLK as an example of many mounts not being limited to highest difficulty of PvE?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now imagine u did lfr ICC assuming it existed, and it dropped.Now imagine you did LFR BfD and the Water Elemental mount dropped.<br />

Sure back in the day I saw BeepBop the Noble riding on Invincible every day because servers had a community and BeepBop and his heroics were recognized. But today? Hah!

That is a deflection, not an answer to my question. And I do not see how LFR has been the reason for the game issues. Once more, casuals pay for the game, not hardcore gamers. LFR is for casuals, it doesnt take time to set up, it can be done anytime, there is no need to organise anything, but they get to see the raids, which are the endgame. How, again, that impacts you?

But why is that a problem? You just said that the &quot;casuals&quot; just want rewards. So the non-casuals shouldn't care about rampant power inflation because they are in it for more then just the rewards. You can't have it both ways. I think it is pretty clear that plenty of people are in it just for the rewards. Now that rewards are widely accessible to all sorts of players those who just care about the rewards are whining.<br />
<br />
Because they are no longer special for having rewards. If they want to be special they actually have to do Mythic raids to get the special rewards. Otherwise they are just like everyone else. And as you say it is creating havoc on the game proper. Because these so called &quot;hardcore&quot; players are not getting rewards that those they see as inferior can't get.</div></div><hr />

Oh noes, casuuuuls got more gear. End of life, I guess. Sure, Blizzard screwed up with the numbers (as the most quoted +15 ilvl should have been enough), but again, why that matters?

We should at least have mounts drop in normal. Many guilds don't clear the last wing of Heroic, fewer make it to mythic.<br />

So you just want rewards and you don't want to play the game. You are exactly what you called the problem with the game and those who only do LFR. Funny how you insult yourself but still somehow think you are better then others.</div></div><hr />

A weird personal level? You are the one that said LFR people just want rewards with out playing the game and here you are saying you want rewards with out having to play the rest of the game. And yet everything you say makes you fit that label perfectly. The game hasn't changed to cater to Facebook gamers. Clearly you have never played a facebook game if you honestly believe that.<br />

If you had it your way you'd be perfectly happy with a vendor selling you every item in the game, practically spoon feeding everyone and anyone with things they desire. The fact LFR even drops a mount is beyond a joke considering you can just AFK the whole time. It's the same with warfronts too.<br />

You don't have to run a bunch of afkable content to run mythic. You want a reward (mythic) with out having to play the game (everything else). That is exactly what you said LFR players want. To run LFR with out doing anything else and get rewards. If my argument is nonsensical then it shows just how dumb yours was to begin with.

There hasn't been 1 raid difficulty in over a decade. You weren't part of any mythic race on one difficulty, because there was no mythic race. It's been 12 years since Burning Crusade and 1 raid difficulty. So you weren't part of any race for very long at all. We aren't going back to one raid difficulty.<br />

You also don't need to grind AFK content to do mythic.

Oh, BS. I'm fairly deep in Mythic and I play maybe 1 hour/day tops outside of raid days obviously. You absolutely don't have to no-life to play in that.

You can't afk your way to maximum artifact power though so it doesn't apply. Is still stands that you want the rewards of mythic with out having to play the rest of the game. Just like you said LFR players want the rewards of the rest of the game with out having to do it.<br />
<br />
You don't need a super large HoA in order to do Mythic raids. More people have downed the first 3 mythic raids then are above level 44 for their Heart of Azeroth. It is easy enough to unlock 3 rings for Season 2 if you have been doing minimal effort since launch. This isn't Legion.</div></div><hr />

There have been literal afk groups on islands to farm pet,mount,transmog... yes you have to hit &quot;a&quot; spell button but to pretend that is compelling is disingenuous to the extreme.<br />
<br />
I have no interest in doing terrible content to play the interesting content. I've cleared every raid when current on the highest difficulty from tbc to wod playing nine hours a week with a odd quick log in to play the ah. I despise these changes made to cater to no lifers who want to grind garbage because they are either terrible at the game or have zero social skills to actually progress with groups.</div></div><hr />

Most mythic raiding guilds who kill Jaina will farm her for 20+ weeks in order to make sure all of their raiders get the mount. That makes it RNG if you will get it. When the raid becomes old content it will go to 1% drop rate.</div></div><hr />

So what happens when all 3 people AFK? So you want rewards with out having to play the game. Gotcha. Again we are back to what you were whining was so terrible about LFR players. You can still be perfectly prepared for Mythic BfA raids by playing nine hours a week. So here we are. You have said you AFK group content because it is beneath you. That is displaying zero social skills because you are not working with the group and a terrible player. Doing four islands that can be done in less then an hour is not grinding.<br />
<br />
Hell if all 3 players actually try it goes by quicker then if one afk's or barely tries. We all know what kind of player you are and these &quot;LFR trash&quot; as you say are better for the game then you ever will be.<br />

It takes longer to lose all of the island expeditions. You said you have to grind AFK content and that you are a mythic raider. So you were at the keyboard for this so-called afk content? And now it comes out that you don't even play the game anymore. Yet here you are discussing it, judging other players, and whining that 4 out of 4 difficulties get a mount.

LFR is made for the sake of Lore. It is meant to allow people who don't raid to still see the content. LFR is not a raid. It should not drop gear and it should definitely not drop a mount.</div></div><hr />

Oh you mean like badges of justice and Mechanaar farms? You are the one that came here saying that LFR doesn't deserve things. You can't call someone an entitled brat when you came here to specifically argue that LFR doesn't deserve things because. If you don't enjoy playing the game that is fine. But you shouldn't expect the rewards of the game when you don't want to play all of the game.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has always required end-game players to do other stuff in the game. Flasks, Feasts, Attunements, badges, valor, dailies for rep, etc. They are literally not nickel and dimeing you because it costs nothing extra. If you are going to insult someone and call them a brat at least you expressions correctly. The same amount of time you spent before you can spend now to raid Mythic. <br />
