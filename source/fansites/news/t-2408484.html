It's definitely 10, but it's still not that impressive due to mythic gear and the artifact levels right now.</div></div><hr />

We were scaled down to 10. The main difficult thing about it was dealing with mechanics and berserk timer that were designed with more people in mind, such as blight being constantly on everyone, our healer having to swap with the tank at certain times, warlock having the tank buff in p2 and dealing with healer's bomb, etc. It was a ton of fun to figure out and do! :D</div></div><hr />

Yes, let's not forget them. Hard to forget because it was impressive, just as this is impressive. So I'm sure you won't forget this, either.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing your videos, being this is so easy. And BTW, it's not. You have to invent brand new strategies to deal with the mechanics that were designed for 10+ people. It takes creativity and a ton of patience.</div></div><hr />

I used VB, rune tap (with talent ring), Diima's trinket and Ironbark from druid for the second slice each time, as well as IBF when it was up. Used talent ring and belt as legendaries, though belt is pretty useless since you won't really get to use the extra VBs, would definitely have used shoulders if I had them. It was very important that my stacks dropped before taking the technique as taking a slash with 16 stacks is pretty scary. Was around 965 ilvl so not amazing gear but more than enough. Honestly Argus was much harder to tank, as the healer wasn't always around to taunt and let me drop stacks since she also had to deal with soulbombs.<br />

Considering Onyxia in Vanilla didn't even have an enrage, was not tuned for 40 people, and that these guys didn't need the talents of the next expansion to defeat these two (Aggramar and Argus), this is much more impressive</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isnt hard though... aggramar's difficulty comes from sustained heals something that isn't a issue in such a small group and actively becomes easier.<br />
<br />
Argus on heroic is a dps check. It just seems weird for this to be on the front page is isn't even as difficult as a normal mythic kill if your above 970.<br />

I do content tuned for 30 people with a 10 man group all the time.</div></div><hr />

You do content tuned for 30 people with a 10 man group all the time? Think about what you just said for a second.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're doing it with 10 man group then it's tuned for 10 people.</div></div><hr />

I feel bad for you. You have to live your life with a brain that doesn't function correctly.<br />
Carry groups bring in 10 geared raiders, and 20 buyers who do nothing during the fight other than sit there or die.<br />
Them dying or not doing anything doesn't change how the boss is still scaled for 30 people.</div></div><hr />

It's not. And I'm not sure you realize just how easy it is to clear heroic with 975-980 ilvl people.<br />
<br />
I mean, even patchwork was solo'd by a rogue when it was current content. But that was more about him shadow stepping to a rat in the sewer pipe and waiting for evasion to come back up. There's all kinds of gimmick things people have done. But in this case, it's more about just over gearing it by a lot.</div></div><hr />

It's not. It's also not that hard to do when all the carriers are like 980.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Argus on heroic is a dps check. It just seems weird for this to be on the front page is isn't even as difficult as a normal mythic kill if your above 970.<br />

We just know how the game works... saying this is impressive when it doesn't hold a candle to 10 people carrying another 10 buyers seems just weird..<br />
<br />
Oh, its the we sell raids people. My god you guys are like the grunt workers digging a hole telling me how hard it is to do. Good job carrying 10 people I'm sure those 10 people just afk out and don't do any DPS, do any of the mechanics, and I'm sure you guys do both fights with one tank for fun.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you guys are so much smarter than every other player. Yeah, we all understand on paper how it can be done. This is WoW nothing crazy. Doesn't mean the execution is going to be simple everytime.<br />
<br />
You could post a video of you doing this for me real quick since it isn't impressive or hard. I'll wait.</div></div><hr />

It is time consuming so no im not going to... I don't really understand why you think this is some grand feat.</div></div><hr />

You could just look at warcraft logs right now. Since they've been cleared most of the top heroic parses are set by people doing carries.<br />
Or just search for logs with the name &quot;carry&quot; in them, as a lot of people call them that.</div></div><hr />
