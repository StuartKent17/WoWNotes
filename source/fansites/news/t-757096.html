<br />
To answer your question check this out -<br />
<br />
Should the spirits give their blessing to Vol'jin, Champion Uru'zin will call for all seasoned veterans of the Horde levels 75-80 to aid in the attack. If &quot;at last, everythin' be ready,&quot; as Vol'jin put it, his plan is to launch a full assault from the shores of Sen'jin village. <br />

<br />
Two slightly unfortunate things: the &quot;overcloak&quot; idea is gone (the reward doesn't change the skin of your existing cloak, it's a white quality cloak by itself -- although with a nice pattern). Also, low-level Zalazane is still on the island aferward. Seems like they would have phased it, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

Now that I've read a few reports saying that the overcloaks were replaced with plain white item style cloaks that you have to equip in lieu of your epic cloak, frankly I have no motivation to renew until Cata. We'll see if the overcloaks end up being a reward for the cultist quests, or another phase of these quests altogether, but right now I'm pretty disappointed.</div></div><hr />

It's starting with regular intervals like battle for undercity/light's hope. You quest with others, but it's phased, so people not on the quest can't see the event.</div></div><hr />

An at the most 30 minute event just doesn't cut it for me. Not to mention it's bugged on 2 servers (horde) that I play on (second boss, traitor guy, is evading)<br />
I dunno but waiting this long for a 30 minute event(with 15 minutes of waiting) with an statless cloak ( nice looking though)as a reward wouldn't be worth renewing my account for. Not to me at least, but to each his own.<br />

Do you have a source from where your supposedly read this? It's stupid if they release the first new content since ICC and it only lasts 1 day.<br />

Yeah but still meaning &quot;the last major patch before 4.0&quot; - they may name it 3.9 indeed, or they just used that number since they didn't know whether they had to push out a 3.4 to bridge the time or not.</div></div><hr />

My personal oppinion: Horde version totally sucks, both pre-quests and the operation itself. Alliance is enjoyable, you ride things, shoot thing etc. plus it takes longer, Horde is terrible really...

Pretty sure this is the first of several prologue events. We haven't had any direct Twilight Cult or Deathwing related events yet. You know the actual antagonists for the expansion. Opening of the Dark Portal was all about Doom Lord Kazzak and High Lord Kruul (I think Kruul was there). The Scourge event was all about the min Naxxramas' and that one boss in Karazhan (so pissed I missed getting my arcanite reaper HOOOO!!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
The opening of the dark portal and the scourge invasion had a few events.<br />
<br />
This is definitely the first of many events.<br />
<br />
Probably have to beat on some underling of Cho'gall or possibly Nefarian before cata is finally released.<br />
<br />
<br />

Based on previosu experience, i would imagine there is a large content patch, prior to cata's release which introduces the new talent trees and professions (much like there was prior to wrath's release) which will also have some big cata event to do with the either Deathwing, twilight's hammer, the old gods, or possibly all three.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true. Completing epic quest chains in the end zones is what they were talking about, which IMO is the definition of the exact opposite of &quot;brainless grind&quot;. <br />
<br />
Who will suffer though is those who prefer the brainless grind over completing the quests on their way to 85, which, while it will get you to 85, will not get you rep and blue quest reward gear.<br />
<br />
I am a very happy puppy for Blizz making once more CONTENT actually meaningful not just something you skip over because you get free epics in heroics the day after you ding 85. The probhlem with WoLK was that Blizz made content so easy that most people could skip most of it, and then started whining there wasn't enough content.</div></div><hr />

We haven't had any direct Twilight Cult or Deathwing related events yet. You know the actual antagonists for the expansion. Opening of the Dark Portal was all about Doom Lord Kazzak and High Lord Kruul (I think Kruul was there). The Scourge event was all about the min Naxxramas' and that one boss in Karazhan (so pissed I missed getting my arcanite reaper HOOOO!!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
The opening of the dark portal and the scourge invasion had a few events.<br />
<br />
This is definitely the first of many events.<br />
<br />
Probably have to beat on some underling of Cho'gall or possibly Nefarian before cata is finally released.<br />

Not likely. Seting it high to begin with is very first step for nerfing it later.

Yes and no. It's a pre-launch event, but it's for the pre-expansion patch (patch 4.0.x), rather than for the expansion itself (lvl85 content etc). And yes, this will be taken by many as an indication that patch 4.0 may be coming fairly soon(tm) after the event ends, though there maybe another event after. When patch 4.0 goes live, it'll bring all the new eastern kingdoms and kalimdor 1-60 content, so we'll have plenty to do between patch day and the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect. 3.9 will launch with new spells and talents and interfaces and all that jazz. At that point, the background downloader will start downloading the new world. Then, after a series of build-up events, the actual Cataclysm will happen 1-2 weeks before the expansion launch. At that point, Blizzard will simply restart the servers and we'll have our new world. 4.0 won't launch until the expansion launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this stage, I very, VERY much doubt that'll happen. Talent trees and spell co-efficients aren't 100% ready yet, so they're not being implemented onto live this month. October is next month, and i'd expect patch 4.0 to go live at the end of October (20th, or 27th perhaps) for a November (pre-Xmas) launch. This means that if there IS a 3.9 patch, it'll need to go live on... the 13th of October. There simply isn't time on either end to have it go live at any other time. Not unless they cut this event VERY short indeed.<br />

Word. The technology for shapeshifts to override, but not overwrite other shapeshifts is there, e.g. use Frenzyheart Brew before going into combat while wearing DBW, and you will see yourself as a Taunka/Vrykul/Iron Dwarf while having the proc up, but your shape returns to Wolvar.<br />
Druid shapeshifts could override costumes* while not removing their buff, so it becomes active again when the druid unshifts.<br />
<br />
* Since it's apparently still more important that any enemy knows what form we're in than for them to see the gear of any costumed player.</div></div><hr />

Now that I've read a few reports saying that the overcloaks were replaced with plain white item style cloaks that you have to equip in lieu of your epic cloak, frankly I have no motivation to renew until Cata. We'll see if the overcloaks end up being a reward for the cultist quests, or another phase of these quests altogether, but right now I'm pretty disappointed.<br />
I'm most certain that they are white just for now, because the &quot;overcloaking&quot; feature is not implemented yet. When pre-Cata patch hits, these white cloaks will become usable for &quot;overcloaking&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I can't find the page now but on the WoW site it specifically said these events were in the &quot;3.9&quot; patch. And as we know we are still in 3.3.5 and it is now live. I watched the interview with Tom Chilton from Gamescon and the interviewer asked if the new talents and world changes would be coming out in patch 3.9. Tom Chilton said &quot;3.9 or whatever that patch is numerically designated&quot;. And yet World of Raids summary of that interview stated &quot;Patch 3.9 will be the pre-release patch.&quot; My guess based on what has happened so far and by Tom Chilton's statement is that we will not have a 3.9 patch and that 4.0 will be the big patch that we are used to seeing before an expansion.</div></div><hr />

Oh pleeease, give me a break kid. <br />
<br />
They're not forcing you to repeatedly kill one single mob for a week straight before you're *allowed* to enter a dungeon (or be revered like the old model to run heroic versions). They're bringing back the model that should have been implemented at the BEGINNING of WoTLK, which is run dungeons and finish quest chains, then run heroics until you're finally geared out for raids. It's called progression, and for those of you who were babied by the accessibility of WoTLK, toughen up. I'm sure Blizzard will implement badge loot that jumps tiers of content just like last time, you just have to wait until the next patch release (when they'll probably nerf heroics, anyway).<br />
<br />
Besides, what so few of you WoTLK new-comers realize, is how easily CC will negate any difficulty increase. I personally run with a prot warrior, a warlock, boomkin and either myself healing on my paladin, or myself dpsing on my mage while another friend runs his priest, shadow or disc, respectively. That's fear/seduce, cyclone/roots, stun/sheep and when it calls for it, shackle. If we have any problems whatsoever, it'll be due to our warrior going ape shit thinking he can AoE tank everything like he did last expansion (a problem I can see happening in the RDF very early on).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yazus</div><div class="date">2010-09-08, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.<br />
<br />
1) People are not used to &quot;quest chains&quot; anymore. In Cata, every zone is a big single quest chain. So by finishing a zone, you have probably got yourself to honored/revered. Just sayin'. Unlocking dailies and you are nearly at 80% of your work.<br />
2) Tol Barad rep gives you epic trinkets and starter blue weapons. This means from 80 to 85 you should Join tol barad and try to get yourself to complete as most dailies as you can.<br />
3) Heroics will grant you starter equipments for raids<br />
4) Remember about professions and starter epics<br />
5) Dont forget about Emblmem also.<br />
<br />
It will be fairly easier, but a little bit harder and &quot;calculated&quot; than in WOTLK. I will actually feel like a journey</div></div><hr />

This isn't the prologue for Cataclysm. If you followed this site at all, you would certainly know that this is just the first set of events.<br />

It is true that the cloak rewards had overcloak functionality when these events were up on the public test realms some months back. In the end we decided that implementing the cloaks in such a way that players could aesthetically change the cloak they're wearing could set a bad precedent. We like customization and flavor items, but we don't want to start implementing aesthetic items in the game which allow players to look however they want while keeping all the stats they want. We felt the overcloaks were breaking that barrier a little too much.</div></div><hr />

It is true that the cloak rewards had overcloak functionality when these events were up on the public test realms some months back. In the end we decided that implementing the cloaks in such a way that players could aesthetically change the cloak they're wearing could set a bad precedent. We like customization and flavor items, but we don't want to start implementing aesthetic items in the game which allow players to look however they want while keeping all the stats they want. We felt the overcloaks were breaking that barrier a little too much.<br />

This is extremely disappointing, but at least they let us know. I honestly won't be renewing my account now until Cataclysm since there really isn't an item I just have to have - the Darkspear Pride item is BoP so it won't turn into something you can eventually sell for a thousand gold or more (like the Haunted Memento from the pre-WotLK event) and the cloak is also BoP and a crappy version of the original overcloak we were teased with, so all in all you get an achievement and about forty-five minutes of fun.</div></div><hr />

Wait what? When the events were on the 3.3.5 PTR, the rewards already were the same normal cloak items as today. Overcloaks were merely datamined by Boub.</div></div><hr />

Talent trees and spell co-efficients aren't 100% ready yet, so they're not being implemented onto live this month. October is next month, and i'd expect patch 4.0 to go live at the end of October (20th, or 27th perhaps) for a November (pre-Xmas) launch. This means that if there IS a 3.9 patch, it'll need to go live on... the 13th of October. There simply isn't time on either end to have it go live at any other time. Not unless they cut this event VERY short indeed.<br />

If they hold back this positive change because people might expect even more changes, what change can you actually implement?<br />
<br />
Overcloaks would be great as Back is not among the &quot;show your progress&quot; slots like Head and Shoulder, it even has maybe 3 or 4 &quot;models&quot; only.</div></div><hr />

That is our model for Cataclysm.&quot;<br />
