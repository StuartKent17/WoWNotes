The Brood Mother Returns<br />
After years of lurking in her lair battling the many brave adventurers who travelled from afar to challenge her, Onyxia returns stronger than before to commemorate World of Warcraft’s five-year anniversary.<br />
<br />
Onyxia has been scaled to offer new challenges to level 80 players and is now available for testing in 10- and 25-player modes.<br />
Adjusted for modern raiding, but with the fundamental experience of fighting the Brood Mother still in effect, including the horrors of her Deep Breaths!<br />
Onyxia will now drop level 80 item versions of some classic loot items from the level 60 encounter.<br />
Brood of Onyxia, a very rare 310%-speed mount modeled after Onyxia herself will be available for the luckiest of challengers.<br />
<br />
General<br />
Armor Penetration Rating: The amount of armor penetration gained per point of this rating has been reduced by 12%.<br />
Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
Players level 11 and higher will now always see a daily Battleground quest, as the quest giver will only offer daily quests for a Battleground in which a player is eligible to participate according to level bracket (i.e. players levels 11-20 will always be offered a Warsong Gulch daily quest, while players levels 11-50 will be offered either an Arathi Basin or a Warsong Gulch daily quest, etc.).<br />

I believe this prevents idol/libram/totem/sigil swapping so you can't have an idol out, gain the buff from it, switch idols and gain another buff from the 2nd idol</div></div><hr />

no. from what ive read, that change is intended to stop people swapping out their relic once it has procced'. i.e. my Totem of Electrifying Wind procs, and i quickly swap in another totem, they wont both be active</div></div><hr />

* Players level 11 and higher will now always see a daily Battleground quest, as the quest giver will only offer daily quests for a Battleground in which a player is eligible to participate according to level bracket (i.e. players levels 11-20 will always be offered a Warsong Gulch daily quest, while players levels 11-50 will be offered either an Arathi Basin or a Warsong Gulch daily quest, etc.).<br />

I don't care if it procs sacks of gold - if it removes the Arcane Blast buff, then its a valueless ability.<br />

Mail System Auto-Complete Feature<br />
The inline auto-complete feature for the mail system has been added back into the game. The mail system will now have both the pre- and post-3.2.0 auto-complete features available.<br />
Added a label to notify players that the Tab key will allow players to navigate through the character names listed via the auto-complete feature.<br />

Bug Fixes<br />
Coliseum Trinkets: Some spells that should have triggered these trinkets will now trigger them (such as Holy Nova and Fel Armor).<br />
Death Knight Tier-9 DPS 4-Piece Set Bonus: Now grants the correct chance for disease damage ticks to be critical strikes.<br />
Hunter Tier-9 2-Piece Set Bonus: Critical damage from Serpent Sting will now work properly with the Mortal Shots and Expose Weakness talents.<br />
Lightweave Embroidery: This tailoring item enhancement will no longer trigger from the periodic healing granted by the warlock spell Fel Armor.<br />
Mote of Flame: Corrected a typo in the tooltip.<br />
Paladin Tier-9 DPS 2-Piece Set Bonus: Now grants the correct chance for Righteous Vengeance ticks to be critical strikes.<br />
Shard of Flame: Corrected a typo in the tooltip.<br />
Val’anyr, Hammer of The Ancient Kings: Healing from Prayer of Mending now triggers the shield from this item. In addition, a bug was corrected which would cause the shield points to be overwritten rather than stack up as intended.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Rune of Razorice: The frost vulnerability granted by this enchantment will now increase the damage done by Frost Fever as intended.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Balance of Power: Misleading tooltip reworded. The tooltip previously reported an incorrect value for the increased chance to hit with spells. The actual benefit of the talent is unchanged.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Master's Call: This ability now correctly removes the snaring component of Infected Wounds, Frostfire Bolt, and Slow.<br />
Trap Mastery’s (Survival) tooltip now states the correct amount of snakes summoned.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />

<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Divine Aegis: Ranks 1 and 2 will now work with Holy Nova.<br />
Glyph of Power Word: Shield now correctly uses the Priest’s spell critical chance instead of the target’s.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Vanish: This ability now correctly removes the snaring component of Frostfire Bolt.<br />
Honor Among Thieves: This talent will now work properly again if two rogues with different ranks of the talent are in the same party.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Grounding Totem will now properly protect against the Death Grip spell.<br />
Lava Burst can no longer deal critical damage to targets who are immune to critical strikes (due to, e.g. Roar of Sacrifice, Blessed Resilience).<br />
Lightning Shield: This spell will no longer set off some trinkets when it is cast.<br />
Stoneclaw Totem's pulses will no longer break stealth on nearby hostile units.<br />
Thunderstorm and Shamanistic Rage can no longer be used while Frozen, Cycloned, Sapped, or Incapacitated.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
Demonic Circle: This ability now correctly removes the snaring component of Frostfire Bolt.<br />
Fel Armor: This spell was unable to set off trinkets and other effects. That has been corrected.<br />

/pat, you can come sit with me, the elemental shaman in the back. Our AoE abilities are weak as well. I don't play a rogue but I'm sure there is a reason for the damage reduction. Sucks more for PvE that the interrupt is gone.</div></div><hr />

Yes rogue's hitting 12k dps on AoE encounters is fine, with even the &quot;real&quot; AoE classes falling behind 3-5k.<br />

I did! Almost, anyway... I was able to have a GM send it back. <br />
<br />
I have a question about the pets. Linked in the news post are only the spells for most of them. Are the actual items in game that teach you how to summon them, or just the spells? I went to MC to see if I would maybe get lucky and find one on a Core Hound or Magmadar, but none of them dropped it. Maybe Ragnaros will drop it?</div></div><hr />

Actually the way i did it was......<br />
<br />
Had 1 Rogue (me)<br />
Warrior Tank<br />
2 Feral Druids<br />
and an enhance shammy<br />
So yes no healer<br />
<br />
shammy pops hero right off the bat<br />
<br />
I got the first kick in<br />
then he was down within 15 sec<br />
so yes this method requires high dps and a well geared tank but its alot easier in the sense that you only need one maybe 2 interrupt</div></div><hr />
