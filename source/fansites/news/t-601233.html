We don't know yet how many players will be required to complete Zul'aman, actually we're not even sure it will be a level 70 instance. When the Burning Crusade was announced it was supposed to be a low level raid instance at the end of the Blood Elves starting zone but it was &quot;changed&quot; to a level 70 instance, even if some people assume it will be made for 20 players raid, the success of Karazhan makes a 10 players version possible. <br />

http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/zulaman/zulaman_gamefiles_small.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/210/zulaman/zulaman_gamefiles.jpg)Basically the instance is like Zul'gurub, it's a huge outdoor area with multiple temples dedicated to Loa Gods (http://www.wowwiki.com/Loa_Gods). We already know the appearance of two of them or at least two monsters related to them, the Eagle God, and the Dragonhawk God.<br />

<br />
From the list of the files already available in game, we can also assume there is a Bear God and a Lynx God. <br />

<br />
<br />
According to the files (again), the final boss should be Zul'jin (from Warcraft II), but the first informations released about Zul'aman also mentionned Warlord Jin'zakk, who is &quot;A massive gray-furred Forest Troll with huge claws. He practices Dark Voodoo.&quot;<br />
