MMO-Champion Warcraft III: Reforged Interview<br />
During Blizzcon, MMO-Champion got to sit down with Brian Sousa and Pete Stillwell to ask some questions about Warcraft III: Reforged !<br />
Beta<br />
<br />
There will be a beta before release. There is no set date yet, but most likely in the spring.<br />
The beta will most likely focus on zones that have changed since Warcraft III in WoW, such as the Culling of Stratholme.<br />
<br />
Changes and Additions<br />
<br />
Dalaran and other iconic places will look more like they do in WoW.<br />
There are no plans for new campaigns that were not in the original game.<br />
All in game cutscenes are being completely redone and use a new camera system for the editor.<br />
The redone cutscenes will focus in on characters as they talk instead of having to have pop up dialogue.<br />
Cinematics other than the one seen at Blizzcon will be cleaned up at a higher resolution, but not 100% redone.<br />
The team thought it was important not to change the game engine and this is what caused them to create a render engine on top of the existing game for Reforged.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The team thought it was important to incorporate a way for people who play WoW to be invited to come see the origins stories for the game.<br />
The story will be fundamentally the same, but the team wants to also develop characters that were secondary such as Sylvanas and Jaina. <br />
Christie Golden has come in to help clean up the dialogue.<br />
Some of the dialogue in the original game was meant as placeholder but was sent to be voice acted.<br />
There were so many ideas that didn't quite make the original game and this is an opportunity to develop them.<br />
<br />
Community and Map Editor<br />
<br />
The map editor will incorporate Lua support and larger maps.<br />
Some of the people working on Reforged were hired out of the Warcraft III community.<br />
The art tools should be available sometime before release for map creators along with guides on how to use them.<br />
Warcraft III was selected to be reforged over the other two because of the community demand.<br />
There are no official Esports additions planned right now.<br />
The team is focused on making sure the UI is helpful for watching the game, however.<br />
<br />
Development<br />
<br />
The game has been in development for about two years.<br />
Starcraft: Remastered helped the team develop and grow for this project.<br />
Animation timing was the biggest restriction for the team because while the models are updated, they can't change the timing for the animations.<br />
Each unit, such as murlocs, will look slightly different.<br />
There are no plans for a physical copy of the Spoils of War addition at this time.<br />
<br />
Balance Changes<br />
<br />
Balanced is based off of community feedback.<br />
The team wants all heroes and units to be balanced better.<br />
Small map advantages are being addressed as well.<br />
<br />
Audio and Dialogue<br />
<br />
All dialogue is being rerecorded and utilizing the voice actors from WoW.<br />
There will be 13 different languages available.<br />
<br />
Custom Games<br />
<br />
There will be better filtering for custom games.<br />
The 12 unit selection cap will not be removed.<br />
Custom games are utilizing cloud service.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Forbes' How Women Came to Rule the World of Warcraft Interview<br />
Forbes recently posted an article (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/11/26/how-women-came-to-rule-the-world-of-warcraft/) interviewing Lydia Bottegoni, the senior vice president of story and franchise for Blizzard Entertainment, and Terran Gregory, the in-game cinematic project director, on the recent rise of female characters in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
This rise in female characters was not done on purpose. It happened organically as the story progressed and wasn't a marketing angle.<br />
Unfair would not be a word used to describe the fact that two powerful male characters are going to oppose Sylvanas as she is clearly a force to be reckoned with.<br />
Realizing that all three Warbringers are woman was hindsight, it wasn't a goal.<br />
The story up to Warlords of Draenor was very much Orc vs Human. Now that this has died down, it has paved the way for new characters and stories to develop.<br />
The team realized that a lot of the prominent characters in the story being told right now are female, but only saw it as an observation and not something that they need to change as they just want to tell these great stories.<br />
The fact that all three Warbringers have complex, deep stories makes them work so well.<br />
Terran was excited to work with Yrel in cutscenes during Warlords of Draenor because she was pitched as being a Draenei Joan of Arc.<br />
The team hopes fans notice that some of the recent cinematics have been more quiet and character driven over huge action scenes.<br />
The team doesn't necessarily believe that they have to balance the story about how many main characters are of each gender. They just want to tell interesting stories that players care about.<br />
Not all characters resemble their motion capture counterparts, but if it works (such as with Anduin) they will utilize it.<br />
While they did use some motion capture design, it was still mostly referential. The performances that we see from Saurfang or Sylvanas or Anduin are still largely hand keyed and driven by our animation artists.<br />
The team utilized a lot of real-time cutscenes in BfA and hope to develop them more in the future.<br />
When a cinematic fires in-game, by and large their function is to match the game’s art style.<br />
There are no plans for a fully three dimensional cutscene yet, but the team would be excited to try one!<br />
Legendary Pictures still has involvement in licensing rights for the stereoscopic view of Stormwind that they used to promote the movie.<br />
<br />

Give me a break, dude. Jaina, Sylvannas, Azshara, Tyrande are all about as OG as it gets in Warcraft.

<br />
Yeah they've always been around but now they've doubled down and added even more (Princess Talanji for example). You also have Christie Golden basically leading the story writing and we all know she wants to push the narrative. To have all of them at the same time, while Golden, while she goes on her Burning Crusade with her feminine hero Manduin is highly on the nose.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact they have asked Golden to &quot;repair&quot; the WC3 dialogue is going to make it even worse. Expect her to shit on the story even more</div></div><hr />

Honestly, if they were to do that, they should just add it to Warcraft 3 reforged (and maybe even rename the game Warcraft Reforged) and turn it into a paid dlc or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mythic+ feature have a weekly rotating mods that buff the dungeon in various ways. <br />
In the picture we see, Fortified, teeming and explosive. <br />
Fortified means trashmobs have more hp and more dmg. <br />
Teeming means the packsize of some packs in the dungeon is increased aswell as you need to clear more trash to complete the dungeon.<br />
Explosive means that each mob have the ability to summon an orb that will explode and dmg your entire group unless destroyed. <br />
<br />
All those 3 affixes combined will increase the time it takes to clear that dungeon by quite a bit. And that dungeon is already pretty heavy on trash with some really strong trashmobs so making the timer in that dungeon will be tough.</div></div><hr />

It was more in the line of. It must be a Monday joke. He wakes up , sees that he got a downgrade AND the hardest key to do. And went back to sleep. Stop with this nothing to do agenda.

Vanilla all the lore chars just stood around maybe gave 1 quest. BC they introduced khadgar back and what did he do? Stood next to a'dal. My opinion the open story of these two was better for releveling also feel less railroaded down the same story you have seen already. Instead of following a linear story to level A to B to C you could do C then A skip B cause it doesn't interest you. A few long quest chains is nice and feel better when they are used sparingly to me not the entire zone being one long quest chain and following one npcs story through the zone makes it this huge questchain. Then again vanilla and bc were not the best at telling stories ingame and more linear quests are better but it kills the world for me. I used to look up lore of places and people I had been searching through things like wowwiki and enjoying it. Now its shoved down my throat whether I like it or not.</div></div><hr />

They said they were going to change the appearances of certain locations, and the Culling of Stratholme trailer implied they were going to rerecord lines with the voice actors from WoW. As far as I'm aware, they did not mention anything about an increased focus on &quot;secondary characters&quot; or having Golden &quot;clean up&quot; the dialogue. <br />
<br />
Having different voice actors was bad enough. I really don't want anyone currently involved with the writing in WoW to go anywhere near the original story and/or dialogue of WarCraft III.</div></div><hr />

You also have Christie Golden basically leading the story writing and we all know she wants to push the narrative. To have all of them at the same time, while Golden, while she goes on her Burning Crusade with her feminine hero Manduin is highly on the nose.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact they have asked Golden to &quot;repair&quot; the WC3 dialogue is going to make it even worse. Expect her to shit on the story even more<br />
<br />
&quot;THEY ADDED A FEMALE CHARECTER, THIS IS FEMALE BIAS!!!&quot;<br />

Yes we so happen to have an expansion with a few female leads...<br />
but how many MANY expansions have we had where its literally entirely male leads, can we not have atleast some females for once?<br />

The motivation behind the female leads? what do you mean<br />
jaina is finally getting revenge on the horde, and helping her people<br />
talanji is a princess who is helping her people<br />
tyrande is getting revenge on the horde and recapturing darkshore<br />
<br />
what is there not to understand?<br />
other then sylvanas, which seems odd, but we will have to wait till the full story fufills as to see why.</div></div><hr />

They're great characters, Jaina has always been my favourite since the old WC days so more story for her is fine by me. <br />
<br />
As for hating on the writing for WoW, I actually don't have a problem with it. The story in BfA so far has been about the only aspect of the content that I've actually felt was strong. Warfronts, M+, islands, WQ, Azerite gear all suck atm but leveling and going through the zones and stories was really fun. Yeah there are plot holes and bits that don't make complete sense but that's what happens when you have so many people working on a project this large. Hell even a lot of Tolkiens work is full of holes and he's considered the grand master of fantasy writing.<br />
<br />
Honestly until its out I'm going to stay excited about it. If it comes out and turns out to be shit then yeah I'll join in the complaining but complaining about it before anyones even played it is pretty stupid. And if your reason for hating it or BfA is because they want to flesh out strong female characters, then holy shit get over it.</div></div><hr />

It's because Christie Golden is a shit-level writer and has been the worst thing to happen to WoW since patch 6.0. Metzen was actually a good creative director who led WoW through many glorious moments. Funny how as soon as Golden signs on, we have the expansion with the WORST FUCKING STORY IN WARCRAFT HISTORY.

I think that Sylvanas 1v1'ing Malfurion ez is a new thing though, that's not something that was built for years<br />
<br />
And I think nobody here is really complaining about Jaina, Sylvanas, Azshara or Tyrande. But introducing Rastakhan for the sole purpose of pitifully getting rid of him to promote his pristine flawless Talanji, this is shoehorned.</div></div><hr />

I think the main problem is that she is a neo marxist feminist, or radical feminist, whatever you want to call it. Things like her talking on twitter, about how Anduin and Thrall are an example of &quot;non toxic masculinity&quot;, or the ridiculous line in the Before the Storm novel where she wrote Sylvanas thinking something like &quot;She knew that she was the first female warchief, and she was proud of it&quot;...because you know...the woman that was the commander of the high elf army for thousands of years, now the leader of an entire race, would obviously care about positions of power not being occupied by females...right? we all know about the rampant misogyny in Warcraft, right?...Jesus Christ...<br />
<br />
The worst thing for me is that I love how Christie Golden writes, her dialogs are great, when you read her works you feel like you are reading two friends talking, if that makes sense, her dialogs are really natural, but she fucked it up with her ideology, she is bringing her poisonous radical ideology to Warcraft, and now the doors are open, she already tainted the story, so from now on, people will be skeptic about her in everything she touches. It's sad, but she was the one that started this whole mess, and I doubt that it will change any time soon, I still have hope tho.</div></div><hr />

well, up until the end of cata, there wen't really any strong characters period. There were faction leaders, but those were mostly there to be killed during city raids. In MoP, I didn't really play horde, but iirc it was mostly thrall and garrosh (and we all know how those two ended up), while alliance got 2 prominent female characters (wink wink). In WoD, as Alliance you end up with a female tagalong that you got to boost to become the leader of her people. On Horde side I can't recall anything similar. Both Alliance females basically skipped legion, while horde had their only female leader appointed as warchief. So yeah, if you count faction leaders as leads, sure, but ever since wow became story driven, it's been mostly female, or pretty much female at most.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of who is doing it, I don't feel any changes are needed for the dialogue, story, or characters, period. They didn't change any of that for the StarCraft remaster, why is it necessary for WarCraft III?<br />
<br />
Also, you seem to have missed, or don't remember, the jokes about Metzen's &quot;green Jesus&quot;. People have been complaining about WoW's story, myself included, long before Golden was as involved as she is currently.</div></div><hr />

I agree, out of all of the characters of the WoD xpac, she felt the most forced.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Christie Golden, I think that her writing/writing style is done well in most cases. However, I believe the feminist ideology she forces into the game is a hindrance more than anything. <br />
<br />
Isn't the way to develop a character well accomplished by &quot;showing&quot; and not &quot;telling&quot; the reader/player?<br />
<br />
Pushing a character through a slog of events quickly, no matter how actually plausible, is only another way of &quot;telling&quot; the reader about a character instead of &quot;showing&quot;.<br />
<br />
None of the writers are immune to this, but let's step up the game.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, they burned that bridge all the way back in Wrath of the Lich King. <br />

Though, given how they have a weird tendency to randomly recast people anyway, even when the original voice actor is talking about how they are available on social media, there's a good chance we probably would have gotten someone different as Arthas regardless.</div></div><hr />

She keeps stuffing modern expressions into a fantasy dialogue and she has no idea about dialogue development. The characters she writes can go from an angry emotion to an agreeable emotion in one sentence.

Yrel was pretty garbage. I'm glad she isn't as prominent as the other three this time around -- big mistake that'd be. Even though they're the warbringers, if I'm being completely honest, this story's had way more involvement with troll princess, Rexxar, Bwonsamdi and Saurfang than our &quot;main&quot; three from the Horde end. It's not like everywhere I look it's some Vagina Mongolue-fueled estrogen-powered rant about how men are ruining Azeroth or something crazy, it's a pretty reasonable story so far. They still have time to mess it up, but their main three are almost too big to fail, unless of course they Green Jesus Jaina and Garrosh Sylvanas, then haha Blizzard does it again bravo.</div></div><hr />

That is false. I'd have to search through the right folder for source but no, they said diversity was their goal, it started in legion and they feel there is more they can do (of course, there is no ending when it comes to this belief system), for women in WoW.</div></div><hr />

I'm really hoping they do a full cinematic for Arthas vs. Illidan, since they always said they meant for it to be a cinematic, but ended up with that short cut scene instead, which left a lot of us thinking Illidan had died<br />
<br />
I believe someone mentioned at BlizzCon that it would be redone, since it was a cutscene. I don't have a source, it's just something I remember hearing.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The amount of people already claiming Christie will 'ruin' Warcraft III is hilarious. Y'all need to take a fucking chill pill for a moment. Keep in mind that old voice lines and old dialogue will still be an option for you to enable in-game if you want to keep the previous ones. You don't need to listen to the new voice lines or dialogue. They already said this.</div></div><hr />

Christie Golden does not work in a vacuum, nor does she have full control to make whatever changes she wants. The people who are working on this project are dedicated to keeping the game as good as it was, they have a serious love for the game and are genuinely passionate about it. That's not a flimsy barrier between her somehow trashing the game, it's important and a good thing.<br />

<br />
Though, given how they have a weird tendency to randomly recast people anyway, even when the original voice actor is talking about how they are available on social media, there's a good chance we probably would have gotten someone different as Arthas regardless.<br />
Things are more complicated than an actor being available or not.<br />
<br />
There are contracts and likely issues with royalties and pay. For example, Patrick Gross declined the offer to reprise Arthas because he and his agent wanted them to pay more. And I may be mixing things up, but I believe some of the WC3 voice actors were part of a company that had some sort of contractual conflicts preventing some or all of them from working on WoW.<br />
<br />
IIRC, Blizzard also only hires SAG-AFTRA members since like 2012 which would prevent them from hiring non-union actors.</div></div><hr />

Jaina, Sylvanas, and Azshara have all long been established and it makes sense that they're all prominently featured in this story. All of the other female characters feel pretty organic to the story. Tyrande's the leader of the night elves, Jaina's father and brother are dead so her mother rules, etc.<br />
<br />
Beyond them, there are plenty of male characters driving the narrative. Saurfang and Anduin, obviously, are getting a lot of the spotlight. Same for Rastakhan, Nathanos, Bwonsamdi, Zul, Genn, hell, even Gallywix and Mekkatorque.<br />
<br />
A lot of the plot in this expansion has felt arbitrary or contrived, but the people most involved in the conflict is a pretty natural progression of the story.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree with this.<br />
<br />
It's kind of weird that all four allied race leaders for horde are female, and three of four alliance allied race leaders are women. It's kind of an overwhelming amount. It does even out the overall representation of existing male and female leaders though, but with all of them coming into prominence at once it feels a bit unbalancing and a little sexist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of people on both sides wanted Grommash dead at the end of Warlords. His genocide of the Draeneis was not fueled by demon blood that time, it was entirely his will. It kind of sucked because it made the Orcs look inherently evil when the whole franchise had spent like 10 years trying to show that wasn't the case. <br />
<br />
On top of that he got away without any repercussions in the end, and Blizzard's flimsy excuse was that everyone on Draenor was tired of fighting so they just let it go. Him dying at the hand of Yrel was pretty much what he deserved (allegedly, at least... they didn't show him dying so they could decide to bring him back at some point). <br />
<br />
The biggest problem with Geya'rah is that she is nothing like her parents. She's impulsive, angry and vindictive. She's basically a female Garrosh, they could have made her Grommash's daughter at least instead of pretending she's the alternate universe Thrall. They didn't spend a lot of time creating her character, it seems, they went for all the Orc tropes they could think of and slapped a beloved character's name in the story hoping people would be happy with it.</div></div><hr />

Garona, the badass assassin that ingratiated herself with the Humans only to deal the decapitating blow that left them in disarray. Truly she is the OG female lore character!

They didn't specify that they are doing all 3, only that when considering them all they chose III because of demand. The word &quot;first&quot; was there to indicate that they are doing the third game in the series over the first two, but I removed it for clarification! Sorry!</div></div><hr />

jaina is finally getting revenge on the horde, and helping her people<br />
talanji is a princess who is helping her people<br />
tyrande is getting revenge on the horde and recapturing darkshore<br />
<br />
what is there not to understand?<br />
other then sylvanas, which seems odd, but we will have to wait till the full story fufills as to see why.<br />
<br />
No, the motivation of Blizzard story directors (See: Christie Golden)<br />
<br />
Talanji is a terribly shallow character plot device<br />
<br />
We also have acquired or brought into the forefront over the last two years: <br />
<br />
Mag'har orc leader Overlord Geyarah<br />
Dark Iron Dwarf leader Moira Thaurissan<br />
Nightborne leader Thalyssra <br />
Highmountain Tauren leader Mayla Highmountain<br />
Void Elves leader Alleria Windrunner<br />
Lightforged Draenei leader Captain Fareeya/Turalyon (this one is borderline)<br />
<br />
Then we have articles such as this talking about women in WoW and Golden talking about 'toxic masculinity' and then they come out and say it was natural and wasn't for marketing/virtue signalling purposes? give me a break.<br />
<br />
It's so overtly trying to push an agenda when before there was no issue at all. Hell I rolled an Undead as my first character in Vanilla because of how badass Sylvanas was in WC3 TFT. It's sad that todays storytelling has to be forced the way it is</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, so she got fucking killed, raised into a banshee... that is badass... mhm.<br />
wanna know what she did recently? saved the horde, beat down the legion, made a deal with a death god, burned down a fucking world tree, plagued an entire city beating down the alliance, killed hundreds of thousands, and raised a royal family member into servitude.</div></div><hr />

I think their point is more that an overwhelming percentage of new racial leaders introduced are women even when they have a make up a reason to get rid of an established male leader. The Zandalari being by far the most prominent. Dark Iron and Nightborn make sense as the Night Elven society has always been matriarchal and Moira is an established character. Void elves even though they are an ass pull of a race in the worst possible way also make sense since high elves would have been led by Veressa anyway. Those are fine Highmountain is fine no established leader. The issues come up mainly from Zandalari wifh a long established king of trolls being offed to make way for blizzard's new supergirl and getting rid of grom for the mag'har. There are also other plot discussions about how Sylvanas is acting contrary to her nature rather than as tuebcunning general we saw in wc3 in order to fulfil the &quot;strong women&quot; role which for most people is apparently act like a bloodthirsty lunatic. However she has been doing that for a while it isn't a recent change.<br />
<br />
So really the question is if you believe that blizzard offed two long established lore characters to push for more representation of women or not. It seems fairly likely tbh not saying it's bad or good just that it likely played a role.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. I realy liked the cinematics; and honestly I didn't reflect on them being all female until now, nor do I mind. I just wished they would be more than 'Disney-deep'.<br />
Still, given that everything in CA is beyond neck deep in identity politics, I'm very, very skeptical that any Californian, let alone an openly Lesbian CA born and bread woman, wouldn't have picked up on gender things from the first second of the first meeting.</div></div><hr />

Garbage logic. This is a fictional world. All characters, ALL, are created with intent. Even precious male characters are created with intent to represent something. The fact that you only have a problem with female characters being created this way shows your bias. It is that simple.<br />
<br />
All of you incels are crying over character creation in a fantasy world as if any of the characters are created with any different intents, for their audience to resonate and relate to them in order to make a profit. You guys really are mind numbingly stupid.</div></div><hr />

All dialogue is being rerecorded and utilizing the voice actors from WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, we're getting mad-mama Sylvanas instead of the cunning bastard? Seriously? <br />
Wc3 had one of the bestest voice-overs in the entire gaming history.<br />

The old Sylvanas voice is fucking awesome compared to the one we have right now.<br />
<br />
The original voice acting was perfect. God dammit last thing we need is the same Sylvanas voice acting we have now. I'm going to be expecting her to scream &quot;GREYMANES FORCES HOLD THIS WARDEN TOWER&quot; in the middle of a campaign<br />
<br />
Nothing is sacred anymore, this is why we can't have nice things</div></div><hr />

She ruins Arthas, Jaina, Medivh, Varian, Lothar and every role in her novels. I desired Warcraft III: Reforged so much, and now I just hope Christie Golden to go to hell!!!!</div></div><hr />

Christie Golden has come in to help clean up the dialogue<br />
<br />
LUL the agenda keep going foward</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately no... The echo in her voice, plus her attidute - being remorselessness, like a cold emotionless cunning bitch -&gt; that's perfect Sylvanas. <br />
<br />
Not some overreacting old-mama. She's speaking too slowly and is trying to accent every word whenever she speaks, it just sounds fake and doesn't fit her character at all(compared to the old one).<br />
<br />
And quite positive that people agree with me on this. If you think that's nostalgia, then you're wrong. That's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Second post in and BAM Kafkatrap.<br />

I have no problem with women being the main characters in the expansion, but I am not that stupid to believe this was unintentional.<br />
Pretty much dis. I've no problem with female leads, but I don't like how the media circus frames it.<br />

Glad to hear that.<br />
<br />
The original acting was amazing, only the sound recording isn't up to modern standards which is understandable.</div></div><hr />
