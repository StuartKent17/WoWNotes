Tanking - Health issues<br />
As I have said in similar topics, we are much more interested in solutions that let warriors and paladins feel like they are more useful on progression encounters than we are homogenizing classes even more than they already are. In other words, bumping warrior stamina and giving them more cooldowns just feels like the easy way out. If that's literally all we can do, then I am a little sad, because at some point the class distinctions are just going to come down to art. <br />
<br />
[...] Imagine that Malygos and the Obsidian Sanctum dragons breathed for physical damage. Or imagine that in Ulduar, there are no large bursts of magic damage. I am not saying that is the case, but if it were, would things feel more even? What if there are Ulduar bosses who hit very quickly but not for very large numbers?<br />
<br />
Again, the goal is still that if your guild picked a warrior for your MT that you can still complete even the hard mode encounters if your guild is good enough, and you won't constantly be wishing you had a druid or DK MT instead. However I have also acknowledged that some classes are just going to be easier on some encounters because of their mechanics, and only by complete homogenization will that be alleviated. The degree of difference is very important as is the diversity of the encounters. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15207814691-tanking-topics-3-health.html))<br />
<br />
Delay between patches<br />
I think that is totally fair. If we could get changes turned around faster, we would. We have been hotfixing more often, though we can't change everything via server patches like that. Patch 3.09 was an attempt to do a quick client patch with few changes that would require less QA testing. We hope to do more of them, perhaps even getting to very frequent and regular updates. However, WoW is a really large piece of software and any change affects a lot of people, both here working and customers. Balance problems may seem bad, but crashing servers or knocking people offline are far worse. As I have said, WoW is a supertanker, and those things don't turn on a dime. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15234887623-pvp-and-you--mistakes-revisited.html))<br />
<br />
Arena balance and loss %<br />
Arenas definitely put class balance under a microscope, though I also predict tougher fights in Ulduar may do the same for PvE.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of problems with Arenas that I would describe as round peg - square hole. In other words, some players are expecting something different out of Arena than they are getting. Part of this was because when Season 1 went live, it was a relatively easy way for players to get epics, especially compared to the raiding content at the time. Players assumed that they were &quot;supposed to&quot; participate in Arenas to gear-up. This wasn't necessarily the intention, but it was certainly a logical conclusion given the ease of getting the gear.<br />
<br />
Related, you are going to lose a lot of Arena matches. Players are used to beating every PvE encounter they go up against, often trivially in the case of soloing quests. If the matchmaking system is working properly, you are going to lose about as many matches as you win. I think many players profoundly underestimate the psychological effect of losing so often. They get frustrated, and they often blame us for their inability to beat other players, forgeting that they may be playing better players, or that they should lose 50% of their matches against players of equal skill.<br />
<br />
I am not saying class balance in Arena is perfectly balanced -- it's not. But I am saying that even if and when we achieve perfect balance (should such a thing even be possible), you are still going to lose a lot of matches. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15234887831-what-good-has-arena-brought-to-the-game.html))<br />
<br />
Quick leveling and &quot;lack&quot; of content<br />
Even as quick as leveling has become, it is still a commitment to get a character to max level and fully geared. We feel like we owe it to players who make that commitment to be competitive without bad numbers alone holding them back (within reason of course). If your class is gimped, your only choice is to reroll. While that may be a good cure for boredom, it's also a pretty heavy price for us to ask you to pay.<br />
<br />
We aren't constantly tweaking the numbers just to keep you on your toes. Believe me, if we ever thought we had truly nailed a class, we would call it done and stop messing with buffs and nerfs (at least until the level cap is increased). But we are very critical of our own designs, so we like to keep tinkering with all the classes.<br />
<br />
Although WoW is a gigantic game, some players are just going to voraciously devour whatever content we can throw at them. There are certainly a lot of different ways to play the game that you can experiment with if you do get bored. I would suggest things like trade skills, achievements or completing all of the quests you might have skipped. Collect some offspec gear and try a different role (in PvP or PvE). Rerolling can also be a lot of fun. If you're just burned out, it's also not the worst thing in the world to try out some other games -- the past couple of years has been great for them. Just check back in with WoW every now and then. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15211006508-nerfs-and-buffs-101.html))<br />
<br />
PvP Gear rewards in battlegrounds<br />
There needs to be a way to get good gear through BGs. Unfortunately, we don't yet have a way to measure skill in BGs that is very reliable. Therefore, BG progression tends to feel pretty grindy and adding better rewards would probably only exacerbate that.<br />
<br />
It is definitely a goal to let players who like PvP but not Arenas still feel like they can advance (which includes improving their gear). It's just a big task that is requiring a lot of work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15234887831-what-good-has-arena-brought-to-the-game.html))<br />
<br />
Developement process and decision making<br />
1) The developers are still in charge of the game. There aren't actually any suits at Blizzard, and the highest level managers don't micromanage our design decisions. They offer their feedback and provide strategic-level (as in the future of Blizzard) direction, which is exactly what they should be doing. They are also all friends of mine -- Blizzard is a happy place to work. :) Developers at Blizzard are empowered. While you sure as heck need to be able to justify your decisions, you don't get overruled a lot.<br />
<br />
2) The WoW team develops as a team. Our team is probably larger than you suspect, but not many people on it post regularly. Many of them do read the forums however. Our design process is remarkably collaborative. None of the decisions made on WoW are mine alone. No decision made on WoW is the decision of one person. Everything about Blizzard is &quot;we.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15276979718-wheres-gc.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Death Knights PvP mechanics<br />
When we designed the DK class, we wanted to give them some PvP utility that felt different. Specifically, we didn't want to give them Mortal Strike, and we didn't want to give them lots of stuns, because both of those have been done to death.<br />
<br />
Removing hots we thought was an interesting mechanic. It is more situational than MS (since it affects different healers differently), and with Mind Freeze and Strangulate, we had given DKs a chance to cancel non-instant heals already. And yes, at the time, Resto druids were very dominant as PvP healers, so we didn't feel too bad about offering another way to counter them.<br />
<br />
During the beta, many of the participants were worried that DKs weren't going to be functional in PvP. Even with Death Grip there were many dire predictions of kitability, which is partially why DKs ended up with so many diverse snare mechanics (though they have fewer now than they did in beta).<br />
<br />
In the actual season though, it turned out the tanking-oriented survivability cooldowns ended up to be far more useful in PvP: Icebound Fortitude, Anti-Magic Shell, Bone Shield, etc. Of course Death Grip is still quite potent, and there are snares, interrupts, and even reasonable self-healing available. Simultaneously, many of the changes to both the Resto and Feral tree (Feral Charge for instance) as well as healing changes themselves made Resto duids less dominant than in previous seasons.<br />
<br />
As a reult, we're just not sure DKs need hot removal, and consequently, that would allow us to justify bringing up the damage of Plague Strike to where players weren't so loathe to hit the button, which might also make &quot;diseaseless rotations&quot; less attractive.

Lifebloom in PvP<br />
Our opinion is that Lifebloom might be a little inefficent in PvP even ignoring the DK dispels. However rolling Lifeblooms on 2-3 tanks is one of the most efficient heals in a PvE setting, almost brokenly so. So it isn't as simple as just lowering the mana cost.

Nerfing mana regeneration<br />
Our intention is not to nerf Ret mana generation. Our intention is to nerf Holy mana generation. In our tests, mana generation for Holy healers was quite variable depending on whether the paladin is taking damage or not. Since we don't want fights that do raid damage to always be easier than fights that don't do raid damage, Spiritual Attunement is something we are looking at.<br />
<br />
This is not the actual solution that we are going to do, but if it make you feel better, imagine that SA becomes a talent in both deep Protection and deep Retribution so that non-healing paladins are not mana starved.<br />
<br />
We're also not trying to cripple Holy paladins. But they are very dominant in Arenas at the moment (which is partially a function of what is happening to other classes), and they have very few mana problems even on challenging PvE content (like Ulduar). We do need to look at them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15207816060-why-are-they-nerfing-spiritual-attunement.html))<br />

No Abolish Poison for priests<br />
As a few players have suggested, we think the solution here is just to make sure that hunters and rogues aren't so good versus priests simply because of the lack of poison removal. We don't think that needs to be giving Abolish Poison or the like to priests. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15211806501-remove-poison-plea-for-priests.html))<br />

Earth and Fire Elemental<br />
The Earth Elemental isn't supposed to be a tank like paladins can be a tank. They are there as an oh snap button, such as in a situation where the tank goes down, or can't control all the adds or something. Understandably, it is going to be more useful in 5-player dungeons than in larger raids.<br />
<br />
The Fire Elemental hasn't kept up with the rest of the shaman arsenal, and probably needs a buff. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15276979821-fire-and-earth-elementals.html))<br />

Windfury vs. Flametongue<br />
The designers are very aware of the WF vs. FT discussion. We are still talking about the issue and exploring different ways we can shift numbers back and forth. This is something I very much want to discuss with my team some more and it would be irresponsible for me to comment on our direction or solutions until that time.

Arms tree in Patch 3.1<br />
Right now, we are working a lot on the Arms tree for 3.1, so suggestions and feedback on that play style are timely and useful. While Arms dps is too low at the moment, we are more interested in adjustments to signature abilities (say Mortal Strike, Overpower, Sudden Death, Taste for Blood and things like that) than we are just inflating passive damage, especially passive white damage.

If you won't give us a way to do something about poisons then something needs to be done with how a rogue is able to put up THREE poisons on a target in a matter of 2-3 seconds. That is pretty BS them being able to cripple us, give us 50% healing reduction AND increase our casting time. Or even better, one rogue being able to do that to a full group of players with FOK.<br />
<br />
Honestly I would rather see you guys give us a way to spec into removing poisons like how you gave shaman the best pvp &amp; pve dispell in game (sorry pallies but you have to worry about UA from a lock so its not as good as a dispell that removes only stuff that has no way of dealing dmg/silencing you when you remove it).</div></div><hr />

You should read the old DLCs, they're awesome. Just the newer they get, they tend to become less and less funny, with some exceptions in between. Right now, this one's not so good, I agree.<br />

Last time i did arena vs a DK/Holy paladin. My combo was Disc Priest/Surv Hunter. After i killed the DK, both me and my priest started buring down the pala. But he kept running around pillars and gaining mana like crazy! He was truly unoomable, and ended up running around pillar for like 10 minutes before i could finally kill him.<br />
<br />
So yea, in PVP paladins have to much mana regen. In PVE however you'll get mana regen from other ppl now that theyve spread the mana regen on other classes, and nerfed that of a single pala a bit. Its not a nerf to PVE really, only nerf to PVP and non raid PVE. But why should a pala be able to do everything, (tank,heal,dps) and above that have immunity, dispells, imba mana, plate, freedom, bop, low mana consuming abilities, instant full HP etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would hardly describe it as the best pvp &amp; pve dispel. Pve-wise, magic vs curse is just a developer decision on which classes bear the brunt of dispelling that particular fight - but pvp-wise, dispelling curses stops Curse of Tongues from warlocks and Hex from other shaman. In return for worrying about UA from a lock, pallies also get the benefit of removing a wide range of snares and poly; magic is a much more powerful category to dispel in pvp.</div></div><hr />

If you won't give us a way to do something about poisons then something needs to be done with how a rogue is able to put up THREE poisons on a target in a matter of 2-3 seconds. That is pretty BS them being able to cripple us, give us 50% healing reduction AND increase our casting time. Or even better, one rogue being able to do that to a full group of players with FOK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz really needs to work on dispells and stacking debuffs in pvp. Stacking debuff + dispell resistance = effectively undispellable unless you spend a gajillion GCDs on it, which would in the end be better spent on healing/cc. So then... why not remove the stacks and just mark as dispellable? ::)</div></div><hr />

It may be hard to believe but I'd say at least 75% of the game doesn't give a damn about just another mount. Shocking I know. Doing the hardest fight in the game just for a stupid mount doesn't interest everyone. You sound like Blizzard thinking that every kid should want every toy and play till they get it.

And what you scrub raiders fail to realize is that most of the achievements involved in getting (Heroic) Glory of the Raider would have been the default fight in Vanilla or TBC. Malygos enrage timer? Would have been 6 minutes. Sartharion? Would have always pulled with his 3 drakes. (Bear with me with the Naxx encounter analogies, I know these aren't how the fights operated in Vanilla I'm just trying to make a point). A single crossed polarity for Thaddius would have been a wipe. All 4 Horseman would have to go down at the same time. Yadda yadda yadda. What, now because it's an achievement you don't want to do what would have been the real encounter previously? Then you're raiding for the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
Granted, many of the achieves are retarded. Having to take less people, having to make a sandwich instead of paying attention (volcano blows and denyin the scion, I'm looking at you), and even the no one dies (lol random number generator) achievements are just lazy design. Hopefully the Ulduar Raiding meta achieves will pretty much consist solely of the 11 Hard-Modes and defeating the optional Hard-mode only encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yeh, be careful how you define &quot;hard mode&quot; though. Malygos in 6 minutes is easier mode for healers. So is Patchwerk in 3 minutes. So is killing Grand Widow without dispelling the frenzy. So is spider wing in 30 minutes. None of this is &quot;hard mode&quot;. It's a speed run. If you want to call a speed run progression go ahead, but IMHO real progression is killing new bosses. Even &quot;they all go down together&quot; felt easy, in fact no-one died on our kill which was better than normal; we usually have 2 or 3 die at the back to the chain-holy-bolt-c'thun-beam thing.<br />
Low-manning the instance and having no-one die isn't &quot;hard mode&quot; either. It's normal mode just with less people, and/or less screw-ups.<br />
<br />
The only hard mode at the moment is 3 Drake Sarth. (sarth 2D being another &quot;easier mode&quot;) So, more like this please, but we'll have to wait and see if the new hard modes are really harder.</div></div><hr />

And regardless of how the drakes are spun, it's still not new content. It's still 4H, just done slightly differently. It's still Loathb, just longer. Etc... The only fight that is significantly different is Sarth3D, but still same rules apply, only better rewards.<br />

You would have always had to fight Sarth with his 3 drakes before WotLK. Malygos would have had a 6 minute enrage before WotLK. Just because it happens to be an achievement doesn't mean it's not progression. 6 minute Maly is a significant DPS check, just like Patchwerk was in Vanilla Naxx.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It would only be a personal progression for you, not for the game.<br />
<br />
Do you need to beat Malygos in 6 minutes to keep going on the game? No.<br />
<br />
Do you need to beat Sartharion and his 3 Drakes to keep going on the game? No.<br />
<br />
In a easier way to understand:<br />
<br />
Diablo 2 = Content<br />
Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction xpac = Content<br />
Playing Diablo 2 in harder dificult mode (that I can't remember the name anymore) = Playing the same old content.<br />
<br />
Using it on WoW.<br />
<br />
WoW = Content<br />
WoW new instances/raid patches = Content<br />
WoW TBC = Content<br />
TBC new instances/raid patches = Content<br />
WotLK = Content (not taking into account Naxx here)<br />
WotLK new instances/raid patches = Content<br />
<br />
Fix patches? Not content.<br />
Achievements? Not content.<br />
<br />
So, in WotLK so far, very very very poor content. It's not because you have a 3D title and another player doesn't have, that he didn't see the same content as you. He didn't see the exactly the same encounter mechanic as you, but both didn't see anything new regarding the game content. You just ended up leaving the place with &quot;a soon to be normal lvl&quot; drop, someone with a recolored version of a mount and a new title (or not).<br />
<br />
And all that attached to the progression notion. Altough you don't exactly need to go naxx to gear and be ready to face malygos/sartharion, you do need some of that gear. And it ends in Sartharion. You don't go get better gear to face Sarth 3D, it's the same gear you've got on him and naxx/maly, you progression ends the moment you kill Sartharion, be it with 0, 1, 2 or 3 drakes. TBC was far easier (with atunments everywhere to show it better) to show with Kara/Grulls/Mag &gt; ZA/TK/SSC &gt; BT/Hyjal &gt; SWP.<br />
<br />
To sum up, Ulduar is your content/progression after killing Sartharion, not Sartharion 3D or any other achievements.</div></div><hr />

While what you say may be true, things may or may not have been harder in BC and Vanilla, it doesn't matter. The fact remains that Malygos (achievement or not) is still just Malygos.</div></div><hr />

There needs to be a way to get good gear through BGs. Unfortunately, we don't yet have a way to measure skill in BGs that is very reliable. Therefore, BG progression tends to feel pretty grindy and adding better rewards would probably only exacerbate that.<br />
<br />
It is definitely a goal to let players who like PvP but not Arenas still feel like they can advance (which includes improving their gear). It's just a big task that is requiring a lot of work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15234887831-what-good-has-arena-brought-to-the-game.html))<br />

Malygos 6 minutes isn't much different from the normal mode, but it's still quite a lot harder, so a bit of a challenge for those complaining everything is too easy. If achievements don't motivate you, that's fine, but don't complain everything is too easy.

Isn't shaman level 80 base mana like 5000? 20% of that is reasonable every 8s isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Altough you don't exactly need to go naxx to gear and be ready to face malygos/sartharion, you do need some of that gear. And it ends in Sartharion. You don't go get better gear to face Sarth 3D, it's the same gear you've got on him and naxx/maly, you progression ends the moment you kill Sartharion, be it with 0, 1, 2 or 3 drakes. TBC was far easier (with atunments everywhere to show it better) to show with Kara/Grulls/Mag &gt; ZA/TK/SSC &gt; BT/Hyjal &gt; SWP.<br />
<br />
The majority of guilds that were able to walk into 25 man Naxx were the guilds (like mine) who were doing SWP and had full T6 still on at 80. That is where we replaced nearly all of our lvl 70 gear because there weren't any upgrades for us while we leveled up. A &quot;normal&quot; guild would be doing 10 man Naxx and struggling to clear it by the end of the week if they didn't buy BOE epics, craft their own epics, or farm heroics to get gear to help them better clear both 10 man and start doing the 25 man.<br />
<br />
And yes, there was the progression in BC that was pretty straight forward with attunements (correct spelling there btw) to show for it. There was also a similar line of progression for pre-BC with MC/ZG/Ony/AQ20 (when AQ was released) &gt; BWL &gt; AQ40 &gt; Naxx 40 man. What you fail to understand is that currently we are in the stage of vanilla WoW when there was nothing but MC &amp; in BC when there was no T6. People are in the starting spot for raiding. Right now you could possibly compare 2d to BWL in progression gear wise (above what the average person gets yet not necessarily WOWOMG gear). Get off your high horse and realize what current content is in relation to the vanilla WoW &amp; BC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don't give us who like arena some way to buy Neck, waist, bracer, boots... without playing any bg?<br />
<br />
Because when s1 came out you could buy necks, belts, bracers &amp; boots with arena points? Oh right you couldn't. Wasn't it starting in s3 or was it s4 that you could? Please refer to my above post for reference to the current stage of this xpac. And who cares if you have to go do a BG to get pvp gear? You had to do that before in BC too...and wouldn't you know you had to do EotS to get the marks to get them too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes this would be badass for sure, but they would also have to bring back to ability to form premades. Which is what honestly killed BGs in the first place. :( I mean seriously who the fuck wants to try to grind out anything with a bunch of random dipshits, only alternative is to sit in queue for eternity waiting an another premade to join queue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed. Ulduar should provide hardcore raiders with the ability to test their skills; just forego the easy modes and start off by tackling the Flame Guardian with all four towers standing.<br />
<br />
You might have had an argument with the starting content in WotLK, but now you have plenty of time to prepare to do Ulduar hard-mode only. I wish you luck.</div></div><hr />

Since when, were they not OP, yes it's never. I think it quite clear that Death Knight's are balanced like they are right now. Yeah, sure they makes them a realy nice summary DPS in Raid when they have DW but don't come and say that you do not need it. then all fucking whining about only little kids play DKs and No skill is needed, to you I say STFU, when isnt it needed for skills to tank in Naxx 25 men as a Blood spec DK? Say what you want but you know that I am right.<br />
<br />
Then to hold on to whine all the time that dks can do this and that WTF, talk about not being able to play their class. Death Knights will always be a class that is good for all type of game playing, DPs, Tank and PVP. As a fine closing wtf are they removing Shadow of death, please do not say that you small kids have whined and cryed to mommy that Death Knights have 2 lives, Or yes in Unhloy spec O.O and how manny dk's seen in that spec right now, not so many no, or perhaps you damned Ally Gaming Cunts who have Whined to blizzard. Oh now it's to OP in PVP, well if so why not take away Paladins the bubbel, oh wait. They can't do that cuse then Paladins are worthless pieces of junk. <br />
<br />
<br />
AND TO ALL U WHO ARE PLAYING A ALLY GO FUCK YOUR SELF WHIT ARMAGEDON AND STFU WORTHLESS PIECES OF SHIT</div></div><hr />
