Nihilum and SK-Gaming to merge into a new guild<br />
It looks like most of the members from Nihilum and SK-Gaming (ex Curse) decided to merge into a single guild ... more info on November 25th. <br />
<br />
From http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/ (http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/)<br />
<br />
We are proud to announce the forming of a new force in World of Warcraft. Many of you will remember the guilds Nihilum and SK Gaming(Curse) from the past years, we have now decided to combine our strengths to create the number one team for Wrath of the Lich King and beyond. We have spent a considerable amount of time forging the greatest roster ever assembled in this game and we are now ready to take on anything that is released. To support this roster we have finally found an appropriately motivated team to back us and help us reach our full potential. Together we aim to deliver a much more professional and WoW tailored experience to the community than anything else that has been done in the past.<br />
<br />
At this point we are just offering a taste of what's to come. As the name suggests we are going to be doing our full launch on the 25th of November under a new brand but we wanted to let the community know that we are combining our efforts prior to this launch. So what is coming on the 25th? We are going to launch a new portal that's built around the guild with the goal of being one of the best World of Warcraft community sites. So watch this space until the 25th. You will find us leveling up on Magtheridon and striving for world firsts in the new wave of content.<br />

Well, i use that term loosely... But together they'll manage to get a lot of world firsts.<br />
<br />
Good for sponsor moneys.<br />
They're taking the best of 2 guilds and making 1 group at least. Not sure what'll happen to the remaining members that were &quot;less good&quot;. I'd guess there'll be a second raid group, or eventually a split off from those remaining players.<br />
<br />
ps: You could add that some of the Tier 7 pieces are also available from the badge vendor.</div></div><hr />

IIRC It's two tokens per boss.</div></div><hr />

Do you think they will use Magtheridon or Vek'nilash as their new home?</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they are having fun. I think it's awesome that they can do what they do. However, I just think it's kinda silly to put out &quot;press releases&quot; and things of that nature. A website counting down? Oh boy, I can't wait now! My life (in WoW) is totally going to change now that those guilds are together. It's just a bit self-righteous, don't you think?<br />
<br />
I have only one issue with the new gear. There are a lot of 1.8 speed daggers coming. It's been tested and proven that dps for an assassination rogue is much higher with faster daggers, due to the poison procs. Very few people do combat daggers so does this mean everyone will be dumping these daggers for easier to obtain, faster daggers from lesser instances? That has the potential to be a big issue (remember the Barman Shanker pre-normalization?)</div></div><hr />

They are just trying to sound professional because they want to make some money out of this. who can blame them for that?<br />
They probably want their new website to be up there with mmochampion, worldofraids, EJ etc as a resource/forum. not just another guild site</div></div><hr />

somewhat true! Not the new super-guild nor anyone else can top them...<br />

It is actually the case that you have to raid the Obsidian Sanctum to get your T7 Gloves.<br />
<br />
<br />

Be thankful it's like that and not like T4, which was even more spread out. Running one extra raid isn't a big deal at all to get a full set.</div></div><hr />

Don't think that anyone care's if 2 guild's merge in one. They should try to enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm glad they are having fun. I think it's awesome that they can do what they do. However, I just think it's kinda silly to put out &quot;press releases&quot; and things of that nature. A website counting down? Oh boy, I can't wait now! My life (in WoW) is totally going to change now that those guilds are together. It's just a bit self-righteous, don't you think?<br />
<br />
<br />
You know they make their living off of WoW, right? And they got shown up by the mass of &quot;good&quot; guilds clearing content almost as fast as they did in Sunwell, so they both needed a boost to put them head and shoulders above the rest again.<br />
<br />
Otherwise why would they stay sponsored?</div></div><hr />

I can buy the fan following thing, people are pretty lame. However, you are sorely mistaken if you think I came to a site about WoW and created an account to post about someone else's guild though. I have no idea how you can compare people signing up on this site for news and discussion on our game to signing up to talk about a bunch of guys I'll never play with or talk to. Regardless of them existing, I'd be here getting my news.</div></div><hr />

chamber is more like ony, you zone in and the boss is infront of you,no key<br />
some trash around ,and 3 mini bosses ,each one you choose to leave up makes boss stronger/gain an ability and in exchange you receive more loot<br />
<br />
the glove token isnt related to drakes,so with all the drakes down hes pretty weak<br />
<br />
also you can buy the 10man glove token(or chest)from badge vendor for 10man or heroic badges<br />
25man badges get ya legs or shoulders 25man versions<br />

<br />
To me, from reading it, it more sounds like they had a massive retirement and they needed to merge to stay strong.<br />
<br />
And instead of going through the recruitment process both decided they would merge. Which says to me, they most likely were invited to beta, didn't like what they saw, and a lot left because it wasn't, either good, fun, or challenging.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, before the changes and the nerfs to raiding content, if you've been in SWP at all, you know how challenging it was, and even if you've finished since, you also know fights like KJ would be insane before the nerfs, and they did it first.<br />
<br />
It's gonna be an interesting expansion.</div></div><hr />

The playerbase may be going up, but the number of quality players is going down due to recent actions by Blizzard.

Thank you I already know all the racials as well as class skills and talents. If you wipe on 2%, it means you know tactic and you know how to beat that boss, also it means you can reproduce tactic or improve it a bit to beat the boss. IIRC Nihilum had some 1% wipes before they downed twins. Still they did it as World 1st. And I dont believe that they did it cause of racials or that racials had serious impact on this.</div></div><hr />
