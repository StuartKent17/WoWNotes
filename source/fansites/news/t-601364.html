<meta name="description" content="New SSC / Karazhan / Gruul's Lair skins 
 
New honor belt/boots/bracers skins are in the game files, I was too lazy to get them, but it seems they'll be upgraded too (which explains why they're missing from the vendors for the moment) 
 
I couldn't get the Paladin shoulders, don't know if they're missing (possible) or if I was too stupid (even more possible) 
 
For any other information, check the previous news.

I think it has to do with pressure from the Armory and the need to update all items since the patch.</div></div><hr />
