Armor as DPS specs<br />
What's up with the armor scaling for dps specs? My shaman who should normally have 30-40% phys reduction from armor, apparently has only 10% in BfA right now.<br />
That looks like a tooltip bug in the &quot;against current enemy&quot; line--it appears to be showing your mitigation against a 120 in all the cases you're seeing here. You should indeed expect to see a number slightly higher than than the number in the first line, when targeting a -1 level enemy. The 25% you're seeing in the first line is in the right ballpark for a mail-wearer against a par enemy (subject to the exact items you have on, etc.).<br />
<br />
As far as taking a lot of damage while questing, that could be either:<br />
1) It's not just a tooltip bug and perhaps you are actually taking damage as though the attacker was 120. We'll have to look into that.<br />
2) We're all used to questing in endgame gear on live, so it's a big shift to go back to questing in quest gear, where the enemies are a better match for you. Fighting 3 standard outdoor mobs at once is the sort of thing that should have a chance of killing you.

Brewmaster - Stagger<br />
I agree with this - it should be clear what the default stagger percentage is. This should be added to the Character Pane.<br />
No promises yet, but the character sheet is a possible solution we might try here. Because Stagger now uses a more complex calculation akin to armor, it's difficult to present it in a tooltip. For the moment, the salient points are:<br />
<br />
1) You want Agility to drive the value of Stagger, similarly to how all tanks now want Strength/Agility to make sure their armor/AM keeps up with content they're tanking.<br />
<br />
2) In current alpha, with par gear against the content you're fighting, Stagger amounts are similar to what they'd been before the change (40% baseline, 70% when you have Ironskin Brew up, etc.).

<br />
Soothing Mist<br />
1) Just to say it, sorry about the confusion where we said we were going fix a bug with mobile Soothing Mist and then wound up removing it this build. We made the latter decision a few days later. Briefly--with Soothing Mist changing so much between Legion and BFA, the impact of mobile Soothing would have gone from &quot;a small filler heal can be cast while moving&quot; to &quot;all 5 of your core heals can now be cast while moving.&quot; The latter is something we avoid on healers.<br />
<br />
2) Any details on ReM overwriting itself would be good. It should not be trying to jump unless there is an injured target that doesn't already have your Renewing Mist on them.

Before the Storm Novel Description Updated<br />
Krainz noticed (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8dqrvd/prediction_this_faction_war_will_be_concluded/) that Christie Golden's upcoming novel Before the Storm (http://amzn.to/2ywUb30) has an updated description. You can see the previous description here (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7156-Before-the-Storm-Delayed-Developer-Interviews-Blue-Tweets-DLC-607).<br />
Azeroth is dying.<br />
<br />
The Horde and the Alliance defeated the demonic Burning Legion, but a dire catastrophe is unfolding deep below the surface of the world. There is a mortal wound in the heart of Azeroth, struck by the sword of the fallen titan Sargeras in a final act of cruelty.<br />
<br />
For Anduin Wrynn, king of Stormwind, and Sylvanas Windrunner, warchief of the Horde and queen of the Forsaken, there is little time to rebuild what remains and even less to mourn what was lost. Azeroth’s devastating wound has revealed a mysterious material known as Azerite. In the right hands, this strange golden substance is capable of incredible feats of creation; in the wrong ones, it could bring forth unthinkable destruction.<br />
<br />
As Alliance and Horde forces race to uncover the secrets of Azerite and heal the wounded world, Anduin enacts a desperate plan aimed at forging a lasting peace between the factions. Azerite jeopardizes the balance of power, and so Anduin must gain the trust of Sylvanas. But, as ever, the Dark Lady has her own machinations.<br />
<br />
For peace to be possible, generations of bloodshed and hatred must be brought to and end. But there are truths that neither side is willing to accept and ambitions they are loath to relinquish. As Alliance and Horde alike grasp for the Azerite’s power, their simmering conflict threatens to reignite all-out war—a war that would spell doom for Azeroth.<br />

<br />
but the problem a lot of us have. Its a story that's already been told in great detail even down to the Genocide.<br />
we spent an entire expansion taking down a psycho horde leader. Having an Alliance leader do the same thing would be unthinkable.<br />
Only time will tell. but right at this moment I have the same feeling I did about WOD and we all know how that turned out.<br />
<br />
I dont like playing the Alliance side. but if they really are wanting horde players to be the &quot;nasty&quot; ones now <br />
Its going to push people away, allowing a 3rd faction would actually make more sense at this moment in the Games Journey.<br />
to give you a prime example of lazy writing. the broken shore Scenario both leaders were basically flirting and showing huge respect<br />
then right at the end.. its like all that didn't happen. <br />
<br />
she supposed to have no feelings so why portray the story line in that fashion. It just comes across its easier to make all bad things<br />
horde related and its getting really depressing now</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the way I see it, we don't KNOW if Sylvanas is being set up as another Garrosh psycho raid boss or whatever. We don't, people are assuming based on precedent that it'll happen.<br />
<br />
It's always been a constant Horde story arch that they're allied by convenience, because on their own the Alliance will wipe them out. They don't all necessarily like eachother, in fact you can tell through multiple datamined dialogue that most of the Horde downright dislike and are bloody racist towards members of their own faction. Even in live, post-Legion cinematic shows nobody likes Goblins. Nobody. It isn't a Gallywix issue, Saurfang refers to them all as rats, Baine jokes they're edible looking, Sylvanas rolls her eyes and huffs when Gallywix approaches her. <br />
Then it's no secret since Vanilla none of the Horde leaders trust the Forsaken. Vol'jin didn't either, he elected her on behalf of his unshakeable religious belief in the Loa telling him to elect her. <br />
Then after Garrosh, Orcs are still in a shaky and shameful place among the other races. Though there isn't much to go on in-game, with much of it covered in War Crimes.<br />
<br />
So it makes sense that expansion after expansion we deal with Horde never coming to terms with eachother, and Sylvanas' story direction is just another example.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm of the opinion Alliance atrocities just haven't been datamined yet, Blizzard said themselves the entire expansion will leave you feeling your faction is in the right. I doubt they'd so blatantly tell Horde players &quot;yep, y'all are assholes, and the bad guys always lose in Warcraft guys, sorry&quot;. The Alliance will do SOMETHING, I guarantee it. Hopefully it's not humans doing everything, would love to see tension flaring up in the Alliance from something their new allies do to create a sense of rift in the faction that leads up to a civil war storyline in a later expansion.<br />
<br />
Maybe a good storyline that can come out of this is a Horde race already teetering on edge in the Horde like Goblins, Trolls or Blood Elves decide to leave, get freakin' slaughtered by the Alliance despite them just wanting to cut ties with the Horde and do their own thing, making the Alliance look like total assholes.</div></div><hr />

Well, it is effectively the coagulated blood of a titan. We've seen the other titans do both destructive acts and acts of creation. It just so happens that the people who have control over Azerite kind of want to use it to kill each other.<br />

Anduin seems to have some good intentions, but he still yields far too much the Genn. This war is the continuation between the Genn and Sylvanas conflict that has been boiling since Cata.</div></div><hr />

He's dead. They worded the news poorly.</div></div><hr />

There is just nothing appealing with this expansion for me so far. It all looks so generic and everything about the story feels so forced, lame and somewhat pointless.<br />
<br />
Looking that this Teldrassil video doesn't look all that promising. They seem to have re-used the original Teldrassil graphics so it looks really poor and the entire scenario looks and feels so lacklustre. I know its Alpha so hopefully it will improve a bunch but compared to the past expansions everything just seem to lack polish and when you combine that with what feels like uninspired content I just can't get hyped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand these people. 99% of the cases Blizzard doesn't improve anything on alpha stuff or they just scrap it. Probably because they have no money to hire more people to work on things but you know these are hard days for the smallest indie company on the world.</div></div><hr />

Story seems reasonable to test out the burning event and lordaeron one and thats all. I quit when catadisaster was released, played a month of pandamon and haven't played since then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch. Well I guess that solves the problem of whether or not I'll be playing a monk this expansion.</div></div><hr />
