Blood Legion released a video of their Lich King kill in 10-man. Keep in mind that this is the 10-man normal mode version, I suggest that you wait for a video of the 25-man in heroic mode to see how hard/impressive the encounter can be.  
 
Important - Players are randomly sent to the Frostmourne room during the encounter, sadly the player frapsing the fight wasn't teleported this time. You will have to wait another video to see this part of the fight." />

So you don't wipe to the huge amount of frost damage you will probably take if you stand inside his pulsing frosty aura.</div></div><hr />

I've only watched some of it but looked to me like he was using AM whenever Abarr procced regardless of stack size. Presumably because he needed to be more mana efficient.</div></div><hr />

Video though was normal killshot video but i would have muted vent when my guildmates where talking over the lore. <br />
<br />
We have not seen froustmourne but that doesnt save it, really. Its 10man normal but i highly doubt its gets more epic in there, just harder. ok 25man looks more epic than 10guys killing the mighty Lich King.</div></div><hr />

its a paladin, what do you expect? Guess we wasnt really frozen, just thinking if he buffs the raids or if he doesnt like all the paladins do, buffs are serious business for them. And after buffing the tank blessing of wisdom he decided to join the fight.</div></div><hr />

evidently you fail at playing a mage. He was going to 4stacks, then using missiles. Good job sir, I wouldn't tell someone how to play if they just got a world first. he's doing it right, your not. btw...im a mage too.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure a lot of the time he was usng 3 stack AB and the AM, even on the lich king.<br />

<br />
I mean the entire fight he's constantly fighting you on a melee basis? What the hell happened to being so awesome that he could just summon peeps like his undead buddies to kill you?<br />
<br />
In all honesty this fight should be INFESTED with lore, every 10 percent he should summon a miniboss like Resurrected Kel'thuzad and whatever not... and when you get those mini bosses down to 10% any of the heroes that want Arthas dead should come in and finish them and then join the rest of the fight....<br />
<br />
<br />
sorely disappointed, this will go down in history as a sad day in history.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) It's not 25 man. 25 man raids just are more &quot;epic&quot; in feeling than 10 mans.<br />
<br />
2) The music. Having music which emphasizes (bad spelling) the fight at hand can make or break a video in terms of &quot;epicness&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We just made a hotfix that disables the siege damage dealt by Saronite Bombs and the Global Thermal Sapper Charge. The siege damage of the bombs was causing the Frozen Throne platform to rebuild, which greatly decreases the difficulty of the encounter.&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
That's correct. Two attempts were spent on Sindragosa.<br />
<br />
We started working on the Lich King with 18 attempts remaining.<br />
<br />
We went in cold; this was the first 10man that we took into ICC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Explosion_Rex</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Decent video. Even being a 20 minute fight it looked like it was pretty easy. I suppose that we can hope that 25 heroic will be much more epic, but I imagine they will just up the boss stats like they always do and maybe add an extra attack.<br />
<br />
I realize that it was a first and they were all very excited (as I would be too) but I would've liked to hear what was said at the end of the fight, instead of vent.<br />
<br />
In my mind I imagined the LK fight as so much more epic. No Sylvanas, or Jaina, Saurfang, MOGRAINE, Mal'ganis? Tirion unfreezes 20 seconds before the end of the fight? That's just weak....<br />
<br />
After the cut scene of Arthas' death is there any further dialog with Tirion? Can you walk up to the thrown and talk to Bolvar or anything like that? Does anything happen when you get back to your capital city or anything?<br />
<br />
One would think something as huge as killing the Lich King would be worth some kind of event.</div></div><hr />

I will admit that Tirion just being there frozen so he could claim the credit was a little dissatisfying. Then again, people go on and on about how winning shouldn't be handed down.<br />
<br />
On the other hand we must all remember, everything that transpired in all of the Warcraft Series (and every game) was down to the player(s). I'm not saying you had a CHOICE in the matter, but you are the one who had to blow up all the alliance bases because Grom just HAD to provoke them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just hope though they don't make it so that every single lore figure that participates somehow gets incapacitated at the VERY beginning, it seems a little cheap.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also guys, remember the fight always seems boring if you're not the one participating. You could stare at a video of Archimonde losing to some guild, but actually being stuck in there dodging whatever he throws at you and coordinating with your guildies is different.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I mean the entire fight he's constantly fighting you on a melee basis? What the hell happened to being so awesome that he could just summon peeps like his undead buddies to kill you?<br />
<br />
In all honesty this fight should be INFESTED with lore, every 10 percent he should summon a miniboss like Resurrected Kel'thuzad and whatever not... and when you get those mini bosses down to 10% any of the heroes that want Arthas dead should come in and finish them and then join the rest of the fight....<br />
<br />

sorely disappointed, this will go down in history as a sad day in history.<br />

You can't tell from the video but before you engage Arthas you can see Bolvar hanging from chains above the throne.... so I guess during the fight he figures out how to escape.</div></div><hr />

Then again, people go on and on about how winning shouldn't be handed down.<br />
<br />
On the other hand we must all remember, everything that transpired in all of the Warcraft Series (and every game) was down to the player(s). I'm not saying you had a CHOICE in the matter, but you are the one who had to blow up all the alliance bases because Grom just HAD to provoke them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just hope though they don't make it so that every single lore figure that participates somehow gets incapacitated at the VERY beginning, it seems a little cheap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also guys, remember the fight always seems boring if you're not the one participating. You could stare at a video of Archimonde losing to some guild, but actually being stuck in there dodging whatever he throws at you and coordinating with your guildies is different.<br />
<br />
<br />
This. Lets wait to see it ourselves before we judge it. Who knows, maybe 25 man heroic is completely different.</div></div><hr />

Ah thank you i was wondering if that was some body or if my eyes tricked me.<br />

Its not about difficutly that &quot;just&quot; makes the fight harder and more intense when you play it.B But LK should have had a lot more lore to it. I'm really disappointed, doesnt look like they put really much effort into it.<br />

I totally agree. I thought we would at least see some cameos of some of the more popular lore characters that Arthas/Lich King has screwed over. At the very least Mal'Ganis and Mograine should've shown up. Seeing as how the Scarlet Onslaught became what they are because the Death knights destroyed the Cruisade and playable Death Knights are all because the Lich King made them to do so and then they revolted...</div></div><hr />

<br />
While it does seemed to have been over hyped in a sense of lore, that there really is general lack of it during the actual fight. From people that have experienced you get more at the end before the cinematic and stuff.<br />
<br />
But I also disagree in the opinion that is is anything but epic. The end of the fight makes it more &quot;epic&quot; then any other encounter in the game. Let alone the fighting. I think one some people see epic they expect the whole circus. Not everything has to be the most showy and flashy thing to be truly epic. If the lich kings fight was overly showy with transitions like Kael'thas it wouldn't have fit his character.<br />
<br />
That and the whole reason we are at him is because we just decimated and defiled his most powerful fortress and its most powerful people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic could always require you to dps Tirion out of the ice, kinda along the lines of Kalecgos. DPS him low enough that he can break free, but not so low that the aoe that kills players also takes him out. Could make it interesting. <br />
<br />
Of course it could always involve Bolvar.</div></div><hr />

I think he's chained up above the frozen throne, there's something (someone?) chained up there, and it looks like the burned to a crisp Bolvar.<br />

beat me to it<br />
yup, was about to say, you can see him hanging over the throne in the video, being tormented and all, ofc we haven't seen all the dialog leading up to the frozen throne and before the fight was started, so there's probably plenty of explaining</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. A video is mostly boring to look at, in comparison to doing stuff yourself. Try that.<br />
2. You only see &quot;half&quot; of the encounter, no Frostmourne area.<br />
3. It's an arcane mage pov, what do you expect?<br />
4. Look at all the Lich King's (or adds') abilities ( http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/patch-3-3-2-the-fall-of-the-lich-king/ ), and try to imagine how the raid needs to coordinate to deal with all that.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
for these points: actually a aracane mage pov isnt that bad, sure the gameplay is boring but you can see a lot and get not distracted so easily, tank pov is in most cases worthless.<br />
<br />
the abilities really dont make the whole lore around it more interesting. It makes it a better encounter strat and gameplay wise but you could make an awesome hard encounter without any lore and that really shouldnt be the case with the most significant badass in the WoW universe. Arthas is not the most powerful but compare his direct involved throughout the years to sargeras. sargeras is maybe the most powerful but his presence ingame is slim to none.</div></div><hr />

Correct, its a 20 minute fight and he needs to preserve mana. Doing normal rotation will make you oom in about 8 mins. However arcane can still be worth it as you can choose when you want the insane burst and preserve mana when dps is less important.</div></div><hr />

That's right, abilities are one thing, lore is another. But as I (and others) have said before, you don't even see the entire encounter, let alone the things going on before and after the actual fight. So in my opinion, it is a bit hasty to call the encounter boring after seeing one (incomplete) video of it, and without having done it yourself.<br />

I was watching your rotation and your use of Abarr (way to much of it) as well as how you used your CDs and when you waited. I bet, if you got everything going good you could pull another 1.5k dps. <br />
<br />
<br />
You are awesomesauce now go find that MuQQ (I guess the double Q does actually has a sense in his avatar name) guy and form an ultra awesome pew pew guild that will influence all da player base and make WoW a bettah place to be. <br />
<br />
You do realize it's like giving advice to an F1 driver on how to pilot his car while you are just doing car chase skirmishes with your friends in your local highway. <br />
<br />
Gratz to Blood Legion for world first 10 man and for giving us the chance to see the fight before we experience it ourselves and that's about it actually.<br />

<br />
<br />
Seeing as how I play a mage as well I was watching mainly the rotation to see how he handled the fight. <br />
<br />
Yes, you are right he did go to 4 stacks...BUT only when his mana was above 60% it seemed. Otherwise he was going 3 stacks into MBarr to conserve mana, the dps loss is minimal and the mana saved is great. When he went lower he was switching to using MBarr when it proc'd.</div></div><hr />

That's my favorite part. LOL!<br />
<br />
I'm gathering that in the 10 man version, the edge of the platform comes back up because 10 man is supposed to be easier, but if you get a double phase of the edge breaking (the first time the outer edge, the second time all the way to that inner ring), I can see how hard it really would be in 25 man - and how big an advantage to having those platforms return really would be, especially since the defiles seem to grow in diameter when you stand in them.<br />
<br />
Grats on the very nice kill, even if (supposedly) they did do it too slowly.<br />
<br />
On the topic of Ensidia drama: lololol - really? The platforms returning really didn't make any difference at all?! Really? omg...I was starting to give you the benefit of a doubt. Not to mention, where were you tanking Arthas that your rogues were chucking bombs with a 10-foot diameter that were hitting that platform? Not at Arthas, that's for certain. Sheesh.</div></div><hr />

Yes, yes they did. There is something to be said for having a near unplayable server. I didn't say they didn't deserve a kill, they made their strategy work, just saying that it doesn't appear that they did the fight as intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The edges fall off after Remorseless Winter ends and reappear when it begins. They rebuild on both 10 and 25. The advantage is not related to Defile as much as it relates to all of a certain phase where Val'kyr need to be DPSd down really fast (and in 25 man there are 3), or they throw the players off the edge. When the platforms respawned during that phase they dropped the players on solid land then despawned. No need for any DPS on Val'kyr, just pumping all of it into the Lich King.</div></div><hr />

What was he supposed to do? Do his mass-kill bomb as soon as the players and Tirion walk in, instead of at the end of the fight? Sure, it makes more sense, but it doesn't make for much of a fight or story.<br />
<br />
You sound like the people who, at the start of Wrath, said that Thrall and Varian were stupid for not taking the RAS super plague and carpet bombing Icecrown with it from the gunships. Sure, it would probably kill at least most of the scourge if not all of them and Arthas and makes more sense than not using it because the RAS used it first, but it doesn't make for much of a story.</div></div><hr />

It's not meant as an insult....he's just stating the facts. A 25 man raid is harder than a 10 man, and a 25 heroic is harder than a 25 man....common sense IMO, if anyone gets insulted by that then it's their own problem.<br />

I'm not against the harder portion of his comment. Mainly against how it would clearly be a more impressive video if done in 25. More bodies running around on a screen would not have made the kill video any more impressive than it already is.</div></div><hr />

The fight is over at 10%. The fight is tuned for be a 100%-10% fight instead of a 100%-0%. <br />

Well, yes. His plan was to kill the players and raise them as the new generals of the scourge. Going bombastic at the beginning of the fight would probably have accomplished that. Instead, he commits the fatal flaw of giving the opposing side a chance. <br />
<br />
Seriously, go read the evil overlord list and then look at everything Arthas has done in this expansion.<br />
<br />
I agree it wouldn't have made for much of a story, unfortunately the story that *is* there isn't much of a story. Arthas comes across as a comical villain, not someone to be taken seriously.

He was testing them during the encounter. If they survived his most brutal onslaught face-to-face with him, they were worthy. He made a fatal flaw, he kept Tirion alive. That's all.</div></div><hr />

I've got a gut feeling that you're trolling, but I'll go ahead and reply anyways... It's not like they wiped randomly at 10% and the game said, &quot;Well, good enough, lets give it to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
It makes COMPLETE sense that everyone dies. In fact, I was expecting it to take place long before anyone knew anything about ICC. The Lich King is so incredibly powerful that in the end, he decimates the 10/25 heroes that try to rise against him. As he says, it was his plan all along to have these heroes join his armies. What he doesn't anticipate is Tirion being capable of calling on Light to imbue his Ashbringer and ultimately defeat Frostmourne. While consumed by the souls of those his own blade had consumed, Terenas was able to save the heroes who had defiled the Lich King's Citadel from the ground up to make the final stand and destroy him once and for all.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />

<br />
5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object which is my one weakness.<br />
<br />
6. I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.<br />
<br />
10. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel well outside my borders will work just as well.<br />
<br />
11. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.<br />
<br />
20. Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss unexpected developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.<br />
<br />
24. I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line &quot;No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!&quot; (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)<br />
<br />
39. If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite number among his army.<br />
<br />
40. I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead of keeping it in reserve.<br />
<br />
47. If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I will slay him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for him to mature.<br />
<br />
75. I will instruct my Legions of Terror to attack the hero en masse, instead of standing around waiting while members break off and attack one or two at a time.<br />
<br />
80. If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my best troops instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones as he gets closer and closer to my fortress.<br />
<br />
85. I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, e.g. &quot;Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse.&quot; Instead it will be more along the lines of &quot;Push the button.&quot;<br />

My next song on my playlist was Muse - Map of the Problematique. Before it started playing, I got to a spotify commercial. At that time, I heard MotP playing, on a very low volume. I was like &quot;wtf? are the songs really supposed to play in the background when theres commercial?&quot; and it turned out almost exactly the same moment when I encountered the spotify commercial, that same song started playing IN the video x O Thought that was awesome.<br />
<br />
On the video, it seemed like a really epic fight. Almost makes me wanna play WoW again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drakonblayde</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was testing them during the encounter. If they survived his most brutal onslaught face-to-face with him, they were worthy. He made a fatal flaw, he kept Tirion alive. That's all.<br />
<br />
<br />
And let's think about this even further - <br />
<br />
Let's look at Ner'zhul as the Lich King. He was one crafty son of a bitch. He managed to engineer the downfall of the previous champion of the light (Mograine), as well as engineer the downfall of a prominent human kingdom. And he manages to outfox the sneaky Nathrezim and thwart Kil'jaeden's punishment. Then he goes and manages to save his spirtual behind when Kil'jaeden sends Illidan after him in retaliation. All in all, Ner'zhul got shit done.<br />
<br />
Now let's look at Arthas. His boss manages to take over Lordaeron, and then he manages to lose it, because a previous enemy he let 'live' was powerful enough to assert her own will. Great, just what the Scourge needed, a splinter faction that extends their war to yet another front. Then he sits on his ass for what, 5 to 10 years? He sends Kel'thuzad down to invade. That's a brilliant plan, the invasion is repelled on all fronts and he is forced to recall Naxxramas to Northrend. Then he manages to lose control of a large cadre of powerful death knights, as well as his death knight training program. And then he concots the brilliant plan to let the heroes march into his continent, establish beachheads, establish staging areas, and in the meantime, he can't even turn that wuss Bolvar to his side. So his sneaky plan is that, instead of destroying the strongest opposition to his rule (which he apparently has the power to do, but is reluctant to employ it), he decides to offer them jobs instead. Why the need for a culling of the best of the best? It's not like he has to make draft choices or worry about a salary cap or anything like that. He should have been treating the heroes of Azeroth like they're Pokemon instead of trying to form an All-Madden team! But nooo... he tries to be sneaky like Ner'zhul. You'd have thought he would have learned his lesson with Sylvannas about leaving powerful foes alive, but history repeats, and Tirion ends up pwning his ass.<br />
<br />
Arthas is a laughable super-foe. It is my sincere hope that Ner'zhul realized he made a HUGE mistake in merging with Arthas, and that he was working behind the scenes to engineer his downfall so he could grab a new host. I sincerely hope that the writers are pulling a page from the Diablo storybook and that Ner'zhul will smack down Bolvar and reassert his authority and return as the serious threat to all life that the Lich King was built up to be in Warcraft 3.</div></div><hr />

Fight doesnt seem to be that hard at first but there is lot of LK abilities (aoe+different adds) + frostmourne that we didnt see. You did a great job by killin him that &quot;fast&quot;. Loved the vent at the end showing us your surprise by discovering the content and being rez. Now people will know that they gonna be rez during the encounter but i can imagine how epic it should be for ya to discover it.<br />
<br />
Like some i wouldve like more from jaina,varian,tirion,darion,etc but i still like how the fight is. Yes maybe there will be some different mechanic for heroic but not that much.<br />
<br />
GG again ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
ps: id like to know too if ya can talk to bolvar after cinematic or something else than just teleport out.</div></div><hr />

Our server was lagging to hell at night, so we took a break and came back to kill it.<br />

After Arthas Menethil, mortal host of the Lich King, is slain, Tirion Fordring prepares to place the Helm of Domination, the crown of the Lich King, on his head. Seated upon the Frozen Throne, his body warped by dragon fire, Bolvar intervened, stopping Tirion from taking the burden on himself. As a last act of service to Azeroth, Bolvar asks Tirion to put the Helm of Domination on his head so, as the Lich King, he may keep the undead under control. Bolvar says no one must know what happened, and that Tirion should say that the Lich King is dead, and Bolvar Fordragon died with him.</div></div><hr />

What's funny is as much of a joke as Arthas apparently is he still overpowered and outplayed Ner'Zhul. So hyping up someone who got punked by a sucker is laughable in itself. <br />
<br />
Besides, with Frostmourne destroyed that poses two things. One, nobody can whine about not being able to loot Frostmourne. And two, the eyes/ears/soul collector/etc of Ner'Zhul is gone. But that's alright, they can always change how significant the armor or weapon is whenever they want, given they've done it a few times already.</div></div><hr />

If the parts with people going into Frostmourne's room were recorded, you'd better understand why it's so weak when Tirion knocks it from Arthas.</div></div><hr />

There's a very special treat for those in store for 10/25 Hardmode Lich King.<br />

Wait until that's killed before you start yelling about Blizzard for not giving an epic ending!</div></div><hr />

Yea sure they will...lol<br />
<br />
They also said this would be the most epic battle ever....<br />
<br />
He gets killed in 1 day. They should of made it so hard that in march we all still be attempting to bring him down. Not a day after the patch is released. And they did this incremental thing cause they knew it would happen. Once again, blizz fails to provide quality to their billion dollar industry. Every year, i see how less and less they care for their players.</div></div><hr />

Just curious though, what addon if it is an addon was that that showed what gems to put in the sockets for the weapons????<br />
<br />
At the very end you cursor over the first staff, and it shows a yellow and a red socket....and next to it, it shows you should put a 23 sp and a 12sp/?? in the other 1.<br />
