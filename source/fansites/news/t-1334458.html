<br />
World of Warcraft Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar is almost upon us. To help you prepare, we’ve provided an overview of vital information you need to know so things go smoothly when patch day arrives. You can also review the current Public Test Realm patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266872-54-ptr-patch-notes-august-20/), or even download and play on the PTR itself for a taste of what’s to come.<br />
<br />
The new patch brings a new raid, many class changes, a new PvP season, and a whole new questing area. It also marks the end of the Battlefield: Barrens event. Read on to learn how you can be best prepared to dive into the adventure when Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar hits.<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
There are changes coming to every class in Patch 5.4, including glyphs and abilities, as well as alterations to established mechanics like Vengeance. This is an excellent time to head over to the Public Test Realm patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266872-54-ptr-patch-notes-august-20/) to begin familiarizing yourself with what to expect when you log in on patch day. Do keep in mind however that the PTR notes aren’t final, and things could still change before the patch.<br />
<br />
Don’t forget to check out Ghostcrawler’s Dev Watercooler: Dissecting Patch 5.4 Class Changes (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10580508/), where the doughty crab drops some knowledge on the reasons behind the class updates you’ll be seeing.<br />
<br />
Currency Conversions<br />
Justice and Valor won’t be converted in Patch 5.4, but with the PvP Season turnover, you can expect your Conquest to be converted to Honor as usual.<br />
<br />
Please be aware that the conversion cost of Justice to Honor is going up, and it will cost 500 Justice to purchase 250 Honor.<br />
<br />
Where’s the New Valor Gear?<br />
There won’t be a new Valor Quartermaster come 5.4. Instead, we invite those of you intent on gearing up quickly to face Patch 5.4’s challenges to visit the new Timeless Isle. You can get a taste of what’s to come by reading Bashiok’s Timeless Isle preview (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10590712/The_Timeless_Isle%E2%80%94Take_Your_Time-8_14_2013).<br />
<br />
The Ethereals who offer Item Upgrades are sticking around, so you’ll still be able to spend your Valor on upgrading your existing gear.<br />
<br />
PvP Updates<br />
Season 14 Begins!<br />
PVP Season 14 arrives with Patch 5.4, which means a few different things. First, Season 14 Grievous gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-green-text=20&amp;filter-search=Grievous) will become available. Elite versions of Season 14 Grievous (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-green-text=21&amp;filter-search=Grievous) will also be available as a mark of prestige for players that reach a personal rating of 2,000 and earn 27,000 Conquest Points over the course of the season, and the non-Elite pieces will no longer be a pre-requisite to purchase them. The prior season’s Season 13 Tyrannical gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-green-text=18&amp;filter-search=Tyrannical) will be available for purchase with Honor Points, while Season 12 Malevolent gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-green-text=16&amp;filter-search=Malevolent&amp;filter-slot=2026) can now be crafted. Finally, equipping any pair of PvP trinkets from Season 12 or later will grant a 10% reduction in damage taken from other players.<br />
<br />
New Arena System<br />
Big, big changes are coming to how Arenas are organized in Patch 5.4. The most important part is that players will no longer need to create or join an Arena team to compete. Similar to the Rated Battleground system, players in a party of the appropriate size (even cross-realm!) can queue for an Arena bracket of the same size as their party (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5).<br />
<br />
For the details regarding how Arenas work in 5.4, check out Daxxarri’s blog on the subject: Patch 5.4 Arena Update (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10333782/Patch_54_Arena_Update-7_1_2013).<br />
<br />
Be Prepared<br />
The Vale of Eternal Blossoms and the Golden Lotus<br />
You might already be aware that Garrosh’s callous actions will bring great destruction to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10624923/Patch_54_Siege_of_Orgrimmar_Trailer_Unleashed-8_15_2013). This also means that the majestic pagoda that once housed the Golden Lotus will be no more.<br />
<br />
While this is truly a tragedy, the Golden Lotus fight on. You can still complete quests for them, as well as earn reputation with the Golden Lotus by slaying their enemies in the Vale. Get the details from Nethaera’s write up: Patch 5.4: Destruction of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10624922/Patch_54_Destruction_of_the_Vale_of_Eternal_Blossoms-8_14_2013)<br />
<br />
Battlefield: Barrens<br />
The conflict that has been occurring in the Barrens is culminating in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid, but that also means that the various quests offered there, as well as the Darkspear Rebellion Quartermaster, will no longer be available once the patch hits. If you want any of the items that the Quartermaster provides, such as Xan’tish’s Flute (http://www.wowdb.com/items/98552-xantishs-flute) or Latent Kor’Kron armors (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Latent+Kor), then your time grows short!<br />
<br />
While the quests and the Quartermaster will be gone, the Kor’kron and their camps will remain in the Barrens (though it will no longer be possible to get the various Battlefield: Barrens supplies from them), and those foes will now drop Gahz’rooki’s Summoning Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97821-gahzrookis-summoning-stone), Raptorhide Boxing Gloves (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97990-raptorhide-boxing-gloves), and the Kor’Kron Supply Satchel (http://www.wowdb.com/items/98059-korkron-supply-satchel).<br />
<br />
Attention title hounds! The Battlefield: Barrens exclusive titles, Hordebreaker (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8306-hordebreaker) (Alliance) and Darkspear Revolutionary (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8307-darkspear-revolutionary) (Horde) disappear with this patch! If you want either one, you’d better get out there and finish the quest line before it’s gone.<br />
<br />
Attention Transmogrification enthusiasts! Griftah’s Authentic Troll Shoes (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97901-griftahs-authentic-troll-shoes) are disappearing with Patch 5.4! They may return again at some point in the future, but if you want to be sure to have them, this would be a great time to visit the Barrens and help out the Darkspear Rebellion.<br />
<br />
Wowhead has posted a useful guide that can help you make sure to get the most from Battlefield: Barrens before it’s gone.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Archaeology<br />
The Mantid Artifact Sonic Locator (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95509-mantid-artifact-sonic-locator) is seeing some changes (you can read the PTR patch notes for details), but the big news for now is that it will be more difficult to obtain in the future, so you maybe want to grab yours now.<br />
<br />
New Craftable Raid &amp; PvP Gear<br />
New for 5.4 crafting materials will be usable to craft new Raid and PvP gear. You’ll be able to learn how to create the new crafting materials via recipes that drops from creatures in Pandaria. Be sure to check out the Professions section of the patch notes to see if it might be a good idea to hold onto some of the mats that you’ve already got stashed.<br />
<br />
Fishing<br />
With the destruction in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Jewel Danios (http://www.wowdb.com/items/74863-jewel-danio) have been airlifted to their new habitat on the Timeless Isle... where you can fish them up!<br />
<br />
Patching Smoothly<br />
It’s easy to make sure that you’re ready to play when the realms become available on patch day. If you haven’t played in a while, then one of the simplest things you can do is open the World of Warcraft launcher, and allow the updater to download the latest available game files. If you use approved User Interface AddOns, make sure you have the latest versions and that they’re updated and ready to go (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1536706542) for the new patch. This is also a good time to update your video card’s drivers, to ensure that there aren’t any compatibility issues.<br />
<br />
If you experience any patching issues, there’s a technical support forum thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3840664036) all about patching that could help. You can also follow @BlizzardCS (https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS) on Twitter for the latest support-related news.<br />
<br />
Getting Additional Account Help<br />
Help with account and in-game issues is just a few clicks away. There may already be a post that addresses your concern on the Customer Support forum, and reading the posts there can be very helpful; the stickied posts at the top are a good first stop, and will help you get the most out of the forum.<br />
<br />
The Blizzard Support site (https://us.battle.net/support/en/games/wow) provides options like searching through available solutions (https://us.battle.net/support/en/games/wow), or, if the self-help options don’t do the trick, submitting a support ticket might help you get back into the game fast.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and we’ll see you in Azeroth!</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The new patch brings a new raid, many class changes, a new PvP season, and a whole new questing area.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would take this to mean the PvP Season will end at midnight on 9/9 followed by a week of no arena/rbg. The original announcement for the 27th mentioned it was scheduled to end, not that it was final.</div></div><hr />

On topic: I want a shot at Garrosh. I want the chance for that Kor'kron Wolf mount. I also want to see WTF precisely happens. Does Vol'jin finally get to deliver on his promise?

Does Garrosh actually kill Thrall before being taken down? Lots of questions, answers.. incoming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no game is really &quot;a threat&quot; but it's pretty foolish to delay a patch, when people will be bored. bored people might try ff14...and like it! (it's actually pretty good, messed with the beta a bit)<br />
<br />
in any case, seems like progress on PTR has come to a halt, must be cause there are a bunch of class balance issues still. that and raid testing.</div></div><hr />

Probably for the AoE healing causing the game's performance to drop. They think it's worth postponing the release to fix this.<br />

I think the game is good too I have enjoyed it, but no point in releasing a patch that isn't finished even if a new game is coming out. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard seen it as a threat they would prbly rush the testing just to push it out next week. But they did they smart thing waiting which makes me happy that I have time to play FF14 &amp; not worry about raid for 2 weeks :D.</div></div><hr />

So You're saying that day/month/year is more logical, than month/day/year?<br />
day/month is so confusing. Seriously what's the point of starting the date with the day? I want to know the month first, then the day...<br />
month/day is much better I think it should be used everywhere.<br />
BTW In Hungary we use year/month/day. I think that's cool just like month/day/year.</div></div><hr />

Disincentivizing spamming PvE 5-mans to get PvP gear? Sounds like a clear win to me. People should PvP if they want PvP gear.<br />
<br />
Then remove the 72% base line resillience from all players. If you want to pvp wear pvp gear.</div></div><hr />

'We' That game will fail just as SWTOR, Rift &amp; TERA did. Free to play in a few months time.<br />

The only MMO's worth a mention is Wildstarr and Everquest Next. But none will be WoW killers but hopefully they will be decent like Guild Wars 2. Its nice to have MMO options sadly there isnt much to choose from this cesspit of carcasses.</div></div><hr />

Uhhm, they didnt fully go out and say 100% RELEASE ON 27th. It said when pvp season ends or something like that and other tweets.<br />
Either way its kinda saddening, but figures with how testing has been.<br />
Maybe they'll properly balance some specs now</div></div><hr />

I believe the string of posts from Blizzard went something like:<br />
*PvP Season will end as soon as August 27th.<br />
*Patch 5.4 will herald the end of the PvP Season<br />
<br />
Meaning that most people inferred that August 27th was when we would see the patch, but never did Blizzard actually say that the patch would be arriving on August 27th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And they said the patch would release on the same day. That is confirmation. So now they're saying it's the 10th. What if it gets delayed? Will I be seeing you again on that post saying they NEVER officially said it would be the 10th?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, they corrected the Date of the end of PVP Season.<br />
<br />
Now reads:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As soon as Tuesday, September 10, the 13th Arena and Rated Battleground Season is scheduled to end. On that day we'll begin an approximately one week process to determine end-of-season reward eligibilitys.<br />

day/month is so confusing. Seriously what's the point of starting the date with the day? I want to know the month first, then the day...<br />
month/day is much better I think it should be used everywhere.<br />
BTW In Hungary we use year/month/day. I think that's cool just like month/day/year.<br />
Day/month/year is the most logical imo.<br />

Really? I had a lot of fun with it. To me it felt akin to leaving EQ for WoW: a breath of fresh air, and I say that after 8.5 years of WoW. I don't have enough exposure to WildStar to form an opinion, and I'm thoroughly unimpressed with EQN, but again, limited exposure.<br />

The reason why we use the month first is so that it eliminates confusion. A date like 6/12/2013 is extremely confusing of one person reads it as 'June 12th' but another person reads it as 'December 6th.' If everyone is taught in school the month comes first, then it will always be June 6th and not 6th june.</div></div><hr />

There won’t be a new Valor Quartermaster come 5.4. Instead, we invite those of you intent on gearing up quickly to face Patch 5.4’s challenges to visit the new Timeless Isle. You can get a taste of what’s to come by reading Bashiok’s Timeless Isle preview.<br />
<br />
The Ethereals who offer Item Upgrades are sticking around, so you’ll still be able to spend your Valor on upgrading your existing gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fucking terrible. I cannot express how blindingly stupid it is not to offer new valor gear for players. I am so glad I uninstalled this trash a couple days ago.

Instead of VP, you can go farm the Timeless Island for coins and use those as currency for items. You know this, right?<br />
<br />
http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103986-discipline-of-xuen#related:sold-by<br />
<br />
And really, though, with them offering -several- different means to obtain gear in a raid, you're better off doing the content. You'll get more upgrades per week vs. using Valor as some sort of means to obtain gear.<br />
<br />
LFR, Flex, Normal/Heroic. Potential 42 bosses a week if you really wanted to go that route.<br />
<br />
Edit: And if actually doing the content is too troublesome a task to obtain gear, why do you even want gear in the first place? I don't understand people who want VP gear but don't actually do the content. Those items are just rotting away. It's like furnishing a house, but not ever having anyone over. &quot;We bought a new card table&quot;, &quot;Oh, I didn't know you played cards?&quot; &quot;I don't.&quot; &quot;....&quot;</div></div><hr />

so... being able to grind all your valor gear whenever you want and putting the amount of time it takes to get all your valor gear in how long you work on it is worse then being forced to only getting one piece a week?</div></div><hr />

When I say the date out I say, September(9), tenth(10), two-thousand and thirteen(2013). So for me 9/10/2013 makes more sense. Also it is in order of smallest possible to largest possible number.<br />

The actual use makes a lot of sense to me. For example, when my kid was born:<br />
&quot;He was born in May.&quot;<br />
&quot;What day?&quot;<br />
&quot;May 25th.&quot;<br />
&quot;How long ago?&quot;<br />
&quot;May 25, 2009.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you remember exactly when?&quot;<br />
&quot;He was born exactly May 25, 2009 at 7:02 AM. We were in labor overnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it makes more sense. You start your description vague then get more specific. It's like someone asking you what time the movie is showing. &quot;It's on Friday at 7:30 PM, would you like to come join us?&quot; Probably because I've grown accustomed to it though.</div></div><hr />

Once again, MMO-Champion has edited a Blue post to remove links to their competitors. If you edit Blue posts, I cannot trust that you are presenting them accurately or honestly. You preserve all other hyperlinks, just not those to Wowhead. I understand they are your competition, but tough shit. That doesn't mean you get to change what Blizzard says.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoca821fe2863</div><div class="date">2013-08-22, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I say the date out I say, September(9), tenth(10), two-thousand and thirteen(2013). So for me 9/10/2013 makes more sense. Also it is in order of smallest possible to largest possible number.<br />
<br />
On a similar note, why does every conversation between Americans and Europeans have to devolve into nitpicking semantic bullshit?<br />
<br />
I guess half of these comments wouldn't even have happened if the image just said &quot;09/10/2013&quot; instead of &quot;09.10.2013&quot;.<br />
On the other hand, the news title and the headline in the newspost clearly state the date unmistakably, so I guess people just argue for the sake of arguing.</div></div><hr />

Eh, they removed the link but the spirit of the line is intact. I don't see a problem here. Anyone that wants to can easily go to wowhead and search for the guide. It's not like anyone here won't know (or at the very least couldn't just google) wowhead. I could see a slippery slope argument here so maybe it bears watching but I'd say it's not yet something to worry about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaneem</div><div class="date">2013-08-22, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual use makes a lot of sense to me. For example, when my kid was born:<br />
&quot;He was born in May.&quot;<br />
&quot;What day?&quot;<br />
&quot;May 25th.&quot;<br />
&quot;How long ago?&quot;<br />
&quot;May 25, 2009.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you remember exactly when?&quot;<br />
&quot;He was born exactly May 25, 2009 at 7:02 AM. We were in labor overnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it makes more sense. You start your description vague then get more specific. It's like someone asking you what time the movie is showing. &quot;It's on Friday at 7:30 PM, would you like to come join us?&quot; Probably because I've grown accustomed to it though.<br />
<br />
Or:<br />
...<br />
&quot;Do you remember exactly when?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, 7:02 AM on the 25th of May, 2009. We were in labor overnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are many ways to phrase time and dates when it comes to speech, and most are perfectly fine. If you believe &quot;You start your description vague then get more specific&quot; is true, then you would say then Date would be formatted YYYY/MM/DD not MM/DD/YYYY. The later is just absolutely bizarre and your argument does no match up.<br />
<br />
YYYY/MM/DD is the best format (for purpose of date sorting), followed by DD/MM/YYYY (in terms of ordering LSB&gt;&gt;MSB). MM/DD/YYYY is just as screwy as say YYYY/DD/MM would be.<br />

Hey, A point on the grinding for Valor.... I read somewhere that there are NO Valor quarter masters in 5.4... so am I right in saying not to both with Valor? Other than having some on hand for upgrading gear?</div></div><hr />

With Season 13 ending soon, we finally have a potential release date for Patch 5.4. There are still many things that could delay the patch, so keep in mind that this date is not final!<br />

They have repeatedly done this. One time a Blue post made explicit reference to Wowhead, including a link, and the MMO-Champ post edited it to say &quot;fansite&quot; and changed the link to wowdb. If they are willing to change words that come out of Blizzard's mouth, they cannot be trusted as a reliable reporter of information.</div></div><hr />

awesome blizz thanks! :)<br />
<br />
so 9/5/2013<br />
<br />
Is that September 5th or may 9th, best when speaking to an international audience to say it out. I prefer little to big to bigger.<br />

Clearly says the 10th in the US, ya know, where 9/11 actually happened. So you making a stink about it being released on 9/11 when it means absolutely nothing where you're from makes no sense.<br />

<br />
<br />
The 27th was never promised it was tagged with a subject to change. It was never guaranteed to come out on the 27th. and by now you should know not to believe the first date that is handed out.<br />
<br />
Then what is the fucking point to releasing the first date? Why even bother saying aug 27th? Saying something like &quot;as soon as&quot; is just useless. Like I said earlier, the next expansion is coming out as soon as September 17th. Blizzard going on twitter and saying something like that would be just as ridiculous as saying august 27th. They messed up, they gave a date, they shouldn't have, it got delayed, they gave another date with the same dumbass wording.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty much exactly what I was about to say. I immediately knew when I read the sentence that there should have been a link in there somewhere, but they removed it because it's wowhead. So lame. Found the link anyways, guess i'll just start going there to begin with.</div></div><hr />

What? The ability to enchant any item level is a fairly nice addition. Granted, it's probably only a prelude to prof revamp, but still...</div></div><hr />
