Argent Tournament Champion's Seals<br />
The current plan is to add more ways to get champion seals in future patch. How many? Even we aren't sure at this time. Yes, it takes a lot of seals to collect everything, but we are okay with that as players will prioritize what they want to get so not everybody will have everything in one month and players who want everything will be able to get it all... eventually.

Fishing - Monsterbelly Appetite (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=13836) daily quest<br />
Last time I did this I didn't hit any fishing node and it took me about 5 casts. Currently we are okay with the number of casts it takes to complete the Terrorfish fishing daily which tends to take me a lot longer, so the monsterbelly one is fine. The fishing daily requires fishing time. <br />
<br />
[...] The character I do these on is maxed and gets no gray items and the fishing dailies are done fairly quickly - I think the longest any of them have taken (and I have done them every day) is like 25 casts and that was for the Terrorfish. I would say to keep working on leveling your fishing and it should get faster over time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16474245458-monsterbelly-apettite-poorly-implemented.html))<br />

Ulduar Nerfs<br />
Daelo summed it up pretty well in his post on the Raid and Dungeon forum: &quot;We want to allow additional players to experience more of the cool Ulduar content.&quot;<br />
<br />
We want dungeons, including Ulduar, to be accessible for players. If everything is difficult then few players will experience the content that we have been working on for several months now. At the same time a lot of the hard modes have been increased in difficulty to give players something more challenging to work toward. <br />
<br />
10-Man Ulduar Difficulty<br />
It was to provide another progression path for players who aren't interested in trying to find a bigger group to run with. A lot of players have just enough friends online to fit into a 10 player group and we didn't want to force the need to get another 15 players to see the raid content as we want it to be more accessible.<br />
<br />
Yes, the 10 player raids are meant to be a bit easier, but they are still challenging and not meant to just be the easy mode that people close their eyes and walk through. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16473765044-youre-nerfing-ulduar-again.html))</div></div><hr />

Easy mode lets you ignore a lot of the fight mechanics now. And hard mode is apparently designed for world top 50 guilds, with many of the fights requiring massive raid stacking. <br />
<br />
WTB medium difficulty with mechanics you have to respect, reasonable raid composition flexibility, and genuine excitement when a boss goes down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
achievements? <br />
<br />
There are plenty of them that aren't hard mode but take a coordinated group to accomplish. There's really an absolute TON of achievements in this set compared to Naxx, and that's what the people who think the normal modes are too easy but the hard modes are too hard should be going for. <br />
<br />
And then in theory once your group has accomplished all of the achievements that aren't attached to a hard mode, your group should be more or less ready and able to start tackling the hard modes if you're not the kind of guild that just starts off on the hard stuff. <br />
<br />
I personally think it's a good balance so far, although honestly the 10-man normal mode things are a bit too tough for a lot of groups because your margin for error is significantly less than in 25-man which I think may be a bit too easy.</div></div><hr />

By which I do not target the people who are killing things in ulduar and make the correct observation that the content is either too entry level or too hard but nothing in between. But those who can't even kill things in there shouldn't complain about ulduar getting easier, since it's because of them the content does get nerfed.<br />

Balance? WTF are you talking about the balance its from it. I'm sorry but if you stand in Freya's sunbeam you SHOULD be insta-gibed on normal. Its seriously not hard to move 3 yards out of it. <br />
<br />
If you don't heal the person in the Slag Bot they should die, and your healers should be ridiculed for being to stupid to read or configure GRID properly. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally my guild is what I would call a slightly above average guild and we got Yogg 25 with relatively little problems once we overcame the bugs in some of the events. And i think the Nerfs are why to soon and way to much.<br />
<br />
If people want to &quot;See the content&quot; then run a 10 man group. The 25 mans are suppose to &quot;offer more challenge and better loot&quot;. They should seriously wait till they FIX all the problematic BUGS that are making the fights difficult or imposable for lower guilds and give people a chance to LEARN the fights before they go hacking the legs off the bosses. Cutting health by 20-30% on some bosses is pretty sad when the content is only a few weeks old and all but few hard modes have been defeated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I won't really comment on Uld 10 as I am not interested in it, but I will comment on the Ulduar 25 changes. In so far as I am concerned they were all needed. My guild has been wiping at Auriya 25, or whatever the hell her name is, for two weeks now. We have been raiding every single day from 20:00 to 24:00 and we have managed to make no progress beyond Auriya. We have lost already three people who have been with the guild for a long time, namely a Warrior Tank (one of our OT's), a Priest (who said that she could not stand raiding every day of the week for 4 hours) and a DPS warrior (who said that he was off to find a more casual guild as he could not stand raiding every single day).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but how is that possible? How can you be stuck on that boss for two weeks with 4 hours of raiding a day? You are doing something _very_ wrong in the encounter then. I play in a pretty casual guild (raids two times a week) and we got her down after 1 hour of trying the first reset and have the first 8 bosses on farm already.<br />
<br />
With that much time spent you should have taken yogg a long time ago. If you just play for fun and not to down bosses that's ok of course, but then don't whine about the difficulty on the forums.<br />
<br />
On-topic:<br />
Some of the fixes where called for and some of the nerfs where unneccesary, but I'm not that concerned that it will be complete easy-mode just yet. Time will show though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though I don't see how this is relevant since I don't bitch about ulduar being either too hard or too easy or becoming too easy, sure. Before last reset we cleared up to Thorim. 25 mans btw, I haven't set foot into 10 mans at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pity that because at the beginning it really felt like a achievement when we downed a Boss.<br />
<br />
We had enormous lagg...5 seconds before a spell was casted, unless that we killed Ignis without a sweat.<br />
<br />
XI-001, we really fucked it up big time at our first try, he got 2 times healed by a bot. And still we killed the crackhead.<br />

and Kologarn...they nerfed him to be equal to a Naxx boss.<br />

Sure, the first few bosses are pretty easy now but isn't that what the first few bosses are for ?<br />
Go complain when you kill the last few bosses within 1 - 2 hours of trying.<br />

And even then you can still do the achievements and hard modes.<br />

<br />
We cleared Ulduar 25 the first week and only the last 3 bosses really took effort and time. We thought mimirion was gonna be a guildstopper, but now the damage etc is nerfed (and some bugs which had to be fixed), but they nerfed the encounter aswell. Other bosses before mimirion took each 1-2hours max to crack it, and now they'r gonna make it even easier. The few loots you can gain with hardmodes won't make the biggest difference in the world, blizz just made hardmodes an excuse to give a easy 25men. Bit dissapointed, at start of ulduar first week it seemed it was gonna be a good dungeon with a challenge to entertain &quot;lesser&quot; guilds for weeks,even months. Think blizzard waited with the nerfs till you had some first world kills, imagine how fast Ensidia and other guilds would had cleared ulduar with these current nerfs...<br />
Glad i did everything pre-nerf, cause the bosses without engaging hardmode already feel the same as naxxramas. But yea just my 2-cents<br />
<br />
If u don't believe me Armory run &quot;Razzax Alius Orbis agamaggan EU &quot;.. If that makes my opinion worth more</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't anywhere near possible you dudes popped Twilight Vanquisher and are wiping on Auriaya for a shitload of hours over DAYS. When so, there is no justification rewarding your raid with further loots.<br />
<br />
sad but true! <br />
<br />
the nerfs of the first ulduar bosses suck.. it's just the lagg what makes them a little bit difficult.<br />
by the way nobody needs to be a hardcore raider du succeed in ulduar 25 normal mode.. it just<br />
takes some time, not every raid instance should be cleared easy and fast like naxx. and when<br />
you're wiping for weeks on the first encounters then you should change the tactic or some players<br />
need to learn 2 play...<br />
<br />
ps: the first bosses shouldn't be the hardest yeah but not to easy as well... and compared to<br />
the 1st bwl bosses a long time ago they were even pre-nerf pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

Could you clear something up for me? <br />
<br />
I'm assuming none of your guild played on the PTR. None of you read up any strategy guides that had taken other guilds weeks/months to sort out. You sat there and analysed combat logsand worked it all out for yourselves.<br />
<br />
Wow you must be amazing to do all that. You must have been raiding 24/7.<br />
<br />
Seriously gtfo with that type of bullshit statement. Even if you didn't play on the PTR, you absolutely must of used the boss guides around. Apparently within the WoW community these &quot;cheat sheets&quot; are acceptable. Then it also appears that after cheating, you can claim the content is too easy. Well done. <br />
<br />
Come back to me and slap your dick on the table when you've killed Algalon.<br />
<br />
In fact you can link your achievement in game biatch.<br />
<br />
Isah, Agammaggan EU<br />
<br />
PS: I'm personally enjoying UD25. We're progressing slowly. Raid twice a week, and, yes we use strategy guides, but I'm not trying to brag about how the I've cleared UD25 and how easy it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't get it do you. Lots of guilds at different levels of ability all trying to do the same content. Some are not 1-shotting the content. Others are. If you are 1-shotting the content, then try a hardmode. Blizz want anybody that can organise 10/25 people to be able to see Ulduar. If it's too easy for you, then they have given you the option of trying a hardmode. The best guilds in the world are still banging their heads against some of the hardmodes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2009-04-30, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunally, I'm not part of the progression group from my guild, so I could only try Ulduar 25 once (two weeks ago now) with ppl who have the same &quot;raid slot problem&quot; as me + some alts from the &quot;main raiding group&quot; (and not exactly geared for Ulduar). We managed to one shot Flame Leviathan and killed Razorscale after a few wipes (4 or 5). Couldn't kill XT due to, what looked like, lack of DPS and ppl called for the night.<br />
<br />
After that, did Ulduar 10 with my friends + 1 pug, using my alt (DK blood tank/dps, used the dps spec there) last week. Both my tank and dps gear are from Naxx10/Heroic/Blue Icecrown Quest (so one or two ilvl175+ and all the rest ilvl200, except for Death's Bite ilvl213). We managed to kill Flame Leviathan after 5 or 6 wipes (learning how to use everything from the diferent vehicles), got the Shutout achievement in the end, and one-shot Razorscale.<br />
<br />
Ppl decided to skip Ignis because of the know bugs and went XT. We couldn't kill it. For me, raid problem not encounter dificult level. We had a feral druid using his healing spec (with worse healing gear than his feral one) for the entire raid, another healer disconnecting between razor and xt, a OT who went dps spec to help the dps, etc. and the pug wasn't that good when we needed him to do something else than facerolling the boss (both on vehicles on FL and helping with scrapbots on XT) so not a good geared raid for XT maybe.<br />
<br />
Hope we can get ppl together today for another atempt in Ulduar 10, let's see how easy things got.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course,I understand,no more SWP hundreds of wipes,but it's good when you wipe 10/20/30(depends on guild) times and you finally manage to kill the boss.This IS fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see why people think that wiping because of stupid stuff 20 or 30 times is fun. My life is stressful as it is, I come to the game to have fun and raid and get some loot. I don't raid to be frustrated as hell because someone can't move out of the fire/void zone/etc etc. I want to get in, bullshit on vent, maybe not one shot it- but I don't want to wipe 20 to 30 times either. This game should not be stressful, it is a game. And people who get too excited over &quot;casuals&quot; and nerfs are people who think that only the best of the best should be playing this game and don't think about the people who just want to get stuff done without a lot of grief.<br />
<br />
Keep your hard modes, they are there for the people like you. Let everyone else have the easy modes.</div></div><hr />

I wish they would stop nerfing even 10 mans. I always liked 10 mans better because my computer lags a bit when it comes to 25s so I think 10 man should be made just as hard. We take our time and learn the fights the way we are supposed to and are doing great so far. We are far from a casual guild and raid 3-5 hours a night 4-5 days a week. I hate how bliz said originally they wanted 10 man to be an alternate progression path but then says they want to make it easier for all the casuals. STOP nerfing 10 man content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wuzzle</div><div class="date">2009-04-30, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So... I feel really sad about recent changes.<br />
<br />
I'm in a 10 Man Raiding guild that tries to combine skill and Achievements with the 10 man content simply because you can't find 25 excelent players on our realm without breaking up existing guilds and consume their good members and hiring/filtering a huge amount of new members.<br />
We maybe have 14 skilled players and 2 till 3 that yet have to learn how things work or buy a new computer.<br />
We don't care about clearing everything in easymode so we decided to run hardmodes right from the start even with our shitty raidcomp and a few guys with subpar equip.<br />
On XT-002 a comparison between the hardmode and the easy one is not even possible. In hardmode there are loads of incoming damage and you have to beat down a lot of hp. In easymode you can simply nuke the heart to 2% and the deconstructor instantly jumps to the next &quot;heartdropping-phase&quot; that it's almost not possible to not get the 2mins5sec-achievement.<br />
<br />
As for Ignis. That encounter already has been very easy. When we first downed him we had only one Tank and had to position him with those adds inside the flames to be able to kill them. That easily worked out even with that &quot;melee-bug&quot;. Now with those nerfs you can simply sleep during that battle if you have an OT to deal with those adds.<br />
<br />
I don't want to talk about razorscale... that encounter is as faceroll as dealing damage with a retribution paladin.<br />
(Yeah I do play one ...)<br />
<br />
fazit: if you don't do hardmodes, simply nuke the shit out of every encounter ... mechanics do not need to be thought of. Just do it like you did in Naxx.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't mind that this conent will be as fastly overfarmed as Naxx ... but then they have to give more content! Faster! More! And Faster!<br />
<br />
<br />
Also on a sidenote: I like it if the players complaining about bosses being to difficult don't even know their name. Hoooray for Kills that make me smile and remember the name of an encounter.<br />
(You know ... if you don't know the name of that encounter you slayed just know ... it simply was not hard enough.)<br />
<br />
<br />
But then again, this game is not for nerds anymore... this game is for all the guys who pay and those who play 2 hours in a week pay the same amount of money somebody pays who nerds the shit out of his life.<br />
In the past the quality of an mmo was that there has always been something to reach. Even if you are one of the best there is allways something almost impossible to obtain that keeps you running. Blizzard has rewritten that mmo-mentality and made WoW mass compatible. A game for everyone. now it's nothing more than a rpg that you can play through to the end and then wait for an Addon to bring new things to do. it's just a game with different difficulties: If you played it through on easy mode you've seen almost everything and even tho you can play it on a harder difficulty you just see the same crap again just with a few more abilities you have to consider.<br />
But there's one difference: there is no medium... every game has a medium difficulty for those who do not play this genre the first time keyboardturning and almost &quot;cheating&quot; their way through the levels... except WoW.<br />
<br />
Thats how people like it: Epics for free. You don't have to be that good you don't have to learn much. Just pay the game itself and roll the dice for loot.<br />
<br />
I don't like it, but i have no voice... I don't pay the accounts of the keyboard turning and void wiping masses ;)<br />
<br />
And arenas are meant to be an esport :&gt; Hahaha eat this casual!<br />

My life is stressful as it is, I come to the game to have fun and raid and get some loot. I don't raid to be frustrated as hell because someone can't move out of the fire/void zone/etc etc. I want to get in, bullshit on vent, maybe not one shot it- but I don't want to wipe 20 to 30 times either. This game should not be stressful, it is a game. And people who get too excited over &quot;casuals&quot; and nerfs are people who think that only the best of the best should be playing this game and don't think about the people who just want to get stuff done without a lot of grief.<br />
<br />
Keep your hard modes, they are there for the people like you. Let everyone else have the easy modes.<br />
<br />
I'm not a hardcore raider,we killed only 4 bosses on 25man so far(lacking some dedicated ppl,but currently we are merging so it should be better)and 12/14 on 10 man.<br />
I just don't know why they are making things so eaaasy(you'll see,a few weeks and it'll be naxx)isn't it better for ppl to cooperate with each other,to play better and progress step by step?<br />
They will finally see all content after few weeks.</div></div><hr />

All along they said that Ulduar would be solely for raiding guilds and the like.<br />
<br />
Now they've decided they want it basically free to everyone since they put a lot of work into it?<br />
<br />
Seems harsh. I'm not in a raiding guild, and accept that I can't do Ulduar. That's fine, since there must be *something* for the raiding guilds to do.</div></div><hr />

Daelo summed it up pretty well in his post on the Raid and Dungeon forum: &quot;We want to allow additional players to experience more of the cool Ulduar content.&quot;<br />
<br />
We want dungeons, including Ulduar, to be accessible for players. If everything is difficult then few players will experience the content so they leave and Vivendi won't get their money anymore. So we nerf Ulduar to keep these money bags in.<br />

Link your armory with all of the Ulduar Achievements completed or piss off really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't you get it? The people here that are complaining about the Ulduar nerfs - most of them haven't cleared it all yet. Therefore, that makes their words more valuable than the people that have. Of course the people that have cleared everything wouldn't want stuff to be nerfed, b/c they want to be the only ones on their server that can do it. The rest of us(like some people that seem to be serious-casuals here) are enjoying the fact that Ulduar cannot be pugged and we find satisfaction when we kill bosses for our first time. Yes you can look at my armory and I've only killed the first 7 bosses, but my guild doesn't mind progressing because that is WHAT RAIDING IS SUPPOSED TO BE. <br />
<br />
If you don't like wiping and using consumables and learning strategies then accept the fact that raiding isn't for you, and don't try to change it but rather find something else to do. Seriously.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming none of your guild played on the PTR. None of you read up any strategy guides that had taken other guilds weeks/months to sort out. You sat there and analysed combat logsand worked it all out for yourselves.<br />
<br />
Wow you must be amazing to do all that. You must have been raiding 24/7.<br />
<br />
Seriously gtfo with that type of bullshit statement. Even if you didn't play on the PTR, you absolutely must of used the boss guides around. Apparently within the WoW community these &quot;cheat sheets&quot; are acceptable. Then it also appears that after cheating, you can claim the content is too easy. Well done. <br />
<br />
Come back to me and slap your dick on the table when you've killed Algalon.<br />
<br />
In fact you can link your achievement in game biatch.<br />

PS: I'm personally enjoying UD25. We're progressing slowly. Raid twice a week, and, yes we use strategy guides, but I'm not trying to brag about how the I've cleared UD25 and how easy it was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty much anyone who knows how to play the game and wants to succeed at it is going to use strategy guides, read EJ forums, watch tankspot videos etc. What's the harm in that? You still have to know how to execute it. It's not like everyone can go read the strategy and do it perfectly the first try. Nothing is the same as doing the fight yourself.<br />
<br />
The problem is these guilds that are complaining about how hard the content is are the ones who do NOT read guides. If you choose to not read guides that is perfectly fine, but then expect to wipe a lot as you learn the fight. If you don't like wiping then it's your fault for not using the resources available to you.<br />
<br />
No, it's not cheating, because Blizzard would ban those sites if they considered it cheating. It's merely sharing and discussing experiences and strategies with each other. If you can't kill a boss because your DPSers are only pulling 2k, your healers are dying to void zones, your tanks can't pick up adds fast enough or hold aggro, or some of your members are not in full Naxx25 then you have problems yourself. The content is not the problem.</div></div><hr />

If you read my post, I mentioned that I used them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Guides are cheats, in the same way, getting stuck on a console FPS and reading up on what to do is cheating. You are cheating yourself. No one else. Blizz doesn't mind. It allows those raiders (I include myself in this) to take on complicated fights and know what to expect. Execution is a completely different issue.<br />
<br />
However when you come on to a forum and boast about how easy UD25 is 1 week after it's release, well TBH, by now you should be on to hardmode achievements by now. UD25 'content' is not going to be done until Algalon is dead. Have a feeling that is going to be some months yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Shut up and do the hardmodes for loot and badges appropriate to your difficulty preference.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2. Shut up and do the normal modes, and recognize that by choosing to not engage the game at maximum difficulty settings, you give up the right to complain about Ulduar difficulty.<br />
<br />
The argument that the lower difficulty modes should not exist is a stupid and myopic business model. When Wrath released, there was so much QQ over easy content, and fairly said, the only thing you got from Sarth3D was a mount. Now you get loot that's better to distinguish yourself. What's your argument again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ulduar is like SSC - Vashj. You won't see anymore of those wipes thats true, but SwP was end endgame in tbc, Ulduar is one of the middle raids in WotlK. The 3.2 raid and Icecrown are another steps in difficulty. <br />
<br />
However me in a casual guild that raid 10man and 25man equally think the nerfs should stop. It will help my guild alot in progress thats true cause we have people of every level of skill, but now some of us already think they should leave it as it is atm so we have some challenge in the next weeks/months :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya'll are living in the past.<br />
<br />
Killing a boss is no longer the only accomplishment. Well, it IS part of it but now it's not the only measure of a guild or player's skill. <br />
<br />
The true measure is the hard modes and achievements. <br />
<br />
Think about it this way. <br />
<br />
Sarth with no drakes up. Easy cake. <br />
<br />
Sarth with 3 drakes up. Most challenging encounter pre-Ulduar. <br />
<br />
People bragging about killing bosses are retarded. Yes, you are. Killing bosses is an accomplishment, yes it is, but the REAL accomplishments are the hard modes and the absolute fuck-ton of random Achievements they put in for Ulduar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clearing the content&quot; is no longer the &quot;end-all&quot; of raiding. Clearing the content is just the BEGINNING of raiding. <br />
<br />
It's genius. Blizzard's absolute genius.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that the &quot;hardcore&quot; who still view clearing the content as an achievement are too fuck-tarded to realize that they are stuck in a pre-achievement-system mindset and need to adapt to the new direction or simply shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it will take a while, especially for people spending multiple raid weeks on normal mode Auriya.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, Blizzard is going to continue nerfing normal mode Ulduar into the ground. Is anyone else as worried as I am that the exact same thing will happen to Icecrown? <br />
<br />
Blizzard said Naxx was easy because it was the first raiding tier. Ulduar was supposed to be so much harder, but it was a bit too hard, so it was nerfed. And nerfed repeatedly so soon. But it's only the second tier of raiding, so that's ok.<br />
<br />
So what happens when we get to Icecrown and it's the third or fourth tier of WOTLK raiding? Will we have instant nerfs so everyone can explore the instance in the first month? I fear for the playability and longevity (replay value) of WoW's future content.</div></div><hr />

Cause casuals is where they get their cash. Like I said in a previous post Casuals &gt; Hardcore. Burn through the &quot;easy&quot; stuff....then go for hardmode. If you can't understand that simple concept........well......<br />
<br />
You people seriously need to stop bitching. The days of &quot;vanilla&quot; WoW are OVER! Why should Blizzard work for months on a new instance just to cater to 5% of the population. You guys aren't that special. They threw you guys a bone with hardmode....so go....enjoy.<br />

Hardmodes. They were implemented for those seeking challenges. What rocks were you guys hiding under to miss it? If the easy mode is too easy... ramp up the fucking difficulty, Jesus Christ, it's like WoW is your first game ever or something...</div></div><hr />

Keep your hard modes, they are there for the people like you. Let everyone else have the easy modes.<br />

I mean really is it THAT hard to move out of a void zone, Or Run away from the raid if you get Light/Gravity Bomb? Get real if your raid members can complete the simplest of tasks such as &quot;Move away from the spot on the ground that will kill you&quot; then maybe you should look in to your recruitment.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should have taken the time to fix more of the bugs with the encounters and given people more time to LEARN the fights and develop strats before they started nerfing things.<br />
<br />
If you want to be casual go play 10mans, 25mans are suppose to be significantly harder and the reward should be better. If you cry because your guild is full of tards that cant move out of &quot;Sun Beams&quot; or avoid &quot;Shadow Crash&quot; then then should not be in 25man raids. Get better raiders or get a better guild, you pick but dont make the the majority of raider pay for your incompetence.</div></div><hr />

Ulduar is ment to improve players in raiding both 10 and 25 man content. If you nerf 10 man, people will just get carried in 25 man.</div></div><hr />

You have someone who isn't doing their part in a ten man group, well your most likely pretty screwed. I've seen 10 naxxs that caused constant wipes on Gluth because one hunter couldn't kite his adds for the life of them...and this person wasn't getting kicked out because of guild politics and such. Yet, this same 'huntard' shows up in 25 naxx groups and their incompetence is less of a problem. So, in my eyes 25 mans are easier. I've cleared 25 naxx far more times than I've cleared 10.</div></div><hr />

I, and many others, are not complaining that Ulduar is too easy. I think it is challenging. And it is FUN challenging. At this point in time you have to obey fight mechanics in order to kill a boss. We AREN'T one-shotting everything. Everyone in the guild thinks it's fun. The point that many people are trying to make is that by giving an overall nerf to Ulduar is that it WON'T be fun anymore. Yeah you can say &quot;well there's still hard modes&quot; but as everyone is saying it's only the top top guilds that are completing them. Even on my server, Forgotten Heroes(who is in the top 50 US guilds) only has 2 towers and Runemaster hard modes done but they had Yogg down on week 1. So basically, there's nothing in between extremely-casual and extremely-hardcore. <br />

I mean honestly, how many people think Naxx is fun? The only part that's fun is feeling like you're awesome because you can just go in there and steamroll the place. I'd rather have challenges than steamrolls.</div></div><hr />
