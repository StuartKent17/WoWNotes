The underwater breathing was useful long ago when other races couldn't stay underwater for very long, but when they greatly extended the time all the races could stay underwater it became almost useless. Plus any quests where you are underwater for long usually provided some sort of breathing potion/bladder, etc. This will make undead the Horde race of choice for pvp for sure.</div></div><hr />

Neat changes overall. I'm really curious about what the visual for &quot;borrowed time&quot; glyph will be. I haven't seen much disc love yet in the glyph department, and I'm really excited to see what else we will have to chose from.<br />
<br />
The new glyphed shackle undead range is really good for pvp. I wonder how targeting will work for that, since I really hate how it currently functions. As a healing priest, changing targets simply to shackle undead for a few seconds is rarely worthwhile (sometimes the only opening needed to kill me or my partner). I rarely use it except for in duels. The simply switch to auto-target would justify the cast time and break from healing.</div></div><hr />

The pvp ones should be obvious, simply because they're meant to be for the toon that got the ranking. The class ones are also a no-brainer, as much as I'd love my rogue to run around on a dreadsteed. And the high gold cost ones make sense because they're supposed to be high-cost vanity items, and they can be purchased again if you want. All of the rare-drops are account bound.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, the rare-drop ones mean less people farming for their alts (Time-lost, etc). The gold-cost ones are either sold by a vendor or are tied to a profession. The profession mounts in particular are important because if they were to be account-bound, it would damage the market for them.</div></div><hr />

Didn't even notice them until you mentioned them. They're in the style of flowers you'd put on a grave though and if you see the context of the MoP style it fits. It's not like they became treehuggers or something xD. I like it.<br />
<br />
Seems they thought up a way to make enhance get more use out of haste. It might not be entirely up to standard of what it haste is supposed to mean.<br />
Everytime I see a mail piece with haste, and crit for the matter, on it I die a little inside (a crit/haste piece sends you into rigor mortis). This could solve the issue though of only having one actual useful secondary stat (mastery) outside of the ones that need to be capped.<br />

2) Class mounts are shared cross-account? Really? Goddamn, why don't you just make all the classes the same. First the class quests, now this.<br />
3) Undead actually got a useful racial...wow.<br />
<br />
1 i agree rogue set looks badass tho the helm ishit and miss to me atm<br />
2 class mounts are non account wide re read it and on that note mechana hog not being account wide i call bullshit on seriously.<br />
and 3 they said racials were gonna get tweeked and that is a sexy racial for undead and my lone undead is a spriest to boot :)<br />
<br />
side note t14 dk i'm a lil hit and miss i'd have to see it on my orc to judge that one and shaman looks pretty sweet imho</div></div><hr />

<br />
This leads me to believe this xpack will be released after Brewfest but before Hollow's End.<br />
<br />
Brewfest ends, October 5th. Hollow's end starts Oct 18th. Blizzard releases on a Tuesday and Oct 9th falls in the middle of the Darkmoon faire. So that leaves Oct 16th!<br />
<br />
<br />

I am REALLY not going to waste that much gold more than once - and now I think I'm not gonna do it even once, until those mounts are last on my list to collect.<br />
<br />
I was expecting them to become account wide as well. I am not spending gold or materials on those mounts for alts at all, regardless of so-called gold sink status. To be honest, the fact that they're gold sinks should be reason to be account wide, not to be restricted, at least in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I see I did misread that Non Account Bound Mount list; i'm glad I don't see my Yaks there though.<br />

Ah yes, the panthers too. And those carpets, which don't even exist as mounts. At least not yet.<br />
<br />
I don't honestly see why those mounts aren't becoming account wide. For the gold sink status? I don't see anyone, except those with more gold than they can spend, buying such mounts more than once. I know I didn't up to this day, and I still won't.<br />
<br />
Regardless, it's not something worth crying about. I disagree with it, but meh, whatever. I was more concerned about other mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The purpose of the mounts that cost a lot of gold is to create gold sinks. If they removed those gold sinks they would just have to re-create them somewhere else. Better they stay the way they are.<br />
<br />
Mounts with very low drop rates can take months and months to acquire, and are not simply a gold sink, but a massive time investment (unless you're incredibly lucky)<br />

I can see the logic behind it though. The fact that they can be bought from a vendor with gold, as opposed to completely random to obtain, makes them a target for not being account wide, making us earn more gold if we want to use them on some alt.<br />
<br />
I disagree with that, but I can see why they're doing it.</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine wanting to play any other class if they get something that amazing for PVP. I hope that Belfs get something worthwhile. I was already considering a switch to Troll for berserking, since it's far superior for PVE (and still great in pvp). I only need arcane torrent for arena these days; its effects are barely noticeable in PVE at 85, and its range is abysmal.<br />
<br />
Undead racial will depend on the proc rate. I'd hope it gives comparable healing to Gift of the Naaru. 20% health every 3mins. Thats what, 1% health every 9sec or 0.3% every 3sec? But if it has a higher proc rate, it could definitely be a game changer for undead rogues/locks/other high self healing classes!!</div></div><hr />

Sadly, it is Poseidus indeed. Another one that I find kinda dumb to be restricted.<br />

A bit soon for that. The intent is probably to have it somewhat balanced with Blood Fury and Berserking, I hope. It's still too early to call nerf on it, but I like the mechanic.<br />

I can't imagine more than a small percent of the player-base wanted them restricted. Most of those who did want them restricted probably already bought them on multiple characters and thus have an interest in them remaining per-character.<br />

For some reason they seem to be backing away from their philosophy of &quot;you earned it, not the character.&quot; I can almost guarantee we will see a blue post explaining how they are starting 'conservatively' so that they can extend it later, like they did with transmogrifying legendary weapons and/or that they feel the need to preserve the goldsinks (even though people have had ample time to purchase them before the announcement of account-wide mounts, leading me to believe that they failed as a long-term goldsink with any meaning).<br />
<br />
Not to sound like a whining, threaten-to-quit scrub, but they have made my decision of resubbing so much less complicated.</div></div><hr />

While those mounts are debatable, I'm sure it will be extremely unpopular to all the top PvPers that their drakes aren't account-wide. Those are straight up achievements that should be shared across all toons. Bad move Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping we get a blue post that confirms which specific restrictions will be present with account-wide mounts, if any. A vague/ambiguous blue post saying &quot;it's still beta, things can change&quot; is unacceptable. Once we have an authoritative post to reference, the players will be able to make informed decisions about the game.</div></div><hr />

I know the ONLY reason I dropped 40k gold on a Vial was because I expected it would be a one-time purchase and all my characters would benefit from it. <br />
<br />
I get that they are trying to keep goldsinks in the game, but that's what the BMAH is for. Doing this vastly limits the amount of gold people will spend. I was going to buy an Expedition Yak because it seemed to be account-wide, but no way am I wasting 60,000g when I already have a Tundra Mammoth on my main. This change would do little more than limit the amount of people willing to pay for mounts. The number of people who would buy the same expensive mount twice is far smaller than the amount that would buy the mount if it was a one-time purchase.<br />
<br />
I mean, what's better for a sever economy gold sink; 100 people buying two 50,000g mounts each, or 1,000 people buying one 50,000g mount each?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The logic behind this new feature should be &quot;a person earned a mount once and they should not need to earn it again&quot;.<br />
<br />
Its hard to lvl a profession, its hard to farm the mats to make most of the mounts, it would be a reward be able to use them across my chars, because its very rare that someone will lvl the same profession again in another char, usually ppl lvl different professions on alts.<br />
<br />
Ofc some restrictions still apply, but IMHO the ones that have some LOGIC and can be understandable are class-mounts and ofc faction-mounts, because they are attached to the core of something. <br />
<br />
Profession-mounts aren't really a &quot;core&quot; thing. No one will spec someone to see &quot;oh, he is really a JC&quot;, it really doesn't matter and will hurt no one if once you lvled a profession and crafted the mount (that is still bind on pick-up btw) you can use it across all your chars.<br />
<br />
Arena mounts restricted? Why? The person worked hard to get that mount, why can't he use the mount in another char? If he stopped to play that char an awesome reward will be always forgotten? Why? Where is the logic?<br />
<br />
Reputation mounts? Same thing, you worked hard to get the reputation with that faction to buy the mount, you shouldn't need to grind / farm it again in another char. Its not fun.<br />
<br />
Expensive mounts? Again, you worked hard to farm a lot of gold and you can use in just ONE char? You are just making gold sellers very happy and players very upset. <br />
<br />
Anyway.. the sad part is that it will likely go live on MoP this way =/</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree. This is by far the best looking DK tier so far. It finally actually captures that &quot;I am become death&quot; feel in a badass/creepy way that isn't too over the top. There are only 3 skulls, chill. Also, the &quot;black roses&quot; are a sick touch.</div></div><hr />

I don't honestly see why those mounts aren't becoming account wide. For the gold sink status? I don't see anyone, except those with more gold than they can spend, buying such mounts more than once. I know I didn't up to this day, and I still won't.<br />
<br />
Regardless, it's not something worth crying about. I disagree with it, but meh, whatever. I was more concerned about other mounts.<br />
<br />
exactly, its not a gold sink, if 99% people cant even afford it in the first place. I got by by not having tundra mammoth just fine for two expansions, but when I heard about account wide mounts, i realized it would be cool to have it on leveling alts etc, because honestly? If I wanted mammoth and repairs, I have the Mel francis one for Justice and leveling engineering for jeeves is cheaper than buying that. Shouldnt have been so rash and should have waited with buying it until we got list of banned mounts.<br />

The pvp ones should be obvious, simply because they're meant to be for the toon that got the ranking. The class ones are also a no-brainer, as much as I'd love my rogue to run around on a dreadsteed. And the high gold cost ones make sense because they're supposed to be high-cost vanity items, and they can be purchased again if you want. All of the rare-drops are account bound.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, the rare-drop ones mean less people farming for their alts (Time-lost, etc). The gold-cost ones are either sold by a vendor or are tied to a profession. The profession mounts in particular are important because if they were to be account-bound, it would damage the market for them.<br />

Completely agree, plus would be a bit silly if all my new characters could use the traveler's tundra and the perks it provides</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but you can't achieve that ranking without skill. Granting it account-wide would be rewarding that player's skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely agree, plus would be a bit silly if all my new characters could use the traveler's tundra and the perks it provides <br />
<br />
That shouldn't be a problem if they add a level requirements for the mounts. Same for proffesion's. Just make low level characters and/or low proffesions unable to summon it.<br />
<br />
I mean, I understand you but all these changes still forces me to keep playing with my old main. :(</div></div><hr />

Kezan and Lost Isles are with the Maelstrom as they always have been. Pandaria is much further south. How exactly do you get it so you can see the download before they patch it?

<br />
Because Forsaken offer zero pve benefit and between 5% and 9% behind orcs in BIS pve gear and underwater breathing offers zero benefit after they buffed the breath meter years ago?<br />
<br />
Forsaken needed it, it sucks feeling like you clicked &quot;the wrong button&quot; on class creation so suffer a dps penalty. I'd rather they just nerfed all racials to not offer a flat dps increase and be more flavour, but this is better than a zero dps increase in a world of OP racials like orcs and pandaren.</div></div><hr />

No, this is wrong. <br />

<br />
This is the original alpha concept for Kezan back in early WoW development. Not only is it supposed to be where Pandaria is now, it's also supposed to be HUGE. For comparison, in lore, Bilgewater Harbour is just a relatively small harbour city on the northwest coast of Kezan. In the game they made it take up the whole northern coast.<br />
<br />
Blizzard really screwed the pooch on that one. Before Cata was announced, people were hoping for a Southern Seas expansion with Kezan as a focal multi-zone point. After Cata was announced, people were hoping that 4.3 would see Kezan introduced as a couple of daily quest zones and the host of the Deathwing raid. So much disappointment and wasted potential, and now it seems Kezan is doomed to its downgraded miserable shade of its former self.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganush</div><div class="date">2012-06-01, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm disappointed at restricting any mounts beyond Class-specific or profession-required mounts. I know the ONLY reason I dropped 40k gold on a Vial was because I expected it would be a one-time purchase and all my characters would benefit from it. <br />
<br />
I get that they are trying to keep goldsinks in the game, but that's what the BMAH is for. Doing this vastly limits the amount of gold people will spend. I was going to buy an Expedition Yak because it seemed to be account-wide, but no way am I wasting 60,000g when I already have a Tundra Mammoth on my main. This change would do little more than limit the amount of people willing to pay for mounts. The number of people who would buy the same expensive mount twice is far smaller than the amount that would buy the mount if it was a one-time purchase.<br />
<br />
I mean, what's better for a sever economy gold sink; 100 people buying two 50,000g mounts each, or 1,000 people buying one 50,000g mount each?<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to agree with that. Vial isn't really worth the money to me for one character, but I was going to buy one if it was cross account. I have been waiting for a list of what mounts would not be cross account because I wasn't going to buy one unless they were. It's just not worth the investment to me if it's just for one character (and I have more than enough gold to afford one). Given this list, I won't be purchasing a Vial on one character let alone multiples. I believe they would pull more gold out of the system if they make expensive mounts account wide than if they don't. I also believe it would benefit crafters in terms of more sales as more people are likely to buy a mount for their account than for an individual character. I'm sure JC's would sell more panthers in MoP if people were purchasing them for their accounts.</div></div><hr />

The flying carpets (at least, those ever implemented) and flying machines are going to be account wide.<br />
<br />
<br />
So does this mean they're bringing them back at some point? What would be the point of even mentioning them? I feel like I just answered my own question.The never-implemented WotLK Mooncloth/Shadoweave/Spellfire flying carpets, like the Goblin Mini Hotrod, are still in the data, and didn't get flagged as &quot;account-wide&quot;, so when somebody doing data-mining pulls a list of all mounts in the data files, and filters out all of the ones not flagged &quot;account-wide&quot;, these never-implemented mounts will show up on that list.<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;original&quot; three carpets aren't there either. Those are new carpets. Personally, I'm bouncing off the walls to be able to use my rofl-copter and icy carpet again, having profession changed several times since Wrath.Profession-restricted mounts, while they are indeed account-wide, are still profession-restricted. So even though the current flying carpets and flying machines will show up on all of your characters, and count toward any individual character's 'X mounts' achievements, only characters currently with the profession will be able to mount up on them. So if you make a Frosty Flying Carpet, all of you tailors can ride it once they get their tailoring up, but your non-tailors can't. Just like your below-60's can't ride those flying mounts that they'll have in their mount list.</div></div><hr />

Uh, this is just the original concept for its inclusion in WoW. It's been canon in the lore books for the longest time. There are several descriptions of its location and its geography. Heck, Deathwing's lair was actually originally supposed to be on there as well. It was supposed to be where Pandaria will be, and it was supposed to be huge.

Yeah, true, the never-implemented flying carpets got me there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, IMHO they just need to remove the profession-restricted requirements. It will work much better with this new feature / logic behind account-wide mounts. They will still be BoP, so we still will need to lvl up the profession, farm the mats and craft it, but then I can use the amazing mount in all my chars.<br />
Its a win-win situation because will not hurt the gold economy, will not really hurt any &quot;core&quot; aspect of the game - no one really cares if the person using the mount have the profession on that char, if its BoP they already know that at some point the person lvled and crafted it, its not like a free mount.<br />
<br />
Its a big chance, I know, but it does make sense now.<br />

It's not really much of an 'achievement' to acquire them. But if you spend 3 weeks camping out Storm Peaks to find the TLPD, or if you are the lucky one to get the Headless Horseman's Reigns, it's an achievement that Blizz feels you should be able to show off on any of your characters, not just the one you happened to be on when you got the drop. Plus the person whose &quot;mount collector&quot; character is no longer their main doesn't have to go out and re-buy all of those 8g mounts all over again, re-farm holiday mounts, re-do mount-granting achievements, etc just to show off their mount collection on their new mains; all they need to do is re-do their gold sink purchases.</div></div><hr />
