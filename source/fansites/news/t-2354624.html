Honestly probably to give you less of a reason to do the Garrison stuff aside from Grumpus. Since it's old content I can see how they'd want to phase it out, especially since a lot of Garrison stuff has been nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Do random dungeon.. Just before boss dies. Pop pot and complete bonus objectives that were already setup.<br />

Comments like this are cancer. They FINALLY repair early game and all I hear is whining about boost. Of course people like you just want Blizzard to mail them 12 max level boosts with best gear, so you could &quot;enjoying alts&quot;... and whine about &quot;nothing to do&quot; next day. Seriously, fuck this attitude.<br />
<br />
And no, questing through different zones isn't a grind - something like killing boars or doing same dungeon over and over again is.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.<br />
<br />
Leveling is not fun at all after the first few times, and leveling 110 (soon 120) levels is just a complete pain that some people don't want to endure, especially if they're not even sure they'll enjoy the class.<br />
<br />
I'm only missing a Warrior right now (and a Monk but he's 91 so that is manageable), but I won't buy a token for him. Already bought a 25€ token for my Pal. And I'm sure as hell I won't be leveling him the regular way.</div></div><hr />

Reduce leveling speed and much higher time to kill that adds at minimum 8 hours to the leveling experience(with Heirlooms) while reducing the effectiveness of heirlooms at all levels.<br />

Yes, because levelling was way, way too short. And was all about spaming dungeons. Of course fun is subjective. Seems like for people like you geting instant rewards for no effort is somehow fun. But this is illusion, since most of you just whine about &quot;nothing to do&quot; next time you finish something.</div></div><hr />

Do tell the benefits of the &quot;new leveling experience&quot; for both veteran and new players?<br />

I have 12 Legion alts and plenty above 90 across multiple servers.<br />
I have plenty to do and have never complained in the slightest about it.<br />

I have even collected over 100 Legendaries from Legion and I am still collecting them.<br />

Seriously, I have to explain why questing through always relevant content with multiple choices of zones/dungeons at any stage is better experience than spaming LFD or doing weird shit like stuff with potion and bonus objectives?<br />
<br />
And of course these changes are directed for new people (and encourage veterans to do content that they probably skipped in the past), not for altoholics with army of chars. There is no design that is good for both. When you give people easy way to skip stuff, they will always choose quicker path. But it make levelling broken and irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Also, don't count on any further reaction from me. In your last post you just talked about your altoholism and called me a fanboy, so you probably out of arguments already. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because people think the new leveling system is going to suddenly make leveling hard and tedious again. It really isn't. We aren't going back to the pre WoW style of leveling or anywhere near Vanilla because if we did then people would know. <br />
<br />
XP requirements per level seems to be up by 40%. Which doesn't matter considering zones scale now so even if you run out of quests you can just go to another. And nearly every zone in EK/Kalimdor scales from a new minimum level upto 60 so you won't run out of places to go. Blasted lands for example now has a minimum of 40-60.<br />
<br />
Mob health has been increased to be more on par to your level. You can still easily 2-3 shot mobs. They also hit like a wet noodle. So either a damage increase hasn't been implemented or it's intentional. I was getting hit for 100-200 of my 5k health without Heirlooms on PTR at level 41.<br />
<br />
If leveling was easy for you now it's not going to change in terms of difficulty. Probably take a bit more time at most.</div></div><hr />

So what, I don't care about you, I don't have all those above 90 characters and I love creating new toons and leveling them. For me the changes to the leveling system are awesome and I can't wait to take full advantage of it when the patch is released. Anyone that doesn't like it can still buy a character boost the same way they do now and they can still dungeon grind just like they do now too. Nothing is changing except for those of us that level the old fashioned way.</div></div><hr />

Why bother with these trolls? They are very very low in numbers, most of the wow community already stated that they hated the new leveling system, it's going to give the devs a big backlash, let them make the classic servers, I bet 70% of the so called &quot;classic lovers&quot; will be back to BfA within a week or so...</div></div><hr />

I thought he might be a legitimate player with a real reason for his desire for wanting the &quot;new leveling experience&quot; and all of it's flaws.<br />

There is plenty of time for people to provide feedback and come to a consensus on what is acceptable for everyone within the community.</div></div><hr />
