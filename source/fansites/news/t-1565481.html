Garrison Lumber<br />
We're watching the spawns and experiences people are having. It's an easy enough number to tune. The question is: Are you just hanging around one zone or are you moving around? What tier is your LM? At level 1 it's going to be more difficult to fill your work orders since you can only log small timber. Also, timber spawns are much more plentiful in Spires/Nagrand.<br />
<br />
Good feedback. Few notes:<br />
<br />
Lumber Mill level 2 (and all medium plot blueprints for that matter) unlock at level 98 on the blueprint vendor. You can also get a token for a medium building by completing the Spires of Arak building quest chain.<br />
Small timber exists in every zone (except Frostfire). Spires is probably the most densely spawned with small timber, with Talador a close second.<br />
You can currently use timber to buy a few more things and we'll try to add more. At the very least if you ever manage to get Phylarch you'll likely want a steady supply on hand for Everbloom Seeds.<br />
<br />
That said, we'll take a look at the spawn points. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329835-sooo-about-the-lumber/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13682248279?page=1#8))<br />

Next Beta Build<br />
We weren't able to get a new full build deployed this week (aside from the minor fastpatch we did on Wednesday to fix some Garrison issues), but we're hoping to get a beta build out to you all early next week.<br />
<br />
Thanks for being patient, and thanks for testing! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329757-will-we-see-a-new-beta-build-today/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13680208005?page=1#18))<br />

Blood Elf Model Delay<br />
yes but it was expected to be more than one race. Not having half done for the release actually feels better to me than leaving out one.<br />
Yeah I understand that, feeling like the odd one out. But just think about that patch when you do get your updated model. Everyone else's models will be common by then, everyone will have been seeing them every day. But when the new Blood Elf model goes in it's going to be a new thing, and everyone will be focused on you and how fancy you look.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the kind of 'fashionably late' style a Blood Elf would appreciate. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329715-no-blood-elf-models-in-wod-launch/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13681698157?page=2#35))<br />

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br />
On beta, haste is not affecting Healing Stream Totem nor Healing Tide Totem tics. Is that intended?<br />
Rejoice, for we have rebuilt Healing Stream Totem and Healing Tide Totem. They now will function 100% like any other periodic effect. No more fuzzy haste breakpoints due to server laziness of despawning totems. You even get partial ticks of them due to haste.<br />
<br />
Check it out in the next beta build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=27#540))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
this is the same for most hybrids, 1 gcd vs scores to throw out rejuvs, healing touches<br />
We absolutely do not balance utility by expecting anyone to switch to primarily healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889072969318401))<br />
The fact that a Boomkin could stop DPSing and throw Rejuvs on the raid does not factor into it at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889188870520832))<br />
The fact that they could keep DPSing and let Ysera's Gift or Nature's Vigil do a ton of healing *does* though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889322199068672))<br />
Sorry if I ever gave the impression that we are counting &quot;stop DPSing and Flash of Light&quot; as raid utility. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889572116684800))<br />
Dream of Cenarius, Heart of the Wild? If NV healing is = increased healing from amp magic, that's nice.<br />
Heart of the Wild is a separate beast of its own. It's an option to provide *WAY* more utility, at a DPS loss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492892166104965120))<br />
The availability of HotW is not what Druid utility is based around. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492892259382091778))<br />

In the simplest possible terms, using other abilities other than Frost Strike is punitive and inefficient.<br />
Not if it doesn't cause you to lose Frost Strikes... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492891887133405185))<br />
Except it does, runic power becomes runes, runes become RP, it is all connected, inefficient in 1 area affects all<br />
The conversion from RP to Dmg/Runes is better for Frost than the others. But so what? They're balanced around it (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492893135081467905))<br />
It's a leaky bucket. As long as it never overflows, it doesn't matter whether you pull RP or Runes out first. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492893728080547840))<br />
<br />
What would your response be to nixing 2H out of Frost entirely? Would save yourself from further headaches.<br />
Response would be &quot;No.&quot; (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493840921121660929))<br />
May I ask why? I am honestly trying to figure out the need for both, no trolling.<br />
Because that's the defined style of the spec. Changing that now would be gigantic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493841829712773120))<br />

This makes 2 niche talents for Feral at level 100. Are you that confident that the majority of Ferals will be happy with LI?<br />
I don't understand. Shirvallah is the opposite of a niche talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493097249753141248))<br />

Why not just make the Divine Storm free of cost? That way it's less clunky and people who want DS happy?<br />
That'd make it used for single target. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492882662114070529))<br />
<br />
I'm curious is there any reason why DS shouldn't be allowed single target? I mean both DK's and Warriors AoE single target.<br />
It's not that it's AoE so much as it's added complication. That talent is intended to be the one with minimal gameplay impact. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492898418088366081))<br />
However, I'm not quite sure how the Divine Storm proc from Final Verdict being free would add much more complication.<br />
It adds an additional button to your single target rotation. That's pretty objectively added complication. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492901262413676544))<br />
True, but would it not be more confusing to people to see they have a Divine Storm proc that they *Shouldn't* use single target?<br />
A fair question. It's something we're weighing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492901942180335616))<br />
<br />
So for AoE you want to weave in Final Verdicts everytime you want to Divine Storm? Or is the proc worth it ST?<br />
Proc will not make it worth it, single target. But it will make it so you want to alternate them for AoE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492877379933442048))<br />
wait...if it's a 100% buff, isn't it a complete wash compared to just using DS exclusively?<br />
Except you can do it ahead of time, and you also got the FV damage too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883185584197634))<br />
<br />
So, Rets had too much raid utility...if that were true they'd be guaranteed spots in raid/wanted a lot more.<br />
No, damage throughput has a lot to do with that too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883024099303424))<br />
<br />
Don't know how I feel about this...I would like to ask you why remove raid utility from a hybrid but give to a pure dps?<br />
Because pure vs hybrid isn't relevant to this. The goal is parity for all. Anyone we removed it from had too much. Some had none. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492881299904794625))<br />
Do you value all utility as equal or is there more to it?<br />
The value of utility is very hard to balance; commonly totally subjective. Tough calls to make, but we try. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492882785703428096))<br />
You are taking away from a class that sees little play and giving to a class that was already well off.<br />
There are no 'giving from one to the other' things here. And many other changes are involved. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883486185771010))<br />
Remember, the goal is *balance*. Equality. That should be what you want. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883551633694723))<br />
Devo Aura was the only reason Rets were used in MoP. We will be in less raids now.<br />
You lost Devo... Others lost a ton too. Overall raid cooldown utility went way down. Again: *balance*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884799825010689))<br />
<br />
... I understand if offheals are far stronger than live/healers weaker but ret flash of light vs smoke bomb?<br />
Ret utility is easy to overlook because it's not as blatant as Smoke Bomb. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883757087485952))<br />
There is, however, a ton of it. Many are situational, but some subsection is always useful. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492883980530626561))<br />
Hand of Sacrifice. Hand of Protection. Hand of Purity. Double all those Hands. Sacred Shield. Lay on Hands. ...(cont) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884180120768513))<br />
Lay on Hands. Level 90 talents' offhealing. Hand of Freedom. Divine Shield. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492884508387975169))<br />
So how do you balance this? Do we do more damage than rogues seeing as we trade massive dmg for our utility compared?<br />
What? How do you trade &quot;massive damage&quot; for your utility? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492887367246561280))<br />
Considering you count exec sentence as part of our utility, which is a pretty large dmg loss to use that way.<br />
I was mostly referring to Light's Hammer (or Holy Prism, if we tune that better). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492888629417488384))<br />
That's still a single target dmg loss to take those...(I assume you wouldn't tune them better single target)<br />
But most fights are not single target. Light's Hammer is the top simcraft DPS talent on many fights, anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492889879781466112))<br />

Even Gladiator Warriors dislike Bonus Armor despite being touted as &quot;Best DPS Stat for Gladiator&quot; By Celestalon himself.<br />
Bonus Armor isn't competing with Strength. Strength doesn't give Armor. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493841162101202945))<br />
Stat priorities:PrimaryStats &gt; Spirit/BonusArmor &gt; AttunedSecondary &gt; OtherSecondariesSome flexibility to that, but rare. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493841367064276993))<br />

<br />
I dont get why the Claws of Shirvallah model has to use all fours. Makes more sense to stand upright but love it regardless.<br />

She is referring to Rukhmar and Sethe. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493190365168820224))<br />
Are Rukhmar and Anzu children of the Raven Mother?<br />
No, the Raven Mother is Anzu's consort - a demigod he left in charge of the ravens. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493190697064103937))<br />
<br />
So Terokk and Anzu were definitely presented as evil in tBC. Now they're painted in a much more positive light. So, what happened? Did they turn evil in those 30 years? Or are we missing something?<br />
Sorry if it's not totally clear! It's a story-heavy zone, and we are missing a few events to help explain things. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493455041676578816))<br />
They are both grappling with the curse and on the downward spiral. In BC Anzu is called back by the Sethekk. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493453953753817088))<br />
Terokk was pretty dark in his final days. Ultimately it's the player who sways the arakkoa away from evil in the WoD timeline. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493454385301553153))<br />

I know was investigating combat log working in all phases. Maybe he can comment. I deferred merging because of that.<br />
There are a number of technical issues still to work through; wouldn't count on it for 6.0, alas. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/492849243221024768))<br />

Why not work on both cities? Maybe patch Bladespire and Karabor later on to fortify our presence on Draenor?<br />
If we had infinite time might be a fun thing to return to in patches for sure. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493203013419667456))<br />
<br />
I'm also not a fan of how the Ashran hubs use 100% Garrison assets. It doesn't feel unique or fun. It feels forced and stale.<br />
Happy to report that lots of level design work still being done here! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493203166096539649))<br />
<br />
There is level 100 content in all the Draenor zones. We gotta portal to get back there. Boy, Ashran bases sure are near the fun.<br />
Your garrison is the centerpoint between all of these things, and is really your main &quot;hub,&quot; filled with many races/factions. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493196840179736576))<br />
I really don't get why &quot;Garrison 2&quot; is better than interaction between the garrison and the important location it is defending.<br />
Totally agree with you, needs to feel important to the world, lots of work still being done on this! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493202779922792448))<br />
You CAN'T make it important to the world. It's a second, public garrison. All it does is make YOUR garrison feel LESS important.<br />
Oh, you meant Ashran, I meant Garrisons in general (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493205776962699264))<br />
<br />
Uhh... I've seen Stormshield, and I've seen Karabor... You tell me which is more aesthetically pleasing.<br />
Karabor will have vendors, and you can go there and do w/e you want, it's not going anywhere. Not sure why the anger on this. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493170147830419456))<br />
I just think players are tired of the Orcs and Humans thing. It'd be really cool to see Kara/BSF actually being used by players.<br />
TBH If I had infinite time, I'd rather do a shared hub in Auchindoun or somewhere new/cool that has that Shatt/Dal vibe. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/493206198544789504))<br />

Yeah, every 21 days I make new belts. Some achievements can be crazy though with arbitrary big numbers [5000 pvp wins, 250 hks], this one will still take a bit at the start prolly. Start of MoP though I was pumping out 476 chests</div></div><hr />

It is pretty likely that these are just a few test monuments and there are more coming. I don't think the scarecrow is a final monument!<br />

Love the response to the Blood Elf models.<br />
<br />
It seems like they're simultaneously acknowledging that all of their work doing model updates will leave people bored quickly, and advertising that the blood elf update will be another big announcement in a patch. And if you read between the lines it just screams, &quot;It will look so cool in comparison to your now boring models that you will want to pay to change to this one!&quot;<br />

<br />
In the beta, the portal goes to Outland, when it goes live, It will get us to Tanaan starting quests, in the first few quests we close the portal on Draenor's end, so I guess it'll be inactive until Tanaan is available in 6.x or just lead to Outland.<br />
<br />
Still, the portals in capitals that used to transport you in front of the Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands, now gets you directly to Hellfire Peninsula, so I guess that if the Dark Portal doesn't lead to Outland, you'll still be able to go there with these portals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you read it? It is going to be implemented as an option, as blizz just stated.<br />
<br />
if it happens. IF. Blizzard made it explicitly clear that it is an &quot;IF&quot; and even IF it happens its only going to happen down the road.<br />
<br />
So in other words they ARE putting more importance on advancing what they have or putting more important in other things that are more relevant now before focusing on this</div></div><hr />

Great, we will be seeing rich hunters walk around in this set before my Shaman gets it. Been running Flexi now (15 or so runs), yet even after they annouced they forgot to add it into Flexi who months, they havent upped the drop chance, but are going to put this for people to buy? <br />
<br />
Meh<br />

No, we won't. To use something for transmogrifing, you must be able to equip it. The set is restricted to Shamans, so it won't be useable by Hunters. And just keep trying, I'm in the same situation, as many others.</div></div><hr />

Well not really,if you removed Orcs and Humans from the games the races would probably get along bar the forsaken most likely. All the other races are just doing as the Orcs and Humans tell them 2.</div></div><hr />

What people mean is that players are tired of JUST the orcs vs humans thing while forgetting there are other races for the main story line. Whenever they talk about the Horde vs Alliance war, it just ends up being humans and human themed buildings vs orcs and orc themed buildings along with the vast majority of coverage being orcs vs humans. While the other races basicly have cameo's, guest appearances and support roles, then bugger off.<br />
<br />
People just want more wholesome coverage for the main story line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razamith</div><div class="date">2014-08-04, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honest question here: People (bliz &amp; posters) keep saying you CAN visit party members' garrisons, but WILL they? Is there any purpose to? There's no incentive from customization since they're the same buildings/layout, and i doubt many would make a trip just to see some monuments or different race guards or slightly bigger town hall they'll eventually get too. Now if party members can help with a defend against attack event, or can use your crafters that they dont have buildings for, or anything actually co-op that's not &quot;ok yep this is another garrison meet you at the raid entrance&quot; i cannot recall anything announced/more than speculation yet.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately I did read the first tweet and the first tweet only. So, I apologize for my comment. - It's quite suprising that they actually thought of not to replace the actual models with upright ones, since they've pretty much ruined everything with Garrosh and Thrall. Yet, again, that's what sells.<br />
<br />
Thanks for correcting, tho.</div></div><hr />

Except, you're wrong. Hunches are not how it's always been. In Warcraft history, only peons had hunches. All of the Orc heroes stood upright and all of the peons stood hunched over, a byproduct of years of mandatory heavy labor. WoW is the only game in the Warcraft franchise that has hunched over orc heroes.</div></div><hr />

Point the phrase where I've clearly stated that Orcs in WarCraft have always been had hunches.</div></div><hr />

The information that possible optional things like straight standing Orcs is also great news! :D<br />
<br />
Yeah and I think I have probably ended up trashing all the ones I had. Not sure if they will be a different item or not tho. Might be WoD specific item</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a risky strategy though as this game is based off the whole Orcs Vs Humans storyline anyways,its like say Star Wars,if the movies veered off from the main plot and characters then probably no one would watch them. You gotta have a theme with stories and keep relatively close to them or else people tend to switch off and go do something else.</div></div><hr />
