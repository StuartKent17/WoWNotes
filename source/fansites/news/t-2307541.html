Netherlight Crucible Update<br />
Hey guys!<br />
<br />
We’ve been seeing a lot of discussion going back and forth on the Crucible lately, so we’ve had some conversations with the development team and I wanted to pop in and share a few points that came out of it.<br />
<br />
Regarding comparisons to Reforging – Reforging was always a simple, mechanical choice. Players were, at the end of the day, simply replacing their worst stats with best stats on every item that didn’t already have your best stats up to a mechanical limit. The Crucible, by comparison, is only affecting a small subset of items and presents much more varied situations than say “change 30 Hit Chance into Haste”.<br />
<br />
We’ve also seen a bit of discussion around players desiring the ability to respec the Traits that are locked on the second and third tiers of relics. We feel that the ability to respect Traits would lead to players picking traits based on perfect optimization for any given situation, which could lead to players leaving a raid to change to AoE-centric traits for the next fight during raid progression. While we feel that’s a nuisance in itself, this would also make the system feel like a watered-down version of talent rows, and would undermine the choice that is made when selecting your Relic Traits.<br />
<br />
That being said, Relics are items and will be replaced; we do expect players to make choices and experiment with this system. Since there is still new content ahead of us in Antorus, better Relics will be available and players who make choices they may not like now will have the opportunity to get new Relics before long with a potentially new set of Trait choices.<br />
<br />
As a note, we are also fine with the current state that Relics Soulbind on inspection in the Crucible. We believe the alternative of everyone porting in and out of the raid to pass the relic around and see who it’s best for is far, far worse. Players are smart and will be able to make educated decisions based on the information that’s available to them. As I said, we do expect experimentation however.<br />
<br />
A final note: I saw the post on Reddit laying out three choices for Relics, asking players which one they would pick -<br />
Relic A : 930 Ilvl BiS main trait, 3rd BiS bonus trait, but forces worst tier 2 crucible trait<br />
Relic B : 915 ilvl BiS main and bonus trait and 2nd BiS crucible tier 2 trait<br />
Relic C : 940 ilvl 2nd and 4th BiS traits and BiS crucible tier 2 trait.The poster responded by saying the only way to know is to sim it. If you’re generally a player who simulates gear upgrades to make decisions, you’re probably going to do that anyway, and that’s fine. If you’re a player going off basic guidelines such as “I play a fire mage so I want Critical Strike” you will get by as you always do in this situation and pick what you think is best for your particular class or spec. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback on the topic so far, I’ll be on the lookout for future discussions, as always.<br />
<br />
<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Legion Max Level Content Unlocked<br />
Legion allowed players to take their time leveling, delaying most of the max level content that people had previously rushed to level for until a few weeks after release. During this week, Normal and Heroic Emerald Nightmare unlocked, World Bosses started spawning, Mythic+ Dungeons opened, and the first PvP season started. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
BlizzCon 2015 In-Game Goodies Round-Up<br />
BlizzCon 2017 is rapidly approaching and we've already seen the new Horde and Alliance mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6986-BlizzCon-Virtual-Ticket-Stormwind-Skychaser-and-Orgrimmar-Interceptor-Mounts) that we will get this year. Looking back to 2015 we see the final in-game goodies roundup that included the incredibly cute and dangerous Murkidan, a Nexus Battle Beast Mount in Heroes, Hearthstone card back, Starcraft II Portraits, and a Pennant, Pet, and Portrait for Diablo III players. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor In-Game Cinematics<br />
During Warlords of Draenor Beta, Blizzard released all of the cinematics from the initial Warlords of Draenor campaign at once. This was done because the team was aware that some players enjoy spoilers and would seek out the cinematics on fansites. These included the iconic scene with Garrosh and Thrall, Yrel, Velen, the Warlords, and more. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria Zone Previews<br />
As more and more of Mists of Pandaria was being revealed, players finally got a chance to check out what some of the zones would look like. The previews included Krasarang Wilds, Dread Wastes, and Townlong Steppes. These offered some different environments and creatures than players had ever before scene, introducing the Klaxxi, Yaungol, and more Sha. Krasarang Wilds was a vibrant forest-like area teeming with all kinds of flora and fauna, Townlong Steppes housed the Shado-pan Garrison, and the Dread Wastes was an ashen and torn environment being overrun by Klaxxi.<br />

<br />
Appear Offline Coming &quot;Soon&quot;<br />
It may not seem like it, but it now has been five years since the Appear Offline &quot;Coming Soon&quot; notice was posted! Questions about the status of the feature is a favorite among BlizzCon Q&amp;A topics. In the years since, we got an update about adding Appear Offline to Overwatch in 2016 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6071-Upcoming-PvP-Balance-Changes-Appear-Offline-Blue-Tweets-DLC-558#appearOffline), another update in 2017 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6646-Glowcap-Festival-Tomb-of-Sargeras-Preview-Tweets-Overwatch-Offense-Hero-Secrets#appearOffline), and strings that refer to appearing offline were added to Hearthstone this year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6795-Appear-Offline-Mode-Strings-in-Hearthstone-ToS-Progression-Black-Temple-Timewalking). For now, the Appear Offline feature appears to still be coming &quot;Soon&quot; (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Soon). <br />

jup, yet again completely ignoring what players are experiencing. The cruscible system sucks donkey balls in it's current form. Take a wrong turn on the extra trait on a freshly high TF relic does not feel very nice at all.

Looking up the answer to everything doesnt feel good either. RNG is good, they should also make all their dmg equations less accessable aswell, making it more of a gut feeling and more rpg what stat you wanna go for. The more experienced person will make the better choices. And F all this &quot;competitive&quot; thing. Perfect balance is ruining the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't understand people's fascination with it... i have almost a full list, 75% are active in multiple games, and no one ever bothers me. If people have that clingy of friends maybe they need to re-evaluate their friendships and not wait for blizz to solve their problem for them.<br />
<br />
Plus, it would only make it easier for people stealing accounts, we've informed people earlier then they would have known that their account was compromised JUST because we could see it on when we knew they couldn't be.</div></div><hr />

If you have specific friends you need to hide from then maybe they shouldn't be on that list in the first place?</div></div><hr />

Then you should probably split with them.<br />
<br />
Not trying to be an ass but I have friends who spam me sometimes in WoW. I tell them I just want to be on my own tonight and they completely understand. They are sometimes miffed because they did want to play with me but if you have to actively hide from them then that's not what a friend is imo.</div></div><hr />

Yeah one guy on bnet I had was very persistent so I removed him, he was a guild officer. I tried to be nice, but it didn't work out in the long run. Of course I got kicked from the guild. Haha, but sometimes I just don't really wanna talk to anyone just do quests, so the feature itself is nice.</div></div><hr />

If you're online then you're available, that's how it is unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Yes I have. And even guildies have understood if I wanted to be alone. We had respect for others in our guild and if they were in a mood or wanted to be alone we would always say if they needed to talk we are here or at least try to find what the issue was. If they didn't want to talk about it and just chill then we were ok with that.<br />

I take it you don't have any co-workers on your btag list and never called in sick or played hooky.<br />
<br />
Nope. When I wanted time off work I would book it. My co-workers always know I've booked time off for a video game. If I call in sick then I am sick.<br />
<br />
The only time I book off as well is the amount I'm allowed.</div></div><hr />

The cruscible system sucks donkey balls in it's current form. Take a wrong turn on the extra trait on a freshly high TF relic does not feel very nice at all. They say it's not the same as reforging and that's incorrect, it's a simplified and worse system.<br />
<br />
Complaining about it doesn't help them fix it, constructive criticism and ideas will help.....and really I would rather have the RNG than have no new upgrades, at least they are trying something new and giving us a way to get an upgrade to our relics, they could have just done nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've had constructive criticism and more or less ignored it in favor of defending the current system.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;well we think relics binding on inspection is fine because the raid hearthing out would be annoying, it's the lesser of two evils!&quot; is either playing dumb to avoid having to deal with real criticism, or idiocy on such a level you shouldn't be designing a game when the obvious solution is for the relic traits to be visible ON the relic from the get-go without needing to hearth to the crucible.<br />
<br />
Likewise with &quot;We're worried players would constantly respec for the fight&quot;, how is that somehow worse than players potentially making a dreadful mistake by clicking the wrong talent that not only punishes them but also punishes their fellow raiders when they need to soak up another relic to replace their mistake - just slap an AP cost on the respec that makes doing so on a fight to fight basis too costly, but replacing a bad mistake possible if you put in your own time and effort re-grinding AP.<br />
<br />
I hate the developers feigned idiocy more than the crucible system itself, there's no way they're this blind to obvious alternative solutions after designing the game for so long and having over a decade of prior systems and how the playerbase has interacted with them to compare - instead of defending their current implementation vs obvious alternatives they seem to pick out silly strawmen implementations to attack instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That still leaves you with unwanted trade the relic to every player in the raid that can use it to see if they get their best in slot traits. <br />

<br />
Plus, it would only make it easier for people stealing accounts, we've informed people earlier then they would have known that their account was compromised JUST because we could see it on when we knew they couldn't be.<br />
<br />
some people want it, some people don't. Each having their own reasons for it so seeing how quite some people want it the option should at least be there for them instead of just forcing each and every one of them to re-evaluate their friendships. especially since the feature was promised to us years ago already but instead we get emoji :eek::eek::cool::p:mad::mad::(:(:o</div></div><hr />

Stalkers? Do you really think you are so important that you think people stalk you? HAHA<br />
<br />
Or you could just do it like steam which hides your friends list when you are appearing offline, or just remove the completely fabricated &quot;stalkers&quot; from your friendslist. TBH the only people against said features are the people most of us want to hide from.<br />

Must be shitty you need to lie and hide from your friends, if you have any that is, sounds pretty terrible.<br />

You realize that you're probably one of those people we want to hide from if you don't understand the issue, right?<br />
<br />
Sometimes you have people who you like on your friends list but they don't exactly understand boundaries and that I might want to just do some pet battles or dailies without being asked to do things.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hellshout</div><div class="date">2017-09-23, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a note, we are also fine with the current state that Relics Soulbind on inspection in the Crucible. We believe the alternative of everyone porting in and out of the raid to pass the relic around and see who it’s best for is far, far worse. <br />
<br />
For who? Cause sure as shit ain't far far worse for the players. Especially the ones that might farm a certain item for a while now and if there are 2 of them for the same relic why not boost the raid as a whole when you can gamble the item and if it sucks for that player, well they have until WoW is finished to get that item again, right?<br />
At least don't give us bullshit about it and call it by the name: &quot;we don't want you just trade items like crazy, we want you to work for them&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
change to AoE-centric traits for the next fight during raid progression. While we feel that’s a nuisance in itself,<br />
<br />
i agree with the fact that it will dumb down the crucible, but saying changing talents/specs/items/traits is a nuisance in a raid progression is so freaking stupid. ALL of the competitive players try to squeeze as much dps as possible for the progression and you say it's annoying for the raid? Either the spokes person is a retard(in a derogatory way, not the actual condition, calm down 2017) or Blizz's shit smells like roses sprayed with some Chanel no5 and they can't see outside their asses.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meroko</div><div class="date">2017-09-23, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't get the upheaval about the Crucible. It's a fine system, and in fact I think people just hate RNG in general which begs the question, why are you playing an RPG game? That's literally the pinnacle of RPG's. RNG = replay value, if the game gave you everything you wanted right away, you'd be done in one week. I'm actually glad they stand by their guns on this one because for me personally it has kept me playing the game. If it has turned you away from the game, then it's not the right game for you. Move on to something new.</div></div><hr />

I get tired of saying no every day to them without wanting to removed them from my friendslist and completely burn a bridge.<br />
<br />
In other words, you'd probably appear offline at all times except for when you either have an actual reason to say no (&quot;sorry, raid time right now&quot;) or when you yourself are the one looking for bodies to fill a group. Just guessing here, though.<br />
<br />
For my part, my friend list currently has 5 people on it because I only keep people who I talk to beyond the day I add them to my list. Judge that decision how you want, but my opinion is that anyone who's looking forward to this feature has a problem they've had apparently 5 years to address rather than waiting for Blizzard to do it for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd not use the feature most of the time to be honest, so you're wrong right from the start. Sometimes I log in just do do some dailies etc and don't want to have to talk to anyone at all. Don't &quot;guess&quot; it's not conducive to a productive conversation.<br />
<br />
<br />
but my opinion is that anyone who's looking forward to this feature has a problem they've had apparently 5 years to address rather than waiting for Blizzard to do it for them. There is nothing I can do that would mimic that feature, removing everyone from my list isn't a measured response, it's a scorched earth response it's unreasonable and would likely burn bridges between those people and myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, most other platforms have such a feature and it makes no sense to not want it. If you wouldn't use it, why do you care if it exists? Just don't use it and let me use it, why are you against something like that for any reason other than being a contrarian?</div></div><hr />

You guys are so quick to be flippant. It's not a huge problem, but stalking does happen, I witnessed it. And, as a raid leader/officer, we had to have alts that weren't in the guild and secret, so we weren't bombarded constantly with whispers about stupid shit. Or some days, you just wanna farm ore and be left alone.<br />
<br />
But you Judgey Mcjudgersons can see a person's entire life and accuse them of horrible things, because...reasons? It's like that scene in Good Will Hunting, when Will judge's Robin Williams entire life over a painting. You guys deserve the same response: <br />
<br />
Sean: [sitting on a bench in in front of a pond in park] Thought about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. Stayed up half the night thinking about it. Something occurred to me... fell into a deep peaceful sleep, and haven't thought about you since. Do you know what occurred to me?<br />
Will: No.<br />
Sean: You're just a kid, you don't have the faintest idea what you're talkin' about.<br />
Will: Why thank you.<br />
Sean: It's all right. You've never been out of Boston.<br />
Will: Nope.<br />
Sean: So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. Michelangelo, you know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works, right? But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling; seen that. If I ask you about women, you'd probably give me a syllabus about your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You're a tough kid. And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right, &quot;once more unto the breach dear friends.&quot; But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you. Who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in the hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes, that the terms &quot;visiting hours&quot; don't apply to you. You don't know about real loss, 'cause it only occurs when you've loved something more than you love yourself. And I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much. And look at you... I don't see an intelligent, confident man... I see a cocky, scared shitless kid. But you're a genius Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you. But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine, and you ripped my fucking life apart.<br />

I'll sleep really well tonight, and never think of you again. :) But you keep attacking other posters. Your life must be incredibly miserable for you to lash out over something as simple as this. You may want to consider therapy.</div></div><hr />

It's easy to throw out petty insults when you are strawmanning. <br />
<br />
Like me any many other people have said, I wouldn't even heavily use the feature, but if I just want to pop on and do a few dailies and not have to talk to people it would be nice. It's unfathomable that you've never not wanted to talk to people. <br />
<br />
Again, you don't have to use the feature, and other people using the feature doesn't affect you in any way. Realistically the only reason someone would disagree with such a feature is because they are one of the people who incessantly pesters people to play with them. You literally are the person everyone regrets adding to their friends list, you're literally the reason people want this feature, it's understandable why you and other people who can't take no for an answer don't want this feature. No one would play with you anymore if it existed.</div></div><hr />

Again, you don't have to use the feature, and other people using the feature doesn't affect you in any way. Realistically the only reason someone would disagree with such a feature is because they are one of the people who incessantly pesters people to play with them. You literally are the person everyone regrets adding to their friends list, you're literally the reason people want this feature, it's understandable why you and other people who can't take no for an answer don't want this feature. No one would play with you anymore if it existed.<br />
<br />
Wow the mental gymnastics this guy went through to somehow turn a situation favorable to him and then suddenly fail dramatically in the conclusion not even addressing the point in the comment is pretty pathetic.<br />
<br />
No wonder why people don't want to play WOW, they have to pay a premium service to put up with people of the likes to you, in both on the forums and in this game.</div></div><hr />

Has it occurred to none of you that this may have been a popular feature request, and that any modern/contemporary chat client supports emoji? The only big surprise (but not, considering the developer) is that it took Blizzard this long to add them.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually trying really hard to think of an expansion filled with more design choices outside of the player's control and I can't think of one. Which one were you thinking?</div></div><hr />

The first month or two I thought it was pretty good, but the more you play it the more you see all the flaws and it just makes me not wanting to play. I could go through what's good and what's bad in the expansion but most people are already aware of everything, it's all on the wow forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what do you want the Battle.net team to design for the Battle.net app specifically?<br />
<br />
Or are you under the illusion that the WoW or Overwatch team did this?<br />
<br />
I don't like emojis either but this probably took the efforts of 1 person.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, who asked for emojis in bnet? Who benefits from it?<br />
<br />
I see that they have focused on this instead of the planned &quot;soon&quot; appear offline feature :(<br />

Hmm.. Well, that explains why we have waited years and years for a &quot;appear offline&quot; feature added to the thing. Yet to blizzard , they keep saying soon to be added.... Battle net team VERY busy with something else maybe? oh, Emoticons ! That's what most people were asking for! Game changing stuff</div></div><hr />

Well Battle.net isn't a game. It's an application for accessing the games :). Appear offline isn't exactly a riveting addition either.<br />
<br />
And as I said this was probably done by 1 person in their spare time.</div></div><hr />

Well it is for a few people.. If they have them added on WoW, via Bnet, Xserver, and they want to just log on and have a break from people possibly asking constantly &quot;do u wana do something? can u come help out in a raid, can u do this&quot; that and the other :) It helps out quite abit, even if they wanted to enjoy a different game without &quot;get on wow lets do something&quot; or &quot;help out the guild please as your online.&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Alot of people want the offline feature :P not emoticons haha.<br />
<br />
Especially when we can LITERALLY put &quot;:), :D, :P, xD&quot; list goes on, it's not exactly like we missed a 'feature'.<br />
<br />
edit- I can't even get away from it in the MMOChamp threads, a normaly smiley face written with a keyboard auto turns it into one, Ugh :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. The Appear Offline feature which was promised five years ago. There are no options for hiding your online status to Battle.net friends and the only workaround is to block a port on your router which completely disables communication functionality between friends. Since you can already change your status to Busy or Away, this surely can't be too hard to implement?<br />
<br />
2. Rolling out Blizzard Voice for more games and not just Overwatch. This isn't really a dealbreaker because Discord, Teamspeak, Raidcall, Ventrilo, Mumble, Skype and the Twitch client already exist as voice chat solutions. Something official integrated into each Battle.net game would be great though, especially after the barely functional mess that WoW players got a decade ago.<br />
<br />
3. Support for classic Blizzard games in the client. The only classic Blizzard game to be supported in the launcher is StarCraft and that's the premium Remastered version. It's a bummer that we can't download, install and launch WarCraft II, WarCraft III, Diablo or Diablo II, or the other titles Blizzard released from the launcher.<br />
<br />
4. More Activision games? Destiny 2's inclusion shows this isn't outside the realm of possibility.<br />
<br />
5. Bug and optimisation fixes? I actually have the Battle.net desktop client close whenever I launch a game because having it open causes conflicts with my graphics drivers which makes them freeze and restart.</div></div><hr />

1. Fair play. They have said this is on the back burner for god knows how long now. Personally I won't use it but I imagine there are people who would.<br />
<br />
2. People really use that?! I figured with Discord people would just flock to that since it's free.<br />
<br />
3. Probably takes a lot more work than you imagine. Which is why they are doing remastered versions. Diablo 1 used a really barebones form of Battle.net to be fair back then. The problem with the older games is that it doesn't use the same Battle.net structure that the modern games do either. <br />
<br />
Warcraft 3 assets do exist in the app but it's just background borders. So it's either going to be a remaster or they might be able to port it since that one used a really advanced form of Battle.net with lobby features, matchmaking and custom games. But I imagine for the sake of money it will get remastered.<br />
<br />
4. Destiny 2 is only published by them. I imagine in the future though Activision will want their games on it. Will be amusing watching people throw a temper tantrum over it and how it ruins the integrity of Battle.net :)<br />
<br />
5. Can't say I experience these bugs however I have heard of people reporting them so again fair play.</div></div><hr />
