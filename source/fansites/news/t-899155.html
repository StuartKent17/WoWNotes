It's already out in the US - check your version number. Mine is 14007 now, which is newer than the PTR build.<br />
<br />
I also had to recheck &quot;load out of date addons&quot; because the patch apparently reset that toggle.</div></div><hr />

Anytime the version of the live client is changed you have to recheck that box if you want to use addon's that aren't updated yet. Because every time the client changes addon's have to change their TOC file to reflect they are built for the current version.</div></div><hr />

I 2nd the mage thank you. Also as a raider, thx for making Heroic Magmaw killable again. Fortunately this was a break week for our guild since most of the raid had finals, but other guilds on the server were not so lucky.</div></div><hr />

The advantage of the US getting patches first is that if something breaks horribly, which is pretty often then they will get the aftermath first and we will at least be aware of it usually before we are affected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you should check all your addons, as far as I can tell any &quot;DC issues&quot; that were there before, like zoning after a wipe and not everyone was dead yet, is fixed. Too many people blame Blizzard for things that they, themselves are directly or indirectly the cause of. There is even a threads on the official WoW forums where people bitch about getting DC'd and lagging but when asked if they actually turned off the network optimization, they answer no.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brakkis</div><div class="date">2011-05-05, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't had a single add-on turned on since 4.1 (Bartender and Xperl are both having issues that I just don't want to deal with, got tired of Recount being a Memory hog, and Omen...well, if I pull threat these days, the tank is bad)<br />
<br />
Not everything is fixed by simply removing your WTF/Interface/Cache Folders. The Currency window issue for instance, has nothing at all to do with add-ons. Neither does the zone change DC. The lag and subsequent DC issues in Raids/BG's is add-on related though.</div></div><hr />
