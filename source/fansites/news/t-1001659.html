Description from Youtube (Spoilers)<br />
Blizzard decided not to open this fight to testing because the jumping from platform to platform was extremely buggy, as you'll see at the end of the video. Basically what you have to do is kill the appendage that's on each platform after killing a big tentacle. Each aspect has their own platform, and when you destroy the appendage on that aspect's platform, you lose the buff they give you. This makes the fight harder as you destroy each platform. <br />
<br />
Due to the bugs with jumping, we were forced to destroy the best platforms first, which made the fight harder (though it's still incredibly undertuned). Once we finally cleared all 4 platforms, deathwing slams his head on the middle platform with only 10 mil health, you get all the buffs back, and I assume it's just supposed to be like the last 10% of the Lich King, as it would have been a ridiculously easy burn if we could get over there.<br />

Patch 4.3: Fangs of the Father<br />
Killars from vodka (www.vodka-guild.net) spent some of his free time on test realms going through the legendary quest and came back with a few fun pictures! The stats for the first epic version of the daggers are now known, and it also seems that you will need to spend 10,000 gold at some point during the questline. <br />

People who get the stream only get the loot card, nothing else extra (I believe the BlizzCon Store is actually opened to people who bought the stream, but you need to spend extra money).</div></div><hr />

The Exclusive starcraft 2 pet is a Panda. Look closely... or more like look a bit far away for a clearer image :) Well that pretty much confirms it, Pandas are in 1 day.<br />

Seems legit. Kinda. But yeah it kinda does resemble a panda. <br />
The big question remains what this means, IF its a panda. Will they become playable?</div></div><hr />

I don't know what's worth complaining about. It's a guild effort so just get the guild to pitch in. Shouldn't be that hard to collect that amount of money and it's definitively a nice twist.</div></div><hr />

The final phase ( or what seems like it) wasn't reachable so you don't know whats going to happen at that point when you actually get over the ledge to his head. Also from our experience with Rag Heroic, it seems very likely that a new phase will occur after the head that brings him out of the mealstrom.</div></div><hr />

Yep, he seems pretty passive in that fight, hoping they will do the same thing with MoD HC with the way they've dealt with Ragnaros HC, that'd epic, rather than his head collapsing on the platform, we'd get to see Avatar of N'zoth appear and empower him, or even better, Azshara bringing a gift from their master, getting Deathwing into shape and paralyzing the Aspects in the meanwhile, where only heroes and Thrall get to down the huge monstrosity...</div></div><hr />

Where exactly are you getting these criteria for legendarys from? As of now the staff is a joke to get and it should be a lot harder considering it's a legendary, I hope the daggers are a lot harder to get so everyone is running around with them like the staff.</div></div><hr />

Its my own common sense. Lol, I don't have to &quot;get it from somewhere&quot;. People who end up going for legendaries do it as a group, with their raid. Its supposed to take a while, its supposed to be OP when you get it, and your supposed to feel extremely accomplished when you do so. How does spending 10k make it feel epic in any way shape form or fashion. by that logic i should feel like a special snowflake for buying an overprieced BoE on the AH. My personal view, disagree all you want. Like I said, You raid for it, you farm for it.. you do not buy it for gold or else it feel like a vendor item and much less &quot;legendary&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like 10k is hard to make now. The Molten Front and Deepholm dailies give something like 400g a day, and any Rogue who can't do them in under 40 minutes won't be getting these daggers anyway. <br />
<br />
For that matter, any semi-serious raiding guild has so much cash these days that they'll probably just give the recipient the money. My guild pays for all repairs on raid nights and we still come out 2k a week ahead just from Cash Flow.</div></div><hr />

It's looks easier than the three end bosses from the start of this expansion, for goodness sake. Sure, there's a difference between it 'looking' easy and it 'being' easy, and it's already been said that the fight is way undertuned, but this doesn't look like it took any imagination at all. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but nothing creative is coming out of WoW anymore. I'm not saying ZOMG END OF WOW, WoW will 'die' whenever enough people leave it, which is nowhere near that time yet, sadly. All I'm saying is that this expansion lacks more and more imagination the further it goes on. I really, really miss TBC... Heck, I even miss WotLK sometimes. <br />

I'm not surprised people quit this game everyday. I quit a few weeks ago and have yet to regret that decision. Moving on to fresh and new MMOs looks like the way forward for those having played this game 5+ years already.</div></div><hr />

Raids are short with few trash to clear (BWD,TOTW...) Plz blizzard get back to old wow. With raids like BT,MC,Kara etc or this game will die ppl are already to bored of it. And 4.3 well its not chalenging at all. Boss are to easy and by the look of it nowadays all mechanics that can wipe raid gief player like to much time to reach. I rly miss smt like Defile.

First the ingame currency is gold, but I guess that was what you meant.<br />

And secondly, the people in the first phase of the legendary staff had to pay 3 sands of time (3K gold each, or 2.4k when you have the appropriate reputation) for the staff.<br />

Indeed. At least on my server I had to pay ~2,5k per Primordial, ended up costing me around 50k to get mourne, and not once did I whine about it. So I really can't understand people whining about a measly 10k.</div></div><hr />

It was worth over 30k maybe if you sold/bought them on AH, but you could buy them with emblems too and if I am correct, they also dropped from bosses occasionally.<br />
So yes, you could choose to just buy the things from AH, but you could also do guild effort in buying them through the quartermaster, for a lot less.</div></div><hr />

Um, gold become trivial about a month into WotLK. Also, any decent progression guild would have been giving all the Primordials to whoever was getting Skillmourne first, on top of that the guild would most likely use G-Bank funds to pay for the mats, just like will guilds will do for this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
9k plus 33g to respec to 31/10/0 affliction, plus 500 or so gold to cover 4 hours of wiping to that freaking boss in the &quot;Through a Glass Darkly<br />

<br />
Where have you been? people have paid tons of gold, more then just a small sum of only 10k gold to get legendaries started up.<br />
<br />
I remember my friend must've spent 50k gold on the starter version of shadowmourne, and there was loads of materials invested into thunderfury and rags mace.<br />
<br />
and now that we are in cata, 10k gold is almost nothing, you can sell items at certain points for 10k, you can craft an item and sell it for 10k, you can farm ore for a day and get 10k, that is not a big deal at all.</div></div><hr />

Tuning in basic form is all about, number of adds, hp, damage. Mostly in this case. Buggy meaning it has bugs and errors, mechanics are not working right, but when you talk about the actual fight, it is the actual fight, that is the model that they have worked on for a while, this is there concept, the concept and the model could change, but when you talk about tuning and bugs, that really doesn't deal much with the concept and model of the fight.</div></div><hr />

But even all of that is still speculation until it is in its final form. Reserve your judgement for when the boss is on live. The encounter is missing a lot of the things that are found in the dungeon journal.</div></div><hr />

If it is a pandaren it could mean that they are going to feature pandaren in wow, either as NPC's, playable characters, or MoP. They wouldn't announce it because that would prove they are doing something with pandaren. And people think it's related to wow because a few starcraft 2 portraits have been wow related (like the murloc).</div></div><hr />

A) If you don't like it then don't pay. You live in America, no one's forcing you to pay, you live in a capitalistic society.<br />

<br />
No one said you had to pay 30k for your primordial saronite, I guess you were unaware those could be bought via emblems and drop from bosses did you? and you call me the idiot? since most people seem to think my only reaction is &quot;wahh i dont have money&quot; i had like 65k just before i quit wow. money is not the problem for me. its the principle of it costing extra money ontop of time spent, repair costs etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhhhh, seriously?<br />
<br />
You're fighting the aspect of death. After ripping his body apart, he crashes into a giant swirling portal of water and arcane energy. Literally falling apart from the inside, he emerges and lashes out at you with molten tentacles that have spawned from his madness and corruption. Meanwhile, 4 dragon-gods fly around and help you. That' sounds pretty epic to me<br />
<br />
GW2: Oh, look, a dragon flew out of the ocean. Kill adds. Oh cool I can shoot it with a cannon too.<br />
<br />
Based on pure asthetics, obviously the GW2 fights are better, but there's something to be said about the lore building in WoW, and the reason it has such a built in leg up on new MMOs. People have opinions, yours aren't always right. GTF over it.</div></div><hr />

In other words, I'm not even really trying to make gold, hell I don't have to try. Blizzard practically throws gold at you at every turn in the game now so 10k is a pittance. Also, 8-9k for Sands of Time for legendary staff, 25 Primordial Saronites that most people were too impatient to wait to drop or buy with emblems because gold was pretty easy to obtain during WotlK too, and as others have mentioned mats for Thunderfury and Sulfuras.</div></div><hr />

You're fighting the aspect of death. After ripping his body apart, he crashes into a giant swirling portal of water and arcane energy. Literally falling apart from the inside, he emerges and lashes out at you with molten tentacles that have spawned from his madness and corruption. Meanwhile, 4 dragon-gods fly around and help you. That' sounds pretty epic to me<br />
<br />
GW2: Oh, look, a dragon flew out of the ocean. Kill adds. Oh cool I can shoot it with a cannon too.<br />
<br />
Based on pure asthetics, obviously the GW2 fights are better, but there's something to be said about the lore building in WoW, and the reason it has such a built in leg up on new MMOs. People have opinions, yours aren't always right. GTF over it.<br />
<br />
Deathwing appears in the cinematic, burns random players in leveling zones for a few months, then players fight adds in two locations and he's gone. How is THAT lore-building?<br />
<br />
The delivery is also terrible. Those dragon-gods don't participate directly, just sit back out of view and provide buffs. And the Deathwing fights are players versus random adds from one rocky location (with flapping wings as a backdrop) to another location (with the Mael as a background) - you may as well just be fighting annoying trash packs in a random dungeon, because you're certainly not fighting Deathwing.<br />
<br />
That was my whole point. They COULD have done something interesting and finally built up some kind of lore or meaningful fight, but instead it's &quot;kill adds and DW goes boom.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm actually not foaming at the mouth to try this... Spine looks pretty cool, but this is a little meh if this is exactly how its going to appear live (which hopefully it isn't).<br />
<br />
For one, seeing gadgetzan burnt to the f'ing ground the first time WAS pretty cool. <br />
<br />
Secondly, DW originally appeared in the Warcraft RTS games, and the novels (which I haven't really read many of actually). Also, he shows up a number of times in the 1-60 new leveling experience, and the 80-85 leveling experience. He's the father of onyxia and nefarian, who have been having setbacks for years. And he was the corrupted by the old gods, who are some of the most mysterious creatures, and (in my opinion) coolest fights/villains in WoW. <br />
<br />
So i think it's wrong to say there is no lore.<br />
<br />
I'm much more interested in Helping Alexstrasza the dragon queen and Thrall the shaman slay the former dragon aspect Deathwing, than helping Alkoron the wyrm lord and Morg the mystic stay the dragon Doomclaw.<br />
<br />
It that biased? well yeah obviously. But warcraft has always felt more fun due to the familiarity. Which is why I do intend to try ToR, actually. Meh, I'm sure I'll try GW2 also.</div></div><hr />

I actually won't be trying out either one. I just find it difficult to believe that people can look at some incredible examples of mechanics/gameplay from other games and convince themselves that it's terrible, while at the same time blatantly underwhelming previews of fights in WoW result in nerdgasms.<br />
<br />
I understand how lore can add to fun, but though Deathwing had mentions in books and games which - while I enjoyed - are more than a decade old, he hasn't really been fleshed out in *World of Warcraft* much at all. Arthas was already well-known, yet WoW added incredible depth to this character via dozens of Icecrown quests, ICC heroics, and the fights within ICC itself.<br />
<br />
Deathwing was obscure, yet he hasn't been given any attention whatsoever. His entire storyline:<br />
<br />
&quot;Deathwing was sitting around one day when an old god made him go crazy somehow. Crazy dragon been acting crazy, yo - just burning random things. Why those random things? HE CRAZY, dat's why! A bunch of players best go jump on his back and slap his tentacles til he dies.&quot; The end. That's it. Blah.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rockdontroll</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so the final fight is with deathwing's arms and wings on platforms of rock? I can see the madness indeed.... at least we physically killed lich king last expansion...<br />
<br />
here's for hoping this is all a big joke at blizzard and actually there is another final fight against deathwing</div></div><hr />

Did you unsub yet?<br />
I think the fight will be epic. And now ur local newbs can see it too via LFR.<br />
<br />
People always qq and moan and say they will stop but yet 1 out of 100 actually does that.<br />
<br />
10k gold? What's that nowadays? People qq about stupid stuff. I should stop reading comments. It's really depressing.</div></div><hr />

Ideally, it would cost 500k gold, and the only quest would be to catch the tears of the 99% with my shiny legendaries.</div></div><hr />

There's more to Deathwing's story in just the Cataclysm introductory cinematic than your oh-so-not-funny comment makes out is in the whole game. Come back when you know something about the lore, hey?</div></div><hr />

No, he pretty much nailed it, IN-GAME lore, that's pretty much it, &quot;Hi I'm deathwing, I burned your zones&quot;.</div></div><hr />
