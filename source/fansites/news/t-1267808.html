Patch 5.2 - Isle of Thunder Rare Spawns<br />
We already talked about (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3081-New-5-2-Rare-Spawns-5-1-Hotfixes-5-2-Set-Bonus-Issues-5-2-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts) the new rare spawns that drop some of the Direhorn mounts, so let's take a look at the new rare spawns on the Isle of Thunder. Thanks to Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca) for helping to gather much of this information. You will need to kill these ten NPCs to earn the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/581/280/16/16/inv-shield-mogu-c-01.jpg Champions of Lei Shen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8103-champions-of-lei-shen) achievement. <br />

Ra'sha (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70530-rasha) is the eleventh rare spawn. He is somewhat weaker than the others, not an elite, and drops Ra'sha's Sacrificial Dagger (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/95566-rashas-sacrificial-dagger).<br />
<br />
The rest of the rare spawns have a chance to drop a Key to the Palace of Lei Shen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen) and Shan'ze Ritual Stone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94221-shanze-ritual-stone).

You can find a description of the encounter on the NPC pages. <br />

<br />
Patch 5.2 - Quest / Rare NPC Sharing<br />
One of the complaints that often came up in the Blue Tweets was people &quot;stealing&quot; mobs during daily quests or when killing a rare spawn. Patch 5.2 attempts to make things a little bit better with a new system that lets you share mobs. Currently, any mob that is flagged as a quest mob on live gives you credit when you participate in the kill, but Patch 5.2 takes this one step further. <br />
<br />
When you encounter another player killing a rare spawn or quest flagged NPC, you can just start to help them kill it. Doing so will increase the maximum health of the NPC by 50% and give you a chance to win loot, completely separate from the other player. If someone else comes along to help out, this will increase the health by another 50%, and give them a chance to win loot as well. You will still get loot with just one hit while the mob is alive, even if combat drops. <br />
<br />
This system allows anyone from either faction, in your group, solo, or in another group to take part in killing these NPCs and get a chance at the loot, without affecting your loot chances. For now, it only works for the new rares and big quest mobs introduced in Patch 5.2. Please note that this does not work for normal quest mobs (Kill 20 of X...), only the bigger ones that are usually named and have an icon on their unit frame. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
My point is that you have never been able to balance classes in the past, this makes it even harder.<br />
But players want their guy to be the highest DPS so they don't have to switch. Not sure how to solve that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301066066849849344))<br />
I think it's impossible to balance say Fire, Frost and Arcane to be identical on every single boss. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301065886364749824))<br />
<br />
Positive feedback on what basis? Because on the PTR the seal hasn't been working correctly at all.<br />
While actual testing is the most valuable, I'd say we get 75% of our feedback just from player reaction and theorycrafting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301551845007036416))<br />

Survival Hunters - Black Arrow shares a cooldown with Explosive TRAP. Working as intended, but why? This baffles me.<br />
We don't want you to have to drop a trap as part of a single target rotation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300330447290904576))<br />
<br />
Are you nerfing Silencing Shot because noone uses Wyvern Sting and Binding Shot? I think a better answer is SS as baseline! <br />
Silencing Shot is really powerful and the short CD just felt like too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300330176066240512))<br />
<br />
Why can BM hunters Use Stampede in arena, And Dks cant use Army of the dead, It would be fun for Unholy to have this in arena.<br />
There is a teensy bit of damage potential between the two. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302530152481566720))<br />

why nerf arcane into the ground instead of buffing frost with a small arcane nerf?<br />
Because Arcane is ahead of everyone else (along with Affliction). We'd have to buff everyone else (including the bosses). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301073575736115202))<br />

MWs wont stop Jab Jab Uplift, we'll just get more spirit to compensate. Possibly make t30 talents gen 1 Chi (2 for Chi Burst)?<br />
You don't have to stop. Just don't be sad when your mana down. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302523202771484672))<br />

would you consider the possibility of efficiently leveling as a Holy paladin (or ranged dps paladin new spec)?<br />
Have you tried it in MoP? Ranged Judgment with Holy Shock and Denounce works pretty well for DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301073393388756992))<br />
<br />
GC, most Rets today are crying for sustained damage and not burst. Please re-evaluate this outdated assumption.<br />
Go look at my Twitter feed a month or two ago. I speculated we could nerf Ret CDs and buff sustained. The earth trembled. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301072914554445825))<br />
<br />
You know, youre giving WW an obscene buff in utility all around yet you give ret some small gimmick buffs. We need massive aid<br />
There are like 5x as many Ret paladins as all monks put together. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301079017350631425))<br />
<br />
Could you explain why you won't change Devotion Aura to also include Phys damage 5.2? At least for Holy Paladins.<br />
We don't want every CD to be a carbon copy. Mantid just happened to have a lot of physical AE. Not the case for every boss. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300329242498039809))<br />

The 20% mindblast increase is a promising first tweak for shadow priests. Any chance mb haste scaling from ptr will come back?<br />
Explain why your DPS needs it. What percent of relative DPS will you lose in the course of 5.2 because of scaling? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301077576892428288))<br />
<br />
instead of buffing mind blast damage, why not scale the cd with haste? Would help stat scaling a bit.<br />
Will your relative DPS drop 10% over the course of a tier because of haste scaling? If not, why does it matter? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/300332397747118080))<br />
<br />
When are you going to stop focusing on disc all the time and pay some MUCH needed attention on holy? (PvE)<br />
We think Holy is in a really good place. They just get overshadowed by Disc so their representation is low. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301076727172579328))<br />
<br />
And you still lose 25% output in the stance you're not in while no others healers have to deal with this. Why?<br />
Chakra is the Holy priest resource. You could ask why Holy paladins need to build up Holy Power before using WoG or EF. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301033694360133632))<br />
chakra is a resource alright, a resource for frustration, and will to bump my head in the wall.<br />
Holy without Chakra is just a generic healer, a Molten Core priest. If you don't like Chakra, probably not a good spec for you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301566803723825154))<br />
I know you've talked about doing that before, and it really is the only way to make Chakra actually fun.<br />
We agree it would be more fun with more different spells per stance. Making swapping super easy just makes swapping not a thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301574486254288896))<br />
<br />
Let me ask you this, do you think Sanctuary, in its current state, is a good spell?<br />
A good spell, yes. A high HPS spell, no, and it wasn't intended to be. You can layer it with other heals though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301566165392699392))<br />
<br />
so disc priest wont crit anymore but get a bubble instead... why are you nerfing priest so much? Being oom constantly sucks.<br />
Your crits will &quot;only&quot; be 130% but now non crits will be 130% too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866223715192833))<br />
<br />
will pws critting simply mean pws absorb is 2x or does it create da for 100% when crits? For pvp I hope it creates da.<br />
PW:S crit is just a double absorb. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302523444216602624))<br />

Does the t15 4pc 7 second gcd stack with the glyph of Adrenaline rush?<br />
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302186067661037568))<br />
<br />
how many patches will the devs ask and wonder why rogues pop isnt high enough when we have been telling you for months energy<br />
Not a recent phenomenon. My pet theory is rogue pop started to drop as soon as gank -&gt; guaranteed kill became less likely. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302861406636740608))<br />
<br />
regen is TOO low, therefor the class is SLOW and UNFUN, want to bring your rogue players back up? Increase the sodding regen!<br />
Our vision for rogues is not to have enough energy to fill every GCD. That makes energy not a thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302860906914783232))<br />

Any chance at destro locks seeing the cataclysm spell thay we read about? survival is tough without blood fear. thankyou.<br />

Why should warriors be &quot;forced&quot; to stay in Battlestance?<br />
Mostly because that's our design intent. You can go Defensive or Berserk for short situational reasons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302187568953430017))<br />
<br />
hate to pester but could you hit me with some insight?<br />
Shield Barrier was just a little too good with high Vengeance. I don't think you'll notice much of a change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301862981296349184))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Hey , i was wondering if the gear without a drop source on the new raid are trash loots or arent going to be implemented ?<br />
Normal drops trash loot (and there is no heroic trash). In LFR, you can get those pieces (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-difficulty-type=4&amp;filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-set=0&amp;filter-ilvl-max=540) from the bags that only have gold today.

Ra-den Limited attempts? Seriously? I am disappoint, #LevelALLTheAlts!<br />
At some point, cutting-edge guilds making 500 attempts a week is no longer a test of skill. It's a test of endurance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302864096502620160))<br />
<br />
And that's not my standard. That's standard.<br />
The intent of Ra-Den is to be insanely difficult. Most heroic guilds should not consider him a part of progression. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302869329383407617))<br />
<br />
thunderforged increases logistics problem for 25. It makes things worse. If this is the only solution this expansion...<br />
Remember, the main goal of Thunderforged is to keep Jin'rokh kills interesting after 12 weeks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302868209030279168))<br />
<br />
I could see that if the 5.0 raids were en masse on farm, but they aren't. Most raiders haven't cleared Terrace.<br />
Most raiders have, because they play LFR, and they're ready for something new. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302531806937374722))<br />
How many % of players raid lfr, and how many % of players raid hardmodes? Have you got any current numbers?<br />
I do, but it's probably not appropriate to share them. A whole lot of people do LFR. Very few do heroic raids. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866777677901824))<br />
That should not be interpreted as developing heroic raids is a waste of resources. We don't agree with that conclusion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302866901745426432))<br />
<br />
What is &quot;the Mechanar Syndrome&quot;? I've noticed you have mentioned it several times.<br />

You mean like dailies? Perfect example whether intended or not.<br />
Mmm, not really. A better example would be if Klaxxi offered more valor than Golden Lotus so everyone just ran Klaxxi. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/302201259065237506))<br />
<br />
do you take those metrics into account when tunning drop chances? Just curious, not complaining.<br />
No, we're worried that would cause a vicious cycle. We drop gear by number of potential users, not current class popularity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301816453680742400))<br />
<br />
this is crude and simple but true. current progression: LFR-----------Normal---Heroics. should be: LFR----Normal-----Heroics<br />
Some of the normals had berserk timers that were a little tight. If you beat the mechanics you should probably win N (but not H). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301563386951520256))<br />
<br />
Challenge Mode dungeons are great fun! How do you feel their acceptance is? Above or below expectation? Or on par?<br />
I think we will see more players do them as they run out of other content to do. We always knew their niche would never be huge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301562407799627776))<br />

For the purposes of RPPM, do the Haste buffs (Melee / Spell) contribute to the proc rate?<br />

Will that feature apply to all rares in Azeroth/Outland/Northrend/Pandaria?<br />
Because if it does, how would it apply to TLPD/Aeonaxx/Poseidus, for instance? 50% chance on winning the mount or will give you the mount?<br />

Having a chance to win loot? What does that mean? He's killing rare X that has 100% drop chance of Y item and if I help him, he gets the loot and I've a chance to win it as well?

All world bosses are now Tap to Faction. This new system offers every eligible player of the same faction that engages a boss the chance to earn loot. Under the new system, players will only be able to earn loot from each world boss once per week, but bonus rolls apply. Bosses will now respawn more frequently as well.</div></div><hr />

It's basically a complete separate roll of the loot table - as if you had killed it by yourself with nobody else around - for every player involved in the kill.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it will in the future (it should, imo!) but currently it only works on the new rares introduced in Patch 5.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just because they showed the boss up to 5 players doesn't mean that's the cap...<br />
<br />
Yes, very true. I just looked through my massive collection of screenshots and found one of Progentius at 26.6 million HP (he normally has 7.59 million), which means it does work for 6 players at least (Solo hp of 7.59 million plus a 250% increase). If there is a cap, I don't know what it is, and it is high enough that you will almost never encounter it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno all i see is this giving everyone the ability to kill opposite faction players without them being flagged by simply taggin it then standing back or near to keep the hp up on the mob. but i guess we'll have to wait and see how it works once fully implemented.<br />
<br />

<br />
Currently, only the World Bosses use faction-specific tagging. The rares on the island give out loot to both factions involved. That could be a bug or could be intended... hard to say. Either way, on PvP servers you will probably end up killing each other first, and on PvE servers faction grievances aren't nearly as big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

I like it for just this reason, I hate PVP and on a PVE server ... I have had several horde either attempt to get me flag OR get me killed to take a rare I was working on. Though I do get revenge by getting my hunter waiting till they are fighting (while still flagged because they were stupid to start with) and face rolling them with stampeed and taking the rare back. Point is this saves me and loads of other people trouble because of &quot;special&quot; people who like to steal rares that they didn't get to first.</div></div><hr />

Maybe uses the same tech as training dummies... if a player stops attacking for a few seconds, they exit combat, lose kill credit, and the health buff is removed. That's my guess.<br />
<br />
Of course, if another player is killing a rare mob, I don't really see what anyone would have to gain from trying to troll, when they could just participate and potentially get loot. The Pandaria rare mobs in particular have really cool and valuable drops.</div></div><hr />

Even with a 50% health boost it would be easier. An enemy with 10k health would jump to 15k health, but you'd have a second player contributing damage and debuffs, so together you'd probably be dealing at least double the DPS.<br />
<br />
The health boost is just so that it doesn't completely trivialize killing rares and quest mobs, otherwise you could get a group of 10 or 15 people together and kill everything super easily, and every single person would get their own loot chances.</div></div><hr />

This is so going to happen. Either will people just hit the target once and then go and get a pizza to grab the loot when comming back....or there will be groups that will triple the HP just for the fun of it and watch players die.<br />

Might become fun tho. Rare almost dead...next guy joins....rare again almost dead...next guy joins. Can't wait to see rare spawns with more HP than Deathwing...;-)</div></div><hr />

Blizzard sees an issue with the rare spawn/attitude of players, and tries to develop a system to counter it.<br />
If people do keep turnign up and tagging to increase HP, then leave, just report them.

Why not let it come into effect first, and see how it plays out before being all doom and gloom about something.

What kind of people do you guys interact with? When I see a mob and someone is hiting it in 5.2, ill just help him and get my loot, what is the issue? Why is everyone so freaking scared of change and shareing things with other players? I dont even think some of you realise or know how to read. You cant just simply it it and leave, it works like any other mob in this game, you need to be pretty freaking close to get credit to the kill, and be able to loot it. Why the fuck would you just hit it and leave? What kind of moron does this? You need to help kill the mob in order to aquire your loot. Honestly I ask again, with what kind of people do you play with that you are so afraid to shareing a killl with a fellow member of your faction.

Because it would only be 50% more health, which isn´t that much. Yes, it would be a little annoying, but if your goal was to get loot, why not just keep attacking it, if the other person has aggro.. it would take almost nothing for the additional player to do 50% of the original mobs health.<br />
<br />
Anyone who flat out trolled and only did one attack and then watched, would just be wasting their time as they would then have to sit around and wait a lot longer for the loot then if they just did some damage.</div></div><hr />

That is my thought too. The devs are some really smart guys. If I can read something and think of an exploit or annoyance in 5 seconds, the devs are probably already all over it. Only stupid players will try it, it won´t work and then they will learn it didn´t work.<br />
<br />
It is very similar to the new 5% wipe thing n LFR. I am 100% sure that the first week there will be some players saying ´I am going to suicide so we get the 5% buff´.. <br />
<br />
One thing I am curious about. the 50% buff to the mobs health.. is that 50% current or 50% of their original health. Either way does lead to some problems. If I have a mob down to 1% and someone comes up and hits it, and it jumps up to 51% of it´s original health.. that will be annoying... especially since this can happen repeatedly (lol, use your executes wisely). But if the 50% is only added to the current health, then this can be easily exploited by friends. A mob that is down to 5%, gets hit by a second player, and would jump to only 7.5% health. If this is the case, it benefits the player (both actually) if the second player watches until the mob is low on health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really think the devs will have some safety mechanisms in place. For instance, I can think of 3 right away<br />
<br />
1. A person must re-attack the mob every 10 seconds or lose their ´tap´. <br />
2. A person must do a minimum of 20% of the overall damage to the mob to receive loot.<br />
3. Any mob with less than 10% health cannot be tapped by another player.<br />
<br />
My guess is they will have a minimum of those 3 rules in place. I think any new feature that gets added to the game has some negative sides to it, and certainly no matter what, there will be some annoyances with this new system. But think about how much better this would have made golden lotus dailies overall... 3 steps forward, one step back is still progress.</div></div><hr />

Though if the player is a hunter / mage or rogue and they see the other player do this all they have to do is feign death, invis or vanish and thus dump the now higher HP mob on to the other player that decided to troll..</div></div><hr />

I don't really like the thought of rares turning into massive raid bosses if there's no cap on the hp buff, and faction-sharing loot doesn't make any sense for PvP servers (or even PvE). Hopefully, Blizzard will expound further on this 5.2 rares system before the patch is out.</div></div><hr />

I do agree that hunters, mages, and such can potentially get away with a kill. But the thing is, wouldn't an average player 'want' to help kill the mob to kill it faster and move on rather than sit and wait for it to be dead? Just a thought. I know some players 'will' sit and wait. But personally for me, I would help fight to get the job done. The increased health pool makes sense in that case if you think about it. It would actually be worse if it stayed the same. I think the logic behind the increased hp is to simply almost force the person tagging the rare to fight it to end it quicker.<br />
<br />
That's just a thought for those coming up with a conclusion.</div></div><hr />

What kind of people do you guys interact with? When I see a mob and someone is hiting it in 5.2, ill just help him and get my loot, what is the issue? Why is everyone so freaking scared of change and shareing things with other players? I dont even think some of you realise or know how to read. You cant just simply it it and leave, it works like any other mob in this game, you need to be pretty freaking close to get credit to the kill, and be able to loot it. Why the fuck would you just hit it and leave? What kind of moron does this? You need to help kill the mob in order to aquire your loot. Honestly I ask again, with what kind of people do you play with that you are so afraid to shareing a killl with a fellow member of your faction. (I will kill the other faction still, that wont change.)<br />

Not everyone needs to be a freaking asshole, unless you are one of them ofcourse.<br />

Crits were the reason a lot of people picked the class, so why do we have one of the lowest base crit ratings and why did they remove the crit chance from our abilities?

This might be a bit much to ask but the clarification would be super awesome. Was this tested outside the Isle of Thunder? There are new rares elsewhere and I'm really curious as to if it extends to them. Primarily I'm asking about the direhorn mount dropping guys in Jade Forest and the other zones.<br />
<br />
Also, does this mean it would be more effective to disband my group while fighting these things? Or does the personal loot rule overtake the standard party loot rule? Meaning can myself and my party member both potentially win the rare's drop while together?</div></div><hr />

We dont need to have energy for every f*cking gcd but at least for every secend gcd would be fine.

Compared with monks (i never played feral druid so i cant compare it) it feels slow as hell when you need energy for nearly every move. I dont mind if the regeneration is slow if the mechanics where the same and rogue finishers dont need energy only combo points.</div></div><hr />

The specialty of WindWalkers seems to be to sail past combat and pull even more mobs. Ret just feels so wrong. I mean, when leveling one it was a clusterf of CDs nearly ending on top of each other. <br />
<br />
As for Blizzards comments about Rogues and energy, they don't have an active filler and that is the problem with the class. I think rogues would be cool with an ability like steadshot/shieldslam/etc that adds energy. Give us something to do instead of watching a bar fill. I would rather have to fill it than watch it fill</div></div><hr />

You have it backwards. The extra loot for (read up) ONE HIT on the mob is a huge incentive to literally throw one spell on a rare NPC you see someone else killing, then keep on killing your quest mobs while the poor other dude has to deal with the extra 50% health before he gets his chance at loot. Now, imagine five players do this while questing. Ten players. You're starting to get the idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone who flat out trolled and only did one attack and then watched, would just be wasting their time as they would then have to sit around and wait a lot longer for the loot then if they just did some damage.<br />
<br />
I don't think you realize that trolls don't feel like any time is wasted when they are just there to grief you. They could care less about the loot. In fact now there's incentive for trolls to ally and each tag a rare once after someone else engages.</div></div><hr />
