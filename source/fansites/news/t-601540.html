Orc Shoulders<br />
A few people were worried because they couldn't see the orc shoulders changes mentionned in the PTR Patch notes. Don't worry, it's indeed fixed. <br />
Someone pulled the art from a current build instead of a future one where the shoulder art is fixed. I'll see if they can update it.<br />

I am Murloc<br />
I forgot to mention it yesterday, but if you can't get the &quot;I Am Murloc&quot; video from the Blizzard downloader, I mirrored it on Rapidshare (http://rapidshare.com/files/43386718/I_am_Murloc_US.avi)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But i won't complain of course :)</div></div><hr />

Wrong set bonus<br />
<br />
<br />
New Bonus : Each time one of your Corruption or Immolate spells deals periodic damage, you heal 70 health.<br />
<br />
Correct one</div></div><hr />

Thanks, that makes much more sense and i approve it much more since having<br />
<br />
a) UA being part of a set bonus doesn't make sense (unless blizz will make more than 1 wl set for each tier)<br />
b) CoA is not really part of a raid dot cycle (unless you raid with more than 2 warlocks and even then other curses are better suited i guess<br />
<br />
So overall: Nice change (since most raiding warlocks will have Corr and Immo on their targets)</div></div><hr />

You need to get your shadow damage up. :P<br />

I was talking about the set bonus = 70 per dot. Didn't add siphon life!<br />
<br />
Anyway, its only corruption and Immo. Still a savage amount of healing over a long fight.</div></div><hr />
