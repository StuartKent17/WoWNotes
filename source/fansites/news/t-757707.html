Sneak Peek: Troll &amp; Worgen Druid Forms<br />
It looks like the models I posted a few months ago were the final version. See below the blue post. <br />
We've applied some finishing touches to the new cat and bear forms available to troll and worgen druids in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. We’re excited to share them with you today. Have a look here. http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/druid-forms.shtml <br />

The Fight for Gnomeregan &amp; Echo Isles Q&amp;A<br />
It's great to see that so many of you are excited about these events! The battles for Gnomeregan and Echo Isles are important turning points for both the Gnomeregan Exiles and Darkspear trolls, and we're glad that players across all races and realms have answered the call to arms issued by your esteemed faction leaders, Geblin Mekkatorque and Vol'jin.<br />
<br />
Now, onto your questions:<br />
<br />
Q. What are the minimum level requirements for the Operation: Gnomeregan and Zalazane's Fall quest lines?<br />
A. Your character will need to be at least level 75 to participate in the final battle. All previous quests in each faction's chain, though, should be open to character's level 5 and up.<br />
<br />
Q. What would happen if a player were to complete one faction's quest line (say, Operation: Gnomeregan) on a character, receive the Feat of Strength, and then purchase a faction change? Would that character be able to complete the other faction's quest line and receive double the rewards?<br />
A. Yes and no. To continue with the example provided above, if a character were to complete all the quests associated with Operation: Gnomeregan on an Alliance character, receive the corresponding quest reward and Feat of Strength, and then purchase a faction change, the quest reward and Feat of Strength would translate to their Horde equivalents, but the quests would not. This means that the character would have the opportunity to play through all the quests associated with Zalazane's Fall, if he or she wishes, but would not receive an additional Feat of Strength or be able to own both faction’s costume quest rewards * for doing so.<br />
<br />
Faction changes affect characters in multiple ways, though, so be sure to review the full FAQ before getting started: http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/28825<br />
<br />
* Due to the fact that the costume quest reward will translate during a faction change, it’s currently possible for a player to earn two of them. They’d both be same version of the item, though, and would share the same cooldown.<br />
<br />
Q. Will these events be available forever?<br />
A. Like other holiday events, Operation: Gnomeregan and Zalazane's Fall will only be available for a limited time, so it's best to complete the quest lines as soon as possible!<br />
<br />
Q. Players are standing on top of key quest NPCs and I'm unable to reach them. What can I do?<br />
A. If you're finding it difficult to click on a specific NPC, the best course of action is to enable name plates by pressing Ctrl-V or zoom in your character's camera all the way. This will give you a different in-game perspective and should allow you to click on the NPC's name plate or its model without other characters or their mounts completely blocking access: http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/24589<br />
<br />
If you feel that any players are intentionally attempting to detract from the experience of others, then you may wish to contact in-game support.<br />
<br />
Q. Why are these events so short in duration?<br />
A. Both Operation: Gnomeregan and Zalazane's Fall are intended to be fun in-game events that allow players to experience the continuation of the Gnomeregan Exile and Darkspear troll storylines, and we think each quest line achieves just that. As several gnomes would argue, just because something is &quot;short&quot; doesn't mean it's not worthwhile! ;) <br />
<br />
[...] Alright, I've got a few more answers to your questions:<br />
<br />
Q. Are Operation: Gnomeregan and Zalazane's Fall the only events that lead into the Cataclysm?<br />
A. Not at all. It's only a taste of what's to come.<br />
<br />
Q. I've encountered a few issues when completing these events. Are they being looked into?<br />
A. Definitely. Our Quality Assurance department is aware of the reported issues and looking into them currently. In the meantime, our in-game support staff has created a post in the Customer Service forum about the matter (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26725724862&amp;sid=1) and will be providing updates on the @BlizzardCS Twitter page. <br />

Racial changes in Cataclysm<br />
We're not going to overhaul the racials to the degree that we overhauled the talent trees. We are going to make a pass at them, so if you have specific concerns for Cataclysm now is a fine time to bring them up. In this case, specific feedback is more useful than &quot;I think the way racials should work is a totally different way&quot; designs.

Zalazane's Fall / Operation Gnomeregan Overcloaks not implemented on live (See Cataclysm Prologue Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/697375-Cataclysm-Prologue-Gnomeregan-and-the-Echo-Isles))<br />
It is true that the cloak rewards had overcloak functionality when these events were up on the public test realms some months back. In the end we decided that implementing the cloaks in such a way that players could aesthetically change the cloak they're wearing could set a bad precedent. We like customization and flavor items, but we don't want to start implementing aesthetic items in the game which allow players to look however they want while keeping all the stats they want. We felt the overcloaks were breaking that barrier a little too much.<br />
<br />
Can I ask why not? People have been clamoring for this sort of thing for ages, and many thought that this was the first step to allowing that. Now you're telling us it was a first step that you don't want to take?<br />
We've been tossing around some other ideas with regard to gear customization, but we still want to make sure there are appropriate limitations on a system like this. The limited buff timer on the overcloak just wasn't enough considering it would mask any cloak of any level. We'll continue to explore ideas for fun aesthetic gear customization, but we didn't feel this was the proper introduction of this kind of system.

Dungeons too easy in WotLK<br />
This is fairly accurate. Spell costs were more expensive when LK was in beta but we later backed off of it. That isn't the entire reason that the heroic dungeons and raids ended up a little easier than we intended. It was a combination of a lot of things: we got better at designing talents (fewer wasted points), glyphs offered a lot of additional player power, little things like the gathering skill buffs, most raid buffs going raid wide, every spec had access to mana-efficient AE, more survivability tools, specs that historically didn't raid much suddenly out there contributing their unique abilities, etc. etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725724028/any-beta-healer-have-a-positive-review/))<br />
<br />
Avoidance penalty in Icecrown<br />
We added an avoidance penalty to Icecrown so that we could lower boss spike damage. It was still quite spikey. Now imagine would it would have been without those avoidance penalties. Bosses would have had to hit that much harder in order to compensate for missing so often. I even said at the time that a better long-term solution would be to boost health pools across the board (even for PvP), but that was such a big change that we worried it would take too many patches to get right.

Blizzcon Soundalike contest<br />
The Soundalike Contest will not be held this year, and potentially in no future years. We have some things planned for the stage show that take up some additional time, and just due to the lukewarm reception of this particular contest, it was removed from this year's lineup.

Lack of AE Healing in WotLK<br />
On the paladin issue, our LK model was that healers were still pretty specialized. You want a paladin for tank healing and you want a Holy priest or Resto druid for AE healing. We thought that paladins had enough tools to heal when they were the only healer (i.e. in 5 player dungeons), and that was generally true, though paladin players did have trouble with heroic Loken early on. Since paladins didn't need to solo heal raids and since we didn't want to encourage raids to bring 2 paladins for their 2 healers, we thought that was sufficient. In Cataclysm we are backing off of that even more and trying to make all the healers more well rounded.

If masking a cloak, which nobody recognizes and most people don't even show, is too much, then there is never going to be aesthetic gear customization.</div></div><hr />

The tiers on the other hand are pretty disappointing. Might be just the art style, but they don't look defined to me, just a bunch of malformed stuff thrown into an armor. I preferred tiers 1-2 to any other armor that they've made afterwards. These tiers had defined forms and were easy to identify. The current ones always are some variation of dark gray - dark brown with a couple protusions here and there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, How hard is it to make these new models with a decent color scheme? I mean &quot;yay okay we get new druids &amp; druid models&quot; But you know what... As many new models they make if it doesn't look good or AT LEAST try to look decent there's no point in making them. Fact is if it doesn't look good it's not going to be as popular.<br />

As for overcloaks, I'm extremely confused on their reasoning. You can bypass COMPLETELY the appearance of your character and his/her gear by using Deviate Delights, Pygmy Oil, THE BRAND NEW TROLL/GNOME PRIDE ITEMS FOR THIS EVENT, etc. How inconsistent. You can't really tell a level 1 cloak from a level 72 cloak anyway.</div></div><hr />

I honestly believed this to be the truth, they looked like existing models with bad tusks and messy manes tacked on, ideal as a work in progress in order for the team to REFINE it. The colours are far too harsh and unnatural (even the pink nelf druids still feel subtle enough to feel real for a fantasy setting) and the models make me flash back to the original tauren catform, ITS THAT BAD.</div></div><hr />

The Color schemes are fine, have you ever seen a witchdoctors outfit in real life? I like it, it really goes with the Troll-Aesthetic. Just because you and a couple of other forum-mongers agree that your (opinion) of the colors don't suit you doesn't make it a lazy attempt on Blizzards hand.

But whats with Blizz against gear customization ? Is it some system or game limit I wonder ? Or they just like everyone to look like clones.<br />
Bah, bet its somehow pvp related :P Almost every cutback is !<br />
<br />
Here's an easy solution :<br />
<br />
When you are in a BG, Arena, Wintergrasp (etc.) they make your &quot;true&quot; armor show. No choice. Suppose to be a &quot;solider in an army&quot; anyway right? What army doesn't have uniforms? Exactly.<br />
<br />
What about PvP servers you say? Open world PvP? No change. Adds to the suprise/risk. <br />
<br />
Limit customization to slot/type, i.e you have to wear plate shoulders over plate shoulders, 1H axe over 1H axe etc. Paladin can't wear Warrior armor, etc.<br />
<br />
So is everyone going to be running around in Tier 6? Maybe Paladins, give Blizz more motivation to make better Tier sets. <br />
<br />
Maybe give feats of Stength for equipping Tier sets that you had banked before change goes live etc. Reward the old school raiders. <br />
<br />
It'd have to be done post-Cata so they can have time to change/get rid of all the Rainbow Warrior 1-60 gear pieces. <br />
<br />
I'd even say add in &quot;Legacy&quot; gear pieces like Hierlooms that are JUST for asethetic customization, really cool stuff like the Imperial Plate Armor that makes you look like a Warcraft I/II/III Footman, but do the same for many race/class combos.</div></div><hr />

Then again, WoW always has had rather conservative customization options. It comes as no surprise to me that they decide to not implement overcloaks when the options to customize your character in general, especially when you create one, are as limited as they are today. Compared to other RPGs, WoW cares very little about player customization and though I personally prefer elaborate options to customize my toon, I believe it's something Blizzard wants to keep intact, to distinguish itself maybe, I don't know. I do know that a few years ago there was a huge discussion about customization in WoW and if I recall, some Blizzard dude said the simplicity of the customization of toons is often appreciated by the player base.<br />
<br />
Obviously not everyone agrees, but since so many people are hooked to WoW, I'm guessing the few customization options give just enough to satisfy the customization fans like you and I (I for one have RP sets on my toons even though none of them are on RP servers), and is limited enough to satisfy those who really think customization is a huge pain in the hole. From what I gather on game sites and in game reviews also, the amount of people who think elaborate customization is a pain and not a bonus is quite respectable, so meh, I kinda get where Blizzard is coming from.<br />

I don't care so much about overcloaks, it'd be a terrible feature without one to change other gear anyway in my opinion - I'd like more options for the creation screen though (the more, the better :D).</div></div><hr />

<br />
World of Warcraft is popular because the RTS games were popular, the UI and combat are user-friendly, and the client runs on virtually all computers. I cannot imagine a single person thinking &quot;I want to play WoW because I have less choices on how to make my character&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I agree. The Troll druid forms are awesome and by far the best druid forms yet... I WILL be changing my tauren to a troll besides the fact that (in their current state) the racials of the taurens suck for ferals (no warstomp in form) and I'm tired of not fitting through doorways on mounts, the troll forms just look so much better.</div></div><hr />

It's not that big of a deal to me or anything, I'll still be making my Worgen druid, but I just wish the forms were more ambiguous (think that's the right word) gender-wise.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree. I saw a funny post on the forums today<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally I think when pvpers see druids they curl up in a ball, suck their thumb and cry&quot;<br />
<br />
Because clearly it is gamebreaking for some PVP whiners that they MUST see their opponents gear. A better way to judge your opponents gear level is by checking out their class and Health. If I'm farming in WG and i see a warlock that has 25k health I'm probably going to keep flying, if i see a warlock with 13k health, I'm probably going to drop down and attack him. I'm not going to fly down, say &quot;stand still and don't attack!&quot; and stare at him to try and figure out what gear hes wearing....</div></div><hr />

Have you SEEN trolls before? Player trolls are all some crazy shades of green or blue with wild colored hair and face paint, nothing about trolls is &quot;normal&quot; as far as color goes, their druid forms are exactly what you would expect from a troll druid.

Now they finally get into letting us customize and then turn around and say no? Why offer race changes or haircuts? Way to be hypocritical, assholes.<br />
<br />
Over-reacting much? I'd suggest some mild sedative, or maybe just go out for a brisk walk.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of people go bananas in this topic over the no-customization-of-armor decision, basically (as always) the reaction is waaaaaay over the top and condemnations based on not actgually understanding the decision. Part of the fault is of course GC's who didn't explain it in enough depth for the rage prone masses.<br />
<br />
Thing is. It is not hypocritical - it seems hypocritical if you don't understand their reasoning. Blizz don't mind customization, when it doesn't undermine one of the foundations of the game: Which is - the game is to a large extent about getting gear. We can say what we want about in it for the challenge of a well designed enocunter (or arena match), or the social aspects, or the RP or a million other things. And all those are true, but the game is from the bottom down founded on the principle &quot;What we do in WoW is go around attempting to aquire more awesome gear&quot;. Take it away and you don't have much left of WoW.<br />
<br />
Allowing a few overcloaks wouldn't eliminate this of course, but it would definitely mean first move away from the gear oriented principles of WoW. Blizz usually don't like it when the &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument is brought up in the forums, but I think in this case, THEY are thinking in the terms of &quot;slippery slope&quot;. they don't want to undermine the importance of the gear grind, although they would never publically use the word &quot;grind&quot;, but the truth is that &quot;gear grinding&quot; is what most of us spend most of our time in the game doing.<br />
<br />
The other end of that &quot;slippery slope&quot; would mean that we no longer pick up gear in raids, we just pick up stats. Bosses would basically be dropping stats. In principle you could have them drop scrolls that upgrade the stats of &quot;My Coat of Badass Looks&quot; that you've been having for a long time. Some people might like that, but it would remove one big incentive from the gear grind, if gear upgrades did not somehow visually change your character.<br />
<br />
We could argue for a totally different game that wasn't as much about grinding gear as WoW is, but it would indeed be a completely different game and I can understand them not wanting to just start walking in that direction without looooots of thought.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with it being technically difficult, much less with them being idiots who don't understand what their players (think they) want, even less what ItachiZaku says, that they are just being a-holes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is incredibly stupid. For how much money is poured into the games, I think customers should be able to customize more than face, skin and hair. Considering that I've never actually heard someone full on praise a set of gear they've worked for.<br />
<br />
The answer to &quot;why not?&quot; was vague at best. I'm disappointed. And now stuck with a really stupid cloak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it stands now, it looks like everybody belongs to biker gangs because large swaths of people look nearly identical. You have the warlock gang, the hunter gang, and so forth. You could probably count the number of warlocks in Dalaran that don't look like a deatheater on one hand.<br />
<br />
I always thought it'd be a great feature if you could wear two sets of gear at the same time. One set for stats and another for aesthetics. One piece of gear could exist in both sets, obviously. Also, maybe exclude weapons from the dual-set functionality.<br />
<br />
At any rate, you would see Tier 11 warlocks running around looking like Tier 5 or what ever gear they feel looks best. Not everybody has the same tastes, so you would see some variety.<br />
<br />
They could also add more purely cosmetic e-peen gear pieces to show off, and that you can keep showing off as you upgrade your stats gear.<br />
<br />
You would think adding an overlay gear set would be easier than other approaches, such as dyes.<br />
<br />
It is Blizzard's game, though, and they can do what ever they want with it. I just hope it doesn't end up being some stupid, &quot;pay $x at the online store for these aesthetic gear changes&quot;, scheme.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree. Such reasonings are one of a very few things that make me look at a person and think: &quot;Is he uttermost retarded?&quot;.<br />

Forsaken Paladins would make no sense, because Paladins were/are immune to the Scourge plague.<br />
I agree that some of the new race+class combos are a bit wonky, though, even if they can be explained with lore.<br />
Paladins may be immune to Scourge, but Forsaken may be not immune to becoming Paladins. Anything can be explained with lore. It's a goddamn make-up story. And undead paladins sounds less ridiculous than cowman paladins, even by canonical fantasy standards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did it on my dk (favorite toon atm) and I never got the chance to hit anything due to it being yet another fail aoefest, I couldn't even death grip the odd mob away and kane it due to them all being instantly tapped by all the aoe spam.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kall</div><div class="date">2010-09-11, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quoting myself from the Blizz forums about the forms:<br />
<br />
&quot;Both forms are disappointing as hell. I was looking forward to make a decent looking druid, finally after nearly 6 years of this, only to find that the cat/bear forms are ridiculous looking.<br />
<br />
Coming from Blizzard I was expecting something a lot more worked out. I was expecting Amani stylized bears and Stranglethorn themed tigers, maybe I built to much of an expectation for a new druid race after all these years.<br />
<br />
I'll take the hat off to you in the matter of making them look like trolls, if that was the main objective - which makes sense - then you've done it, unfortunately you haven't done it spot-on. The key-feature of the forms being the Tomahawks was a nice idea, but imo it didn't turn out as well as you probably envisioned it at first.<br />
Trolls have immense treats in culture, from trinkets to bijous, to tusks and leathery armour, and even Tiki masks, it's my opinion that you should have picked up from there to define the troll forms. Imagine Amani bear with a bit less of armour on.<br />
<br />
The things that define the new troll forms as troll are the tomahawks and the (exaggerated, more on that below) colours. Other then that they seem like the ordinary (new) bearform, with some tweeks on it; stretched ears like Nelfs, stick a tomahawk, stick a pair of tusks and done with the &quot;new&quot; troll model.<br />
<br />
Moving onward to the colour palette, a few comments here and some others on Kotaku depict it as passing over the Paintbrush to an infant, or just tipping over the pain bucket accidentally. I feel exactly the same way specifically towards the bear form. Yes they are trolls, I love trolls, but that just doesn't seem to fit well in my (troll) book. I was expecting a more discreet colour scheme (yet varied ofc) and that the that's-a-troll-druid effect would be passed down by those trinkets; bijous; masks I mentioned earlier. I mean, even the side-tattoo is exactly the same as every other bear form...<br />
<br />
The tigers on the other hand should (again imo) have been handled with more familiar tigresque colours. If you look at it now, the main colour is black/dark. That should be one variation, not 3 or 4 of them.<br />
Notice the Tauren cat forms, they are just AMAZING, tons of love went in to it obviously, and their main colour scheme are shades of brown, plus (if memory serves) 1 black and 1 white. The same premiss should have gone into trolls. Orange/Yellow shades should have been the primary palette, not black. Black Panthers are more rare to see both in real life as they are in-game, and here we're getting 4 of them with no real colour difference (unlike tauren) between them.<br />
<br />
To conclude, this alone disappointed me a lot after so much expectation to get a new horde druid race, and I'm going Tauren after all because, well, the forms are just amazing, they were built from scratch to fit taurens (and Nelfs while we're at it) and they excel at it. Using those same forms to improvise troll forms was just totally wrong in my point of view.&quot;</div></div><hr />
