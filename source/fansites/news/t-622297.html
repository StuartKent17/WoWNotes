Hello everybody, I have to correct my previous statement: We can not make sure Wrath of the Lich King will be available as a download on the release day. Please excuse the caused confusion.<br />

Wrath of the Lich King available for download on release day ?<br />
This is probably the most confusing news post ever if we consider that yesterday, I reported that Wrath of the Lich King wouldn't be downloadable on Day 1. However according to an official post on the german forums, Blizzard will make the game available for download on release day! I wouldn't take it as 100% sure before we see an US post about it but it's not the first time we see something announced in europe first. <br />
<br />

Arena End Reminder<br />
The next Arena season will begin on December 16th !<br />
We wanted to remind everyone that Arena season 4 is coming to a close. During next Tuesday's maintenance, all arena teams, as well as ratings, will be wiped and arena charter NPCs disabled. Thus, arena points will, unfortunately, not be rewarded for rated games played this week.<br />
<br />
The next Arena season will begin on December 16th, and once that happens players at level 70 will be able to participate in rated matches against level 70 opponents and gain Arena points for item purchases but will not count towards the end of season rewards. At the same time, level 80 players will be able to compete in rated arena matches where they can gain arena points which can be used to purchase level 80 arena gear, as well as compete for end-of-season rewards. Additionally, players at level 70 will continue to be able to play skirmish Arena matches against other level 70 opponents even after Wrath of the Lich King launches. It's also important to note that two new skirmish brackets (71-75, 76-80) will be available for players who wish to hone their Arena skills while leveling in Northrend. <br />
<br />
<br />
Two New Arenas<br />
With the latest patch release, we’ve added two new arenas: the Dalaran Sewers and the Ring of Valor in Orgrimmar. These arenas offer new obstacles and challenges for strategy savvy players. The arenas have been added to the random rotation and are accessible via the queue system as Skirmishes. For more information on these two new arenas, please visit http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/insider/11/arena.xml (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/insider/11/arena.xml). Both Dalaran Sewers and the Ring of Valor will also be available for tournament play during Arena Season 5. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pet Defensive Change<br />
We recently changed the way defensive stance works for pets. In the old design, the pet would not attack a target that you were attacking until it did something to generate threat - typically attacking you. In the new design, as soon as you attack a target, the pet will attack the target too. Our thinking was that this made defensive a little easier to use and you still have passive to override that behavior.<br />
<br />
However, we have heard from some players (hunters mostly, though this isn't just a hunter issue) that they prefer the old defensive stance. We wanted to get a little more feedback from players on the issue.<br />
<br />
In order to keep this readable, please don't stray into other hunter or pet issues that don't directly affect this topic. Also please don't attempt to redesign the feature (such as having four stances).<br />

Europe - Realm Compensation<br />
We have now credited all eligible accounts with this compensation. You should be able to see this in your Account Management. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/6584589410-realm-compensation.html))<br />
<br />
Professions - New recipes<br />
It is very likely that we will be adding more recipes to all trade skills as the content progresses. The reason the crafter only weapons were done away with however was that most people chose to take the profession purely for the purposes of being able to skip ahead of the content or not do the content because smithing provided them with something far easier to attain than anything else they could normally get. While this is ok from time to time with an occasional piece of gear, the concept of crafters making &quot;best in slot&quot; items was more or less considered bad from our end. When many people dropped the trade skills they enjoyed simply because taking a different trade skills made them more powerful (Stormherald, Frozen Shadowweave) than that is clearly not what we intended.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;what do I get from profession X&quot;, well I think many of the posters in this thread have pointed that out. All trade skills now provide some special benefit to the crafter that isn't just a super item. In the case of blacksmithing it's the ability to add sockets to your gear. Most of the profession perks are relatively equal in terms of what they provide, some are slightly better than others, but not enough so that you should feel ou are missing out by doing the profession you enjoy doing.

Circle of Healing / Wild Growth / Chain Heal<br />
Based on feedback from this forum, elsewhere and our own brainstorming, what we are thinking about right now is something like a 6 sec cooldown for Circle of Healing and Wild Growth.<br />
<br />
We're less concerned about Chain Heal, in part because it's not instant, prevents movement, falls off with multiple targets, and is the spell that shamans are supposed to be hitting, while priests and druids have many other spells.<br />
<br />
At 6 seconds, you would still want to use CoH/WG in the right situations (though hopefully not *every* time they are up), but you'd also want to use other spells during the cooldown. To be fair, a lot of priests and druids are asking to push other buttons.<br />
<br />
This sounds like a potentially scary change because it has a lot of ramifications -- one of the reasons we are mentioning it so early is to get feedback. We don't want Resto shammies to push other healers out of raids. We would change some of the encounters knowing that CoH spam was no longer possible. <br />
<br />
Didn't you try this before ?<br />
Yeah, we did. We thought it would feel like a big nerf and changed our minds. But seeing the state of healing at 80 makes us think it might be the right call again. When AE healing is so prominent, it also makes specs without great AE heals (Holy paladins and Disc priests) feel uselss.<br />
<br />
Assume that we would lower Wild Growth by the same proportion as Circle of Healing. The exact numbers aren't as important to this discussion as the concept that you can't hit the button whenever you want. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12454625400-examination-on-cohs-overuse.html))<br />

Starfall<br />
So this took some digging but apparently there was a change to stealth in between 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 so that the stars would no longer target a stealthed opponent. The AE splash from a star hitting another target will contine to take a stealther out of stealth. Maaven's answer was technically correct. It isn't a bug in that we changed the stealth code.The change to Starfall wasn't intended so we're trying to decide if we want to change it back or leave it in its current form. I'm not sure the world will end either way, but I wanted to provide an update since it was a bit of a head scratcher.

Autoshot not casting during Volley<br />
That is by design. Even if it wasn't by design, the current implementation is a good idea because Volley does so much damage now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12354807735-hunter-bug-x2-since-303.html))<br />
<br />
Cat pet DPS nerfed and exotic pets balance<br />
We made a big pass on pet dps for 3.0.3 so I'm not sure if your tests are reflecting those changes or not. Cats are still a good dps pet, but they shouldn't flat out beat every exotic. The exotic balance is obviously tricky. BM of all hunters shouldn't be forced to only be able to pick from the relatively small pool of exotic pets.

<br />
Disengage wasting the cooldown/mana when rooted<br />
Is this in 3.0.3 (the most recent patch)? We actually made a change to prevent it from using the mana. You just get a &quot;Can't do that&quot; error if rooted. Can anyone confirm? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12454625733-ghostcrawlerconcerning-disengage.html))<br />

Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12368278063-mage-status-update-please.html))<br />
1) You fixed Deep Wounds, where is our Ignite fix?<br />
Unfortunately, they are apples and oranges with regard to fixes. Ignite sometimes munching charges has a lot to do with Internet lag. We just can't always tell when one hit lands a split second before another one. We are still working on it though because it's a cool talent. I know I have personally answered this question many times, so I'm surprised you couldn't find that answer. <br />
<br />
2) You are spending resources to make Disengage work, where is our Blink fix? <br />
If we can fix the problem with slopes and minor obstructions that will apply to both talents. Disengage has some additional bugs that Blink doesn't have. <br />
<br />
3) What's going on with Spirit? It's still a throw away stat. <br />
Strength is a throw away stat. Spirit benefits you, just not as much as you'd like. We're talking a lot about all of the &quot;converts one stat into another talents.&quot; Many of those were implemented to solve problems with different specs sharing gear. We're not sure we want to go down the road of providing talents to convert every second tier stat into a primary stat. That list would get long. <br />
<br />
4) What's going on with Arcane? Are we going to get a new rotation because we're perceived to be OP in PvP? <br />
We would like to give you a new rotation mostly because Arcane Blast doesn't really work in PvE and because the PvP &quot;rotation&quot; seems to be: something -&gt; something -&gt; bored -&gt; ARCANE BARRAGE!<br />
<br />
On the OP issue, here is one of those times where people are calling for nerfs but we don't believe it's a problem. To everyone who thinks we knee jerk based on QQ posts, here is a case where that's not happening. <br />
<br />
5) What's going on with Frost? Are we going to see some shatter combos?<br />
You have some. If you mean in PvE, we would like to provide some. The two things standing in our way at the moment are: 1) Frost PvE dps is already high, so we would have to nerf it in order to build it back up through combos (which seems to be fine with a lot of Frost mages, but isn't the highest priority ATM because the issue is &quot;not interesting enough&quot; instead of &quot;broken&quot;), and 2) Frost Bolt just does more damage than Ice Lance. If we buff Ice Lance, then PvP shatters are too high. So we need to rebuild the spells and talents to make the whole thing work -- it's not an easy fix. But it's something we want to do.<br />
<br />
I know we have neglected the beta forums. Beta is ending soon and I thought it was more important to try and invest a little energy in getting these role forums off to a good start. <br />
<br />
2) &quot;NOOBS PLAY RETADINS AND HUNTARDS...&quot; (of course, I'm paraphrasing)... &quot;AND THERE ARE MORE NOOBS THAN MAGES.&quot;<br />
The real reason has to do with the fact that we changed paladin and hunter mechanics quite a bit, so they are understandably going to require more iteration. But I try as a rule not to pay attention to &quot;who has gotten the most attention&quot; issues. That's just a losing battle for me. <br />

Sheath of Light<br />
Sheathe was designed to let Ret make use of the fact that, yanno, the spec actually is part of a healing class. But we can totally understand why a talent designed for someone with low healing stats that isn't healing a lot would be attractive to someone with high healing stats that did heal a lot.

Sanctified Wrath is not giving us the &quot;bypasses 50% of damage reducing effects&quot; effect when we pop AW. It hasn't been since the 3.0.3 patch.<br />
We think we accidentally broke this effect. It wasn't an intentional nerf, but we're still looking into it. [...] Update: We did break it. We should be able to hotfix this soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065191999-s-most-paladins-are-wanting-answers-to.html))<br />

Starfall and rogues<br />
So this took some digging but apparently there was a change to stealth in between 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 so that the stars would no longer target a stealthed opponent.

Elemental Shaman balance at lvl 70<br />
Fun is very relative. I think shamans are fun now. Obviously other players may disagree. I think the part where shamans aren't as fun is actually at low level when you don't have a lot of spells and are forced to either slowly drop your totems every fight or just live without them. <br />
<br />
I think the shaman is definitely playable now. The class doesn't crash your client when you play one and if your damage is low at all, it certainly isn't at 50% of other specs.<br />
<br />
Being a good raid member now (and at 60) is important to us, but far, far less important than at 80. The number of raids being done at levels less than max is a trivial number and we would be doing a disservice to most of our customers if we spent too much effort to solve such edge cases. I also think there would be howls of protest if we announced we were slipping LK in order to address balance concerns at 60 and 70. Everyone knows Lich King is going to ship next week. We tried to give you plenty of fun things to do (achievements, raiding EZ mode, zombies) since some of the class changes to prepare for LK started going in several weeks ago.

Another humorous post. GG Holy Paladins. Other classes have more buttons and devs are giving them attention in case their raiding is boring. Have they EVER raided as a holy paladin? I mean with downranking for HL out of the picture I'm not even using rank 4 to keep Light's Grace up. Oh well. I love my pally even if he only has 1 heal per release.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtamori</div><div class="date">2008-11-07, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hit the source on the Paladin Sheathe of Light quote, and it seems people still don't understand how Sheathe of Light HOT works. While it's awesome for a pocket-healer in a raid (if the Paladin has time to change gear, since a Ret geared Paladin won't be able to cast a meaningful amount of heals to be remotely useful in raids), it's not necessarily a benefit at all in pure healing.<br />
The more you crit the worse the talent get. Assuming 100% crit rate, and Sheathe of Light is just a talent sink for a GCD-to-GCD healing Paladin (since it'll never tick).<br />

<br />
Theyre not out of touch, theyre just changing the games audience.<br />
<br />
Like or lump it, blizzard now aims this game at the casual player, theyve removed any difficult or slightly challenging aspects of the game out. Spellpower change / all professions BoE / class homogenisation, all contributing to it.<br />

At this moment, as a healing priest, I use CoH a lot of times (could be too much) but Blizzard is telling me now I need to use other spells. OK, sure thats nice but greater heal then? If I ever see a target low on health I cast it but at the time it almost going to land a shaman chainheal, or a spamhealing paladin already landed enough heals to get him back up. Sure we have a flashheal but that is very mana intensive to get people up in health, then we have our imba shield (was imba at MC time) but these days its almost none usable becouse one hit of a target will be more damage most time then the shield will prevent. Our PoM is nice but I have seen that a target is been killed before taking affect (atleast was told to me) and you cant predict where the charges are going. Then our renew, finally a nice spell.<br />
Our two last changes to get people up are lightwell but like a lot of people already telling, why should a dps think about anything different then dps. They simple will not use it.<br />
And last Prayer of Healing: Only our own group and long castingtime for a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
If I see it then raidleaders can simple get some shadowpriests in for buffing, paladins in becouse of faster healing then a priest will ever be for lots of damage so you can write of priests as healers. I would even take a druid in aboce a priest simple becouse of innervate and combatress. Also he is way more manaefficient then a priest will be. I am pure negative probably but a couldown of 6 seconds on CoH without a spell between flashheal and greater heal is killing priests. Get us a spell that is as manaefficient and fast enough so we can spam that one (even getting us more a paladin status :( ). Now I realy need to get only haste and crit these days with the change of Holy Concentrate. Now only crit will be meaningfull</div></div><hr />

Take all healing spells that a Priest has. Then remove everything that isn't single target direct heal. You've got two spells left. That's the Paladin's arsenal.<br />
<br />
If he can do it with two spells, you can do it with those two spells and the myriad of extra spells you get. Mana issues aside, be pro-active (start heal before they need it) and don't rely on spammable AOE to get people up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeeb</div><div class="date">2008-11-07, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CoH<br />
<br />
Fairly concerned about the CoH nerf myself, ran so many raids recently and yes CoH was doing too good of a job but only when the rest of the healers were basically doing the job for me. What i mean is due to the nerfs in raids atm the fights just aren't as healing intensive (apart from raid dmg) so we can run around like a idiot spamming CoH, but this is ONLY when there are already too many healers. Other raids when i had to keep a close eye on the MT/OT and using predictive heals then CoH was doing its job i can only presume as was intended. Only accounting for 20% of my healing. So when we finally get to 80 and i presume raids will be harder (so i hope lol) we wont have this great heal.<br />
<br />
Better sum this up<br />
<br />
-Raids are easy atm less dmg and a lot less health<br />
-The reason CoH is doing well now is because we as healers are overgearing instances and can afford the mana and time to not be keeping a close eye on the tanks<br />
-In LK CoH looks to be less powerful anyway with only a small increase in rank and we all know CoH has a low coefficient (not sure exact numbers soz)<br />
-Helaers wont be able to spam CoH in LK anyways not throuhout the fight or we'l go oom and tanks will die<br />
-If a nerf is indeed needed wait til lvl 80 maybe then probably be a good idea to take away the smart heal aspect if any nerf is intended.<br />
-Imagine trying to heal throught the spirit bolts in ZA, raid dmg comes in fast i throw 1 CoH prob increases health by 10% meanwhile spirit bolts is still being cast, i know i wont be sitting for 6secs waiting and using other spells but if CoH wasn't intended for this sort of situation what is it intended for it doesn't heal much that why its spammable and its fairly mana costly to spam it, probably about 15secs of spamming and oom. I was using CoH to keep every1 up in ZA yesterday and CoH only just keeps every up, their health still drops during spirit bolts<br />
<br />
excuse my rant but yes i am agreeing its being abused atm but i dont think this will be the case come progressive raids when the fights are more about endurance preserving mana and needed to keep a close eye on tanks</div></div><hr />

Edit: I don't even get the ludicrous high cooldown they are suggesting, or the lack of feedback about this number either. *If* they wish to slap a cooldown on it, make it the same as the casting time of Chain Heal, since people love to compare (read: whine about) all AoE heals no matter their function/role.<br />
<br />
So, not six but a three second cooldown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only healing spec/class that had/has _any_ right to complain are *Holy Paladins*.<br />
<br />
Shamans lost their ability to 'guarantee' their raidspot anymore with the Chain Heal excuse. They now actually have to use other, directive healing spells next to Chain Healing. When the raid receives sufficient damage as a whole, Wild Growth/CoH kicks in.<br />
<br />
Basically, Shamans used to the whole Chain Heal pigeonhole can't grasp this concept of adaptation and QQ'd about it. I for one was glad Blizzard pulled me out of the pigeonhole of Lifebloom, by granting me a spell such as Wild Growth. Which will turn less useful for a second time in it's short history. Why couldn't Shamans embrace theirs ?<br />
<br />
I know I will adapt, till the day 'the numbers' will show that inducing a flat cooldown on -any- healing spells is a terribad idea.<br />
<br />
And about these 'numbers'. Sunwell Plateau and Naxxramas are not the places to get a glimpse/idea of how things are settling. In both instances people in even Sunwell Gear will outgear the place, stack trash on top to AoE it down and thus trivializing a large portion of this instance. Try looking at Sartharion on hardmode, where you actually need people in different areas, several tanks spread out -and- have large amounts of raid damage with a set interval.</div></div><hr />

Shamans have AoE healing as their baseline. Priests/Druids have a talent tree building to their AoE healing spell, and those respective spells are even obtained with talents. Shamans do not have such a thing. (Admitting this situation is worse for Priests then 'us' Druids)<br />

Be fair Chain heal is quite poor untalented, also CoH and WG are far better than chain heal at the moment. I am sure that if Riptide and renew turned out to be the greatest HoTs all you Druids would be quite upset.<br />

<br />
<br />
And most likely CH needs to be adjusted to be more on par with CoH, not CoH (or WG for that matter) nerfed to make a seemingly broken Shaman spell seem less broken.<br />
<br />
In TBC Priests and Druids used single target healing spells, where Priests could even use a AoE heal now and then. All Shamans did was cast Chain Heal 9 out of 10 times. Now we Druids and Priests can use more AoE healing (when required) next to our single target spells and find a balance. Shamans should balance as well and go a bit further away from Chain Heal and use their single target spells more often.<br />
<br />
Druid's have HoT's as their 'niche', Shaman's 'niche' is AoE healing and Priests 'niche' is being good overall in all three areas.<br />
<br />
(Arguments aimed towards how 'bad' some of the encounter design in TBC was, is for another completely different discussion, but I agree, has some ties to the healing issues.)</div></div><hr />

WTF @ the profession discussion. What's the point of professions now? Why would anyone in their right mind grind professions up (GOLD SINKS, always have been always will be) if everything good is BOE?!?!?!<br />
<br />
It's not like certain classes/specs are restricted from leveling professions if they want them. That was their whole philosophy in BC: GIVE THE CRAFTING PROFESSIONS GOOD GEAR SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY USED THEM.<br />
<br />
Now it will be just like vanilla, where the crafting professions are totally worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, this means that everyone that isn't attached to a profession for some reason will be a Blacksmith and something else (either a Leatherworker, a Jewelcrafter, or a Scribe), and things like Mining, Herbalism, Tailoring, and Engineering will be relegated to alts or become things of the past.<br />
<br />
Though I guess it's a good way to delimit the number of Mechano-Hogs/Mekgineer's Choppers that are made - only the stubborn, staunch Engineer proponents will retain the profession, and there's no way in hell you'll convince them to fork over the only profession-defining thing they have. :)</div></div><hr />

The Eye doesn't have much in terms of AOE healing to be done. The big constructs do some AOE, but that is easily avoided by ranged people and can be dodged by melee. The engineers do toss grenades, but that should be healed up very, very, easily with a low amount of COH.<br />
Most, if not all, The Eye is single target healing. If not then you are doing it wrong.<br />
<br />

I don't know a single shaman that has complained about being moved out of one-button spammers. We've complained that CoH/WG have left Chain Heal in the dust while our single-target heals are more mana-inefficient and weaker than every other healer's, and the Illumination C&amp;P talent they gave us as incentive to use them is weaker at best and lowers our actual ability to heal at worst.<br />
<br />
<br />
The difference in this case is that we agreed Chain Heal virtually *was* the Resto shaman. It was one of their most signature abilities, like Mortal Strike for the Arms warrior, Windfury for the Enhancement shaman or Frostbolt for the Forst mage. While you might like Circle of Healing, and I know it's a fun spell, we never designed the entire Holy tree around it.<br />
<br />
Which is why we redesigned the entire Restoration tree away from Chain Heal...?</div></div><hr />

-Imagine trying to heal throught the spirit bolts in ZA, raid dmg comes in fast i throw 1 CoH prob increases health by 10% meanwhile spirit bolts is still being cast, i know i wont be sitting for 6secs waiting and using other spells but if CoH wasn't intended for this sort of situation what is it intended for it doesn't heal much that why its spammable and its fairly mana costly to spam it, probably about 15secs of spamming and oom. I was using CoH to keep every1 up in ZA yesterday and CoH only just keeps every up, their health still drops during spirit bolts<br />
<br />
excuse my rant but yes i am agreeing its being abused atm but i dont think this will be the case come progressive raids when the fights are more about endurance preserving mana and needed to keep a close eye on tanks<br />
<br />

If you are are actually geared for ZA then a lifebloom or 2 is all you need to keep you up. A lot of classes can survive the bolts with no healing if they pot/ PW:S/ VE is ticking. Plus with the new pushback mechanics you could probably just heal them. Renew much? CoH is great for that time I won't lie. But even if it received the drastically long CD of 6seconds you could still use it TWICE during Sbolts which would be enough. Esp if you have a second healer there to help, which you do.</div></div><hr />

Way to take the quote out of context. That statement was in response to claims that the shaman class is unplayable, and GC addressed the issue in the next part of the sentence. That statement was quite obviously in jest, since the claim that shamans are unplayable is obvious hyperbole.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say but thats a load of rubbish can't renew 10 ppl in that time and it ticks aprox 1K every 3 secs when spirit hits for 450 every 0.5 sec, alternatives we do have would prayer of healing for 1 group and flash's for the other but when we talent into CoH and this chance comes to use it, it does the job as intended its not OP, and with a 6 secs cd 2 CoH would only make up for 4 hits spirit bolts which would land in 2 secs, spamming CoH atm only just keep up 10 ppl. <br />
<br />
In the 10 ses spirit bolts land we could get in 2 CoH, he would dmg each person for 9000 in 10secs and we'd heal for 2K with CoH alone. So no CoH being used twice would not be enough, not by a long shot</div></div><hr />

Thank you Blizzard for helping me chose which character I will be making my main come expansion. The first character I ever made was a holy priest because I like how versatile the healing was. I could have chose a holy paladin for bubble/plate/mana efficiency, but I chose to wear cloth/have some of the worst mana regen out of the healing classes(imo of course)/being able to be easily ganked by almost anyone. And now a Holy priest's bread and butter are being nerfed hardcore. I feel like paladins and shamans alike have been qqing a lot about their class and this is blizzard's way of pleasing those classes(holy paladins). Healers are going to be in even more demand come the expansion and I personally will not be one of those healers anymore unless something is done about this. I will now be leveling my tank first and make it my main.<br />
<br />
BTW, when you implement this nerf... could you please refund our talent points like you did for druids last week so that I can spec something other than &quot;lol&quot; holy now without wasting 50g?</div></div><hr />

Quit whining already. And Druids received a free respec because they dropped a talent from 5 to 3 points. Any Boomkin would have an invalid talent spec if they didn't get reset.</div></div><hr />

Who comes to your raid with less than 7001 hp? The only person who should be below 100% hp is the tank and he better have more than that. Plus, as I stated, you are not the only healer. Pretend there were 2 of you. That is now 4 CoHs, and maybe 4 FHs? If your raid members cannot survive a wave of sbolts with that healing you should not be in ZA.</div></div><hr />

And when mobs are hitting harder on the tanks CoH is not of any use either its back to good old Gheal, as wrote in my earlier post its only on the easier stuff that the aoe heals seem to be OP<br />
To be fair, the developers have already said they had to deisng content like Sunwell Plateau with a lot of AoE because the other healers felt Holy Paladins were a little too good in the first 2 tiers of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Of course, when massive AoE damage (why hello there Bloodboil) came into play, Holy Paladins just couldn't do anything but cry as they tried to keep a raid spot.<br />
<br />
Ever heard of Holy Paladins sitting outside the Plateau just to buff the group?<br />
<br />
Another thing, the developers said they wouldn't design content with massive AoE like they did in SW but they'd find more ways to make challenging encounters.<br />
<br />
Finally, I believe it's pretty clear what role each spec has.<br />
<br />
Restoration Shaman = AoE healers<br />
Restoration Druids = Heal tanks with their HoTs / Help with raid healing<br />
Holy Paladin = Tank healer<br />
Holy Priest = All of the above.</div></div><hr />

GFT. Holy Paladins have the short end of the stick in healing with nothing unique or situational to bring to the table.</div></div><hr />

Funny because in PVP my Paladin completely wipes my Shammy in healing done, survivability, efficiency and overall contribution. Even funnier is that my pala is wearing measly S2+a few other pieces whilst my Shammy is vastly better equipped.<br />

Oh I forgot - only the raids matter..</div></div><hr />

Recently since they made it smart the only thing I have to do is target myself and spam the CoH button. Yes there is very little overhealing and I am always top with other CoH priests...<br />
<br />
Adding a cooldown like 6 secs to CoH will kill the priest group healers and will pretty much kill the class as a viable raid healer... <br />
<br />
Why not meet in the middle Blizzard and change the CoH back to not been &quot;SMART&quot; and not having a cooldown.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for the other priests even though I have actually agreed with my guild to change to roll a lock for expansion.</div></div><hr />
