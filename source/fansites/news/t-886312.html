<br />
Q: When will achievements finally be awarded account-wide? – Larosh (Europe [German]), Eneia &amp; Payasos (Europe [Spanish]), Rageudder &amp; Kellgros (Europe [English]), Деадхил (Europe [Russian]), Nyn (North America/ANZ), ****무나 (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Making achievements Battle.net account-wide is something we'd like to do, but it's not a goal we could provide a current timetable for. All of the original World of Warcraft coding was done with the expectation that the data on every realm would always be independent. Now that we are trying to make as many things as possible account-wide, we’re having to rebuild all of those systems. It is absolutely something we want to do, but it will take a lot of time away from other features.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will we ever be able to spend our achievement points on something? Or will there be a feature where it will be required to have x amount of points? – Nordicberry (Europe [English]), Hogosha &amp; Wulkuhr (Europe [German]), Neroth (Europe [French]), Kularia (Northa America/ANZ), Trafalgarlaw (Latin America)<br />
<br />
A: We want Achievements to remain as an optional thing you can do as bragging rights, or to challenge yourself. As soon as we add any kind of player power, or use them to gate anything, then they feel mandatory for a lot of players. In fact, we think one of the reason achievements are fun is that the drive to complete them is totally up to you, which keeps them (hopefully!) from feeling like a chore. If you want to go after some achievements that's a choice, and choosing not to care about achievements doesn't mean you're making your character less powerful.<br />
<br />
We do offer pets, mounts and titles for specific achievements, and we’re unlikely to ever do anything much more “mandatory” than those.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Do you plan to implement more achievements directly linked to professions or classes? – Cith (Europe [French]), Tsuteymanga (Europe [English]), Sergan (Latin America)<br />
<br />
A: Until we can do Battle.net account-wide achievements it would be pretty cruel of us to offer achievements for say Illustrious Grand Master Alchemy, Blacksmithing and Jewelcrafting on the same character. The same is true of classes. The best we could to today would be to have something like “Land a Pyroblast for X damage” and have an equivalent one for all 10 classes, since you could get only one. We do have more room with the guild achievements, since not every task needs to be completed by one player. We’ll continue to look for fun achievements for Cooking, Fishing, First Aid and Archaeology until then.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will we ever see a change to the Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin exalted achievement /reputation grinds? While normally a fan of time consuming achievements, these two seem to be a tad excessive. Warsong moreso as you can go entire games without gaining any reputation at all. You could in theory lose every AB you ever do, and eventually get exalted at a &quot;reasonable&quot; pace. Perhaps award rep for Flag returns, killing efcs, capping bases, HKs similar to Alteracy Valley, etc. – Idkmybffyata (North America/ANZ), Lunaticheart (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: We think those are fine as achievements. They definitely take a huge time commitment, but so do some of the other achievements. And you don’t need to get them for the meta achievements.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: As some achievements like The Keymaster and the Shen’dralar reputations have been removed, have you considered creating a Feat of Strength for those achievements or is it possible that we get them back in the future like normal achievements? – Enarhion (Europe [Spanish]), Деадхил (Europe [Russian])<br />
<br />
A: We added a Feat for Exalted Shen’dralar rep in 4.1. We’re unlikely to add a Keymaster feat.<br />
<br />
We added the Keymaster achievement and then almost immediately decided to deemphasize the existence of keys in the game, and thus removed the achievement. Unfortunately it probably isn't even possible to track who had the older keys now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Guild Achievements related with professions are much more difficult than other Guild Achievements. Is there any plan to give a chance for small guilds to get those Achievement rewards? –*미** (Korea), Joq (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: We think some of these are way too high and we plan on lowering them to more sane numbers for 4.1. The Pen is Mightier glyph achievement for example would have been reasonable with the old glyph model but is ridiculous today. We were waiting to collect some additional data from guilds currently working on those achievements, but we feel like we have enough information now to lower them. Pen is Mightier for example will go from 25,000 glyphs to 2,500 in 4.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I'd like to see the achievement system become more active and dynamic, will we ever see achievements that unlock quest lines, dungeons, or other Easter egg content as a reward for dedicating so much time in Azeroth? – Grandevil (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Probably not. As we said above, we want Achievements to feel optional. Some players don’t care for the game of collecting pets or mounts, so they still feel like they can opt out of achievements. If there was a cool quest line involved, then players who felt like they could safely ignore achievements in the past would now have to go back and play catch up. If you are doing achievements today, it should be because you like to do them, not because you’re hoping for some additional reward to materialize in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Currently, the achievement rewards are more focused to common tasks, such as raids, events, PvP. Have you considered creating achievements with rewards that ask to do crazy things around the world, like for example, soloing bosses or mobs, or more achievements like the “Jenkins” one, that are meant to do crazy things. – Thodyr (Europe [Spanish]), Khaelthas (Europe [French]), Assmira (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: We like for achievements to be fun, but we don’t want for players working on achievements to have a huge negative impact on other players. At first glance, soloing a boss mob might sound like a decent achievement. But consider that if the achievement is very easy to do then hitting all those dungeons may just feel like a chore. On the other hand, if it’s challenging to do then we suddenly have to go back and worry about class balance in a way we never had to before. Blood DKs for example excel at soloing older bosses because of their self-healing mechanic, but the same isn't true of most other classes and specs. We try not to have achievements that require you to ask your group to do something really bizarre or not fun. “Run a dungeon without picking up any loot,” would just be frustrating every time you had to debate with your group whether you were going for the achievement or not. “Jenkins” is a fun for a silly achievement, considering its history, but too much of that sort of thing would get tedious pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will we ever see a &quot;search&quot; feature in the achievement window? That's a lot of achievements to search through if you're looking for something specific. – Grandevil (North America/ANZ), Lonik (Europe [Spanish])<br />
<br />
A: Yes, this is something we plan on doing. The current UI makes it hard to find specific achievements. There are several places in the current UI that could benefit from a smarter search.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will you ever bring back the mounts for achievements that were removed (Naxx Glory runs) as you didn't remove the later mounts? – Joyia (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: This is a tough one. On the one hand, we know there are a lot of players who would still like to get their hands on these mounts. On the other hand, we were pretty clear that they would only be available for a limited time, and we hate to go back on our word because we know some groups went through heroic efforts to get them before the door closed. This is the kind of thing that is not set in stone and player feedback might eventually convince us to change our minds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: The Achievement reward for “What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been” still remains as a purple proto-drake, which is a WotLK model. How about coordinating the color of the reward upon each expansion theme? – Shory (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: The issue with meta-achievements like this is deciding how to structure them for the future. Do current players with the achievement just get a new mount every expansion? Do the old mounts go away and the new mount replaces it? Do we require you to just do one additional holiday and now you can get a second mount? We added Long Strange Trip when achievements first went in the game, and we didn’t always do a great job of designing some achievements with expandability in mind. If we had made the Long Strange Trip reward a protodrake at level 80 and then had a new achievement for doing the holidays again at level 85 that rewarded a different drake, then we might have some easily expandable content. We didn’t do that though, and it’s hard to go back and mess with existing achievements, especially ones that were hard to complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: There are still no Achievements beyond “Collect 75 unique companion pets”. Can I expect a reward for 100 companion pets in the future? – Whitewnd (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: Patch 4.1 has achievements for 100 and 125 companions. Those particular achievements don’t reward pets, but we’ll probably do another reward at some tier in the future, perhaps 150 or 200 pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are we going to see more PvP achievements that reward mounts? Currently most of the cool mounts are awarded for PvE achievements. – Demodras (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: PvP achievements are even trickier to design than PvE achievements because it’s harder to come up with something cool to do that doesn’t make the experience worse for everyone else. You don’t want to see the one dude who is trying to engineer capturing and losing a flag twenty times in one BG just so he can get the achievement for capturing a lot of flags. As a result, many of the PvP achievements are just for winning a lot of Arenas or BGs, which we feel already come with a lot of rewards. On that note, we are adding unique ground mounts to winning Rated Battle Grounds similar to the flying mounts you get for excelling at Arenas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I woudn't be a fan of &quot;spending&quot; achievement points but if something was implemented like.. if you have 5000 achievement points you get a tabard that says just.. 5k on it, that'd be awesome. Something more special for higher achievement points like the over 9000 achievement, something that was removed with an expansion maybe or when a ton of new achievements come out, like they did with Ulduar&quot;<br />
<br />
No need to get angry over it though :D</div></div><hr />

Think of it this way, you were ALREADY going to fish out all of those fish to use for a fish feast to begin with, so why wouldnt it make sense to make the good recipie drop from fishing all those fish out?<br />
<br />
Its a win win situation for that guild achievement, the only thing that could be an issue is the amount of fish you needed to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the keys were deleted. The bit of the database that says &quot;You have this key&quot; is no longer there, so sending a search down the DB for &quot;people with X key&quot; won't work. So, no retroactive achievement.<br />
<br />
I mean they probably have DB backups, but that's a stupid amount of work for one FoS. And this is coming from a 6 times Keymaster.</div></div><hr />

I would not underestimate achievements and their contribution to subscriber retention.<br />
<br />
Achievements were a brilliant move by Blizzard to keep people toiling away at WoW during the later months of WotLK. A lot of people like collecting things. Some people are completionists. Others have OCD and achievements are an itch that need to be scratched. They added a new element to the game to keep people running on the hamster wheels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm hoping the &quot;maybe have more pet collecting achieves&quot; also applies to mount collecting achievements. I'll have 125 once Children's Week rolls around and a 125/150 achievement would make me really happy.</div></div><hr />

I hate not seeing something complete, and i agree with your statement, even though it describes people who actually go for achieves like rodents, I would watch your tone next time you speak..<br />
<br />
Other than that, ive kept myself busy even if its not achievement based, been collecting old armor sets and currently working on this vanilla green set from 50 rare spawns, will be interesting to see once its completed</div></div><hr />

I did not mean it as an insult. Objectively, a lot of things we do in WoW are grinds ... and a good visual for a grind is a hamster running on a wheel.<br />
<br />
Becoming bored with most aspects of WoW, I have turned to achievements, pet collecting, and mount collecting as ways to pass the time. Most of my WoW friends only log on during raid times these days, so I've had more time to devote to knocking out achievements.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. It's not like the feast is mandatory. I had 90 buff food for every raid before we got this achievement, and I have flasks every time even though we still don't have cauldrons. Maybe it's not so much the achievement being soul crushing as your guild not putting in enough effort or wanting rewards for being too casual to try.</div></div><hr />

I hope they keep focusing on getting the next tier of raiding out and not worry about a title that means nothing above someone head or pets,mounts and achievement points that will never be used for anything. Just like they dont put all of their time into pvp as it is a pve game with raiding obviously a larger part of the game thus more important.</div></div><hr />

simply for the fact that I have to go through demoralizing pvp scenario's just to earn rep for a faction makes me queasy on even trying to get those achis, hell, the What a Long, Strange Trip It's been achi was faster than that ever will be, since getting rep in WSG for the most part only occurs when someone drops/picks up/caps/ returns a flag, and no other time.<br />

I think the problem here lies in that recovering old information is hard to achieve, once it's removed. It's the same with anything about the internet or even any computer. Eventually, some information that was once stored there disappears, and then it is next to impossible to gain it back, simply because the data for it is lost. Of course, there are some programs that are able to recover such lost data, again, but then it needs to be able to go back to the time before it was removed, plus you can not go back how long you want, which makes it quite limiting and not all reliable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the idea of the other types of rewards being tied to achievements. Please keep these sort of items away from them in the future.<br />
The biggest problem with these achievements is that they don't scale with your guild size. So a 25 man raiding guild is going to have a much easier time getting these than a 10 man raiding guild will. It's a tough problem to solve because if it did scale to the guild size you'd just dump a bunch of people from the guild, complete the achievement and have them rejoin after.</div></div><hr />

I like that they want to make achievements account bound, even if it will take a long time.<br />
<br />
A nice question to have asked was if they ever considered adding more world events, or making achievements out of current world events. Darkmoon Faire is a great candidate for achievements, and being that its once a month not once a year they could get even more creative.<br />
<br />
Also no questions on statistics, I know not technically achievements but I would have loved to have had some insight on what they intend to do with them. (they said somewhere they have plans to revamp it)<br />
<br />
Otherwise I love achievements. Nothing better then feeling like you have completed an expansion once you have for example, Loremaster of Outland and all the Outland reps at Exalted.<br />

Some people play the game with millions of alts, but for people like me who just have one character who has walked through everything Azeroth has to offer, Achievements are great. It is another way to progress the game outside of PvE and PvP.</div></div><hr />

Any good raid guild will require you to have food and flasks just as part of being prepared. The &quot;good feast&quot; is no better than the Fortune Cookies or any other 90 stat food. The cauldrons are no better than flasks, they just allow each individual to spend/farm less. It's hardly a game breaker if you don't have them.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the lesser achievement that unlocks the small cauldrons is much easier than the second tier achievement for the big cauldrons. If the feast is hard to get, really, who cares? You shouldn't have anybody raiding who isn't capable of providing their own food, anyway.<br />

Umm, A Mask for All Occasions was removed from the meta in 3.0.2, and like all achievements, is OPTIONAL. You want &quot;completely ridiculous?&quot; Go grind out Insane in the Membrane.<br />

<br />
Its a win win situation for that guild achievement, the only thing that could be an issue is the amount of fish you needed to begin with.<br />
<br />
This would be a perfect argument to the hatred of that Guild Achievement IF the achievement didn't require that you fish all 10,000 fish from pools. Had the achievement simply been &quot;Fish up 10,000 Fish from Cataclysm Zones&quot; that would have been much better. But as 2 of the 3 fish for the feast are actually fished from Open Water (or Lava), and much of the 90 stat food fish that gets used is also fished from Open Water and not Pools, it made this achievement rather tedious.<br />
<br />
Only reason we got it is because the people in our guild that still haven't managed to fish up that blasted Turtle migrated from Northrend down into the Cata zones and started farming for it there. BTW, none of us got the damned thing before we got the Achievement.<br />

<br />
By &quot;pretty clear&quot; they mean &quot;We gave you a month and half notice when we announced it in the upcoming patch, so those of you who by then were bored waiting for new content and couldn't get your guildies back on to get the achievements in time got boned. We also failed to make it clear whether the Ulduar drakes would be removed or not and so everyone ground the ever living crap out of those achievements before we gave a yay or nay on if we'd take them out.&quot;<br />

Had the achievement simply been &quot;Fish up 10,000 Fish from Cataclysm Zones&quot; that would have been much better. But as 2 of the 3 fish for the feast are actually fished from Open Water (or Lava), and much of the 90 stat food fish that gets used is also fished from Open Water and not Pools, it made this achievement rather tedious.<br />
<br />
Only reason we got it is because the people in our guild that still haven't managed to fish up that blasted Turtle migrated from Northrend down into the Cata zones and started farming for it there. BTW, none of us got the damned thing before we got the Achievement.<br />
<br />
I run a small 10 man weekend guild where 5 of the cores are raiding with other guilds during the week and 3 of them are on other servers. The other 5 are myself and 4 other guys that don't really have a lot of time during the week to raid. We got this achievement within 2 month's time simply by coordinating it with everyone not raiding elsewhere and taking little bites out of it. I also stopped supplying the foods people wanted during the raids. In the end, it worked out better. I stockpiled all the Fathom Eel and Highland Guppy during this time so all we need from time to time is Lavascale. And I have full guild tabs of either fish still. <br />
<br />
True, this isn't a necessity but it makes it so much easier and I can guarantee we're at 90/90 buffs. If 5 guys can fish up 10,000 fish, then everyone is obviously doing it wrong or is flat out not committed to the cause and wants things handed to them. Gimme a break. And I also got 3 turtles on the various alts I took out to go fishing after they implemented it.</div></div><hr />

My guild recently imploded due to various reasons, and most of my friends either transfered off or stopped logging in, leaving one or two of us feeling rather alone. I have friends on another realm because my old vanilla guild started playing again after cataclysm, and I've leveled my oldest main up to 85 and started grinding heroics to catch up.<br />
<br />
However, every time I get an achievement on that char, it's almost nauseating to think that &quot;yeah, just another 8000 achievement points to catch up..&quot; to my other character(s). Where I'm going with this is, I shouldn't have to grind (actually, I refuse to, I'd rather quit) the same achievements on all my characters, or &quot;abandon&quot; several hundred days played on another character. It's not &quot;Rageudder&quot; the warrior that has completed (or is near to complete) several of the raiding meta achievements, all the world event achievements as well as most of the general, all of the reputation and many of the loremaster achievements. It's me. The real live person controlling these puppets, and therefore I believe that achievements should be account wide, regardless of where *I* play.</div></div><hr />

Q: Will you ever bring back the mounts for achievements that were removed (Naxx Glory runs) as you didn't remove the later mounts? – Joyia (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: This is a tough one. On the one hand, we know there are a lot of players who would still like to get their hands on these mounts. On the other hand, we were pretty clear that they would only be available for a limited time, and we hate to go back on our word because we know some groups went through heroic efforts to get them before the door closed. This is the kind of thing that is not set in stone and player feedback might eventually convince us to change our minds.<br />
<br />
<br />
By &quot;pretty clear&quot; they mean &quot;We gave you a month and half notice when we announced it in the upcoming patch, so those of you who by then were bored waiting for new content and couldn't get your guildies back on to get the achievements in time got boned. We also failed to make it clear whether the Ulduar drakes would be removed or not and so everyone ground the ever living crap out of those achievements before we gave a yay or nay on if we'd take them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
I vote we start feebacking the hell out of Blizzard to get them back.<br />
<br />

&quot;Will we ever see a change to the Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin exalted achievement /reputation grinds?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think those are fine as achievements. They definitely take a huge time commitment, but so do some of the other achievements. And you don’t need to get them for the meta achievements.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That is BULL. Do they even realize they removed the rep tokens? Or are they that stupid that they didn't even bother to check WoWHead before converting everything to just honor. You know, WoWHead, the third-party website that's 1000% better than any official information resource Blizzard has ever produced.<br />
<br />
If *ANYONE* from Blizzard had bothered to check WoWHead, they would discover that they removed the ability to purchase Silverwing/Arathi rep with WSG/AB tokens. The tokens are gone. It used to be that if you lost a match, you got one token. Winning it was three or something. So yes, winning more rounds got you faster rep (which is as it should be). At the same time, playing at all gave you a shot at eventually getting the same rep.<br />
<br />
Now? You can play an entire round and have people so bad on your team that you get 0 rep. Zero. For a match that could last 15 minutes. This isn't &quot;a huge time commitment&quot; it's borderline The Insane achievement. Someone calculated that you'd have to capture 1200 flags to get exalted. Over 30 games played for Alliance, I got 20 flags worth of rep. So basically that's something like playing WSG non-stop eight hours a day for something like half a year. It takes LESS time to get every Argent Tournament mount.<br />
<br />
If they had rep tokens in the first place, MAYBE THERE WAS A REASON. If they removed them, MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE BUMPED THE ACTION REP. It's not enough to just say &quot;oh it's no longer part of the meta&quot; because it's also part of Justicar and Exalted and make these two formerly doable reps nearly impossible. Stupid stupid stupid. The developers just prove how clueless and out of touch they are when they brush it off concerns like that. I'm 100% sure they aren't even aware they broke the rep because, again, they know less than a third-party fan website does.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but you're just as dumb as Blizzard. I had &quot;The Exalted&quot; before I got Justicar. Hell, I didn't even have the guild bonus of 10% rep. They aren't nearly impossible.

There are 3 classic PvP reps. It took me one holiday weekend to get AV to exalted. One weekend. Versus 180 days to get either of the other two. How does that make any sense in your universe? How is saying &quot;Blizzard, fix your bug&quot; being entitled?<br />

Do the math, or stop being ignorant and go read the facts over on WoWHead. You obviously got it done before they removed rep tokens. Good for you, you want a cookie? You are bad at PvP and just AFK'd your way to exalted, I get it. I don't think it's too much to ask to either a) give other players a shot at those two reps or b) give players something a lot better than what you got, because they'd actually have to be good at PvP to get it now.</div></div><hr />

Clearly, it isn't a bug if they are accepting of the general design philosophy that they used. Obviously they have developers in the game who use BGs, and they have playtesters who have gone through Rated BGs constantly, and through all of that, they haven't augmented the rep system. Perhaps it's the case that while they are not bothered by the rep gain involved in Alterac Valley, the time associated with Arath Basin and Warsong Gulch balance it out in their eyes. <br />
<br />
By the way, it is quite clear that I am god awful at PvP, considering I have the Justicar and you do not, and in several of the BGs, I was the one that was assaulting the base for the victory, or returning flag for the cap. But hey, by all means you can call me a botter next for having something that you don't, and certainly not by planning and hard work. That'd be pants-on-head retarded, AMIRITE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a win win situation for that guild achievement, the only thing that could be an issue is the amount of fish you needed to begin with.<br />
<br />
The problem with the fishing achievement is that only fish caught in pools count, but one of the only fish worth fishing for, deepsea sagefish, only drops from open water. Pretty much any other stat food has a land-based alternative, but for casters the only intellect food available is severed sagefish head. So anyone going out to farm those fish won't be contributing to the guild achievement. And when two food items have the same stats and you can get one faster from killing a bunch of dragons instead of fishing from pools, no one bothers to go fish.<br />
<br />
On another note, no rewards for 100 or 125 pets? FUCK THAT. 125 pets aren't obtained overnight by casuals, only collectors bother going that high! And we get nothing to show for that time and effort?

The problem is they don't actually want to answer anything fully because in game development, things change -- okay, that's fine. On top of that, they have a timeline of when they announce stuff... so unless they choose to announce it during Q&amp;A, things won't get announced early.<br />

Rep/Justicar changed in the token-&gt;honor conversion towards the end of Wrath. Someone who started just a month before that could have gotten it. You aren't a special snowflake because you got it midway through TBC when it was still easy.<br />

<br />
Clearly you aren't a developer nor do you work for Blizzard so clearly you are an idiot for speaking for them. Blizzard is well known for their oversights and lack of testing. Or is it &quot;clearly not a bug&quot; that this year's Love is in the Air cards were signed Magni despite the fact that he's no longer in the throne room? Or that you couldn't even pick up the IF/TB quests? They aren't &quot;radical new design philosophies&quot;. They are just examples a company with ones of the worst Q&amp;A departments (however, that is the general trend of the gaming industry as a whole).<br />
<br />
Not once in any thread about the missing rep tokens has any blue or dev said &quot;that is intended&quot;. Instead, the focus has been, several times on &quot;we removed it from the meta&quot; without comment on the issue that previously you could get all three exalted + Justicar in a single week of grinding and now, suddenly post-honor convertion, it's 6 months. That's a sudden 180-degree departure from the stated practice of making things easier over time. Example: Easier Exalted nerf. Easier The Insane nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, it is quite clear that I am god awful at PvP, considering I have the Justicar and you do not, and in several of the BGs, I was the one that was assaulting the base for the victory, or returning flag for the cap.

You are not special because you did it when it was trivial. You could AFK through a weekend of BGs and have it. You want to impress me? Link me the armory for any character made after the honor conversion that has it. Hell, link me ANY Alliance character made after the honor conversion that has it. I haven't seen one.<br />

But as 2 of the 3 fish for the feast are actually fished from Open Water (or Lava), and much of the 90 stat food fish that gets used is also fished from Open Water and not Pools, it made this achievement rather tedious.<br />

Actually, that's reversed. Fathom Eel pools in Uldum and TB, Highland Guppy pools in TH. Only one is open-water/lava.<br />

Maybe if you explain to your casters that if they contribute to the achievement and get the fish feasts, they no longer have to gamble with open water fishing... It really doesn't take too much effort. The first 6000 fish were done by myself and another guildy over the course of a couple weeks, we did a tournament with blood pools in Borean Tundra for another 3000 or so and another guildy got the last sum the following night into the next morning. People just have to pitch in for the achievement so they can reap the benefit later.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if you're just honestly this dumb, or if you're quite possibly one of the best trolls I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY MANY MMO YEARS, but the honor conversion taking out the marks wasn't when they changed the mark-turn-in for rep. That was gone at the start of Burning Crusade.<br />

Either you're just completely clueless, or you are knowingly taking misinformation and spreading it as though it was the truth--wait, are you Senator Kyl?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly you aren't a developer nor do you work for Blizzard so clearly you are an idiot for speaking for them. Blizzard is well known for their oversights and lack of testing. Or is it &quot;clearly not a bug&quot; that this year's Love is in the Air cards were signed Magni despite the fact that he's no longer in the throne room? Or that you couldn't even pick up the IF/TB quests? They aren't &quot;radical new design philosophies&quot;. They are just examples a company with ones of the worst Q&amp;A departments (however, that is the general trend of the gaming industry as a whole).<br />
<br />
Not once in any thread about the missing rep tokens has any blue or dev said &quot;that is intended&quot;. Instead, the focus has been, several times on &quot;we removed it from the meta&quot; without comment on the issue that previously you could get all three exalted + Justicar in a single week of grinding and now, suddenly post-honor conversion, it's 6 months. That's a sudden 180-degree departure from the stated practice of making things easier over time. Example: Easier Exalted nerf. Easier The Insane nerf.<br />
<br />
The &quot;insane nerf&quot; wasn't really a nerf--they removed the Shen'dralar reputation from the game alltogether. In fact, they were going to remove &quot;The Insane&quot; alltogether, grandfathering in those that already had it, but the populace begged them to keep it in because so many were so very close to the Feat of Strength. <br />
<br />
On the topic of their internal testing, you clearly have no knowledge of what a &quot;bug&quot; is. Zarhym posted again on the Question and Answer that they are completely satisfied with the length it takes to achieve Justicar. Furthermore, the fact that &quot;OMG MAGNI SIGNED THE CARD&quot; is probably one of the most infinitesimally small, trivial things that could possibly matter in the course of the game. Q&amp;A is far more busy tracking down exploits, hacks, and genuine-game-ruining bugs than something as unbelievably dumb as &quot;omg look who's name is on this card&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Given that I had never tried to get it, I googled a rep guide which mentioned marks, saw vendor mentioned was gone, went to WoWHead to find new vendor/replacement, and either the comment was worded wrong or I misunderstood and thought the vendor had been removed in the honor conversion. Given that the mounts migrated to a new vendor and the tabards migrated to a new vendor, it made sense that the marks disappeared at the same time. If I'm wrong then, it probably wasn't an oversight.<br />

<br />
The Insane nerf was a HUGE nerf. Shen'dralar were one of the hardest and most expensive factions to get exalted. Pristine black diamonds were ass impossible to farm. When they showed up on the AH they often sold for 2K. Other items like blood of heroes was soulbound and had to be farmed. Regardless of what you contend, anyone with The Insane post Shattering did not have to do nearly as much work as someone Pre-Shattering. That's a huge nerf. I notice you did not take the opportunity to point out an example of an achievement/title getting significantly harder.<br />

Again, no Blue has ever posted why the marks were removed or why they can't be readded. If I'm wrong about the timing of when they were removed, OK, fair enough. But my point remains it wasn't originally nearly as hard, and is dramatically different than comparable reputations. I'd really like to know if Zarhym even knows how long it actually takes to get Justicar, or if he did it once in vanilla and hasn't bothered to investigate. Who knows.<br />
<br />
And I'd say the fact that people couldn't get Love Fool/Love is in the Air completed because Cairn and Magni --the quest givers-- were no longer in the game counts a game-ruining bug. The fact that they hotfixed it within a few days shows it was definitely a serious bug. But the fact that nobody at Blizzard apparently thought to ask &quot;You know, since we are removing Magni and Cairn, do you think we should check what quests they have?&quot; Derp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gunna call bullshit on this. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't all of those keys gained via questing? Every quest a player completes is back-catalogued. Not hard to track. Chalk it up to laziness.</div></div><hr />

Sucks that after ages grinding outland rep and doing stupid jousting quests each day to get a unique tabard, it's now become a joke tabard anyone can get just from buying tabards from vendors. <br />

Why didn't they change the achievement like the &quot;The Exalted&quot; title? QQ</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a win win situation for that guild achievement, the only thing that could be an issue is the amount of fish you needed to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you actually farm this or are you just talking air here? As a 10man guild, we farmed it. We actually had to buy a new tab for all the fish we in the end had. We had enough mats for tons, tons, tons of feast. Only now, 2 months after, are we finally running out of only 1 kind of fish needed. It's a ridiculous achievement, and it's really mandatory for any guild that takes itself seriously. I remember guildies stayed up until 4 AM fishing fishing fishing. I was sick at this time and when I woke up I wondered why my fiancee was still up. So I logged in on my laptop and helped them out at 4 AM. Fishing. Fishing. Fishing. We haven't fished since, because nobody wants to ever see a fishing pole again. Not that we needed to with the 3 GBtabs FULL of fish.<br />
<br />
The majority of the achievement was done by 2 people, and in the end 5 guildies worked on it. Small guilds suffer from achievements like this - but even bigger ones do: I know of guilds that grant their members DKP or promises of loot or gold for fishing X amounts of fish for the achievement too (I know because we've actually been griefed a few times by such guilds during the fishing). I don't think this is the &quot;design intent&quot;, is it.</div></div><hr />

Only one toon on the server may have the title, which is automatically removed and reassigned when the record has been beaten. For example &quot;Master/Mistress of Elements&quot; for the character that dealt the single largest elemental-based damage on the server, or &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; for the character with the most total dungeon runs.<br />
<br />
These server-wide titles would be akin to professional belts transferred from one winner to the next, granting only bragging rights to the current winner.<br />
<br />

<br />
A few quick Server titles I thought of...<br />
<br />
Master Baiter - Most fish landed<br />
the Tired - most steps taken<br />
Caregiver - most hitpoints healed (would need to somehow exclude overheals to prevent spam healing during downtime but should include heals from any source incl. bandages)<br />
the Careful - fewest deaths (perhaps 1 title per level or only awarded to current maximum level)</div></div><hr />

Sorry, no. Any guild that takes itself seriously has raiders that can provide themselves with exactly the same buffs from non feast/cauldron items. This is merely a convenience, and I like that blizz actually made folks work for it.</div></div><hr />
