Blue posts<br />
We've got a lot of posts related to WotLK today and also a small mention of Patch 2.4.3 by Slouken, the last time we heard about it was more than a month ago and I guess it wouldn't be surprising to see it very soon on PTRs.<br />
Patch 2.4.3 Mentioned again<br />
Yes, this is already fixed for 2.4.3. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7116597659&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#9))<br />

Wrath of the Lich King - Item Changes<br />
Something to keep in mind is that there was a change in item setup in The Burning Crusade to where you saw a lot more stamina on basically everything. In Wrath of the Lich King we don't currently plan to rework an entire statistic like that, so instead the items will just get more powerful at a more consistent rate. Of course anything can still change so we'll have to see how things turn out. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7116397726&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#28))<br />

Wrath of the Lich King Graphics Upgrade<br />
We have some really amazing graphics and textures going in with Wrath of the Lich King. I believe the art team is really outdoing themselves as have all of the teams developing the expansion. We are still retaining the style that makes Warcraft, well, Warcraft, but hopefully you'll enjoy the newer elements that are being added in and the design of Northrend.

Wrath of the Lich King System Requirements<br />
I know this question has come up before when we were releasing Burning Crusade, but we don't have any information at present on any changes to the minimum requirements for Wrath of the Lich King . Provided there are any changes, we'll let you know, but we do our best to maintain the availability of the game for as many people as possible.

Will we see Heroic versions of low-level old world dungeons like Shadowfang Keep in the future ?<br />
We currently have no plans to implement this. Whether we made them tuned for level 70s or 80s they would be left behind again at some point but don't get me wrong, it's a fun idea, it's just that right now we are focusing on all the dungeons we are adding in Wrath of the Lich King, their regular and heroic versions, along with the dual setup of 10 and 25 person versions for each of the raid dungeons.

WotLK Closed Beta Questions<br />
Nethaera answered a few questions related to the closed beta of Wrath of the Lich King. Keep in mind that there isn't any closed beta of WotLK for the moment, any mail promising you a beta account is a scam. <br />
How do you choose people who will participate in the beta ? <br />
We generally pull from many places so that we have a good variety of people in the beta. Some of it is random and some are winners from contests, or specific groups that we want to pull from. We don't have a specific schedule for you on who we will pull in or when to share with you, but we'll do what we can to keep people as informed as possible.<br />
<br />
Is there a minimum level of experience/total time played that we would need to be considered for the beta?<br />
There is no minimum level of experience needed since we look at a broad spectrum of testers. We want people of all experience levels to be able to share their experiences with us so that we know where we might need to work on something more. We don't necessarily want to make one aspect too hard or too easy on either end of things. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7116598081&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#18))<br />
<br />
Will there be some sort of application process to at least show interest in beta testing? If its completely random, what happens if you pick someone who isn't even interested?<br />
Undetermined on the first question and it will most likely be the same as with any beta someone gets and isn't interested in, they just won't play it. We watch our numbers, we see if we have the beta testers we need, and if we need more, we get more people in.<br />
It's all dependent on what the development team feel they want to have tested and where the focus is. We could have specific things we want players to test, or we could just want to load things up and stress it.

Later updated with ...<br />
I just thought I'd update this thread with a little extra information to let people know that there will be a sign up process when it comes time for the beta as well.<br />
<br />
Please note that that time is not now. Please be aware that there are some scams currently running that are asking people to sign up for Wrath. We will let everyone know when it is time to sign up.

Battleground Queue System<br />
The fact of the matter is that the queue system has been altered over the years since the implementation of Battlegrounds to be the most convenient to the most players with regards to selecting one's preferred Battleground, as well as the amount of time one must wait before entering a match.<br />
<br />
An equal number of players from each faction at the top of the respective queues are selected at the launch of the Battleground. Each player selected is given a grace period to enter the match before they are automatically removed from the queue. The issue you're describing is a result of players not entering the match when selected, and not leaving the queue before this grace period ends. By the time new players from the top of the queue are offered the chance to join the match, it has already begun. Most of you understand this; I only mention this to acknowledge the primary cause of the situation discussed in this thread.<br />
<br />
It can be very demoralizing when one team is forced to begin a battle with less members than the opposing team. I've been there and experienced that first-hand many times over.<br />
<br />
There are inherent issues with both leaving the queue system as it is, and imposing further requirements before a match begins. For instance, if we keep the match from starting until each side has an equal number of players, everyone is forced to wait beyond the actual queue time to ensure enough players have accepted to enter the match.<br />
<br />
The choice may well be between suspending a match indefinitely until both teams have the same number of players; and starting a match lopsided so players can get through the match and carry on with their gaming. I suspect not everyone would have the same preference given this choice, and the difference could greatly impact the style, reason, and enjoyment of the Battlegrounds for many.<br />
<br />
That said, we aren't completely satisfied with the queue system as it stands.<br />

Also this Queue thing, while they have never changed their stance on what causes it, why does it only ever affect Horde in my BG? I don't think I have ever seen Alliance complain about it either. Somebody should do a study as to why Horde players refuse to click &quot;Join&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Their cause is just a big lie. The real reason is that this problem started to occur after they implemented their fix for shorter queue times.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have 100 alliance and 60 horde in queue for WSG, they start 10 WSG with 10 to 6 ratio.<br />
This is also why queue times for horde on alliance dominated battlegroups has increased from instant queue to 3-8min.<br />
<br />
Saying that horde are causing it by not accepting the bg invitation is wrong.</div></div><hr />

wow have you ever noticed the amount of people that join the bg right after it starts? the queue time to join the bg is 2min....the start time before the bg is what? 2min!! so if someone doesn't take the queue the new people can't get in till after the bg has already started. unless they leave their queue early which most people don't...they just let it run out. Blizzard should just make the bg queue time the same as arena cept leave the 2min start timer. So there'll be twice the chance everyone will join before the bg actually starts. 1min timers for bg queues....seriously the blizzard development team needs to look at simpler solutions instead of making it more complicated. sometimes the easiest solution could be the best =/</div></div><hr />

I've noticed people joining almost instantly after the match begins. The BG join window expires in 2min and the BG starts in 2min. It’s not going to allow another player to join till the original player join window has expired. It’s not hard to imagine a player afking when the window pops or letting their join window sit till expires because they are considering using it as an escape to get them out of a BG that has turned south. <br />
<br />
If you have solid proof that blizzards statement is a lie then please show us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on our Battlegroup (umm i forget the name) its not unusual to see a side with less players.. happens often on both sides.... probably 25% of bg's start with less horde than alliance, and another 25% start with less alliance than horde.. this isn't always a big deal as the BG fills up within 2-4 minutes after it starts...</div></div><hr />

Every other game, they get testers based on experience with the game and don't randomly select scrubs or noobs that have no clue how to &quot;test&quot; a game. With a game like WoW blizzard NEEDS to invite dedicated testers and have requirements to test WOTLK, not throw out or give out random closed beta invites because they have an account. Go on Cenarius Alliance Trade channel.... enough proof you dont give out random invites.<br />
