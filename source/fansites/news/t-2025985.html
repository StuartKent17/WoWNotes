Getting a key is my only chance to play a DH until about October and I've been dying to see the experience. I have to go take care of my ailing grandfather since my dad can't do it anymore and that happens Aug 1st, so. <br />
<br />
Here's to hoping.</div></div><hr />

The pets you need to beat are mostly Level 1. Everyone with a max garrison got a free Level 25 pet. Not super challenging.</div></div><hr />

Read above. All it takes is a level 1 pet in each major city and if you have a mage you can be done in 5 mins. SOOOOOO HARD. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

shh, less people who enter means more chances for us to win. :)<br />
but seriously, these have all been ridiculously easy. It's just a matter of making you put for a literal 5-10 minutes of effort to show you want something and to participate in the community.</div></div><hr />

It will literally take you 5-10 minutes and you just need level 1 pets (which you should have plenty of them just from playing the game).<br />

A Beta key isn't worth 5-10 minutes of your time? Yikes.</div></div><hr />

You make it sound like its a guarantee beta key (which obviously is not). You also underestimate how much people hate the pet system. Like how I refused to do the streamer event because I think streamers are a plague upon society.<br />

<br />
Even if you did, you cant expect a key either. They are not guaranteed. How hard is that to understand? Doing something you hate for a chance is not worth it for a lot of people. Especially when you take into account pre-patch and release are just around the corner. I know for the streamer event, I had chosen to wait for pre-patch and legion instead of getting involved with that event. Was not worth my time.<br />

&lt;Illidian&gt;You would be Prepared&lt;/Illidian&gt;<br />
<br />
Plan out your leveling strat, read the lore, so that you can get ahead when it happens. Also, you have a better chance to test out other classes at level 100 if you were thinking of switching.</div></div><hr />

Beta can and has run until a week before a new expansion releases iirc. Certainly wont end with pre-patch though.</div></div><hr />

Haha. There will be at least 5000 bot entrants. All with accounts created in July. They will win about 725 of the keys. Then they'll be on ebay or other sites shortly after for sale.</div></div><hr />

I know right? Such entitlement because they refused to enter a contest that could give them a chance of getting a key by doing something they don't like. Such entitlement. Not like they know they have no chance at all by not entering. Such entitlement :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I bitched about the streaming event but never felt entitled. I dont see any comments of people demanding a key for doing nothing (minus the &quot;loyal&quot; ones but they are in EVERY giveaway, not unique to this one).</div></div><hr />

Well, that's not correct, I have the battlenet account connected to Wowhead and today, to mmo-champion. I have been playing not since long, that's true, but it's enough time to be the worth owner of a beta key. My mean is not to bot the giveaway just have a chance, like everybody of win it and not sell it like other pieces of crap. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Week 2 was the easiest and quickest with posting a screenshot. You underestimate the hate people have for pet battles. Only reason I entered is because I already have it. I hate pokemon, FF, anything turn based like that when it comes to video games, but thought I would give it a fair chance first.</div></div><hr />

Yeah if past prepatches are anything to go by it'll land on the 19th for the US and 20th for EU, With this contest ending on the 15th that's ~4 days of Beta lol</div></div><hr />

That's not 4 days of beta. Beta you get to play stuff for the Legion expansion not the pre-expansion. So you will get to play new stuff for over a month yet before it comes out. Beta won't end until close to when Legion goes live.</div></div><hr />

Eh, the critters in cities are usually just simple stuff like rats-- so its not a big difficulty barrier in the content. Now if its just something that doesn't appeal to you thats dif, but at least its not 'go fight that uber-trainer on this mountain top with his legendary poodle' kind of achieve.<br />

No shit, I have beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you will get to play new stuff for over a month yet before it comes out. Beta won't end until close to when Legion goes live.<br />
Prepatch means a fair amount of things to do, Relearning some classes, Farming the invasion ensembles / gear for alts, Broken Shore event, Getting Demon Hunters prepped for Legion launch.<br />
<br />
I probably won't even login to Beta after the prepatch hits.</div></div><hr />

I don't like the idea of burning myself out on the content before the expansion is even released yet. Plus, all your progress on the Beta doesn't transfer to the live game.</div></div><hr />

Then you know it's more than 4 days of beta!! lol<br />
<br />
The Tmog and class changes are the only thing that starts right away with the prepatch, Blizz stated the invasions, Broken shore event and Demon hunters will be later. Demon hunters being the last thing they let go live on the prepatch. Just bc you probably wont log into Beta doesn't mean that's how everyone feels. Mostly those of us that have crappy luck and haven't been able to get into the beta at all yet.<br />

Ya some people are like that and that's fine. I myself would still like to get on the beta to find out where certain things are learn the new dungeons so i can help my guildies with it when they go live , etc<br />

Does this mean all 750 winners have been selected and are waiting for the 72h window to collect their keys, if they don't collect it new ones will be chosen, or is it a continuous thing than happens?</div></div><hr />

Winners are still being selected means exactly what it says. If you had lost it would tell you. They haven't picked the winners yet though so just relax and check back in a few hours. Maybe do something out of the house on a Saturday...</div></div><hr />

I make no assumption. I quote this from the original contest text: &quot;Winners will be selected by July 16&quot;<br />
<br />
It's July 16th. Winners are still being selected. No need for impatience.</div></div><hr />

As pet battle achievements are mostly account wide, this one in particular, it is impossible for anyone (myself included) to go earn them again on an alt or otherwise. <br />
<br />
I only mention this because logging in with Battle.net to MMO-C doesn't give me credit for doing the achievement and having tried several ways to do it again (each time waiting patiently to log out, wait 5 min, click update, wait 5 min, refresh) and still can't get the contest to notice me. :(<br />
<br />
Never updated in time for me :(</div></div><hr />

I suggest you don't sell the key and instead give it away to someone else ( Could be me, got a bunch of time and just finished watching Game of Thrones so got nothing to do at the moment ) But you should defo not sell it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggest you don't try to sell it on here. You're going to get a lot of flack from people. Not gonna lie even I'm annoyed with that sort of behavior. All of us want the beta key to get in so you'll get hated by people if you try and sell it.</div></div><hr />
