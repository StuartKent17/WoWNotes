Vengeance Hotfix<br />
A hotfix will be applied to adjust how Vengeance stacks for tanks of all classes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Vengeance should now ramp up more quickly. Avoidance will now grant Vengeance based on the average damage of the avoided NPC auto-attack, instead of just refreshing existing Vengeance. This does not apply to enemy special attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
This will be noted in the next hotfix update, but we wanted to let you know immediately, as this change will be applied sometime today.</div></div><hr />

You should get your facts straight :)<br />
<br />
Buffing everyone while making a few minor things better, doesnt make something worse. It still makes DK's better, it just benefit avoidance stackers slightly more.<br />
<br />
Fact is: Vengeance will be better than before, so dk's will be better.</div></div><hr />

This change is an addition to how Vengeance works. Previous you would potentially lose an increase to your Vengeance by increasing your avoidance (parry/dodge). Avoided damage is damage not taken, damage that was not increasing your Vengeance. Absorbs are not &quot;Avoidance.&quot; Now an increase to your avoidance (gear upgrade) doesn't potentially cost you increases for your Vengeance stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lmfao, maybe you're the one who needs to &quot;L2Read&quot;<br />
<br />
No where did it say anything about not being able to have over 100k AP or that they capped anything...<br />
Then you go and bold random parts of the sentence that has nothing to do with what you're talking about...<br />
<br />
Maybe you should try reading this again, but this time bold will now grant Vengeance and instead of just refreshing existing<br />
<br />
so, something that used to just refresh the current vengeance, will now give vengeance.<br />
<br />
Yup, you're right, guess they did nerf it and cap it... /sigh... Now I see why people at Blizzard have been dumbing down the game the past 4 years...</div></div><hr />

Not this month. You can only have so many scroll of wisdom to make the cards and they aren't in the greatest supply at the moment. The inks aren't exactly what are causing the high prices.</div></div><hr />

you mean 268k (blood ftw) oh and btw on bosses i pull 40-50k dps as it as tanks, and this is supposed to make dks better now when i outdamage most tanks anyways? lol can't wait to start outdpsing dpses again. dks are supposed to stack mastery but i go for avoidance anyways, from the math i've done stam/avoidance outdoes flat mastery, i was always thinking bout gemming mastery/stam but eh i don't take too much spike damage at all so far so until some boss beats me to a pulp i see no reason to change my set up</div></div><hr />

There is no need to post in such a way to put others down. I'm a healer and can acknoweledge how vengeance is alot stronger in MoP compared to Cata.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To clarify, avoidance was already helping vengeance, it wouldn't fall off, it would just refresh. So now by adding average damage, rather than refreshing as if it was previous damage, you might have higher vengeance for a bit, but the hit you took 19 seconds ago is about to lose its contribution to your vengeance.</div></div><hr />

Nowhere does it mention or even imply a vengeance cap. If anything, this is a buff to vengeance. Vengeance is supposed to be something like damage taken in the last 20 seconds will add attack power with a bandaid in place to frontload some of the AP from recent damage. If you dodged or parried an attack, then you took less damage, and hence have receive less AP. Now that it's counting dodged and parried attacks, you have even more recent damage to increase your vengeance.</div></div><hr />

Yeah except if as a guardian you use savage defense at the start (and who wouldn't) which means under the current model you would be refreshing a very very low stack of vengeance over and over.</div></div><hr />

Your statement would hold ground if we would write the year 2005. <br />
<br />
The only skill a tank needs is the ability not to over-pull, now, 3-4 months down the road, you'll be able to pull 5 packs with no consequences like in the last 2 expansions. And even that skill, is not utilized in raids, since you don't have to bother about pack placements most of the time. <br />
<br />
Tanking was harder back in the day, now the only thing that I would consider hard while tanking is trying to find a position where the huge bosses don't block all your vision, especially if the ceiling is super low. I do however agree that the big numbers cause of vengeance do feel nice, even tho we really don't do anything for it, just as DPS don't do much for theirs. <br />
<br />
Playing a warrior tank since Feb, 2005 I think the hardest class to play is a healer, not because it's hard to click on bars, but because it can be stressful, split-second decision making, it's more stressful as tanking or DPSing, and especially at the start of an expansion healers get to adopt the most and have to deal with the biggest problems that is called mana regen and that allows no mistakes what so ever in their gameplay.</div></div><hr />

there will be very few circumstances where this is actually a DPS increase for tanks</div></div><hr />

Before this change, whenever you avoid an attack your vengeance buff is refreshed but not added to. After the change it is both refreshed and added to. Obvious buff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warlink</div><div class="date">2012-10-09, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vengeance is not being buffed, it's being smoothened. In Mogu'shan Vaults (and upcoming raids) many fights have tank swapping mechanics. After taunt avoidance streak could mean that you have zero vengeance and dps or the old tank could very easily pull aggro. And in 5 man content where vengeance drops between packs and avoidance streaks are bad for the tank and overly eager dps. Vengeance is being averaged out, not buffed or nerfed.</div></div><hr />

I want to know the answer to this as well. I really hope this isn't a &quot;oops, we forgot to put it in even though we just announced it yesterday&quot;.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You tanks&quot; shouldn't be top DPS, AT ALL. Single target, AoE, Abraham Lincoln, whatever. They need to put some kind of short ICD on Vengeance stacking so you don't gain astronomically more from multiple sources. The &quot;gain&quot; in DPS from AoE (and I use the term loosely here because it's rather hard for most DPS to do more AoE than single-target currently, unless they want to have no cooldowns for boss pulls) should come from using your attacks effectively, not because you gain hundreds of thousands of attack power from pulling a bunch of mobs.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Hubby's prot Pali shouldn't be capable of outdoing my hunter on aoe but he can, relatively easily. We've even played around with me switching specs just to see difference. End result is same. He's routinely pulled over 100k on pulls and I'm talking 5 mans with no raid gear and only partial heroic gear. Even he said he's cringing about the incoming nerfbat.</div></div><hr />

Looks like Blizzard screwed up and didn't implement it. Nethaera from the battle.net forums said &quot;Just as an fyi, I'm looking to get an answer for everyone. I'll let you know when I find out something more to share.&quot;<br />

<br />
I see this QQ all the time when i am doing 150k AOE DPS+ or 50k Single Target DPS. Most of the time its just players who can't play or who are under-geared or ungemmed not hit capped etc etc. My guild mates who play the class's they use very well have no issues with DPS and out doing me on the meters. Its just the people who can't play who feel cheated that's all.<br />
<br />
Learn to play your class and sort your kit out and you will do the same or more DPS than the tank at least single target anyway.</div></div><hr />

What did you expect guys? You all should know by now that blizzard devs are big time slackers.<br />
I mean seriously the game is in fucking bad shape. Bugs on back of bugs and now this.<br />
We are still unable to trade ink of dreams at vendors.<br />
<br />
I pay monthly fee for playing this game as you all do. I want it to work properly.</div></div><hr />
