Guild: Realm First! Working as a Team<br />
Archaeology is a requirement for the Guild Achievement Working as a Team. It's incorrectly not shown on the criteria list, which is a bug, and will be fixed in a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/143685/realm-first-working-as-a-team-removed))<br />
<br />
Hotfixes Unpredictability<br />
Applying a hotfix is a complicated process that involves many different developers, including in this case designers, QA and server programmers. These changes are applied live, which is a very different scenario than when things are changed for an upcoming build. We still make our best efforts to coordinate our list of hotfixes with the actual hotfixed data. In this case they were made within a few hours of each other. It takes time to track the progress of all of the hotfixes being developed, as we cannot announce them until we receive confirmation that the hotfixes have been tested by QA and pushed live by our programmers. While this whole process is taking place, we're compiling a large list of all of the changes made each day so we can update players in as timely a fashion as possible. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/143288/holy-paladin-nerfs))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
Holy Paladin Nerf<br />
It is intended that Protector of the Innocent and Light of Dawn transfer healing through Beacon of Light. Furthermore, we didn’t feel that changing either of those would have fixed the problem. When we looked at the numbers, paladins were getting far more Holy Power from Holy Light using Tower of Radiance than we had predicted they would. This wasn’t a problem of paladins topping healing meters or anything like that. The problem was that paladins could heal much more efficiently than other healers. Healers of equal skill should run out of mana at about the same time. In this situation, we didn’t want to buff everyone else to the paladin level, because we think the experience of priest, druid and shaman healers is playing out as we intended. (But we will keep monitoring things.) We understand some healers still don’t feel that they have enough mana to be able to do their jobs and we understand the design has changed somewhat from the Wrath of the Lich King healing model. However, the heroic dungeons are intended to be challenging. Moreover, the Cataclysm expansion has only been live for a week. Players are still improving their gear, learning the boss fights and getting familiar with the new healing philosophy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/143288/holy-paladin-nerfs))<br />
<br />
Holy Paladins/Holy Power<br />
Holy paladins can generate Holy Power through a number of mechanics: using Holy Shock is intended to be the main one. They can also take damage through Blessed Life or heal a Beaconed target with Flash of Light or Divine Light.<br />
<br />
The problem we were seeing is that Holy Light was made very inexpensive so that paladins always had a cheap go-to heal. Paladins had figured out to use this as a Holy Power generator for Light of Dawn. They didn’t even care about healing the tank per se – they were just casting 3 Holy Lights to earn the Light of Dawn. It seemed to us an effortless way to play that was super effective. With these changes, we expect to see paladins making more decisions – sometimes they might want to Holy Light a Beaconed target just because that’s the right spell at the moment. They may also Holy Light non-Beaconed targets. They will still Holy Shock on cooldown, which will generate plenty of Holy Power.<br />
<br />
Those of you saying Holy paladins will no longer generate Holy Power might be taking the change a little too much to heart. That's not the design intent behind Holy paladins, nor a desired outcome of the Tower of Radiance change. In fact, we haven't seen this to be the outcome since the change was applied. Often times when we bring an overpowered ability back into line, the reaction we see on the forums is that the ability itself, or the core mechanics of the spec, has been gutted. That's a natural reaction in most cases, this one being no exception, as paladins will have to adjust to a change that came rather suddenly in the middle of gameplay (i.e. in a hotfix rather than a patch).<br />
<br />
We understand there is also a mixture of concerns regarding this change which really revolve more around general healer mana regeneration in Cataclysm. Some paladins may claim Holy Light is now the only affordable heal. This is inaccurate and we're confident we'll see talented paladins shine using all of the appropriate tools in their kit. Perhaps, if anything, it means paladins can't afford to spam many different heals. That doesn't mean they're not useful given the appropriate situation.<br />
<br />
(For instance, when the tank is very injured or you have to move, use a Flash of Light. If the damage is coming in faster than you can heal, use a Divine Light. You aren’t playing badly by using these spells – you are playing badly if you only use these spells and neglect the efficient ones.)<br />
<br />
When we see players who claim they don’t have enough mana to heal, one of the following is usually true: 1) they are undergeared for the instance, 2) the tanks are trying to tank everything without CC, 3) they are avoiding Spirit on their gear, 4) they are trying to keep everyone topped off as fast as they can by resorting to fast spells (like Flash of Light) or relatively expensive area heals when they aren’t warranted. If someone is about to die – absolutely save them. Using Holy Radiance (40% mana) to get two folks who are at 95% back to 100% is not efficient. Throw a Holy Light (9% mana each) at each of them instead. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/143288/holy-paladin-nerfs))</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
In some cases 10 man can be hard, but seriously don't compare 10 man to 25 man. No way Blizzard can balance it to be equal and it's a damn shame that sites like wowprogress.com can't track progress correctly atm.<br />
<br />
The differents between 10- and 25 man are going to be more obvious when guilds starts to do heroics.<br />
<br />
BUT, hopefully sites like wowprogress are going to find a proper way to track progress soon.<br />
<br />
So yes, it does matter if the kill is done on 10 or 25 man!</div></div><hr />

Obisidum Ore now spawns slightly less frequently in Mount Hyjal.?!?!?!?! Whaaa? Obsidium is going for over 1k per stack of ore on my server because there isn't enough of it and that seemed to be the case on every server. Anyone know why it's been reduced even further?<br />
<br />
Same here. Obsidium ore already seems ridiculously hard to find at times and now they are nerfing the spawn rates? Sigh.</div></div><hr />

That's not completely true. There is many ways of extracting data from Armory. If you read wowprogress.com there is a lot of ideas how to solve the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope you are trolling, else that is quite the display of ignorance. In my experience 10 man can be a lot harder than 25 man simply because you don't have the same buffer for mistakes as you have in a 25 man raid. If one person fucks up and dies in 25 man chances are that the 24 others can go on without that person.<br />
<br />
While in 10 man if you don't overgear the fight (like if you did 10 man with actual 10 man gear and not 25 man gear) one death usually means a wipe. I can't count the times we just had to give up on LK heroic 10 man simply because one person in the raid did a single little thing wrong and we were utterly fucked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know 10 man heroic LK with only using 10 man heroic gear (not 25 man, over gearing it completely) went down after the 25 man version.<br />
<br />
The thing is in the past most top guilds have been running 10 man with 25 man gear, thus completely overgearing the encounter. This is also the experience for most people who run 25 and 10 man from WOTLK, they come into 10 man with way better gear than they should have and completely demolish it. This does not mean that 10 man is easier, it simply means it is easy if you overgear it, which is true for any encounter.<br />
<br />
I think people will realize how much harder 10 man can be now that both instances are balanced around exactly the same gear, people who are used to 25 man will get a shock when they see how little room for mistakes there are in 10 man instances.<br />
<br />
The same was true for the jump from 40 to 25 man, in 40 man you had more slack simply because you had more people. On my server (Burning Blade-EU) back in the days of MC/BWL we usually had at least 2-5 people disconnect during boss fights. In 25 man 5 people disconnecting wouldn't work, you can support 1-2 disconnects but not much more. In 10 man you really don't have much wiggle room unless it is a very easy encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
or maybe because we are only a week into the expansion and not every guild had 25 raider's ready to go. in Wrath 10 man was easier, due to the fact as people have said you can over gear it. However that isn't the case no more and I've heard allot of people say that 10 man is harder since on some fights you have the same amount of add's and damage going around, but less people to handle it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have always been against the amalgamation of 10 and 25 man raids, but the fact is, it's here. Blizzard wants to amalgamate the two, and that's what guilds are also currently doing - a lot of them switching from 1x 25 man raid to 2x10 man raids. So it only makes sense to report one world first, as, well, there is only one world first now. Also, it says 'first'. Also, there's only one achievement.<br />
<br />
I agree there are differences in difficulty etc etc, but that's not the point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying it is less trouble to arrange a 25 man raid, I am simply saying you have more leeway for fuckups in 25 man, thus it is easier to do for the average guilds (where you have some not great people in your guild). Also you obviously should get more loot in 25 man since you have more people to spread the loot between.<br />
<br />
And you said yourself you made every encounter in 25 and 10 man, and you think 10 man is a joke. This only reinforces my original assessment that you outgeared 10 man since you had 25 man gear, which of course will make it easy.<br />
<br />
And the reason we are seeing 10 man first now is most likely that the top guilds are having an easier time gathering up 10 man raids during these first few weeks when people haven't had time to level and gear properly. This does not mean 10 man is easier.</div></div><hr />

You are totally right. On the other hand, 1 noob death in a 25 man raid is not as not pernicious as in a 10 man raid :) You need 10 good players in a 10 man raid and u need 20 good players in a 25 man raid.<br />

There is no opinion here, Blizzard makes the rules. To continue to report which guilds get kills at different raid size configurations is doing a disservice to the community. It is living in the past. There is no way to independently verify these raid size kills unless they guilds themselves provide that information. The data on the Armory does not distinguish between 25/10 on achievements or stats.<br />
<br />
Whether one size is easier or not is also irrelevant to this. Although I am sure it will be debated constantly throughout this expansion, it has no bearing on who killed what first or second, etc.<br />

I found lots of obsidium in Deepholm as well, the eastern side seems to have it more than the west.<br />
<br />
Vashj'ir is also a goldmine for gathering ore/herbs if you're a druid in aquatic form and have the glyph, you swim as fast if not faster than seahorses!<br />
<br />
Same for me on Elune. I WISH that i was on those servers where Obsidium is going for 1k a stack. I still make lots of money on Obsidium, but its between 150g - 180g a stack mostly.</div></div><hr />

In some cases 10 man can be hard, but seriously don't compare 10 man to 25 man. No way Blizzard can balance it to be equal and it's a damn shame that sites like wowprogress.com can't track progress correctly atm.<br />
<br />
The differents between 10- and 25 man are going to be more obvious when guilds starts to do heroics.<br />
<br />
BUT, hopefully sites like wowprogress are going to find a proper way to track progress soon.<br />
<br />
So yes, it does matter if the kill is done on 10 or 25 man!<br />
<br />
Funnily the guilds who are leading the world first charts are 25 man guilds....hmmmmmmmmmmmmm (as now seen on wowprogress)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you feel big because u like driving the sunshine bus on a magical tour around end game instances feel free - but because you do so does not mean its a harder encounter.<br />

<br />
The whole &quot;zomg less people can die in 10m&quot; doesn't really give any more or less credit to 10m. In 25m, if you have certain people die, it can be just as disastrous. Especially when we are faced against some strict enrage timers on bosses, or various DPS races for certain phases. Losing a dps or two is a huge drop off in damage.<br />
<br />

Regardless, grats on heroic Halfus to all who did it. A simple fight on normal, but they always are. Heroic fights are where real guilds step up in the beginning, and form their own strats versus reading on the internet.</div></div><hr />

Yep it's true, 10 mans tend to be harder because one mess up = whole raid wipe...That's why so very few 10 man strict guilds killled LK on Heroic compared to how many 25 man guilds killed LK on Heroic. I don't personally think they're ever going to be able to completely balance them because 25 super geared people =/ 10 super geared people. Mechanics are mechanics and when you have more people to cover messups (particularly healers) it helps SO much. <br />
<br />
Spent all of Wrath in a 10 man strict guild. Whenever we'd do 25 mans before becoming a 10 man strict guild, it was stupid. I could eff it up bad, die and we'd still down the boss, np...<br />
<br />
The only thing harder about 25s is all on the raid leader in that he has to get 25 people online, ready and most of them cooperating. They likely did 10 first because they could not always get 25 people on and staying for that long, so if you mean like that, that 25 is harder, then yes.<br />
<br />
I think we can all agree that Heroic is what matters.</div></div><hr />

That was the real reason Ensidia got shoehorned out if you want to split hairs. I should know, I used to work for Vivendi in the days before Activision. It isnt about competing with Paragon, you simply CANT compete with forces arrayed like that against you if they want their cheesecake first. They will go over combat logs for hours and find any means that they can use to achieve their goals. Even if its something that is a technicality and legitimate error. Look at the WoW Forums and the replies to Feedback in Wrath / Cataclysm Beta if you need further proof of that. But hey your entitled to your opinion chief. I just know I pay $9.99 for WoW because I have a discount.<br />
<br />
<br />
In any case, lets try to keep the talk clean. Your trolling, and baiting people in a hope for incendiary replies, and thats against the ToU on MMO's forums. Both guilds Adept and Ensidia are equally skilled and succeeded where 90% of the player base cannot. Saying that 25 &gt; 10 man is like saying Apples beat Oranges. They both drop the same loot, and they both are balanced. You can do either 1 or the other but not both, or I wager Ensidia or Adept would of had the 25 man Achieve also.<br />
<br />
And yes Vazar, I concur. Priest Buffs are grooood. ^_^</div></div><hr />

oh yea also 25 man much harder than 10 man, especially for world firsts, in 10 man an individual loss may be more important but for 25 man you also have 15 people that need to be geared and not stupid to fuck everything up. On LK for example thats 15 more people that may stupidly stand in defile and wipe the raid. with world firsts that means you need to have 15 more pathetic nerds racing through content to be all geared up and ready to go to be finished all the content and then do nothing for the next 3+ months for a patch then race through it all again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 10 and 25 man raids sharing the same loot is a signal from Blizzard that they don't feel 25-man raiding is necessary or even desired now.<br />
<br />
There are two reasons why 25-man raiding won't go away:<br />
1. existing large guilds who have a long-standing 25-man raid core can keep doing their thing without guild drama or split<br />
2. new guilds who want to grow bigger for guild achievements and to level up the guild more quickly can have one 25-man raid instead of coordinating two or three 10-man raids.<br />
<br />
The 25-man raiders can drop the snobbery and elitism. Blizzard is trying very hard to make 10-man and 25-man raids equivalent in effort and reward.</div></div><hr />

Apparently, you missed everything Blizzard said about Cataclysm raids. 10-man and 25-man raids are specifically designed to be equal in difficulty. Furthermore, because one person slacking in a 10-man raid has a greater impact than one person slacking in a 25-man raid, 10-mans are arguably more demanding of player skill.</div></div><hr />

10-man is more difficult than 25-man for the same reason 25-man was more difficult than 40-man. A player who's slacking off in the raid gets less of a free ride from the large group of people. Hunters used to AFK in vanilla 40-man raids without people noticing.<br />

agreed they just like to believe that 10 man makes them even better because they don't need to coordinate that many people and they get to be in a smaller crowd of super nerds who try too hard at a game that ultimately leads to nothing. They like to believe things like this matters so they want to be in an even more exclusive loser group.</div></div><hr />

10's aren't as hard as 25's and they never will be. They don't need gear as good as 25's and the first time I see someone count a 10m as a true world first, I'll be really disappointed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize that 10m and 25m gear is now identical, right? There is no better gear for 25m and it is no longer possible to outgear a 10m raid with 25m gear.<br />
<br />
The only reason why 25m is more difficult is because you have 15 more people who are potential idiots in the raid.</div></div><hr />

There is no opinion here, Blizzard makes the rules. To continue to report which guilds get kills at different raid size configurations is doing a disservice to the community. It is living in the past. There is no way to independently verify these raid size kills unless they guilds themselves provide that information. The data on the Armory does not distinguish between 25/10 on achievements or stats.<br />
<br />
Whether one size is easier or not is also irrelevant to this. Although I am sure it will be debated constantly throughout this expansion, it has no bearing on who killed what first or second, etc.<br />
<br />
Its time to move forward with the new vision Blizzard has given us and stop looking back at the past.<br />
<br />
No Boub makes the rules of this site, hence can report whatever he wants. Personally i want to hear about both.</div></div><hr />
