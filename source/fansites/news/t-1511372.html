Orcs will come through the Dark Portal and take over Blackrock Mountain in the Warlords of Draenor world event.<br />
The alliance will work with Velen, Akama, and Maraad in Shadowmoon Valley. <br />
Assaults on your garrison will happen repeatedly, and get harder as time goes on. You will keep upgrading the item level of your followers. <br />
You will have to make many choices about the buildings in your garrison as you level through the zones.<br />
After boosting to 90, all of the things in your bags will be mailed to you. The mail has an unlimited duration, so you can sort through those things whenever you want.<br />
Flexible size raids will allow you to have anywhere from 10 to 30 players in a raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Can you please consider the over-simplifying you all are doing to the game. You will lose even more subscribers if you proceed.<br />
A) Threatening sub loss got old a looong time ago. B) Read our reasoning in the patch notes; we're removing complexity, not depth. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455533918519717888))<br />
I would have to disagree. DoT Snapshotting was one of the only things that gave DPS depth, or skill for that matter.<br />
We agree, in theory, but not in practice. In practice, an addon did it. That wasn't removed as part of ability pruning anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455542269265715200))<br />
Weren't we told over and over again that snapshotting was going away? Was this idea reverted?<br />
No...? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455547441698205696))<br />
<br />
Is the Gladiator's Resolve talent an experiment that might get expanded to other tank classes eventually? #BloodDPS<br />
Possibly. Not for Warlords, but it is an experiment that we're eager to see the results of, so to speak. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455666640177229825))<br />

My concern is that very few top level death knights take RE. I'll admit I don't have data to back this up however.<br />
It's more than you may think, but still not high. Overall, yes, this row is OK. All get some play, with RE being the least. And... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455548036429537280))<br />
...we think that will be improved a bit by having some spare GCDs in your rotation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455548145024253952))<br />

WoD: Without Vengeance and changes to Arcane - Arcane AoE sounds like suicide. Comments?<br />
Tanks will generate about as much threat as they do today under most circumstances; AoEing tanked mobs shouldn't be an issue. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455541291514732544))<br />
And fights like Dark Shamans? This AoE change just screams death to me. :c<br />
Which AoE change in particular do you mean, just so we're clear? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455550104666001408))<br />
<br />
Have we seen everything in terms of new abilities/passives/perks (non-talent stuff) for mages?<br />
Well Alpha isn't Release; things may still change. But no more new abilities currently planned. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455547612347637760))<br />
I see. Considered giving PoM to Fire so Combustion is more controllable burst like Arcane Power/IV? Or intentional difference?<br />
Intentional difference. Don't want to have SO much of your damage concentrated into that one 10sec period. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455557219946209280))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
Avengers Shield used to silence all targets struck. Seems it only does the initial target now. Will it go back in WoD?<br />
No plans to, no. It's more power than is needed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455290738071187456))<br />
<br />
You mentioned that H-Paladins would keep the 10% haste from SoI. Why opt for haste instead of just lowering cast times baseline?<br />
Haste is more easily understood. We don't normally do faster cast times for specific specs often. Also, haste reduces the GCD too (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455565711444701185))<br />
Is haste reducing gcd for all class/specs? If so are paladins getting something in place of this perk?<br />
Haste has always reduced the GCD for spells, for everyone. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/455595332902989825))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Are we ever going to see 10man only raids like Karazhan and Zul'Aman again?<br />
No current plans for fixed-side 10-player raids -- what is the appeal to you of a raid that allows 10, but not 11, 12, etc? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455145854920192000))<br />
<br />
but it would be a lot more useful in LFR? why have it for dungeons and not lfr?<br />
Heroic dungeons in particular will be more challenging than LFR, and one unprepared player can have a greater negative impact. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455718079226318848))<br />
<br />
My nhc raid is just plain stuck at 14/14. We are old folks with jobs/kids etc. We will not improve our game much more.<br />
If you can kill Garrosh, you absolutely should be able to do at least the first 8 on the next difficulty up. Have you tried? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455817490350620672))<br />
<br />
Please give us bosses tuned around Garrosh NHC that we can progress on. Immerseus HC is too easy, anything beyond too hard.<br />
Are you a 25-player or 10-player group? Fallen Protectors and Norushen should be well within reach if you've killed Garrosh. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455820251888775169))<br />
thx for your reply. we are 25man. we spent some time on norushen, but even with quite aggressive healer/dps ratios...&gt;<br />
Fallen Protectors is probably a better next step on 25H; try making He and Sun transition simultaneously if you haven't been. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455840513753497600))<br />
Thx again, we will try that. I read from your response that there are no zone buffs/debuffs planned for T16. Thx Digerati, too.<br />
Correct, there's no zonewide aura planned. We're keeping an eye on overall progression rates in case targeted nerfs are needed (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455848579551096833))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Disagree, I actually enjoy playing 2v2. Not as much as I did back in TBC, but I still have fun with it...<br />
2v2 is more accessible. Less people to track. Feel like Dampening was important change for that bracket. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455351605920292864))<br />
I haven't played much post-dampening change tbh. But I'm curious, will dampening change in WoD?<br />
We're pretty happy with Dampening. Starting at 5 minutes in 3s is still on the table. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455356589084770304))<br />
<br />
Will Rated battlegrounds get spectator mode as well?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455539604838690816))<br />
Awesome stuff. Although will people use to to cheat to check on rogue ambushes at nodes?<br />
Spectator mode is geared towards people that want to broadcast tournaments. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455563306728947712))<br />
<br />
Ever considered doing a BG where the goal is within a certain time limit, most kills win?<br />
you never know (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/455727240396152832))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
I'm a little worried about Engineering in WoD after interview. I'd love more info on this!<br />
What in particular worries you about it? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455762773448744962))<br />
it sounds like they're turning into enchants anyone can use, and are interchangeable with potions? I like that its unique to eng<br />
Engineering will keep some personal toys and fun stuff. The main thing that's changing is just Nitro Boost. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455764915760791552))<br />
so in effect, everyone gets a speed boost every 3 mins? not saying it's a bad thing, but will have an impact on button bloat.<br />
The thought is to actually have that particular effect be on the potion cooldown. Intravenous Swiftness Potion, basically. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455801959446892544))<br />
<br />
You think sharing with Synapse Springs would be more fitting? Both 'lore'-wise and to be dps forgiving. 3 mins is a long time<br />
Synapse Springs are gone, as part of the general disarmament of passive/rotational DPS perks from professions. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455815017825202177))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Will MoP farming be coming in WoD somehow? I enjoy farming and don't want to see it die in Wod.<br />
Your Draenor garrison has a farm plot, though your friends from Sunsong Ranch will remain there. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/455131203109003264))<br />

Those blue posts just prove it. Answers are not satisfying and not really answering the question completely. They should listen community instead of dictating their own plans. They will really lose subs if they oversimplificate the gameplay by removing abilities. It's not threatening, it's reality. I hope they re-consider what they've planned to do. As a hunter player i wasn't happy with the removal of readiness and i am not happy with the current changes in Alpha. Especially, with the rapid fire, i still don't understand why they remove it and why that is necessary.</div></div><hr />

I am sure that the garrison won't be a Tomagatchi that you have to worry about so often. It will probably only be attacked while you are logged on.<br />
<br />
Of course I could easily be wrong there.</div></div><hr />

Its a helluva leap to get from garrisons will be attacked to having to rebuild the whole thing if you skip a few days. Someone needs to up their anxiety meds</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not the way it works at all. You get an announcement that troops are forming to attack your garrison. Then, whenever you go back to the Garrision, you actually trigger the attack when you are ready. The actual mechanism will be a solo scenario where your followers will be in the garrison to help you defend against the invasion. The more you level your followers and the better gear they have, the more they can help you during the scenario.<br />
<br />
Or in other words, think of it this way. It is a solo scenerio that you can only queue for every few days when the game tells you it is available for you.<br />
<br />
There is no negative things that happens, but you do get rewards when you finish the scenario.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They make sure you don't run out of hotkeys. They can't ever just keep adding new skills without retiring old ones. Seriously, how is that oversimplification? Did you even try to consider any rational viewpoint except &quot;oh, there is change, let's whine&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What will happen (was been talked about and datamined,) is this:<br />
Hypothetically, let's say that recently you did a lot of damage to<br />
a group of ogres; at some point after that while you are logged in, <br />
you'll get an alert kind of thing that will pop up and say &quot;Highmaul <br />
Ogres are preparing to attack your Garrison!&quot; or something. <br />
<br />
Then you can go to your Garrison, call in some friends, keep questing, <br />
whatever. Whenever you eventually do return to your Garrison, <br />
you'll have a bit of time and then the Highmaul will start attacking, <br />
and you and your people can defend it, using the perks and such <br />
from buildings you have as well as your own merit. <br />
<br />
At the very least, that's how I read it. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2014-05-04, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I would love to see less garrisons more actual game .

<br />
Not sure if they said it in this interview, but in a different one they said that things will work more on a weekly basis. They also said that if all you want to do is raid or do arenas, then garrisons will not be required in any way. Any gear you can get from garrisons will take weeks or months to get, so will always be behind people who are raiding from the beginning. It will take months in order to level up followers to the point where they can do the raid-missions that reward raid gear to the player.. so unless you really suck at raiding, it isn´t going to be required.<br />
<br />
But heck, why am I typing this.. it was the same type of idiots who cried about the 5.0 dailies as being mandatory even though you were capped at 1000Vp per week. People are just too stupid to see how it all fits together on a schedule. Instead they will see ´you can get raid gear from garrisions and just stary crying and whining on the forums about them being mandatory'..</div></div><hr />

They can't ever just keep adding new skills without retiring old ones. Seriously, how is that oversimplification? Did you even try to consider any rational viewpoint except &quot;oh, there is change, let's whine&quot;?<br />
<br />
I do realize that we run out of hotkeys. I can see that from my warlock's bar tho. And why do you even take it as whining? I am criticizing the current changes, i also get that there are too many skills but I think removing major skills is just not right. I don't really care about scatter shot or distracting shot being removed, but removing skills like readiness and rapid fire is something beyond editing hotkeys. It's that simple. Those skills might be old skills that people have been using for years but those were the major cooldowns for a hunter. It's not only about one class tho, each class is in the same situation. I don't want to see WoW to transform into one those mmorpg which is played by 5-6 keys. So i am sharing my concern.</div></div><hr />

no tier gear no sale simple for me, but what do you think lfr players like myself would do if we don't have to run lfr for the gear every week if we gear up instantly. let me tell you what i would do log off i have no interest in doing flex or organized raids. i have tier on 8 toons its the only reason i sub at max level after getting lormaster and 8 farms done.<br />

Just because you feel that way, doesn't mean most people feel that way. Yeah it sucks that we've ended up stuck with SoO for longer than we wanted, but you're really going to say Blizzard have released no 'real' information about it? I guess all the interviews they've done, all the questions they answer on twitter, and all the regular blog posts they do don't count? Seriously, they've released a tonne of information, how many games get developed where you have this much insight into the process and this much contact with the developers while its happening?

I see that as Blizzard trying to incentive people to progress beyond LFR.<br />
<br />
You know, you can log in and do a Flex run in a couple hours. There are very, very few people that are actually serious about scheduling Flex runs. <br />

If you don't have the time to do even that, I'm not even sure why you'd be playing, you know, a gear-based MMORPG.</div></div><hr />

Over all, I'm highly anticipating the trimmed down spell books, seeing DPS classes playing much more efficiently, seeing each spell you cast have a greater impact.<br />
Yes, seeing professions take a hit is a bit disheartening, but so is getting rejected from joining a raid guild for having the &quot;wrong&quot; professions which is, in my opinion, even worse. Still going to be keeping up with mine to learn the best ways to earn gold from others who don't bother with professions. :D</div></div><hr />

Good, this new breed of LFR heroes needs to leave before you kill the game. You don't need gear. The only reason real raiders need gear is because it is essential to overcome new bosses and future tiers of content. Gear becomes obsolete so fast that it doesn't even matter. I'd rather they remove gear all together and make it 100% skill based.<br />

<br />
It's sad to see. Everyone is here because they are passionate about WoW. It is the one common interest we all have. And to see people being dismissed so openly and readily says volumes about how this community has changed.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm not liking the changes in and direction of WoD. The class changes rub me the wrong way, I have no interest in garrisons, and I'm not a huge fan of how Blizzard is interacting with their fan base. These are all purely my opinions. I've pre-ordered, so I'm definitely going to give it a try, but I'm not optimistic that WoD is going to be to my liking. And that's 100% fine. I've enjoyed this game for almost 10 years now, and if it's moving in a different direction that what I like, more power to the people that enjoy that direction. But that doesn't make me a &quot;whiner&quot; or a &quot;crybaby&quot; or whatever other insult is being tossed around. It just makes me a person with an opinion. Just like everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.

Gear doesn't make you a good player. Gear means absolutely nothing. Gear is gating of power and nothing more. If you want tier sets for cosmetic purposes you can wait until the next tier and go back and do it easy mode with a few friends. If you don't want to look like &quot;uncommon world drops&quot;, use the transmogrification feature that was implemented for this very purpose.</div></div><hr />

That isn´t the way it is going to work. Forget everything you are thinking, and imagine this. Every 4th day you get the option to queue for a solo scenerio. that scenario consists of you, along with your followers, and any online friends who want to come along, doing a scenerio where you are defending your garrison. That is it. you will joing the scenario, be in the middle of your garrison, and suddenly bad guys will start pouring in. The more you upgrade and level your followers, the easier it will be. <br />
<br />
That is all it is going to be. They are NOT going to invade your garrison until you decide to queue for the scenaro. If you never queue for the scenario nothing bad will happen to your garrison except you will not get the reward for completing it. It really is just a very cool scenario where your followers actually help you.</div></div><hr />

Dailies in 5.0 felt mandatory, not for the VP, but rather for the rep.

I'm a bit sketchy about Garrisons being mandatory, but i know that Blizzard has stated several times how announcements right off the bat are never final, and i don't think it's a big deal really. They are mandatory for leveling experience, but nothing stops me from not avoiding it at level cap, which is where most players spend their time. Plus, Garrisons seem to benefit you alot more than people give them credit for. They give you good leveling gear, gold, help you with your professions as well as limited access into other proffs. Idk why you WOULDNT want to use a Garrison for leveling or at cap. My point is that people need to keep an open mind instead of reading one Alpha patch note and giving their traditional &quot;Cater To Me or I Quit&quot; speech. I honestly wish so many people weren't like that in the WoW community so blizz would stop seeing the whiny majority over the sensible minority. But oh well, what can you do?<br />

<br />
Yes, but the 1000VP cap meant that it would be weeks until you could buy anything and the rate at which you gained VP was so slow that it was a waste of time to have 6 different reps fully opened up by the second or third week. There never was any realistic reason to do dailies every day, and certainly not more than 1 or 2 reps at a time.<br />
<br />
it is exactly the same way people are looking at WoD and saying ´omg, I have to run 4 levels of raids´ without seeing the big picture of how it is all scheduled. If you are pushing into heroic or mythic raids by the 4th week, that is when the first 4 bosses of LFR is finally going to be opening up.<br />

I honestly wish so many people weren't like that in the WoW community so blizz would stop seeing the whiny majority over the sensible minority. But oh well, what can you do?<br />
<br />
Rant Mode: Off<br />
<br />
If you want to level by doing dungeons or PVP, you can completely ignore Garrisons. It will end up being something that you have to visit a few times once you hit lvl 100.<br />
<br />
If you want to level by doing quests, but want to ignore Garrisons. It will be like a quest hub that you will frequently be sent to during the course of leveling from 90 to 100. Think of it as that little fort in Kun Lai summit that you free which becomes a quest hub. Many of your quest rewards will be stuff that benefits your garrison, but you can simply choose and ignore your choice ( ie, pick a blacksmith follower over a adventuring follower). They will end up in your Garrison, but you don´t need to do anything with them.<br />
<br />
But personally, I think people are bitching for the sake of bitching. There is a very small subset of the playerbase that ONLY wants to do one specific activity, so anything besides ´hardcore´ raiding is something that is forced on them, or ´mandatory´.. The devs should just completely ignore these players and let them drift away because not only are they negative, but their fixation on one activity makes them always the vocal minority with ´not enough to do´. One of the reasons you hear so much bitching about SoO lasting 9 months is because those are the players who do not want to do anything else in the game but raid. Pet battles, pvp, crafting... they ignore all those things as ´unimportant´ and then complain because they are bored with raiding SoO.</div></div><hr />

Alot =/= all. Mages will still have poly, Rogues will still have Sap, etc. They trimmed down CCs for PvP, not PvE.<br />
<br />
I agree with one of the points that some of the 5.X patches we're, not rushed, but they could have prolonged it a little so that SoO wouldn't seem so long. I remember just a week (maybe 2?) after 5.0 dropped that there were already blue posts about 5.1. They could've extended 5.0 and 5.2 for a month each and I don't think anyone would've mind, since some people were still working on those raids.</div></div><hr />

-Flexible size raids will allow you to have anywhere from 10 to 30 players in a raid, provided client and server performance is okay.<br />
-Having to redo the grinding parts of the legendary quest chain again on alts also wasn't great, so in the future this would be something that you can skip on alts.<br />
-The team wants to let players scale down to an appropriate level to do older dungeons. They hope to do it at some point in the not too distant future. Initially this would just be for dungeons, not raids.<br />
-PROVING GROUNDS<br />
-Heroic dungeons in particular will be more challenging than LFR (but why then give weaker rewards i'm curious)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they will be available from day 1, and they will be spammable, you can queue for each one every day, and you can still do them on random basically as many times as you want per day. LFR on the other hand, won´t be available until the 4th week of the expansion, and even then it will only be the first 4 bosses, and they have a weekly lockout.<br />

You don´t have to ´build´ it. If you want to ignore the gameplay of Garrisons, probably it will end up just like a quest hub you have to visit a few times from 90 to 100.</div></div><hr />

Those were some of the pretty crappy changes brought on from Cata and MoP. I felt pretty down and out about WoW during this expansion, really didn't raid much or care. This expansion, to me, was much more boring than Cata---and Cata was pretty bad! The WoD news and info is what is bringing me back. I honestly think a lot of people will come back. It seems like they are trying to cater to everyone but in a good way this time. I'm having a difficult time understanding most of the complaints against the new expansion, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still feel like removing instants and movement is a mistake. It is some of the more enjoyable aspects of any class, for example lightning bolts while moving just has such a nice- FEEL-. I don't care about damage compensations, they can't compensate for the loss of feel. Additionally, yes you have to design around movement if present, but really is that a bad thing? I'm sure it's easier without but it also leads to potentially dumber boss design, since there has to be no (or less) account for players avoiding things intelligently. Furthermore I never felt like these 2 were the problems in pvp either, it was rather the amount of silence effect and particularly in conjuction with the amount of other CC that effectively silences through lack of control. Again, lightning bolt while moving was to me what actually enabled elemental in pvp as a normally functioning class and not a weird gimmick with occasional burst.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt its a mater of the games age.I think it's more of the fact that the community is getting worse and worse along with Blizzard's slacking on the recent expansions (talking about Cata and Mists).So far WoD looks promising,but i don't see the same thing in peoples behave either on forums or in-game.<br />
Recently i joined a LFR just for the lols and you probably have no idea how the &quot;pro's&quot; treat others.If someone don't raise to the level of their &quot;e-peen&quot; its called a &quot;scrub&quot;.But i don't need to tell you that,u can see for yourself how some of the community gets treated on the forums.<br />
<br />
No mater the games age,if that said game is fun with a good community i'm sure the subs won't drop like it did lately.Sadly the game lacks both.</div></div><hr />

These people are in denial. Threatening sub losses? The loss of 6 million subscriptions happened, therefore it is reality, not a threat. By the time this expansion is over, all they'll have left is their hardcore fanboys, so expect this &quot;threat&quot; to become reality... again.</div></div><hr />

All i see is blizzard screaming 'GARRISONS' in my face, which makes me feel dissapointed because to me all it looks like is a lackluster timewasting gimmick thrown in to waste the other 80% of your time out of raiding....a bit like pet battles.<br />
Im still holding off buying this expansion because of this.</div></div><hr />

It was a beta test, you still had to have people test all the old content in the game, in case something was broken. It happened before when they released a patch on the test server for WoTLK, and there was an elk in the middle of the Exodar. Two completely unrelated areas, yet they broke something.<br />
<br />
And sorry, the whole &quot;we're giving all the hardcore raiders everything and ignoring everyone else&quot; attitude of this expansion will kill the game. You don't cater to the minority, you cater to the majority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly think they should just stop saying things like this, even if it's honestly true, it's almost impossible for any one to believe.<br />
<br />
I'd love to be surprised and it to be true, but you know, can't keep believing the wolf.<br />
<br />
Didnt they fire alot of the staff due to cutbacks a while ago? Something i slightly remember, from a year ago or something...<br />
<br />
Anyway they promised things would go better from MoP forward and promised faster patches and expansion, yet here we are again. By the time WoD hits the shelves we have run rampant trough SoO for over a year. The Alliance might aswell have moved into Orgrimmar and live there by then.<br />

If you can't understand why balance is completely out of wack because of too much mobile casting, then honestly I think you should quit forever. The game obviously isn't for you.<br />
<br />
Doesnt change the fact that going back on mobile casting is a retarded and outdated move and they should find the solution elsewhere. Makes no sense at all not being able to cast spells and move at the same time. Hurr Durr im a turret. Come on, its 2014 for christ sake. Maybe balance it out by reducing casters damage and increase melee damage slightly or some other penalty? Surely theres a better solution then being forced to stand still do your rotation like a robot.</div></div><hr />

If casters and healers are going to be as mobile as they have been in Mop then you're going to need mass cc to keep them in check which I think everyone agreed wasn't very fun. Boomkin and shadow priests are a good example of where casters should be. They have some things to cast while moving, but it's not their full rotation.</div></div><hr />

I've played mobile ranged DDs (lock, hunter) as well as melees (monk, DK) before I quit some months ago and both types are fun. What I can't stand is the immobilty of a shadow priest for example (if he doesn't have a lot of targets for multi dotting nearby). If this is their vision how WoW as a caster is meant to be, than I agree: WoW isn't for me any more.<br />
There are plenty of knobs to turn im my opinion regarding the balance between ranged and melee damage... but forcing casters into turret mode again like it's still 1998 is not the one they should be thinking about.</div></div><hr />

Then it is a good thing YOU don't get to decide what is or is not outdated or modern.</div></div><hr />

imo it has all been turned towards a WAY TO MUCH mobility ( at least for ranged dps). I enjoy standing still and doing my stuff, (mage in vanilla, tbc, wotlk - soon to be mage again). back in the [I]good old days[I] mages didnt have instant pyro, finger of frost etc, and it was alot of fun. some ranged had some mobility but not as crazy as it is now and have been for a while. ranged had alot of dps, but sacrifised the mobility. melee that alot of mobility, at the cost of some dps - and in the end it didnt matter that much if you were melee or ranged, because some fight had alot of movement, while others didnt. sometimes i feel that the game has been centered to much about balance, insted of making the playstyle different for classes.</div></div><hr />

I don't know whether you've been keeping up on current events but they're taking us back to pre-TBC's bad old days. They're getting rid of flying, why not get rid of mobility too. Hell, bring back ammo for hunters and make us use mana again... you know they want to.</div></div><hr />

Fixed. That's the reality of this so called expansion. No &quot;new&quot; land. Simply the same area in another time. BFD. No new classes, no new races, and it's more of the caverns of time nonsense *again*. I love wow but to defend this piss poor expansion is laughable. It's going to be cata all over again.</div></div><hr />
