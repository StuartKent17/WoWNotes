Patch 5.3 - Dungeon Journal UI<br />
Patch 5.3 finally makes it faster to move through the Dungeon Journal by putting boss selections for an instance on the left always, and loot, abilities, and model on the right, making it much faster to switch between bosses to find the right loot list. <br />
<br />

<br />
Otis - Dungeon Journal Addon<br />
If you don't want to wait a few weeks for Patch 5.3, you can install the Otis addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/otis) to make life a little bit easier. It adds arrows to the side of the Dungeon Journal that allows you to quickly move up and down through the boss list. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character<br />
I'd say Glyphs and Talents look too similar atm.<br />
Yeah, I think that's fair criticism. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329390939359555584))<br />
<br />
We added talents in vanilla so rogue 1 and rogue 2 could be different. With tri spec, what if every rogue feels the same again? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329314508231290881))<br />
I think you picked the worst class to make an example for you here.<br />
In my experience, hunters are even more likely to swap specs than rogues. Even rogue specs have more kit than hunter specs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329396445436317696))<br />
<br />
Pandora's box was open at the moment you allowed us to change spec unlimited number of times.<br />
Then maybe we need to close the box. Another idiom is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330064371646615554))<br />
<br />
Can you reconcile your tweet yesterday about yr friend being &quot;just a druid&quot; w/ the &quot;Bring the player not the class&quot; mentality?<br />
I don't think it's a contradiction. You should be able to bring a Balance or Feral most of the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330063854128230400))<br />
Now there are some cases where we discourage extreme ranged or melee stacking, which is more necessary evil than cool design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330064055622565888))<br />
<br />
And how about &quot;bring player - not spec&quot; argument?<br />
Unless you are on heroic Lei Shen, you can probably play any spec you want and be fine. This was not the case in Sunwell. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330063019784695810))<br />
In Sunwell, you had to stack certain classes to get the right buff / debuff matrix. That is what &quot;bring the player&quot; was all about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330063157752131584))<br />
<br />
How much would you like Crit, Haste and Mastery to be just as good as one another for all specs, allowing freedom for style?<br />
It's tricky. If they are all interchangeable, then you don't look at the stats at all. Better would be if you can feel the delta. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330062615797719040))<br />
For some casters, you can really feel diff between a high crit and high haste build. I wish it felt more so for everyone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330062725193543682))<br />
Then the stats could be equal value while the decision was still meaningful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330062781573369856))<br />
<br />
I was looking at simulation numbers on noxxic. Can't believe I'm alone in thinking it's demotivating to see my class so low.<br />
We don't put much faith in class comparisons from sims. Different people with different skills work on the various components. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443052009275392))<br />
So even if e.g. the hunter simming is strong, it may not mesh with the shaman simming. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443160398475264))<br />
Sims are better for helping you determine gems, rotations, reforge etc. for your character. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443257228189696))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Can we get a heads up as to VP incoming patch, will it be reset or can I have it stored ready?<br />
We will give you notification before 5.3 ships. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330445237279420417))<br />
<br />
Sunwell raids stacked the top DPS with 1 each of the buff classes. Heroic ToT is the same except it's Raid CDs now.<br />
Disagree. Heroic ToT class stacking is nothing like Sunwell class stacking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330406718657925122))<br />
<br />
This is opposite of truth. Having the highest ilvl possible when stepping into ANY raid IS MANDATORY<br />
I disagree. Skill has a much greater impact than ilevel. That is why Blood Legion can beat content with very little new gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329762859645030400))<br />
Worldclass is irrelevant. There'd be no point to gear if it didn't facilitate success. Stop with the straw man.<br />
But skill matters more than gear especially for non-worldclass, because the worldclass can't improve their skill much more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330055757594767362))<br />
Gear helps for sure. If you want to farm LFR for tiny DPS upgrades, go for it. My contention is that behavior is optional. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330055570600128513))<br />
mechanics or not the guild rollling in a sub 496 ilvl is gonna have a bad time in tot where the 515 guys are gonna breeze<br />
Yes, that is different. If you don't have a lot of N gear from previous tier, then LFR will serve as a useful catchup. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330079596965941248))<br />
<br />
why is it we can burn extra mogu coins in LFR but not on nalak for example?<br />
We didn't want to encourage rampant realm hopping, which can lead to instability when there are too many folks in one spot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330059425085804546))<br />
Now that 5.2 has been out for awhile, it would probably be okay for the older bosses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330059498163159040))<br />
<br />
have you consider make DBM as default UI, like many other popular 3rd party UIs they are becoming essentials<br />
We try to communicate essential info in raids. The raid mods often provide too much info, which has 2 problems. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329755056725434368))<br />
Difficulty is probably obvious, but they also make fights seem complicated by bringing your attention to stuff you could ignore. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329755569437155328))<br />
<br />
I have even seen in blue posts where you or someone else says normal raiders run LFR! Pls get stories straight!!!<br />
Some heroic raiders run LFR. The question is how forced they feel to do so. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329760895804784640))<br />
In 5.0 when everyone was in blues, LFR gave epics and felt really important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761121957457920))<br />
In 5.2, LFR offers much less to N raiders unless you've been unlucky or are impatient to complete a set or something. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761270549069824))<br />
As I've said, if it's fun for you, go for it. I wouldn't consider it mandatory though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761437834702849))<br />
In heroic, there are tight enrage timers. In 5.2, there really aren't in normal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761527118831617))<br />
It comes down to your error rate on mechanics. Improving ilevel can gives you more room to have more errors and still win. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329761797718540288))<br />
But causing fewer errors in the first place is likely an even surer track to victory. (gives -&gt; give) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329762024735244292))<br />
<br />
don't you fear pve gear will become too strong and scare away pure pvpers who dont want to pve?<br />
We don't think PvE gear will be more attractive than PvP gear for PvP with these changes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329753894668365825))<br />
<br />
the blog about how to gear was a little inelegant and convoluted let's say. Is End game gearing gonna be like that forever?<br />
What we don't like is that the current system is fairly opaque. Nothing tells you &quot;Go here for a good belt upgrade.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330442690971975682))<br />
Also, the system gets more convoluted when tiers advance. Should I do MV LFR or ToT LFR? Is the DMF trinket still good? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330442840310165504))<br />
We like to encourage lots of different paths towards a goal rather than e.g. raid or die. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330442584164032512))<br />
what if i just want to raid or die? All I want to do is dungeon and rad? Why can't that be an optimal choice? Not the only one<br />
Optimal tends to become the only. We try to make the most optimal path the most diverse one (but again not the only one). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330445478024081408))<br />

Ghostcrawler replied to some more tri spec tweets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3233-Patch-5-3-The-Old-Seer-Ghostcrawler-on-Tri-Spec-Blue-Tweets-Fifth-Element-Video).<br />
<br />
May 2<br />
<br />
Patch 5.3 PTR - Build 16911 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3234-Patch-5-3-PTR-Build-16911) was released, and halved the amount of PvP Power (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/gems?filter-pvpp-val=0&amp;filter-pvpp-op=1) and PvP Resilience (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/gems?filter-pvpr-val=0&amp;filter-pvpr-op=1) on gems.<br />
There was a blog post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3235-Catching-Up-to-5-3-Battleground-With-the-Blues-Blue-Posts) about how to catch up on gearing in Patch 5.2 and 5.3.<br />
<br />
May 3<br />
<br />
We looked at (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tVxeGagXpM&amp;feature=player_embedded) the new Brawler's Guild mount, the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98405.jpg Brawler's Burly Mushan Beast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/98405-brawlers-burly-mushan-beast).<br />
Some new Hearthstone cards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3236-Brawler-s-Guild-Mount-Heroic-Scenarios-Blue-Tweets-Warlock-HS-Card-OpenRaid-Event) were revealed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/may/ssdgraph.gif) seem to be moving back up slowly, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. No new GPUs or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before the third quarter this year. RAM prices have been increasing for the past few months, so if you were thinking about adding RAM anytime soon, now is the time.<br />
<br />
The new Haswell CPUs from Intel are almost here and should bring a mild performance improvement, power usage reduction, and significantly better integrated graphics. <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />
<br />

Some of us like quiet kerboards too. And It's not like WoW is so twitchy that you need a mechanical keyboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no. BGs and arenas will downscale gear to top pvp ilevel. And world pvp is a joke anyway, its basically 99% of time pvp geared dicks ganking questing pvers, atleast now pvers will have a fighting chance.</div></div><hr />

Alternatively, they need to just look at getting rid of some of the ability bloat so that casual players read them more. I'd also suggest the ability to pull up a boss DJ by having it targeted and using the right click menu. The DJ's a great feature but I don't feel like it has been fully embraced enough by the audience that doesn't watch videos but prefers to learn about a fight in-game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah you use amazon but the prices for UK are alot more than US<br />
<br />
example: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Intel-Generation-i5-3570K-3-40GHz-Technology/dp/B007RUZKK6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367798140&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Intel+i5-3570K which is a CPU in one of the builds. in uk its £171.97 in dollars its $267.63 so if your from US you save about $60 in the UK it costs an extra $60 how about adding US and EU prices cos it says you do it every one to two months on these comp things so its ample time to add EU links for special offers, same goes for black friday stuff that was on here just US based stuff.<br />

why is it every front page has been nerfs to PVP stuff buffs to PVE and stuff like the dungeon UI to make there lifes easier, why not go the full monty blizzard and let every PVE player have there own personal GM and people say PVE is hard. heres how to PVE<br />
<br />
1. read up tactics on icyveins etc<br />
2. do the boss on PTR where it dnt even matter<br />
3. look at the bosses moves in the journal so you dnt wipe<br />
4.get a group and faceroll for free loots<br />
<br />
PVP always gets the middle finger in wow and please dnt say its a side game, as much ppl pve as they do PVP.<br />
<br />
the front page off mmo champion wouldnt be complete without nerfs to pvp and buffs to pve and useless tweets from the pvp killer ghostcrawler (plz retire and do us all a favour)</div></div><hr />

top 25man in the world: &quot;bring more warlocks. need melee? bring a rogue.&quot; &quot;oh yeah and lotsa raid CDs LOL&quot;<br />
<br />
GC: &quot;I disagree.&quot;<br />
<br />
its like you read ToT reviews from top guilds and they're basically the opposite of what GC thinks. does the dude ever do anything outside of 1800 rated BGs on his mage? <br />
<br />
fire his ass and get someone with a clue.<br />

Alright then chump, then link me your multi-glad achie, with the exception of season 4 and 12 because those were broken to shit. Seriously, it's always the 1600s scrubs that shittalk on pve. Well, if PvE is so scripted and easy, why don't most of the high ranked locks NOT have the green fire quest done? <br />
<br />
Moreover, you make me laugh if you truly believe PvP is NOT scripted in a way like PvE is, especially on higher levels. Are you against a paladin? Pressure the Shield. Against a Shaman? Pressure the ascendence. Against a warrior? Disarm/CCduring swifty macro, force shieldwall.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but those awefully feel ike pve's scripting to me.<br />
<br />
Now either come with a decent coherent post and refute my statement, or don't bring this argument up again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, but a lot of people lately prefer (good) mechanical keyboards. Ducky, Corsair etc. Would be fun if those for once were actually spotlighted as well, instead of the really really subpar Razer Blackwidow.<br />
<br />
And sorry.. &quot;We use Amazon so you can check the prices&quot; Please do for yourself. You will see the huge price differences between hardware in $, Euro and pounds. And as Womd says.. a 27&quot; monitor? For what? WoW? Yea.. let's not go there. And a really subpar 27&quot; at that.. Well I guess it works for some people. But with that price range, I expect a lot more quality. Not &quot;Well it looks good on paper&quot;</div></div><hr />

..<br />
Worldclass is irrelevant. There'd be no point to gear if it didn't facilitate success. Stop with the straw man.<br />
..<br />
mechanics or not the guild rollling in a sub 496 ilvl is gonna have a bad time in tot where the 515 guys are gonna breeze<br />

When i read this i couldn't help thinking of all the times i went to LFR/LFD saw someone in decent gear underperforming and using the weirdest spells (e.g. Rain of Fire on 2 Targets as Affliction or Drain-Life as Demonology). I dont say that Gear means nothing, especially now where MetaGem and Trinkets are improving DPS quite a bit. But this is just ridiculous ... Skill &gt; Gear, this was almost always true, it is now true and probably will always be true... except when we get to point where spamming the one and only spell you got is the best way to do damage (and even then enough players will fail to do decent DPS!).</div></div><hr />

For any guild that was behind the LFR unlock schedule on normal bosses, LFR was &quot;manditory&quot; to progress in raid reputation so you could unlock your VP purchases at a rate where you weren't capping VP and waiting on reputation. Now, if things had been &quot;correct&quot; at the start (current boss nerfs in place at 5.2 release, all VP purchases available at Honored) then I think LFR would have been optional all this tier for the bulk of Normal raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing dyslexic about your post. It's just missing the basics: correct spelling, punctuation, comma use, and suffering from the worst case of runonitis I've seen in some time.<br />

What you (and everyone else) seem to forget is that prices in US don't include the sale tax (that's similar to Europe's VAT), while European prices do.</div></div><hr />
