Poor guy. Three phase fight, pretty easy. If you wipe you must do all the phases again.<br />
<br />
Phase 1: Harbingers of Flame are the same trash from Alysrazor but more of them, just assign interrupters.<br />
<br />
Phase 2: The Tormented Protector should be tanked away from the middle. He'll root the entire raid then cast a 1,000 yard knockback that will knock you off the edge to your death unless you have his roots debuff on you. The roots also tick for 10,000 a second and should be dispelled after his stomp.<br />
<br />
Burning Treants spawn in the middle, move slowly and pulse a hellfire around them that will kill you if you stand near them, ranged should kill and knockback them.<br />
<br />
Phase 3: Volcanus himself summons slow moving columns of killsyou and pulses a steadily increasing AoE so you should bloodlust on him.<br />

Dungeon Journal bugs and accuracy<br />
We are looking at the concerns over the faces blocking the map view in the Dungeon Journal. We're aware of this concern and may provide an option to turn them off at a future point in time. We'll provide information on this though when we are able.<br />
<br />
As for the concerns over accuracy, there is always the potential for information to change based on adjustments made to the bosses and the fights. Overall though, the Dungeon Journal should be seen as an accurate representation of the boss fights and abilities. We have seen a lot of misunderstandings or inaccurate information provided via external sources and hope that the Dungeon Journal can better shore up those external sources with its information.<br />
<br />
As for some concerns over missing loot, we did purposefully leave out &quot;grab-bag&quot; items. Meaning, items that have the potential for dropping on multiple bosses were not added to the listing of items. We may choose to change this decision at a future point in time if we feel that it's causing additional confusion. For now though, just be aware that these items do not appear in the listed loot tables. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185427/can-someone-explain) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2795123655?page=5#89))<br />

25 Daily Quests Limit<br />
Is there a point in daily quest limits? Yes. Of course there is. Dailies allow people the opportunity to gain (in some cases) reputation as well as money or skills. We also don't want people feeling that they need to do 100+ daily quests a day just because they can either. It should also be about making choices on an individual basis about what quests you want to work on and still not get overwhelmed by the amount of dailies you feel you need to do each day.<br />
<br />
People have asked us if we'd ever raise the cap to this, and we can't say we never will. If the time comes that we think it's a good idea, we'll address the possibility then. For now, it's as it is.

It's actually floating in front of her I think.<br />

Anyhow, the post about dailies was a bit exaggerated, I think most people would be happy if the cap was increased by like 10-20 quests, they don't have to increase it by 300. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

You have to collect fragments from Rhyolith, Shannox, Beth'tilac, and Alsyrazor and then open it. You can see it on the map near Beth'tilac's area.</div></div><hr />

Without being perverse about it, I think it was a great way to display an early morning feel to it and a great way to show that maybe she is tired, or stayed up all night with how bright the imagery is.<br />

You're right. I mean, when I work on my hobbies and such, I wear a three-piece suit with not a hair out of place. I surely don't try to be as relaxed as possible when I'm already concentrating on small, intricate pieces to begin with.</div></div><hr />

The scenery is amazing and creative~ Even though i just don't see how the extra view on the bust contributes to the artwork more besides a sexual lure (which is oh so common and typical of todays artwork I just don't find it too original/innovative most of the time unless it's done in a unusual way), which is fine and all xD But i can see the early morning argument as well, but i have my doubts about that in the artist's mind ^^~</div></div><hr />

To answer your question :<br />
Yes it is necessary.<br />
<br />
Picture a hot day with you sitting in some work area, are you going to be wearing a lot of clothes? No, it's hot and they'll just be annoying and distracting you from what you're working on.<br />
After a lot of work are you going to care about your clothes? No, you'll be focused on whatever you're working on and you want to finish it.<br />
Now to the main question...is she showing anything that we can't see in WoW? NO, there are plenty of people that run around in towns with a lot less clothing.<br />
<br />
I think it fits and complaining about cleavage there is cheap and unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

How much excess body heat can you possibly generate doing figure painting? When I see people working with shirts off they're usually outside doing construction or roofing or something, lifting heavy objects. I wear a shirt when I draw and I'm totally fine even on hot day. I'm with the opinion that the artist wasn't thinking THAT deeply when drawing the picture and just threw in the tits for cheap sexualisation as with MANY other anime pics. <br />
<br />
We're entitled to have negative criticism of art so please spare us the &quot;no one's forcing you to look at it&quot; because that's not a phrase you can throw around when people are critiquing things.<br />
<br />
If you're working up a sweat just painting figurines while only in a silk gown then you likely have a metabolic disorder or a hypothalamus issue going on..</div></div><hr />

The thing is everyone has to turn his sound off and every time you bring a new player to the raid you need to tell him to turn it off. And someone will forget to turn if off. Naah, I'll stick to TS.</div></div><hr />

Is there a point in daily quest limits?<br />
There is no good reason to limit dailys. You could remove the limit and people still could not do the same quest twice a day. Once you are done you have to wait until the next day. You see, there is already a restriction. People can't get unlimited amounts of reputations.<br />
Questing is not the best and not only way to make money, it doesn't make sense to add all kinds of heavy-handed restrictions and limits.<br />
<br />
We don't want people feeling that they need to do 100+ daily quests a day just because they can either.<br />
The game should not be balanced around what imaginary people may be thinking. It's like limiting the number of hours people can play because someone may feel he has to play 24 hours each day.</div></div><hr />

When I see people working with shirts off they're usually outside doing construction or roofing or something, lifting heavy objects. I wear a shirt when I draw and I'm totally fine even on hot day. I'm with the opinion that the artist wasn't thinking THAT deeply when drawing the picture and just threw in the tits for cheap sexualisation as with MANY other anime pics. <br />
<br />
We're entitled to have negative criticism of art so please spare us the &quot;no one's forcing you to look at it&quot; because that's not a phrase you can throw around when people are critiquing things.<br />
<br />
If you're working up a sweat just painting figurines while only in a silk gown then you likely have a metabolic disorder or a hypothalamus issue going on..<br />
<br />
I don't see the &quot;no one's forcing you to look at it&quot; phrase mentioned at all in your quoted section. There are also a lot of situations that you're not considering that could easily explain the appearance. Perhaps she went to bed, woke up in the middle of the night with a sudden inspiration and then proceeded to work on it all night, while enjoying treats throughout? Before you decide to bash someone's art with &quot;the artist wasn't thinking THAT deeply when drawing the picture and just threw in the tits for cheap sexualisation as with MANY other anime pics.&quot; why don't you take a different look at it? That's quite an offensive thing to say to an artist.</div></div><hr />

He is right tho, stop arguing like that guy/girl is freaking Rembrandt, he just wanted to show some big tits and that's what 98% of the anime drawn by fans is about.<br />
<br />
The only anime I can remember that wasn't completely oversexualized and made for horny teenagers was Last Exile.</div></div><hr />

25 Daily Quests Limit<br />
Is there a point in daily quest limits?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no good reason to limit dailys. You could remove the limit and people still could not do the same quest twice a day. Once you are done you have to wait until the next day. You see, there is already a restriction. People can't get unlimited amounts of reputations.<br />
Questing is not the best and not only way to make money, it doesn't make sense to add all kinds of heavy-handed restrictions and limits.<br />

The game should not be balanced around what imaginary people may be thinking. It's like limiting the number of hours people can play because someone may feel he has to play 24 hours each day.And let's be honest, people have more than one character. I used to do all 25 dailies on 4 characters, but if I wanted, I could of done it on 4 more. Unless I'm grinding rep, I actually found dailies to slow me down. Hellscream rep and badge farming is the only reason I can see any need for any kind of cap, but then again only have a limited number of quests per day; does just that.</div></div><hr />

Why not limit all questing, then? Why allow so many alts on an account? These can be overwhelimg, too. <br />
<br />
<br />
What's with the anime infusion everywhere ?! What does Japanese Anime/Manga have to do with the WoW universe ? Apparently it's not nice/fun anymore unless it's anime style... I understand the ideea, they need to compensate ... but it really doesn't fit in. I find it amusingly ridiculous. And a bit sad.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of it, myself, but it's incredibly popular, all the more in the gaming community. I'd be willing to wager that more fan-art submissions have manga elements than not. <br />
<br />
<br />
don't get me wrong, i like tits as much as the next man - but it's just really cheap and unnecessary in this picture, which would otherwise be a nice piece of work. why put so much detail into all these little aspects of the picture, then put a semi-exposed breast in the centre that's going to demand everyone's attention anyway? the picture certainly didn't GAIN anything from the blatant sexualisation, and it LOSES focus on the other aspects of the picture.<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly. I love all the rationalizing, too. &quot;It's a hot day.&quot; &quot;She just woke up.&quot; Come on. I'm pretty sure the artist just wants to show as much skin as he can. Check out the photo on her desk. Don't get me wrong, it's fine. The artist can do whatever s/he wants -- I, personally, think it's trashy. And it's not just with this picture, it's everywhere, especially in WoW. Oh, vell.</div></div><hr />

What this person said. It's client side only. It's annoying in the video because fraps captures all local audio. But during a normal raid night, you never hear it. Hell, I didn't even know they had it enabled.<br />
<br />
Also, if you hear someone with it IN vent, it's because they don't have a headset, not because they have key clicks turned on. (Well, both technically)</div></div><hr />

It's client side, you don't hear other people's key clicks on vent unless they don't have a headset. If you're not going to use Ventrilo, I would recommend using Mumble. It's like you are talking to someone in the same room.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iindigo</div><div class="date">2011-07-15, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it funny that people so audibly complain about &quot;anime&quot; art showing up in Blizzard's gallery without first checking the nationality of the artists responsible for the art. If you look, 90% or more of the &quot;anime&quot; style fan art is submitted from those living in East Asian countries (China, Taiwan, and South Korea mostly). The best part is that despite anime and manga being a primarily Japanese style, Blizzard hasn't even produced a Japanese version of WoW… <br />
<br />
It's the popular style over in that part of the world, much as how the west is dominated by testosterone-engulfed, hairy masses of muscle accompanied by a more dark/gritty style. Just like the westerners that poke fun at the anime/manga style, many East Asians find our own overmasculinized style equally ridiculous and funny.<br />
<br />
In the end, art is something that is extremely relative to the culture of those creating it and consuming it. While it's fine to have a preference for one style over another you can't just declare one to be more &quot;right&quot; or &quot;artistic&quot; than another and doing so does a lot to show one's close-mindedness and ethnocentricity.</div></div><hr />

As for the drama going on about the first picture, I don't really see any other clutter in the picture. Sure there's lots of stuff on the desk and a half filled coffee cup, but on the other hand it seems pretty well organized for an engineering workshop! (you can see the pet bombling in the background). That being said, it's certainly not the only element of that nature in the picture. It appears to be an um, cold day, and she's showing quite a bit of skin. I can see the argument for it, but I feel the picture would have got the point across without the skin, and it doesn't add anything to the picture than if say she were in some mechbuilder's overalls instead of a half-fallen off nightgown. It's not my favorite picture, I wish it were less sexual, but I do like the blood elf engineer concept!</div></div><hr />
