<br />
Patch 8.0.1 - Build 27291: Group Finder Addon Changes<br />
The latest live build made a few more changes to the Group Finder. This was likely to combat group finding addons, such as the LookingForGroup addon (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lookingforgroup).<br />
<br />
<br />
Searching for groups now must be done manually. <br />
Entering text into the search box now must be done manually, you can't paste in text anymore.<br />
Accepting group members now must be done manually, as the Auto-Accept functionality has been disabled.<br />
<br />

<br />
Stromgarde Warfront Unlock Timing<br />
We’ve seen some confusion about when Battle for Azeroth’s first Warfront, Battle for Stromgarde, will open and would like to give some clarifications.<br />
<br />
Similar to other types of endgame content such as raids and rated PvP, the Battle for Stromgarde will not be immediately available at launch. Instead, it’ll open a few weeks later. Initially, the Alliance will control Stromgarde Keep (which allows access to certain outdoor content in the Arathi Highlands), while the Horde begins preparations to assault. Once those preparations are finished, Horde players will be able to queue for the Battle for Stromgarde Warfront.<br />
<br />
A few days afterward, the roles will reverse: the Horde will control Stromgarde (thus gaining access to the outdoor content), and the Alliance will begin their own preparations to retaliate. This process will continue to alternate between Horde and Alliance on a regular cadence.<br />

I highlighted the key word for you. Quick =/= Time Spent to report to investors. You have to think on the macro scale here, adding 3 minutes to creating a world group may sound small, but over the course of repeating the same shitty world quests 2,000 times for 2 years that adds up quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you're assuming people are going to still create groups...they're not. they haven't been creating groups since the earlier 8.0 changes to the group finder API. now i'm having to solo invasions because the use of the group finder tool is at an 8 year low. people who don't know what to name a group, or where to properly list it, or just don't wanna fuck with it, mean LESS time spent in-game<br />
<br />
people will just skip content, and that's step 1 of &quot;i used to play wow, but now i don't&quot;<br />
<br />
i just requested a refund for BfA, i'll keep my $50, sell my account for $2500 and go play madden 19 PC. it launches tomorrow, anyway. these idiotic changes that don't make the game better in any way are going too far. the whole forced horde vs alliance thing was bad enough, but yeah, i think this change will do it for me finally. the pre-patch was lackluster, they're trying to pretend that giving things back that they've taken away without reason is a good thing and not just correcting a mistake and i have no clue what direction they want to go in anymore. the BfA beta was not fun, at all. <br />
<br />
i can't wait to tell them why i'll not resub, wonder if they got a metric for that</div></div><hr />

who wants to work for blizzard nowadays ? Their Trademark of delivering QUALITY is long gone</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onikaroshi</div><div class="date">2018-08-09, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's evidence that the auto-accept is either unintentional or being set up as a toggle that can be turned on and off based off server loads or similar. It is highly possible that they want it turned off during launch.<br />
<br />
Someone a lot smarter than me lol:<br />
<br />
<br />
It looks to be unintentional. They are securing the Auto-Accept feature more in today's hotfix by providing lua access to a C function:<br />
C_LFGList.CanActiveEntryUseAutoAccept()<br />
<br />
I tried to bypass it with:<br />
/run C_LFGList.CanActiveEntryUseAutoAccept = function() return true end<br />
<br />
While this gave me the Auto-Accept checkbox when I relisted, the checkbox immediately un-checks itself when I turn it on. This is probably because filling in the checkbox also calls a C API function which checks the real CanActiveEntryUseAutoAccept rather than my attempted bypass.<br />
<br />
As C_LFGList.CanActiveEntryUseAutoAccept() appears to be returning false all the time, even when it should return true, I must assume it is broken. The function is either incomplete or bugging out with incorrect condition checks.<br />
<br />
Given that many of the more technical experienced GMs didn't realize the option is gone under normal circumstances that it should be available, this helps confirm that it's just a bug.<br />
<br />
We should be able to use the Auto-Accept button again in a future hotfix.<br />
<br />
There are also other possibilities here as well. The C function for enabling the Auto-Invite feature may also be possible to turn on and off server-side. The developers might simply be testing the LFG tool load conditions between having it enabled and having it disabled, and could turn the feature back on at any time.</div></div><hr />

Didn't they say they wanted the world to be alive and have people be more social? Hell, didn't they introduce like a poor man's Discord in-game?<br />
And now they (over)kill Group Finder?<br />

Exactly it was a very good QOL part of forming groups especially large raids.. With it gone expect a lot less large group pug raids like one has with world bosses and greater invasion points..</div></div><hr />

What I don't understand is, if it IS unintentional. Why do they not specify it? It's like your favorite pizza place announcing &quot;we will no longer serve pizza's with cheese&quot;.

No auto-invite ? RIP world bosses and most of the &quot;we don't care about the group comp&quot; content.<br />
<br />
Plus, this will only impact the low-stuffed guys. I mean, with the auto-invite enabled and no ilvl criteria, even low-ilvl people could get a slot (and usually, you don't even notice them as the content is faceroll-able). Now you'll chose, because you actually have to.<br />
<br />
What's the benefits ? Only the tedious time you have to spend to create and setup a group ? Yeah, half of the people won't even bother creating it. Either the quest/mob is solo-able and they'll solo it, or they'll just skip it entirely.<br />

I really don't understand how you can even defend that kind of things.<br />
<br />
It's true that it won't take that much longer to make groups. That is absolutely true. Problem is, it will now be more annoying to create and join groups.<br />
<br />
They had a system that was working and are straight up removing some QoL stuff. It's like if one day you'd log in to realize you can't &quot;repair all&quot; now and need to click all your armor pieces. It won't take super long to do, it is very much doable... but you already had a repair all button, why even remove it?<br />
<br />
You're straight up just defending losing QoL stuff for no reasons. Why do you accept to lose such things and nod your head in approval? It's like the government telling you that you will now need to go manually deposit their tax returns check (or whatever it is in the US) as they won't be using direct deposit anymore... Stand up for your QoL man, don't just stand there and accept to lose. You can't improve things if you take steps backwards.</div></div><hr />

Right, so 3 of the reasons you posted are the same thing. Don't list them separately in order to spin your narrative. I'm talking about Powerleveling, Leveling slowed down and dungeons XP nerf. Secondly, Old Raids takes longer and bear tartar nerf listed as things blizzard has done to &quot;make you play longer&quot; is just retarded. It correct that old raids takes longer to clear. Maybe 5-10 minutes longer. Is that gonna be a huge impact on your overall playtime? Absolutely not. Same goes for bear tartar.<br />

OT: It's so hilarious that people cried for YEARS about LFD and LFR being tools that &quot;killed&quot; wow because of their automation and now you guys cry over an automated part of a tool being removed so that you no longer can just ride past your quest NPC, let your addon auto-join a group, get insta-credit because your party members killed it, and leave.

<br />
Some of those boss names? Of course I cut/paste from wowhead to get them right.<br />
Auto accept ... I'm creating a random group of people to kill a boss, we have the boss down to 80% - I'm not interested in looking through people wanting to join at this stage, just let them join and get in on the action.<br />
<br />
This is where I'm at with these changes. I really don't see how removing auto accept and preventing us from copying titles into the title do anything but hurt the player base.<br />
<br />
Hell, even breaking this mod seems like a bizarre thing to do and I didn't even use it. Why would you not want us to be able to click on a quest and have it fill in the title and category for us automatically so that groups are easier to find?<br />

If you have problems with low ilvl, then (according to community) you are a cynic and elitist, if you accepted someone without really looking and he/she framed everyone, then it's your personal mistake (not system's), then next time you will take it more responsibly, if you have problems with help provision and communication in general, people who enter the group is better to know about this in advance. Nothing bad happened, less exploit/abuse, less brainless, but weighted meaningful decisions. Nothing wrong with that someone in some places decides to compel modern youth to do this, it's for their own good (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2419577-R-I-P-Group-Finder-Addons?p=49906271&amp;viewfull=1#post49906271). &quot;Who knew life, that is no longer hurries (https://www.behance.net/gallery/14732393/little-Buddha-Who-knew-life-that-is-no-longer-hurries) + (https://i.imgur.com/a47KQO7.jpg)&quot;.<br />

almost certainly they will resist recovery process, likely more than those, who left, resisted process of destruction. Because then it was done out of reasonable considerations, and now would be due to strong degradation and addiction = more furiously, rudely and stupidly - fanatically.. <br />
Although, as I remember, decision was made due to some technical changes (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2419577-R-I-P-Group-Finder-Addons?p=49909044&amp;viewfull=1#post49909044), and not because of developers' desire for attempt to instill foundations of social education to spoiled community :p<br />
<br />
ps. Process' excessive automation without its confirmation by lore/explanation/significancy component is evil, the more, the worse. Only the most necessary can stay, without which you can't cope. Time for taking a weighted decision can't be considered wasted :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You know, it was an option actually. You could do it without auto-accept, hand-picking your groupies. Hell, you even can do it right now like the good old yelling in lfg or trade channel. It was an option for group leaders to not do a completely dull work of clicking on everyone's nicknames to accept.<br />
I personally created autoaccept groups to speed up WQs a little. I can definitely solo them and now why should I create a group? To print the quest name by hand and then bring up the window every time to accept every incoming request? Nah cba.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rike</div><div class="date">2018-08-09, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder what good should come out of these changes to the looking for group cosmos.<br />
A mmorpg like wow is about playing with other people, finding teammembers, forging alliances and defeat the evil that is facing and threatening Azeroth.<br />
I don't think the various chat channels are a good alternative to a clean ui where you can get the required info: what do we want to do? What do we need? Who wants to join? in one go.<br />
<br />
If you have leechers that just hover 10 meters above ground and don't take part in the action of a quest or , more likely, a world quest, then just punish them by not giving them process towards the quest and therefore no rewards for being afk.<br />
These few players shouldn't kill the &quot;i need help with this &quot; and &quot;together we are faster and stronger&quot; combo of other players that fight and collect together.<br />
<br />
I cannot really believe that it is about performance issues created by addons either.<br />
You accept a quest, list possible groups for it, join one/create one, do the quest, leave.<br />
Between all these steps there should be enough time to avoid spikes, since you cannot do a quest in 10 seconds usually.<br />
Load should be distributed relatively equal due to this.<br />
<br />
If i am wrong and the server is constantly under heavy load from addons creating groups and searching for them, why not limit the rate this api can be used in a way similiar to the auction house? You can get all auctions at once, but only every 15minutes. For groups maybe a lower number would be good ;)<br />
In that way people can use it, enjoy the game and still play nice with the server ressources.<br />
<br />
Talking about addons themselfes for group finding.<br />
Apart from world quests, the original interface isn't always as helpfull as it could be.<br />
So to make things easier i suggest the following improvements to the game.<br />
<br />
- List DungeonKeys for Mythic of your friends, group applicants and guildmembers if they want to share this. So finding groups for dungeons you want to do gets easier. If you know that people have dungeonkeys you might even chain multiple dungeons together and your bond improves. Addons like keyed list applicants whispered keys in the group invite overview but it should be possible to view this in the standard ui already.<br />
<br />
- improve group filters for dungeons and raids. Let me filter for dungeon, m+ level range, itemlevel, roles missing, classes&amp;specs they look for , amount of players in the group, required achievments/kill count, language, bosses killed, personal account best time in that dungeon. So you don't waste time applying for groups that would reject your application anyway.<br />
<br />
That would kill a couple of addons people like and you can balance the load of the requests better in your own code.</div></div><hr />

I did more than 17.000 WQs and the leechers don't matter. In every 5man group there are at least two guys who do stuff. Yet it is faster do this way than do those cancer WQs alone... Sometimes I was a leecher too like all of us at some point when you had a phone call or had to grab some drink. <br />
So don't act like you are a pure snowflake.</div></div><hr />

Group finder destroyed.<br />
Taking away loot choices.<br />
Legacy loot making raids require 2 expansions later to be worth soloing.<br />

I agree with most of your points, but legacy loot states that you must be &quot;10 levels or more above the content&quot;. Right now, we are 10 levels above WoD content, and in BfA we will be 10 levels above Legion content. So if legacy loot is not active in WoD content right now, it definitely unintended.</div></div><hr />

They want to punish people who have more time to play, by making them wait, so when the new content hits the casual players who play an hour a day are at the same starting point than people who invested more time. <br />
That's another bad design punishing good players for the sake of &quot;equality&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, they just want content to last longer and not be consumed at once&quot; I hear you say. <br />
Well 1 hour + 1 hour + 1 hour still equals 3 hours of content even if you split it over 3 weeks.<br />
Also how about you design the content to last longer than 3 hours in the first place? As much as I hate rep grinds they were still better than goddamn TIMEGATING.</div></div><hr />

Ever filtered for +15 in the group finder? Well you most likely going to find much more than +15 in the title / description groups.<br />
Instead of improving BASIC features every tool like this should have they keep going gutting them because they dont like how certain things work.

It's faster than doing it solo. And since probably no player really likes to do WQs, why not optimize it and spend as little time as possible doing it? <br />

No, I certainly won't 'deal with it'. I like raiding and doing mythic keystones. Everything else is just busywork to me. Obviously, since I want to be as good as possible, I'm in a tricky situation. I don't like to do WQs, or LFR, or the daily heroic dungeon, but I also don't like to slack and feel like I could've done more to improve.

<br />
You did not even need addons, because even with the standard quest UI it was quite comfortable. But they also have ruined group making for people who did not abuse addons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's simple: If it's fun, nerf it. And why use a scalpel when you can use the axe. Disabling features to abuse it is ok, but instead they destroy all functionality that allows people to improve the crappy Raidfinder-system instead of only the features that allows it to abuse it. And why is it not possible to simply seperate groups created by addons from manually created ones?<br />
<br />
But hey, they are the same people that created BfA, so don't have high expectations to create something meaningful or practical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I legitimately do not understand why people need to use group finder for WQs...<br />
<br />
If I got specific quests to do, they are over in a few minutes, solo. What the hell is so important about doing them as a group? Are you that lazy you can't even do the whole of a quest on your own?<br />
<br />
I've NEVER used it, the whole of this expansion, for anything related to WQs. The only time I used it was for the World Bosses on occasion, getting my Field Medic title before 8.0 went live, and... I think that was it.<br />
<br />
If you find world quests so damn tedious: DO NOT DO THEM. If the rewards are meaningful, do the work. Deal with it. Nobody is MAKING you do the world quests, except for you. You just don't like the idea of doing all the work, and want others to make it faster.<br />
<br />
One reason is that some use items disappear if tagged / used by a person not in your group. So, while we have solved the problem of stealing mobs from other players by shared mob tagging, for other quests, you still have a competition instead of a cooperative gameplay. <br />
<br />
Also, why is it suddenly so bad that people group up for single player quests? People have been doing that for ages.</div></div><hr />

We have a bunch of different languages, so quest names and sometimes even mob names differ greatly, thus increasing the likelyhood of simply not finding as many (or any) groups for your planned acitivity. People who create groups put in typos or abbreviations and suddenly you cannot find them anymore. It reduces the potential group size drastically. Not cool.<br />

Guess blizzard is pushing for solo play, now make dungeons and raids also solo then.<br />
<br />
Group Finder delivering extra NPC's for your questing was the real solo play. Technically, they may have been player-operated, but functionally, did you ever meaningfully interact with them in the seconds it took to zerg the quest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interaction with other people begins when you recognise that they are there. You cannot &quot;not interact&quot; when others are present. Communication is not needed for interaction, not at all. You need communication if you have to discuss tactical things, or any other assignments (like &quot;split up so we get things done faster&quot;). You cannot have any kind of &quot;meaningful interaction&quot; if the content does not require anything like that to be completed. You don't even have to communicate in a dungeon if all people know their tactics and how to play their character in the respective role. You are looking for a solution for &quot;meaningful interaction&quot; in the wrong place.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because I'm the one who asked for this change and implemented it myself. If these group finder changes have &quot;ruined the game&quot; for you then you might want to have a good think about why you're even playing this game, and perhaps go play something else.<br />
<br />
The way you're acting is as if the lazy group finder is the most important thing in the game and the only feature it has.<br />

<br />
In the mean time I'm here sitting remembering 18 years back in the days of EverQuest, WoW's illustrious predecessor, a game where soloing was reserved for only a few classes because of their mechanics and abilities, and even then they could only use those mechanics in certain zones, for the rest of us it was forced grouping all the way through, these days it's different but in 2000, you had to have a guild, you had to be willing to group all the way through, and there was no such thing as a group finder.<br />
And if you're wondering lower level mobs that you could solo didn't give any worthwhile exp, the mobs that did give good exp, well there was the /con(sider) command, the ones that did give exp usually resulted in &quot;it appears to be quite formidable&quot;, &quot;looks like quite a gamble&quot;, &quot;looks like it would wipe the floor with you!&quot;, note that the blue color were mobs 1-5 levels below your own, white color were mobs equal level to you, and yellow were 1-3 levels above your own, and all (even the blue con) still required a group to kill.<br />
For actual group finding we had the chat box, the main general chat channel, and praying that there was room and all the good spots weren't taken and you went &quot;level 20 warrior lfg&quot;, or &quot;lvl 35 wizard lfg&quot;, etc. and you waited and 10 to 15 minutes later you repeated that if you didn't get an invite yet, spamming it was frowned upon and usually resulted in no one inviting you. (things like phasing, shards, and cross sever grouping of course didn't exist yet either) <br />
If you were lucky you played a healer or a tank class and when the original one logged off, the group went looking for one instead you looking for a group.<br />
<br />
My personal horror story of this was when comes from my main in EQ, my Ranger, in a zone called The Dreadlands, which at that time was the leveling spot for my level range, Rangers weren't the most desirable class, back then Rangers didn't use bows in EQ to fight (these days they do), they did high dmg dual wield melee damage, and had a few high aggro abilities, which could pull a mob straight of a tank, only way to stop that was to stop fighting and let the tank take the aggro back(no feign death like hunters in WoW), a ranger's mail armor was made of tissue paper, &quot;Ranger down&quot; was a common phrase and joke, because a strong mob could kill you in a few hits if you pulled too much aggro, oh and no threat meters to show you when you did that, only way to know when you pulled aggro was when a mob started beating on you instead of the tank.<br />
<br />
So the actual horror story, sitting in a safe spot in The Dreadlands (outside of the spawns and pat routes because nothing could be soloed there) going &quot;Lvl 51 ranger LFG&quot; every 10 to 15 minutes, for three hours straight, without a result, and that happened several times over a two week period.<br />
<br />
The group finder is still horribly convenient in my eyes, and a lot of you are making this sound like Blizzard have done this horrible thing to you and kicked your puppy in the process as well.<br />
So ya...this old MMO veteran has absolutely no sympathy for all the people whining about the group finder change here, heaven forbid that you actually have to do some work to make a group, let alone maybe talk an interact with your group members.</div></div><hr />

I didn't know 37 was grandpa age, but I brought that onto myself with the &quot;old MMO veteran&quot; bit<br />
<br />
And gameplay can be as engaging as you make it yourself.<br />
One could for instance instead of hitting a button at each world quest for a quick 1 to 2 minute group like it was, and now can't be done anymore, go into the group finder and say, make a group for doing all the world quest in a particular zone &quot;Doing all WQ in Nazmir, starting when group is full&quot;, or just group up with a bunch of your guildies for it, it's not like the old Tank/Healer/DPS combo is required for WOs</div></div><hr />

Now for the rest of you blaming a ADDON. Are you stupid? The addon made it so we could group with each other faster. That is not a bad thing.

If BFA ends up being a WOD turd, It would damage this community to the point I don't even know if it will return. Most of the people left will be the morons who think this is a good idea, and blizzard could do no wrong. My god the community would be the worse type of trash.</div></div><hr />

The same thing the want to accomplish by putting everything on the GCD. By nerfing the quality of life for players it will &quot;seem&quot; like they have done something awesome when they improve it down the line.<br />
<br />
Here's an example, people thought artifact traits were making them very powerful, in reality they were just mitigating the nerf from losing all the perks/glyphs/talents/abilities/etc that Legion removed. Blizzard managed to cut content and package it as additional content.</div></div><hr />

Shut the fuck up. I'm sorry some of us are not stupid enough to make this game more tedious than it is. You made the choice to play this game in a fucking moron type way.

A tool that makes the game more fun and less tedious gets removed. Ya, people are going to bitch about it. With good reason, Don't care if some of you never used it. The addon had what 30m downloads?

Right? Blizzard went from being my fav company to my most hated. If it was just this change, I would be like whatever, but the amount of bullshit that they fucking throw out, change after change that makes the game more slower and tedious.

Right now, we are 10 levels above WoD content, and in BfA we will be 10 levels above Legion content. So if legacy loot is not active in WoD content right now, it definitely unintended.<br />
<br />
On their original post when Legacy Loot was announced, they said you'd have to be more than 10 levels above the content to enable it. However, in the more recent post (I think it was in the patch notes), it said it was 10 or more. WoD has no Legacy loot right now at 110. I have a feeling this is intended, and it's dumb as fuck. We basically have to wait until the expansion after BfA to get Legacy Loot in Legion content. If that's not dumb, I don't know what is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, this wrecks the method for transfering old raid saves from alts to your main without having to have friends help you. Blizzard, why?<br />
<br />
If this really is an intentional change that is probably one of the reasons. I'm sure they never intended for people to abuse the feature to hold lockouts for themselves and clog up the group finder with fake groups just so they can solo old raid bosses faster. &quot;This is why we can't have nice things.jpg&quot;<br />
<br />
Auto-accept was a really great feature though and I hope they will reconsider this change, if it's not just a bug. Removing it is going to make things like doing world bosses so annoying, having to apply for groups and wait and hope they accept you before the boss is dead, but mostly just getting denied because it's a hassle to keep staring a the group finder and accepting people while you are trying to fight a boss, or because you aren't elite enough for them.</div></div><hr />

People like this is the problem. Blizzard has been fucking up with more than just this. This one is just the biggest and most retarded version of it. <br />
<br />
This hurts you also, ease of making groups through copy and paste gave you more options because more people did it. If they make GF tedious, less groups will be made and you fuckers who are like...&quot;Just type it out lulz no big deal&quot; don't fucking see the bigger picture.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been on our shit list for the longest time. Max cam changes, the stupid xp nerf with looms, fucking not finishing classes before the start of an expansion, telling demonlogy warlocks that they should not play that spec for how fucking long.<br />
<br />
<br />
This dev team does not have the skill or good leadership to make fucking wow decent. Even Legion was a copy and paste idea from Diablo 3, that happen to fucking work. With the other half, Ap and legendary, a fucking 13 year old could told that it was a tedious bad idea.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because they are totally ruining the game for me, unlike Blizzard... right? <br />
<br />
The changes previously were already overkill and stopped them dead in their tracks. The changes made here serve no purpose whatosever except to piss off the playerbase and make this feature unusable.<br />
<br />
I will take kicking a few server hoppers every other day (I haven't ran into barely any since the changes, or maybe any at all) to having the system completely ruined beyond the point of being usable at all. I'll blame Blizzard for this problem since they are the one taking ludicrously extreme measures to 'fix' an excessively tiny problem. This is like using dynamite to kill a cockroach when a shoe would do the trick just fine.<br />

Honestly I'm starting to think about whether or not I want to keep playing. Just because of this? No, not at all. but they keep making this game more and more and more tedious in ways that I've never witnessed in my 14+ years of playing this game. Their direction seems to be going this way and I'm concerned it's just going to get worse and worse while Blizzard makes atrociously bad decisions and ignores (completely valid) community outrage about it.<br />
<br />
If this is the future of the game, I'm not sure I want to see it. The question is, is this a fluke or is this what we can expect from Blizzard now? I'm almost starting to believe that all of this bullshit really is just about pleasing shareholders, and I laughed at that notion previously. Why else would Blizzard make decisions this idiotic and inflammatory to its userbase? What do they gain from it? <br />
<br />
I just don't understand.<br />
<br />
To elaborate: I'm not quitting over this, but this is pushing me far enough over the line that I'm starting to think about moving on from this game for the longterm. BFA is going to have to be pretty damn amazing to make me overlook crap at this scale.</div></div><hr />

This right here. <br />
<br />
Maybe server hoppers inconvenience you<br />
Maybe someone sitting in your group afk is a shitty thing to do <br />
<br />
but they aren't fucking up your game for years to come are they? Unless of course you blame them for Blizzards choice. I can understand that logic though, I also blame women who dress slutty for getting raped.</div></div><hr />

I mean I can see when something is going to be annoying as shit to players do I'd imagine dev's can see it too.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for the gaming industry, but overall software development is something like this:<br />
- requests/bugs come in.<br />
- dependent upon severity of problem/request it gets prioritized<br />
- project manager presents request to developers<br />
- developers present multiple solutions<br />
- one solution is chosen based upon the following: development time, development cost, client reaction to fix, longterm vs shorterm fix<br />
<br />
In this case, to me, it would seem that the problem is that addons are making it too easy to autogroup. The plan would be to stop addons from autogrouping people. The fix could be to disable those features to -only- addons. This may have been too costly to fix, or straight out impossible. The fix they chose - disable those features for everyone in order to stop addons accessing them.<br />
<br />
The developers may not have had a choice in the matter. They may have totally disagreed with the chosen solution. Timelines and cost may have restricted management into choosing this path.</div></div><hr />

So instead of having a discussion you are just going to claim he's whining with your &quot;Blizzard never do nuffin wrong&quot; attitude?<br />
<br />
He has a valid point. Blizzard took an extreme action which affects a sizeable amount of players when it didn't need to happen.<br />
<br />
You are literally acting like the people I mention on one side every so often. The ones that act like the game does no wrong and anyone with criticism is just hating for the sake of it.<br />
<br />
Bowser has actually made a fair point. I don't agree with him quitting though although that's entirely his decision but the move is an extreme one because they can't be bothered to deal with the small amount of leechers/hoppers themselves.<br />
<br />
Now while it doesn't affect me handwaving actual critique away is just ignorant on so many levels.</div></div><hr />

Then we are clearly seeing different thing and you are only seeing what you want to see to fuel your &quot;game can do no wrong&quot; agenda points.<br />
<br />
Telling someone to &quot;Shut the fuck up&quot; as you put it isn't helpful to the discussion. And just makes you come off as handwaving with yet again the &quot;game does no wrong attitude&quot;.<br />
<br />
I see some fair critique here. Just because you believe the game is perfect and can do no wrong it doesn't change that. <br />
<br />
And before you try and pull your &quot;BLIZZARD HATUR&quot; card on me note how I said this change does not affect me. But that I get people's points.</div></div><hr />

You keep claiming you have your fair share of gripes but when someone brings ones up you can't debate or handle you get defensive about it.

Don't worry, you'll get to have fun being frustrated as well when you apply to 5 groups (which is the cap) and no one accepts you because they either arent paying attention or just filled a 5man group just as you applied. You will get to waste time together with the rest of us, or just end up soloing everything.</div></div><hr />

Just because you can walk 2 miles to work, doesn't mean that you should if you have the option to ride the bus. It also doesn't mean the busriders are lazy. They just prefer convenience. <br />
The taken away features just made life more convenient for players. I am not sure how anyone can argue against making player life more convenient. No need to resort to name calling because you disagree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much.<br />
<br />
Blizzard seem to have this insane focus with &quot;MAUs&quot; recently aka Monthly Active Users rather than actual subs for WoW as of late.<br />
<br />
Plus with how heavy they've been content gating does seem like they are focusing more on time played than people playing as of late.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents though. I mean look at Broken Shore and it's 14 week gated &quot;story&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Obviously it is because the behavior you describe was uncommon enough that joining groups wasn't a complete waste of time.<br />
<br />
The fact that these addons were used basically proves that you had the wrong impression about their usefulness and as such, it is perfectly reasonable to think it is stupid to disable them, regardless of your pseudo-moralistic, holier than thou name-calling.</div></div><hr />

Cry me a river.<br />
<br />
The behaviour was common enough to make it perfectly reasonable to try and maintain it too, clearly. I'm sure Blizzard's got better access to stats on the matter in any case. Players have feels, they've got access to reals.<br />

<br />
I'd be willing to take the bet they are wrong lol<br />
<br />
For sure. I think that's probably it, and I think you're very right. If anything, group finder has helped with guild recruiting.</div></div><hr />

Surely the people who are willing to put in the effort to manually create and search for their own groups instead of being so reliant on addons would be a more admirable quality to recruit them into a Guild?</div></div><hr />

<br />

Clearly you're someone who fails to realize the irony and hypocrisy in their own retarded comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard seem to have this insane focus with &quot;MAUs&quot; recently aka Monthly Active Users rather than actual subs for WoW as of late.<br />
<br />
Plus with how heavy they've been content gating does seem like they are focusing more on time played than people playing as of late.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents though. I mean look at Broken Shore and it's 14 week gated &quot;story&quot;.<br />
<br />
For funsies, try requesting your account data if you're in the EU. I did, and they keep track of when you logged in to wow, how long you stayed online, and when you switched characters. It goes back atleast a year. Anybody who's under the illusion that &quot;surely this can't all be for the shareholders&quot; needs to look at the available evidence we have on hand right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest I've never cared about this sort of thing of how many subs a game has because there's more than enough people in WoW.<br />
<br />
But look at how much gating Legion has had compared to other expansions. Hell it even took the piss and gated an entire &quot;story&quot; by 14 weeks where only 1 week was actual story and the other 14 was just breadcrumb &quot;go kill mob/fetch&quot; quests.<br />
<br />
Nobody can sit there and say gating content by 14 weeks isn't to keep people playing. <br />
<br />
To be honest if I end up liking BFA but they pull a 14 week gate like that again I just won't stick around. Argus was fine. It was 3 weeks at most.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Well, look where we are now.<br />
<br />
You guys deserve this and more.<br />
<br />
Good god ... this and other comments ... the stupidity on the internet is alive and well.<br />
<br />
Nobody is trying to make everything take longer, that is how a child might interpret it I know, but it is not what is happening. The devs want more actual interaction between players and content that is not automated, so they are removing features or functions that move the game too far in an automated direction.<br />
<br />
Now, does this mean you need to like the direction they are going? No, that is subjective and you are welcome to your opinion. For me, I am glad they are making these changes and the game moving back toward a more personal interaction like it used to be.<br />
<br />
