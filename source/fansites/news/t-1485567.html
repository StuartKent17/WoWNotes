WoW Source Returns! Have Questions?<br />
Another WoW Source is on its way, and once again we’re looking for your questions. This time around we’re planning to feature Lead Class Designer Kris Zierhut, Lead Encounter Designer Ion Hazzikostas, and Senior Game Designer Brian Holinka, along with host Morgan Webb. This time the interview will be geared towards discussing class and PvP changes coming in Warlords of Draenor. Just like last time, post questions you have for the developers in this thread, and feel free to use the “thumbs-up” Like button to let us know if you’d like to see someone else’s question answered.<br />
<br />
Your post may be featured on the next episode!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
What is the diff between glyphs and talents? They seem to accomplish the same thing (mod spells) on a different UI panel.<br />
Talents are more transformative and strictly increase your power. Glyphs offer lateral customization and cosmetics (Minors). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445233889766686723))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
There needs to be a feature to be able to blacklist 1-2 random dungeons just like blacklisting random bg's<br />
Which ones would you blacklist? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445218592523436032))<br />
<br />
Make fire/acid/void zones really punish DPS by debuffing their damage output. Healers would love if you did this.<br />
In LFR, that'd punish everyone by making the fight longer if DPS were unaware; healers can at least compensate currently. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445212085052387328))<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you have answered this, but I was curious how many healers a mythic group should expect to have on hand for WoD?<br />
Likely 5 on average. Aiming to avoid some of the under/overhealing extremes we saw in the last portion of SoO. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445234954817912832))<br />
<br />
Is there a magic number for tanks in mythic raids? 2 or 3? Would like to know cause of planning our roster<br />
Generally 2. You'll probably be well served by having a third player who has a tank spec, but doesn't expect to always tank. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443401034581286913))<br />
Is that for fights that have 3 hard-hitting targets, or so you can swap to a &quot;more ideal&quot; tank class/spec for a fight?<br />
The former. We're not going out of our way to make 3-tank fights, but we're less constrained when it'd add to the design. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443473661790416896))<br />
<br />
This is a big issue. Going from 7-8 healers to 4-5 and vice versa is hard. Would like more consistency.<br />
I'd say 4-6, 5 average for Mythic. We're going to try to avoid 3 or 7 ever feeling like the right answer. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443789698050179072))<br />
<br />
When you design a fight, what comes first, the boss or the mechanics? Like was the &quot;miasma fight&quot; always going to be Malkorok?<br />
Usually the boss; occasionally the mechanic. With Malkorok we just knew he was a Y'Shaarj-corrupted orc soldier and went from there (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/444644111375544321))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
No spoilers cap'n PVP but how's Ashran going? Looking good on the pvp front?<br />
We are iterating on the design a lot. Really trying to nail a rewarding, persistent sandbox zone focused on PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444984547273240576))<br />
<br />
do you consider making pvp gems(esp.resilience)a more viable option? would love being able to change that more situational #scaling<br />
Don't feel like gemming is the right medium for situational choices. Glyphs and talents fit that niche better. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/444992506627756032))<br />
<br />
in all the other regions th PvP action is 90% horde,15m queue times are ruining the game for most casual<br />
The worst region has 55% horde queuing for bgs vs 45% alliance. This is queue data not realm data. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443824979314884608))<br />
funny how that doesnt match players experience with queue times, including mine, ohh well :P<br />
or that's the amount of imbalance that's causes these queue times. Not denying queue time problem. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443841505447256064))<br />
<br />
pvp scene in EU is 90% alliance. You're heavily nerfing horde racials and buffing ally racials. How do you think that'll pan out?<br />
EU BG queues have a very close ratio. Not concerned. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/445244537590390784))<br />
The high end scene is going to pick one side or the other and flock there. Mostly concerned with battle ground queue times. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/445246284014710784))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Are the embodied spirits in the Fallen Protectors fight dead, or just memories of the bosses' allies?<br />
The sha unleashed when Garrosh ruined the Vale claimed many victims, including those charged with protecting the Vale. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443931327234965504))<br />
But some of the Embodied adds in that fight are still alive, like Ren Firetongue.<br />
Ah, I didn't catch that you meant the ones summoned by Desperate Measures. Those are projections of negative emotion. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/443933581232971776))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor<br />
When MoP challenge modes are gone, will those reward skins ever be obtainable again?<br />
People who got 9 Golds will be able to re-purchase from the vendor if needed. Otherwise, not planning on it. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445212351147433984))<br />
<br />
<br />
Poll - Dungeon Blacklist<br />
This set of Blue Tweets had Watcher asking (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445218592523436032) which dungeon you would blacklist if you could. A similar poll popped up on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1477751-Which-5-man-dungeon-would-you-have-blacklisted) recently, where people also shared the reason why they would blacklist certain dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />

Fan Art - Warcraft Wedding<br />
Today we are looking at a different kind of fan art, weapons and other items created for a Warcraft themed wedding! You can see the full set of pictures (http://www.flickr.com/photos/sharelabs/sets/72157638328441206/#) and read about the creation of the weapons (http://www.flickerfire.com/flickersfancies/category/craftycrafts/replicas/).<br />

<br />
2nd and 3rd boss have mechanics that make the fight go faster. <br />
<br />
2nd boss: make the boss stand in the pool, he gets a stacking debuff that makes him take more damage. <br />
<br />
3rd boss: more bombs = boss dies faster. Some people elect to pull the boss with the trash and kill the trash with the bombs.</div></div><hr />

Holy shit that's insane lol.<br />
<br />
I feel Siege of Niuzao Temple would be 100% fine if you could just spam the gong like in CM, though would be easily abuseable by ragers and assholes. Not suprised SPM and SoNT are 1 and 2 lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2014-03-28, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Siege of Niuzao was probably the only one of the current 5-mans that struck me as being really obnoxious. Each of the 5-mans has a weird feature that can trigger a PEBCAK speedbump in one way or the other; SoN has at least 4 off of the top of my head.<br />
<br />
1) Improper pulling of the pre- and post-1st boss trash causing constant stuns on healers/tanks and causing wipes for new groups.<br />
2) You always get the person who throws the amber globs under other players at least 1 out of 5 runs on 2nd boss.<br />
3) 2nd boss, people getting cleaved to death by the actual boss.<br />
4) People who accidentally aggro all the pre-3rd boss trash, or tanks that pull the boss without clearing pertinent trash groups.<br />
<br />
ect.<br />
<br />
Most of the other dungeons only have 1 PEBCAK moment spots that are, honestly, not that bad compared to the myriad of ways that a Niuzao run can go wrong. Like, half of the group missing the elevator in Mogu'shan or someone getting chain-rooted until they die leading up to boss 2 in Shado-Pan Monastery.<br />
<br />
Basically, the more room there is for there being a moment where inexperienced players wind up being the bigger hurdle than the boss mechanics, the less eager people are to do the dungeon. The poll results seem to reflect this already. And where the vast majority of players now greatly outgear the heroics? Shado-Pan and Niuzao still have the potential of still being annoying if 1 or 2 key players (ie, new tanks or new healers) don't know what's going on.</div></div><hr />

I mean, there would be no shame in being dismissive of a stranger telling him what he &quot;needs&quot; to do in his job, but asking for feedback and more detail on this idea is the least defensive and dismissive reaction I can think of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless an individual over-reads any request for more detail/feedback as a loud declaration of 'HEY, PROVE IT' and take it personally. Which seems to happen a whole awful lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft themed wedding? That's extremely tacky :(<br />
<br />
I've been to a wedding that were held in its entirety (service and reception) inside of a bar, with everything decorated with plastic dinosaur toys and 80's punk band posters. The bride wore a dress made by her mom from old bandannas, and cowboy boots. The groom had a foot-long beard and aviator glasses, and the parents of the bride/groom danced to Jimi Hendrix songs. The wedding cake a big chocolate sheet cake made by friends of both bride and groom, and covered with multicolored sprinkles.<br />
<br />
Basically, the couple made the wedding as a big celebration of everything they, their family and their friends loved. It was pretty much the best wedding I've ever attended.<br />
<br />
That wedding just happens to be celebrating something that the couple loved between them as well, which happens to be World of Warcraft. Love and passion is never tacky.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snuzzle</div><div class="date">2014-03-28, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I can't think of a single dungeon I would blacklist this expansion. They're all equally fun, engaging and stimulating... which is to say they're not any of those things at all. If properly balanced they could be. But in all seriousness, unlike pretty much every expansion prior there really isn't one dungeon that makes me cringe when I see it pop up in my random queue. I wouldn't blacklist any of them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alltat</div><div class="date">2014-03-28, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There needs to be a feature to be able to blacklist 1-2 random dungeons just like blacklisting random bg's<br />
Which ones would you blacklist?<br />
<br />
Is it just me or is that answer a bit defensive and dismissive?<br />
I think the point is that since there's a new expansion incoming, it would be better to avoid making more of the kind of dungeons that people would want to skip. That doesn't mean they can't add a blacklist in 6.1, but for 6.0 it seems like that time would be better spent making sure the dungeons don't suck.<br />
<br />
Having a blacklist feature would give them pretty solid feedback on which dungeons people hate, though.</div></div><hr />

Lol, imo, ALL weddings are soulless and boring unless they do something that they really want rather than going by tradition. Nothing tacky about having fun on a big day.</div></div><hr />

Once you outgear them, nobody should be forced to sit around and hurl sap bombs at stuff while some panda and mantid trade jabs, or sit there while a fish-guy summons elementals that die in 5 seconds flat, one by one. I want to get in, get my JP and get out. A good instance is one that gives you trash and bosses to kill, not makes you sit there and listen to a story hundreds of times that you've heard before. Blizzard needs to realize this and let us move on when the boss HP hits zero and not put a bunch of instakill mobs in the door while the guy gets eaten by dogs.<br />

<br />
It's because the 2nd boss is the most boring and tedious thing ever. At least the RP event in Shado-Pan can be sped up by killing stuff faster, and you can even skip the 2nd boss's specials by zerging him fast enough. In Siege you are forced to sit there while the mantid slowly walk up the stairs. Melee can just go AFK.</div></div><hr />

I think it's pretty cool. I'v ebeen to about 10 weddings in the last 3 years because i'm at that age where all my friends/cousins/siblings are getting married. All of them were the exact same damn thing. Very formal, Church etc. Would have loved to attend something that at least changed it up. I tell you, I am not sitting in another church for an hour going from standing to sitting to kneeling 100 times within that hour and listening to some guy read from the bible the whole time. Thankfully it looks like there won't be another wedding that i'll have to attend for at least a few years :)</div></div><hr />

Just because people aren't voting for them doesn't mean they're liked. I hate that they keep pulling this lazy shit of remaking old dungeons instead of making new ones. But I voted for the one that was the longest and the most pain in the ass. The Scarlet ones are quick, doesn't change the fact that they're rehashed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2nd boss: make the boss stand in the pool, he gets a stacking debuff that makes him take more damage. <br />
<br />
3rd boss: more bombs = boss dies faster. Some people elect to pull the boss with the trash and kill the trash with the bombs.<br />
<br />
Exactly, the results of this poll show EXACTLY why players hated Cata heroics. The two dungeons that are ´winning´ all have bosses that require the DPS to do something other than tunnel dps the boss. <br />
<br />
oh wait.. I have to drop these bombs on the steps? Oh wait, I was supposed to pick up the landmines and throw them on the shielded boss.<br />
<br />
These two dungeons have the exact same problem as Cata heroics.. they become slow and annoying because 99% of the time, 2 of your dps are tunneling a boss that is immune and not doing the mechanisms that are required. As a tank, I can´t tell you how many times I did Seige where myself and the healer were the only two dropping the bombs on the stairs, while the dps were, well, dpsing the mobs running up the stairs one at a time. Or how many times I watched a hunter/pet stay tunneled on the 3rd boss who was immune, or had dps running around killing the adds and ignore the mines. Both the 2nd and 3rd boss are VERY fast if all the players do the right mechanisms.<br />
<br />
The devs need to learn that the most they can do with bosses is add aoe avoidable damage and adds. Any type of clicking mechanisms or doing anything unique to an encounter like the evolution beams in Cata do not work with DPS. If there is a unique mechanisms, it needs to be able to be completed by one player.<br />

<br />
I love when someone proves my point... read your last sentence again... this is the reason why people hated Cat dungeons and these two MoP dungeons... because even a year later, DPS do not know the mechanisms.<br />
<br />
hint.. all 5 people should be dropping sap.. nobody should be ´dpsing´ not ranged nor melee. if all 5 people are dropping sap, the platform is covered and stuff dies ultra fast. But again, like you stated.. instead we have afk melee and ranged who are dpsing the mobs one at a time.... and it takes forever.</div></div><hr />

It still takes longer than it should because you can only kill the mobs as fast as they come in.<br />
<br />
Cast your mind back to Zul Farrak's similar boss; standing atop the pyramid, a crowd of adds spawns. Only instead of waiting for each mob, if your tank and healer (and dps) were good, you could pull as many additional mobs as you wanted and make the encounter much faster. With this, all the mobs are non-interactive until they &quot;activate&quot;, so even if you're a full 580 group, you can still only kill the mobs as fast as they join the fight.<br />
<br />
Scripting in dungeons need to be something you can toggle at the start of the instance, or make it normal mode only or something. After your 100th time running an instance, listening to a 25 second speech is kind of wearing.</div></div><hr />

If you do that part of the encounter right and have the lower ramp covered with sap and hit the ones who are supposed to explode, it goes very fast because the packs are dying and the next wave comes.. It is the same way with the third boss, if everyone does the landmines, then the boss only has the shield up for a couple seconds.<br />
<br />
The problem with that encounter is what I quoted above, the guy that thinks melee can AFK. When that happens, the waves are taking maximum time because they are getting all the way to the top platform where players kill them manually and then the next wave spawns in. You are literally adding 30-45 seconds on each wave by doing it like that. If you stack the sap at the far right part of the lower ramp, they die immediately.<br />
<br />
But then I just disagree with the scripted parts. Sure, something like MT can be a pain when it is just an unattackable boss giving a speech, and I think the devs got away from that.. but as far as scripted encounters? they add something unique to the dungeon.. But I think it is silly that people are voting down a dungeon as taking too long, and then posting proof that they are ignoring mechanisms which make the dungeon shorter. Siege is getting the most votes because it has 2 such encounters. ´omg, the third boss takes so long, and I feel like I do nothing but kill waves of very easy adds that the tank could solo himself.´ well yeah, because the tank should be soloing those waves and you should be throwing landmines...</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are you finding this so hard to grasp? Even if you _ONE SHOT_ every mob, you can still only kill them as fast as they join the fight and become attackable. When you have to take a pause from pulling at your own pace, it wears thin. You aren't allowed to pull the entire group and the boss, even if you want to.</div></div><hr />

Azrile the sap doesn't matter, I could two shot an entire pack of mobs without it if they would run up faster. <br />
The whole fight takes a bout 5 mintues by default due to the silly RP, yet I could clear any other Heroic dungeon in just as much time as I can do that one boss.</div></div><hr />
