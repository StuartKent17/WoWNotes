Mists of Pandaria Cooking Preview<br />
The recent beta builds have updated and added several cooking quests, most of which take place in the Halfhill Market in the Valley of the Four Winds. The Nomi line takes advantage of the new Friendship system that is similar to reputation. In order to begin questing with Nomi, you must first complete the To Be a Master (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31521) quest and earn Ironpaw Token (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/402-ironpaw-token) x 100 to purchase Cooking School Bell (http://www.wowdb.com/items/86425). The quest requires you to have 600 cooking in every specialization. <br />
<br />
The Replenishing the Pantry (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31535) quest allows you to turn in a Bundle of Groceries (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87557) every day in exchange for an Ironpaw Token (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/402-ironpaw-token), which is the new Chef's Award in Mists of Pandaria. It will be used to purchase cooking ingredients from Nam Ironpaw, as well as a few novelty items (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/may/noveltycooking.jpg) which cost Ironpaw Token (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/402-ironpaw-token) x 50. <br />
<br />
Each cooking specialization has an individual level which determines which recipes you can learn for that specialization. Your highest level specialization will be your cooking level, which will allow you to learn any non specialization recipe that requires a certain cooking level. You can see the recipes that have been added so far on WoWDB (http://www.wowdb.com/items/recipes/cooking?filter-first-seen-in-mop=y).<br />

Why do we Identify Rare Items?<br />
Let’s start off small: Scrolls of Identification are no longer in the game. Unidentified items and the act of identifying them is still very much part of the game, but now when obtaining an unidentified item you'll simply right click it, a short cast timer will occur as your character examines the item, and it will become identified. We love the double-discovery of finding a present and then unwrapping it, but we don't think it requires a physical item you have to find and keep in your bags to get the same effect. From now on you'll just be able to inherently identify all your items, no need to carry scrolls. Your character in Diablo III is just that badass now. (Blue Tracker (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/225146-why-do-we-identify/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5573698662?page=2#33))<br />
<br />
Legendary Item Quality<br />
Who doesn't want Legendary items to be the best items in the game?<br />
Players shouldn't, really. I mean if you want all end-game characters to look the same and have on the exact same items by having a single #1 best item in the game, it's a good way to get there. It's a lot easier, to be sure, to just chase a single BiS item, but we really don't believe it should be a lot easier. It should be difficult to find and judge and compare and build characters out of a mix of randomized items, not just go after a tier set. <br />
<br />
Hah. Well, no one is standing back, every designer is in the thick of it working on future updates, patches, hotfixes, etc. I think it really comes down to a perception issue that color quality differentiation and name have made. If the items were called Uniques, as they were in Diablo II, would you assume they were the best items in the game? Maybe, if they're the hardest to find. But I think the point is that the hardest to find items are not in fact Legendaries, but perfect Rare items. It's less intuitive to not have clear separations of item power through name and color, and that's tripping people up to be sure.<br />
<br />
But that's not the issue here, the issue here is the legendaries are worse than rares and blues. And that should not be. Please accept that THIS is what players want. For once in my life I am VERY comfortable speaking for everyone. We're accustomed to the term &quot;Legendary&quot; actually MEANING something.<br />
And we've stated we plan to buff them and add more unique affixes.<br />
<br />
I don't know ... we're looking to buff them. Whether we guarantee a blue item dropping in the same difficulty/Act can't have higher DPS than a Legendary is still a judgment call we've yet to make. It'd sure make more sense to people who are stuck on item colors telling them which should be better, but whether it's the best for game's itemization I think is still up in the air. Giving players a clear 'best item' is not necessarily the best decision for the game and itemization landscape. <br />
(Blue Tracker (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/225145-the-ball-and-dropping-it/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5271604671#12))<br />
<br />
Auction House and Item Drop Rates<br />
I have ZERO chance to find a legendary, because the server has now adjusted the rates on the fly, because others have already found it.<br />
That's not what was said or implied at all, sorry if it was confusing. The AH doesn't have any affect on the literal drop rates of items depending on what's available.<br />
<br />
What I said, and what is true, is that with far more players and an increased proliferation of item trade, we have to factor in how many items are being found by players and how quickly a player can gear up by 'sourcing' items from others through trade and the convenience of the gold auction house.<br />
<br />
If we say &quot;a player should have X power in Y amount of time through drops&quot; and completely ignore that the time factor can be reduced by simply having access to more drops through trading and the auction house, players would be gearing up far quicker than we've determined they should. It has nothing to do with the auction house per se, but the general ease at which players have access to more items than they would without it and us needing to keep that in mind while balancing drops. It would be rather poorly thought out if we balanced drops completely ignoring all of the ways players can gear up, and trading is certainly one of them.<br />
<br />
Obviously everyone wants the best gear possible as quickly as possible, and us attempting to mediate that through design that takes all factors into account is not always going to be a popular notion.

Agreed, go to wowhead look at it on your class of choice. For example this set looks (imo) ok on a tauren but crappy on a human same with every druid set ever.<br />

Awesome? They're ridiculously-sized. Get disarmed? Jump at the guy, grab his dumb 3-foot helmet horns, and tug. You'll snap his neck!<br />

Are you bringing reality into WoW ?<br />
Cmon, you propably know that there's no such thing as neck snapping in WoW, which is why you post is rather pointless.<br />
You could as well whine about, what, let's say warlocks could do, if they had stealth.<br />
They dont, so stop it.</div></div><hr />

The Diablo news is between the WoW news, and being a blue post was mostly used for WoW news so it automatically makes me read it. Dunno if it is with many others. It'll keep getting annoying.<br />
<br />
The only thing Diablo and WoW have in common is that they are made by the same developer. But they are still 2 entirely different games, thats like posting Mass Effect news in SW:ToR forum, both made by Bioware but are still entirely different games.<br />
<br />
This is why I believe the site should be Blizzard-Champion instead of MMO-Champion. If its only gonna post Blizzard news, then this name may fit a lot better. Whenever there's Diablo news posted, they could just redirect the interested people to DiabloFans. It isn't hard to live up the MMO name in MMO Champion...<br />
<br />
Having said that, what couldn't hurt is that they post some Rift and SW:ToR news instead. They are both huge and succesfull MMORPG's, and guess what, they are not made by Blizzard.... crazy isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Also I don't want to bookmark a dozen pages for every game, its good if find everything here. If you aren't interested you dont need to read it, its not like diablo blocks every other game out here. Druid Set looks nice, Hunter set well could be a bit more creative as skulls with horns are bit overused in the decent hunter/Dk sets.<br />
<br />
For D3 Questions i just can say that these questions and concern are valid, because I for myself am a bit dismayed how few legendarys are dropping and what quality they have, i mean legendary = low drop chance okay, but legendary = crap, thats a motivation killer, what was the biggest moment in D2? Yeah that golden item drop and you know what it is and that its rather good and can compete with most of the runewords. Now its more like... ah legendary, gotta be crap anyway. Legendarys should be well legendary and some yellow items can be as good, but blues? Bitch please</div></div><hr />

Well, it's a website about mmorpg games, and Diablo 3 isn't one.. so.. I am guessing it's an external request. We saw many starcraft 2 news of tournaments when this site was owned by the gaming league thing.</div></div><hr />

I have both MMO-Champion and DiabloFans on speed dial. right next to each other. I regularly check both websites.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the D3 news thing (saying DIABLO3 NEWS: New Patch, DH Nerf QQ, Barbarian Buff QQ) at the top of our news thing, but can we please stop putting Diablo 3 news on our World of Warcraft news? I have never seen a single bit of news for Aion, AOC, SW:TOR, RIFT, TERA, GW2, or whatever on MMO-Champion's front page. I can understand maybe the security blue post, since it kinda applies to ALL things Battle.net related, however.</div></div><hr />

MMO-Champion would be a better fit than Blizzard-Champion for this reason, as D3 is a Blizzard game...I agree that MMO-Champion is an unfitting name for a website whose front page is generally limited to wow-related topics. I come here for wow news, so its lack of coverage on other MMOs such as Aion, Rift, SWTOR, Tera, GW2, etc is not generally a big deal for me, although I wouldn't mind more coverage on other mmo's here.</div></div><hr />

I think that MMO-C has been getting a bit crazy lately with posting D3 blue posts (exempting the b.net security article), and I don't see that as being healthy for DiabloFans. Entice people to visit DFans, but don't effectively be feeding on yourself by taking away traffic.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am disappointed with the Cooking Bell. I was rather hoping for something more in the line of Chef's Hat. Still going to get it regardless, but my enthusiasm has decreased a bit.<br />
<br />
As an FYI:<br />
<br />
Head enchants are gone.<br />
<br />
We decided that putting head enchants on the various faction vendors wasn't working well with our design intent for the factions. There is a lot of max-level quest content in MoP, much of it focused around the reputation with the new factions. I think it's really cool stuff -- worlds away from the old Argent Dawn scourge stone days. :) <br />
<br />
In previous expansions, the head enchants on the faction vendors served to force players into that content. You couldn't even choose which reputation to pursue -- you had to pursue the one with your specific head enchant. Our design intent for MoP is to give players options in how to play, and the head enchant design wasn't compatible with that. <br />
<br />
Once we decided to no longer offer new head enchants, we made the older ones non-functional or else players would feel like they had to go back to older content or be missing out on power. This way, helmets are just no longer enchantable and you'll have one less required step to get a piece of loot ready to wear.<br />
<br />
Shoulder enchants can now be provided by scribes, so those still exist, but they are also not part of the faction reputation system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do mind D3 coverage, cause there's a Curse site specializing on Diablo 3 so there is no need for dupe postings. I couldn't care less about Diablo, if I would care I'd go to www.diablofans.com, but alas I care about WoW so I'm visiting mmo-champion.com, and I get flooded with A4 pages about Diablo 3. The link atop the news to new articles on diablofans.com is super fine, no need to re-post the whole thing here.</div></div><hr />

It still doesn't explain why you won't post Rift, SW:ToR, Guild Wars 2 or any other MMORPG news. When SW:ToR got launched, the traffic in there subforum was about twice as much for atleast a month or 2. Yet you never posted, or atleast posted very few news about the game.<br />
<br />
Its not bad that WoW doesn't have any news, but you have to realise that there exist other MMORPG's out there that would love some attention. You may not like them, but it will live up to the site that focusses on MMO(RPG)'s. <br />
<br />
Also, Diablo 3 was not the only game with a lot of traffic. Games like Call of Duty, Skyrim, Mass Effect 3, you name them all, had tons of traffic aswell. But you never posted any of it, the only game you choose to post the enws of it was Diablo, which happened to be a Blizzard game aswell. <br />
<br />
Do you only look at the developer to post their game news on? Has Blizzard secretly bought you out?</div></div><hr />
