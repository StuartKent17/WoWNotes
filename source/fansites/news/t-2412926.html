I mean, as long as we don't have the connection/DDoS issues of WoD's LAUNCH, I'd say the pre-patch having all the horrible issues is totally fine. There's no new content anyway til next week, this is the perfect time for issues to arise, so I don't see the big deal.</div></div><hr />

Oh don't worry, I highly doubt they'll ever have as many people trying to play their game as they had trying to play at the start of WoD after Mists brought them back following the shitfest that was Cataclysm being used to tell casuals to fuck off.</div></div><hr />

nevermind launch, don't forget the clusterfuck that was patch 3.2 when they had more active players than they had server space so all instance servers capped out and you couldn't zone in anywhere, they had to rapidly upgrade server capacity to solve the issue, made raiding an impossibility until it was fixed.</div></div><hr />

I think after 7.3.5 changes more people (since part of playerbase don't like slow leveling) will be pro this change. Also scalled zones help a lot, they have some base for that.<br />
<br />
I think they should squish game big time - 'Base' game 1-40, BC/WOTLK/Cata 30-50, MoP/WoD/Legion/BfA 40-60, new cap 70. It's also possible that they already decided about level squish in 9.0, but want accustom playerbase with that idea few years before change.<br />

What about BC? The lag/crashing when everyone tried to go through the portal at practically the same time is the reason that Wrath had two starting points for each faction.</div></div><hr />

Everquest had expansions without level increases, it can work. Its not like we're getting anything new while leveling atm anyway.</div></div><hr />

Except that both squishes reset us to stats we had at the end of WotLK, not back to Vanilla levels. With that in mind, it makes sense that we get 2 expansions (Cata + MoP; WoD + Legion) then need a squish back to end-WotLK levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you forgetting the fact they added more difficulties? It came at the cost of larger ilvls/larger scaling, but in turn more people are raiding now than every before. Like he said, if they did 1% growth, you don't feel it, and it makes balancing raiding 100x harder. If you just grow said 15% over the course of an expansion, that means a normal raid after the first tier might be 1-2% more powerful than when they hit level cap, and that feels pointless.<br />
<br />
Honestly the stat squish doesn't bug me, I go from hitting for large numbers to small numbers, big whoop as long as the time scale stays the same.</div></div><hr />

Except in Legion we got way more powerful than in MoP when we needed the original stat squish which is the problem. End of MoP people were around 500k health, some tanks approaching / reaching 1 million with cooldowns. https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/wowpedia/9/9f/Item_squish.jpg<br />
<br />
And in Legion DPS players not even 100% mythic / heroic geared were around 4 million health.<br />

No I have played since launch. I mean in recent expansions. You would think after 14 years they would be better at this. BC and Wrath's launches were awful too. MoP I don't recall being bad. WoD was shit. Legion was smooth as hell versus this.</div></div><hr />

Not only that but sometimes an upgrade for you might be an even bigger upgrade for someone else and instead of feeling pressured to hand it to that player you might actually be happy to give it to that player.

A brand new player might be deterred by seeing such a high level they need to attain to play the endgame.<br />
Sometimes you go too many levels before you get a new ability, which would be solved by a level squish.<br />
If you thought things were broken in the past few days, the risks are far greater for everything breaking with a level squish.<br />
It also might feel bad to log in and be level 70 again.<br />
If someone has been away for a few years and hears about a new expansion with a level cap of 80, that would be confusing.<br />
The time spent doing a level squish is probably better spent making new content.<br />
<br />
Those are some of the dumbest reasons to not do a Level Squish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurr, a player might be confused&quot;. Wow, how hard it is to put on that in-game popup that we just had a level squish and a link to an article explaining everything? This is a multibillion company and they can't think of that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurr, it might feel bad&quot;. Oh, so just like a stat squish feels now? And how will it feel bad when max level is still max level? Jesus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurr, time is better spend elsewhere&quot;. I'm eager to know where BfA time was spend then, because this is looking like a dumpster fire so far. Just be honest with us and tell us you won't do it because it takes too much work and you can't sell it as a new feature for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter if WOW &quot;had worse before&quot;, it's more than a decade working on it, stat squish isn't something new, plenty of bugs reported several months ago and they still fail miserably. This needs to be pointed out. It will always has bugs but the proportions are pretty meaningful at this point and people has the right to complain.</div></div><hr />

Between stat squishes, spell removal, progression removal (things like the artifacts dying), its all regression regression regression, we don't progress permanently in this game anymore, level is the LAST thing we have left expansion to expansion, they remove that at it just kills what an MMORPG is supposed to be, permanent, sustained, character progression.</div></div><hr />

They would leave time to level the same, it would change nothing.

End of MoP people were around 500k health, some tanks approaching / reaching 1 million with cooldowns. https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/wowpedia/9/9f/Item_squish.jpg<br />
<br />
And in Legion DPS players not even 100% mythic / heroic geared were around 4 million health.<br />
<br />
So no, it doesn't make sense we got to that level nor does it make sense needing a stat squish because the numbers got so ridiculous in such a short time. That is Blizzard error 100%.<br />
<br />
We were literally fighting gods using the most powerful weapons in existence. It made sense to be doing massive amounts of damage from even an RP stand point. The shit we were (mostly) fighting were ridiculously powerful. Now we're not fighting gods and it makes sense our numbers are smaller even from an RP standpoint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly why they release the systems 1 month before the content, so you don't have to experience this when the new content unlocks.<br />
<br />
They have a full list of bugs, somebody is putting them in order of severity, that's why some bugs reported on beta are not fixed yet, but now that the system is live, the team is focusing exclusively on the bug fixing until the launch and everything should be fixed for launch.<br />
<br />
But to be fair, they should offer a subscription discount in this pre-expansion patch period... if not make that month free. But then again, players are doing their job for free by gaining beta and ptr access, so why would they? you can unsubscribe for a month and you won't miss anything.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they're talking about ideas on the traits that are supposed to come out to replace tier sets. (EN didn't have tier, so I'm not considering Uldir traits as set-replacement worthy. But if the raid after it still has these bullshit traits, then yeah, they failed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I don't care if there's a level squish or not. While I understand that the level number in and of itself may be daunting to some people, what really matters is the time investment to get from 0-to-X. If they kept the level cap where it is but significantly reduced the XP required per level, people would invest the time... but that would be counter intuitive to selling level boosts.<br />
<br />
For me, the best solution would be to keep the levels where they are but drop the boost price to something like $10. What do they care whether a new player jumps straight to the start of the new expansion? They're still paying their subscription. Ain't nobody (OK, hardly anybody) paying their sub just for the leveling experience through old content.</div></div><hr />

Two things I think would work well. First would be they could just lower the amount of xp needed per level. You currently dont do all of each zone anyway. The second thing that could work is to skip expansions. For instance, Once you hit 60 you use a warboard to choose which expansion you want to level next. You can pick any of the prior to current. Once you get 5-10 levels out of that expansion you pick another. So you only do maybe two or three expansions. With the way scaling works now this is possible. Because going Classic &gt; BC &gt; Wotlk &gt; Cata &gt; Mop &gt; WoD &gt; Legion &gt; Bfa is a bit daunting. I personally would do Wotlk then Mop then Legion and onto current.</div></div><hr />

Start everyone at level 55 or 60 and let them choose to level though the old world or go right into BC or Wrath. This would require a further tweak of the level scaling system but i think that would be much easier for people to swallow by lopping off the first half of the levels instead of squishing it all down. That would then allow them to do special things where people can continue to start at level 1 for some reason (maybe a holiday where you get rewards for passing tiers of levels? whatever)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the limitation that all loot will be set to personal loot so regardless of difficulty mode you will only ever get 1 item at most from a boss, most often nothing but gold, as to the second part, legacy loot mode is a loot option that is enabled in old content (10 levels or more behind the current level of your character) whereby when it is enabled and kill a raid or dungeon boss that boss will drop either all items on it's loot table (dungeon bosses mostly) or will drop the same number of items as if you were in a full group (raids/dungeons) thanks to group/master loot being removed (because we all know what a GREAT idea that was /s).</div></div><hr />

Understand totally they cant fold on every issue <br />
Just get the feeling every time from these Q&amp;A even when they know the direction<br />
might not be the best way they will do it anyway.<br />
<br />
IMHO artifacts turned out to be better than a lot of people expected.<br />
patch after launch feels more and more like one of the biggest reset buttons since tanaan jungle<br />
its almost like they know what's going to happen and ready for it</div></div><hr />

I had only one issue with artifacts and it was the early slow progression that hindered my alts so much. That coupled with Legos to make a class play well (I don't mean perform, but play like you know it was designed to) was really frustrating. Hopefully Azerite and the new artifact won't be as bad, but I won't keep my hopes up. I wish I had more time for my alts, but just pounding away on my main for those traits was brutal in the early stage. I feel like it should have gone a little quicker early on.</div></div><hr />

/S<br />
Honestly. The idea that it just isn't possible for a class design team in an mmo to keep turning out interesting class spells every 2+ years is ridiculous at best.<br />
<br />
There was nothing wrong with the pre-cata talent system, they just needed to actually invest the resources into properly developing talent trees for all the classes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renuts</div><div class="date">2018-07-19, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The downtime really isn't that big of a deal, and I think the majority of folks understand that. What is a big deal is the degree to which the game is broken right now that is unacceptable. The PTR and Beta systems are in place to stop these egregious errors from happening. Folks, they have had 14+ years to learn from their mistakes, and if you think that they didn't really know how broken Patch 8.0 was when they implemented it, then you are very naive. I don't enjoy the game enough anymore to put up with the constant disruptive changes the developers are making(even when they go correctly), and as such I no longer have the desire to see things through the difficult times just to continue to hope for the best like I always do. I struggled to stay interested when the class I played was continually gutted and re-gutted, and here it is getting gutted all over again not even 1 year later. I have no doubt it will be re-gutted again 6 months from now. It's not even remotely fun to play my main character anymore, and the changes that have been made that are clearly designed to force me to play longer hours, and to spend more money just to do the things I could have done faster a few weeks ago, continue to rub me the wrong way.<br />
<br />
I respect the folks who are satisfied with the game as it is, and I will always continue to encourage people who have the ability to enjoy the game, to do just that. During Legion I quit for over a year because I simply refused to financially support the developers. When providing feedback fails, what else can I do but refuse to support the game? Recently I have been playing for the last month, with the intention of playing in Battle for Azeroth, but I can already see that I am heading for further frustration and disappointment. I refunded Battle for Azeroth the other day, and now I can only hope that at some point a new development team will replace the current existing one, and do things better. The one thing about the Classic servers is that you know exactly what you are signing up for, and exactly what you are getting. With the live game, you have no idea what the developers will decide they want to do from one day to the next.<br />
<br />
I really try my best just to focus on what I enjoy in game, and I try to avoid negativity, but when every facet of the game is considered fair game to the developers, I simply cannot bury my head in the sand deep enough. It's not worth the bellyaching anymore.</div></div><hr />

What it really is, is laying the groundwork for them to not have to do it. They're not going to ever make the leveling experience less painful ever again, thanks to boosts and they're lying through their teeth if they say otherwise. <br />

Bull, fucking, shit.<br />
<br />
What a bold faced lie.<br />
<br />
This is the truth, this is 3 new trinket slots at best (sans secondary stats). The azerite traits should have been lifted directly from the legendary items of BFA. Better yet, 120 should have had the 3 &quot;best&quot; ones as talents, and some new ones thrown in, as it stands I am again thinking this will be a 2 month expansion, at which point me and my mates will find something else to play probably temporarily Monster Hunter, shortly after followed by FFXIV - which I've heard a lot of praise for lately.<br />
<br />
The Azerite system and the scrapping of artifact weapons and legendary traits all STINK of a lazy development team looking to simplify class balance - because the homogenization and ability culling wasn't helping their MAUs - they seem to think simple = less confusion = more players.<br />
<br />
Right now - prepatch my friends list is more full than it has been since Legion Launch, that isn't surprising - I will be shocked if I see half as many people online in 3 months.</div></div><hr />

This happens over and over and over again. They should just admit that they maybe aren't great at stabilizing patches, and feedback sent during beta testing obviously goes unread. They prefer to be reactionary than proactive, and that's how it'll always be with Blizzard.<br />

Blizzard can keep telling themselves that but the reality is we're not gaining a single new talent past 100. No new passives or abilities after 80. That's 40 levels of fuck all to forward as we level. They haven't added a new talent row since at least WoD.<br />

You must be fairly new. Tuesday was minor considering days past. <br />
- Wrath launch servers were down for a week. It also had a patch resulting in the infamous Corrupted Blood incident in which the government ended up studying to determine how the world would fair in an actual epidemic.<br />
- Cata had servers going down off and on for at least a week. There were actual lines out of the class trainer buildings, though I can't actually remember why we had to do that now. And then nonstop bottlenecks during leveling that resulted in an experience of doing nothing but standing around waiting on mob spawns.<br />
- MoP launch had smooth transition for servers, but had all of us bottlenecked onto a boat trying to complete a vehicle quest where all of us shared the same targets before we could even try to begin the actual expansion.<br />
- WoD Pre-Patch broke class balance so bad that some pure dps classes couldn't even beat healers until Blizz hotfixed it temporarily until launch day. Then the actual launch was downright unplayable. To the point Morheim ended up apologizing about it at Blizzcon.<br />
- Legion was the first time I've seen a legitimately smooth launch.<br />
- BfA Pre-Patch was down for a day, not even a whole day. I'd say so far it hardly compares to the disasters of the past.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm going to add, that while I don't necessarily dislike BfA, nothing about it has impressed me. The questing is good enough, but I'm anticipating a boring endgame unless they've got something big up their sleeve that isn't on the beta.</div></div><hr />

Forgot to mention that as Horde on WoD launch, we couldn't quest for a very long time because the interactive item that actually built your garrison didn't work (which prevented doing any quests afterwards in the zone since it was all tied to the initial garrison). Bunch of us try-hards grinded mobs from 100 to 102 so we could walk to the next zone for quests, and even then the garrison bug was not fixed.</div></div><hr />

Lets compare 2 quotes as an example<br />
<br />
If they do a &quot;Level squish&quot; lowering the max level I will literally quit WoW for good.<br />
<br />
vs (even on the same comment page)<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are some of the dumbest reasons to not do a Level Squish.<br />

Just be honest with us and tell us you won't do it because it takes too much work and you can't sell it as a new feature for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
And this is just one of so many examples even only on that few comments so far that are COMPLETELY OPPOSITE.<br />
Not even mentioning, that there are so many different facets even on that topic.<br />
And yet almost each and every fuckin dumpster thinks he has the only right way to answer for all. And maybe even calling names on anybody (in this case blizzard) if something is not done their way. (And yes, i understand the irony in using &quot;dumpster&quot; in that very same sentence myself...)<br />
<br />
People. What a bunch of egomaniac bastards ...<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
And on the release problems: yes, maybe they should give everybody with a running account in that time some additional free time or so. I think they did something like that back at WoD start.<br />
<br />
But beside of that: i doubt that most/any of you haters have any fuckin clue how hard it is to think really of everything in a Software so big and 15 years of evolving. <br />
Especially when overhauling a lot of things that involve ALL of it. And yes e.g. they did a squish before (and i'm not commenting on if squish is good or bad or anything). But Ion even explains that they did it in a far different way this time to make it more smoother in future, if they have to do it again. So there is no real experience for that...<br />
All of it is no excuse or anything. It just is a fact, that all of that is not so easy as some of you think. And Blizzard knows that.<br />
And .. wait for it ... thats why they are rolling it out BEFORE they really activate any new content... <br />
So that nobody (or less people) are interupted when playing this</div></div><hr />

- Wrath launch servers were down for a week. It also had a patch resulting in the infamous Corrupted Blood incident in which the government ended up studying to determine how the world would fair in an actual epidemic.<br />
- Cata had servers going down off and on for at least a week. There were actual lines out of the class trainer buildings, though I can't actually remember why we had to do that now. And then nonstop bottlenecks during leveling that resulted in an experience of doing nothing but standing around waiting on mob spawns.<br />
- MoP launch had smooth transition for servers, but had all of us bottlenecked onto a boat trying to complete a vehicle quest where all of us shared the same targets before we could even try to begin the actual expansion.<br />
- WoD Pre-Patch broke class balance so bad that some pure dps classes couldn't even beat healers until Blizz hotfixed it temporarily until launch day. Then the actual launch was downright unplayable. To the point Morheim ended up apologizing about it at Blizzcon.<br />
- Legion was the first time I've seen a legitimately smooth launch.<br />
- BfA Pre-Patch was down for a day, not even a whole day. I'd say so far it hardly compares to the disasters of the past..<br />
<br />
Comparing major updates (Wrath, Cata and MoP) to an extremely minor patch (BfA pre-patch doesn't add anything, no area, no new item, no dungeon, no questline, NOT EVEN A FREAKING PRE-PATCH EVENT, nothing, only stat squish and talent reshuffling, aka your random 7.X.X.XXXX patch), done<br />
<br />
Edit : to be completely fair, this patch looks more like a 7.3.6 than a BfA &quot;pre-patch&quot;, as we don't have access to anything &quot;BfA-esque&quot;. That's a joke. Pre-patch usually comes with Pre-patch features.</div></div><hr />

You seem kind of lost.<br />
<br />
This patch DOES come with an entire pre-patch event and areas of complete phasing, along with an underlying core change to how groups are organized, a redo of talents, a COMPLETE change to how PVP is mechanically implemented across a world space. . . . This patch was fairly significant in terms of technical challenge.<br />
<br />
Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there. All of the pre-patch content (and yes, we do have pre-patch content), is pre-loaded with the latest patch.

But nothing is playable, so we can't know for sure it isn't buggy. All the login issues, game crashes, stuff not working will all appear on launch, not on the pre-patch where everything exists but not available.<br />

<br />
There's no reason we had a stat squish so soon after the last one. The last one was in 2014 - 10 years after original game launch. This one is happening 4 years later. We should NOT have gotten to this point again. FFS.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to think a group of teenagers in their basement could manage a game better.<br />
<br />
How many expansions we got squished back to? 2? In wod I had Cata HP. Now we have cata HP again. They did not roll back current xp back to vanilla, do you understand how low level would suck havin level 60 epic items with 5 stam and 5 int? Tier up 6/6 naxx tier 7/7? Every mob and skill/Mob/item would have to be manully edited. Go for that. We wont get any updates for 2 years, but hey, they will fix all the over the top numbers</div></div><hr />

Yes, there is a CHANCE that something could cause an issue, but it won't be a system issue on like the level of WoD, it'll be a bottleneck like... WoD. You probably won't see crashes, just bottlenecks.</div></div><hr />

That's what can happen when you join a money hungry corporation that doesn't really care about anything but earning money. Some people just don't have skin thick enough to stomach it, and the people with soft skills (like CMs) are often the first to go.<br />
<br />
That said, I must admit this is the first QA in which they didn't give answers that were completely disconnected from what I think the game should be. But that might be just, because they realized they really fucked up and didn't want to add any oil to the fire by spewing bullshit like that we have more control over loot now.</div></div><hr />

We dont really need &quot;more&quot; stuff, we need more choice and just because we dont need more in Legion doesnt mean we need objectively less in BfA.<br />
<br />
This neverending kneejerk reaction...<br />
&quot;Hey should we add a talent row in BfA?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do we really need to add more?&quot;<br />
&quot;You are right, we dont, so lets remove some abilities and gear choices and lets just not replace them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yea, sounds cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
The worst part is this rollercoaster of buffs, nerfs and pruning every single expansion from now on because of retarded power creep via one single item everyone gets and loses after expansion. <br />
<br />
And that stat squish...they are doing it intentionally with insane power creep. It is not normal nor okay to get 10x power increase going from one end of expansion to the end of next one. Some 30-50k hp now? Brace yoursleves for 300-500k at the end of Bfa and Legion numbers in expansion after that. This clearly shows they do not plan ahead at all. How hard is it to set that this expansion is going to have 3 raid &quot;tiers&quot;, first raid will start at ilvl 300, lets remove warforging/titanforging, lets remove normal/heroic and keep only one but with optional hard modes, lets remove gear from LFR (it exists mostly to show non-raiders endgame content). So normal gives 300 ilvl gear (305 from hard modes) and 310 from mythic. Next tier normal 310(315) and mythic 320. Last tier normal 320(325) and mythic 330. Cut the crap about &quot;its not rewarding to get 1ilvl upgrade on an item&quot;...it is IF you actually need it to defeat next boss. Im okay with double player power over the expansion, but 10x goes out of hand way too quickly.</div></div><hr />

The game right now is literlly unplayable... whitch sucks. I was hopeing to get my last char up to 110 before bfa but atm you can barely kill mobs whit fully herioloms and enchants.,.. you die to random stuff evrywhere for no reason at all. You dont get anyt xp for completing dungeons like i start to wonder why and what you are doing on your so called beta testing.. cuz i highly doubt all this issues have been undetected... The item level squish was a change in the fture to make the futre bether etc. it was not about nerfing a class thatss fullly geard so he cant evne solo a mythic 0 dungeon... Stats nerf yes that dont mean you gonna nerf classes to the ground in the current content we are in and gear we got...<br />
<br />
wow,you literaly made my brain hurt from reading this nonsense,how is the game unplayable?since pre patch most of what I have done was lvl,did one from 101 to 110,did one from 1 to 40 ish and another from 54 to 83,had zero issues with killing mobs or dieing to ''random stuff'',some bosses in dungeons did an odd extra dmg but nothing unbeatable,and did you even listen to the Q&amp;A?dungeon xp isnt given at the end anymore,its given by the end boss dieing,and related to the issues that happened,he literaly explained why and how some were missed,seriously did you even take more than 5 minutes of listening?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) WoW should have never got this far in first place. It was once an awesome game, but as it usually is with all the neverending things, creators will run out of ideas eventually and tend to scramble good old stuff with innovations and/or bloat it with additions of new things.<br />
<br />
2) It's also a simple fact that if they keep raising the cap of everything just for sake of power progression, they will end up with immense numbers. Instead of partial scaling things back and forth, they should focus on EXPANDING the current game, not REPLACING it with newer content, effectively scrapping what they have done in previous xpac. But as I mentioned at the previous point, they will eventually run out of ideas, so the power progression (increased level cap and stats) feels necessary again.</div></div><hr />

Warfront = Ashran without horde players, Island exp. = MoP scenarios, WQs are worse than the Legion ones (and no more grouping... in an MMO), Dungeons have more trash, longer, and boring. Gears from the raid look like trash. PVP will hit itslowest point. Warmode option will be fun for the campers, haha they can camp eachother LOL. M+ &quot;bring the class not the player&quot; mentality will make it worse.<br /> 
<br />
Delaying gearing by personal loot is just a phatetic way to keep people's sub. The more you raid the less chance you have to get useful gear because you can get the same one again and again... I did LFR for 7 weeks I got the same back 5 times.</div></div><hr />

C'mon, this is a lame cop out and you know it. I don't have to know more. I'm not paid to program, and it's not a requirement to play a video game. If I buy a refrigerator from GE, and it doesn't work when it's delivered, I don't go &quot;Oh, well, you know, fridges are hard to design, so we'll just keep our food in coolers until they figure it out.&quot; - or claim that I know how to design a fridge to know it's not working. <br />
<br />
If they don't have enough people to properly test an expansion, which they've been working on for two years, with an extensive (and free) beta server and PTR, with volumes of feedback, then they need to hire more people, and/or replace people. In corporate terms, 15 years is a long time, for them not to have their collective shit together, and to have a multi-million dollar, two year project brought to it's knees over a new guild feature? That doesn't cut it. It's hard? So what? They're paid to work on hard stuff. We're not. (Well, those who buy it, I'm not one of them anymore). If they're releasing code that doesn't work, then it's on them, regardless of difficulty, and Ion's apology makes a mockery of your comments. <br />

I agree with you that they are better than this, and that this should not have been this &quot;bad&quot;, but bugs can still happen and a major problem because of coding, believe me, can still happen. There is not enough testing in the world they can do that can compare to what millions of players with different things they want to do could prepare them for every bug/problem, and not trying to be mean, but you can't possibly compare the making of a refrigerator with this :S.</div></div><hr />

That's simply not how this works. Please show me the refrigerator that's as complex as wow. <br />
<br />
If you haven't noticed... EVERY online game has issues when launching, even if the team has a ton of experience and tested the shit out of it beforehand. More people has never solved issues in game development and never will. Especially when it comes to coding... it simply doesn't work.<br />
<br />
But this is the usual problem with gamers who are extremely illiterate about game development... they simply can't put things into perspective and most certainly never will, because it's basically impossible to get enough insight into development without being one yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, they spouted this kind of bullshit at the beginning of WOD, and throughout it, too. Sounds to me like they don't really have much of story. Remember in WOD, when Kosak said &quot;Paladins would learn what it really means to be a paladin&quot;, and nothing about that was in the actual game? Good times. And, yes, they asked this in MOP. <br />
<br />
This all REEKS of WOD again. No story, no ideas, let's just throw a bunch of bullshit at them, and hope they're bamboozled. Patch 8.1 - the Instagram patch! <br />
<br />
The team recognizes it is fun to get new abilities!<br />
<br />
I guess? But not constantly. It doesn't seem like the idea of stability occurs to them. It all feels like busy work to justify their salaries, to be honest. I took a peek at the state of rogues right now, and...does anyone even play them anymore? They took poison away, now blade fury has to be kept up? They're changing shit just for the sake of changing shit. I got tired of that with my boomkin going all the way back to vanilla, with how many fucking times they've changed that class. I'm scared to look at what they are right now. <br />
<br />
Again, this all feels WOD-ish to me. They're making excuses before it's even out. <br />
<br />
My honest opinion? WoW is done. It needs to be rebooted, rethought out, retooled. It's time for WoW 2.0 - and NOT under the leadership of Brack, Chilton and Hazzaexcuse. Or just ended. What's the point? They killed off all the interesting characters except Jaina and Sylvanas, and they're unrecognizable now. Nobody cares about the rest, especially priest-boy. <br />
<br />
It's time to face the truth - WoW died the moment Metzen left the building for the last time. Hang it up. Time for something new.<br />

<br />
Pretty much this. As I mentioned in my previous post (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2412926-Developer-Q-amp-A-with-Ion-Hazzikostas-Battle-for-Azeroth?p=49768786#post49768786), WoW should have never got this far. But I am asking myself, would that be any difference from an expansion?<br />
<br />
To avoid this, the setting would need to be different. Warcraft IV could set the time and story few years later after the latest events in current WoW. Maybe on a different world, with different characters.. but it wouldn't be WoW anymore.<br />
<br />
It's really hard to invent new things for current WoW already, try to imagine how hard would be to make WoW 2.0 without the game being the same as current WoW. It's almost impossible to make a new game which is still WoW but actually not the same WoW anymore.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hurr, a player might be confused&quot;. Wow, how hard it is to put on that in-game popup that we just had a level squish and a link to an article explaining everything? This is a multibillion company and they can't think of that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurr, it might feel bad&quot;. Oh, so just like a stat squish feels now? And how will it feel bad when max level is still max level? Jesus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurr, time is better spend elsewhere&quot;. I'm eager to know where BfA time was spend then, because this is looking like a dumpster fire so far. Just be honest with us and tell us you won't do it because it takes too much work and you can't sell it as a new feature for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
They kind of put the framework for level squish in BFA with how they did professions. Section it off by expacs, so the overall &quot;level&quot; is the same but have UI reduction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
8 years experience in game development. It's even worse than you can imagine... and I never worked on something as huge as wow. Developing &quot;simple&quot; offline games is retardedly difficult, but live development is a whole other dimension of problems, that you simply can't test or even predict, regardless of the your experience. One of the major problems usually ends up being legacy code and wow has 14 years of that shit. Pair that with 2 years development cycles and you simply can't get done all that much stuff. <br />
<br />
Just imagine 3 people from different departments working for a couple of days to get a stupid icon working in game, because the engine is an old peace of shit and nobody knows how and who the hell implemented some hardcoded nonsense 6 years ago. Now project that onto anything in wow... no wonder it took them a while to implement a couple of new slots into your basic inventory bag.</div></div><hr />

I don't have to know more. I'm not paid to program, and it's not a requirement to play a video game. If I buy a refrigerator from GE, and it doesn't work when it's delivered, I don't go &quot;Oh, well, you know, fridges are hard to design, so we'll just keep our food in coolers until they figure it out.&quot; - or claim that I know how to design a fridge to know it's not working. <br />
<br />
If they don't have enough people to properly test an expansion, which they've been working on for two years, with an extensive (and free) beta server and PTR, with volumes of feedback, then they need to hire more people, and/or replace people. In corporate terms, 15 years is a long time, for them not to have their collective shit together, and to have a multi-million dollar, two year project brought to it's knees over a new guild feature? That doesn't cut it. It's hard? So what? They're paid to work on hard stuff. We're not. (Well, those who buy it, I'm not one of them anymore). If they're releasing code that doesn't work, then it's on them, regardless of difficulty, and Ion's apology makes a mockery of your comments. <br />
<br />
Granted, I agree with a lot of people, this isn't that bad, compared to the past - but it shouldn't be happening at all. This is an AAA+ game studio. They're better than this. And if they're not, they need to make some changes.<br />
<br />
Comparing a refrigerator to WoW is like comparing a lego set to an actual building - not the mention the impact of the two are far different (a few hours of missed game time vs spoiled food and return hassles). Hell, you even used &quot;putting food in coolers&quot; as if that even compares to what the downtime was like.<br />
<br />
They gave the reason why this happened and no, they can't accurately predict the exact impact when you go from a few thousand players on PTR to servers with millions of people. It's trying to work with a huge database of existing data on multiple realms and not fresh data on a low populated PTR realm. Hell, it's impressive that communities was the only problem out of the whole update. <br />
<br />
As for your standards, they're supporting a nearly two decades old MMORPG with a player base that is bigger than any other MMORPG and most online games. Soooo... It's not quite relatable. But please, tell me all the online games with millions of players that had a smooth, flawless launch. Call of Duty doesn't even have that and it's just an FPS.</div></div><hr />

The lack of database normalization really makes you wonder how much of that codebase was just a hell to manage and how much refactoring they've been able to do over the years.

So funny how people that don't know how coding or developing something works. I did expect, even taking into account how big blizz is (and that is one of the problems), that all these changes in live would break a lot of the game, why? because the coding and doing of a team of dozens of people, it is imposible with just testing with few people in PTR (compared to live) to know everything. I want to see you guys trying to debug one problem of your own 2000 lines of code (being made with love and good structure) with some friends, now imagine millions of lines of code and dozens of people looking at it, and also quite a lot of that code made by somebody else. But of course you people know more about it than everyone.<br />
<br />
Most code nowadays is auto coded anyway, much more efficient than hand-writing due to the high risk of human error.<br />
The main priority is robustness of your code, does it run correctly, does it hang in certain scenarios, have you revised every single scenario of which the code can be operated. Following a structured process will generate robust code, ultimately, reducing debugging to a minimal, testing will always be viable to validate your code, but debugging can be massively reduced.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzards main issue is not testing every scenario, they leave that up to the GP via Alpha/Beta testing and assuming they will report these issues, with such detail to build a debugging plan. But I’d imagine the GP are using the Beta for a pre-expansion experience, don’t think even 5% of beta players are software engineers... excluding myself; I’m more automotive and my beta playtime is circa 2 hours.</div></div><hr />

The heart of the Horde still beats, and there are plenty that will take up that banner for the Horde.<br />
-The Horde is a set of different groups brought together by a common interest.<br />
-The Orcs are all about Blood, Honor, Glory, and a savage existence. The Tauren, walking in the steps of the Earthmother. Other races, all working together.<br />

what a bunch of horse shit. The alliance aren't needing to 'look inward for what their fighting for', they don't need to, because blizzard makes the horde into the antagonist the alliance are fighting, with bitch sylvanas being the instigator in this current war. <br />

We're fighting because that's what the story writers have decided we'll do, and the linear quest design requires it.<br />

The faction war is old and tired, and doesn't even make sense anymore. The motivations and actions of major lore characters change constantly and arbitrarily just to move the bad plot forward.<br />

<br />
You must be fairly new. Tuesday was minor considering days past. <br />
- Wrath launch servers were down for a week. It also had a patch resulting in the infamous Corrupted Blood incident in which the government ended up studying to determine how the world would fair in an actual epidemic.<br />
- Cata had servers going down off and on for at least a week. There were actual lines out of the class trainer buildings, though I can't actually remember why we had to do that now. And then nonstop bottlenecks during leveling that resulted in an experience of doing nothing but standing around waiting on mob spawns.<br />
- MoP launch had smooth transition for servers, but had all of us bottlenecked onto a boat trying to complete a vehicle quest where all of us shared the same targets before we could even try to begin the actual expansion.<br />
- WoD Pre-Patch broke class balance so bad that some pure dps classes couldn't even beat healers until Blizz hotfixed it temporarily until launch day. Then the actual launch was downright unplayable. To the point Morheim ended up apologizing about it at Blizzcon.<br />
- Legion was the first time I've seen a legitimately smooth launch.<br />
- BfA Pre-Patch was down for a day, not even a whole day. I'd say so far it hardly compares to the disasters of the past.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm going to add, that while I don't necessarily dislike BfA, nothing about it has impressed me. The questing is good enough, but I'm anticipating a boring endgame unless they've got something big up their sleeve that isn't on the beta.<br />

Stating that BfA is smooth because the pre-patch only had a few bugs, it's a bit anticipating the overall mess that there will be next month.<br />
<br />
Never stated that it wasn't buggy -- we've already seen that it has bugs that are being fixed. I was refuting your point where you say that the BFA pre-patch is minor and contains no content.<br />
<br />
You're not going to get any agreement from me -- I still remember when servers were down for days, sometimes weeks at a time, and each and every single patch meant that you didn't get to play until middle of the afternoon on the following day (if lucky). Most patches go down without a hitch nowadays, and even this one was pretty quickly rectified.</div></div><hr />

Well considering the most recent launch was Legion. Anything less would have been worse as its only been one xpac difference. Its the worst launch in 2 xpacs but prolly still the third or second best overall.</div></div><hr />

Edit : to be completely fair, this patch looks more like a 7.3.6 than a BfA &quot;pre-patch&quot;, as we don't have access to anything &quot;BfA-esque&quot;. That's a joke. Pre-patch usually comes with Pre-patch features.<br />

Thank you for illustrating that you don't understand what a pre-patch actually is. The class changes went into effect. The &quot;event&quot; starts on the 24th.

What do you mean by auto-coded? Higher level programming languages and the use of libraries isn't exactly auto-coding, since while they help remove some tediousness they still require hand written code... They likely have toolsets that allow Game Designers add their own basic quest and narratives but new and revised features still require hand written code. Dealing with something as large and old as WoW's codebase with questionable programming practices (like lack of database normalization) and dealing with such a huge dataset are likely the reasons it's prone to problems regardless of how organized they try to be now and whatever new systems they create. They've definitely improved from launches in the past but it's not likely to be fixable without a new codebase with best practices at the start.<br />
<br />
As for scenarios, they can only test so many themselves in a game as large as WoW. Writing tests can be specific to what they're building now but hard to catch how it affect previous systems entirely. The whole time during Alpha and Beta they were still putting together content. Their team size means they can do a lot more but it doesn't mean development itself faster. The valid criticism is when they neglect feedback/bug reports provided to them, which happens a lot. Some reasonable (they get thousands of reports that are misconceptions or minor) while some are obviously high priority (game breaking).<br />
<br />
It's a combination of codebase, server processes, dataset and other things put in place to handle load/maintenance (like con jobs and caching) which is easier on a smaller freshly populated environment and harder on a pre-existing mega size environment. The fact it was only communities that did the main instability issue is quite amazing in itself.</div></div><hr />

They've definitely improved from launches in the past but it's not likely to be fixable without a new codebase with best practices at the start.<br />
<br />
As for scenarios, they can only test so many themselves in a game as large as WoW. Writing tests can be specific to what they're building now but hard to catch how it affect previous systems entirely. The whole time during Alpha and Beta they were still putting together content. Their team size means they can do a lot more but it doesn't mean development itself faster. The valid criticism is when they neglect feedback/bug reports provided to them, which happens a lot. Some reasonable (they get thousands of reports that are misconceptions or minor) while some are obviously high priority (game breaking).<br />
<br />
It's a combination of codebase, server processes, dataset and other things put in place to handle load/maintenance (like con jobs and caching) which is easier on a smaller freshly populated environment and harder on a pre-existing mega size environment. The fact it was only communities that did the main instability issue is quite amazing in itself.<br />

Yeah, something as large as WoW must be an absolute pain to review, and that’s fair, how can you test something which is updated constantly... you won’t have enough time, I guess this goes back to making your code as robust as possible to minimalist the ball ache, thanks for the information, was beneficial for myself unlike the above comment</div></div><hr />

Why am I not surprised that you bungled something AGAIN.<br />

No, it was beneficial, you're just too stupid to comprehend it which is why you work on primitive technology. Get back to torquing lug nuts and stop posting about things you're clueless about. AUTOMATED CODING OH. MY. GOD :eek:</div></div><hr />
