Vanion sat down with Ion Hazikostas and Calia Shie to discuss WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYuUD0o-Nz8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
It's been fascinating for the team to recreate classic WoW and there have been questions of if there are ways that this could inform the way that they think about WoW today keeping in mind the philosophies of the modern game.<br />
There are aspects of how to approach the outdoor world that could continue to inform designs in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
Communication for retail WoW is a bit more complicated than it is for Classic as most of it is based on listening and feedback without clear answers where Classic has a lot of clear answers. It's the difference between figuring out the answers and already knowing them.<br />
The team wants to sustain healthy communities and not have too many servers at launch that run into low pop issues once the initial launch dies down.<br />
The Layer system is only planned for the first few weeks. As players spread out over time eventually there will be no layer system, especially by when the world bosses are introduced.<br />
Each layer can hold the same population as a server from the original WoW.<br />
There will be no pet/mount shop in Classic.<br />
It's nice to return to a nameless adventurer, but in modern WoW there comes a point after defeating major lore villains where you can't be nameless anymore.<br />
The beta is small because they are using it to make sure that they have gotten everything right, not to address if the content is fun or to nerf things.<br />
Classic is about the journey and not the destination, and so players who don't have the time that they once did will still enjoy the ride.<br />
<br />

GamerHub TV Interview - Community Feedback for Classic Expansions<br />
GamerHubTV interviewed John Hight about Classic WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wc_iQFwWewQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The server architecture (population, etc) from retail WoW is used for Classic WoW.<br />
Quirky bugs that are not game-breaking/exploits were actually left in the game.<br />
Community feedback will be an important consideration for releasing classic expansions post launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GamerHubTV Interview - Design and Engineering for WoW Classic <br />
GameHubTV also sat down with Omar Gonzalez to discuss the engineering of WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XzsZvWb5_gQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The team took the modern code and layered the old data on top of the new code.<br />
The back end developer interfaces for the game is the modern infrastructure. The customer, however, sees the original game.<br />
The old code recognized realms as a single cluster of servers. The modern architecture is more shared and distributed, allowing the team to be much more efficient.<br />
The team recovered a lot of the original art assets from the old code. They deleted the modern graphics and reimported the old graphics just with modern code.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Staysafe TV Interview - Progressive Quests and Server Stability<br />
Staysafe TV interviewed Brian Birmingham and Patrick Dawson on WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHMd0KC3eTY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
There will be progressive quests added during phases as well, such as having the Naxxramas introduction quests disabled until its phase release.<br />
The Thorium quest hub is most likely available from launch. (The two did ask for feedback on this in the interview)<br />
The original mount system is being utilized, cheap training with expensive mounts.<br />
The team is taking a pass on modern WoW to re-visioning some of the spells built to address the issues of server stability when many people are in one area.<br />
The team has an estimate on realm numbers, but can add more based on the amount of players. They are trying to avoid having unhealthy server populations or having to merge realms down the line though.<br />
The goal is to not having Layering in the game at all after a few weeks when the populations smooth out.<br />
Phase transitions will happen based on player feedback and progression of the player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanion Interview - Patch 8.2<br />
Vanion sat down with the WoW developers to discuss Battle for Azeroth and Patch 8.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpTjssIsFPU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is excited to add Rise of Azshara to Battle for Azeroth as they have been hard at work on giving more player choice and things to collect in the new content patch.<br />
The 15th Anniversary Event will include a special raid that brings back bosses from previous expansions such as Kael'thas. <br />
Logging in during the anniversary event will get you the Nefarion pet while completing the raid will give you the Obsidian Worldbreaker mount.<br />
The raid is not a new raid, but a greatest hits of previous bosses back to back.<br />
The ability to visit Mechagon City outside of the dungeon could be possible down the line.<br />
There is upwards of 30 mounts coming in Patch 8.2. A lot of them have unique animation rigs as well.<br />
The team wanted to make sure that they gave a lot of new things to collect that felt unique.<br />
There are two versions of the Mechacycle, one of which is easier to obtain. However, the easier to obtain one is more broken down and junker styled while the meta achievement one is complete.<br />
The mount equipment system was designed to solve the water strider issue and will be iterated on based on feedback.<br />
In Patch 8.2, it will take substantially more time for the opposing team to show up during normal Island Expeditions, allowing a bit more time to explore freely.<br />
Heroic Warfronts will have a different flow in the battle to be aware of, such as utilizing resources right and defending your base from attack.<br />
Nazjatar has many different biomes to make it easier to navigate.<br />
Pathfinder Part 2 is likely to require exploring both new zones as well.<br />
The team feels that as long as you become familiar with the zone on foot first, it is not to early to allow flying in these new zones.<br />
If you don't like the companion system in Nazjatar you don't have to use it.<br />
There will be special repeatable profession quests in 8.2. An example is a herbalism quest in which you find a seed that you can plant in certain spots to activate a combat situation.<br />
Nazjatar has treasure finding gear that you can use to find buried treasure around the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't been on the PTR since it first went live, but does this mean exploration as well as the 2 revered reps? The second bullet seems strange, since exploring will likely be complete way before revered is reached</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fix the god damn drop rates, god dammit.<br />
<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
There's no point to making it easier to explore if the drop rates still suck.<br />
<br />
If they added treasure chests that guaranteed everyone in the group got at least one drop per chest to islands then yeah, sure, exploration would be great.<br />
<br />
But as long as the drop system and rates are as bullshit as they are now, both collectors and power players just want to finish every island as fast as possible; the other faction doesn't factor into that.<br />
<br />
I swear I saw them say at one point they'd continue tweaking the drop system as the expansion went on, but there's no sign of it in 8.2. Drop rates felt higher a few patches ago, and they're just adding more islands and more drops to the rotation with no way to target rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Classic can't come soon enough. Prime example of someone who never played vanilla. If you think bfa has gameplay issues bad enough that classic will fix and make you happy, you are high. Classic is a shell of what the game is now. Bosses having 2-3 mechanics, classes using 2-3 abilities. Stupid shit like reagents for buffs. Warlocks having to leave a fucking raid to get shards, Paladins being outside of combat as ressbots. Bfa may have gameplay issues. But classic hardly had a gameplay</div></div><hr />

<br />
Filling your bags with bull shit isn't RPG elements. It's ways to force players to either carry gear or carry shit that lets them use their spells. There is no other RPG I can think of that doesn't let you use abilities unless you have specific items. <br />
<br />
Classic wasn't an RPG. If it was, all classes would have their place. Instead, there were entire specs that were just not viable at all or ONLY viable in pvp. How anyone thinks that is fun is really beyond me. People complain about class identity now but wait till they play Classic lol.</div></div><hr />

I mean, in the end, it's all useless bullshit. What you consider useless and what I consider useless don't have to intersect. It won't change either of our experiences.<br />
<br />
That being said, if one team is designing this and the other team is designing that... The game director doesn't pick straws to decide which of the two go in. They aren't mutually exclusive. So your point, in essence, is fucking moot and just another example of a crybaby whining that other people got their toys before you got yours.</div></div><hr />

Have you heard of Dungeons and Dragons, the most amazing and best RPG game there is? if not, try it with some friends. The core material is free online and you'll get a deeper understanding on what an RPG should be like.<br />

And vanilla is much closer to that than the action game WoW is now.</div></div><hr />

and now we should wander for the map doing world quest turning off our brains, not even reading them just following the minimap and the quest tracking counter to get useless item, artifact power (oh no sorry.. now is called azerite power.. in 8.2 will be another thing again..) over and over. i dont want to save that turtle but i have to do that wq coz it gives AP... ohh so rpg..<br />
<br />
and now we just join LFR tools showing our r.io score, enter the M+ dungeon and at first wipe leave the group depleting the key (but is not a problem coz the key is not our!!)<br />
<br />
and now we go in pug raid .. BoD normal half-afk watching tv, kill boss and loot a 425 that not even mythic drop. totally worth doing hundreds of wipes in mythic . oh.. i killed Jaina mythic and got the Cutting Edge but ofcurse noone care about it anymore coz a 1/9 NM guy dropped the same item from jaina with higher ilvl not even knowing a single mechanic of the boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What part of CLASSIC do you not get? It's suppose to be identical to how the game was back then not how it is these days. The problem as I see it is that they're &quot;rebuilding&quot; it which means it'll fail miserably like everything they do.</div></div><hr />

Yea you're right most of that does sound like a lot more fun than just sitting in cities spamming LFG/LFM. And come on your Jaina kill was post nerf and titanforges aren't that common.</div></div><hr />

Just because it's foundation to the genre doesn't make it the best, otherwise nobody would bother making new RPG's. DnD has a lot of stupid quarks and boring nonsense in it. Way too much bad gameplay just for the sake of &quot;immersion&quot; in my opinion. I'm sure having to have your character stop for bathroom breaks and be forced to eat and drink to stay alive would be &quot;immersive&quot; as well, but it doesn't make for a good game. Classic was dull IMO. I like WoW in it's current state for the most part.</div></div><hr />

yeah i'm a bit disappointed as well. i wish they did it like how they did character models when WoD came out. a switch to choose either the new or old. but for the entire graphic subsystem. i have a rtx 2070, 1440p gsync display, and an intel 9900k. i would love to be able to experience classic in beautiful graphics that can take advantage of my system. the modern environmental graphics in the BFA zones are just pretty. shame we won't get that in classic outside of the newer water.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niwes</div><div class="date">2019-05-19, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30 mounts is just ridiculous. There's too much emphasis on &quot;collecting&quot; and not on &quot;adventuring&quot;.<br />
<br />
yep. sign that with my blood.<br />
<br />
there was a time in wow, when i had fun to collect things. since a few years they spit out so much collective stuff on you, that you either have no time for anything else in wow, nor another game, not even classic when it releases, or whatever.<br />
<br />
its just no more fun in any way. you are just running behind all stuff to collect. nothing of that „game niche“ feels rewarding or special or anything like that, like in the past. its just a dreadmill system for completionists. i AM a completionist. but it no longer feels fun in any way. it just feels like work.<br />
<br />
so, that said, there is ABSOLUTELLY no need to spit that high amount of stuff to collect down to the players. maybe they have the mindset of<br />
<br />
„but there are ppl that solely collect pets. omg, what happens when they run too early out of pets to collect ???“<br />
<br />
here is my answer for you blizz:<br />
<br />
„maybe they then start to explore and try out other aspects and niches of the game. which is exactly the thing why wow was and is great!“<br />
<br />
so, with that high output amount they only force pet collectors even more in this niche and mount collectors even more in that niche. which is counter intuitive in a game that has so much to serve. <br />
<br />
or in short: its horrible stupid and in the end of the day not good for anyone. just because its cheap to add collectives and therefore give the impression of „more content“ doesnt mean its good to do so endlessly.</div></div><hr />

BFA is trash, sorry. Far too deep in a direction WoW shouldn't have gone. Classic WoW really couldn't come soon enough.<br />
<br />
there was 1 thing for what i LOVED classic:<br />
<br />
i had time to play pvp or a twink or two. because there wasnt: do a trizillion quests for war campaign, and collect a million shit of pets, mounts and whatever, and so on. they spit out so much for one character to do, you even not have a chance to twink or pvp too. ofc vanilla had „grind mats for raid“ and „everything takes way longer“. but if you have done the few things vanilla offers in the week, you can go do something else. retail is an endless dreadmill.<br />
<br />
the absence of LFR, LFG, crossrealm, Artifact Power and whatever... is just a bonus.</div></div><hr />

So does that mean you will still be able to find that weird wall jumping spot between searing gorge and the burning steppes that leads up to the undeveloped area between several zones and run around in it until you end up under Stormwind and in a basement in the Mage Quarter yelling repeatedly as a Horde player and confusing all the Alliance until the guards find you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mayia</div><div class="date">2019-05-20, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda think if, 2 years down from classic people want TBC servers, they should introduce half the number of classic servers they currently have minus one, allow free transfers between the one classic realm and the newer ones so you can keep your character on the for example if there are 4 classic servers, we'd get 1tbc, and 1 classic would upgrade (the tbc would be classic and upgrade of course just a new server for that purpose)<br />
leaving 3 classic servers and making 2 tbc, and depending on player levels either upgrade another classic or introduce another tbc server, then when wrath comes along if its 2 tbc servers add one, and upgrade one.. etc, with allowing classic characters to transfer to the new wrath or tbc upgrade and tbc players able to transfer between them but not down, you'll never be able to transfer a tbc/wrath character even below 60 to the classic servers that aren't being changed.<br />
<br />
Of course if we are looking at 10 servers, it'd be 4 + 1 leaving 8 or 9 and having to merge a server or two but i think population will settle to around 4 classic realms, i'd say pvp pve, rp and a repeat pvp or pve. (depending on if people are hard enough! lol) i suspect it'd be 2 pve.<br />
Launching Tbc and Wrath might be tricky though because you have an influx of newer players who want to try it out for a while but haven't played classic in ages, maybe a limited time server should be made in the background funneling the players who aren't active in classic anymore to this server and it being marked to transfer players off of it after a couple of months if the players are still active, so you get the people coming back to try the new thing but wont stay long not effecting the other servers, but every patch cycle might cause the same thing to happen regardless.</div></div><hr />

wait what??????? outside the AP grind, you dont need to do any other thing to just PvP on the game. All the pet, munts and whatever are optionals OPTIONALS activities<br />
<br />
Hell, retail wow is alot much faster that classic when it come to participate on activities. You are just speaking bullshit. <br />
And doing i think 18 quest for a war camaping is a trizillion for you, you going to have a ugly surprise on classic.,</div></div><hr />
