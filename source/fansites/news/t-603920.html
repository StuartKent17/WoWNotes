Sunwell and 2.4 Details.<br />
Source - acaciaizm.com (http://acaciaizm.com/?p=309)<br />
<br />
The swedish magazine Level published a special World of Warcraft magazine. In the latest issue they included an interview with Jeff Kaplan (Tigole) about the patch 2.4, and obviously the Sunwell instances.<br />
<br />
Sunwell Isle<br />
Sunwell Isle will be located off the coast, north of Silvermoon, and will be patched in with patch 2.4<br />
Sunwell Isle will be a major questing hub with a 5-man Normal and Heroic Instance (Magister's Terrace) and a 25-man raid (Sunwell Plateau). The goal with Sunwell Isle is to close the Burning Crusade storyline before the release of the next expansion.<br />
There are still a few scenarios left that could be released to provide the players with more content if WotLK gets delayed for any reason.<br />
At the release of the patch, players will access a small expedition camp where they can start questing. However as the questing progresses, players will expand the camp and make it grow to a small town by retaking building to the enemies (running daily quests mostly). You can consider it as a AQ Gates opening event, the more daily quests that gets done, the faster the whole server will progress. <br />
The quests will end the Tempest Keep story arc.<br />
&quot;The Shattered Sun Offensive&quot; will be the new faction of this quest hub. It also seems that Aldor and Scryers will finally start fighting together against the new threat. <br />
Both 5-man and 25-man dungeons will be accessible from the start, but some bosses will have to be unlocked by running the daily quests (server-wide) and/or leveling your reputation. The 5-man instance will most likely requires Honored reputation with The Shattered Sun Offensive, the first three bosses of the 25-man instance will be accessible from the start, while the three last ones will have to be unlocked through questing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell Plateau<br />
Kael'thas will be one of the boss of the 5-man dungeon, he's still alive and he's now got a huge green crystal etched to his chest.<br />
Kil'jaeden will be the final boss of the 25-man instance. The other bosses include Brutalicus, a giant Pit Lord who has lost his wings, Kalecgos, a blue dragon enslaved by Kil'jaeden, a Fel Dragon, the female Eredar Twins, and a Dark Naaru.<br />
The 25-man instance will be slightly harder than Black Temple, and is tuned for Tier 6 geared players. <br />
There will not be any &quot;real&quot; Tier 7 set, but some of the drops will be set pieces (not necessarily class specific). The drops quality will be above T6.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Daily quests<br />
Patch 2.4 will raise the cap of Daily quests allowed in a day from 10 to 25. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Balancing actions will be taken in regard to PvP for certain classes.<br />
Blizzard have large plans for arena, and they will be aiming to bring it closer to e-sport acceptance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can find a few more details on http://acaciaizm.com/ (http://acaciaizm.com/)<br />
<br />
But that's not the end ! If you've been looking at patches carefully, you might have seen the name of Brutalicus somewhere ... yup, he's already in the game files !<br />

Alterac Valley 2.3 Calculations.<br />
Nethaera finally the promised post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3547877767&amp;postId=35472891146&amp;sid=1#0) about the differences on honor calculations during BG Weekends. It's fairly long and you won't have any nice Blizzard Quote layout mostly because it was bugged to death on this post for some reason. <br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
With the release of patch 2.3.0, players have seen many changes to the way that honor gain occurs in Battlegrounds and most noticeably in Alterac Valley. Many aspects of this battleground have been changed to promote a more strategic event and rewards players for participating in many aspects of the battleground. Despite the changes made, the overall intention of these changes is to maintain a level of honor gain that players have become accustomed to as well as maintain pacing of how long the matches may last. Prior to the changes implemented in patch 2.3.0, honor gains were less consistent in how they were calculated, there were long games, extra-long games, short games, and holiday bonus honor calculations all factored in. With the patch, we have better simplified and defined this for active participants in these matches.<br />
<br />
With these changes has also come some confusion in regard to where honor bonus comes from during holiday weekends as well as how best for players to optimize gaining bonus honor within the battlegrounds. To help clear up this confusion, we have taken the time to put together more information.<br />
<br />
Diminishing Returns<br />
<br />
It’s important for players to understand the nature of gaining honor and what role diminishing returns plays with this. Diminishing returns on honor occurs over time as you kill the same opponent. For each kill you make past the initial kill, the honor gained for it is reduced by 10%. After ten kills of the same opponent, that player is no longer worth any honor.<br />
<br />
Estimated Honor<br />
<br />
Estimated Honor will show an amount of honor that does not factor in diminishing returns. This number can be less depending on whether or not you had a lot of kills where diminishing returns were applied. Honor is shared among players in a Raid when they are within range of a kill. When fractions of a kill or decimal amounts of honor are gained by a kill, the User Interface will round the estimated honor up to show one Honor point gained. Given enough time what shows as ten Honor points, could actually only be five Honor points gained.<br />
<br />
Daily honor calculations can also cause estimated honor to appear larger than what it actually is. If a player plays prior to the honor calculations being run, and then during or shortly after, the estimated honor may appear as a part of the previous day’s totals. In actuality, this honor applies to the next day and will be correctly calculated the next night when the next batch of honor calculations are run.<br />
<br />
Regular Honor vs. Holiday Honor<br />
<br />
Some weekends are considered Holiday weekends for a particular battleground. Envoys for the holiday battleground will be located within the major cities. Holiday weekends grant bonus honor for meeting particular goals within the battleground.<br />
<br />
The chart below shows the amount of regular honor and holiday bonus honor for each of the battlegrounds as well as the reputation gains.<br />
<br />
It is important to note the following: one kill= 20.9 honor at level 70.<br />
<br />
*Map Complete refers to the bonus honor awarded on holiday weekends for both the winning and losing teams when the match has concluded.<br />

You bet. Otherwise the QQ from all people that won't ever raid Sunwell will be too much to bare for Blizz.<br />
<br />
Oh, and ofc there will be season 4, featuring loot of much higher quality than Sunwell, since getting a good arena rating with some 4 other people is that much harder than coordinated raids with 24 ppl 6 days a week ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There has been no mention of new badge rewards. Honestly, most guilds who are not heavy in the 25 man content, have not progressed far into ZA yet. The new 5 man, and raising the daily quest cap to 25 (little TOO high imo), will give people more than enough to wrap their heads around until WotLK.<br />
<br />
As for the release of WotLK, it does not mean that it is too far away. Yes, blizzard has said they have learned from Naxx, and want to allow a decent amount of players to experience the new content. This does not mean, however, that they are going to sit on sunwell forever. Many of the real hardcore guilds have lost raiders after clearing BT, just from boredom. Also remember that 2.4 (release of Sunwell), is the last major patch before WotLK. This is the timeline I can imagine in my head:<br />
<br />
PTR 2.4: Probably a month<br />
Release 2.4<br />
Fix 2.4: probably in 2 minor patches. probably 3 weeks to 1 month to get all that done.<br />
Beta test WotLK. This will be the longest wait. Probably 3 to 4 months. <br />
Release WotLK. <br />
With all this taken into account, this means the next expansion could come out as soon as July (6 months after the release of 2.4 on the ptr). With this said, I would put my money on August. Blizzard had made a statement just after the release of BC, that they intended to add a new expansion every year. An August release date would make that true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
perhaps it was also mean 2.2k ratings for weapons and 2.4k for shoulders :P<br />
if that were the case i don't think you would QQ so much, especially with the new combination or personal and team rating. also s4 will not launch with sunwell, but 2-4 weeks after it as was done with s3 in the most recent major patch. depends on the release date of course, but if it comes quick enough very few people will be full s3 with 5k points stocked, meaning arena gear will fall far behind what is available from pve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cannot you still abuse system like that:<br />
1) Cheat your personal rating.<br />
2) Buy high rating team.<br />
So you have both ratings?<br />
<br />
Anyhow they should replace crap arena with something like rated BG. &quot;E-sport&quot; lol, WoW is so crap to watch, Starcraft match is x1000 more enjoyable, WC3 match is x100 more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

So you have both ratings. Arena sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
yes you can, but its much harder :P<br />
<br />
also how long will it take to buy 2.2k or 2.4k and how much would it cost. we're almost a month into this season and my team tapped 2.1k once. 1850 is already a joke to buy and 2k is quickly approaching that. i hope blizzard has an answer for 'cheating' personal rating soon :/ it just totally destroyed their idea of keeping certain gear exclusive. <br />
<br />
as for the arena sucks comment, just your opinion i suppose :P</div></div><hr />

sadly the days of world pvp ended with the opening of the AQ gates, when silithus crashed every 5 mins and blizz realized they couldn't support large scale pvp ;)<br />
<br />
however i think our idea is interesting. add a queue for rated match to the BG masters. then your guild, or premade group of 10/15/40 can engage in meaningful battlegrounds, where the change is a large change in honor or perhaps arena points?<br />
<br />
then you would actually see new strategies and great matches in battlegrounds, as opposed to pugging when anywhere from 10-30% of the bg is afk botting. personally i think that would be a great idea, you should suggest that somewhere more official :P the obvious problem of course becomes the exploiting that takes place in current battlegrounds, such as capping towers in eots from far away, intervening with the flag up the GY for a quick cap in wsg, or the still popular bear/gnome cap in AB. blizz would have to iron out some things in BG's to avoid these exploits, but i think it would be really fun to have BG's be more about skill and teamwork and winning than just putting your time in to get the gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that being said sending 20 to galv and 20 to drek for alliance, or bel and vand for horde, would actually yield more honor than if everything were destroyed, and games would be &lt; 5 mins, meaning huge honor in a short amount of time. this is possibly part of the reason that group AV no longer exists, as blizzard scaled the honor to represent pugs and longer games. <br />
<br />
lastly, honor in AB and EOTS is given out at 50% more win or loss, so that is still your safest bet for pugging on weekends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more like blizzard need to lower the honor from AV when it's not holyday and the give more when it actually is. Because like it is not AV gives way too much honor compared to the other battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
qft, and technically its 84 honor. normal AV, if rushed or played properly, will yield far more xp/hour compared to any other BG, at least as a pug. the reason it probably does it is because it can only be pugged (sort of). also premades will always farm honor faster than pug, regardless of what weekend it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
naxx gear was not useless. might of menethil competed with felsteel reaper and other crafted 70 weapons early after the release of TBC, 93 dps was way better than that lvl 61 or 62 blue from ramparts :P same is true of things like lifegiving gem and some others...however, to stretch a season THAT long is unrealistic. people are expecting 2.4 and sunwell in 3-4 months, which equates roughly with how long seasons are. no reason not to release a s4 even with no equiv t7, because at this rate everyone will have full s3 and w/e else in time for WotLK, but perhaps blizz is looking to go that route to give everyone an even cleaner slate 70-80 and they did 60-70.<br />
<br />
perhaps you will see a basic set or some smaller upgrades in arena, but perhaps blizzard is gonna let everyone get the gear to have a more even level arena system in terms of even gear.</div></div><hr />

WotLK will probably still take 7 months+ to arrive. Personally I'm betting on 10 months. October 2008.<br />

<br />
Blizzard already posted that a new season of Arena does not necessarily have to come with a new set of gear.<br />
Personally, gear should be used through 2 seasons IMO. S1 gear for S1 &amp; S2, S3 gear for S3 &amp; S4, and so on.<br />
<br />
You might see them use this loophole they posted about earlier because making a new level of tiered gear every season might cause them to produce some pretty horrific 25-man encounters.<br />
<br />
And let's not kid ourselves, while there are some excellent players in the Arena competition, most people get this gear with minimal effort. I anticipate S3 gear being used for S4 if they do have an S4 prior to a WotLK release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
WoW has a lot of problems when it comes to being accepted as a genuine eSport. <br />
<br />
Even though blizzard can control the gear available at tournaments the fact still remains that the qualification rounds have no such fairness. Season to season the previous winners get a huge boost because they will have the best PvP gear at the start. This means that any other teams start at an inherent handicap. Take for example a game like Counterstrike, if you want to hold a counterstrike tournament you can hold a series of qualification rounds and, other than their skills all teams start out equally. Right now WoW has no method to do the same thing, nobody except blizzard can host WoW arena matches and even if they did, the teams start in an inherently unbalanced state. I am guessing Blizzard also face various liability issues even if they were willing to hold such qualification rounds since they would probably be responsible for making sure participants were of appropriate ages etc. Requirements which could vary from country to country.<br />
<br />
For item fairness there are a couple of oft voiced complaints:<br />
- People complain about the huge barrier to entry, starting out in arena now is a huge undertaking, huge amounts of honor to farm just to get your S1 gear to maybe be competitive, after that you need to farm honor to get the S3 gear. The best anyone can realistically hope for is that they can gear up over one season and be competitive the next.<br />
- People complain that some of the best items are PvE items thus making them less available to PvPers<br />
<br />
The only realistic solution is to standardize the gear you use within the arenas. Once they do that you have basically factored gear out of the question and all that is left is your team makeup and skill. This will of course, annoy a lot of people, many with good gear will be very upset to find their skill level suddenly decreased by a level playing field and of course some will be upset that they don't get to choose the exact gear they want. It does however have the big advantage that blizzard can introduce meaningful costs on arena rewards. Right now the system of arena rewards is broken because of two conflicting requirements. The gear should be hard to get since it is the reward and the gear should be easy to get because you can't compete without it. If they normalize the gear inside the arenas then the second of these requirements goes away. They can make it as hard as they want to get the arena reward gear, but the reward is to be able to use that gear outside the arenas. So when you see someone walking around in full S3 gear you will know they are a skilled arena player. It also fixes the problem of the uneven gearing speeds between PvP and PvE. Blizzard have to be aware that a lot of their players are very frustrated at the different way they hand out gear at present (players on both sides are unhappy) and a system that offers fairer arenas, more meaningful rewards to pvpers and more balanced rewards between pvp and pve would have to be good all round.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I see one final barrier to eSports acceptance for WoW that they can't really overcome. Trying to make an eSport out of a game with a monthly subscription will always be a fail. Many companies will be reluctant to host an event where the players need to be paying another (possibly competing) firm $180 a year in fees just to compete and I would guess they could fall afoul of gambling restrictions since if you have to pay to compete it is basically a form of gambling.<br />
<br />
The one thing I hope it doesn't mean though is a big round of nerfs and buffs to the classes for arena balance. I think a lot of PvE players are tired of seeing their class constantly tweaked and changed to balance around arena issues and at some point they need to be willing to make abilities just work differently in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's how it's working in Ragnarok Online and maybe other MMOs. During PvP magical damages are strongly nerfed because they deal too much damage, and an item which totally prevent spell pushback is disabled, for example. I think this trully is the solution and Blizzard should investigate this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well it may not be very constructive, but I do agree entirely with this point. I cannot see how Blizzard can make arenas competitive and, at the same time, with progressive rewards, if they do not remove outside gear and arena rewards from the arena gameplay. Additionally, the collision of a low gear difference that e-sports require with a long ladder that PVE wishes is breaking the game.</div></div><hr />

You're fucking retarded. Did you just hit 70 and find out you can't do well in arenas right away like BG's?<br />
<br />
If you'd EVER played arena at a decent level, you'd know that EVERYONE ALREADY HAS THE GEAR once you pass about 1800-1900. Hell, people in the 1500's had full merc LAST season.<br />
<br />
New players aren't good at arena, period. You don't automatically get gladiator cause you have all glad gear. Your &quot;issue&quot; is nonexistent. Every single gladiator team last season had full season 2 after about a month, and they're getting close this season too.<br />
<br />
EVEN if you're new, just get welfare epics. Have you actually LOOKED at the gear? S1 is like... 5-10 stam worse than season THREE gear. Your stats will be MARGINALLY worse than a gladiator if you grind all the honor gear you can. Gear is NOT an issue except for scrubs who just hit 70 and don't deserve to have the gear anyway.</div></div><hr />

His point was that with Season 1, it was easy for everyone to break into Arena and, with each subsequent season, new Arena entrants will find it incrementally more difficult to break in.<br />
<br />
His points were valid and well constructed and, seeing as you've resorted to personal attacks, it's obvious you have no substantial rebuttal in defense of the horridly broken Arena system.<br />

Ok, so it's more difficult to play at a high level of arena than it was season 1. So what? What's &quot;difficult&quot; about grinding honor? Go do 100 AVs, buy gear, play arenas. Simple.<br />
<br />
Certainly it takes a while to grind out a full set, but THE GEAR IS THERE. It's not like raiding where when you hit 70 you have to work your way up with Kara, Gruuls, SSC/TK, etc before you're acceptable in a BT/Hyjal raid. You can do AV at freaking 61, or even 51 (though that would take a lot longer), and save up all the honor you need to have a full set of Gladiator/Vindicator's gear. IT'S NOT HARD.<br />
<br />
Season 2 it was HARDER, I'd argue, cause your best set pieces and weapon from PVP were High Warlords. Now you have gladiator, which is a minor downgrade from S2, which is a minor downgrade from S3. Heck, there weren't even any RESIL changes in the new season, so your resil is just the same as a fully decked out S3 player. You're just a little weaker cause of the weapon and 5 set pieces in terms of damage/healing/weapon DPS/stam. BUT NOT ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL.<br />
<br />
If you have the &quot;skill&quot; and class makeup to do well in arenas, you WILL BE FINE with S1 gear. Maybe you can't make it to Merciless Gladiator, but you sure as hell can get high rated enough that you'll start getting S3 gear once every week or two. If you lack the motivation to do BGs, or devote yourself to playing well, or using a good combination, then why should blizzard cater to your lazy ass by giving you an equal playing field with people who ARE willing to grind out honor or practice good combinations???<br />
<br />
Maybe *you* should look beyond my first sentence, &quot;brush up on your reading comprehension skills&quot; and all that. I give plenty of reasons why his post was a bad idea, and more in this one. Just cause I called him stupid doesn't mean what I'm saying isn't right. Lighten up, it's the internet, every other word is &quot;retard&quot; or &quot;stupid.&quot; I could argue that YOU are belittling/personally attacking me by insulting my reading skills, or calling me &quot;bub.&quot;<br />
<br />
And you CERTAINLY haven't provided any evidence as to why the arena system is &quot;horribly broken&quot; as you so put it, unlike how I have for the counter point. Just cause you SAY it's broken doesn't make it broken. The arena system is perfect, and it's obvious you have no substantial rebuttal to this idea. See, I can make shit up too and act like it's fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point about the arena being broken has more to do with the exploits that exist per class. If you pvp at all you would understand that each proposed strength of each class is nothing more than an exploit of a game mechanic, he who exploits early and often wins. <br />

The gearing speeds are all pavlovian. Pvp players would never pvp if it took them just as long as pve players to get gear. pvp is a short burst of high attention activity pve is a more gradual,longer in terms of set up/prep experience , and the battles provide nice action but if you fail it takes a while to get re-setup. That is what pve'ers enjoy the prep/atmosphere/&quot;family-time&quot; that those encounters offer.<br />
<br />
Why do you think there is such a ruckus about AV? Point awarding, AFKers, strategy play, AV represents the best /worst blend of pvp and pve so it will always have the most mass appeal. <br />
<br />
What is not being acknowledge is that there is a growing number of pve'ers that want their gear sooner......This is your point of friction. On the opposite end there is a growing number of Pvp'ers that want more distance between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;veteran&quot; players. <br />
<br />
The only fix that has worked so far is during a tournament pre-made characters are used instead of personal characters. If you watch what happened at that last tournament (dream hack)the last two teams choose the classes with the most powerful exploits to win, not what they were used to playing at the beginning.<br />
Consequently its E-sports that has provided a viable fix to a problem deemed by many as unfixable. Why would Blizz not want to &quot;go with the flow&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azain</div><div class="date">2007-12-27, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His point was that with Season 1, it was easy for everyone to break into Arena and, with each subsequent season, new Arena entrants will find it incrementally more difficult to break in.<br />
<br />
His points were valid and well constructed and, seeing as you've resorted to personal attacks, it's obvious you have no substantial rebuttal in defense of the horridly broken Arena system.<br />
<br />
The point about the arena being broken has more to do with the exploits that exist per class. If you pvp at all you would understand that each proposed strength of each class is nothing more than an exploit of a game mechanic, he who exploits early and often wins. <br />

<br />
Blizz has and always will do their own thing :P<br />
<br />
and by exploits i think you mean abilities...are HoTs an exploit? is mana burn an exploit? the truth is if every class were balanced there would only be 1 class. yes pve'ers want gear in the same time frame as pvp'ers, and yes pvp'ers want more separation between top and bottom, will either of these happen? probably not. blizzard wants a 'reset' with each season, a fresh start where it only takes you 1 season to catch up and jump right into the mix. is this more fair to alts/rerolls/former pve'ers? sure, but at the same time it shows no loyalty outside of a netherdrake for the top .5% of legitimate teams. you could be in the duelist +50 club or whatever it is each season, yet you have the same gear as someone who has never broken 1600.<br />
<br />
also, your 2nd sentence starts with &quot;if you pvp at all&quot;...wouldn't you expect someone defending the arena system as perfect to be someone who cares and probably pvps? anyway, personal attacks aside...<br />
<br />
AV does not have the most appeal beause its a mix of strategy and pve vs pvp or whatever, it gives the most honor. if it was so appealing people wouldn't afk bot in it, they would actually play it. short of a premade in wsg/eots/ab on that particular BG's holiday weekend, AV will always offer the most honor, even in a pug. also i can show you many instances of people who have fun in BG's as friends, and many raid environments which could never be label'd as &quot;family time&quot;...<br />
<br />
lastly, as a warrior my strength is MS spam, high damage with a healing debuff, this is somehow an exploit of game mechanics? please do have fun explaining that one. he who exploits early and often wins sounds like pve to me...hey let's reset rag until his sons don't spawn or stealth up the hill so the birds don't spawn (ZA) or huhuran isn't bolting as much we can win. exploits also don't fall on the classes themselves put on the players, like the mod that tells you what spec and what gear classes are using in arena, when it should be left as a surprise.</div></div><hr />
