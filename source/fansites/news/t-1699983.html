Patch 6.1 PTR - Trader NPCs<br />
Patch 6.1 adds some new trader NPCs that randomly spawn in your Town Hall. They have a daily quest that allows you to turn in ore, herbs, Raw Beast Hide (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/110609-raw-beast-hide), Draenic Dust (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/109693-draenic-dust), or Sumptuous Fur (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38293-sumptuous-fur) for Primal Spirit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/120945-primal-spirit) and other crafting reagents. These are mostly daily quests and are all flagged as Engineering quests in the database, but they are completable by everyone currently. <br />
<br />
These Traders also sell the new recipes added in Patch 6.1 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/recipes?filter-patch=19445), as well as Primal Spirit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/120945-primal-spirit), for 5 x Raw Material each (Hides, Fur, Ore, Herbs, and Dust). Keep in mind that this means the things Primal Spirit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/120945-primal-spirit#related:currency-for;_!) can be exchanged for will likely drop in price, including Savage Blood (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118472-savage-blood) and crafted gear. <br />

Patch 6.1 PTR - Reputation Mount Prices<br />
Forum readers may have seen that the latest PTR build significantly increased reputation mount prices (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1699065-6-1-PTR-Buy-your-rep-mounts-now). It turns out that this is a bug!<br />
For people that don't know the prices for the rep mounts are going up substantially from 5k to around 40k / 50k. I find this change very unreasonable and not needed. Hopefully this isn't intentional, but right now would be the best time to provide feedback on this change.<br />
The change to gold costs for certain mounts currently on the 6.1 PTR isn't intentional. The modified gold cost was part of a change that's still in currently progress to make the mounts/items vendor refundable for gold. Once those changes have been fully implemented, the gold costs should return back to its current levels on the live realms.<br />
<br />
TL;DR, there are currently no plans to change the cost of the mounts in question when patch 6.1 goes live.<br />

Patch 6.1 PTR - Slagworks (Raid Finder) Open This Weekend<br />
The Slagworks wing of Blackrock Foundry (Oregorger, Gruul, and the Blast Furnace encounter) is open over the weekend on the PTR. Please use this thread to discuss and provide feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Bots<br />
There's a lot of threads on this topic in here, but this one had the most entertaining premise, so this is where I'll say this.<br />
<br />
We wage a constant battle against bots. Blizzard has an entire department devoted to tracking down bots, hacks, and the like, and punishing those who make use of them. In fact, if/when you have something to report, you can email that team directly at hacks@blizzard.com. They'd absolutely love to hear from you.<br />
<br />
That goes for more than just bots, as well. Exploits, cheats, hacks -- any such behavior you see, send our Hacks team an email. Any evidence you can put together is great as well, video in particular. Toss something up on Youtube (can be unlisted) and send us the link. Make sure character names and realms are included. Getting in-game reports of bad behavior is good, but it's even better to have hard evidence of said behavior.<br />
<br />
We probably can't completely wipe bots from existence. We sure as hell try, but the fight continues. We can, however, punish as many of those who use them as we can catch. And the more we catch, the better our ability to detect them gets.<br />
<br />
And seriously, if you catch someone in the act, email hacks@blizzard.com.<br />
<br />
(Also, juuuuust to be clear, we did not &quot;create bots to speed up the BG queue process.&quot; That's silly.)<br />
<br />
People are told SS/videos are not enough proof.<br />
We won't outright ban someone out of the blue based on one screenshot. But typically, players that are using these sorts of obvious exploits have several reports against them as well. It's often difficult for us to catch those players in the act, so seeing visual evidence really helps. Videos also help us learn more about how a hack or exploit operates, so we can know what we're looking for in the future.<br />
<br />
In short, screenshots and videos aren't enough proof on their own, but they certainly help us pull the trigger.<br />
<br />
If an individual cheating or exploiting, and we record videos or take screenshots. They &quot;cannot be used as evidence&quot;. Many years ago (2 at least) I stumbled upon a thread with two blue posts backing up that screenshots and videos cannot be used as legitimate evidence since they can be easily be modified. <br />
<br />
Can you please; confirm or deny is this is still true in 2015? Regardless of PvE or PvP. I do understand calling out individuals on the forum is against the CoC/ToS however; if one were to properly follow through with a proper report, could said images and videos be used against the accused party? Or do we only give you guys our word and from there you do your investigation?<br />
I've only been at Blizzard just shy of 2 years, so I'm not sure what the policy was before I got here. I just know what it is now, which is what I said above.<br />
<br />
Calling out individuals publicly on the forums (aka &quot;naming and shaming&quot;) is against the ToS largely to protect innocent players from harassment. As you can imagine, there are a lot of false reports. We'd hate for someone to be subjected to harassment in-game because some troll is pretty good with Photoshop, for example. It also helps us fight back against the bots if the surly individuals who create them are less aware of the exact evidence we're given.<br />

I never answer this as it would only become a distraction to actual feedback. &quot;X is good/bad because you do/don't play it&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/556266298875731969))<br />

Hey what do you think about having dampening start at the beginning of a match in 2v2? It's one of my key annoying issues right now<br />
if both teams have a healer, it does start immediately. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/557330470577262592))<br />
<br />
I hope you don't consider Ashran a failure. For all its flaws (which can be fixed!), it's the best wPvP in WoW yet. Thank you.<br />
Thanks. We consider the queueing system a failure, which we intend on fixing.in 6.1. A lot of aggravation starts there. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/557295977476788224))<br />

My favourite 6.1 feature is either the new Blood Elf models, depending on how they turn out, or the Heirloom tab. <br />
<br />
I think Blizzard should work on integrating TeamSpeak next, to replace their voice chat feature. A Google Translate integration would also be great, for times when you end up in a group that doesn't speak English.</div></div><hr />

The only feature that would be nice if done correctly would be the voice chat. If it was stable and quality feature and could reliable replace teamspeak/ventrillo...</div></div><hr />

Or you need a quick photo for some dating site, go for it.<br />
<br />
Voice chat in this game for anything other than guild/invited runs is the worst idea in the history of the internet. Do I really want chat-roulette in WoW? I think a screwdriver to the head sounds more appealing. I remember when this thing came out in TBC, half the raid had echos in vent and it took a week to get everyone to turn it the hell off. I think they were using the same binds for both or something.<br />

more serious, id love for twitter and all the other pieces of shit to just get deleted from the internet. One of the main reasons people are starting to use bullshit words like bae and short versions of every damn thing. <br />
adding twitter support is just going to add more lines of code that can contain problems. And for what? is it so damn hard to buy a secondary screen and just use that for twitter,Facebook and all the rest? i hardly think so.<br />
<br />
Guess i am not really mad at that feature, more about the fact that they could have done something useful with the time, like add more variety to garrisons, enable warlocks to enslave demons and use them forever, add another slot to garrisons so you get 1 to pick from the gimmic department, drawen bunker and +5 follower seems rather mandatory for raiders. Change how the inscription herb destroying works (add a mode where you can crush an entire stack for example) ... so many cool things that they could have done, but no let's add a feature that is useless ...</div></div><hr />

There is so much crap in there I swear my screen started to smell. Twitter, selfies, ingame voice chat...and the ridiculous high prices(due to insane gating with blood) for crafted items will decrease when the foundry hits the live servers and all the crafted stuff will be useless anyway. All that is already a bad joke....but the bot thing? HILARIOUS!!!! Blizz has a devoted team to find botters? Really? I only need 10 minutes in AV to find 30 bots at night. A SINGLE devoted dev in every region that would jump onto those servers and permanently ban those bots every night would discourage bot users within weeks. If Blizz wants to do something against bots than fire that team(I doubt there is one), give me their money...and the number of bots will go down in NO TIME. The number of accounts will go down due to bans as well tho. You do not have to find all bots, you have to give players the feeling that they may actually get caught(fear is a really strong weapon, you know?). Pretending to go for perfection and using that as an excuse to do nothing(cause you can't reach perfection) is just cheap.<br />
<br />
Go send your videos to hack@blizzwhatever. That will change exactly as much as reporting the bots or writing a ticket or reporting them in the forum. Blizz is just inventing ever new ways to tell us how we can help them to do THEIR job(or to pretend to do their job while doing nothing at all cause even bot accounts generate money).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Blizzard should work on integrating TeamSpeak next, to replace their voice chat feature. A Google Translate integration would also be great, for times when you end up in a group that doesn't speak English.<br />

This is a pretty good idea, with the new group finder I do end up in more groups with non english typers.</div></div><hr />

What is even more funny is seeing people like you believing that one has to be 100% positive or nothing at all about everything. It's perfectly healthy voicing concerns and not being happy with everything, but if one still has fun whilst playing and see a reason to keep at it there's nothing &quot;sheepish&quot; about it. I'm fairly positive that people quit just fine the moment they themselves no longer feel that the game is worth it. &quot;Sheep&quot;... That term is fast becoming way too popular considering it doesn't even make sense half the times.</div></div><hr />

Badly worded polls -journalism's cheap shot at worst, a missed opportunity at best.<br />

I would LOVE for their to be a solid, reliable voice chat for the Guild in our subscription based MMO, and Blizzard should be ashamed of bolting on features while in game voice chat languishes in perpetual purgatory.<br />

more serious, id love for twitter and all the other pieces of shit to just get deleted from the internet. One of the main reasons people are starting to use bullshit words like bae and short versions of every damn thing. <br />
adding twitter support is just going to add more lines of code that can contain problems. And for what? is it so damn hard to buy a secondary screen and just use that for twitter,Facebook and all the rest? i hardly think so.<br />
<br />
Guess i am not really mad at that feature, more about the fact that they could have done something useful with the time, like add more variety to garrisons, enable warlocks to enslave demons and use them forever, add another slot to garrisons so you get 1 to pick from the gimmic department, drawen bunker and +5 follower seems rather mandatory for raiders. Change how the inscription herb destroying works (add a mode where you can crush an entire stack for example) ... so many cool things that they could have done, but no let's add a feature that is useless ...<br />
<br />
1984 sums it up perfectly. Dumb down the language so people become drooling idiots who have difficulty expressing themselves and having freedom of thought. Then the government can control you easier, twitter is the new newspeak.<br />

This site, besides being filled to the brim of a fedora with bronies is also filled with blizzard fanboys. A poll here is extremely biased.

Sort of makes the poll superfluous, which is the funny part.:D <br />

If MMOC users &quot;are definitely not representative of the game's overall population,&quot; and, &quot;likely not the target audience for Twitter integration,&quot; why even have the polls in the first place? Aren't you pretty much already conceding skewed results?</div></div><hr />

I don't tell people I play. So yes, it's fucking embarrassing and they don't do much to rectify that, they just make it worse.</div></div><hr />

It's difficult to 95%+ an online poll just because there will be those random folks who vote the non-true option just because they can [not to say there aren't people who don't use it, but yea, figure seems higher than what it probably is]</div></div><hr />

Or people were confused and think mumble/teamspeak/vent are what the poll is about.</div></div><hr />

We are consuming wow content quicker than ever and yet apart from a gated raid about to launch in nearly 3 months we have had nothing but quality of life changes and three useless features added! Black Rock raid and a few profession changes is not enough to justify another three to four months of no more content...surely dev time could have been spent on something better?<br />
<br />
Seriously? If raids were released every 3-4 months consistently... you'd have nothing (legitimate) to complain about on content release. Whine about other junk if you must, but thats plenty fast for the raiding community--as evidenced by HC/mythic progress.</div></div><hr />

That's probably it, good catch</div></div><hr />
