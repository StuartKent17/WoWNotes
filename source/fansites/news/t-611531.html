<br />
<br />
Glyph of Mind Flay 01 (Priest) (Class: Priest) - Increases the range of your Mind Flay spell by 5 yards but it no longer reduces the target's movement speed.<br />
Nice for raiders?<br />
<br />
Glyph of Spirit of Redemption 01 (Priest) (Class: Priest) - Critical heals cast while Spirit of Redemption is active increase the remaining duration of Spirit of Redemption by 4 sec.<br />
I hope there is a cooldown on this...<br />
<br />
Glyph of Dispel Magic 01 (Priest) (Class: Priest) - Your Dispel Magic also heals your target for 3% of maximum health if it removes a damaging effect.<br />
w00t, another reason to spec disc!<br />
<br />
Glyph of Flash Heal 01 (Priest) (Class: Priest) - Your Flash Heal has a 50% chance to reduce the cast time of your next Greater Heal by 0.3 sec<br />
Isn't there anything else that does this too, aka stack?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, everything is nice :D Am gonna switch to Inscription on some char...</div></div><hr />

I like it also but still it would be nice it they would make up their mind on keeping full health and mana on transform or not. I just hope they keep it, demon form is kinda meant for a &quot;oh crap, im gonna die&quot; button, at least thats what I think it should be. I mean with a 5 min CD thats what it seems like.

No, you idiot! Shield wall is now on a 5 minute CD. So therefore with 2/2 in it it would be on a 4 minute cooldown. Also the damage reduction is down from 75% to 50% for 12sec.</div></div><hr />

88 dps on a caster weapon seems about right. The other mace should be 140-145 dps, I guess. They just put the same dps on both weapon by mistake. Let's hope so anyway... :-X</div></div><hr />

Potion Sickness seems to have been removed. http://s6.photobucket.com/albums/y226/symphonia32/?action=view&amp;current=WoWScrnShot_080908_154737.jpg<br />
<br />
According to World of Raids (I don't know cause I'm not in the beta) potion sickness just doesn't show anymore... but if you try to use a second potion you won't be able to.</div></div><hr />

I find it odd too... If I had to guess though, I'd assume it was bonus 56 to the critical rating and they got a little confused implementing it.</div></div><hr />
