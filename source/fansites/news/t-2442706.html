Because the way the raid is set up, the last 3 bosses for us is the 4th 5th and 6th boss that the horde fight and vice versa, basicly a sort of flashback.</div></div><hr />

Yes?<br />
By nerfing a spec you are literally &quot;technicly&quot; buffing all the rest, because then with that you can focus on making mechanics done by all those.<br />
<br />
it is literally<br />

This was addressed a long time ago, but both factions will fight all bosses, including 3 that are members of their faction. The bosses that don't make sense will be fought in the manner of a flashback, with an NPC telling you what the opposing faction did while you were away.<br />
Think of it like the CoT disguises</div></div><hr />

The last 3 bosses of the raid for the Alliance are a recap of what the Horde has done, so you'll probably get a debuff &quot;Portraing a Horde Hero&quot;. Think of something along the lines of what happened in CoT instances when you're a non-human.</div></div><hr />

Well, they did nerf us to the ground from PvP though. So their hate is real at least.<br />
<br />
(aka: don't expect anything but nerfs, they are clueless. Proof just now in these notes: Destro nerf right there when the only powerfull spec is Affli)</div></div><hr />

The Horde are not being &quot;stomped&quot; by the Alliance - the Alliance are not even fighting the Horde - they're fighting Zandalari Trolls and their minnions. They blow up Zandalari ships, kill Zandalari Trolls and their creatures, fight and possibly kill Rhastakan, and then the actual Horde shows up under Nathanos' lead and kicks the Alliance's ass back to sea, nearly killing 2 of it's faction leaders in the process (Mekkatorque is as good as dead as he's frozen and can't be unfrozen by any known means, and Jaiana is &quot;nearly&quot; dead). The Horde wins this battle - just as they did in Ashenvale, Darkshore, Teldrasil and Undercity. This will make the 5th loss in a row for the Alliance - and that isn't counting whatever the cannon ending of Arathi is (considering the current way things are going - I'm sure Horde will win that too).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for literally proving yourself wrong<br />
if you have a rating system 1-10<br />
and 3= prot warrior, dk is 10, and rest are 5.<br />
3/10 is shit right?<br />
now if dk is dropped to 5, it is suddenly a 5 chart, there is no 10<br />
so suddenly prot warrior is 3/5 and a 3/5 movie is pretty good for example<br />

No you don't....a 30% is still a 30% if it's on a scale of 1-10 or 1-5....unless they nerf all tanks to equally suck Warrior is still going to be the worst tank.<br />
<br />
Making Blood suck a little more doesn't make Prot Warrior suck any less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok so here is how it works...<br />
If the game has a spec that is double the strength of other specs, the devs will balance the game around it<br />
I literally cannot dumb this down any more for you.<br />
Yes warrior will still be the worst tank, but by far less.<br />
there will always be a worst spec welcome to how the world fucking works<br />
THERE WILL NEVER BE EQUALITY<br />
there will ALWAYS BE &quot;This tank is 1% better then the others, and that one is 1% worse&quot;<br />
welcome to the reality, so the best we can do is line them up better</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the game is balanced then why do Prot Warriors suck in the first place? By your logic they shouldn't because the game is balanced around them....or can it be the devs suck at balance? That nerfing one spec wont make another spec better?<br />
<br />

<br />
You are just a lost cause...<br />
<br />
if the best spec does 100k dps<br />
and the boss has 1 mil hp<br />
and you do 30k<br />
<br />
then the best spec drops to 50k <br />
so the boss to compensate drops down to 500k as they no longer need to balance around raids having nothing but them<br />
you do 30k.<br />
<br />
Now before you did 3% of the bosses health as dps<br />
You now do 6% dps even though you were not touched<br />
simply the top end was broguht down which allowed for the boss to also be brought down</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats because it is a mechanic not a number<br />
if you want other tanks to be brought you need to remove abilities from brewmasters<br />
same reason why people bring locks, and mages, and shamans.<br />
&quot;Why do all raids bring 1 warlock garunteed wtf nerf please&quot;<br />
ok better remove gateway and healthstone...<br />
<br />
Brewmaster is not being brought cause its survivability is godly, its being brought because *gasp* ON VERY SPECIFIC BOSSES, SOME VERY SPECIFIC SPECS SHINE!<br />

yeah but the fact that she stayed behind and heroically fights the murder hobos and almost getting killed but getting the victory makes me respect her far a lot more.<br />
<br />
i would say that is going to be pretty epic to fight her with all those frost spells including the flying dutchman. it is a honor to fight a raid boss that actually wins.<br />
and also, as a last boss.<br />
if she was killed and the horde take her head or turn her into a banshee or something like that, i would say that would be devastating for the alliance. <br />
im glad that she wins, getting wounded is nothing compared to what could have happened to her.</div></div><hr />

Yes because of its mechanics, if you want it to be equal you will need to either remove spells from brewmaster, or nerf it until its literally useless. their mobility is insane compared to others and stagger<br />

Warrior and dh has plenty of mobility too and they aren't getting spots thanks to that over more immobile tanks like dk / pala. <br />
<br />
<br />
Brewmaster is best right now because of its mechanics, not because of its survivability Brewmaster has crazy survivability as long as healers are still healing, it's the least likely tank to die in 3 seconds out of all tank classes. On top of it it's the most forgiving tank to play. It's exactly the reason they're taken to fetid or mythrax over other tanks that can get gibbed much more easily. <br />
<br />
Tbh if you read any pro brewmaster feedback most of them aren't even happy about being a stagger bot with no difference between good and average player. &quot;Not interesting and too passive&quot; is often the depiction of the modern day brewmaster. Warrior has to juggle multiple cooldowns, monk just stands there and drinks ironskin brew, and in the end, dies less often. <br />

No its not, also again, because people are playing the &quot;lol ele sucks&quot; people arnt playing it, which puts it low on the charts cause none of the best players are playing it.<br />
<br />
as literally said by blizzard.<br />
a 1% difference can quickly change to a 10%<br />
the 1% difference can make the best of the best move over to a different spec, which means the top are no longer in the spec, making it look weaker</div></div><hr />

They blow up Zandalari ships, kill Zandalari Trolls and their creatures, fight and possibly kill Rhastakan, and then the actual Horde shows up under Nathanos' lead and kicks the Alliance's ass back to sea, nearly killing 2 of it's faction leaders in the process (Mekkatorque is as good as dead as he's frozen and can't be unfrozen by any known means, and Jaiana is &quot;nearly&quot; dead). The Horde wins this battle - just as they did in Ashenvale, Darkshore, Teldrasil and Undercity. This will make the 5th loss in a row for the Alliance - and that isn't counting whatever the cannon ending of Arathi is (considering the current way things are going - I'm sure Horde will win that too).<br />
<br />
Wasting your breath. Horde players love to play the victim while theyre #WINNING over and over and over.<br />
<br />
The first raid of the expansion has literally zero Alliance story or purpose, and in the second raid, Alliance players get to 1) lose, then 2) fight their own leaders in a FLASHBACK where they're playing as Horde.<br />

Wow its great to be Alliance.</div></div><hr />
