Many PvP additions and updates are coming with Battle for Azeroth, including changes to PvP Talents, the introduction of War Mode, Bounties, and a new Dueler’s Guild. In this preview, we’ll give you a bit more information on what’s in store for each.<br />
<br />
Updated PvP Talent System<br />
With Battle for Azeroth, we’re making changes to how we’re handling talents in PvP. In Legion’s current Honor Talent system, talents become available as you earn Honor levels through participating in PvP, which puts players looking to get into PvP for the first time at a disadvantage until they earn the tools everyone else already has. In Battle for Azeroth, we’re streamlining the system so that PvP talents will become available as you level, keeping players on more even footing.<br />
<br />
In Legion, PvP talents were organized in rows of three, much like regular class talents; in Battle for Azeroth, players will be able to select any three PvP talents from a large pool of options, along with a special crowd-control-breaking talent (variations on the old “PvP trinket”).<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/wm01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/wm01.jpg) <br />
<br />
You’ll earn this crowd-control breaker at level 20, choosing from one of three available options via a fly-out menu. By level 110, all PvP talent options will be available to choose within the Talent pane (N). This system offers more options for customizing your character to suit your play style or your environment, whether that’s world PvP, Battlegrounds, Arenas, or the new Dueler’s Guild (more on that below). As with your class talents, you’ll need to be in a rested area to switch between these.<br />
<br />
War Mode—Are You In?<br />
We’re introducing a new way of getting into PvP out in the world with a system we’re calling War Mode. War Mode tears down boundaries and server rule-set distinctions, allowing players on any realm to decide when they want to jump into a world PvP experience full of like-minded players in the ongoing battle between Horde and Alliance.<br />
<br />
This new system gives us the opportunity to revisit World of Warcraft PvP as an open-world experience, building on the latest game technology available. Players can decide on the type of gameplay experience they want to have no matter their realm of choice. Whether that means opting out of world PvP entirely, gathering allies and venturing out into dangerous lands when the mood strikes you, or turning on War Mode and never looking back—the choice will be yours.<br />
<br />
With War Mode, we wanted to solve the problem of some players feeling “locked” into one play style or another by their realm choice. They might have picked a PvE realm purely because their friends were there, even though they were interested in open world PvP. Conversely, they could have chosen a PvP realm to start, but later decided it wasn’t for them anymore. War Mode provides a way for both styles of gameplay to co-exist for every player—and with the way realm sharding works now, we felt this was the right opportunity to let players choose.<br />
<br />
By toggling War Mode on, players will venture out into a world full of others who have made the same choice. This structure also provides a foundation upon which we can offer all-new systems to encourage and reward world PvP, open to all interested players regardless of their choice of realm.<br />
<br />
Players who choose to turn on War Mode will get a few additional bonuses while in the mode. First, while War Mode is on, all PvP talents you’ve chosen will be available to use anywhere PvP can occur, providing a more consistent and efficient experience as you level. Rather than having your PvP talents toggle on and off depending on your location in the world or whether you’re engaged with a creature or another player, you’ll have access to them everywhere PvP can happen. Sanctuary areas will still be PvP free.<br />
<br />
Players in War Mode will also get an additional bonus to experience gains while leveling up. We understand that when players choose to engage in PvP, the added danger from other players can result in a slight loss in leveling efficiency. We wanted to provide a way to balance this out without creating a situation in which players who choose not to engage in War Mode feel they’re losing out on an opportunity. For the same reason, at max level, War Mode also offers an additional bonus to gold, Resources, and Artifact Power earned from World Quests.<br />
<br />
War Mode can be toggled on or off beginning at level 20 by visiting either Orgrimmar or Stormwind and setting their preference in the Talent pane (N). Beware! Once you venture out in War Mode, all zones will become contested, including zones such as Northshire Abbey. Additional War Mode features such as Bounty Hunter and Air Drops (more on those below!) will only be available in the new zones in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
There are a few additional caveats when looking at grouping while in War Mode. If you’re taking part in dungeons or raids while you have it turned on, you will still be able to be summoned by players who do not have it on. Once summoned, you won’t be able to see each other until you have zoned into the instance. When using the Premade Group Finder to search for groups for outdoor activities such as questing or world bosses, you will only see groups containing players who also have War Mode on, unless you return to Orgrimmar or Stormwind to change your status.<br />
<br />
War Mode has a couple of additional features to make things even more interesting:<br />
<br />
Bounty Hunter System<br />
Infamy has its ups—and its downs. You can become infamous in War Mode by killing a certain number of players of the opposite faction without dying. Once you do, you’ll achieve the status of Assassin and gain an increase to your damage and healing by 15%. Congratulations!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/wm02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/wm02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Of course, there’s a downside to your newfound infamy. The more players an Assassin kills, the more likely they will show up on the zone map for other players to target and kill to gain a bounty. Players who successfully kill an Assassin of the opposite faction will receive Conquest points as well as other rewards. There can be three (or potentially more) Assassins on any Battle for Azeroth zone map at a time, providing plenty of opportunity for players—or groups of players—to take their revenge on the opposite faction’s Assassins.<br />
<br />
Air Drops<br />
From time to time, a flying machine will make its way across the sky. The rumble of its engine is a clear indicator that something is afoot. You’ll want to keep an eagle eye on the sky and watch for a War Supply Crate to drop somewhere in the zone. Similar to the chest in Gurubashi Arena, players can fight over the crate and claim it for their faction. Once a faction has gained control of the crate, anyone of that faction who is within the area will have a short period to open it and collect a piece of personal loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/wm03.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/wm03.jpg) <br />
<br />
You Could Be a Contender: Battle in the Dueler’s Guild<br />
Take your duels into the new outdoor arenas in either Boralus or Zuldazar. Similar to the Brawler’s Guild, players can speak with an NPC who will queue them to take part in 1-on-1 duels in the arena. Once in the arena, you’ll battle it out against a rival player to see who continues on. If you lose, you’re out. How far can you go before you’re no longer the top of the heap? Getting far enough through the gauntlet of players will provide some achievements, including Master of Duels, which rewards the title Contender.<br />
<br />
You’ll also find the PvP reward chest in the Dueler’s Guild if you’ve filled up your Conquest bar for the week. Read more about it in our Rated PvP Updates post.<br />
<br />
Honor Level Changes<br />
Legion’s Honor system was originally crafted around the idea of earning PvP talents through participation, and then resetting progress to gain Prestige—and cosmetic awards—in the process. Now that PvP talents are instead earned in the regular course of leveling, we’re refocusing the Honor system around open-ended progression that offers various cosmetic rewards for engaging in PvP.<br />
<br />
By participating in any type of PvP, you will gain Honor and eventually Honor Levels. As your Honor Level increases, you will earn rewards like titles, pets, mounts, and more. As your Honor Level rises, you will also progress through a series of icons associated with your character frame and displayed prominently on Battleground scoreboards, showing off your accomplishments for all to see. In Battle for Azeroth, Honor and the rewards earned through your participation are all account-wide. All Honor earned by individual characters in Legion will be aggregated into a single account-wide total Honor Level in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
For those who have already earned any of these rewards in Legion, you will retain them regardless of whether you meet any new Honor requirements.<br />
<br />
Whether you’re a grizzled PvP veteran or interested in trying your hand at world PvP for the first time, the Horde and the Alliance will have plenty of opportunity to prove their prowess in Battle for Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard been moving from the old PvE and defeat the bosses to lets do overwatch for world of warcraft....<br />
<br />
Can't people see...truly this glaring snakesales attitude? Lets put more into PvP and then we do not have to develop as much PvE, we throw in some new arena or <br />
some new PvP zone and let the players beat eachother that way we do not have to develop as many new PvE stuff, this is what it will end up being.<br />
<br />
Put more umph into PvP and more interest, and guess what, once you get use to PvP they will add more and more required stuff into PvP, and before you know it<br />
you have to do PvP quests just to get ahead in the PvE and then a few expansions down the road, why even build bosses, lets just build areas for PvP and yay<br />
we can cut down on the developers and their salaries...<br />
<br />
It would not be the first game that went from PvE and good storyline and slowly over time it became more action and more shooter and pvp oritend until<br />
in the end its nothing like what it presented itself to be.<br />
<br />
Look at for example Final Fantasy... anyone that played the first 3 can actually say they like the newest action-rpg SE released? <br />
<br />
I hope World of Warcraft remains PvE oriented and those wanting PvP go over to overwatch or get a stand alone game and stop mixing PvP and PvE<br />
and stop pandering to the PvP players.</div></div><hr />

pvp has had nothing new for basically the entirety of the game besides new bg's and arenas. This is the first time that world pvp will be incentive based. Nearly everything else in the game has been pve oriented. I really don't see the argument about how it's &quot;nothing new&quot; when this is literally one of the first times they've gotten anything at all.</div></div><hr />

This does have some pretty nice benefits for PVE also. Claiming the game is moving away from PVE is pure nonsense also.</div></div><hr />

read the entire post, it moves slowly and I fear the future will move away from pve to pvp <br />
and sooner or later it will be a faction against faction game<br />

Oh... by the way, in the class hall quest chain, there is a PvP requirement, to win a PvP game. <br />
Thats not moving away from PvE towards PvP, what comes next? <br />
Kill 500 players to get to next rank in your class?</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE players get to continue wandering around the world with a 100% damage/convenience focused builds not having a care in the world besides completing quests. The XP bonus and PvP talents are simply there to offset the slower pace of leveling while PvP is turned on (getting ganked, having to pull less mobs since another player could attack at any time, etc.) The only time that War Mode is going to be a net bonus is in the first several days of BFA when the other faction won't even be around yet. Most PvE players I know will be turning it on for the first week or so and then turning it off after since once the PvP starts it will be slower (even with the bonuses) to level on War Mode than on the PvE shard.</div></div><hr />

You best shut up about panties... <br />
<br />
PVP has always gotten new stuff every single expansion PVP has evoled.<br />
Has PVE evoled? its STILL same shit.... kill trash, kill boss, loot. There nothing new in that.<br />
Pretty scenery does not make anything new.<br />
Or has that not gone through your witless brain?<br />
<br />
PvP has evolved greatly but PvE has stagnated since the BC basically<br />
Its still same thing, nothing new at all...</div></div><hr />

Can never be killed or harassed by players of the opposite faction. Seriously, you do not see this as a benefit?<br />
<br />
Why would Non-Warmode players get increased rewards for playing in a low-risk overworld mode? It throws the risk vs. reward balance out the window.</div></div><hr />

No, because what you want is to get the developers stop making content for the people that enjoy PvP, so you can have more of what you enjoy. That has nothing to do about silencing an opinion, because your opinion is very entitled and selfish and is objectively stupid... More of one thing doesn't rule out the other.</div></div><hr />

what does everyone of those have in common? Challenge mode, Mythic Raids, Raids, Dungerons<br />
1. clear trash<br />
2. kill boss<br />
3. loot<br />
<br />
does a new UI change that???<br />
<br />
How about PvP<br />
you got now conquest PVP, where in reality you do not HAVE to PVP in order to win, just own an area of the map<br />
or... gather resources and win... another way of earning pvp<br />
or kill opposing member<br />
<br />
thats now 3 different ways in how PvP has evolved from the original kill em all and let god sort em out.<br />
<br />
Can you , honestly, say that PvE has changed in equally evolving manner?<br />

Yeah, cause there is only &quot;non mmo game&quot; (overwatch) who can bring &quot;PvP like style of a game&quot; /sarcasm.<br />
MMO are built uppon PvP with PvE serving the sole purpose of PvP, in case you missed the story of the genre in your life.<br />
A good MMO is doing both at the same level. Any player claiming the want only PvE or only PvP is NOT a pure MMO player. Unfortunately, there is so much nowadays.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. The PvP version of the Island Expeditions are a great step in this direction. I always thought purely PvE or PvP just felt so... contrived. PvE being scripted and often predictable vs. PvP, especially in arena-like settings feeling so sterile and meta defined. PvEvP really pulls from the best elements of both systems.</div></div><hr />

Bonus everything for the PVPer and those not PVP get squat.... nothing new... Blizzard been moving from the old PvE and defeat the bosses to lets do overwatch for world of warcraft....<br />
<br />
Can't people see...truly this glaring snakesales attitude? Lets put more into PvP and then we do not have to develop as much PvE, we throw in some new arena or <br />
some new PvP zone and let the players beat eachother that way we do not have to develop as many new PvE stuff, this is what it will end up being.<br />
<br />
Put more umph into PvP and more interest, and guess what, once you get use to PvP they will add more and more required stuff into PvP, and before you know it<br />
you have to do PvP quests just to get ahead in the PvE and then a few expansions down the road, why even build bosses, lets just build areas for PvP and yay<br />
we can cut down on the developers and their salaries...<br />
<br />
It would not be the first game that went from PvE and good storyline and slowly over time it became more action and more shooter and pvp oritend until<br />
in the end its nothing like what it presented itself to be.<br />
<br />
Look at for example Final Fantasy... anyone that played the first 3 can actually say they like the newest action-rpg SE released? <br />
<br />
I hope World of Warcraft remains PvE oriented and those wanting PvP go over to overwatch or get a stand alone game and stop mixing PvP and PvE<br />
and stop pandering to the PvP players.<br />
<br />
Even though I'm primarily a PVE player, I think the changes they are bringing to PVP are great for the game. <br />
<br />
Also, and this may come as a surprise to you, a lot of PVE players like me swap to PVP content when they get bored of PVE ... which keeps us in the game, and the player population healthy. Try not to view the world through such a narrow minded black and white lense. PVP has been part of WoW since Vanilla, even if it has gone through different iterations over the years.</div></div><hr />

If there was some kind of equal bonus for PVE THEN IT WOULDN'T BE A BONUS DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WORDS MEAN<br />

Do you know how little PVP development there is? Every two years is a HUGE PVE expansion pack, and MAYBE you get an arena (smaller than a dungeon!) or battleground (tiny zone).<br />

Do not blaspheme...<br />
There is a reason to my madness.<br />
Or have you not noticed recent years that Blizzard has gone more and more into PvP oriented territory?<br />
Have they released anything more than a half attempt to any other direction?<br />
Starcraft II gotten any love more than the missions half measured?<br />
Diablo III gotten any love at all?<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way, what HAS Blizzard released?<br />
Overwatch (pvp)<br />
Heroes (moba also pvp)<br />
they added activision games, shooter games, pvp<br />
<br />
I am a HUGE rpg fan and I played these games every since Blizzard was synapse and before that<br />
and I see a company thats gone away from their standards and it is worrying.<br />
<br />
The injection of PvP into WoW was before a totally different game than the PvE part, that is how I would like <br />
it to remain, keep the two separate, completely, do not force the PvE gamer to go PvP because he can't keep<br />
up with the PvP player. <br />
<br />
Personally, I hate PvP with one exception, strategic, planned, games like MOBA's but other than that I notice that<br />
those PvP usually tend to corpse camp, they tend to behave in a manner not befitting. So. I rather those things be<br />
as far away from me as possible.<br />
<br />
and I would LOVE if the developers actually took time to TRY and evolve PvE to something more than<br />
1. go there<br />
2. kill that bunch<br />
3. get their loot<br />
<br />
oh there are ofc variations, go there, kill that dude, go over to that dude get his hammer, go over to that dude and buy some water from him<br />
etc, but in the end it is a fetch this, kill that kind of game, no requirement of thinking or planning or doing anything else than eternally <br />
go to this place, kill X amount of critters.<br />
<br />
There was WAS attempts... where you would gather things, do quests, figure out clues etc and you got rewarded with <br />
open new areas, open new quests etc, but where are those now? sporadic &quot;games&quot; inside the wow like in argus where you click 2 statues<br />
and you use combinations to open chests. why not evolve that kind of thinking...?<br />
<br />
am I so damn wrong in wanting PvE to evolve equally as fast as PvP has? I see grand arenas, conquest islands, ladder matches, ranks, mounts, special prices etc for the PvP. <br />
<br />
And because I object and think that the developers are heading in a wrong direction (as I see it from my point of view)<br />
I am told to shut up and stop being egoistic. Fine, let Blizzard dumb it down to where facerolling is the key or do whatever.<br />
But WoW is losing its core values, and it stops at some point being WoW, it becomes WoPvP<br />
<br />
Now I will remain silent and let all the PVP nuts go flame over whatever while I get a BJ<br />

Literally the same argument homophobes make when they see gay people kiss in a movie. &quot;STOP PUSHING THE PVP AGENDA!&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire rest of the game is PVE rewards. The xpac is faction war focused. What in the everloving hell did you expect?<br />
<br />
Why the hell can't the game be both? Is there a law somewhere that forbids MMO-RPG's from having engaging pve AND pvp environments?<br />

That sounds like a L2P issue right there. There has been dozens of times that groups have tried to camp me. It even happened today. I was pretty bad today, died twice. DIED TWICE.

There is no need to remove them.The PvE bonuses are so tiny increase which i don't find noticeable at all.I'm a PvE player to the core.I never liked the PvP servers and never joined open world PvP cross realm.I don't think the PvE player base will be &quot;forced&quot; as you say into PvP.If you never liked PvP you won't start playing it now.</div></div><hr />

Ever tried going to any zone where world pvp happens (e.g. Timeless Isle) and see what kind of advantage a mythic raider has there? If you're fully decked in mythic gear you're going to absolutely destroy every single dedicated pvp'er who only does pvp, because in open world pve gear is king. So tell me more how it's only pve players that are forced to pvp.</div></div><hr />

Agreed 100%, and there's even one that complains about EVERYTHING new they implemented to pvp, like, everything. i'll just play my game and laugh at the crying little babies in the forums, they will complain, and when blizzard change things for the new expansion they will say how good this was, i've seen people say they will miss the relics for your artifact weapons and just having one weapon will be boring hahahahaha.</div></div><hr />

If you PvE the bonuses should apply to PvE and if you PvP those bonuses should be PvP only. It's mixing the two like this that really messes up the very delicate balance of things. Of course people are going to feel *forced* to enable it to get the **PVE** bonuses. It's just ridiculous. If PvP wasn't so horribly bad in this game then it wouldn't be a huge deal.<br />
<br />
Simple fact: If you feel forced to do content you don't like for rewards you can get doing content you like, you are mentally weak. Noone is forcing you to do anything but yourself.<br />

I think its fine. Do you really get off one one shotting lower levels? Everyone should have a fighting chance and now they do. Quit crying just because you can't go troll low level zones. I guess id cry too if the only PvP I was good at was ganking lowbies.</div></div><hr />

Then they should remove leveling completely. Homogenize everything like they have been doing for years now. Everyone gets 3 buttons, same stats, same gear same level. <br />

I dont think he was trying to make this point exactly. The scaling is so terrible in Beta, that overall i got the feeling, the more geared i get and level up the weaker i've got. Until 114 with starting gear 185 i could pull two packs and kill them with only 1/4 of my health gone. Now at lvl120 and 315iLvL hero dungeon gear i barely kill a non-elite boss and barely make it to survive with under 1/4 health, as a DPS and not a Prot pala(tank) for example, who tops the damage meters in every dungeon or a DH. ;)</div></div><hr />

The XP bonus and PvP talents are simply there to offset the slower pace of leveling while PvP is turned on (getting ganked, having to pull less mobs since another player could attack at any time, etc.) The only time that War Mode is going to be a net bonus is in the first several days of BFA when the other faction won't even be around yet. Most PvE players I know will be turning it on for the first week or so and then turning it off after since once the PvP starts it will be slower (even with the bonuses) to level on War Mode than on the PvE shard.<br />

You're making the same argument homophobes make about gay people. &quot;STOP THE PVP AGENDA&quot; Why can't the game be both? We've had 14 years of the game built literally around PVE. Now that they're adding real rewards and encouraging PVP you're crying? Maybe get good at pvp and stop crying. Or just never turn war mode on and don't worry about an aspect of the game you CLEARLY don't care about. <br />

I surely will not be turning this on. I prefer battlegrounds for pvp. And I want my abilities back which I had for such a long time in pve. PvP talents should be pvp only, that is, have only effect in pvp situations, not in pve ones. Modify abilities which already exist in pve, not giving new ones, or even worse, prune existing ones from pve to make them pvp exclusive.<br />

You must be a very sad, embittered and unhappy person if you genuinely think your PvE abilities have somehow been 'stolen' from you.<br />
<br />
And it's not a stupid concept. What you presumably mean to say is:<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a concept that I, personally, don't intend to take advantage of.&quot;<br />
<br />
And you know what? That's fine. World of Warcraft has become a very broad church, one that caters to several millions of players at different times, with different wants, and that house different aspirations.<br />

Bonus everything for the PVPer and those not PVP get squat.... nothing new... Blizzard been moving from the old PvE and defeat the bosses to lets do overwatch for world of warcraft....<br />
<br />
Can't people see...truly this glaring snakesales attitude? Lets put more into PvP and then we do not have to develop as much PvE, we throw in some new arena or <br />
some new PvP zone and let the players beat eachother that way we do not have to develop as many new PvE stuff, this is what it will end up being.<br />
<br />
Put more umph into PvP and more interest, and guess what, once you get use to PvP they will add more and more required stuff into PvP, and before you know it<br />
you have to do PvP quests just to get ahead in the PvE and then a few expansions down the road, why even build bosses, lets just build areas for PvP and yay<br />
we can cut down on the developers and their salaries...<br />
<br />
It would not be the first game that went from PvE and good storyline and slowly over time it became more action and more shooter and pvp oritend until<br />
in the end its nothing like what it presented itself to be.<br />
<br />
Look at for example Final Fantasy... anyone that played the first 3 can actually say they like the newest action-rpg SE released? <br />
<br />
I hope World of Warcraft remains PvE oriented and those wanting PvP go over to overwatch or get a stand alone game and stop mixing PvP and PvE<br />
and stop pandering to the PvP players.</div></div><hr />
