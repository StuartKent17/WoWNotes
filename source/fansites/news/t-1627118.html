Opening Ceremony<br />
<br />
Overwatch confirmed as new IP, playable at Blizzcon and &quot;sooner than you think. Team shooter set in the future on earth. 12 Heroes now, many more coming in the future.<br />
New Hearthstone expansion - Goblins and Gnomes, launching December 2014. It has 120 cards and spectator mode for friends.<br />
Heroes of the Storm closed beta begins January 13, 2015<br />
The spacegoat pet (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/spacegoatLiterallyASpacegoat.jpg?1) will be sold starting in December (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/348546-coming-soon-adopt-a-pet-for-charity/) to support the Red Cross's Ebola relief efforts.<br />

<br />
Warcraft Movie Presentation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4485-Warcraft-Movie-Presentation)<br />
<br />
People actually at Blizzcon saw a short teaser trailer, but the video won't be released online (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/530887786233348096).<br />
The movie will follow heroes on both factions, &quot;50% Alliance, 50% Horde&quot;.<br />
The visual effects are very realistic. Motion capture was used, the team worked with ILM to make it feel as much like live action as possible.<br />
Effects are Avatar and Lord of the Rings at the same time.<br />
Very detailed sets were built, such as part of Stormwind's main street.<br />
A partial list of the cast was released.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft - Items, Class Changes, and More (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4486-World-of-Warcraft-Items-Class-Changes-and-More)<br />

Overwatch Unveiled (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4481-Overwatch-Unveiled)<br />
<br />
Chris Metzen is only doing one voice in this game.<br />
The game will be accessible and have options other than putting a crosshair over someone.<br />
You should die less frequently than in current modern military shooters.<br />
Initially only on PC.<br />
No pricing model yet.<br />
<br />
Overwatch Press Kit (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4482-Overwatch-Press-Kit)<br />
<br />
Cinematic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0&amp;feature=player_embedded) and Gameplay (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dushZybUYnM&amp;feature=player_embedded) trailers released, along with videos of each hero's skills on the website (http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/).<br />
Lots of art and screenshots.<br />

<br />
Heroes of the Storm Overview (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1238-blizzcon-2014-heroes-panel-live-update)<br />
<br />
Draft mode is coming, with no duplicate heroes and no bans.<br />
Ranked play is coming with two leagues: Hero league (any size group queue) and Team league (fixed size teams only). There are seasons, points, and a separate skill rank. <br />
Leavers - If you leave games too often, you will only be matched with other people that leave games too often. You can undo this by not leaving games.<br />

This is most certainly not a WoW only website. it's called MMO champion and not WoW champion. unless the terms have changed, they will cover the most prominent MMO. If another MMO becomes more popular, MMO champion will cover that instead. <br />
<br />
Also, to say that starcraft suck is absolutly absurd. It doesn't suck or people wouldn't play it religiously. On top of that, you have comments asking about it so clearly you are wrong unless you feel your opinion speaks for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Typical fanboy defense. Pass the buck to the company not allowing people who PAID for a ticket to see the footage. It was Blizzard's call to allow the physical attendees to see it knowing full well their virtual CUSTOMERS would be screwed. If you have something that only half your customers can have even though they pay for it then the obvious choice is to just not let anyone have it.</div></div><hr />

QFT. I was watching a free stream and thought to myself...okay, 90% of the information they released was something which we already knew as far as Warcraft is concerned and the movie panel was a big cock tease for those who were streaming (take a drink every time they tell you to go upstairs and watch the video).<br />
<br />
Overwatch is a wash to me. When they first introduced it as a team-based, multiplayer FPS, I was hoping for something along the lines of Borderlands but instead we get Blizzard Fortress and that's just...okay...I guess...<br />
<br />
The D3 announcements are just meh too. I was expecting news about their next expansion since, if going by that chart from way back that seems to be quite accurate, there should be another one on the way.<br />
<br />
GamesCon, which had the opening cinematic to WoD, release date and the introduction to Lords of War, was a hell of a lot more exciting than this as far as Warcraft content is concerned. It lasted about a half-hour and was free to boot.</div></div><hr />

Plans for a pizza day for the 4th grade class are underway. They quickly realize they don't have the budget to feed the whole class. Only half will get pizza. What school would be dumb enough to go ahead with the pizza day? Most sane non assinine people would realize how unfair it is and call the whole thing off.</div></div><hr />

Whose utterance means beware any who expect the game to be more than a super casual/farmville crowd cash-in.<br />
Seems to be ripping off Team Fortress 2, but instead of rolling out new items for classes, going to go with LoL-milking strategy of popping out new heroes instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I love how people only have the capacity to blame the people that they only know about. They don't know much about Legendary so all they're able to do is blame Blizzard for something that is most likely not their fault.<br />

&quot;Effects are Avatar and Lord of the Rings at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this a joke?.<br />
<br />
Why would it be a joke? Are you going to say that the effects in those movies aren't good? Because that's absolutely ridiculous. The effects in both of those movies absolutely excelled in their times, above and beyond the tech at that time.</div></div><hr />

It's completely live action.<br />
<br />
Even the orcs are actual actors.<br />
<br />
CGI =/= not being live action.</div></div><hr />
