Now for the really fun question. No, I won't ask for tactics, cause I'm sure everyone else will :P But are there any additional mechanics in play when more than one watcher is engaged? Just yes or no, I don't want to spoil too much of it :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. I still don't get why people thought that in the first place. It really was about time that VoA was a bit spritzed up, at least for the very best guilds.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it'll still take quite a while to down this in 25-man, though, with the way more brutal gear requirements that it probably has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not talking from experience (obviously), but it seems just a matter of:<br />
4 tanks, 1 on each and 2 on Koralon. Each tank takes 1 of Emalon's constructs.<br />
<br />
Pull Emalon, bring him down to about 15%. Pull Koralon, bring him to 15%, Pull Archavon, bring him to 50%, heroism zerg is all down.<br />
If additional mechanics are added to the fight when all 3 come together than this would be a really interesting fight.<br />
<br />
PS. I know You'll ask why I don't have the achievement- simply we're not focusing on this, neither are we anywhere near as cutting edge as these guilds. I don' think any other top guilds were focusing on this, though I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't do that.<br />
<br />
- Archavon has an enrage timer<br />
- Emalon has adds that need to be nuked down fast<br />
<br />
Not sure about Koralon. But you'd have to have insane dps on the first two bosses to be able to split up into 3 groups. So I doubt they did it that way. Impressive feat none the less.</div></div><hr />

Koralon has a soft enrage so the longer the fight drags on the harder he hits and he hits EVERYONE. This is just amazing lol Grats to them! I though it was just a joke achievement.</div></div><hr />

We tried it yesterday and one Warlock failed a few seconds before Emalon Enrage on Koralon's fire so that Emalon becomes enrage (because his damage was missing, bad planning) , onehitted our tank and then Emalon died through DoTs :( But our DPS wouldn't be high enough yesterday :[</div></div><hr />

What? 8 min sated = they used bloodlust around 2 min ago. What are you telling us?<br />

I don't understand the &quot;clicker&quot; debate. What is he's using a Spellbinder-type addon, which allows to bind keys to skills, not buttons ?<br />

There's a trinket from 10man Yogg+0 that lets you summon them. I assume someone in that guild has it</div></div><hr />

When you do Yogg+0 on 10man, he drops a trinket every time that calls forth a tentacle. When you summon a tentacle there's 3 different ones that can be summoned, only 1 is chosen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First and foremost, huge gratz to Vanquish. I can't imagine this is easy to coordinate and pull off, so it probably took a lot of patience.<br />
<br />
Trying to move the raid with the boss to the other bosses would be difficult. When my guild was making attempts at this the first week (for kicks), we discovered that Koralon is very slow, but Archavon is very fast. I do not recall how fast Emalon was, but I suspect he was similar to Koralon. Perhaps the best strat would be to start with Emalon (longest hard enrage) and keeping the raid close enough to the adds to kill the charged add. Get to Koralon's room and have a hunter MD pull Archavon when Emalon is at 30% or so... takes Archavon 10-15 seconds to get to Koralon's room, so Emalon shold be low... burn Archavon to 10%, pull Koralon and pop BL. (For the record, Archavon does not leash.)<br />
<br />
That's at least how I would do it... I'm unfortunately not all that hardcore with my raiding.<br />
<br />
Now that EWF(10) is done, I would imagine some of the bleeding edge guilds will be taking a crack at figuring out EWF(25). More flexibility to bring more tanks and heals, but then your DPS has to be on its game.<br />
<br />
One more thing: they didn't bring a priest.</div></div><hr />

All 3 bosses were killed in Koralon's room.<br />
<br />
Emalon and Koralon were killed on top of each other so either one was moved there to get killed or both were tanked there to mitigate dmg from meteor fist. Odds are the pally tanked Emalon + his adds and a bear each had Koralon and Archavon.<br />

<br />
<br />
Emalon has a 6 minute enrage, and Archavon has a 5 minute enrage. Koralon's enrage is soft, but probably gets unhealable after 4 or 5 minutes or so (not to mention having the other 2 bosses there doing their abilities). So I can't imagine the fight going much longer than 7 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I think this is one of the more impressive pve achievements due to the crazy amount of ways it could be done, along with high difficulty. If someone gets 25 man that would be crazy, the healing must be intense O_O<br />
<br />
Its not as night and day as some people say, that clicking means you are terrible, and keybinding makes you a professional but there is no real denying that keybinding lends itself to a higher skillcap as you can do more at once and character movement is better.<br />
<br />
I am glad he pointed out he doesn't click, because if you want to succeed in pvp or pve (by that i mean cutting edge stuff) at the highest leve you really need to just bind your abilities, and a lot of times i see people justifying saying clicking is just as good, and everything else being equal its not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tactic would be :<br />
<br />
Get Archavon to 15% with all 10 Man. Pull him to Emalon. Separate them cause of AoE. Tank dmg on Archavon will get him to 10%. Down Archavon to 10% too.<br />
Get both to Koralon. Now it gets tricky. 1st pala tanks Emalon including Adds ( can be done with that gearlvl ) <br />
Bear + 2nd pala on Archavon+Koralon. Massive DPS on Koralon because it's timely restricted by Enrage. If all 3 are on equal health , it gets critical. Split up DPS : Enhance shamy and ret on Koralon+Archa and Rogue + Mage on Emalon and Hunter on Archavon. Then it comes down to proper switching and estimating damage.<br />
<br />
In rough this could work =)<br />
<br />
<br />
What about the enraged adds from emalon? someone kite it out of the room and let it explode far from the raid group?</div></div><hr />

Based on http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=33993 Enraged adds would deal 30,000 damage to everybody in a 50,000 yard. You can't range them, and i would be VERY AMAZED if everyone in the raid had more than 30k health and they just healed through it...<br />
But the fact that the highest dpser was only 5k, it could be possible they geared for extra stam to get everybody at that 32k+ health benchmark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not talking from experience (obviously), but it seems just a matter of:<br />
4 tanks, 1 on each and 2 on Koralon. Each tank takes 1 of Emalon's constructs.<br />
<br />
Pull Emalon, bring him down to about 15%. Pull Koralon, bring him to 15%, Pull Archavon, bring him to 50%, heroism zerg is all down.<br />
If additional mechanics are added to the fight when all 3 come together than this would be a really interesting fight.<br />
<br />
PS. I know You'll ask why I don't have the achievement- simply we're not focusing on this, neither are we anywhere near as cutting edge as these guilds. I don' think any other top guilds were focusing on this, though I could be wrong.<br />

<br />
From what I can see on the DPS chart it looks like they might have used 1 full time tank, 1 full time healer, 1prot pally healer, and a healing enhancement shaman.<br />
<br />
Full time tank probably held everything with the healing pally standing with him just spamming heals on him and the tank until just before Archavon charged and taunted. So the full time tank kept aggro on the other two.<br />
<br />
I am assuming an enhancement shaman healing since they can maelstrom chain heals while DPSing which is why their DPS is down around 2.7k</div></div><hr />

There's a tree and a shaman healing (Numbers 9 and 10 on Recount). The 1.8k dps pally is probably prot, the enh healing shammy makes sense (really don't know how much that kills an enh's dps, tbh), and it looks like the 3.2k druid is in bear form in the kill screenie. I don't know how much bear tanks normally do dps-wise, but maybe he kitty dps'd and jumped into bear for Koralon.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing the bear tanked the Emalon adds, 3.2k isn't that hard for a tank then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Koloran is last to be engaged, Emalon and Archavon ar both pulled to kolrans room.<br />
<br />
The strat the way i see it:<br />
<br />
A healer is with the tank that pulls archavon while kiting, More than likely the druid.<br />
<br />
A healer and both other tanks and the dps are with the emalon group. probably dotting up emalon while kiting him. Killing the enraged add each when he enrages at about the time you get to the center of the room.<br />
<br />
As archavon and emalon get to kolorans room, dps them both down to around 30% without engaging koloran just yet. Engage koloran and stack the 3 of them so that meteor fists is transfered to all three tanks, and dps the shit out of kolo and kill adds as they enrage and by the time you kill kolo AOES from dps rotations will have the other bosses sub-10% hp, kill them and you win.</div></div><hr />

They had 2 healers and 1 prot pally. Looks like also 1 feral druid that dpsed at first and then ended up switching to tanking.<br />
<br />
Highest dps was 5k.<br />
<br />
timer is 6 mins 15 seconds so they were defintely pushing the enrage probablly hit it as some died.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also looks like there was a shaman that was dpsing at first then switched to healing. Same line as the druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nterestingly enough there is a tactic I've heard, but yet to find proven.<br />
<br />
Apparently all the bosses seem to have something that causes problems for the other bosses.<br />
<br />
Archavon<br />
<br />
- Archavon's Chocking Cloud spell extinguishes Koralon's Cinder's.<br />
<br />
Koralon<br />
<br />
- Koralon's Cinder's and Flame Breath spells in some way damage/kill Emalon's elemental adds.<br />
<br />
Emalon<br />
<br />
- Either Emalon's Chain Lightning or Lightning Nova spells (possibly both) cause Archavon to falter and lose his grip on raid members in his grasp.<br />
<br />
Truth be told I have no clue if any of these are accurate it's only what I've dug up, if anyone can find any information to add to his please do.</div></div><hr />

It was obviously taken seconds after the kill as the achievements are still spammed in chat, and there's still a few seconds left on Replenishment and Elemental Oath. Koralon was obviously the last to be killed, since the &quot;Koralon casts Meteor Fists&quot; emote is on the screen.<br />
<br />
But where are the fires? I'm pretty sure they don't despawn as soon as you kill him as I've seen people die from fire after the kill, when his room looks like a firey mess.

<br />
nterestingly enough there is a tactic I've heard, but yet to find proven.<br />
<br />
Apparently all the bosses seem to have something that causes problems for the other bosses.<br />
<br />
Archavon<br />
<br />
- Archavon's Chocking Cloud spell extinguishes Koralon's Cinder's.<br />
<br />
Koralon<br />
<br />
- Koralon's Cinder's and Flame Breath spells in some way damage/kill Emalon's elemental adds.<br />
<br />
Emalon<br />
<br />
- Either Emalon's Chain Lightning or Lightning Nova spells (possibly both) cause Archavon to falter and lose his grip on raid members in his grasp.<br />
<br />
Truth be told I have no clue if any of these are accurate it's only what I've dug up, if anyone can find any information to add to his please do.<br />
even if all those're true, they have no baring on the fight, so what if archavon's extinguishes the fire, what're you gon do, sit in the fire and just wait for archavon to jump on it to extinguish it? and so what if koralon kills emalon's adds? what're you gon do, just wait for ignore them during overcharges and just hope that koralon kills them in time? and so what if emalon makes archavon drop the tank? what're you gon do, let archavon wipe the raid and just hope that emalon lightning novas at the perfect time? i've spent too much time on this load of bullshit</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortac</div><div class="date">2009-09-15, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright I'm gonna speculate some on tactics here.<br />
<br />
First off, class setup:<br />
<br />
Tanks<br />
Feral Druid (tanks Archavon + Emalon's adds -- +5% melee/ranged crit)<br />
Warrior (tanks Emalon or Koralon)<br />
Paladin (tanks Emalon or Koralon -- BoK + Devotion Aura)<br />
<br />
Healers<br />
Druid (ToL +6% healing + GotW + Revitalize)<br />
Priest (Fortitude)<br />
Paladin (Beacon + BoW/BoM + Fire Resistance Aura)<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
Shaman (Totems, Bloodlust)<br />
Warlock (+HP)<br />
Druid (+5% spell crit, EaM +12% spell damage)<br />
<br />
That leaves one spot, which I'm thinking a shadow priest would fill nicely, however I think there would be several options. There could be another tank as that would provide both additional control and certain DPS, but another healer would also work. One thing that crosses my mind is if a fourth tank is used (or even a DPS DK) to Death Grip and control Emalon's overcharged minions.<br />
<br />
As for strategy I'd guess that all healers and DPS would be placed in the middle of the instance where they could reach all tanks and bosses without having to move too much considering three things: #1 Everyone must be reached by at least one healer; #2 less needed mobility equals more dps; and #3 some space must be available to move away from Koralon's fires while avoiding #2.<br />
<br />
Then as for killing order, I'd say Koralon is brought down to low HP first to be able to kill him off quickly once his damage boost is getting too high to be on the verge of causing a wipe. Other than that, I don't doubt that Emalon is focused on after that and then killed first. All bosses obviously need low HPs before the first kill is done. Obviously Bloodlust and other cooldowns are used at this moment when all bosses will be killed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, probably a lot of things I'm missing here, but I suppose that's how my first try would go if I ever was to attempt this.</div></div><hr />

Quite possibly the greatest shoop I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
There are just two things that detract from it, however.<br />
<br />
- I doubt Ensidia is going to show any kind of classy reaction to this. By Ensidia, I mostly mean their legion of retarded fanboys.<br />
<br />
- It implies that Ensidia actually did do this better than them, which isn't true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10. Desperada once soloed Orgrimmar. All of it.<br />
9. Desperada once died in a raid, because his toon had never died before and he was curious about what people saw when they died. <br />
8. After Desperada died, a Death Knight tried to raise him as a ghoul. Instead of coming back as a ghoul, he came back as Patchwerk. <br />
7. Desperada's Hunter has trained Titan's Grip. <br />
6. Desperada is sponsored in Warcraft by over twenty Fortune 500 companies; he's the majority shareholder in all of them. <br />
5. Desperada once tamed both Acidmaw and Dreadscale. At the same time. <br />
4. Desperada can wear Rogue T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T6, T7, and T9. He could probably wear Rogue T8 too, but he thinks it looks stupid. <br />
3. Desperada is gold capped. Not only on his main, but also on the seven bank alts he's created to hold his extra gold. <br />
2. Not only did Desperada achieve Gladiator rank by clicking, he also did it without a ranged weapon equipped. <br />
1. Desperada no longer clicks. He presses buttons using telekinesis.</div></div><hr />

Half the fight is them not dpsing anything except overcharges while the bosses get walked to Koralon.<br />

Between what I saw there and the screenshot of recount, it seems they had Cbear (mage), Ayanami (rogue), Desperada (hunter), Grullnor (enhancement shaman), and Zan (paladin) for DPS. Client (druid) and Veiled (paladin) tanking. Melarix (shaman) and Monukai (druid) healing. Smoda was either healing as elemental or sleeping, as his damage done was lower than client. Some of them choose a few interesting talent choices.<br />
<br />
It would seem their strat required 2.5 healers until archavon, emalon, or both were dead and Smoda would be able to switch to DPS. My guess is this: <br />
<br />
<br />
Pull Emalon near Koralon's hallway, dps until low.<br />
Hunter pulls Archavon with pet during the fight, misdirects to tank, dps until low.<br />
Engage Koralon with all melee dps standing in front to split meteor fists.<br />
When roughly 1 minute of health is left on Koralon, use Heroism, finish off Archavon and Emalon, then work on Koralon.<br />
Paladin saves Bubble+Sac for either combo flame whirl+lightning nova or bad timing on Overcharge.</div></div><hr />

All this comes from your ego. I'm a binder, so I must be better then you. I have done Yogg-0 25. I'm a better person. Get the fuck out my face with that bullshit. <br />

The simple cold fact of the matter is. <br />
<br />
This &quot;clicker&quot; of yours, took part in the worlds first known, &quot;Earth Wind and Fire (10)&quot; achievment. And you all didn't. Whether he used binds, or clicked the remaining few of his abilitles that WOW UI can't bind for you. Whether, (like myself) he uses X-Perl instead of that Raid Frame addon that you have that automatically gives you the right to preach about a players skill, in the face of an over whelming return arguement.<br />
<br />
Why can't gratz him? And the guild. They really have done a fantastic job. <br />
<br />
Very well done guys. I personally didn't think this acheive would be possible untill at least T10. I'm nowhere near as hardcorre as you guys, so I'll never see what it's like to have to deal with the enraged adds, while avoiding Koralons Fire, Lightning Nova, Archavons Clouds and dealing with Meteor fists. <br />
<br />
Looking forward to your videos though :) <br />

Oh, btw, <br />

Can only agree with you. Why don't people just suck it up and congratulate them? They did something that is hard and people starts to whine about binds... Sad really.<br />
<br />
Another thing is that you can make your binds in blizzUI as secondary buttons so they won't show on actionbar, I do it just for the fun off it when people starts to flame my own screens. ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The DPS requirements for this are easy to determine; you need enough DPS to kill Archavon and Emalon within their 5 and 6 min enrage, followed by Kolaron shortly after 6 minutes (you technically have up to 7 minutes if you pull Emalon first, and kill him right on his enrage, and then have 60 second timer to kill the others, but they seem to have 6.15 on their timer). 2.3 million(arc) + 2.7 million(emalon) + 1.2 million (adds) + 4.1 million (kolaron), so just over 10.3 million in 6minutes, or 360 seconds of 28600 rad dps. <br />
<br />
Split between 6 DPSers that's 4.7k DPS each. So yeh, they just made it. <br />
<br />
Still, if it's so easy to reach those numbers, why isn't everyone doing it? Oh yeh, because IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD TO HEAL ALL THAT DAMAGE. Well ok, the first 2 minutes won't be too bad, but once Kolaron's pulled it'll get really difficult.<br />
<br />
So, gz to them. Pro healers indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most pugs need 3 healers for Kolaron alone. Doing all 3 at same time with 2 healers plus a of-healer is impressive. Gratz to Vanquishe since healers made a awesome job and their dps and tanks did not toke unecessary damage at all to make it possible!!</div></div><hr />

He is obviously a clicker. Wouldn't it be blank if he used a mod, yet there is still the default 1234567890-= on the screen. All the people I know have maximum up to number 8 binded unless you have a freaky hand then you could reach further. Sorry but he is a clicker.<br />
<br />
Congratulations on the kill but I'm not sure many people have been aiming for it but I'm sure this will bring in some motivation to try it. <br />

Yes I do. That is a sterotypical clicker interface. You probably click also looool. Also if you say I have no idea what I'm on about, please take more time to clarify your statement instead of one sentence because that just makes your post incorrect tbh. I'm sorry but seeing his ui and only seeing the default binds and people claiming he isn't a clicker is nonsense. :) I've seen UI's in the past who have hidden binds but all of them have been hidden, not just the default binds showing.<br />
<br />

May as well note, I use the spellbinder addon for most of my keybinding. I don't click all my abilities...<br />
<br />
Also, yes I hit gladiator in s5 when hunters were good. However I did it in 2s playing with a resto druid and fighting dk/pally for 2/3 of the games.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those who look and say OMFG ROFL CLICKER read his post some 10 pages earlier in the thread, it is quoted above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spellbinder (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/spell-binder.aspx) is the addon he is using. It circumvents (for the retards in here, goes around) the standard WoW UI, allowing you to bind spells without using Blizzard's bind system. Therefore, it would not showup on his buttons.<br />
<br />
Most of you that claim to know so much really need to do research before you open your mouth and prove that you know NOTHING.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vayron</div><div class="date">2009-09-16, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets just say for a moment that he is a clicker. Fine. So friggin what?<br />
I'm from the server from another higher end raid guild (a couple ranks below Vanquish/Reawaken - the top alliance and horde guilds). He plays his class better than the far majority of other players. The fact that he clicks doesn't make him inferior, less skilled, etc etc etc. <br />
He did it. You haven't. I haven't. Doesn't make him better or worse than us. Means he's accomplished something that only 9 other people have. I'd be willing to guess they didn't 9 man it and drag him along for the achievement just for kicks. Could be wrong but I'd bet that he performed his job very very well, and does it on a regular basis. Maybe...hard to say...clickers...geez..they couldn't possibly play well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides...Spellbinder....clicking....hotkeys...magic one buttons....who cares. He plays far better than most of you (us?) ever will. Get over it. <br />
<br />
GJ to Vanquish. I already said it in-game to a few of you but may as well on here too. Forget what these asshats say and carry on. Don't let Foofy and the gang beat you! :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bx</div><div class="date">2009-09-16, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait did they just pull them all into the same area? That kind of makes it easy, most guilds assumed incorrectly that the original pre-3.2 leashes were still in place on each boss. Without the leash it makes this fight pretty trivial.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was watching their attempts last week via Xfire...... it is not &quot;pretty trivial&quot; haha<br />
<br />
You got:<br />
<br />
Emalon making a massive point blank AoE<br />
Emalon shooting Chain Lightnings<br />
4 Tempest Minions, 1 of which is getting overcharged (and gaining an extra damage buff against the tank until he dies)<br />
Archavon shooting Rock Shards on random people<br />
Archavon stunning the raid (!) and charging (nope, can't stack up to avoid it, Emalon will wipe the raid with 1 chain lightning)<br />
Koralon being a lawn sprinkler of fiery goodness<br />
Koralon's Meteor Fists<br />
Koralon putting fiery puddles all over the ground<br />
<br />
All in a 30 yard radius.<br />
<br />
And having 60 seconds from the 1st boss death to the last boss death.<br />
<br />
Think about it: You get a 10 man raid of super-pro players, geared out, and your tank keeps getting one-shotted when Meteor Fists and Rock Shards coincide. Finally, after X attempts, you pull it off, you kill Koralon. Yay! But then, when you think you have it in the bag, someone stands in fire for too long, a healer makes a judgement call, tops that guy off, and a tank goes down when he is dealing with 4 adds, Emalon, and Rock Shards. Koralon is dead, you wiped, and you can NOT complete this for an entire week because you wiped with 1 boss dead.<br />
<br />
It is just too ridiculous to comprehend, really<br />
<br />
