The Mage Tower has been completed on North American realms! This grants:<br />
<br />
<br />
Access to the solo challenge scenarios that unlock new Artifact appearances <br />
Veiled Wyrmtongue Chests, which are more lucrative<br />
Portals to different Broken Shore zones<br />
Knowledgeable (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/237137-knowledgeable) - When you loot an item which grants Artifact Power in a Raid or Dungeon, there's a chance you will receive a bonus Artifact Power token.<br />

<br />
<br />
The Mage Tower will remain active for three days, so use these buffs wisely. The Artifact challenge scenario is very difficult.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your first attempt at the scenario is free<br />
Subsequent attempts cost 100 x Nethershard (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1226-nethershard) each<br />
The challenge varies based on your spec<br />
<br />

From what I've seen it's Rogue, Resto Shaman, Mage, and WW. I don't know more details than that but that's what was said in the Havoc part of the DH discord with a Rogue SS holding up the daggers. Quite a few people apparently already have low % wipes on the fights as well based on the quick reading of the chatter I did through other discords.</div></div><hr />

Well, all three can apparently be up at once .... but ours ended up being predominantly the least useful one first (Mage Tower).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean to be fair, looking at the above Screenshot (I'm at work, so haven't attempted/really know anything about it yet.), the bosses have about 100M HP. I know from the elite WQ bosses that I can easily knock off about 20-30% of that with my on-pull burst (912 Moonkin) (more with flask/food buff/Potion/BL Drums). So the main challenge is just going to be learning the mechanics so that I can survive the remaining (likely) 50-60% (although, changing to my &quot;lay on feet&quot; boots will probably make the surviving part a lot easier.)<br />
<br />
Either way, I guess my point is that people with appropriate legionaries/decently high ilvl are probably going to have a pretty easy time with it right out of the gate</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about that, the Nether Disruptor seems like it has the potential for some epic fail, given that it's only up for 3 days.(I.E. waiting for someone to finish on a Friday, rather than Monday night/Tues Afternoon)<br />
<br />
And I don't think the Command Centre has any benefit to raiding? (Or is this the one that summons World Bosses? I forget, thought that was Disruptor)</div></div><hr />

Yes. Once a building is destroyed you'll have to wait 24 hours before you can start reconstructing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think saying 1% is a pretty big exaggeration. They only seem to have 100M-ish HP for the DPS challenge, unless they white hit super hard (Basically making a really short enrage), I'd saying anyone like 880+ could probably pull it off with the right survival set-up/after learning the mechanics of the challenge. Although, as I mentioned, this is just based off of third hand info/screenshots until I get home.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah - but the Mage Tower is pretty much guaranteed to be epic fail for the vast majority of people attempting the primary reward.<br />
<br />
Oh - and I get the reward of double AP for the next three days where I've just finished all the dungeon raid content for the week... whoo hoo!!<br />

<br />
A dps just came out saying the boss at 300M health complaining it was too hard. 300M seems about right if it is tuned for ToS.<br />
<br />
I can manage 60M or so if a boss doesn't do too much unavailable damage... (Arcane Mage).</div></div><hr />

The majority of casual players don't raid, so that extra tokens / gear upgrades basically means nothing to them. They just want to unlock flying ASAP to do more world content like leveling alts or doing their daily world quests. Even if it is only a day or 2 faster.</div></div><hr />

Yes... I do, however the other towers have active functions which are of benefit immediately to more people. <br />

As has already been said, we do *NOT* get the 30% rep from the current mage tower. The companion app is the only source which says so and it is wrong. Its &quot;Chance for double AP token&quot; in raids and dungeons. It is not bad, but is it really better than the &quot;Chance to get your Seal of BF back&quot; from the nether disruptor?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it's portals for the broken shore (not bad again, but the island is not really that big) and better Wyrmtongue chests. For those, no idea how good they are, but they have to be pretty good to be better than Cathedral World quests &amp; Companion Challenge missions or worldbosses which drop 880 loot.</div></div><hr />

You're also making the asumption that the gear that they give is of value to everyone, which is nowhere close to being true. World bosses and bonus rolls are of no value to me at the moment (On my main at least, which is what i'm building for), so i'd rather take the extra AP,<br />

Opening the mage tower lets me know what the challenge is, and will allow me to better prepare for it the next time it is around.<br />

Seems most Americans either can't read or don't have reading comprehension. As evidenced even in this thread where some seem to think the mage tower currently has the rep buff, people just don't look at the current buffs nor understand the buff is random each time the building is built. Just because the building CAN have a rep buff doesn't mean it has it right now. This time, it does not have the rep buff. It has the chance at a second AP token buff. BIG difference.<br />
<br />
To be fair, if you use the app, it says the mage tower gives the rep buff which isn't true if you paid attention to what buff it has in the game. So that's partially Blizzard's fault. But it's also the player's fault for not double checking what buff the buildings give in game versus what the app says. So it's also partly to blame on the idiocy of the player base.<br />
<br />
So yay. We're stuck with a worthless building for the next few days until the Legion destroys it and maybe we'll get a decent buff next time. Wonder how many complaints will pop up once the building's destroyed because people don't know that it can (and will) be destroyed. Guess we'll have to see what building is finished next and if it'll be done before the mage tower is destroyed.<br />

You need invasions in 4 different zones. At least with my Information, that's 6k Reputation for completing each invasion once.<br />

Can't verify (it's 94% still on EU) but at this rate I won't bother, why waste 10k nethershards on this &quot;challenge&quot; when you could buy 2 item tokens instead, I don't even know why everyone rushed the mage tower, I'd rather have the world boss building first for my alts to get free 890 gear. <br />

And the main draw for the Mage Tower is 100% the artifact power. That's the reason I dumped all my resources into it. Don't really care about the artifact appearance, although I did get my frost one in an hour or so of attempts.<br />
<br />
Not sure why so many people are complaining about it, it was literally secondary to the artifact power gains. Secondary by a lot. And AP leads to guaranteed power gains, while the disruptor leads to more RNG related power gains.</div></div><hr />

LOL, sure it is, pal.<br />
<br />
You show me where you can get gear equivalent to (oh sorry, better than, since apparently its better for casuals than raiders) mythic raid drops, and I'll agree with you. Go on, I'll be sitting over here waiting.<br />

I spent a good 2k shards on attempts and never made it past the first stage. I absolutely LOVE that its too difficult for me and it gives me something to work towards. I truly hope that blizzard doesn't nerf this but, sadly, i think they will. Americans in general don't like working towards a difficult goal, they just want the bar lowered so they can step over it and, thanks to capitalism, the majority rules.</div></div><hr />

I'm a resto druid, I've attempted in 6 or 7 times, and I didn't get very far. I'm at 901 ilvl. I do not want them to nerf it, once I git gud and get more gear from nighthold/m+/ToS I'll be able to tackle it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you define how good something is completely by its rewards? Because that just doesn't make sense. Mythic raiding gets the highest gear because it takes the most combination of skill, effort, and time, and always has. Its literally how the game has always been. Proportionate wise, its not close in my opinion. Heroics give gear that is, not only a few ilvls lower than mythic, it has the chance to actually be as good or even better, and takes far, far less effort. And the very best items in the game are attainable by anyone doing anything, not just mythic raiding. Its been easier than ever before to get geared, and staying competitive in a mythic guild has taken far, far more effort than ever before, which is why the mythic raiding scene is in such a steep decline. There has also been more single player progression than ever before in the form of the artifact weapon progression, and more small group progression than ever before in the form of mythic plus dungeons.<br />

I'm literally just going by what I've seen stated in chat, on forums, and on this very thread by people that aren't complaining, and by what the answer was when I asked what building we're going for. The conversations mostly went like this:<br />
&quot;Hey, what building are we building first?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mage tower for the AP&quot;<br />

Oh yes, my bad. You totally thwarted me. You have proven, without a doubt, that there's nothing but shit gear in mythic raids. Not a single piece of gear in there is better than what you can get from a world boss or LFR or emissary cache. Yep! Not a single one! It's all crap! Boohoohooo, those poooooor mythic raiders!</div></div><hr />

Yep! Not a single one! It's all crap! Boohoohooo, those poooooor mythic raiders! Strawman at its best. I so knew people like you are just gonna disregard everything and push their agenda. It's not enough people who put minimal effort get a few amazing items some mythic raiders might never see drop, after all, it's not ALL the items so problem doesn't exist. <br />
<br />
<br />
This expansion is literally the most casual friendly Yep, exactly see case above, Blizzard decided to spoil casuals by throwing loot at them left and right and they still claim it's not casual friendly enough. Back in vanilla they barely seen an epic and still thought it was an amazing game, today they're decked in titanforged epics and legendaries and they're like: <br />
Fuck you casuals (and by casually mean everyone outside of the &gt;1% of the playerbase)! Fuck you in the ass!!!&quot; --Blizzard, because fuck you that's why What's the point of spoiling these people if they're never satisfied, it's never enough for them. <br />
<br />
P.S. I'm sure by the time Argus patch drops casuals will get access to easy 900 gear from world quests or something similar, so it's not as if they will need to step a foot into organized raiding or mythic+ to try the challenge before expansion ends. Even now you can get 900 gear without mythic raiding, just pug hc NH and farm m+. <br />
<br />
You can also farm nethershards for the 5k tokens and with enough luck &amp; effort you'll get the necessary gear by the time next mage tower is built.</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha.<br />
<br />
So, basically, you agree. Only mythic raiders deserve to have the best gear AND the most fun gear. Everyone else just gets to sit there and &quot;be bad&quot; because they don't deserve to have fun in the game. If you're not doing mythic raids, you're not &quot;playing the game right,&quot; amirite?<br />
<br />
Hate to break it to you, but not everyone likes to raid, let alone deal with elitists doucenozzles like you in mythic raiding guilds. Some people enjoy the other aspects of the game, and constantly -- constantly getting the middle finger from Blizzard when it comes to the fun stuff (cool mounts, cool-looking gear, cool titles, etc.) they, at best, get token shit or have to wait ages and ages so that the aforementioned elitist douchenozzles get the opportunity to truly feel elitst.<br />
<br />
And yet people like you -- and Blizzard -- are constantly baffled by how so many people constantly complain and feel like shit in regards to the game. Yes, it's truly baffling...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, exactly see case above, Blizzard decided to spoil casuals by throwing loot at them left and right and they still claim it's not casual friendly enough.<br />
Hahahhahahaha. Yes. That's exactly what's going on. Put your nose up to those lowly &quot;casuals,&quot; they deserve nothing. NOTHING! So what if they pay the same amount of money each month? So what if they log in for the same amount of time, and do what they enjoy for the same amount of time? None of that matters! Only the elitist douchenozzles deserve the good stuff! Let them eat cake! &lt;watches you toss your hair only moments before getting beheaded, then still being baffled as to why those lowly peons hate you so vehemently&gt;<br />
<br />
I mean, sure, they could have simply made the whole thing scalable to your gear. But naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. Gotta cater to those elitist douchenozzles, else THEY go around crying and crying and crying. You know, like in your bitchfest post...<br />
<br />
Oh sorry, no. You wouldn't do that. Only those lowly casuals do anything like that! Eat cake, casuals! Eat your cake and be happy! Tralalalala!</div></div><hr />

There we go with the 15$ a month comment... You &quot;not douchenozzles&quot; are really old and tiring with your arguments. If you bothered to read I just pointed out you can easily get 900 ilvl without getting in touch with any of these awfully douchenozzlistic mythic raids. Mythic+ dungeons / heroic raids are enough. You can even get some of the best gear from the 5k nethershard tokens that requires absolutely no group play at all (even though it's more efficient in a group). But yeah, some people enjoy clicking squirrels all day, why aren't they rewarded all the best stuff? Why, Blizzard, why? <br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, sure, they could have simply made the whole thing scalable to your gear. You mean like proving grounds so Mr Cheeser McCheeserson could go in naked just with his artifact and best trinkets, have really low ilvl overall to scale down the mob HP and crap on everything? <br />
<br />
<br />
constantly getting the middle finger from Blizzard when it comes to the fun stuff (cool mounts, cool-looking gear, Tell me one cool mount a casual can't get in Legion, or some recolor thereof. Even the mythic Gul'dan mount / pvp Gladiator mount have recolored versions casuals can get (normal mode raiding is for casuals, not hardcore btw). Same with cool-looking gear, you can get a recolour of everything with just slight differences from mythic raid / elite pvp set, and if the mythic / elite set is better or worse is debatable, because some of them have too much stuff going on them. For example mythic t20 for druids looks worse than the non-mythic one. <br />
<br />
<br />
So what if they log in for the same amount of time, and do what they enjoy for the same amount of time? None of that matters! Only the elitist douchenozzles deserve the good stuff! Let them eat cake! &lt;watches you toss your hair only moments before getting beheaded, then still being baffled as to why those lowly peons hate you so vehemently&gt; <br />
<br />
Yep, another prime example of Blizzard spoiling casuals this expansion, give them an inch they'll go a mile. After all it's the same 15$ a month! We all have the same stomachs, communism shall rule! (And we all know too well how happy were the peasants under communist rule after they executed all the filthy aristocrats, right?) <br />
<br />
Why should it matter if a guy logs in to spend 4 hours doing raids, dungeons, pvp or running laps around Dalaran? It's 15$ a month, damn you Blizzard, stop discriminating people who prefer running circles in major cities, such unfairness. <br />
<br />
Maybe you want your challenge artifact appearance sent in a mail package as well, after all you paid your sub and donated to mage tower, you deserve it. Why should you bother farming m+ or nethershards for gear, you should be able to stroll in wearing levelling greens, some people don't enjoy farming gear but enjoy getting artifact appearances, Blizzard should give you all the &quot;fun&quot; on a silver platter and require no effort or dedication in return. Or maybe you should be able to buy it in the in-game store. After all, it's just a cosmetic like the mystic runesaber and jewel of the firelord.</div></div><hr />
