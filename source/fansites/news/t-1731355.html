Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Character Boosting a Protection Paladin was not granting Cold Weather Flying.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rolling on Spirit and Bonus Armor Gear<br />
Both Spirit and Bonus Armor are intended to help restrict the number of people in a given raid who may be interested in a particular item. The OP makes a perfect argument as to why we want that distinction: he wanted the Blackiron Micro Crucible, but had resigned himself to only really having a shot at it from a bonus roll or a cache as there were so many others in his raid group who wanted it too. That's a crappy situation.<br />
<br />
Bonus Armor is currently working well for creating that distinction. DPS specializations don't get anything from it, but it's far and away the best stat for tanks -- so much so that tanks will nearly always prefer an item that grants Bonus Armor over an item that doesn't, even if the item with no Bonus Armor is much higher in item level. <br />
<br />
Prior to 6.1, we were getting a ton of feedback from tanks who were extremely disappointed to receive trinkets, rings, etc. with no Bonus Armor through their bonus rolls. It felt like a waste of a seal or cache to get something that your loot spec would realistically never equip. Plus, it's a bit of a false lead for inexperienced players; if Blizzard gave me a higher item level crit/multistrike amulet via bonus rolls, it must be an upgrade, right?<br />
<br />
We got similar feedback from many healers, which caused us to take a look at how Spirit was functioning. Ultimately, we want Spirit to work similarly: a stat that's so good, you want it everywhere you can get it. If that's not the case for you, we'd like to fix that by making Spirit more attractive, not by making you want to equip non-Spirit items (and fight with half your raid over them).<br />
<br />
We made some changes along those lines in 6.1 (such as the Mistweaver changes to Mana Tea). We feel that, with those changes, we're now in a position now where healers should always prefer Spirit pieces in the ring, neck, and back slots. The nature of trinkets makes them a little less cut-and-dry: in the vast majority of situations, you should prefer the Spirit trinket, but there could conceivably be a situation in which a DPS trinket would give better performance. We're still discussing what (if any) changes would need to be made to prevent those niche occurrences, but again, our goal is that you don't want the DPS trinkets.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Lore that is not always how stat optimization works. I'll take a dps haste trinket over spirit any day for the purpose it serves me, but removing my ability to bonus roll on said item drastically hurts my gearing process.<br />
If that's the case, then our fix would be to either make the Spirit trinket better or the DPS trinket worse for healers. We don't want DPS and healers fighting over the same trinkets. <br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Arena Skirmish Healer Spec Bug<br />
There is indeed a bug with skirmish queues at the moment that's causing healers to be forced into DPS specs. We've got a hotfix on the way for it, but it won't take effect until server restarts (which currently aren't planned until normal maintenance time). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364272-arena-skirmish-spec-bug/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16410481593?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Legendary Follower Abilities<br />
I am not sure if they were trolls but apparently thie &quot;Legendary&quot; follower only has 2 abilities and 3 traits like an epic.<br />
Ultimately, adding another ability didn’t feel Legendary to us especially given that most players have solid ability coverage across their existing group of followers. Instead, we put the extra “Legendary” into a trait that acts like an ability that can counter anything. This felt awesome and like the right direction to take Legendary followers. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364263-garona-only-has-2-abilities/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16527912747?page=1#10))<br />
<br />
Legacy Content Gold Changes<br />
Historically &quot;escort&quot; and &quot;breadcrumb&quot; type quests that just ask you to talk to an NPC have always given little or no gold. There was no intended change here, and I believe that no change occurred. It's possible that there's a subtle bug, but numerous posters in this thread seem to report that gold rewards from quests while leveling are in fact unchanged. If there are specific examples of quests that used to award gold, but which no longer do, we'd be interested in hearing about them here, or on our Bug Report forum.<br />
<br />
Gold from questing is an essential source of gold for leveling and max-level players alike, and not something we would suddenly and wordlessly remove or reduce.<br />
<br />
If someone could provide screenshots of specific item nerfs, this would be helpful. Since they are saying no nerfs are intentional, it is beneficial to show them the nerfs that are in place so they can reverse them ASAP.<br />
That's a separate issue from quest gold, which was not changed at all to my knowledge. Several legacy items (old epic gems, and crafting reagents like Crusader Orbs, Chaos Orbs, Sulfuron Ingots, etc.) were significantly reduced in vendor value in order to limit the impact of an exploit. These items honestly don't constitute a very large portion of total gold earnings from running old raids and dungeons, compared to boss gold drops and vendored weapons and armor. Because the change was exploit-oriented, it was excluded from our patch notes, but it probably should have been messaged more clearly in order to avoid surprise. <br />
<br />
Again, as a matter of philosophy, we find nothing at all wrong with players making a non-trivial amount of gold from something like a weekly Black Temple or Icecrown transmog run at max level. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364251-no-more-gold-for-wotlk-nor-cata/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16544034359?page=13#258))<br />

<br />
Agreed, also Margok was a fun figth but way too long, this boss duration is much better imo, 16 minute fights are a pain to progress on if youre not a top world guild that raids like 100 hours per day, you get way too few pulls a day when youre finaly getting cloe to a kill since the fight lasts forever.</div></div><hr />

I don't think its that it's not that it's &quot;hard enough looking&quot;, it's that it wasn't anything extremely cool added, like Cho'gall busting in for Highmaul.<br />

Why are the rogues keeping feint up 24/7 on last phase ? Some sort of raidwide AoE going on even outside the smashes ? Also it seemed like a pivotal part of theyre strat since someone was calling for Feint refresh non stop.<br />

Agreed, also Margok was a fun figth but way too long, this boss duration is much better imo, 16 minute fights are a pain to progress on if youre not a top world guild that raids like 100 hours per day, you get way too few pulls a day when youre finaly getting cloe to a kill since the fight lasts forever.<br />
<br />
The longer you stay in phase 3, the more aoe ticking damage the entire raid takes from simply being on the platform.</div></div><hr />

Rogues were absorbing the smash and using shadow step as soon as it hit to get back to the boss.</div></div><hr />

That part I got, I wanted to know why they were keeping feint up outside smashes, but it was already explained. Fight doesnt seen complicated at all, it just seens to be super tighly tuned wich makes it quite hard. Stras arent at all complex tough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Reduces Gold from Questing with each Expansion without any words.<br />
<br />
Its not though? Keep in mind doing quests at max level often gives extra gold, because theres a gold bonus to make up for not getting any xp. When you're still levelling, you're getting the xp instead, so no bonus.</div></div><hr />

Adding a mythic only-phase to every last boss would become very old very fast. Not all bosses needs an extra phase to be epic. Just p1 itself looks horrible enough on mythic, and adding a p4 would kinda be too much.</div></div><hr />

And adding almost nothing won't get old? I don't quite understand.. How is adding new phases for tier bosses on mythic anything but interesting? How else could they make it interesting?</div></div><hr />

First of all it's a great video about Sylvanas. <br />
Second: If Sylvanas wouldn't have the ability to break control over undeads...how do you think the Forsaken could survive if the LK would just have to come around the corner and control them again? She is the leader of the Forsaken for a reason....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you should learn to read first, Terms of Service does not equal Terms of Use, do I have to bash your head against the wall before you get it? It's evident that you guys are trying to imbue a new meaning to statement but it doesn't work, maybe if you work closely like these guys and trust each other maybe you guys can use the account sharing strat instead of attacking each other?<br />
<br />
They can account share as much as they want, however if it comes compromised the Services Blizzard can offer to restore it to original account is limited. Not like they do much anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gold equiv always follows exp value. As you outlevel older dailies, the gold drops until you reach gray quest minimum for that level quest. Always works this way and would nit be announved as a &quot;change&quot;</div></div><hr />

So if ONE person makes a mistake the whole raid should wipe? WTF is wrong with you? Do you ENJOY bashing your head into a brick wall? Lest we forget that LAG is STILL an issue and happens to this day. Or should the raid should wipe because someone caught a lag spike and wasn't able to pop some heals in time? GTFO here with that bullshit.:mad:</div></div><hr />
