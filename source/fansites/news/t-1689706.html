Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Ulduar-style teleporters would be very useful in raids with optional bosses.<br />
Yeah, the system in Highmaul definitely breaks down if you do Ko'ragh then want to double back and work on a boss you missed. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/554325456929845248))<br />
<br />
Could you please force loot system to be personal only in the first 2 weeks of heroic raids, to discourage the alt whoring? Ppl should play alts beacuse they like to play alts or try a different class, not because the mains gearing benefit is so huge. I feel like the whole effort I put during the first weeks of WoD (garrison, CMs, apexis) is eclipsed by the powerful HC loot. You can't get loot you already have in the first week since it's the first time everyone does that content, so no item is wasted. It can happen in the 2nd week (when mythic is released), but it's still a much better compromise. And since your goal is to have stats as close as possible across the specs, there shouldn't be much whining about it either. I'm in a 3day raiding guild, top 100 ranked in SoO and this is slowly becoming mandatory for us as well. I'm curious what your stance on this matter is. Are you happy with it? Looking for solutions?<br />
Not happy with it, but restricting millions of players to save a few hundred from themselves doesn't seem like an ideal solution. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/554654475667767296))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Mentioned it several times that I no longer share plans about the game on Twitter. Hit up @WarcraftDevs for any announcements. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/550778908573200384))<br />
So then why do you talk about WoW on your twitter? seems kind of odd..<br />
I like interacting with fans. I think it's important for a dev to empathize with players. Also bugs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/554518571909271552))<br />

The Elder Scrolls Online Drops Subscriptions<br />
The Elder Scrolls Online is dropping subscriptions less than a year after release. Starting on March 17th, 2015, players can just purchase the game and play forever. The same applies to the console version, coming on June 9, 2015.<br />
<br />
There will be an optional premium membership called ESO Plus that grants access to DLC content, gives bonuses to character progression speed, and gives players some shop currency. If that membership expires, players will lose access to the DLC areas and quests unless they have purchased them separately, but will keep items and rewards. <br />

I hope he meant that, coz he says that next ptr build will be mainly discussion.<br />
Still it's frikin frustrating especially as mage, i spent 3 gcds to get 1 pyroblast proc that bearly does 20-30k crit (30k with trinket and incanters flow stacks). Lets don't even mention that mage is all about aoe burst, which is completely useless against rogue with feint, or just stacked targets.<br />
I main mage since early tbc, and i consider myself as pretty good one, and im tired of losing against scrubs who just rerolled the FoTM with insta 90 boost, and have absolutely 0 idea what they are doing, but still getting carried by their class.</div></div><hr />

Star Wars the Old Republic answered that for me, it was a great MMO but it only lasted a couple of months before people left in large streams.<br />

Wish they would stop making MMO's as we've got more than enough of those and start making co-op based RPG's where you can play a game like Skyrim, KOTOR, Dragon Age with a group of friends in the same game world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically they came too late to the party, WoW came at the right time when there were very few MMO's around. All new MMO's have tried and failed in some form, especially those trying for the sub based system.<br />
<br />
Those that started out as f2p or b2p have their own communities and will last, there was a list posted here somewhere that showed at least 100 if not 200 MMO's of all types.. And this is the problem the big players have they have to compete with so many other MMO's.. Bethesda tried to cash in on the MMO craze and like EA and others they did not fair to well at all..</div></div><hr />

You are wrong then, cause ESO is going B2P not F2P.<br />
<br />
<br />
isn't elder scrolls online basically dead and they aren't considering any of the story in that part of the actual lore<br />
<br />
Nope, anyone who still plays ESO will tell you the servers are quite packed and you see people leveling all the time. And the story is quite good, some of the best in the MMO industry.</div></div><hr />

Fire and arcane mages are doing quite fine, as they always do, they require gear, blizzard is giving them a small buff in 6.1 because when BRF comes out Fire will be top DPS, they are very close. I know plenty of Arcane mages and they say they are quite happy with how they are playing. If you are talking about PvP I believe arcane is at its best point it has ever been I. The way of PvP. I don't know how you play, but I do believe you need to learn about mages more, they always go through these stages.<br />
<br />
Fire is usually near bottom at the a start of an expac because they NEED crit and its hard to come by early, but blizz has fixed that quite well I find by giving our passives that increase crit buffs. I love my fire mage right now, if you think they still need a buff, start doing some real PvE in Heroic/mythic content. If your a PvPer just be patient till you get the gear you need, then you will be strong enough in that sense.<br />
<br />
If neither of those work, I suggest playing an easier class.</div></div><hr />

Nope, anyone who still plays ESO will tell you the servers are quite packed and you see people leveling all the time. And the story is quite good, some of the best in the MMO industry.<br />

<br />
They are doing what the devs of GW2 and similar did, people buy the game and can then play without paying for a sub.. If they want the added extra's then they pay a sub like those who play Rift and SWoTOR you can play for free but have to pay for the added extra's..<br />

Merely being objective, good sir. The biggest hype surrounding ESO (even now) was the hate surrounding the game - amplified by people like TotalBiscuit and AngryJoe. If you actually play the game and get into endgame content, you'll see how good it really is. <br />
<br />
There are some problems with target healing (PvE), balance issues in Cyrodiil (PvP), and the veteran rank (VR) system is a complete and utter grind - which is what I think made most people unsub. <br />
<br />
With that said, I can honestly say I think WoW has more problems atm than ESO. At least ESO isn't a bunch of minigames, it has actual real content and leveling is actually enjoyable. In WoW, I enjoyed the first zone I quested in (Shadowmoon) and the introduction to WoD questline, and that was it. Garrisons, pet battles, and WoWs many other mini-games are not my cup of tea... The entire meat of the game is raiding today. Everything else feels like a tertiary afterthought by Blizzard, to my dismay.<br />
<br />
Oh, and did I mention ESO's community is infinitely friendlier/superior to WoW's. WoW has become incredibly toxic. It's refreshing to have nice, friendly helpful people - something I hadn't experienced since LOTRO or early WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Well said. You've got to justify that subscription with a product that is worth the investment. ESO and WildStar are more of the same in a long line of half-assed superifical MMOs that were cobbled together, with hefty marketing hype, as quick &amp; dirty cash grabs.</div></div><hr />

I do about 27k on my hunter in mostly LFR gear. Last night, in my guild run, I was consistently at about 10th on dps with a little over 20k dps on rogue as assassination with 547 gear on. With that same gear as say mage or fury war, I would be pumping out the same as the hunter. A 30%gap between classes is not good, and assassination is about the most braindead easy rotation ever.<br />

So you are last on a single fight, and in the lower 3rd on 2 - While being top tier for the most important boss. Sorry to break it to you, but other classes are performing a lot worse overall.</div></div><hr />

Single target is perfect, all in our raid are in between 32-36k dps, and these 4k are within range of RNG. With bad luck the one with 36k have only 32k and so on. The last thing we would want (except mages and warlocks) is that mages and warlocks become top dps everywhere once again. They are fine right now, there is always one of three specs that is competitive at given scenario. <br />
<br />
The numbers tweaks are only needed for cleave and aoe fights, and a little number tweaks between clasess specs such as arcane being so much stronger single target than fire and beast mastery never used by hunters. Shamans and warriors 100k dps on thrash, rest 50k ? Moonkins 1gcd starfall hits harder than priest channeling mindsear for 10s? Also some of talents on the same tier providing 15% more dmg than the other.</div></div><hr />

Played it already, it's not that &quot;better than wow&quot;, sorry.<br />
<br />
And you say it yourself... &quot;If you actually play the game and get into endgame content, you'll see how good it really is.&quot;, wich is the same as saying wow is all about the endgame.<br />
<br />
Btw, WoW was always about raiding and high end pvp. The rest isn't &quot;mini games&quot;, it's secondary systems that do mix with the game. If you want to put everything else other than raid as a mini-game, you'll get it in all games (dailies are mini games, reputation grind is a mini game since you get it and it's done, you won't use it again later or next content, etc.). Also using the community as a selling point... that's old already. Toxic people are everywhere. It's according to the size of your game, but the toxic ratio is always there.</div></div><hr />

It's not only about rotation, thankfully. Other factors as awareness, situational decisions, etc. (at least that's what I noted). Also, 27k dps on single target with 645 ilvl ?

<br />
If you're doing top DPS at 20k Single Target, your raid group is terrible. I do that as middle of the pack (3rd to 5th on meters, depending on fight, higher if it's a multi-boss fight like Tectus). Hunters are ridiculous atm (the 2 on my team regularly smoke me on meters) as are Retadins and Frost Mages. If you're topping meters as a Rogue, the other DPSers on your team need to step their game up.<br />
<br />
It's not a L2P issue. Rogues were upper-to-top just prior to launch, now we're down towards middle of the pack. It blows. We're bangin' it out in PvP, but if you don't PvP, you don't see that aspect of it. <br />
<br />
Rogues need help. Not as much as WW monks and Destro locks, but they do need help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is customer service costs. It is very hard to have a pure B2P MMORPG unless customer support consists of players helping other players on forums. Most players do not grasp how expensive it is to provide live GMs. Even WOW is constantly adding more features to the game whoÂ´s sole purpose is to reduce GM tickets. For instance, anyone else notice that they implemented a guild leadership feature where if the Guildmaster is inactive for 3 months, an automatic system kicks in. No more needing to put a ticket. The WOW devs are constantly checking out what people are putting in tickets for, and then programming an auto-fix for it.<br />
<br />
I actually like the TESO model of F2P. Because you still have to spend $60 to play the game, it will keep immature people from spamming the low level zones and being obnoxious.. something that always seems to happen when a game goes f2p. As far as the DLC, I donÂ´t know enough about the game, but it could be that you could play for a year or more and not need that content. <br />
<br />
I didnÂ´t like early TESO though, to me they removed the best parts of Skyrim and added the worst parts of MMORPGs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that: Why on earth did MMOC/Curse make frontpage news about ESO? MMO-Champion is a WoW (Blizzard-games) news website as far as I've been aware for the past several years and according to MMOC itself. I'm bothered with it because specifically publishing an article about ESO (or any other game) cancelling subs is what causes flamewar-threads and posts on here. They know the whole ''Blizzard should (not) go F2P''-discussion causes !@#$loads of drama. I'm not even mixing myself into that discussion, as I want to avoid drama, but it's like MMOC actually wants to create drama this time. (Otherwise MMOC would post news like this about other games more often.)<br />

<br />
I played the beta. I'm not surprised at all. While it had it's moments, I was underwhelmed, and I stated at the time that while I would probably play, I'd wait for it to go F2P. It just didn't have anything I was willing to pay a subscription for, and it was the sentiment I heard from a lot of other beta testers at the time. I called the same thing with SWTOR after I beta tested that. To SWTOR's credit, the horrible game responsiveness that I've complained about in the past has gotten better. It's still not perfect, but it's better.</div></div><hr />

It's horrible. Never spent a cent on it, and not even going to go back to it as F2P. I like Elder Scrolls games and that game is just plain old not good. Tries too hard to be an ES game and an MMO at the same time and just waters down both sides.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toclafane</div><div class="date">2015-01-22, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A year or two ago I said to myself that ESO and Wildstar would prove once and for all whether sub-based models are viable outside of WoW.<br />
<br />
I'd say 50% of that is answered.<br />
<br />
I think it's perfectly viable, but the game has to be done right. Incomes are limited, and chances are that if you're paying a sub, most people are only going to pay 1-2 at a time. So you've got to be able to compete with another sub-based model and give folks a reason to be that ONE game they sub to or risk people not being able to afford your game.<br />
<br />
WoW is old, but that's working in its favor. There's a huge amount of content, and there's ten years of tweaking little things here and there to make it better over time. It's also incredibly responsive. The controls are intuitive, particularly if you cut your teeth on older MMOs like Everquest.<br />
<br />
So while it's possible to have a successful sub game out there, it's going to have to be FAR better than the attempts we've seen so far. Problem is, new games in development just aren't going to have the kind of team and money that Blizzard has to throw at a game. As I said before, the closed beta for ESO was not something that overly impressed me. It was good in and of itself, but it wasn't good enough to pay a subscription for if I had to choose between that and WoW.</div></div><hr />

The biggest hype surrounding ESO (even now) was the hate surrounding the game - amplified by people like TotalBiscuit and AngryJoe. If you actually play the game and get into endgame content, you'll see how good it really is.<br />
<br />
The problem is that you have to keep the player engaged long enough for them to keep leveling to get to that endgame content, and that's where ESO fails. If I get so frustrated with the game for various reasons that I stop playing, it's not going to matter what's in that endgame content. I'm not going to pay for &quot;hell weeks&quot; and miss out on something else I'd rather be paying a subscription toward with more enjoyable content. Most people can't afford to pay for multiple subs, so it's not a question of just being okay. You have to be spectacular and worth not playing the rest. ESO isn't.<br />

<br />
LFR is not strictly run by clueless kids, it's a bad generalization. There are also quite a bunch of good players there, running for Abrogator Stones.<br />
<br />
There are also players like me who are former progression raiders and who just got burned out on progression raiding. I could of course pug normal or heroic if I want, but I find that LFR meets my needs for now. There's nothing I particularly want from higher end raiding at the moment. I just want to see the content, and LFR scratches that itch for me. Of course, that doesn't mean that I won't keep up with how to best play my class, and it doesn't mean that I'm going to stand in fire, either. Once you've become accustomed to following mechanics, there's a certain switch that you can't turn off-- unless you're purposely in &quot;let's do this and see what happens&quot; mode. I'll admit... Curiosity happens.</div></div><hr />

Wish they would stop making MMO's as we've got more than enough of those and start making co-op based RPG's where you can play a game like Skyrim, KOTOR, Dragon Age with a group of friends in the same game world.<br />
<br />
Or maybe they must stop aiming for wow sub numbers and consider anything lower as a &quot;failure&quot; and use realistic budgets and be glad with a solid steady profit instead of try to milk the hell out of a game to make billions in a month.

Played it already, it's not that &quot;better than wow&quot;, sorry.<br />
<br />
And you say it yourself... &quot;If you actually play the game and get into endgame content, you'll see how good it really is.&quot;, wich is the same as saying wow is all about the endgame.<br />
<br />
Btw, WoW was always about raiding and high end pvp. The rest isn't &quot;mini games&quot;, it's secondary systems that do mix with the game. If you want to put everything else other than raid as a mini-game, you'll get it in all games (dailies are mini games, reputation grind is a mini game since you get it and it's done, you won't use it again later or next content, etc.). Also using the community as a selling point... that's old already. Toxic people are everywhere. It's according to the size of your game, but the toxic ratio is always there.<br />
<br />
Your whole response is incoherent, at best. I like both and for different reasons. Every game has its fair share of problems, including WoW. I listed 3 of my problems with ESO and you didn't cite which one you're referring to as 'the worst problem ever'. <br />
<br />
I assume that you (like most people negatively judging ESO) only played in beta - when a game isn't even finished. And yes, WoW is all about endgame (specifically raiding) nowadays, which is one of the issues with it IMHO. If ESO didn't have their raiding (adventure zones) I would still sub because there are tons of awesome things you can do. <br />
<br />
Let me put it this way... If WoW didn't have raiding, but had everything else in the game still, would you still pay a sub for WoW? Most people would say 'No' to that, myself included. That's a big problem and WoW wasn't always like that. It used to have a fantastic community (before Dungeon Finder), adventure (before World of Instancecraft), amazing PvP (TMvSS and old AV), unique classes that filled niches, and a certain character &amp; charm the game has sacrificed for convenience factors. <br />
<br />
The difference between ESO and WoW is that ESO does everything good, and WoW does one thing great (Raiding). The awesome thing for us ESO players is those good things keep getting better and have the potential to become great . Remember, raiding in WoW wasn't great until years into the game...<br />
<br />
WoW has the most boring questing of any MMO I've played. Most people who still play loathe questing and leveling so much, I'm shocked Blizzard hasn't gotten rid of it... well I guess they kind of have (paid boosts to 90 are lolz). On the other hand, ESO has better questing than any MMO I've ever played - even better than Skyrim's (shockingly). The biggest problem is the VRs which they are getting rid of next month (finally!) and replacing it with the Champion system which is infinitely superior.<br />
<br />
Also, community is huge in MMOs - don't kid yourself - and toxic communities have a huge impact on new players coming into those communities. Some games are far more toxic than others, and WoW is only 2nd to LoL in that category. I can count on one hand the rude people I've ran into in ESO since beta (Yes, I've been playing all the way since back then without a sub lapse). In WoW, I can fill 2 hands (or more) in one LFR run or random BG or even just random interaction.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - There is one reason I still play WoW (raiding) and every reason I still play ESO (everything minus VR).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything in ESO is better other than PvE raiding. <br />
<br />
Unbalanced zergfest PvP? - I've held forts with 7 other people against 40+ enemies. Far more skill-centered than WoW where a 2v1 almost always ends with the 2 players winning, no matter how good or bad they are.<br />
<br />
LOLmode trials? Guessing you mean they're easy? They aren't certainly as difficult as I'd like, but they are on par with Heroic Raiding in WoW difficulty-wise (not Mythics).<br />
<br />
Fake action combat? - Eh, what? It is action combat. If someone steps infront of your spell/ability, they can shield the person behind them. There are no autoattacks. You can tab target, but it doesnt work the same way as it does in WoW.<br />
<br />
Champion System a grind? - I'm OK with Diablos Paragon system (I think most are) so if it ends up being like that it will still be miles better than VRs. However, that isn't even on PTS yet so it's merely speculation at this point in time. At least CS has interesting choices, unlike VR which are just kind of there.<br />
<br />
Did you even play past 50 or even past the first 4 VR? The game isn't even close to unfinished or substandard unless you're a lifeless gamer that sits and plays MMOs 10+ hours a day - only then would you have seen all the content. Those same people gt bored with WoW too, I might add.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more solo friendly than WoW, and more difficult to group in currently (if you don't have a guild that is). Their version of LFG is a bit clunky, but it does work, although times can be erratic. I've waited as little as 30 seconds for groups, and as long as 2 hours - depends on the popularity of a dungeon. However, because of that, people are far less inclined to vote-kick people and people are generally pretty helpful like old school WoW. Often times, you're better off using trade chat in a city to find a group (again, like old school WoW). The dungeons are infinitely better than WoW, I might add.</div></div><hr />

Alright ill clarify so as to sound not so trolly. PvP i played DC, we never won. It felt like wherever i looked in the open if i was not defending a fort i was dead by 5 AD players. Trials I would say are normal mode difficulty, maybe heroic with an average group, for me thats to easy, for others thats fine. The action combat system i hate, i like the blocking, but I felt like I was playing a ret pally just spamming buttons. Tab targeting always got on my nerves, and the random target drops and line of sight issues were annoying. Healing was also a huge pain in the ass. Champion system is something hailed as a second coming, but will have to be revamped too to prevent a huge barrier to new players vs those who spent the time grinding 1200 CP. <br />
<br />
The games motto should have been &quot;we know its broken but we're fixing it&quot; I felt like i was playing a paid beta (looks like I was right there) and hated hoping that the next update would fix balance or pvp. Its better now than when I quit, but it is a very casual MMO with a lot of issues, and I enjoy playing more than a few hours a week and look for challenges in games. Yes a lot of that is personal preference, and I will not deny that WoW is sorely lacking content for the casual player atm, but I decided that I was sick of paying for an unfinished game and would wait until it was finished.</div></div><hr />

I know plenty of Arcane mages and they say they are quite happy with how they are playing. If you are talking about PvP I believe arcane is at its best point it has ever been I. The way of PvP. I don't know how you play, but I do believe you need to learn about mages more, they always go through these stages.<br />
<br />
Fire is usually near bottom at the a start of an expac because they NEED crit and its hard to come by early, but blizz has fixed that quite well I find by giving our passives that increase crit buffs. I love my fire mage right now, if you think they still need a buff, start doing some real PvE in Heroic/mythic content. If your a PvPer just be patient till you get the gear you need, then you will be strong enough in that sense.<br />
<br />
If neither of those work, I suggest playing an easier class.<br />
<br />
I am talking about PvP, and how is arcane in one of its best states? Arcane has like 0 crowd control, you can't simply get away from any melee class, also your only offensive cooldown is dispellable. About fire, no i currently have 48% crit chance w/o even 1/2 of epic gear, it's just the fact that fire dmg comes from pretty much only blast wave and pyroblast. Scorch does like under 2k dmg, inferno blast does like 14k dmg, fireball does somewhere near 15k crits. Even pyroblast does no more than 25-30k crits which is just terrible.<br />
Arcane is like a retard in a wheelchair against any melee, fire has like semi good burst for about 40-50% of a player hp(If everything crits), and after that you do absolutely nothing for quite some time, other than 20k crit pyros on the move if you get lucky with scorch.<br />

Seems you are playing a different MMO then the rest of us if you think WW monk and arcane mage are part of the worst.<br />
Yea, coz im talking about PvP, not PvE. And thats exactly why mage is so awful in pvp, coz the PvE nerfs are affecting the PvP.<br />
Simply, because PvP is also about survival, while in PvE you can just dodge the mechanics, stay on one place and DPS freely.</div></div><hr />

I love how you're bragging that you &quot;called it&quot; when eso isn't even f2p. Get some reading comprehension.<br />

<br />
I'm pretty hyped about the upcoming changes. I wonder if they'll truly be drastic changes or not. (Hopefully in a good way)<br />
<br />
Other than that: Why on earth did MMOC/Curse make frontpage news about ESO? MMO-Champion is a WoW (Blizzard-games) news website as far as I've been aware for the past several years and according to MMOC itself. I'm bothered with it because specifically publishing an article about ESO (or any other game) cancelling subs is what causes flamewar-threads and posts on here. They know the whole ''Blizzard should (not) go F2P''-discussion causes !@#$loads of drama. I'm not even mixing myself into that discussion, as I want to avoid drama, but it's like MMOC actually wants to create drama this time. (Otherwise MMOC would post news like this about other games more often.)<br />
<br />
I am mindblown.<br />
<br />
I'm more shocked at the amount of posters here who are insanely ignorant and don't know the difference between f2p and b2p. Like that jackass that didn't know the difference between jealousy and envy last week.</div></div><hr />

Arcane has like 0 crowd control, you can't simply get away from any melee class, also your only offensive cooldown is dispellable. About fire, no i currently have 48% crit chance w/o even 1/2 of epic gear, it's just the fact that fire dmg comes from pretty much only blast wave and pyroblast. Scorch does like under 2k dmg, inferno blast does like 14k dmg, fireball does somewhere near 15k crits. Even pyroblast does no more than 25-30k crits which is just terrible.<br />
Arcane is like a retard in a wheelchair against any melee, fire has like semi good burst for about 40-50% of a player hp(If everything crits), and after that you do absolutely nothing for quite some time, other than 20k crit pyros on the move if you get lucky with scorch.<br />

<br />
Yea, coz im talking about PvP, not PvE. And thats exactly why mage is so awful in pvp, coz the PvE nerfs are affecting the PvP.<br />
Simply, because PvP is also about survival, while in PvE you can just dodge the mechanics, stay on one place and DPS freely.<br />
<br />
Agreed, it must take a special kind of delusional to think fire or arcane are anything like being &quot;good&quot; in PVP at the moment. <br />
<br />
As for PVE rankings, yes arcane is good, but I don't know why people point to a position, when the discrepancy between first, middle and last can actually be quite significant. So it isn't a matter of who's first or last but the differential between them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the game is good especially the variety of builds , tried it on launch and never payed for sub because i'm more connected to WoW so since its f2p now its great to introduce my friends to it and play it sometimes .. you should try it , its actually good many of its aspects we saw it on WoD garrisons like mining without a profession or using every crafting profession but in the garrison its limited and I hope blizzard revamp the professions to follow eso approach in the future .</div></div><hr />

I am so sick of post like this, unless you have seen the ingame playerbase, you have no idea, wildly accusing it of being a ded gaem, is nonsense,do I play it? No, but I did sub back in november and saw quite a few people, same with games like Wildstar and/or RIFT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hardkorr</div><div class="date">2015-01-22, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright ill clarify so as to sound not so trolly. PvP i played DC, we never won. It felt like wherever i looked in the open if i was not defending a fort i was dead by 5 AD players. Trials I would say are normal mode difficulty, maybe heroic with an average group, for me thats to easy, for others thats fine. The action combat system i hate, i like the blocking, but I felt like I was playing a ret pally just spamming buttons. Tab targeting always got on my nerves, and the random target drops and line of sight issues were annoying. Healing was also a huge pain in the ass. Champion system is something hailed as a second coming, but will have to be revamped too to prevent a huge barrier to new players vs those who spent the time grinding 1200 CP. <br />
<br />
The games motto should have been &quot;we know its broken but we're fixing it&quot; I felt like i was playing a paid beta (looks like I was right there) and hated hoping that the next update would fix balance or pvp. Its better now than when I quit, but it is a very casual MMO with a lot of issues, and I enjoy playing more than a few hours a week and look for challenges in games. Yes a lot of that is personal preference, and I will not deny that WoW is sorely lacking content for the casual player atm, but I decided that I was sick of paying for an unfinished game and would wait until it was finished.<br />
<br />
I'll only comment on the things that I know.<br />
<br />
On PvP as DC: Well there are a lot of things you can do. DC specifically has the Chillrend campaign on lockdown (usually owns all the keeps which gives nice buffs for pve is set to home campaign) and a lot of DC PvP guilds started from there (That's where I joined mine). PvP is also a group activity, so you roll with a few homies to do small skirmish pvp (Which I love) or have your allies take the damage while you use siege weapons as support. Or just get super tanky and ignore the 8 other dudes trying to wail on you. Or play like a rogue and stealth past them. Or play like a warrior and take a few down with you before you die. Or play like a mage and do lots of AoE dmg. Or take the time to really plan out your build/skills so that it won't be an issue anymore. I used to die a lot in pvp too (especially to AoE) until I made my two skill bars specifically for common pvp encounters and now it is stupid fun.<br />
<br />
The combat system: It isn't as reactive as WoW's, but that's because it isn't client-based like WoW's . It was made this way to prevent botting, which didn't really stop bots early on. But then again, ESO isn't plagued with bots in PvP. Also, to really get into the combat, you'll need to learn advanced techniques such as spellweaving and blockcasting. If you're just spamming buttons, then you're likely doing zerg pvp, healing, or farming. Otherwise, most fights like small scale pvp or pve take so long that it requires you to manage your resources and have environmental awareness or else you'll be oom and then die.<br />
<br />
Tab-targeting: It's wonky and pointless to use unless you're on TS and someone is shotcalling. Even then, simply looking at a mob is usually the best thing to do. Try not to use it at all and you'll find that combat is more fluid. <br />
<br />
Champion system: To me, it seems like it's not that big of a deal. I PvP, so with the stat caps on I doubt it'll have much of an impact there. And for PvE, you seem to get more buffs by just having an emperor on your side for a home campaign. The only thing's really cool about it are the big skill changing stuff which is really situational like gathering resources faster, small shield when rezzed, don't use mount stamina when sprinting outta combat, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, if you really wanna get back into the PvP scene, lemme know. I'll help you, brosef :D</div></div><hr />

I can see this being really good for ESO... WoW is hemorrhaging subs due to its complete lack of content. Why pay $15 a month when you can buy ESO for $30 and play for free... experience an entire fresh world, lore, quests, classes, gameplay?<br />
<br />
Or sit in your Garrison and click a few buttons every 2-4 hours.... lol</div></div><hr />

They are not going F2P yet. It is a buy to play! You still have to buy a copy of the game. That is not F2P!<br />

A year or two ago I said to myself that ESO and Wildstar would prove once and for all whether sub-based models are viable outside of WoW.<br />

With the terrible quality of ESO, it proved nothing. Had they brought in a ESO that is of Skyrim quality, it would have been a different story!<br />

But then I saw the premium membership. I can understand faster leveling, but more gold? Wouldn't that impact not only the in-game economy, but also allow people to purchase items that could seem advantageous? I was also unaware that there was DLC being released that needed to be purchased, alongside initial purchase and subscription and in-game shop. <br />

Oh, but I agree with you. Rather, what I find amazing are people who actually believed the sub model would work in the first place.<br />
It's a bit of a &quot;mommy, I want to play with big boys&quot; thingy. Pay-to-play is a dying breed, and to make it work, you need to be damn good. Which Bethesda is not MMO-wise (though they make amazing single-player games).</div></div><hr />
