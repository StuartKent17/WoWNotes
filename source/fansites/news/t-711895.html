Now, the fun part. There was a giant version of the Alextrasza vs. Deathwing artwork (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/mount-hyjal-in-defense-of-nordrassil/) released last week and it looks like it was originally cropped. The full version is below and shows the human form of Alextrasza ... and possibly the human form of Deathwing for the first time. <br />

Lich King (25) Heroic US First Kill by Premonition<br />
Premonition (http://premoguild.com/forums/portal.php) (US-Sen'jin) killed the Lich King in 25-Man Heroic mode a few hours ago. Congratulations to them!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/april/premolk_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/april/premolk.jpg)<br />
<br />
From Premonition (http://premoguild.com/forums/portal.php)<br />
So, at long last, we have slain the dragon. First off, big grats to Paragon for getting it done years ahead of everyone else. We should have had a kill a few weeks ago, with a few situations like the following screenshot depicts: sub 20% wipe on our first or second attempt of the week/night (http://www.premoguild.com/images/killshots/lk25hm38a13.jpg), and then nothing but wipes getting worse thereafter!<br />
<br />
To further complicate things, it's no secret we lost a lot of long term members in the Icecrown progression cycle, which massively hamstrung us. So when it came down to Lich King, we ended up having to rely on a very strict set of players, and if they couldn't be on or if their internet was bad, we couldn't raid. It got to the point, actually, where we got one hour of raiding when we started raid, then had to call raid for several hours while a certain paladin's internet stopped chain d/c'ing him, and that was how we raided for the past week (a couple hours in the AM).<br />
<br />
As for the boss itself, it's of course very challenging. We would've loved to be able to have more opportunity to try it at the 5% level, but alas. A few aspects of the fight made us want to smash our keyboards in to the wall now and then, namely all of your priests getting picked up by the Val'kyrs at the same time, and so on!<br />
<br />
We're happy to have come through and end up with a US first, even if it wasn't a typical world rank for a US first kill, after the hardship that we had to work through. Congratulations to everyone and all of the other guilds that have come this far.<br />

Haste and DoTs/Channeled Spells in Cataclysm<br />
We don't think slight variation on hot durations will mess anyone up. Slight variation on dot durations might mess you up a little bit (in terms of having a very predictable rotation), but since you can just refresh those spells without clipping, that seems okay too. Meanwhile, we think there is benefit in the damage per tick not changing.<br />
<br />
Channeled spells are a little trickier to solve. While they technically work like dots, they feel more like nukes to players using them, so changing the duration may feel awkward on those. You may not care about a slight duration change on say Blizzard but you might on Mind Flay when you want to go directly from a channel to another spell. We may end up letting channeled spells just cast faster and finish sooner. We don't want to lower the durations continually with increased haste on hots and dots because it can turn into a real dps or hps loss depending on the situation. Try the Glyph of Rapid Rejuv. It can be useful on some fights but a real pain on others. Tight dps rotations could likewise get screwed up by dots with short durations.<br />
<br />
[...] We might lower the cooldown on some of those spells. Alternatively a spell like http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Wild Growth could stand to have its cooldown raised. The idea of having a single use on some of those spells might work too.<br />
<br />
[...] Sorry, I meant that some of those spells have cooldowns equal to their durations to prevent you from blanketing the room with them. You essentially get one at a time. That might become a problem if haste shortened the duration to the point where you had dead time before the cooldown. We don't want to reduce cooldowns with haste though. That is potentially too powerful in a lot of situations. So one answer is that every time you cast one of those spells, it removes the previous version. Thus you still get one.

Tanking dungeons in Cataclysm<br />
I feel like you're setting up a situation in which the only acceptable answer is &quot;No cooldown on Thunder Clap.&quot; If you just dismiss all your other tools as unreliable or not perfectly suited for the situation, then yeah, you're going to end up in a place where you are waiting 6 long sec for Thunder Clap to come off cooldown.<br />
<br />
I used Intimidating Shout a lot tanking heroic Shattered Halls on my warrior. If you took it off your bar, I'm not sure how you got through that dungeon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />
<br />
[...] Honestly though, I suspect you're unlikely to see anything like the trash before the second boss of heroic Shadow Labyrinth again. I don't want to speak for the encounter designers, but the kind of model we talk about a lot is something like heroic Pit of Saron when you're in appropriate gear. Many of us overgear it these days, but if you don't you'll find some of those pulls particularly near the end can be scary. Maybe it'll be slightly tougher than that, but the point is we don't want to go back to two dozen pulls in between bosses. We'll also be sure to keep some &quot;burn the lot of 'em down&quot; moments, because variety in encounters is good for pacing.

<br />
Think he is referring to his &quot;prestor&quot; form from &quot;day of the dragon&quot; where he is basically a black haired and bearded version of Prince charming to the point where even terenas lets himself be manipulating into letting his daughter getting engaged to Deathwing, not to mention hand over the area of Alterac to him.<br />
<br />
While his new form looks very very cool, i hope we get to see his &quot;manipulator&quot; form also, would be a cool moment for cataclysm when you find out that the guy who has been helping you all along and whom you have been working with all along, was in truth deathwing himself. Even though having him play the &quot;bond villain&quot; act would also work.</div></div><hr />

Sheesh, they are gonna rework paladins again, downtuning of pala AoE tools, having a different rotation for single target and AoE tanking. That's what I want to read about, not silly warrior crybabies!</div></div><hr />

And the difficulty is increased again if the adds come mid-way through the fight. If Thunder Clap is on cooldown then we have no realistic way of picking them up immediately, and by then the mobs are hitting the healer and it makes you look the fool. Even if Thunder Clap is avaliable, you still have to position yourself in such a way that it hits every single mob that has entered the fight. An ability such as Avengers Shield can be used for intial threat on more than one mob, which is what Warriors are lacking in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Again: it's not sustained AoE threat thats the problem.</div></div><hr />

Wheeeeeh =( I loved that thrash tbh! It was a challenge no matter what gear you had (just a bit easier with good gear) <br />
Imho there should be more challenging content in the game to distinguish the 'boys' from the 'men' in this game. Wiping on thash should be part of that. It doesn't even have to involve rewards, could be optional stuph in heroics or smt with uberhard trashpacks etc!<br />

I'm pretty sure it says &quot;Play-doll of the old gods&quot; just makes more sense to me. :P<br />

But grats to premo for the US 1st, also looking even more forward to cata, Deathwing humanform looks damn badass!</div></div><hr />

Ye maybe :P<br />
<br />
Blizzard did say that his armor was made out of iron during blizzcon 2009 and not adamantium (maybe they changed their minds or just misspoke)<br />
<br />
Really hope that his armor will be in adamantium tho, using iron to keep his body together is just plain fail imo :D</div></div><hr />

&quot;Play-doh of the old gods!&quot;<br />
<br />
Woot more old god stuff in cata?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be seeing a LOT of Old God/Titan lore next expansion. Probably double what was in WoTLK and maybe even a tiny bit more than deathwing himself (though I'm sure it will be about 50/50).<br />
<br />
The Old Gods are directly tied to all of the Elemental Lords and sure enough we will be fighting most of them, ie. Al'Akir in the Skywall, Neptulon in the Abyssal Maw, Ragnaros in the Firelands, and possibly Therazane in Deepholme (i say possibly for Therazane because she has not been hinted at as of yet). Plus, Blizz has mentioned that the Old Gods have been &quot;whispering&quot; in Deathwing's ear while he has been licking his wounds and preparing for his return. Really, when you look at a great deal of the villains we have faced up till now, let alone a great deal of the lore surrounding the Sundering, Elemental War, the Aspects, and the Titans, you will see that the Old Gods are pretty much our #1 adversaries overall. More powerful, more terrifying, and more devastating than Deathwing/Arthas/etc combined. <br />
<br />
Still very interested to see if in the end Sargeras is simply yet another one of their pawns or if he infact may be their mastermind and our final foe. Time will tell!<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Grats to Premonition AND Archmage Vargoth. Nice to see he is still around and helping out so long after his expansion!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answer: There's nothing wrong with it. There are as many or MORE warriors tanking everything in the game. I'm not sure what people's problem is.<br />
<br />
The real problem is that there IS something wrong with Paladin tanking. Obviously too easy.</div></div><hr />

Kudos to the art department at Blizzard....now if we could just get that same effort put into the weapons that will drop off Deathwing....*cough*<br />
<br />
I'm already seeing the final battle starting off with DW in his human form before some utterly cool and awesome transformation into a dragon.<br />

Lord Daval Prestor looked pretty normal despite the fact that he WAS the same dragon in the picture.<br />
We can't really compare due to not seeing the other aspects in a humanoid form anywhere near the same comparative level of strength.</div></div><hr />

That. I only care about Premonition, and bath in pictures of their first kills every morning. Of course, that's before I shower with various Ensidia officers. <br />
<br />
Now, seriously, it's pretty hard to find a picture for TW/KR kills and if I remember correctly, both kills would have forced me to push down important Cataclysm information and that's something I don't do easily. The average reader rarely goes below the first news post and important stuff has to stay on top for a while, that's how it always worked on MMO-Champ. <br />

Liking the pictures, although Deathwing has changed somewhat from what he was in what, WoW beta... before he was replaced by a certain female. Doubt he'll use the human form much, can't say he'll be able to &quot;infiltrate&quot; like he used too... <br />

I'm sure there will be some kind of legendary associated with Deathwing, whether he drops it or it's from a quest. It may not be a weapon that previously existed in lore, but then, neither was Shadowmourne.</div></div><hr />

Looks more like an excuse to why they weren't able to get within top 5.<br />
<br />
Claiming HK lich is 'only more hp' or claiming it didn't require 0 mistake, backing it up with the fact that they had members down and mentioning the extra 5% buff on the same post. <br />
I mean come on, the buff provides room for error. A top guild like them should know, no wait, knows that.<br />

WoW is still the biggest mmo franchise atm, and it needs to be brought on pair with other modern games graphic.<br />
It`s suchs a waste that they have acummulated the best conceptual designers in the world, but their art have to be dumbed down to sub kilo polygon models. <br />
It must be very unsatisfying for handpicked top artists to do stuff like; http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/community/conceptart/?ip=warcraft#12 or ; http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/community/conceptart/?ip=warcraft#135</div></div><hr />

<br />
And we have another guy with MORE lava in his veins... ashen skin, fiery eyes and a mouth-guard...<br />
<br />
I'm sensing a little redundancy here :P<br />
<br />
Other than that, the &quot;human&quot; Deathwing looks cool. I guess that answers the question of &quot;how will we fight Deathwing if we're all just ants compared to his dragonishness?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Also gz on the U.S first kill,even though I was cringing while reading there excuses for finishing outside the top 7,all guilds have problems and yours cant have been that great if you still got the first U.S kill,less of the excuses it makes you look realy lame (didnt wanna make this into an attack its just how i read the post) anyway again gz on the kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not anywhere near as much QQ and Excuses Ensidia came up with.<br />
<br />
On topic, big Gratz on US first kill...also, the only warriors who complain saying we need better AoE tanking abilities are the bad ones. Sure it's a little tougher on a Warrior compared to a Paladin/Bear but to say it's &quot;hard&quot; is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arguably looks like a staff, if it ends up being a mace I hope it has some &quot;mega&quot; fiery enchant with hot coals spitting off of it and smoke coming from the edges :P. I don't even know if I should bother finishing my Deathwing human form concept art now though.. <br />
<br />
Anyways, why the hell does that Migol guy get so much attention from the blue posters? Why do they always cater to his QQ of warrior AoE tanking? It's f*cking annoying, and if nobody wants to go on the forums and bitch him out, then that will be the first thing I do when I get a new subscription card after all my final exams are done in T minus 3 days. Check all the latest warrior tank QQing in the last couple weeks, guess who it is every single time? I don't want my class watered down just because some guy a)Refuses to get glyph of cleaving but doesn't want to sacrifice any glyphs for more AoE potential which is not the warrior niche, or b)Is too god damn lazy to tab targets and spread the revenge love, or c)doesn'tknow how to position enemies and misses with shockwave.<br />

<br />
That's what i thought. Probably is.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's likely concept work for a possibly updated STV. Though that's just my oppinion.<br />
<br />
On another note: @ Drawz. Death is bound to look a bit lava-y and cracked in human form. You could just as easily say they were getting the idea from bolvar's new model. I personally like it.</div></div><hr />

I wish Deathwing didn't take a human form though. When you're a super powerful Dragon, why would you even want to take the form of a lower creature.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normally it would be to disguise - infiltrate - manipulate -EXTERMINATE, but given the form he chose your point is very very valid. I fear that form will just serve to make it easier for the game designers to have him drink tea with everyone and his mother in all of the high level areas like they did with the Lich King. :'(</div></div><hr />

<br />
While his new form looks very very cool, i hope we get to see his &quot;manipulator&quot; form also, would be a cool moment for cataclysm when you find out that the guy who has been helping you all along and whom you have been working with all along, was in truth deathwing himself. Even though having him play the &quot;bond villain&quot; act would also work.<br />

Probably a old god minion much like harold voljaz's type. The Play-doh of the old god leads me to believe it is some sort of by-product of the old gods. Just for agruments sake, il say whenever they converted a titan cretion (earthan, mechagnome ect) into flesh, a shapeless was created from the excess,, not entirly true, but could be a fun theory</div></div><hr />

Imho there should be more challenging content in the game to distinguish the 'boys' from the 'men' in this game. Wiping on thash should be part of that. It doesn't even have to involve rewards, could be optional stuph in heroics or smt with uberhard trashpacks etc!<br />

<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Daval_Prestor<br />
<br />
<br />
Prestor was a tall, slim figure with black hair and clean-shaven hawklike features that were the subject of gossip among the ladies of Terenas' court. He also had a quick mind and a friendly, engaging manner that endeared him to all involved in the Alterac crisis. It was said that he even got a smile out of Genn Greymane, the normally dour king of Gilneas.<br />
<br />
The image posted is most likely Deathwing in a smaller more convenient form, where he's not trying to disguise himself as a human.<br />
<br />
<br />
He looks like a warlock to be honest. <br />
All Aspects are extremely powerful casters. I think Neltharion was number two under Malygos.<br />

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we never see Deathwing in a passive human form like Daval Prestor again. He's been continually going more and more insane and growing in power thanks to the whispers and blessings of the Old Gods while stashed and hiding in Deepholme. Deathwing is quite likely to be one of the most chaotically violent main villains we've had in WoW yet, and the 'humanoid' is probably just reflecting this now. Maybe he can't even get his mind together enough to take on a convincing illusion like Prestor anymore.</div></div><hr />

That's an interesting theory. We haven't heard anything out of Deahwing since the battle of Grim Batrol and he was briefly mentioned in Night of the Dragon where he collected the remainder of Sinestra's eggs.<br />

Even the most difficult trash like the pre-Kalecgos Sunwell trash and the heroic SL/SH trash and the early SSC/TK trash can be eventually beaten by noobs brute forcing them. What makes trash &quot;difficult&quot; is mainly the quantity of those kind of trash and how short their respawn timer is. I, for one, don't want 30+ minute trash clears for a single boss anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In these &quot;Shapeless&quot; picture I can read &quot;play-doh of the old gods&quot; so this might confirm a new old god in Cata :)<br />
<br />
And gz Premo on 1st US kill<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering we are fighting the Elemental Lords (Neptulon, Al'Akir, Ragnaros, and probably Therazana), lieutenants of the Old gods, and that it was mentioned by Blizzard that &quot;sinister whispers sank their claws into his thought&quot; while Deathwing slumbered... yes... there will be LOTS to do with Old Gods.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm is shaping up to be exponentially more impressive than WotLK, and i'm loving every bit of info coming our way. <br />
<br />
On a side note, grats on the faceless-shapeless transition for minions. These have a lot of potential considering they could literally be molded into any kind of soldier. I wonder whats next? The nameless?</div></div><hr />

What I've done with my guild isn't relevant. All of these &quot;OMG WORLD/US/MARS FIRST HK LK&quot; kills using the casual buff is a joke. I'm not saying it's not still difficult, it's just not insertplacehre-first impressive.<br />
<br />
<br />
First is first. Doesn't matter if it happened with a buff or without a buff because no one else did it first. No one cares whether you're impressed by things you can't accomplish, so even commenting about it just makes you seem like a loser.</div></div><hr />

He's been continually going more and more insane and growing in power thanks to the whispers and blessings of the Old Gods while stashed and hiding in Deepholme. Deathwing is quite likely to be one of the most chaotically violent main villains we've had in WoW yet, and the 'humanoid' is probably just reflecting this now. Maybe he can't even get his mind together enough to take on a convincing illusion like Prestor anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if he doesn't want to disguise himself then why even bother to shapeshift to a humanoid form at all instead of staying in his real form where he can crush any creature with the tip of his claw? ???</div></div><hr />

I agree that the it has a STV feeling but areas like desolace will turn into tropic environment, so if all that water will go through those mountains who says it can't become all luscious again. Again only a theory but all those little islands look a lot like thousand needles, and even with all the water in the world I don't see STV getting destroyed into a million island.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I think Deathwing's 'human form' looks rather awesome, but as other people said, its not really useful for blending in.<br />
<br />
The Shapeless are pretty obvious...being related to a new old god/godS. Faceless, Shapeless...ya. Poor C'thun is left without a -less race of minions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heretushi</div><div class="date">2010-04-24, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably because we are all humans and can relate more to a human form? Deep down, I guess seeing a human being all powerful is more &quot;awe inspiring&quot; than having an orc or a tauren. They are already physically more powerful than a &quot;puny&quot; human. Maybe it's more of a gap in power with a dragon taking a human form and still pwning.</div></div><hr />

poseur<br />
show-off, exhibitionist - someone who deliberately behaves in such a way as to attract attention<br />
poseuse - a woman poseur<br />

Actually, according to your quoted definition, they would be a &quot;poseur&quot; not a &quot;poser.&quot; I guess you're not much a &quot;reading comprehender.&quot;</div></div><hr />
