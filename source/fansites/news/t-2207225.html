The new band is finished setting up at the Darkmoon Faire in Patch 7.2.5! Their name? Blight Boar.<br />

Catch Blight Boar here, every hour on the half hour!<br />
Or you could come see a GOOD band! The Blight Boar concert will begin in thirty minutes!<br />
If you're interested in gettin' down, the Blight Boar concert starts in twenty!<br />
Blight Boar is playing their underground show on the east side of the island! Your headliner Blight Boar goes on in ten minutes!<br />
My rockin' and rollin' beauties! You're in the right place to melt your face! Allow me to humbly introduce... Blight Booooar!<br />

I will prove once and for all that only a knight from the grave can rule heavy metal.<br />
Though you fight to stay alive, your bodies freeze and shatter!<br />
Darkness falls across the land, the rocking hour is close at hand!<br />
Grisly ghouls from every tomb are closing in to seal your doom.<br />
Another soul for getting down.<br />
Another soul for my armies!<br />
You have failed Blight Boar, your fans now serve my armies of the dead!<br />

Those now trivially obtainable I don't have an issue with.<br />
They were too random IMO to be really prestigious, more dumb luck.<br />

<br />
Simply because<br />
<br />
a) the Warglaives are distinctly a demon hunter weapon, thematically and<br />
<br />
b) Warglaives as a weapon class have like six models and 30 reskins total, while all other weapon classes have hundreds<br />
<br />
c) Only demon hunters can use Warglaives, so it's not like a huge amount of players will be using them exclusively<br />
<br />
<br />
It's basically a convenient and thematic way to increase the amount of transmogs demon hunters have access to with their iconic weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on what it says any character on your account can get the transmog as long as you've gotten both glaives on a single character on your account. However, only Demon Hunters can use the Warglaive transmog.</div></div><hr />

If you have the achievement associated with having both, yes. That's what the tweet says. The requirement is the achievement. However, from what I can find, you'll need both on the same character to get the achievement.</div></div><hr />

It's not like people who have them are automatically going to use them, they'd be way too common at this point. It's like Bulwark of Azzinoth, Spooky Scythe, Golden Bow of Quel'Thalas, etc. Just let people use the appearances they like. Even (especially) legacy things like corrupted ashbringer or ateish, It's not like we don't already have unobtainable transmog pieces like challenge sets. <br />

The whole special &quot;snowflake&quot; BS went out the window when they gave every spec the exact same weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have been asking for legendary xmog for years....if you really dont understand why people are upset then it seems the problem is with you and not those upset. I would love to be able to use shadowmourne as my transmog for both blood and unholy but they keep saying no...but then DHs get warglaives?how does that make sense...at least my class was out when smourne was an active legendary. Keep in mind, im not upset over it...but using examples. I dont care who can xmog what, but I think it's pretty sad on blizzards part to say no then introduce it for DHs only(not that im upset only DHs can get it, cause it makes sense just that other people cant xmog their legendaries).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormykitten</div><div class="date">2017-04-23, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably, they do it because DH has a very limited pool of glaive mogs and it's a shortcut to use existing models.<br />
<br />
However, I do not get the outrage about legendaries and transmog to this day. Why would you not want to be able to use the skin as a homage of what you once got? Just so that people who got it more recently can't? :P It baffles me to be honest. If anything it makes that item visual seem less legendary because it could only persist that expansion, and is now too weak to be usable. If Legendaries scaled I might have a different opinion.</div></div><hr />

If the warglaives were just an artifact skin no one would have said anything. Rogues got thunderfury, I dont see anyone crying about that? Also remember than DH have like 3 weapon trannsmogs.<br />
Actually FYI Glaives can be xmogged into 1 handed swords or axes so they aren't limited at all by that. <br />
<br />
There's no other way to cut it, how they're implementing what should be a simple fun thing anyone could get is flat out retarded.<br />

To all the people here complaining about DH only getting the Warglaives skin.<br />
<br />
How come you aren't in an uproar that rogues get a Thunderfury skin too? Funny how you scream about this legendary appearance but not the Rogue one since Thunderfury is usable by a lot of classes.<br />
Because they didn't. They got an appearance that is not at all the same, but similar and also not Thunderfury. Not to mention that everyone and their mother has or has had that Inflatable Thunderfury item. Again helps when you know what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />

It's literally a HD upscale of Thunderfury that has been cleaned up. And yet nobody complains. It's hypocrisy at best. &quot;WAAAAH DHS GET GLAIVE SKIN but it's ok for Rogues to get an updated TF skin&quot;. Great logic there. Inflatable Thunderfury is a toy that has a limited duration. This skin is not. Helps to know what you are talking about as well. :)<br />
<br />
But I can't wait to get this skin on my DH. Been hoping for a warglaive skin for them since it makes perfect sense with Illidan and all. Hoping for an Ulduar or Sunwell Timewalking in the future so my Shaman can get Val'anyr and hunter Thoridal.</div></div><hr />

I'm correct and you're not. It was never a matter of you agreeing. And FYI I wasn't saying that an xmog appearance and a limited duration item are equivalent, the point is that everyone can get it. They also made it something you can buy a ton of during the pre-xpac event. And no matter how you cut it the rogue artifact appearance is not thunderfury. It's similar, but it's just plain not thunderfury. <br />
<br />
You understand when something is not something it is not something, right? Okay then. Good talk.<br />
<br />
No one would care at all if they made all of things available as xmogs to everyone. Except some Blizzard Devs that can't think past their nose apparently and some idiotic trolls on MMO champion. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

It's a hd reskin of Thunderfury and I didn't see anyone losing their marbles over it. But if you want to argue with &quot;I'm correct you're wrong and there is nothing you can say&quot; then you have already lost the argument because you are not willing to debate and I see no point in continuing with you.

We rogues didn't get thunderfury. We got a completely redesigned version that looks nothing like the original. Just like reclaimed ashkandi. Not near as cool.</div></div><hr />

It's still heavily inspired by Thunderfury and mentions it as a secret of Thunderfury. It's essentially a Thunderfury skin.<br />

Takralus - Our current way of thinking is still that legendaries are and probably should remain to be rarely seen. When you do see one, you instantly recognise it for what it is, and acknowledge the prestige that goes along with owning one.<br />
Then DH get glaives, Rogues get a thunderfury skin, they reuse sulfuras. But still can't mog my real legendaries... So Dumb.</div></div><hr />

Respectable. I'd probably be the same. I mean, I like the Warglaive design, but I'm pretty OCD about old models. If the transmog Warglaives were a HD update, I'd probably use them as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There will only be about 2 classes that can even xmog to the appearance until the end of the xpac, and even then who knows with weapon choices in the future. As it stands, only Fury Warriors and both specs for DH's will be able to have these on 100%. Some could use 1 on an xmog, but thats probably just going to look extremely stupid for most right now.</div></div><hr />

All it is is a HD Thunderfury. In my opinion, it looks far better than the 400x400 texture file lightning rod of a low-res sword that the original was.</div></div><hr />

I mean, since you've decided that you want to be technically correct at the expense of being rationally correct, DHs still can't mog the Warglaives. The appearance is collected from a different source. They still can't mog off the Warglaives themselves.<br />
<br />
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. NOT EVEN REMOTELY THE SAME.<br />
