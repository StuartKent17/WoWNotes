All this is done to keep players, playing longer, paying more $$. Ion's word salad is top notch but we can see right through his bs. Hes slowing the game due to players gearing to fast and burning out too quickly and cancelling subs. These changes are to keep these same quitters, from well, quitting. Keep them grinding to keep them from being bored and they wont get off the gear treadmill!!! Fuck Ion and fuck activision. ruining the best game ever made with bfa cash grabs</div></div><hr />

Ive yet to see you ever come up with anything reasonable. Just word salad, pseudo intellectual drivel. These changes are wrong and only made to increase player time before burning out.

<br />
Yeah? 3-4 percent? Who are they kidding? I am pretty sure I am seeing 40k HP increase for the rares.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are aware and agree that these more challenging mobs at max level that you had an easier time with at lower levels is not a good feeling.&quot;<br />
<br />
This kinda contradicts previous stuff, but... In the end, they do admit it, but again, why, WHY do you keep letting this happen in the first place? Where is the real problem? Too big egos in team leads, unable to see bad ideas/their own faults? Too big corporate greed? What/where is the problem? <br />
<br />
They are letting Azerite gear be tradeable, they removed the war chest requirement from pvp weekly, they are trying to fix the screwed up scaling. <br />
Why all of this even happened in the first place? Most of this was reported in beta. Conclusions... are not nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After playing beta for a month I knew pretty quickly this was the end of the road for me. I enjoy following the forums and seeing what's going on. Maybe if the game changes for the next xpac i'd consider playing again. The AP/Azerite grind they started last expansion was/is dogshit. I'm all for grinding (I played everquest for many years) but grinding that just gets stripped at the end of an xpac makes the game feel really unrewarding and cheap.</div></div><hr />

Yeah guys! He has a Ph.D. in MMO Game Design and spent at least 20 years in college earning it! He's a PROFESSIONAL people! That means he's the defacto expert on all matters relating to the game, and anything he comes up with is beyond reproach! You guys are just dumb stupidheads who don't know anything about game design or the game itself! So just shut the fuck up like Schwarzkopf wants you to! You don't deserve to talk, because you're not PROFESSIONAL game designers! I mean, sure, all it takes is applying and getting accepted to work there, not any kind of degree or specialized training or anything, but that doesn't matter to Schwarzkopf and the other people who are truly whining like he is! PROFESSIONAL = EXPERT IN ALL WAYS and anyone who isn't a PROFESSIONAL is dumb and needs to GFTO! Yeah!<br />
<br />
What do you mean you've spent ~14 years playing the game and know it in and out? PFFT, you didn't design it, so you don't know jack! STFU! <br />
<br />
I mean, it's so true, too. When you get sick, only your parents know how to fix you because they created you; fuck those doctors and other medical professionals. If you want to know how to drive a car really well through messed up terain, ask the engineer who designed the body frame, not a rally race driver. etc. If you didn't build it, you don't know shit people, so again, STFU!<br />

You realize how MMO's work right? Outside of cosmetic items, almost all progression is stripped away at the end of every MMO expansion. It's literally why the game is called a gear treadmill. You replaced legendaries with greens, remember how long it took to get that legendary? MMO's are grinds that rinse and repeat forever.</div></div><hr />

Yeah their design philosophy is all over the place.<br />
<br />
They gut class design so they can &quot;add things on&quot; <br />
<br />
but with leveling/system design they make those add ons meaningless after the expansion is done.<br />

All those mythic dungeon runs and old raids for AP and countless world quests and it just gets poured into a NPC for a cinematic to destroy a sword i mean....</div></div><hr />

Well he's right, no one on forums today ever can control their hate / emotions when it comes to their writing. And only 1% out of 1000 situations i find someone, while also complaining. Actually post constructive and stay constructive.<br />

Outdoor world scaling has not changed since 7.2. Blizzard has not changed anything. Argus had the same system.<br />

This is 318 individual cosmetic rewards that can drop from each completion. I have personally filled my azerite bar and then some for 2 weeks now and not seen my or either of my two friends get a single piece of any of this loot. At 318 pieces, we should be getting a guarantee of 1 item at least per win, maybe even loss. Rare drop rates for the mounts would be acceptable.

That alone ment you were nearly guaranteed to have a better than average weapon for your level even if you just came fresh out of leveling. In BFA if you are having bad luck you could hit 120 with a green weapon thats like 266 ilevel. The jump in mob HP is a much harsher impact when weapon quality is WAY more variable this time around.</div></div><hr />

It was a thing in legion. Removing cloaks or wrists made mobs weaker as your average ilvl suffered, but meanwhile statbudget did not suffer so much. Mobs are way weaker for me now, than it was 40ilvl ago, so... I have no reason to think that something has changed.</div></div><hr />

Of course they were, at this point in Legion you were pretty lucky to have legend yet, By argus most people had 2. It was later in the xpac than it is now. Better trinkets, set bonuses. Most people now probably dont even have that 2nd ring open.</div></div><hr />

people deposit stuff in single stacks cause the ratio of profit to deposit cost is the lowest, meaning you make the most profit.<br />

The team felt that the auto accept and group finder add ons were turning into a button to auto complete world quests.<br />
Well the team is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
They want us to actually socialize and group with players to work together instead of just pushing a button and using each other.<br />
Stop trying to make fetch happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Automating the process makes world quests essentially just traveling around the map and pressing a button. This is not a fun experience.<br />
Not how it worked and stop trying to tell people what is fun and what isn't. Let the community TELL you this.<br />
<br />
<br />
The trade off of having auto accept would be making world quests objectives take longer to offset the ease of the automated process and that isn't fun either.<br />
Or you just leave something that isn't borken alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
World quests are balanced around many different play styles including solo players who don't group often.<br />

Mobs barely gain any health. It's easy testable by vendoring gear and seeing how mob HP changes. They go from ~47k as a fresh 120 to about 50k in 340 gear. The damage you gain from upgrades easily trumps that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WQGF? It should have been broken long time ago, so players could see world quests for what they really are - same old dailies. But instead it got to point that add-on became almost mandatory. Now when its taken away its hard to return to old ways, so players are disappointed.<br />
<br />
Auction house lag? It has been there for years. But developers don't play their own game, so they wouldn't know about it. They only noticed it when it got so bad that some players are on verge of quitting.<br />
<br />
If developers played their own game, they would have noticed those things earlier.<br />
<br />
Then lots of new bullshit that shows how out of touch with game developers are. They are not playing game, they are only there to make money.

If your class is in a good position and is performing really well, itll be one of the few to actually see a difference. Its all about how well your class can scale. Most aren't scaling that well. Thus, most people are not seeing a decrease in kill time.<br />

Because for raids class mix matters, fights matter, mechanics matter and familiarity with the raid matters. You don't get the best read on any of that in beta versus watching the entire game once raids open. That's why their target is the end of the first week of raiding.<br />
<br />
About classes being broken: You can find plenty of posts around for every class in the game saying they are broken. If everyone is broken then it's imaginable that balance is fairly decent. There are also a lot of players who will say their specs are broken if they don't look to be in top five or ten. That's impossible of course. Can't have everyone be in the top 5.</div></div><hr />

Can't have everyone be in the top 5.The difference between what I stated and what you stated is consensus. If there is a consensus among everyone who plays a class, and that consensus consists of a few thousand people, then obviously, that thing is broken. If there are like 50-100 people out of thousands who are just rambling about random stuff being broken, then its probably not broken.<br />
<br />
Don't need everyone in the top five. Just need there to not be a large gap between top and bottom. That is something they don't seem to grasp. If your top dps is at 20k and your bottom is at 4k, then the bottom needs to be brought up. They go and take others down and thus, we get these gaps forming.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it sounds like their issue is they don't invite enough people to test beta and or they don't watch them closely enough to figure out whats wrong.</div></div><hr />

they haven't, you either completely missed what they did pre 8.0 or you don't know what they do now<br />
<br />
pre-8.0, you could roll up into a WQ and the button would pop up asking if you wanted to start or find a group, if you did, you hit a button and it did all the work of finding you a group or creating one. <br />
<br />
it can't do that now<br />

the lack of auto-accept means you gotta click something about 13 times more to create a 5 man group than you did before, and you have to wait for the other person to do the same.<br />

by then, you've spent 3x as long as you used to soloing the quest and the group is pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call bullshit on that one. Doing the same world quest for the 389th time is not a fun experience. No one actually thinks this is true but when your metric for how well the game is doing is average player time spent in game then yeah, it all makes sense.<br />
<br />
World quests are balanced around many different play styles including solo players who don't group often.<br />
<br />
Then you need to tell us which ones are which so we can more accurately know which ones we want to pursue.<br />
<br />
And I feel like they're directly contradicting themselves with these two things:<br />
<br />
Outdoor world mob scaling is done because the world remains relevant and rewards increase as your item level progresses, so the world should keep pace with you but more slowly.<br />
<br />
The team is ok with mythic players graduating out of feeling the need to do world quests for rewards as they outgear it.<br />
<br />

<br />
1) Instead of taking the means away to instant group up, implement some kind of contribution requirement instead.<br />
2) So? <br />
3) People play MMOs for a number of reasons. May it be to progress through PvP, PVE (instances, raids) or to experience leveling and unique quests. Dailies are literally repeating the same exact mundane quests daily or you fall behind on grind necessary to access other portions of the game. I don't understand how you can compare raids and daily quests. People who want to raid, raid. People who don't, don't. But by your logic, players have to raid to access things like and AP. They don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah i feel like with some of the answers they are making fun of us. The answers are just bad, and anyone who played the game can find out counterarguments or better solutions. Like how to encourage people to play with warmode on..are you serious? Most people don't want to deal with PvP when doing WQs, especially without flying and without instant group finder. Why risk doubling the time it takes to complete a boring WQ? I do enjoy warmode once i finish my WQs, i go around on my rogue killing people who are fighting mobs or are badly geared. THIS is the thing, you want people to play with warmode on because they want to PvP, NOT when they want to do their WQs! So just add something like Horde and Alliance champions that spawn randomly on the map and that drop something interesting when killed, alongside the air drops. Encourage PvP for the sake of PvP not to force PvE players into PvPing because they get 50% more AP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I used WQGF for as long as it were functioning, you, a AFK abuser, was something I very rarely encountered while using the addon and I've seen plenty state the same over the last couple of weeks discussion on the topic. I used it on my main and on several alts, so I used it frequently on a daily basis. Most of the time people actually did participated - which speed things up significantly, which is the whole point of the addon - myself included as I am not some freeloader turd. <br />
The occasional time that I did encounter someone like you? The addon itself told me about it, and that prick were gone in no time at all. It was not an issue at all as you were provided with an option to deal with it, if you wished, were you the group leader ofc. Either you cared and kicked the person, or you didn't care and let him/her be, in both scenarios its an nonissue. <br />
Reading your posts here on the subject it does seem to me as if you are unable to look outside of your own bubble, assuming that since you are engaging in a specific behavior that automatically must mean that a lot of others are doing it as well - as if you, yourself, are some sort of golden representative of the norm. Well, if so, you might want to reassess that logic of yours.<br />
<br />
Inflation.... Gold wq's were in no shape or form a significant contributor to some explosion of available gold during Legion, and just to get it out of the way I do not agree with the notion of something like that happening in Legion in the first place - the pile of gold is larger overall but the value of the gold itself hasn't increased, it has decreased over time. (Do all wq's with gold trait x3 boodyguard on several alts, everyday and that would net you a juicy sum. I mean, I did it, but if we are going to be realistic, how many would've done that?!). Bellular did a video quite a while ago, explaining how the inflation in wows economy works.</div></div><hr />

I've never spoken a word to anyone while in a WQ group, and being invited manually doesn't change that one bit. The Group Finder itself is what causes the lack of social interaction, for WQs to be &quot;social&quot; you'd have to remove it altogether.<br />
<br />
Not only that, Ion sat there and told a bold-faced lie. He said the having things like WQGF trivialized doing WQs because combat was over in seconds. I'm not sure where he gets his data from, because stuff doesn't die faster just because you're in a group. Every person that 'tags' the mob, the Hp needed to kill it increases (mob scaling). WQGF and the like, just made doing WQs a little less tedious in making groups, that's all, and now they took that away. I barely bother with WQs now.<br />

<br />
pre-8.0, you could roll up into a WQ and the button would pop up asking if you wanted to start or find a group, if you did, you hit a button and it did all the work of finding you a group or creating one. <br />
<br />
it can't do that now<br />
<br />
the lack of auto-accept means you gotta click something about 13 times more to create a 5 man group than you did before, and you have to wait for the other person to do the same.<br />
<br />
by then, you've spent 3x as long as you used to soloing the quest and the group is pointless.<br />
<br />
I know exactly how things were and how they are now and I have to click 3 things at most with World Quest Tracker. Seriously it took me a whole 10 seconds here to get a group and it auto invites due to how it gets around Blizz's restrictions.<br />

I see, so it requires addons now. Thanks, I was thinking they had backed down and put it back in. It's a terrible change, auto invite was never an instant quest complete button like they're saying, that's nonsense. You still have to do the fights. It just made forming and joining groups more convenient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every. Damned. Time. That's it, I'm making Bingo cards for Ion's Q&amp;As, he's too predictable not to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Automating the process makes world quests essentially just traveling around the map and pressing a button. This is not a fun experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Denial ain't just a river in Egypt. They created content that's pure grind, so players invent way to make it more efficient. &quot;B-but, that's not the fun I demand you should have!&quot; declares Ion Hazzanexcuse, and takes his toys and flounces home.<br />
<br />
I think, and continue to think, Ion is obsessively fixated on micromanaging the player experience, to detriment of the game. He wants to too dictate far too much what &quot;fun&quot; is, instead of taking cues from players, and designing into it. <br />
<br />
The irony is they say these addons aren't social. But they are, because they bring players together, even if briefly, and it's for content players don't like in the first place. Nobody enjoys grinding. So to me, this all smacks of him being irked players don't like what he's decided is fun, and he's going to herd you into what he wants, no matter what. <br />
<br />
MMOs are and should be shaped by the players, along with the dev's visions and ideas, but Ion's team is now consistently anti-player when it comes to how players actually engage with his content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harbour</div><div class="date">2018-08-23, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The team felt that the auto accept and group finder add ons were turning into a button to auto complete world quests.<br />
WQ themselves were designed to be auto completed with one button. It asks for no coordination and almost for no brain activity. For WQs to be engaging they should be the whole Quest lines for people to group up and coordinate their moves.<br />
<br />
<br />
They want us to actually socialize and group with players to work together instead of just pushing a button and using each other.<br />
What i said above. WQ are designed that way. To kill mobs you need to push button. To use some object you need to push button. It doesnt require the players coordination, it works fine and more simple without it. The only thing that requires some brain activity are tortollan mini-games. And they dont require grouping.<br />
<br />
<br />
Automating the process makes world quests essentially just traveling around the map and pressing a button. This is not a fun experience.<br />
WQ is literally traveling around the map and pressing a button. Why Ion tries to replace WQs themselves being the problem with Auto Group Finder being the problem? I know why - because he knows he cant fix WQs.</div></div><hr />

WoW already has the facility and tech, just like when you form a group for LFG and queue, you have your party group and your LFG group. When you leave the LFG (or in this case the WQ area) you simply go back to only being in your party.<br />

You know what i find funny? That people like you exist, that don't care about the direction of the game. If they tripled the HP of every WQ mob you would be fine with it. <br />

Exactly that, why force PvE players into PvP only for increased WQ rewards? Just make it so after you've done your PvE WQs there's a reason to enable warmode. And i'm not talking AP, just gold, transmogs, mounts, pets, honor, conquest points.</div></div><hr />

Serious note: Seek help. people with 10k achievs. probably would be less than 3%, I bet not even that, of playerbase sooo.. if anyone should have that influence it is not you for sure. Just enjoy the game, which is being developed using &quot;casuals&quot; money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am playing a Sub Rogue, and am Level 115, and I have to say the difference from like 113 to 115 in the same zone feels non existent. When I was 113 going after monsters in the same zone I am 115, feels no different, I would like to think I got more powerful, but it doesn't seem like it<br />
<br />
I sort of liked older expansions of having specific levels for each zone in that new continent. Like Outland, we knew Hellfire Pen was the lower level 60 to 62 or so monsters, but that Shadowmoon had the level 68 to 70 bad guys, so if i went back to Hellfire zone at level 68 i was doing way more damage to those Hellfire zone guys, than when i was level 62 in that zone. But today the expansion zones scale along side with you, which I am not really a fan of that idea.</div></div><hr />

No flying, game is too casual, remove LFR and make game vanilla again<br />

Serious note: Seek help. people with 10k achievs. probably would be less than 3%, I bet not even that, of playerbase sooo.. if anyone should have that influence it is not you for sure. Just enjoy the game, which is being developed using &quot;casuals&quot; money.<br />
<br />
So you're a mythic raider. You know what i don't do? Go around mythic raiding posts and comment about how easy or hard or whatever raiding is. Because i'm not a mythic raider. Hell, if they removed mythic raiding it would not impact me whatsoever. But i understand that it would bother a lot of players. <br />
Do i think you should seek help for raiding mythic, enduring through all those hundreds of wipes? Ofc. And i bet more people have 10k WQs completed than have the mythic Argus achievement. <br />
Maybe you should accept the fact that there are people who play differently and who expect the same quality as you expect from the content you enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Stop giving so much atention to the crybabies. Let us have real questions like when we can expect Kul'tirans/Zandalari, when the PTR is gonna come up, etc. I want to know when the content is coming cause this is an awesome expansion so far. <br />

It's not that they can't, it's the fact they know they're gonna be doing it over and over and over and over. Now add in alts. It gets tedious and without something to make it go as quick as possible people get burned out redoing content hundreds of times over years.</div></div><hr />

Uh, no. The WQ gold quests were not fast nor the best. If you had a lot of alts, the table was. I went up 500k in 2 month with just 2 alts fully maxed out getting 4k+ each a day on average from those gold quests. If you had all 12 fully maxed characters bringing in 4k a day you could easily clear <br />
45k a day. I had multiple guild members who went up from a few thousand to Millions, just from those tables. They were insane when each quest could give you 2k-3k a pop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They cannot do it in 10 second, and somehow they think that game when you run around the world and do 10 sec world quests is somehow good game. Also some of them are just min-maxers or &quot;serious&quot; mythic raiders that WANT that part of game to be broken, because they clear whole map twice a day.<br />
<br />
Today I turn on Preach stream. I like him and his shows, but when I saw that he run around the world on THREE characters + whine all the time how world quest are boring and how Blizzard comunication is worse than in WoD (literally on the day of Q&amp;A, which he won't watch - as always - and just mock Ion viewpoint by reading bullet points from MMOChamp/WoWhead)... I was totally disgusted. And later he is surprised that WoW drift more and more from Mythic raiding.<br />
<br />
This word is used too often, but people that WANT IT ALL ASAP are really cancer for this game. I honestly don't know what would be the solution - even if Blizz release Mythic raids like months later, they'll just no-life this game on 6 characters instead of 3.<br />
<br />
And it's sad no one see big picture - in Legion, to get all rewards, you had to do world quests whole expansion - first for legendary chance, then for paragon mounts (I bet overwhelming majority don't have even half of them even today). Now it's for initial gearing and you don't have to do them when you max out reputation. So overall you'll get shorter, but better experience.</div></div><hr />

If you have gone up 40 ilvl and the mobs health increases so they take the same amount of time, if not longer, that is the bullshit. The entire point of gearing up is to make things easier and faster.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is a large company, I'm sure they have room on other projects for him and his team that still don't understand (or care to understand) some of the issues they keep ignoring or just not comprehending. <br />

So personally, I wouldn't feel any love lost if they did move him to another franchise/department.<br />

Find me a job where you don't have to sell your soul to the company to earn the money you need to survive. :p I'll wait. You might find one by the next ice age.<br />

Calling for Ion to lose his job through firing or getting swapped to a different position is nutty and maybe even serves as the peak for the worst bit of the WoW community that seems to be accepted.<br />

I've got my own personal gripes with this expansion and the game in general. Dislike of wPvP handling, rewards for Island Expeditions and some Azerite balance issues to name a few. But you can't say that the quality of the game in general hasn't gone up. Dungeon/Raid content specifically gets better with every expac and is the meat and potatoes of the game so to speak so if the core of the game is getting better every expansion but the sides of the meal aren't really pleasing you don't you think it's silly to throw a fit? It's fine to give criticism but to ask for the chef to be fired because the product isn't perfect is delusional.</div></div><hr />

Except it isn't asking him to be fired and losing his livelihood. If he's keeping his current wage and status within the company just in a different department/franchise how exactly is that him being &quot;fired&quot;? In most (if not all) other jobs if you constantly make unpopular decisions with customers or can't live up to expectations within the company in regards to quality you do tend to either get demoted or actually fired. Now maybe Blizzard is happy with this haphazard mess, just means if there's any fallout, they'll have to deal with it. <br />
<br />
It's actually quite easy to say the game quality is going downhill. They make all the time gating more and more obvious, listen less to feedback in regards to class performance on alpha/beta forums (ele/spriest say hi), think mob filled dungeons are &quot;fun&quot;, etc... Granted they do tend to do some things right, just seems to be fewer and farther apart these days. Also fwiw with your analogy, if the Chef has been making unpopular menu choices and making mistakes for the last 4+ years, it might be time to get a new Chef.</div></div><hr />

Right, except the echo chamber of WoW community forums can't seem to get it through their head that they are NOT the majority and are in fact a vocal minority. The simple fact of the matter is a large majority of the people that play this game, or any game, don't visit forums to voice their opinions and people that usually do only do so to voice discontent. You said it yourself, they do some things right yea? But there's basically never people who make forum threads to gush about how much they love the things they do right but there's always an angry customer making a thread about how unhappy they are.<br />
<br />
MMOChampion and Reddit live in this bubble where they believe the entire playerbase hates 90% of the game because that's all they read about but that's not the case and if it was people would show that with their wallet. They did so with WoD's massive player drop and did it again with Legion/BFA selling great. You wanna know if people are into the game right now? Ignore all the bellyaching on the forums and check out sub numbers and the like. That's the only proof that matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it isn't hard to figure out. He reads the forums, so he knows the discontent of the players.<br />
From there, there are several possibilities, but they all largely end the same way:<br />
<br />
- He hides the discontent from the developers (as it's &quot;non-constructive&quot; or some other BS excuse for &quot;I don't agree&quot;), the players see no improvements, grow more bitter, and are even more vocal about their discontent. An natural &quot;us vs them&quot; attitude happens, and he grows to hate the player base at large. A CM who hates the community he manages cannot possibly be happy. Thus taking questions from said community during a Q&amp;A is not fun.<br />
<br />
- He does not hide the discontent from the developers, but is largely ignored and unable to get answers or solutions from the developers. With nothing to report on the problems of the day, and no solutions forthcoming, it's natural he would feel powerless to represent the players while banging his head against a wall of silence that feels impenetrable. This is soul crushing, and cannot result in happiness. Thus sitting next to the person who ignores you 99% most of the time, and having to select meaningless questions which the devs will actually answer (one that won't create too many new firestorms in the forums) is not fun. <br />
<br />
- He does not hide the discontent from the developers, and the developers tell him they like it and &quot;screw the players&quot;. His job prevents him from passing along along their answers verbatim, and forces him to either craft bull crap excuses or ignore what he knows are legitimate problems exasperating the complaints. In either case, this is a very crappy position to be in, and also cannot result in happiness. Thus, a Q&amp;A which is meaningless and does noting to address player concerns is stressful and also not fun.<br />
<br />
Probably it's some combination of three. When you add to that the daily annoyances from spammers, and all kinds of vile posts imaginable, I really don't envy the CM's jobs.<br />
<br />
Ultimately the blame falls on Ion in any case. Either he's ignorant of the players thoughts and thinks everything is fine (which he doesn't appear to be, but if it's true, he failed to do even rudimentary verification of the feedback he was given), or he knows and is putting the CMs into impossible situations with his continual destruction of the game (aka &quot;savage vision&quot; or whatever other buzzwords they're using for flushing the game down the toilet).</div></div><hr />

Can agree to the first bit. Second bit I always thought MMOC and Reddit were polar opposites. MMOC hates wow, Reddit loves it considering how heavily moderated it is and how criticism posts usually disappeared rather quickly. Then again I haven't been to the Reddit since before the 7.3.5 patch hit live. <br />

Tbh I would love to see the sub numbers however I doubt we ever will since the flying debacle and the switch to reporting &quot;success&quot; in their reports via &quot;MAU(DAU?)&quot; metrics.</div></div><hr />

From there, there are several possibilities, but they all largely end the same way:<br />
<br />
- He hides the discontent from the developers (as it's &quot;non-constructive&quot; or some other BS excuse for &quot;I don't agree&quot;), the players see no improvements, grow more bitter, and are even more vocal about their discontent. An natural &quot;us vs them&quot; attitude happens, and he grows to hate the player base at large. A CM who hates the community he manages cannot possibly be happy. Thus taking questions from said community during a Q&amp;A is not fun.<br />
<br />
- He does not hide the discontent from the developers, but is largely ignored and unable to get answers or solutions from the developers. With nothing to report on the problems of the day, and no solutions forthcoming, it's natural he would feel powerless to represent the players while banging his head against a wall of silence that feels impenetrable. This is soul crushing, and cannot result in happiness. Thus sitting next to the person who ignores you 99% most of the time, and having to select meaningless questions which the devs will actually answer (one that won't create too many new firestorms in the forums) is not fun. <br />
<br />
- He does not hide the discontent from the developers, and the developers tell him they like it and &quot;screw the players&quot;. His job prevents him from passing along along their answers verbatim, and forces him to either craft bull crap excuses or ignore what he knows are legitimate problems exasperating the complaints. In either case, this is a very crappy position to be in, and also cannot result in happiness. Thus, a Q&amp;A which is meaningless and does noting to address player concerns is stressful and also not fun.<br />
<br />
Probably it's some combination of three. When you add to that the daily annoyances from spammers, and all kinds of vile posts imaginable, I really don't envy the CM's jobs.<br />

Well when he's streaming on twitch he seems happy nowadays. And just a month or two ago he basically said on stream that if he could get the sub numbers he would go back to streaming full time. And knowing his history and passion from following him years before blizzard, that was a really telling thing when he said that. Because I know he truly believed he could help make a difference when he left to go work for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

This is annoying me.<br />

It clearly says after dungeon gear. Meaning we won't see the '3-4%' yet. Hes saying when we're item level 400 or 500 or 600 we will definitely feel more powerful.<br />

The WQ gold quests were not fast nor the best. If you had a lot of alts, the table was.

If you had all 12 fully maxed characters bringing in 4k a day you could easily clear <br />
45k a day. I had multiple guild members who went up from a few thousand to Millions, just from those tables. They were insane when each quest could give you 2k-3k a pop.<br />
<br />
and when world quests gave 100-300 and i could do 10 in an hour.<br />
while those missions you sent them out then you just did nothing as they took a day or two to finish.<br />

<br />
1) Instead of taking the means away to instant group up, implement some kind of contribution requirement instead.<br />
2) So? <br />
3) People play MMOs for a number of reasons. May it be to progress through PvP, PVE (instances, raids) or to experience leveling and unique quests. Dailies are literally repeating the same exact mundane quests daily or you fall behind on grind necessary to access other portions of the game. I don't understand how you can compare raids and daily quests. People who want to raid, raid. People who don't, don't. But by your logic, players have to raid to access things like and AP. They don't.<br />
<br />
1. if they add a contribution requirement then just no one will join the groups because then you still have to do the same amount of work, meaning that why even join a group.<br />
2. a game should not complete for you by just afking.<br />
3. we are not even 2 weeks through and I am literally only a day or 2 from being able to drop world quests.<br />

So there is improvement and i can confirm that on many toons i have. The problem is you WISH there would be more and faster improvement, but live is not what you wish for and there is still enough improvement overall. <br />

<br />
It's not that they can't, it's the fact they know they're gonna be doing it over and over and over and over. Now add in alts. It gets tedious and without something to make it go as quick as possible people get burned out redoing content hundreds of times over years.<br />

Again nobody is forcing you to level 10 alts and have every thing to be done every day. Doing things over and over again is the pure nature of MMORPGs and if you get burned out, relax and play something else.<br />

To all those people bitching about people who wanna do their WQs as fast as possible (using addons):<br />
Ofc. you can do them all solo without using any brainpower. But it takes time.

<br />
So don't do it? Or do like 5-10 a night!? You cant tell me you NEEED the last receipt to stay alive or that last 2% in DMG to kill the raidboss or whatever. Killing bosses depends 99% of the time on how to play the mechanics and how good you can play your class. If you match the GS recommendation you should be able to kill that boss/raid.

<br />
There are other ways to handle this they could have done which would be WAY better. For example, let the player decide how they want to do the quest and for what reward (a sort of normal/heroic/mythic) toggle in the UI which would set the mob difficulty and the ilv reward. This way gearing is not completely relegated to uselessness. A toggle for zone scaling would also solve the problems with &quot;what's the point of leveling?&quot; that people are rightfully complaining about. We were not consulted before the change, and alternate ideas were not accepted after - blizzard's way or the highway like usual.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flying unlocking via achievements is more fun than pay x gold, if they added a short story quests directly involving flying it would be even better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please take a moment to realize that there has not been flying in current end game world content since MoP (yes MoP)! It has pretty much been removed. There are so many problems with pathfinder it's difficult to know where to start, but I'll give it a go:<br />
- The 8 month waiting for a later patch nonsense is totally unacceptable. Getting an achievement is not the major issue, the time gating is. There is no possible valid excuse for this. If wpvp is an issue, disable flying in war mode in new content for all I care - let that be the trade off for the higher AP/exp and crate rewards and such.<br />
- The content is exhausted by the time flying becomes available. Is flying supposed to be worthless for our mains (the daily quests we want to fly to get to will have been farmed to death by that point to get the rep we need to get flying thus obsoleting the content)? Are we not supposed to level alts for the first 8-10 months of and expansion?!?<br />
- The requirements for pathfinder are stupid. What are rep grinds in the achievement at all? Give me one reason lore master, explorer, and maybe treasure hunter are not sufficient? Are PvP players not supposed to have flight? Are pet battlers efforts worth nothing? Some selection of activities to suit various play styles is needed. Having a one size PVE task list hurts a lot of players forcing them to do stuff they don't want to do.<br />
- It should not be an achievement that grants flight - it should be an in game quest. Looking at achieves to find out your character can fly is stupid.<br />
- Path finder caused the flight whistle. If you want to port around like a mad man, race change your MoP/WoD challenge mode character mage to dark-iron and pick up engineering! This &quot;everyone porting everywhere all the time&quot; nonsense has to stop!<br />
- Flight paths cost money - no I'm not joking. They basically negate the measly quest reward pittance you're given after repairs. Thus all income for a toon is generated by those insipid lame time gated mission tables. With flying, questing would be little less unrewarding and more outdoor PVE content would be done. The table should be nerfed and quest rewards buffed. If you want cash, get out there and play the damn game - don't buy tok€n$, stop clicking on tables and logging onto alts to click on more tables, and get out there and do some questing dammit!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Progression via time passed and work input makes it good RPG? <br />
<br />
<br />
Please stop thinking you're accomplishing something by being present or doing trivial content. If you want something to brag about there's plenty to do: high rank pvp, mythic raiding, brawlers guild, mage towers, etc. Do any of those and flaunt your rewards.<br />
<br />
Obediently doing blizzard's tasklist of meaningless chores to get back something they steal every xpac is not a meaningful achievement - it's a needless nuisance, and it becomes pointless after an xpac has run its course (there is no reason for players starting now not to straight up buy wod or legion flying rather than grind out time gated reps in outdated content). I for one much prefer grinding rep when I feel like it (usually in the later half of the xpac), for their own sake for little or no reward (some crafting recipe/pet or something), not have to grind them early to get something I need in order to make doing things I would much rather prefer to be doing (gearing, dailies, etc) more fun.</div></div><hr />

And If people where not gaining an expansions worth of power in one raid tier Blizzard wouldnt need to do a item level squish and number squish every other expansion. If everything about the way that Blizzard is doing loot wasnt broken and massively flawed they wouldnt need to try and come up with all these lame systems/mechanics in game to artificially limit player power in different scenarios and over all hurt the player experience. Blizzard adding numerous systems in to the game to try and fix a problem is just making the game more complicated while not actually fixing the problem and its creating new problems!</div></div><hr />

This is really interesting..and worrying!.the cosmetic rewards are the main goal for me but I've not delved into the island expeditions yet. Are they locked behind a certain difficulty/pvp mode I wonder?</div></div><hr />

First of all, the interview was pretty good. All but 2 questions/answers were targeted to real problems and he pretty much went right ahead and adressed them, either with confirming the problem and a proberble solution on the way or answering why things are as they are and why they will not change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc596a18f574</div><div class="date">2018-08-24, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are other ways to handle this they could have done which would be WAY better. For example, let the player decide how they want to do the quest and for what reward (a sort of normal/heroic/mythic) toggle in the UI which would set the mob difficulty and the ilv reward. This way gearing is not completely relegated to uselessness. A toggle for zone scaling would also solve the problems with &quot;what's the point of leveling?&quot; that people are rightfully complaining about. We were not consulted before the change, and alternate ideas were not accepted after - blizzard's way or the highway like usual.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please take a moment to realize that there has not been flying in current end game world content since MoP (yes MoP)! It has pretty much been removed. There are so many problems with pathfinder it's difficult to know where to start, but I'll give it a go:<br />
- The 8 month waiting for a later patch nonsense is totally unacceptable. Getting an achievement is not the major issue, the time gating is. There is no possible valid excuse for this. If wpvp is an issue, disable flying in war mode in new content for all I care - let that be the trade off for the higher AP/exp and crate rewards and such.<br />
- The content is exhausted by the time flying becomes available. Is flying supposed to be worthless for our mains (the daily quests we want to fly to get to will have been farmed to death by that point to get the rep we need to get flying thus obsoleting the content)? Are we not supposed to level alts for the first 8-10 months of and expansion?!?<br />
- The requirements for pathfinder are stupid. What are rep grinds in the achievement at all? Give me one reason lore master, explorer, and maybe treasure hunter are not sufficient? Are PvP players not supposed to have flight? Are pet battlers efforts worth nothing? Some selection of activities to suit various play styles is needed. Having a one size PVE task list hurts a lot of players forcing them to do stuff they don't want to do.<br />
- It should not be an achievement that grants flight - it should be an in game quest. Looking at achieves to find out your character can fly is stupid.<br />
- Path finder caused the flight whistle. If you want to port around like a mad man, race change your MoP/WoD challenge mode character mage to dark-iron and pick up engineering! This &quot;everyone porting everywhere all the time&quot; nonsense has to stop!<br />
- Flight paths cost money - no I'm not joking. They basically negate the measly quest reward pittance you're given after repairs. Thus all income for a toon is generated by those insipid lame time gated mission tables. With flying, questing would be little less unrewarding and more outdoor PVE content would be done. The table should be nerfed and quest rewards buffed. If you want cash, get out there and play the damn game - don't buy tok€n$, stop clicking on tables and logging onto alts to click on more tables, and get out there and do some questing dammit!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please stop thinking you're accomplishing something by being present or doing trivial content. If you want something to brag about there's plenty to do: high rank pvp, mythic raiding, brawlers guild, mage towers, etc. Do any of those and flaunt your rewards.<br />
<br />
Obediently doing blizzard's tasklist of meaningless chores to get back something they steal every xpac is not a meaningful achievement - it's a needless nuisance, and it becomes pointless after an xpac has run its course (there is no reason for players starting now not to straight up buy wod or legion flying rather than grind out time gated reps in outdated content). I for one much prefer grinding rep when I feel like it (usually in the later half of the xpac), for their own sake for little or no reward (some crafting recipe/pet or something), not have to grind them early to get something I need in order to make doing things I would much rather prefer to be doing (gearing, dailies, etc) more fun.<br />
I do agree that flying could be aquired differently and that it should be a reward from a questline.<br />
<br />
Timegating/grind &quot;useless chores... I have been doing it since for ever in any rpg? Rep/time gated raids and dungeons for ever in this game. Nothing has changed and it still is an RPG element. It was really cool to enter arcway in legion for the first time after doing my chores. People caught up later ofc. But it does not affect me anyhow lol. It just felt rewarding to access it at the time and after it become trivial I don't really care if someone can access it without grind. Same as I don't care about people seeing LFR. I was the one who did it when it was cool. <br />
<br />
If I qant different game than you, that does not makes us wrong, it just shows, that well, there will.always be someone upset. That is what you get for having 4milion players lol. Every single player has their own vision for game elements or even lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have gone up 40 ilvl and the mobs health increases so they take the same amount of time, if not longer, that is the bullshit. The entire point of gearing up is to make things easier and faster.<br />
<br />
As Ion said, the mobs health increase, but your dmg increases more. I am a tank on my main, currently 341 and i am killing bosses much after then when i just dinged 120 and did my first round of world quests. Now, most of my bonuses are focused on tanking/survivability, so being a 341 dps should increase the speed of killing even more.<br />
<br />
You are getting stronger, you are having things become easier and faster, you are just not smashing things to the ground. Yet as Ion said, you are also getting better rewards at item lvl 341 than at 289, so it is only fair the fights follows to give you a bigger challenge to match the reward.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ion has to go. This guy is making the same mistakes previous devs made. I want Ghostcrawler back.<br />
<br />
Also, there is a huge disconnect from the game and the player base at this point.<br />
<br />
Ohh hell no. Ion is one of the best things that has happend to this game. His entire point of communicating and actually talking about stuff instead of hiding behind pages of text, is amazing. Compared to so many other dev teams and just project leaders in general, his willingness to meet the community head on like this, is brilliant.</div></div><hr />

No mention at all of the Wanted quests on the horde side not giving rep. It's not like they gated a mythic only dungeon behind rep or anything like that<br />
<br />
Have you unlocked all extra hubs with extra wanted quests? I did not. I can see you did not too. How do you know those quests don't give rep? They said some do, some dont. Until all are done, we can't be sure</div></div><hr />

Ofc. you can do them all solo without using any brainpower. But it takes time. Time is a precious commodity nowadays and I don't want to waste 4-5 hours a night on running around zones, doing the same 20-30 WQs over and over and over and over until I'm finally at a point where I don't need to do them anymore..<br />
<br />
Than you either need to take things slower, accept that you need to spread your game time over longer periods of time, or you simply do not have time to play the game at the level you want.<br />
<br />
It is okay to take decisions on that basis. I myself can't play competative anymore with my Dota group because my time is not there to train for it. Its simply a thing of growing older and having more things compete for your time.<br />
<br />
You are afterall asking the game to cater down to you, have the devs lower the percieve quality of the game in their eyes, just so you can spend less and less time on the upkeep of the game.</div></div><hr />

I avoid it because it has shit gear for the most part for my Rogue. But yeah in terms of trash it's an awful dungeon. <br />

It's MMO-Champion, where people who quite this game for years are whining about current content. Well they say that they quite the game, but I highly doubt it. :D Don't take this forum serious, it's actually a really small percentage of players who are posting, players who like the game don't scream it all over the internet.</div></div><hr />

He spent like 15-20 minutes answering that question in a previous Q&amp;A a couple of months ago, I think everything that needs to be said has been said. At the end of the day, if you don't like it, sucks to be you, suck it up and deal with it or leave for another game if it's that game-breaking, because they consider it to be working as intended.<br />
