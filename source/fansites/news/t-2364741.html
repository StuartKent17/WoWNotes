<br />
Eh I figured it would be around the time they were dropping XP/Vista support. They dropped support in October if I recall.<br />
<br />
This makes just as much sense. I doubt many players are running a 32 bit OS or they wouldn't have done this. Same with the XP/Vista thing.<br />
<br />
Hell the market share for Vista and XP combined now is less than 4%. I somehow doubt there were many players on XP/Vista.<br />

I don't know, but i look at Legion's Dalaran vs Wrath Dalaran and i can see the performance impact but not the improvement...<br />
<br />
The player models do look much better, the new zones look nice but it just doesn't seem proportional to the impact it has on the game's performance.<br />
I don't have the technical knowledge to tell you why, it just looks that way to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meh. OpenGL's been dying a slow, obonoxiously painful death for years. Still would have preferred OpenGL 4.6 + Vulkan to Metal though so more games would direct port to OS X more readily.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well...the requirements keep going up but the graphics don't improve much.<br />
<br />
Not forcing the requirements to go up for so long is why the graphics haven't improved all that much. Making massive updates to the engine is pretty difficult when it has to support tech that MS and Apple itself no longer support. That's what's changing, so going forward you'll start seeing a bit more reward for being current, such as DX12 features being brought in.<br />

Get a new nVidia GPU such as the 1080. It runs Metal just fine and the Mac Pro's limited availability of connectors (2x 6-pin) can power most models of it. Use nVidia web drivers. Problem solved. The 2009 and later Mac Pros can run High Sierra.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should have worded it better.<br />
For instance if i am in a BG such as Arathi Basin, which is a really old one...it doesn't matter if the whole group is fighting at the same flag, the performance drop is minimal, however in Dalaran it doesn't matter how populated it is atm, the loadings are long, the memory usage high and the fps drops so much...even though nothing seems to be happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weekly base:<br />
<br />
if you do everything then you'd get, on average, 313 (old) vs 2091 (new).<br />
Old values would yield about 1.788 legendary a week, new values 2.091 (because of the amount added to daily bg, otherwise 1.881)<br />
<br />
They could have just lowered the 175 a bit to get the same results but I guess, looking at their track record, bigger numbers = better ;(</div></div><hr />

What would be a bit more friendly is to keep the 1000 essences inflation for the legendary generating token item, but keep the 50 essence requirement for the upgrade to iLV 1000 item. That would have at least made it more friendly to upgrade the ones you have already if you have a lot, but make hoarding essences now pointless for the item generating tokens in 7.3.5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no,you are just wrong,what they did was the best solution,some people who had no legendary or had all at 1000 were no longer getting essences,wile others did and could hoard,it would have been monumentaly unfair for the people who were not able to collect them to have things go live that way,people who hoarded still have an advantage but its 1/10 or 1/15 of what it would have been</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe, maybe not. I know the environments get more seamless with every expansion. The gameplay footage for some areas--like the green, hilly areas for the Alliance in BFA--look amazingly coherent. They've started having much higher poly maps for sure--making edifices/cliffs/rocks/etc. out of just the ground modeling much more often instead of just rolling hills (vanilla &gt; just before Wrath) or inserting a lot of pre-formed rocks (WoD). The textures also have some interesting overlay meshing that isn't just fading them over one another--some textures with square tiles when placed with grass textures let the grass bleed through only the tile seems. A lot of things like that. Ability effects have also gotten much more complex, with many different layers of animated textures, stages, and props. They did a really cool demonstration of this with arcane spells during BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
I guess it's never going to be Frostbite, but eh. I can still get lost in the environments for a while before I memorize them/start ignoring them and flying over them. My biggest peeve right now is that I hope they work on water effects again with the island theme of BFA. Add in the option for dynamic waves and stuff vs. just the (I'm guessing normal mapping?) animated texture that flows over it. We started to see some animation in &quot;water&quot; in WoD when Tanaan released--the fel ooze sheets animate slightly if you watch along their shorelines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would you even try to have more grind to get a legendary in the end of the expansion when all raiding is already done and the best you can hope for is that said legendary will make your levelling in the next expansion a little easier? Legendaries don't even have a unique look, so even for transmog purposes they are irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Mac Pro 4,1<br />
Early 2009, limited to MacOS El Capitan, Running a GTX 680 :/<br />
<br />
GTX 680 is supported by both Metal 1 and 2. The reason you aren't running Metal is because Blizzard disabled it in anything before 10.12.x because 10.11's drivers were/are spectacularly buggy.<br />
<br />
You can update your Mac Pro 4,1 to a 5,1 freely (http://forum.netkas.org/index.php/topic,852.0.html) and then update to Sierra/High Sierra without issue. Your CPUs are fine. Your RAM is fine. It's Apple cockblocking you. You may need to temporarily install a fresh OS and boot from it (internally or externally, your choice) in order to successfully update the firmware, but once done, Apple's installer will let you do so and you'll have Metal and you'll cry rivers of joyful tears.<br />
<br />
Make sure to reset your SMC (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295) after the update to ensure the machine has taken to the new firmware properly. SMC resets are recommended after applying full version upgrades to the OS.</div></div><hr />

Anyone still on a 32 bit OS needs to upgrade. Not to sound harsh but them having to design for something as outdated as DX9/32 bit Operating Systems was holding the game back a lot in terms of optimization.<br />

If your computer is old, a SSD won't do any uselful changes in game (except loading time in major cities)</div></div><hr />

It has bigger impact than you think.<br />
<br />
I've replaced old hard drive with SSD about half a year ago on my 2012 iMac. It made huge difference in loading times everywhere, not just major cities. With old drive by time instance loaded people usually already pulled first packs, I could make cup of tea while Dalaran was loading, flying quickly often resulted in jerky rendering. With SSD instances and Dalaran were loading in just few seconds, flying is smooth even with bad graphics card.</div></div><hr />

That's not how it works. <br />
<br />
One must compare Classic to MoP first, that improvement is drastic. Then one must compare MoP to Legion. Almost no visible improvements at all.<br />
<br />
Time between Classic and MoP is 8 years. MoP happened like 6 years ago. The real graphic improvements stopped there, they just caught up some other parts of the game (like character models - the technology existed with pandaren already) to that level.<br />
<br />
Edit: The real improvement would be at particles and particle density. I can run the game smoothly at 60 fps, 1080p with my gtx 760 and core i5-4670k on &quot;7&quot; graphic settings at any environment, yet I get fps drops at some certain visual effetcs, even when I zoom the camera close to a random blazier fire effect.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because its their usual carrot on a stick method of doing things. I played this game for years, but just got completely sick and tired of their ever moving goal post that doesn't seem planned out. <br />
<br />
If I put in 1000 hours into an expansion, that's fine when there are tokens and time goals you are collecting for that WHOLE expansion that won't suddenly become invalid out of the blue. Its like starting over and over and over and over and over, and quiet frankly their graphics engine, content and design just doesn't cut it for me anymore. But its bad game design that is the real kicker. Moving the goal post at an expansion is one thing, moving it 12 times every 2 months inside one is just plane infuriating. Steady players will get sick of the grind (like me) and casuals will feel lost every time they pick it back up having missed tons of story that is pointless to even bother with anymore.<br />
<br />
I played for 12 years, but the real &quot;F this game moment&quot; came with legion and the increase of RNG and decrease of tokens worth direct purchases of choice (Not RNG tokens). If I want to &quot;grind&quot; it better damn well be worth the effort and time or I'm going to give the RNG god blizzard worships the big middle finger and the game using it the same. Last thing I want to do is spend 10 quests gathering tokens to turn them in for a random item of s$%t value. I'm not big into gathering tokens to get RNG crap even ONE time. I'm fine with RNG on level 1... maybe you get a token, maybe you don't on any given drop. But to grind for the CHANCE at something like a loot crate? That's my real world time wasted on a digital romp of frustration I just don't care to take anymore.</div></div><hr />

You can flash your 4,1 to 5,1 they are 99.9% identical - I did it with mine and it's not hard at all - it also means you can upgrade your CPU with a faster one - there are plenty on ebay for pretty cheap.<br />

Seems like you don't know what vaporware means.<br />
<br />
Legion's Dalaran is an almost exact copy, aside from a few structures and npc changes...which still aren't enough to account for the loading time, don't make stuff up.<br />
You are telling me people can load any area of the game without an issue BUT Dalaran is just too much...those textures must be amazing /s<br />

<br />
I have a Ryzen 7 1800 with a 1080 SC with 16gb of 3200 ram running at 3200 flying on a 256gb 961 samsung m.2 and I get with graphics maxed all the way out about 45-60 fps tops. WoW can take a lot of graphical power to run with all its ground fill/shadows/and volume lightning and rays. Which is also why wow has been kept looking to cartoony all these years. Improving means making things a lot more taxing on gpus/cpu's. You gotta figure, 100 people in a scene with old models was lets just say (10000) poly's of player model polygons. With the new models with that new player look you have 100 players at (100,000) poly's plus the larger textures and new shadows/lighting. So <br />
<br />
Also your 970 Isn't getting 100fps with everything on max. I will put a money bet on it that in person you don't get half of that even at 1080p because thats what I run. In some area's sure, looking at the sky sure, in suramar.. not a chance in hell.<br />

<br />
SSD isn't about making wow playable, its about allowing the game to load its gigs worth of content fast so that you don't have to wait hours for scenes and instances to load. Hard drive speed doesn't affect graphics, but it can affect read/write stability of the game if you are changing zones frequently. Try using an old 5200 laptop drive to run wow, then run wow off a m.2 and tell me you ever touch a spin drive again. It won't happen.</div></div><hr />
