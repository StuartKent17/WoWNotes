Another epic BlizzCon has come to a close. Soon the buzz and hum around the Anaheim Convention Center will just be a fading memory, but oh, what memories have been made!<br />
<br />
Inside the World of Warcraft<br />
<br />
The Instance Live!–*Taking you inside World of Warcraft news and discussion, Scott Johnson of fan favorite podcast “The Instance” hosted a live panel (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/watch?v=516b9cd-00d46a0c6e7)* along with Instance regular Patrick Beja, and guests Pat Krane from Convert to Raid, and World of Warcraft’s own Art Director Chris Robinson.<br />
<br />
The Art of World of Warcraft–*World of Warcraft artists provided an inside look (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/watch?v=516b9cd-00d46abbc50)* at character design, animation and world building, special effects including spells and all things that sparkle, environment design, dungeon art, and prop art within Battle for Azeroth. Each artist gave an inside look at their process for getting into the culture of the denizens within these new regions and creating the world that Azeroth’s Heroes will adventure through.<br />
<br />
DesignCraft | Building Blocks for Level Design–*World of Warcraft designers provided a first-hand look (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/watch?v=516b9cd-00d46a3f684) *at the overall process for creating the environments and points of interest within Azeroth that bring the world to life.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Battle for Azeroth Q&amp;A–*Focusing on the newly announced Battle for Azeroth expansion, player questions were gathered from BlizzCon 2017 attendees and community members from around the world to be answered live on the main stage. If you missed it, you can check out the coverage from Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/news=275490/blizzcon-2017-world-of-warcraft-q-a-more-character-slots-larger-backpack-upright&amp;brl), or watch the VoD (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/watch?v=516b9cd-00d46d47996)* on the BlizzCon site.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Boss Design Workshop–*The WoW encounter team invited the community to peek behind the scenes at their roundtable, where they brainstormed and designed a new dungeon boss from scratch. What would normally take months, was condensed to just a short 60-minute window.<br />
<br />
Taking Attendees into the Battle for Lordaeron<br />
<br />
10,000 lucky BlizzCon attendees were randomly selected to have their character printed in 3D and join the fray as either one of the Horde or the Alliance in the Battle for Lordaeron Diorama. Attendees were able to visit the site here (http://wowplayerdiorama.com/) to see if they made it to the battleground.<br />

Legion released 1 year and 1 month after the announcement. Beta started 3 months after announcement.<br />
<br />
This leads to BfA beta release: Feburary 2018<br />
BfA game release: November/December 2018 (e.g. right after Blizzcon)</div></div><hr />

So true lol, I served and would also do cosplay for fun... two things are not mutually exclusive, people think there's something wrong with other peoples fun &gt;.&gt;<br />

7.3.5 has nothing to do with Antorus, the essences are in the game already but they unlock with Antorus. 7.3.5 will probably make it to Ptr within the next few weeks, but don't expect a huge amount of development on it til the next year with Dec mostly Xmas/New years vacations (like how they shut alpha down two years ago). My guess? 7.3.5 in Feb/Mar with beta Mar/April</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think think it was just unfortunate timing with Blizzcon. They probably don't want to start next week since they need a break and need to catch up after the con and then that only gives one full week before we are into thanksgiving. It's definitely not ideal but i get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They still have a lot to do with Antorus.<br />
<br />
First, some bosses were at best a shitfest (Varimathras MM) or boring af, very likely some will be completely overhauled.<br />
Second, there are a lot of stuff that weren't tested and won't be, so we don't have any idea about the level of development. I mean, there isn't any mention to Sargeras in the current Antorus. I'm betting either on a Mythic Phase or an additional Mythic boss. Silithus' wound won't appear from nothing, and I don't really think they'll keep it only for the cinematic (that would be a bit underwhelming imo).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No hurry, as HS and OW are biggest cashcows now, had the feeling sometimes they lost a bit focus on wow as OW and HS surpasses the cashflow for blizz by miles with lootcrates and cardpacks. Q3 2017 was nearly 2000 million revenue, not long ago blizz went over 1000 million per year now its doubled the revenue in a quarter of time. Wow is now a tiny part of blizz revenue, and becoming more tiny every day as long OW and HS grow.<br />
<br />
And diablo is long forgotten lol, well i could imagine a diablo4 with lootcrates or any form of mtx one day, the IP is too strong to never touch it again(whole series sold like 50 million times).</div></div><hr />

It's Light vs Shadow on it represented tho (and in the BfA cinematic too) so it suggest void involvment in the AvH.</div></div><hr />
