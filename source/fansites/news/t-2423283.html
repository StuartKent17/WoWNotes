Top quality cinematic but the story is bit too straightforward. No twist, you perfectly know where it's going, that's a bit disappointing from Blizzard.<br />
But hey, she's cute as hell</div></div><hr />

i thought she was going to do a perpendicular pose before reaching the water, but falling on her back? yeah, she's definitely a goner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, at least she was injured. Most writers would have just had her wet or something.<br />
Though admittedly, this is pretty sci-fi. She might have some protection weaved into her suit there that absorbs shocks, given that her mech is designed for low-altitude flight. Future smart fabric could maybe do stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

That was the point. Similar to the news report at the start of the video, they aren't saying what she's REALLY doing. They're reporting on a persona, not a person.</div></div><hr />

Yeah Hana even says to not believe what he sees on the holovids. I thought the point was glaring. :confused:<br />

Considering he's most probably her brother as she even calls him that, I'd say the Friendzone is a good thing in this case ;).<br />
<br />
I've been seeing as many people also saying that what she calls him is, comparatively, something you'd say to a close male friend, not an actual blood relative.<br />

Not exactly a good moral for a team-based game...<br />
<br />
But I guess to do that they would have needed to model all the other mechs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hoping we get another playable mech pilot at some point. &quot;Casino&quot; looks the most unique/interesting of them. D.Mon's mech is probably too huge to be playable, Overlord's is actually more of an aircraft, and King's is basically the same mech that D.Va uses, albeit with a slightly different configuration.</div></div><hr />

CTF is only a mode in the Arcade FYI. The main maps are objective based, either payload escort, point capture, or king of the hill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's how I felt. It's like &quot;Every female character has to be a deep, serious character&quot;. This cinematic completely betrays everything that made her so unique. She's just another &quot;powerful female character&quot;, instead of embracing the absurdity that made her so charming. She lacks the distinctive personality to be memorable. I also *REALLY* hope that &quot;Johnny Friendzone&quot; (really digging that name) isn't Blizzard 'teasing' a future character. Dude was even more forgettable than she was in this cinematic.</div></div><hr />

As for it being change of character. It makes sense that is her propaganga character, nothing says &quot;relax, no worries, nothing bad will happen to. If I can laugh at danger so can you!&quot; as much as a frivolious character. <br />

The crossed and greyed out images probably meant their Mekas were destroyed. You can clearly see them on the press conference sitting next to D.Va. But they were all pretty banged up and as I said their Mekas were probably destroyed so they couldn't help even if they were there.</div></div><hr />

Every other line is just a trope or cliche. By the time it got to &quot;You don't have to do this alone&quot; i actually laughed out loud thinking it was going to be a parody of action movie one liners expecting it to be some clever thing where its d.va starring in a propaganda film about her heroics and there would be a 'cut' from off stage before the real characterisation starts but that never came. In retrospect maybe selling the character as a one dimensional gamer who dews the dew might actually be a massive detriment when trying to sell her as a multi layered human being instead of a doritos gremlin.</div></div><hr />
