<br />
I'm pretty sure the 4 Allied Races we are seeing will be the pre-order bonuses, that's the only logical reason why they would be included in 7.3.5, and why we haven't seen even a glimpse of Zandalari or Dark Iron Dwarves yet. Not to mention, the rewards for their racial armor are given at level 110.</div></div><hr />

I vaguely remember something about an &quot;A Team&quot; and a &quot;B Team&quot;, where the &quot;B Team&quot; took over development of WoW, while the &quot;A Team&quot; (formerly assigned to WoW) moved to a new IP. Not sure if this applies anymore, or when I first heard it, but I wonder if personnel have been moved around again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I can see I need to explain this in simpler terms then.<br />
When you &quot;preorder&quot; an expansion (That is - buying the expansion before its actual release), you may be rewarded with some features of said expansion. In preordering Legion, you were able to make a Demon Hunter before the actual release. People now predict/wish same feature applied to the allied races, in that when you preorder the expansion - you will be able to play the allied races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, after forever *wink* of Legion (since HFC) I am in love with any colour aesthetic in WoW that shifts away from green! <br />
<br />
Seriously though, the red (I thought) was a nice design and made me feel like the world was wounded... now less so, which I find disappointing -and more so because it's probably the the result of some feedback/focus group (red blood vs. green blood) etc. I doubt anyone in the Art department preferred the wound as Yellow vs Red.</div></div><hr />

That would basically equal to even less subs and less preorders though. I hope they aren't stupid and do release it only in the prepatch (esp. since they're now going to implement everything, so it's not a development issue). Releasing them in 7.3.5 would even fit with the updated lvling scaling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are caps. Old world at 60, TBC and Wrath 60-80, Cata and mop 80-90 wod 90-100. Within those groups eacb zone has a different minimum, but the same cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I do agree with manboiler , I'd prefer allied races to be released before BfA launch.<br />
Pre-Order bonuses doesn't make much sense, one would require way more time to prepare an allied race to new content than the classic pre-xpac events.<br />
<br />
To unlock Allied Races, one is supposed to fulfill some requirements, such as reputation capping and story chain quest completion.<br />
This way, newbies who manages to get interested in new races (thus more interested in gameplay as IMO race selection comes before class, as one plays usually mainly to reflect himself within the game) have their time to prepare theirselves before the new content goes live.<br />
<br />
I mean, it's a fair deal imo.<br />
If you think that there is a total of 6 new allied races on BfA release, giving this much time not only will keep users busy with something fresher, but also allow everybody to have what they want and need for when the real xpac core is gonna be released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At blizzcon at least, they said there would be some restrictions. TBC and Wrath are 60-80, Cata/MOP are 80-90, and certain old world zone would have restrictions as well (they specifically called out not being able to do Westfall at 55)</div></div><hr />

That's totally a different case in my opinion. Over the years I have been playing World of Warcraft on retail servers, in MY opinion leveling got worse and worse and worse, to the point that you literly one shot everything and that leveling a character is just a mindless grind. Some people might like it, well you had you're fun for the past 3 years or so. I like the leveling being harder and taking more time. And no I don't want to play on vanilla since I don't like the base vanilla game, I like the game how it is right now. So please come with good argument instead of just saying &quot;play classic servers&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's not relevant. It's outdated content. Your comparison is idiotic because Legion IS current content. Everything you do in Legion is current, and a lot of people levelign their characters want to hop into it, rather than be stuck for any longer in the 1-60 grind because some people are really bored and want to remain stuck in the old world and smell the flowers.</div></div><hr />

Actually not really..most of the 1-60 content is not vanilla anymore but cataclysm....The original lvl 1-60 mostly gone by the wind (like Order must be restored quest or the Guardians of the Altar quest....which is a great loss for me :P)</div></div><hr />

your comment is idiotic.. so you say only current content is relevant... -.- thats dumb .. all of the game is content.. it doesnt have to be current expansions.. people play alts or go complete archievements of older expansions.. go for mounts, etc.<br />
<br />
if someone wants to play latest content then he/she will level if they find it fun, if not then they will use the instant level that comes with &quot; latest content &quot;. levelig its a part of the game. always was and will be.<br />

Yes, only current content is relevant. 1-60 content is 6 to over 10 years outdated depending. If you want to wallow in it, your choice, but leveling shouldn't be any more tedious than it was before 7.3.5. If they want to do older content, that's their prerogative, but people that just want to jump into the current content should be able to do so without a hassle, not think twice about leveling their new shaman to 110 because on top of the 90-100 and 100 to 110 experience, 1-60 was also made into a chore because a few people want to be forced to be in old content for longer periods, when that choice is literally their own to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've increased the required experience for hitting level 20 and 40 but by the looks of it the amount for hitting 60 remains relatively unchanged. We currently have no indication how much experience we're receiving from killing monsters or from quests outside of someone manually checking it on the PTR. You're complaining because it's going to take a little longer, which will most likely allow people to experience how the game will be played as it'll work closer to how it does for the 100-110 leveling. The whole point of these changes is to bring the rest of the game in line with how it plays at higher levels so that players are able to acclimatize to that throughout their journey.<br />
<br />
At present the pre-90 levels may as well be a completely different game at this point. So when they start to approach those higher levels they're being thrown by those changes rather than welcoming them. That is if they even make it that far in the first place. The main sticking point is that the game isn't fun at lower levels because everything is so simple and easy there is no reason to maintain any focus on what you're trying to do. Thereby resulting in faster burnout for the players. Slightly longer but more rewarding leveling is not going to make that worse by any stretch.<br />
<br />
Also, outside of Ghostlands, Eversong, Bloodmist and Azuremist isles the rest of the old 1-60 content was revamped during Cataclysm which actually made it far more current than the existing 60-80 content. Not to mention that this is also allowing people to switch between a choice of two different expansions for the 60-80 or 80-90 bracket which is going to allow them a great deal more freedom than having to be bogged down during the leveling procedure. Same with the level pool for dungeons being expanded across the board as well.</div></div><hr />

This tbh. I presume the encoded &quot;dog&quot; mount is probably the collectors edition mount as well. The Zandalari we meet in Zandalar, duh, and the Dark Iron Dwarves in Kul'Tiras. I presume we'll unlock them by completing the Zandalar and Kul'Tiras quest zones fully.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point still remains that leveling from 1-110 is a chore for people that just want to get it over with. The current changes aren't so much a problem - they're fairly minuscule all things considered, but I disagree highly with the notion that we need to make leveling lengthier at all, instead of shorter.<br />
<br />
At some point, we're gonna need some kind of squish. Either exp gets buffed through the roof or the levels get squished, because I have no intention to keep leveling alts if in a few years, I'll have 150 levels to get through and 8-9 expansions of leveling content just to be able to get somewhere in current content.</div></div><hr />

In all seriousness, I almost feel like I'm paying them to test their game... Want to encourage people to legit test their product and provide real feedback, then get people to sign up for a tester pool, those accepted are the ones that get the invites, access to special forums, etc. and when they login and provide proper feedback and submit bugs, etc. they get WoW credit towards live or some kind of special ingame pet/mount/item to reward them.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe Blizz is trying to make a leveling experience that doesn't feel like a plotless snoozefest for new players so that they don't quit the game before they hit max level. I could have sworn people citing slower leveling as part of what made the vanilla wow experience enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is that every new expansion increases the time it takes to level by a significant amount. For an average player who puts in 5-6 hours a week, it would take a very long time to get to max level, which is what most new players (who just bought their NEW EXCITING LEGION CONTENT! game) really want to see. It is this that really makes new players ditch the game during the leveling process I think.<br />
<br />
The pacing also feels very bad, mostly due to how long it takes. There are a finite number of class abilities so with 110 levels you only get new buttons (and feel more powerful) maybe once every 6-8 levels.<br />
<br />
With yet another expansion coming, what Blizz really needs to do is revamp the leveling system so that there are multiple shorter paths you can take. For example, let players skip 2 expansions, for example BC and Cata, and go from 1 to 110 via Classic -&gt; Wrath -&gt; Mists -&gt; Legion, scaling the XP you get. Cut the overall time in half, increase the pacing, and make the quests that people do actually feel like a story and I think you will see more new players stick around.<br />
<br />
For better or worse, the experience of just getting to max level is no longer a fun feature of WoW like it was during vanilla -- it's now just a chore that everyone has to do, a price you have to pay, to get a new or alt character to max level where you can play the &quot;real game&quot;. The fact that Blizz sells boosts now proves that point.</div></div><hr />

I think there are other factors that you missed that lend itself well to the new system, for example, the fact that you can now experience the whole story of a zone without being booted out due to moot experience gain and useless quest rewards. The fact that zones also scale means that you'll be more likely to see other players questing in the open world, and you can already choose to skip TBC in favor of Wrath and Cataclysm in favor of Pandaria, that will be big.</div></div><hr />

And that is what Blizzard is trying to fix with these changes. Trying to fix it so that people once again might feel like leveling is something more than a 72 hour long, sad joke. By not having lowbie-levels being so pathetically easy that your brain turns off completely, like leveling is on Live. Because on Live leveling is exactly how you describe it. A pre-game mode that insult you as a player, for XX hours until you get to &quot;endgame&quot; where there's content that might actually kill you, so that is feels like an actual RPG.<br />
<br />
If you want to actually enjoy leveling, mobs have to hurt, your abilities other than damage/speed has to make a difference (which they don't when a mob cast spell hits you for 2% of your total health), bosses in dungeons aren't supposed to die in less than 10 damn seconds. They are supposed to be bosses. Instead the tank doesn't give a shit about his health because it doesn't move and the healer is falling asleep, while the dps who was 2 seconds behind start doing damage to a boss that is already a quarter dead.<br />
<br />
Complete joke and I cannot wait until scaling hits Live, so that I can once again level a caster and actually have time to cast something before it dies.<br />
World mobs are still a bit of a joke and hopefully Blizzard aren't too scared of buffing them further.</div></div><hr />

I'm about to level several characters... I think the changes are a great idea, I pretty much out level every zone by about the halfway point. <br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
I am not going to level characters on the PTR... I hate leveling, it's alright right up to 60. But once you starting hitting those expansion XP increases questing becomes absolute hell.<br />
<br />
If there was an incentive to level on the PTR that would help me get a few max characters on live (because getting max level characters into raids is my only right now) I would not only level on PTR, but would also put real time and effort into providing detailed feedback... But, since I will probably be max level on several characters before 7.3.5 even hits live, doing so will have almost zero impact on my experience for the foreseeable future and will also not get me any closer to one of my only goals in WoW at the moment...<br />
<br />
If you want people on the PTR testing the changes, give them an incentive. Because as it is right now, for a lot of people, leveling is nothing but a necessary evil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must try to remember that this game is quite old and we're a couple of expansions in. To drag out the leveling process, especially for players who have been playing the game for a very long time isn't a very good solution. As for mobs dying, that's kinda the point of leveling? If you want a challenge that's what raids are there for. You see when it comes to pve leveling content in a mmo it has to be properly balanced so that all classes are somewhat equal, that usually means that they have to make it &quot;easier&quot;. If they did not, then you'd have some really awkward scenarios like in some very old mmos(yes, older than wow) where say you're leveling a healer and you're beating on a mob for a couple of minutes to kill it. Does that sound fun to you? No, it is not.<br />
<br />
Let's just get ONE thing straight here, wow has *NEVER* been hard when it comes to leveling, not in any way or form. That's what made it stand out from the rest back then. You didn't need 2 accounts with a buffbot just to ease the leveling, you didn't have to spend months leveling grinding to get anywhere in the game. It was aimed towards casuals. At most wow was tedious while leveling some classes, shadow priest comes to mind, you know when they actually had mana issues and it was the least fun class to level by far. I'm glad they made changes to the game since then because honestly, that wasn't fun at all. <br />
<br />
I don't mind them increasing the experience cap while leveling, but I think they took the easy way out when it came to the scaling. It was very cheap and lazy in my book. It should have had a far broader range. Nothing should stop you from going to hellfire at level 15 and quest there. It's just *leveling* content. Anyways, that's what would have made the leveling more &quot;fun&quot; for me, getting to pick what zones I wanted to level in, but we don't really get to do that. I mostly level through dungeons these days anyways(or rather before I actually hit 50 100+ characters).</div></div><hr />

I feel like it's more and more likely we're getting some races in 3.5</div></div><hr />

I could have sworn people citing slower leveling as part of what made the vanilla wow experience enjoyable.<br />
<br />
People who cite that are literally masochists. I played through Vanilla. It sucked. There is nothing fun about needing to spend several days to level 10 times.

<br />
90% of the reported Bugs make it to Live anyways. Might as well use Live for testing.<br />
<br />
They sort of do.<br />
<br />
Also, a while back we all got bitched out for &quot;complaining too much&quot; during the PTR about things that were very, very broken. It was put to us that, no, the PTR was not about finding and fixing anything broken; at this point in the development cycle, everything is locked in and we don't care if it actually works out or not - someone's hung their yearly achievement bullet point on this content, mechanic, or whatever, so it's going in. The PTR is for load testing and fixing &quot;critical errors&quot; (only things that directly affect whatever this patch's gimmick is - generally PVP or raid content).<br />
<br />
Most of us who did honest burn testing on patch content checked out after that, leaving the PTRs to endless premade seekers to punch each other in the face, apparently as God intended.</div></div><hr />
