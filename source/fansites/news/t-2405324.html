Beta Build Update - 6/19/2018<br />
Greetings all, <br />
<br />
Realms came down a bit ago to facilitate a new build update. No ETA for today's push but things should be coming up soon.<br />
<br />
Also, character copy will be enabled! Please note that under load, the character copy system could fail to create at times due to volume of requests. If things seem slow, take a deep breath, wait a bit and try again later.<br />
<br />
I'll leave this thread open for discussion as long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience everyone!<br />
