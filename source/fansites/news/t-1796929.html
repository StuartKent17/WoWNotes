<br />
Patch 6.2 - Infernal Direwolf<br />
Patch 6.2 adds the Infernal Direwolf (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127140-infernal-direwolf) mount, which is earned by completing the Glory of the Hellfire Raider (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10149-glory-of-the-hellfire-raider) achievement. <br />

<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire Races<br />
The Darkmoon Faire is back again, bringing us the final race, in addition to the other Patch 6.1 changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4748-Darkmoon-Faire-Race-and-Changes-Archaeology-Fix-Blue-Tweets-Method-Interview-DLC). The Powermonger is the new mount this time around.<br />
<br />
The first race uses the smaller course, allowing you to earn Powermonger: Gold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9785-powermonger-gold) and the Gaze of the Darkmoon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122120-gaze-of-the-darkmoon).<br />
<br />
The second race uses the big course, allowing you to earn Big Powermonger: Gold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9817-big-powermonger-gold) and the Darkmoon Cannon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122124-darkmoon-cannon). The Cannon is not a toy, so it will take up an additional inventory slot. <br />
<br />
The Powermonger mount jumps to powerups (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152725-jump-to-powerup). It also has a Battery (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/153026-battery) ability that absorbs the next powerup you hit in the next 4 seconds. This powerup can then be used later by using the Battery ability again. The Overwrite (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152985-overwrite) ability allows you to overwrite a nearby powerup with the stored one, but requires the currency powerup. It isn't necessary to earn the achievements. The final ability, Summon Aggrobots (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/153503-summon-aggrobots), will taunt the mini-zeppelins, allowing you to pass by without getting stunned. <br />
<br />
The trick this month is to jump to springs and use the battery to absorb the spring right before you land on it. This allows you to use the spring to jump twice, once when you hit it and once again with the stored jump. You also can store a rocket before the big race to jump up the cliff to the first checkpoint. This can be accomplished by starting a race, storing your rocket, running back, abandoning the quest, and starting again. <br />

PvP<br />
In addition, Ashran should not put entire raids into 1 instance. People are getting rofl-stomped by premades. @holinka<br />
You won't be able to enter Ashran while in a raid. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/605476541225525248))<br />
<br />
this problem was adressed in several forum posts during alpha and beta.but some forums feel like a dead end (especially non-US).<br />
Based on feedback from players during beta, we gave all players passive expertise. The issue at hand is to increase it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/605549904040042496))<br />
that change felt like motivated by pve (bosses turning around into parry etc). at least the way it was communitcated.<br />
The passive expertise I mentioned is associated with Battle Fatigue, a PvP only buff, so it's probably a different issue. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/605550855106920449))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Flying<br />
What's your stand on the &quot;no more flying in WoW&quot; stance the devs have taken?<br />
Even if you don't like a particular change, you should want people unafraid to make bold decisions running your game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602159297296928768))<br />
Not everyone wants a taxi driver bold enough to risk getting both of you killed trying to get to the airport though.<br />
I'm not looking for a taxi ride to keep me engaged though. I very much ask that of a game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602997137899560960))<br />
<br />
These have all been successfully countered in previous expansions by creative design.<br />
I can understand the argument that it's tough to live without flying once you are used to it (genie in a bottle analogy). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602995311598915585))<br />
OTOH I don't put much stock into the argument that clever quest and level design can make flight as challenging as ground. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602995537546055680))<br />
The combat wasn't designed with 3d space in mind. They could build all that, or they could focus all that attention elsewhere. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602995083068121088))<br />
I kinda think orcs firing nets constantly and every quest objective inside a cave would get tiring quickly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602994875684892672))<br />
Much more interested in the difference in flight speed. Allowing flight at a low speed and gaining speed in xpac = prog<br />
We messed with that some. It always felt very forced and awkward. Not saying it isn't theoretically possible. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602998137582583808))<br />
I think if you want aerial combat, you build a game about aerial combat. Adding it in later is challenging (and we tried in Lk). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602998271653466112))<br />
<br />
Grounding while leveling is a begrudgingly accepted pathway. However, 6 months to a year into an xpac, flight wouldn't harm.<br />
Maybe. I'm not informed enough to have an opinion on the current content. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602998479128952832))<br />

<br />
His position of commenting on the past (within reason) and playing devil's advocate to questions people ask allows him far more freedom to communicate with players than the actual developers. Every single word they write is scrutinized for hints of what is to come and potential slights against players. He's just a guy giving his opinion now. <br />
<br />
When Ghostcrawler says that the arguments about clever quest design negating the risks and that the game just isn't well suited to have flying, no one comes at him with pitchforks for &quot;ignoring customers&quot; or being too stupid/arrogant/ignorant/indifferent to develop a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today's tweets were a thinly veiled message that flying ain't coming back. He's friends with the WoW devs, you know he has the inside scoop. But, I agree, it's time to leave him alone. I know he likes to talk in the abstract about his time at Blizzard, but he's not going to give anyone any hints or reveals. <br />
<br />
Moving on...a wolf for the meta is kind strange - the wolf is iconic for the Horde - while it's nice to get a wolf as Alliance, it's odd. And it looks silly with a saddle. <br />
<br />
The mount should be a green glowing fel gronn. With lasers.<br />
<br />

<br />
We knew about the copy pasted wolf mount weeks ago but it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. In the past they've never really been inventive when it came to glory mounts but this one takes the cake for the least amount of effort put into it. If they wanted to go with a wolf mount they should of used the iron horde wolf with the armour which is currently unobtainable by players. <br />
<br />
I suppose this expansion we've gotten used to disappointment and copy pastes left right and centre.<br />
<br />
I think it's odd there's been no traveler's mount/yak this time. A portable Garrison mount is kind of a no-brainer, and mounts with vendors have been widely popular with players since they were released. But then, the list of disapointments with the game is 10x longer than the things they got right, at this point. <br />
<br />
Oh, my bad, I said something negative, now I'm going to get jostled by white knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I feel you. They have done this in the past but it just seems even worse. I think it has to do with the quality of the store mounts vs the chiev ones. They could have done a really cool Fel version of the wolf from SoO. Green blood dripping through a broken horn, idk something more then just a hue &amp; saturation change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-06-08, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mounts they're missing currently are a spectral mount (1 or more have been released in every expansion going back to the Spectral Tiger), a passenger mount, and a vendor mount. Unless there's a 6.3 in the pipeline, this will be the first expansion to not have a spectral mount and the first since WotLK to not have a passenger/vendor mount. Blizzard had a trend going and now it seems they're trying to break it. And they wonder why people get mad. People are creatures of habit. Most of us don't like abrupt change without reason.<br />
<br />
Begs the question why they'd go with a plain ordinary wolf for the raid meta. Not something I'll see for a long time (if ever), but still. Yet another wolf. At least it's not another boar, I guess we can be thankful for that. I guess players attacking them for adding flying mounts in a non-flying expansion (I.E. Solar Spirehawk, Corrupted Dreadwing, etc) has resulted in Blizzard being rather uncreative with mounts. The most creative mounts they made were flying mounts and now they can't add those without a mass of hostility thrown at them. But hey, they'll do better next expansion, right? ... Right? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats pretty much how any meaningful graph presents its data. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del on a PC and go to the Performance tab of task manager and check out the graphs there, even they resize to show the data in a meaningful way. If I look at the graph of activity over my ethernet connection it doesn't grab from 0 to 1000mbit/s if the max I'm only hitting is 100kb/s, it changes its scale to show the data in a meaningful way.</div></div><hr />

This. I am actually glad I'm not the only one who thinks that way. Seriously, why should we care about him anymore?

Honestly, I think GC moved on because of the way things were getting with the state of WoW (or a better job offer with a lot more $$$).

What's the problem? It's not like Blizzard even do original models for Achievement rewards anymore. Just go to the store. <br />
<br />
Is it dumb that I was expecting at least some flamey particle effects on the Direwolf? At least it has a running animation, unlike the boar animation. Honestly I'd be pretty embarrassed if I was them, releasing so many new boars without even trying to improve its running animation. <br />

I'll still do them since I'm an achievement whore, but yes, they're incredibly stupid. It's not even about racing to get a good time - it's about cheesing the mechanics of the race to essentially cheat. Like on the big race the way to get gold is to jump up the side of the mountain. That's not racing. That's cheating to cut out half of the damn race.<br />
The one race achievement I refuse to bother getting is the big race for the tallstrider - it's almost impossible to get alone (or it's at least magnitudes harder without someone else to cheese it with), and the reward is some stupid item that takes up a bag space and has limited charges anyway. So that one I don't care about.</div></div><hr />

Only because you can't get them with every race/faction as a basic doesn't diminish the fact, that many are just recolours, even some of those that you mention. Many drakes are based on Netherwing model/skeleton or a protodrake. <br />
<br />
Frostbroods were S5-S8 gladiator mounts. Firehawks have the same skeleton as protodrakes. Pandaria is flooded with cloud serpents. Galakras -&gt; Protodrake. Skyscreamer is the only real exception.<br />

<br />
If we're talking skeletons it's pretty redundant as they're all repeated everywhere - I'd swear every other mount in WOD has that same bloody Direhorn skeleton and animations. <br />
<br />
Different models is different models though, and the ones listed were all unique models, albeit some heavily retooled from others. <br />
<br />
Firehawks, for example, though sharing the Proto-Skeleton are a VERY different look. It's ridiculous to even compare it to them slapping a green tint on a wolf. Another wolf mount (of which we already have 8) with just a green colour pallette is truly pathetic for the reward for the most difficult PVE Achievement of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

The meta for Wrath was a mount you could only get by raiding, and one of the coolest ones they ever did. Dragon Soul had a unique mount. SOO had a unique mount. <br />

<br />
It's not the best they could come up with. Don't fool yourself that they put more than a couple minutes into deciding this. <br />
<br />
This is the best they bothered to come up with. <br />
<br />
Hate to say it, but they're cutting corners on raiding, too. I won't predict what that means for the future, because it could be just them giving up on WoD, and putting all their effort into the next expansion. Or they just don't give a fuck anymore. Time will tell. But ya - even I supported unique rewards for raiding, even though I don't raid and have issues with that community. This isn't sad, it's insulting. The Metas are legit a lot of work to get. <br />
<br />
It's the same artists who made all the previous mounts in the game. They're capable of so, so, so much better, but not even raiders are worth the effort now. Where is that design time and creativity going? It's certainly not going into WoD. They put more effort into the ship models for the shipyards, that you will only see at your dock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But are you fucking telling me, Blizzard, that the GLORY achievement for the newest raid in an expansion already goddamn littered with disappointing reskin mounts that really hammer home the idea that cool mounts should cost $25, not be worth effort is FUCKING GREEN WOLF? I'm sorry, I already have a Garn Nighthowl that's a black version of this, and I'd rather ride that, even though I never use it anyway. If I'm going to go through the trouble of doing ALL the Hellfire achieves, don't you think it should be for something worth the effort? <br />
<br />
It's not like Glory mounts have never been reskins, because the Black and Plagued proto-drakes, the very first Glory mounts, were certainly that, but seriously? A WOLF? You couldn't up the ante a bit, and make the reward that cool as fuck Darmac wolf with the model that's currently unavailable to players? That thing would actually get me excited, and looks interesting enough to warrant being a Glory mount. It's awesome, just like the Gorestrider Gronnling is awesome. <br />
<br />
But this... this is abyssmal, it's like the WoW devs are parodying themselves. (I have an active subscription and have been subbed forever, don't intend to stop unless the next xpac is Warlords 2.) Ugh. C'mon guys, that sickly green piece of shit isn't worth the effort, especially since it probably took such a minuscule amount to make.</div></div><hr />

Or the black Ravager mount thats unavailable to players. I would KILL for that mount; loads of NPCs ride it... but itd make the store mount less special so we know what's more important. <br />

If you haven't noticed, things have been on a steady decline for a while now (tho nothing as bad as WoD) and Blizzard has shown no desire to change course, but rather are diving head-first into the marketing over quality model. <br />
