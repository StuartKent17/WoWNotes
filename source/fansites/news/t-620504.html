In my own speculation, I think the Argent healers were just to help ease the transition to the world event-- it gives anybody with the ability to cleanse diseases time to figure out what side they wish to be on. With the Argent npc's gone, it will allow for the event to be player-supported.</div></div><hr />

Killed myself with Hellfire and started infecting the level 60 murloc areas. I ended up working my way all the way the the front of Greengill Coast and man it was great. The murlocs spawn fast enough to keep the packs of zombies huge and anybody that comes near them, even paladins are getting turned faster than they can kill them. It was a major riot today and nobody could quest in the area. I logged off for a few hours and came back, they were still rampant in the area. Total chaos!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thanks! Really great tip that gave me two of the funniest hours in my WoW history<br />
<br />
I just did the same in OG. 3 People got locked in, the rest stayed outside. Nobody had a clue that it was a zombie who brought the gate down. And the best thing: the three locked people didn't really complain or port out. They startet roleplaying. They made a fire inside, sat down and talked like people stuck in an elevator waiting for their rescue. Soon that RP idea spread to the persons who wanted inside. They developed a story around this little change. Halls of Legend became a bunker against the plague. Only those who died outside and moved in as a ghost to revive were allowed to join that exclusive club. Unfortunately the only way to die in range for that is becoming a zombie and get yourself killed. Sounds easy. If there just wasn't that Pally-girl who liked to cleanse infected and made herself the guardian and holy inquisition for the the halls of legend.<br />
<br />
It was so much fun to watch and take part in that. The gates are still closed and no one got the right idea how to open them again. Those few zombies who came close to the door were killed fast enough. After I spread the idea that it was our duty to protect the door as long as we could no one let a zombie come close again. Only those who died defending the door are worthy to be reborn in the save place. I guess that story will go on for some hours. I am very curious whether its still locked tomorrow morning.<br />
<br />
And all that great RP happened just because I closed a simple little gate. :)</div></div><hr />
