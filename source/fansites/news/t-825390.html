Guild Flask and Cauldron Hotfixes 
We've recently implemented a number of hotfixes directly related to guild achievements, flasks, and cauldrons. When first designing the guild achievements, we overestimated the number of flasks that guilds would be able to make by the time they reached guild level 10, and set the number of Cataclysm flasks required for the two related guild achievements to 10,000 (Mix Master) and 25,000 (Better Leveling" />

Guild Flask and Cauldron Hotfixes<br />
We've recently implemented a number of hotfixes directly related to guild achievements, flasks, and cauldrons. When first designing the guild achievements, we overestimated the number of flasks that guilds would be able to make by the time they reached guild level 10, and set the number of Cataclysm flasks required for the two related guild achievements to 10,000 (Mix Master (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5465/mix-master/)) and 25,000 (Better Leveling Through Chemistry (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5024/better-leveling-through-chemistry/)). In reality, most guilds have made fewer flasks than we had originally anticipated they would at this point in guild progression, and many players will soon be unlocking a guild perk (Chug-A-Lug (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/83945/chug-a-lug/)) directly related to cauldrons and flasks.<br />
<br />
Today, we've applied a few hotfixes to help bring these flask-related achievements in line with what we had originally intended:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mix Master (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5465/mix-master/) now requires your guild to craft 1,000 Cataclysm flasks (down from 10,000).<br />
<br />
<br />
Better Leveling Through Chemistry (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5024/better-leveling-through-chemistry/) now requires your guild to craft 3,000 Cataclysm flasks (down from 25,000).<br />
<br />
<br />
We felt it was important to implement these changes as a hotfix rather than waiting for the next content patch, as many guilds will be unlocking the Chug-A-Lug perk this weekend. Please note that while the new values are already in effect, the in-game tooltips will not reflect these changes until the next client patch. If your guild has already reached the new requirement, you'll receive the achievement as soon as someone in your guild creates a new flask.<br />
<br />
In addition, we've made a couple other cauldron-related changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure the Big Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92688/big-cauldron-of-battle/) attained from Better Leveling Through Chemistry (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5024/better-leveling-through-chemistry/) feels like a substantial upgrade over the &quot;regular&quot; version, the number of flasks it generates has been increased from 17 to 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both cauldrons now last 10 minutes (up from 5).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're unfamiliar with guild cauldrons, here's a quick breakdown of how they work:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unlocking the Recipes: Guilds can unlock the Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92643/cauldron-of-battle/) alchemy recipe by completing the Mix Master achievement, and the Big Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92688/big-cauldron-of-battle/) recipe by completing the Better Leveling Through Chemistry achievement. Buying either recipe from the guild vendor costs 150 gold and requires you to have reached honored reputation with your guild and an Alchemy skill of 525.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creating the Cauldrons: A Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92643/cauldron-of-battle/) is a soulbound, one-time use item that requires a mix of 4 Cataclysm flasks and 8 Deathblood Venom to create. When the alchemist places a cauldron on the ground, up to 7 Flasks of Battle can be conjured from it before it's exhausted. While these flasks are tradable, they cannot be sold on the Auction House and will be removed from your inventory if you log out for 15 minutes -- just like mage food. When consumed, the flask automatically gives you the most appropriate buff for your class and spec for 1 hour. The Big Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92688/big-cauldron-of-battle/) works just the same, only it requires a mix of 12 Cataclysm flasks and yields 20 flasks rather than 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild Perk Benefits: As guilds level up, they'll receive perks that affect these cauldrons and flasks. At guild level 10, you earn the guild perk Chug-A-Lug, which increases the duration of Flasks of Battle by 50% -- meaning flasks from guild cauldrons will now last 1.5 hours instead of one. At guild level 20, the Happy Hour perk increases the number of flasks conjured from a guild cauldron by 50% (i.e.10 from a Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92643/cauldron-of-battle/) instead of 7; 30 from a Big Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92688/big-cauldron-of-battle/) instead of 20). Finally, at guild level 22, you'll earn an improved version of Chug-A-Lug, which increases the duration of Flasks of Battle by 100%, bringing it up to 2 hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate all the feedback we've received so far on the Guild Perk system, and we'll continue to make improvements to ensure it's a fun and rewarding endeavor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Jan. 5<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
<br />
January 4-5<br />
General<br />
<br />
Mix Master (guild achievement) is now awarded at 1,000 flasks, down from 10,000, and Better Leveling Through Chemistry (guild achievement) is awarded at 3,000 flasks, down from 25,000. It turns out we overestimated these numbers just a smidgen. More information can be found here.<br />
The 7th and 8th guild bank tabs will now let players withdraw and deposit items after the guild master is changed.<br />
All six of the guild battle standards have had their experience and honor gain buffs increased to 5/10/15%, up from 2/4/6%, and they last for a duration of 10 minutes.<br />
Haste buffs no longer reduce the effectiveness of haste on resource regeneration rates (energy, focus, etc.).<br />
&quot;Smart&quot; food ended up not being so smart. Players who have small amounts of dodge rating as a vestige of some item bugs in the past will no longer get a dodge buff when they eat &quot;smart&quot; food like Cataclysm feasts if they are not plate tanks. Other classes and specializations will get their dominant primary stat.<br />
<br />

Cho’gall always receives the appropriate amount of the appropriate buff when consuming an elemental. The elementals are unable to fall below 1 health or otherwise be killed, so Cho’gall always gets 1 stack of the corresponding buff at minimum.<br />
Shadow Lords will no longer regenerate health under any circumstance.<br />

<br />
<br />
Deadmines<br />
<br />
Heroic Deadmines now has significantly less trash mobs.<br />
The mechanical nightmare section of the Vanessa VanCleef encounter has less sparks of doom, and is notably easier and faster to navigate.<br />

Both cauldrons now last 10 minutes. Please note the tooltips will not be updated until a client-side patch is applied.<br />
The Big Cauldron of Battle now has 20/30 charges instead of 17/25. Please note the tooltip will not be updated until a client-side patch is applied.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
All eight of the Engineering discoveries are now able to be learned through crafting the Overpowered Chicken Splitter at max-level Engineering.<br />

<br />
Tol Barad<br />
<br />
The number of guard spawns has been increased for both Horde and Alliance base camps, with guards now surrounding the edges of each camp. Both Alliance and Horde guards use all abilities that the Furious Hyjal Warden uses and will attack with ranged abilities when unable to find a path, or at a distance. Guards are also immune to taunt effects. In addition, Hellscream and Baradin Guards now respawn more quickly.<br />
The northern graveyards on Tol Barad Peninsula for each faction have been moved further apart from one another to lessen the fantastic camping.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Tol Barad requires a fairly significant redesign. Fixing cauldrons could be done way more easily and faster, with just a hotfix, and is likely being handled by a completely different team of developers with a different timeline than those discussing and redesigning Tol Barad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More like allowing guilds to receive these achievments in the next 3 months instead of somewhere in 2012/2013? Also, Tol Barad won't be fixed with a hotfix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree completely, but farming mats for the 300 Intellect flasks is a royal pain in the ass. Much more work per flask than it ought to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely a welcome change for a small guild that hits cap everynight but isn't large enough to possibly hit that many Flasks in Cata's lifetime.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaka</div><div class="date">2011-01-06, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tol Barad requires a fairly significant redesign.

<br />
It's not so much that they haven't fixed TB that irritates me. Sure, it's great that they fixed Cauldrons and put them more in reach of guilds at the intended level. What irritates me is that they've completely and totally failed to at least even acknowledge and say &quot;yes guys, we know that Tol Barad was poorly designed and we've discretely killed and disposed of the designer responsible. We're working on a way to make this an enjoyable and balanced battleground and the new designer knows that his life is at stake.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snorri</div><div class="date">2011-01-06, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent change. I always thought 10 000 and 25 000 flasks were a bit too much, especially with the reagents needed. The cauldrons might be situational useful while raiding. It also felt weird to demand so many flasks made while having a momentarily useless guild perk.</div></div><hr />

i believe all flasks persist thru death, your probably thinking of elixirs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both true. And the Blizzard explanation makes sense. We are close to 10 but only 360/1000 flasks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol. Maybe you don't quite get the sheer volume of flasks needed to hit this achievement, and the materials needed right now to make said flasks.<br />
<br />
Our guild has been making quite a few already, and we're just at 600. 10,000? Get real. Maybe in a year.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bawl</div><div class="date">2011-01-06, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good, good. Next I hope they reconsider the 7/20 flasks per cauldron until guild level 20 thing. It makes them sorta, well, not useless, but awkward until you gain the bonus flasks so a whole raid can benefit from one cauldron. I guess you can roll to see who's not getting one, or fastest click wins, or something...</div></div><hr />

And by the time I finish my regular routine of herbing for Azshras Veil, I come out with minimum 5 stacks, laugh my way to the AH *cackles*<br />
<br />
This is a much welcome change to guilds. Some people may complain, but have you ever given a thought to how a 10man guild feels with such huge numbers? Would take months and months to make 10,000 if not a year or more for raids. Think of the herb costs and time too on that. 1k/3k is definately welcome and is in reach for both 10 and 25! Now lets get some fishing love and bring that down from 10,000 to 3,000 ;)<br />
<br />
It be great if they slightly lowered the mats from 12 to maybe 8 or so per herb, it be nice really, and the prices on AH would drop a lot too :)</div></div><hr />

Even if they upped the mats a *tad* it would work out just as well imo when it comes to raiding, which i assume is what most, if not all people will want to be using them for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At guild level 20, the Happy Hour perk increases the number of flasks conjured from a guild cauldron by 50% (i.e.10 from a Cauldron of Battle instead of 7; 30 from a Big Cauldron of Battle instead of 20).<br />
<br />
Big cauldron will make 30 flasks so you'll only be using one cauldron during a 25 man.</div></div><hr />

I'd expect you to gain a bonus to the buff, but not the duration. And since everyone will be using the same cauldrons, the duration should be universal anyway :)</div></div><hr />

(7Battle:4Cata = 1.75:1, 20:12 = 1.66~:1)<br />
<br />
In other words, the &quot;Big&quot; one stiffs you one Flask (21:12 = 1.75:1). So you're taking a loss of one flask in order to avoid gathering 24 Deathblood Venom. And frankly, my experience has shown that Stormvine is RIDICULOUSLY easy to come by... so personally I'd rather suck it up and spend another few minutes gathering.</div></div><hr />

But that's what the cannons were for, you just get people to use them and the trash becomes nothing for where you can use them(Start &amp; Ship). Nerfs were certainly NOT needed tbh..

This is not what they meant. For example some haste buffs for Hunters will reduce our Focus Regeneration below normal speed instead of increasing them. If you get a haste reduction buff obviously it will be reducing your regeneration, but they are talking about haste buffs which would mean when you gain more haste not when you lose it otherwise they would be saying haste DEbuffs.</div></div><hr />

I think its interesting that they decided to nerf the achievement by 90% of what they expected it to be in order to be realistic, but did not acknowledge the obvious overnerf of deepholm and twilight highlands herb nodes at all.

Due to the entire guild having learned all their glyphs pre cata launch, and there being only 1-2 scribes in the guild, and herbs are so expensive, I don't see this achievement ever being completed.<br />
<br />
Also, as an alchemist, mixology having the potency buff alone does not make it worth keeping. Other professions carry around their buffs all the time, while grinding, pvping or doing 5-mans, and don't require you to make an item that you have to refresh every hour. The duration buff to mixology was a great saving in money (or farming time) which set it apart from the other professions. <br />
<br />
With the advent of cauldrons, if everyone will be using from a communal store and you are no longer getting the benefit from duration, then it's likely that some alchs will drop the skill for something that makes more money (currently herbs are far too expensive on my server, and flasks go for less than the material price so you can't make money)<br />
<br />
As to the inherent problem of flask cost, well that will be fixed by simply doubling the number of flasks that are made.</div></div><hr />

A 10-man raiding guild raiding fifteen hours a week would have to make enough to have everyone fully flasked for over three years of raiding. That's almost two expansions on from now. &quot;Just sell them&quot; isn't an answer; because you would ruin the market value unless you were selling like 100-150 a week (in which case, enjoy selling those flasks for almost five years).<br />
<br />
Happy to see most of the raid changes seem to be fixes to ways to cheese encounters. A shame DMs got such a nerfing. The spinning-death part of the gauntlet event is(/was) one of my favourite parts of Cata thus far.</div></div><hr />

The same 2 questions I have. I am an Alch does that mean 3 hr flasks now? Or 2.5 or 1.5?<br />

<br />
This was driving me nuts, so I'm glad they put that in there. It's funny how the little things slowly drive you insane. Only 400 rep from dailies for the Ramkahen? That's not a huge deal even though it means without the tabard (and any bonuses) it'll take you around 70 days to get Exalted. But no mailbox? Ay caramba!</div></div><hr />

Int flask is better regen than spirit for druid, on top of actually providing increased throughput.</div></div><hr />

The H-Deadmines change seems to be more for length issues than any kind of nerfing. This isn't vanilla, the design for 5-mans have changed. Blizzard even stated at one point their goal in length of 5-mans, which I believe was around an hour or so for appropriately geared groups. While I haven't personally ran H-Deadmines yet, I have read about it taking 2+ hours for appropriately geared groups, which is too long for how Blizzard wanted it. Reducing the trash, which shouldn't provide too much of a challenge in the first place, is a great way to do it without actually nerfing the place.</div></div><hr />

That would be nice to know..with the big Version @ lvl 22 &quot;Finally, at guild level 22, you'll earn an improved version of Chug-A-Lug, which increases the duration of Flasks of Battle by 100%, bringing it up to 2 hours.&quot; Alch Chars should have 4h Flasks ? If not our profession Bonus ist just fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only other guild profession achievement that needs to be nerfed is the Glyph one. All the other achievements are doable, if not over a few months, but with the current design of glyphs it's completely pointless to craft 25,000 glyphs. Right now there is about 350 glyphs in the game, so that would be about 3.5 stacks of every glyph in the game, and would completely fill 700 characters glyph tabs if they had no glyphs. Considering most pre-cata toons filled up their glyphs before the xpac came out, and the price of herbs to make the inks, you'd probably sell/use all 25,000 in 6 months. This is ignoring any competing guilds also making that many glyphs to get the achievement themselves, as well as the toons making glyphs as part of their usual AH profits. With that competition you may sell/use all those glyphs by the time the next xpac comes out. Also, because of the current price of herbs being up 3X more expensive then selling the glyphs on some servers, most scribes would just farm the herbs and sell them rather than mill. <br />
<br />
To sum it up, no guild in their right mind would even think about wasting the time/money to craft that many glyphs for a net profit loss, 100s of man hours wasted etc. Now, if it was reduced to 2,500 glyphs, or even 5,000 glyphs, guilds would consider the achievement.</div></div><hr />

Level your own alchemist and get your own herbs, it's not hard. I can farm up enough materials for Titanic Strength flasks in about 30 minutes. Or farm mats after raid for a little bit, most players are either in raid or have logged off so there is less competition. The worst material to farm for making flasks in my opinion is Whiptail since all you got is the swamp in Tol Barad and Uldum. But Cinderbloom, Stormvine and Azshara's Veil are a joke to farm for the other flasks. Since you really don't need to have a character above 83 to get those mats and really should just have the Abyssal Seahorse unless you have a druid, you should have no problems getting them.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, it isn't hard. IMO, though, this adds more weight on the shoulders of raiders who are already maximizing their time allotted for playing. My main also has professions that I need to maintain in order to get optimal performance in raid. And one toon is already supporting my main as it is. All of this takes time to accomplish. I think I will probably move one of my alts off of another server and level alchemy that way. Still, my opinion remains: These mats are insane.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter, since the cauldron will have 30 flasks eventually, and will be used every 2 hours. Even if you have a 4 hr flask, all it means is that you don't click on the guild cauldron as often.</div></div><hr />
