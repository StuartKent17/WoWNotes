Upcoming PvP Balance Changes<br />
Now that Patch 7.1 has been available for a little while, we’ve been able to identify several changes to PvP tuning we’d like to make. We’d like to share those changes with you in advance, along with some developer insight. All of the following changes will only apply in PvP, and while some of them are still being tested, our goal is for all of them to go live with scheduled weekly maintenance.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#ZAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#Y))<br />
<br />
(Frost) Strength in PvP has been reduced by 10%.<br />
(Unholy) Apocalypse damage is no longer reduced in PvP (was reduced by 75%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: Frost Death Knights have recently received a number of bug fixes and class tuning adjustments that have pushed their damage out of line in PvP. For Unholy, Apocalypse’s damage was reduced during beta due to its burst potential, but due to other changes, we no longer feel that reduction is necessary.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idemonhunters.gif Demon Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/358-Demon-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/demon-hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#w) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#xAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#w))<br />
<br />
(Havoc) Agility increased by 5%.<br />
(Havoc) Stamina increased by 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: As players have become more accustomed to Demon Hunters and how to counter them, we feel their damage and general survivability has ended up a little low, so we’re giving them a little tuning to help them compete.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#NAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#M))<br />
<br />
(Survival) Stamina has been increased by 15%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: As a melee DPS, Survival Hunters have been a bit too squishy in PvP, so we’re increasing their Stamina.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#hAAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#g))<br />
<br />
(Frost) Intellect has been reduced by 10%<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: Frost Mages recently received some damage increases that we feel need to be counter-tuned in PvP.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#p) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#o))<br />
<br />
(Windwalker) Agility has been reduced by 10%.<br />
(Windwalker) Serenity now increases damage by 25% with the Spiritual Focus artifact trait (was +30%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: Windwalkers are able to maintain an extremely high uptime against their targets in PvP, and their raw damage capability was just too high for a spec that’s so difficult to get away from. <br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Lava Burst (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/51505) now deals full damage in PvP (was reduced by 80%). (Elemental) Control of Lava increases Lava Burst damage by 100% (was 150%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: We’ve received a lot of feedback that Elemental Shaman feel good in PvP once they have access to the Honor Talent Control of Lava, but felt too weak without it. We’ve decided to remove the PvP reduction on the base Lava Burst spell and reduce the benefit from Control of Lava to compensate. This results in effectively the same damage for players who still wish to use Control of Lava, but an increase to Lava Burst without it.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#F) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#E))<br />
<br />
Hamstring (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1715) damage has been increased considerably, and now lasts for 12 seconds in PvP.<br />
(Arms) Strength and Stamina increased by 10%.<br />
(Fury) Strength and Stamina increased by 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: Patch 7.1 put Hamstring back on the global cooldown, and while we still feel that that’s the correct choice for that ability, we understand that this change had a major impact on PvP Warriors’ damage rotation, as well as Hamstring’s overall uptime. To compensate, we’ve increased Hamstring’s duration so that it needs to be applied less frequently, and massively increased its damage to help make it feel worthwhile to use. Additionally, we felt that Warriors weren't feeling quite tough enough in PvP, so we’ve increased Strength and Stamina for Arms and Fury.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#lAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#k))<br />
<br />
(Destruction) Entrenched in Flame duration reduced to 3 seconds (was 4 seconds). (Destruction) Focused Chaos now increases Chaos Bolt damage by an additional 100% (was 150%).<br />
(Destruction) Shadowburn now deals 20% less damage in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: 7.1 introduced some new talents to Destruction Warlocks to increase their control and incentivize the use of cast time spells like Chaos Bolt. These talents were overtuned initially, but we want to keep Chaos Bolt as the best damage value for a Soul Shard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.Net Appear Offline Update<br />
We got another update on the Appear Offline feature (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236761-appear-offline-option-coming-soon-to-battlenet/) today!<br />
We would like to add an &quot;Appear Offline&quot; option to Overwatch. We are in the process of coordinating this with Battle.net and the other game teams. Because our social system is a cross-game system (WoW, Hearthstone, Heroes, SC2, D3) adding this functionality is not trivial for us. I know there has been discussion around this feature for a long time, and things have definitely not moved at a rate which is acceptable, I can assure you we care about the feature and want to figure out how to make it happen.<br />
<br />
For your particular issue regarding invites, you can go into the Social Options menu and turn off invites.<br />
<br />
Thanks for being patient with us.<br />
<br />
Thank you for this. I was wondering if/when this would be added.<br />
I wish I had a definitive &quot;when&quot; to provide. Hopefully a decent first step is just knowing that we aren't opposed to the idea and want to embrace it.<br />
<br />
<br />
BlizzCon Check-In!<br />
Hey everyone!<br />
<br />
With our 10th BlizzCon (CRAZY) just mere days away, I thought it would be a good time to do a check-in to see who from the forums will be at the Con!<br />
<br />
Members of the Blizzard Entertainment Community Team will be in attendance at the Darkmoon Faire on the 3rd floor of the Anaheim Convention Center (map here (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/attendees/floor-map)) on both Friday and Saturday. <br />
<br />
Myself, Rythmor, Aerya, and Kaivax, among many others, will be in attendance at the Darkmoon Faire. You'll be able to identify us through our Blizzard Blue (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/4U73TEB81G2W1477507674145.png) &quot;CMTY Team (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/U52T7U5ZIYZM1477507674096.png)&quot; shirts. Stop by have a chat, take pictures, trade-pins, and say hello!<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to welcoming everyone to sunny southern California, and we can't wait to kick off BlizzCon 2016!<br />
<br />
For those not in attendance, make sure to catch all the BlizzCon action through the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket, which will give you a front row seat to all the epic entertainment from the comfort of your own home! <br />
<br />
You’ll get comprehensive coverage of both days of the show, including panels, contests, interviews, and the closing ceremony, along with some cool commemorative in-game goodies. You can even stream the convention using the free BlizzCon Guide mobile app!<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
You should be able to queue for battlegrounds with more than one healer in the party now. Let us know if you still encounter the problem. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/791690175810113536))<br />
<br />
Mounts<br />
hey, can you tell us if Rockspine Basilisk mount is already in the game? Cause he's not appearing in my journal...<br />
not available yet, sorry! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/791747126359273472))<br />

Dark Legacy Comics #558 - Class Balance<br />
DLC #558 (http://darklegacycomics.com/558) has been released!<br />

<br />
Frost DK is currently overperforming at a level to which only the former Assassination and current Windwalker are comparable: Strength nerfed 10%<br />
<br />
There needs to be more rhyme and reason when an intern is loosed from their cage to hammer away some buffs &amp; nerfs on Celestalon and Holinka's computers. This is why Blizzard's forum moderators feel like they're drowning in complaints.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know that people can choose the talent to increase health by 10%. Not just frost but other classes can have the extra 10% choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The truth is sims show things under specific conditions. The alternative to sims is relying on logs. When we did that Blizzard threw a shit fit and said &quot;but tops players play X and not Y! You can't trust logs because of that!!!!&quot;. Because Blizzard has consistently failed to provide a better option than sims and logs, this really falls on them.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between &quot;let's worry about 0.01%&quot; and &quot;this spec performs at 70% of the top spec&quot;. I think people often forget this and that there's more to WoW than raw dps on a single target fight.<br />
<br />
This is entirely excluding everything outside of raw dps such as survivability and CC's (often used for questing or PvP).<br />
<br />
There's a huge difference between leveling my bal druid and my warlock. There's a huge difference between leveling my DH/WW and my ret (at the start of the expansion). My ele shaman? Yeah... at 102 I decided to go enh and it made a world of difference -- I'm not exaggerating. It went from &quot;holy fuck this is stupid&quot; to &quot;wow, this isn't so bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have all classes. I have a pretty good feel for most of them and inside of them, about half the specs. No particular reason -- I just get bored sometimes and want to do something different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You honestly expect sympathy while you're playing Protection Paladin in PvP? The biggest fucking aids that every set foot in Arena. Play Ret or Holy or another class, Prot has no place in PvP.</div></div><hr />

At this point, that post about appearing offline is just insulting, especially the part about this hopefully being a decent first step. Its not!

Yeah people know how to counter them : by outnumbering them, stunning and praying they dont unstun and laser people/jump everywhere lifestealing 4 hp bars. Its just that most of the time, we cant.<br />
I was excepting the reverse for the burst lifestealing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing stopping you from doing that, even if the offline feature is added? I'll take my 1 button command to be all alone and not having to repeat the same line X times a day, like I do too often when I play D3/Overwatch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and how do you want tab targeting to work? cause thats the issue, do you want it to be the closest target? one your facing? one closest to the middle of the screen, one furthest away? one with most health? least health? pets? no pets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish all PVPers would follow suit. People who rely on WOW for PVP, QUIT. CANCEL YOUR SUB. THIS GAME SUCKS FOR PVP. JUST STOP. For everyone else, it's awesome. Keep on keepin' on. If at any point you feel like doing some PVP, spool up a game of Settlers of Catan, or perhaps Chess. The time spent to amount of fun had ratio will be way higher than with World of Warcraft. If you do not have enough friends for either of those activities, you have just defined a goal to work towards.</div></div><hr />

Of course man, Warlocks will always be last in DPS when everyone is balanced!<br />

God, that DLC made my day. ;D</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
Seriously Blizzard?!?!?!?! <br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Notes: As players have become more accustomed to Demon Hunters and how to counter them, we feel their damage and general survivability has ended up a little low, so we’re giving them a little tuning to help them compete. <br />
<br />
This is what you're going with?!?!?!?! Have you even played the game recently?!?!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to create an account just for you - You don't think a 1 million damage Chaos bolt was a bit much? People were getting 2 shot by warlocks before they even knew what the hell hit them...<br />
<br />
Destruction is still strong with the nerfs here - Theese nerfs were needed to balance out a bit - I play a warlock myself and has done so for 8 years - Destruction PvP is finally viable in PvP - No more boring af safe affliction where you just stand there and wait with no burst..<br />
<br />
I hope you'll still be a part of the destruction warlocks! :)</div></div><hr />

1m dmg happened only if lot of stars aligned.... it was nearly impossible to pull of in arenas, my average hit with chaos bolt in instnacied PvP with ilvl 850 was around 620k and considering how low chance was to pull one off (considering low, looow mobility and shitload of pillars and response skills) I found firestone build to be superior for arenas while most locks around high rating are using cremation build, maybe you should stop considering random battlegrounds as balance point, thank you. Focused chaos WAS useless for serious PvP BEFORE this nerf, issue is now with shadowburn nerf whole frakking destro is useless.</div></div><hr />

That reading skill. You don't even need to do the maths, they explained the change just below. The spec felt bad without X talent. They buffed base damage and nerfed the talent. Buff for everyone without the talent and nothing change for those that have it.<br />
<br />
And people wonder why they don't listen to player when the average lack the reading skill of a first grade?</div></div><hr />

At this point, that post about appearing offline is just insulting, especially the part about this hopefully being a decent first step. Its not! You told us it was coming soon, in the next expansion, FOUR years ago. That first step has sailed. Implement it or just keep your mouth shut about it.<br />
<br />
Yep.<br />
<br />
Hey Blizz, bring back countershot and traps for BM hunters.<br />
<br />
Jerks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farabee</div><div class="date">2016-11-01, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Blizzard, how about you dumpster this whole &quot;class fantasy&quot; bullshit where DKs of both specs hobble along the BG at 70% slow but happen to be able to kill things fast if they facetank our damage, and maybe give us some utility beyond Death Grip?<br />
<br />
The only reason you gave us ridiculous damage in the first place is because that's all we bring to the table. We can't run flags, we can't survive for more than 10 seconds without cooldowns, we can't peel when every other melee can basically spam short-range teleport (literally EVERY OTHER melee, name a class and I'll name a mobility cooldown or two). So giving us mongoloid damage for a week and then taking it away isn't going to get people to stick to the class, it's just going to have FOTM rerollers pick it up and screw up ladder for a week and then abandon it soon after.</div></div><hr />

but it wasnt critting even close to a million ? biggest crit i've seen so far was 700k and that was in a bg with berserker. i think you're thinking of glacial spike, cuz i get 1m+ crits all the time on my mage, and the build up is VERY short on that...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shudder</div><div class="date">2016-11-01, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and how do you want tab targeting to work? cause thats the issue, do you want it to be the closest target? one your facing? one closest to the middle of the screen, one furthest away? one with most health? least health? pets? no pets?<br />
<br />
Closest that I'm facing would be nice like it was in cata before they broke it and promised to fix it in the next patch. Closest facing would be 10 times better than what we have now which is a mob 20 yards behind me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twdft</div><div class="date">2016-11-01, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are they only trying to implement the offline feature for Overwatch or the client as a whole?<br />
<br />
My guess would be they start by having an option to only show up as online in the game you currently play.<br />
<br />
Easy fix for WoW alone would be to simply make the friend list cross realm like ignore already is.</div></div><hr />
