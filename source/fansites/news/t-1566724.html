Blizzard had their Q2 2014 earnings call today, announcing that WoW is down to 6.8 million subscribers. This is down 800k from the Q1 2014 call that listed WoW at 7.6 million subscribers. 
 
 
There was a decline in subscribers quarter over quarter, which was disproportionately concentrated in the East and was similar to the seasonal decline experienced during the second quarter of 2012, prior to the launch of the most recent expansion later that year.

<br />
the sub numbers are very misleading though because Asian servers can buy access for 1 hour rather than 1 month, so its almost impossible to determine how many of those subs are 1 month+ subscribers, one thing we can do though is say its less than 6.8million, probably around 3-4million actual concurrent subscribers.</div></div><hr />

The number is pretty tragic when you consider WoW had over 12million subscribers at one point.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baneleaf</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just relax because the expansion launch date will be announced in 9 days and should be out by very late September or early October. There are so many people that have unsubbed waiting for warlords it is not funny. Hell my guild has had at least 15% of our players unsub and just play Diablo or Hearthstone. I would be interested to see how those numbers go up and down as WoW subs go up and down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's with all the wotlk love as of late.. wotlk seems to be still fresh in my mind i can remember people complaining that raids were too easy, lfd destroying the community, that the content lul was way too long, that ruby sanctrum was boring, northrend had too much snow, gearscore was alive and well, dalaran lagged, too many rep grinds for enchants, naxxx is reused etc etc</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Polarthief</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And everyone called me crazy when I said we'd see some massive spikes down if WoD continues to be late.<br />
<br />
Q3 prediction: ~5.5M or less (assuming WoD comes in Q4, which would be October)<br />
Q4 prediction: ~7M or more (due to WoD, obviously)</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I personally went away because there's absolutely no content apart from achievements that I don't care about.<br />
<br />
But you know what really pisses me off? Blizzards inability to fix my server - it has been a ghost town for years now and they've done nothing. According to various WoW population sites, it's one of the lowest in EU and absolutely fucking nothing was done to even try to fix it. <br />
<br />
I guess money from people migrating away from it was more than people who quit. Just shows how little Blizzard values their long term customers. Absolutely not at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tisane</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not someone who defends Blizzard's subs-decline by coming up with several excuses and that everything will be better later on again, but I definitely blame this one on the lack of content for almost a year now. I'm still subbed, but there's nothing new or interesting to do still at this point. Just leveling up my alts for WoD a little bit every day and that's it. I suppose quite a few subs will return when WoD arrives, but I doubt it'll be a big amount. Maybe 2 mil max. No way we'll ever get back to the point of WotLK.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kryos</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- very old game (10 years) <br />
- no new content since September 2013<br />

I guess with WoD they will get back 1 million - but WoW will continue to decline. Old game is old.</div></div><hr />

It'll be 12 months come September, and it's expected that October will be the release, so it'll be 13 months. Blizzard fucked up (yet again) plain and simple. They just don't understand that these end-of-expansion dry periods are inexcusable.</div></div><hr />

Because everyone is fully aware of what's causing the sub dip. Anyone claiming &quot;WOW IS DYING&quot; is a moron. We've had no content for just about 12 months (another week will be a full year; 5.4 came out 9/10/13 and it's now 8/5/14), and that's simply unacceptable. We pay monthly for &quot;more content&quot;, so that $180 that everyone spent has been for nothing, PLUS, you have to pay an additional $50 for the expansion.<br />
<br />
So, y'know, it's a no-brainer why we've had a massive sub loss.</div></div><hr />

ESO and Wildstar were plagued with bugs and design flaws, I understand. MMO audiences these days are not forgiving of these. Making a polished, reliable, balanced MMO is frightfully difficult.<br />

Going forward, I expect WoW will face fewer (or no) new AAA MMO competitors. Too many people have been burned making them.</div></div><hr />

Except they misled us thinking that we'd have only a 6 month period (tops) of no content, which is usually the higher-end of a tier, because they actually had a very good track record with 5.2 and 5.4. Sadly, they fucked up royally here.<br />

The no content until WoD thing is fine, they're just taking way too long with WoD itself. 6.0 won't even come until September, and the pre-expansion patch lasts a full 4 weeks before the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Sort of agree with this. Subscription MMOs are a dying breed really... just like most computer gaming in general as things are moving more and more to casual and mobile. Obviously, there's reasons for WoW's subscription base dropping quickly in these quarter, but the overall downward trend is going to continue until it levels out at a sustainable level regardless of anything Blizzard do to the game. It's just the way the market is now, and the game is very old. But even the newer MMOs, as you say, seem to be struggling.</div></div><hr />

Especially considering the raid content from start to finish(aside from lasting too long) has been some of the best raiding content in WoW's history. The problem with the sub loss is they may not be savable. People saying it's only temporary are blind to the reality that WoD doesn't have a ton to offer in terms of content. With the recent changes to my class I am debating just hanging it up for good as I dont personally find the changes fun. <br />
<br />
WoW won't see 10 million subs back, they will be lucky to hit 9 million and honestly I think they will peak at about 8.5ishM before people realize how bad the content is so far in WoD. The damage is already done with no new content for close to a year and definitely exceeding that by a month to three months. Especially considering from Cata to MoP they stated they would release expansions faster so the end tier wouldn't last as long as it has the last two expansions(wotlk/cata). Then they go and pulled this crap. Lastly Celestalon talks to people so poorly that I am debating not supporting their main cash cow simply for the standard that just because you're at the top of the chain doesn't mean your customer service skills should go out the window. Something GC was good at was dealing with people even in the worst of times. Celestalon is just a massive douche bag that I don't want to put money towards his check, even though the D3 expansions will essentially help pay for that.</div></div><hr />

Content patches should not last for over a year. <br />

Q3 prediction: ~5.5M or less (assuming WoD comes in Q4, which would be October)<br />

You honestly think the next quarter will see a 1.3m or more sub loss? The chopper and pre patch will see that we wont. I don't see us falling below 6.3m before WoD. back up to 8+m for WoD.</div></div><hr />

Ive seen people say &quot;Casuals are where the money's at!&quot; and devs say &quot;You people consume content too fast&quot;. Content is dumbed down so dirty casuals can breeze through it. Then they get bored because new content isn't released every month. A drought of dumbed down content for the dirty casuals should have resulted in more subs lost.

They only stopped rising due to a content drought. Who knows what would have happened if the game had kept it's momentum going strong. <br />

As far as I'm concerned, it's time to put WoW isn't retirement and wrap things up. Stop trying to be innovative and new, that's only tanked your sub numbers. <br />

Starcraft and Diablo franchises have each individually been as profitable for Blizz as the Warcraft series, and in fact arguably much better considering they reached similar numbers in dramatically shorter time periods.<br />

no matter how many new raids you add it wont bring someone back who is simply tired of an mom and raiding. same can be said for pvp or pet battles or what have you. unless blizzard turns wow into a new type of game the only thing new content will do is stem the bleeding, and that's not a bad thing.

Oh it will rebound. It is certain there will be a big surge come WoD. But then, 2-3 months after there will be another large drop becouse lots of casuals will just play new xpack for a short while. The overall state can be determined by the long-term trend. Not by the xpack surges or large drops due to content droughts.</div></div><hr />

Was probably not a good idea to establish a precedent for pre-raid gearing to be easy over the course of a 4-yr period and then take that away from customers who had grown used to enjoying it. Only innovation I have appreciated from this expac has been CMs and cross-realm technology. The &quot;Legendary&quot; which is so legendary everyone not only has it - but is required to have it by any semi-competent gulid - and the pointless grinding during offhours of tasks that are not fun, I have to imagine those are the culprits. <br />

It depends on the variety the game offers and the quality. WoW can continue as long as they maintain a high level of quality and continue to inject new dimensions and angles to the game.

Ive seen people say &quot;Casuals are where the money's at!&quot; and devs say &quot;You people consume content too fast&quot;. Content is dumbed down so dirty casuals can breeze through it. Then they get bored because new content isn't released every month. A drought of dumbed down content for the dirty casuals should have resulted in more subs lost. I'm impressed it stayed this high.<br />
<br />
Im curious at the rate of content is consumed say now vs BC days.<br />
I loved how our guild was the majority of the way through T5 in BC at xpac end we felt accomplished. <br />

<br />
Letting this happen is a big mistake on Blizzard's part. When people leave for extended periods of time, they discover other things and the chances of them coming back and staying get lower and lower. Even if WoD gets a lot of initial buys from people coming back, it's already too late. Those people are no longer hooked on WoW, they've tasted the outside world and it will forever color their experience of the game.<br />
<br />
But I guess that's what Blizzard is banking on. They've continued to demonstrate that they're more interested in cashing-in then they are on the longevity of the title at this point (which, considering it's age, is no surprise). They'll get the flood of extra people who buy the WoD xpac at it's increased price, and then try to get them to spend extra on cash shop items (and maybe try to catch some wallets with a longer-term sub plan deals D3 style) before those players leave a couple months later.</div></div><hr />

The game is in a clear gradual decline since the top 2009-2011, which the expansions basically just temporarily offset and slow. In fact it would be pretty easy to extrapolate the graph out figuring in a bump of ~2 million for WoD followed by more gradual decline. I've played in the beta and it's looking great but there isn't a game changing feature in it that will bring 5M subs back. Wow is unique though in that I think there is a floor to the graph. Wherever that floor point is (2M? 3M? 5M?) it will be down to the really hardcore subs that simply aren't ever going to unsub until Blizz pulls the plug or completely stops development.</div></div><hr />

the biggest problem with content droughts, like the gigantic one there is currently, is while some people will come back many people will not. and that's where you lose subs. don't keep people engaged with content and they will look elsewhere for their entertainment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
800k is a misleading number. Much more people than that have unsubbed in the last 3 months. 800k is only the difference between those who unsubbed and those who resubbed. The unsub exodus more than likely contained a lot of veteran players or those who play a lot. The truth is, 2 million could have unsubbed, but 1.2 million also resubbed. The majority of the player base is very casual, often just quest by themselves and don't talk to anymore, so servers would appear to be more empty than they actually are.</div></div><hr />

While not entirely current (about 8 months since their last update), http://mmodata.blogspot.com/ does have the information you desire. From the looks of it, MMOs peaked several years ago and have slowly gone down. My opinion is that's likely due to other game options, especially free ones, that offer a similar social interaction on top of several MMOs released in the past few years that have failed to progress the genre enough to maintain peoples' interest.<br />
<br />
The only still steadily increasing MMO is EVE Online, and as much of a niche game it is I wouldn't consider it a good example.</div></div><hr />

It depends on the variety the game offers and the quality. WoW can continue as long as they maintain a high level of quality and continue to inject new dimensions and angles to the game.

<br />
admittedly pvp almost always outlasts pve due to its far greater range of options in the first four moves of a chess game you can have 318,979,564,000 results, thats why it stays relevant even if only 1% of those are actually ligament and interesting games you can almost never see them all.

WoW is still by far the strongest MMO that has ever been, even at these numbers and I'm sure that we'll return back up to 8 million or so when WoD comes out. At the same time, why the fuck do we care how many subscribers WoW has.</div></div><hr />

This is nothing but me talking, but I really think they delayed it because of Destiny in September.<br />
<br />
But if that is not the case, I really think they need to clean house with some of the upper management of WOW. There are clearly too many cooks in the kitchen and no reason that content is this slow coming out for such a big team. I really think the problems is that they have just promoted too many people and created too many ´middle managers´ who don´t contribute actual content to the game and actually get in the way. Like with the character models, it seems like you only have a handful of people actually working on them, but then 10 layers of managers who all have the power to kick the finished product back to the artists.<br />
<br />
it is what happened with Microsoft and is happening with Google. You just promote too many people to middle-management positions who do nothing but justify their jobs by delaying the pipeline to ´make things right´...</div></div><hr />

Most of WoW's subs are in the east (china, korea etc..) and have always been. The west make up a small part of the total subs. In addition to that I highly doubt they would lie about the sub numbers given that they don't release them for the public. They release them for investors because they are required to by law. Lying about them would make them guilty of fraud and someone would be facing jail time. Don't think Blizzard would make that trade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can only be new once. If you had told anyone in the industry 10 years ago that WoW would pass 10 million subs they would have called you a liar. If you told them that in 10 years it would still have nearly 7 million subs, they sure as hell would of thought you were nuts. Most MMO's essentially run out of steam around year 4 or 5, they fact they are even remotely holding it together at year 10 is just nuts.</div></div><hr />

Not that I'm looking forward to 6.0 really, my Druid will be losing half his spells. I think people are in for a shock. I've always heard of 'not changing too much what people are used to with a game' as a good design philosophy. Will be interesting to see how the community react to this massive overhaul. It's the kind of thing GC always seemed dead against, and with him gone a certain faction seem to be pulling the strings now...<br />
<br />
Technically they did deliver on the promise of speeding up patches. We received a major patch every few months in MoP, alternating between raid content and dailies/catch up content. The expansion taking this long doesn't apply, in my opinion, because an expansion is separate from a patch. I think they likely bit off more than they could chew with WoD, but it'll be interesting to see if they continue the patch schedule they had in MoP.</div></div><hr />

Well and I think thats part of the reason why you see numbers drop, but profits all that much.

<br />
This is not true. Back in WOTLK, it was 50-50% but every time WOW has lost subscribers since then, they always say that it was mostly from the east. When they lost 1.2M one quarter, they said it was almost entirely from the east. Right now, the split is probably largely in favor of West ( $15/month) which is why revenues have barely moved even though subscribers have dropped by almost 50%. At most, the east probably makes up 30% of accounts right now. If WOW was losing western subscribers, revenues would have fallen off a cliff, and they haven´t.<br />

TBH my guess is the most of the major investors already know the game is headed down, what they are interested in is it still being run properly, making as much profit as it can, and does Blizzard have another income stream to make up for it. TBH the announcing of a Titan cut was probably more concerning to the investors than the WoW numbers.<br />

<br />
...900k subs! it's...under 1 mil?<br />
<br />
at some point, blizzard needs to admit &quot;hey, we keep fucking up&quot;. if you don't innovate, or keep fucking over customers with long content droughts, that is how you lose subs. also, i'm not sure a &quot;filler&quot; xpac like pandaland was a good idea. ironically, they lost business in china, the xpac that this was pandering to (no pun intended).<br />
<br />
I don't think you get the point sir. The game is 10 years old. There's no video game in history that ever hold so many players for so much time. So there's no way you can say for certain that the decline has anything to do with Blizzard fucking up, or that a amazing video game has a unavoidable decline. Because there's is simply no previous example of this.<br />
<br />
That being said, it doesn't mean it is NOT a sign that Blizzard is fucking up the game. It just doesn't prove anything. When you think about it, WoW, as a RPG game, never innovated, really, WoW is WoW, my brother started playing this game in WoTLK, and like it alot, but when he got into Cata, he just said, well, that's just the same game, and I just want to go play new games on Steam. Some people are just not that into playing the same game for 10 years, surely you can't hope that the 13 millions that played this game are all into it.<br />
<br />
You've got to realize that WoW got so popular back at the end of TBC and at launch of WoTLK that it could very well just be that players that never played MMOs before just wanted to have a look at what this whole AMAZING game was about. 1 Expansion later, most of these people were like: that was pretty cool, let's move on... That was it for my brother and all his friends, they never logged since ICC, 8 of them.<br />
<br />
Just enjoy the game while it last. We don't know, maybe it will last 10 years, 3 years, 2. All I know is that no video game in history was able to hold so many players for so long. And there if the servers keeps up in 20 years, there will still be a few players playing, just like there's people playing Nintendo 8bit Super Mario Bros. As good as mario 1 is, you can't expect every console players to stick to Mario forever, even if Mario was ultimately the BEST GAME that could ever exist. People wants to move to new things sometimes.<br />
<br />
I know I will switch to whatever new MMO blizzard make, unless it's a F2P with Pay 2 win crap like they are starting to make Heroes of the Storm end up.</div></div><hr />

Because they are not losing the $15/month subscribers, they are losing the guys in china that were paying $1 per month who are now playing f2p games.<br />
<br />
There is no panic because anyone with half a brain can read the numbers and what Blizzard is saying. Just like back when WOW had 12M subscribers but 505 were from china, everyone knew that WOW only really had 6M ´profitable´ subscribers.</div></div><hr />

There is so much MMO releasing every year that it's not surprising WoW keep losing subscriptions. Most known as SW:ToR, ESO, Wildstar, Guild Wars 2 are around 1 million each. There's also Tera, Aion, Rift, The Secret World, Lineage, Final Fantasy XIV,etc that also have a good player base. There is Archage, Everquest Next, and some other incoming MMO.<br />

They say the exact same thing every single time they announce a huge sub loss. It is nothing more than damage control. I don't know anyone who plays or has played that hasn't been impacted by the sub losses in some way, and that is on US servers. No matter how hard they try to spin the losses every time as &quot;Nothing to worry about, it is just losses in the East again&quot;, the players actually feel the impact of the losses. <br />
<br />
Those loss numbers are slanted towards the least profitable market, because it is easier for investors to digest losses from less profitable regions.</div></div><hr />

Right now, just to prep for Warlords of Draenor if you're brand new, you pay 20 for standard, 20 for MoP, and 50 for WoD. 90$ for 1 month of game time, and a free 90. If you wait until WoD launches, you'll get everything for free up to WoD, and you're still looking at 10$ more than the average game for 1 month.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest problem is simply cost. I think if they lowered it to 10$ a month, and added some more cool visual shit for 3-5$ to the store, while also making it to where you get Classic to WoD for 40 to 50$, it would be great. <br />
<br />
Only brand new accounts with no tied in battle.net account will get a free 90. I dunno, just seems like they are having some problems getting new players in, and older players don't want to return for 70$. It's just not a good deal if you're a returning player. You are level 60, 70, have to pay to get MoP, then you don't want to level the 30 levels, so you pay another 50 for the 90. The value just isn't there and I think Blizzard needs to take a cold hard look at the actual numbers of the game. People will pay for subscriptions if they feel like they are getting value out of it. 10$ a month is a good value, and could be considered a movie ticket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pandaria was great because it was a bullshit expansion with a distant storyline nobody cared about thus allowing many longtime veterans of the warcraft franchise a breather to pursue other games.<br />
<br />
and its not like the game is going to still seem old and stale, with the character skins and probably some heavy modifications to just about everything implemented in the prior expansion (will admit ive read nothing about the expansion as I dont want to know anything about it before i experience it.)</div></div><hr />

And they just had the biggest prize money tournament of all time, for dota2. All i'm saying is Blizzard needs to learn from their mistakes. Try to innovate, don't just do more of the same. IMO the biggest problem with the game right now is the time between new content patches. Give people more reasons to log in, don't just make something new every 8-12 months.<br />

dota 2 is not dota.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no panic because anyone with half a brain can read the numbers and what Blizzard is saying. Just like back when WOW had 12M subscribers but 505 were from china, everyone knew that WOW only really had 6M ´profitable´ subscribers.<br />
<br />
Ah, the never ending &quot;All the losses are in China!&quot; claim. If subscribers (really, time-buyers) in China are less valuable to investors and stockholders, yet make up a majority of the subscription losses, why does Blizzard merge subscription numbers for East and West? Surely, they'd want to point out how many of those &quot;valuable&quot; Western subscribers they still have?</div></div><hr />

they can no longer let the genre/industry be shaped around them, instead they need to shape the game around the industry.<br />
<br />
let us face it, it is a fact that it is going to be very very hard to gain subs in short period (1-2 quarters), they will have to do drastic changes to shape their game around the industry (fast content, cheaper/f2p model etc..)</div></div><hr />

There is so much MMO releasing every year that it's not surprising WoW keep losing subscriptions. Most known as SW:ToR, ESO, Wildstar, Guild Wars 2 are around 1 million each. There's also Tera, Aion, Rift, The Secret World, Lineage, Final Fantasy XIV,etc that also have a good player base. There is Archage, Everquest Next, and some other incoming MMO.<br />

It's dying, yes, in the same way you and every human being on the planet is dying. WoW is dying, it will die eventually. But imminently? I don't think they'll be pulling the plug tomorrow morning or anything.<br />
<br />
Not sure why people have to keep saying &quot;WoW is dying!&quot; over and over, like they have been since WotLK. Of course it is. Nobody, not even the most deluded fanboy would ever think the game can go &quot;forever&quot; :P</div></div><hr />

Well technically Dota2 is as close a copy of Dota as possible. But I think Moradim's comparison isn't very good or fair. Dota doesn't have a content replayability problem like MMO's tend to have.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Souflikar</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, so we haven't seen new content in a very long time. And yes, WOW is a game that's been around for a long time. But the fact remains, since it's peak, WOW has lost 5.7 million subs. No expansion will bring it back to the &quot;Glory Days&quot;. Though there are small increases here and there, overall, the game numbers are dropping. The sub revenue is almost half of what it once was. And I know other game subs come no where close to WOW subs. However, you can't compare other games because WOW has ALWAYS stood alone. So that argument is a bit invalid. I wish it were different as I've loved the game since the beginning and would really like to see those crazy numbers again. But I have to admit, it's a definite decline. I think Blizz made a HUGE mistake with the no new content approach and other decisions they have made. I think they could have kept the numbers much higher. But even then, even if we had lots of new content, the decline would persist. Nonetheless, even though I don't play nearly as much as I once did, I still enjoy playing the game. I'm not really sure how the business end works with a game. However, I do know if I were an investor, I wouldn't look at the small increase spikes. I would CERTAINLY notice the overall declining graph as a risky investment.</div></div><hr />

Hardcore gamers are a better long-time investment since they are more likely to stick around. People in raiding guilds form friendships and stay for them. PvP people look forward to each season for another chance to come out on top. Professional gold makers want to watch the money roll in. Achievement hunters... well they want to catch them all. Which of these 4 groups of people is Blizzard targeting? Answer: none.<br />
<br />
Raiding isn't challenging enough and can be blazed through in a month, even by a new guild. PvP balance is neglected at worst. Professions are getting zero content, making the economic portion of the game boring, achievement hunters are getting stupid stuff like &quot;farm archaeology for a month&quot;.<br />
<br />
Instead the so-called &quot;casuals&quot; are getting bazillion of content for them to &quot;enjoy&quot;. Guess what, running SoO for the 100th time to get that LFR gear with no skill, no strategy and no communication isn't fun and won't make people form bonds. Getting boosted to top gear in 1 week won't make people get invested. Right now WoW is dominated by these faceless players who don't communicate, don't learn and don't invest: they play WoW like a single player game. And single player games don't last long.</div></div><hr />

it doesnt matter if numbers go up for one quarter (launch), if they all quit a few months later. many people who quit will never come back, also. even if this 6.8 mil goes to 10 mil at launch, what good is it if the subs drop to 4 mil later on?</div></div><hr />

yes, but when WOW had 12mil subs, there weren't nearly as many other MMOs out there as there are today.</div></div><hr />

Vacation<br />
Good weather<br />
A lot of players are taking a break from WoW until Warlords of Draenor gets out<br />
<br />
Love these excuses people come up with as to why the game is losing subscribers. I remember people saying &quot;It's too old, winter vacation, school's in session, school's out, economy is doing poorly so the game is doing poorly&quot; etc. It is never that the game is not as good as it used to be, people didn't like the direction the game is going. Always has to be some external factor as to why the subs drop, and couldn't possibly be something about the game. Oh no, the game is perfect.<br />
<br />
Next quarter it will be about 6 million even. Warlords of Draenor might get them 750k more and then will continue to drop. Cataclysm saw them lose 25%, Pandaria will be another 25% from their height. At this rate, the game actually will be practically dead during the expansion after Draenor.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't dead yet, but it is getting there. 4 more years and it very well could be. Blizzard must have done something really great between 2004 and 2010, and royally fucked up beginning with the release of Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

That's been the comment section so far :D<br />

It's been fun, want some popcorn?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkIron</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno why people are shocked or why people still think $15 a month is expensive.<br />
<br />
Face it, subs will go back up. People will come and go.<br />
<br />
$15 a month is less then what the average person spends on stupid things like coffee.<br />
<br />
$15 is cheaper then a night out, anywhere.<br />
<br />
People just want everything for free, that is actually the real issue. They assume server costs, employee costs, etc. cost nothing in the gaming world.<br />
<br />
These same people actually believe that free games are free and stupidly spend $100's of dollars on these products, but hey the initial cost was free right? To bad they drop a $1000 a year on these games and their terrible to begin with.<br />
<br />
Once people wake up and see the sub model is actually cheaper they'll be back.<br />
<br />
Till then they can play Hearthstone drop $50 on card pack multiple times and be happy cause the game was free. But hey $15 a month is to much too much.<br />
<br />
Oh and don't forget these same people wouldn't spend $50 on Hearthstone if they had to buy it out right and it included every single card, cause you know they you are 'buying' the game and its not free, but they'll happily spend $50 a month buying card packs. <br />
<br />
As long as I enjoy my game and play with my friends and continue to see the top guilds doing what they do, I don't really care what the people looking for handouts and free to play games are doing with their time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Averrix</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe, but how long will they stay? WoW almost never grew after Wotlk and I doubt this will change, the downward trend wont stop.<br />
<br />
Old game of not, this time Blizzard is to blame. You cannot leave people hanging for such a huge amount of time without any content.<br />
<br />
No, this long delay in content is really hurting them bad. They should of never cancelled the 5.5 patch with new content. As usual with a new expansion, people will come back, power level to max level and then quit again. Come back when a new major patch is out, quit again. They just want to see if there is anything new and fun worth staying for.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zervek</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope they continue to fall, and they will. I laugh at all the people who say the game isn't dying when they've almost lost another MILLION subscribers. Of course there will be the small spike of subs once WoD releases, but they will only fall even further after two months or so. I can't wait until they are down to at least 3 million.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when your subs continue to decline, that's bad. no signs of growth isn't good news.<br />
<br />
Bleeding subs isn't the &quot;Dying&quot; that people will make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Someone in the thread said &quot;lets add marks for all the other MMORPGS that have come and gone in WoW's 10 year life span&quot;. That's something I want to see</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Averrix</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So when will the graph hit 0?...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakesong</div><div class="date">2014-08-05, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it funny that people believe that those who quit due to content drouth will resub as soon as WoD hits. Most of them might but I think a lot of people will remember that Blizzard didn't put out ANY new content for almost a year. And they will most likely move on and WoW usually never recovers to these numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has no excuse for such a long period without any content.<br />
<br />
You are right, at the end of Cataclysm, after losing almost 3m players during the expansion, WoW had 9m players. By the start of MoP, WoW had 10m.<br />
<br />
Let's say WoW's sub numbers doesn't decline until the release of WoD (but rest assured it will), by the end of MoP, we have 6,8m players, by this logic, we can expect sub numbers to increase until 8m.<br />
<br />
It's just my opinion, but WoD doesn't seem very promissing, it's just more of the same we already had for the past years, and garrisons don't look much fun, i would rather have a real housing option. So, don't be alarmed if WoW doesn't reach 8m players back again.<br />
<br />
It's sad, but WoW is slowly dying. It won't drop from 6.8m to 500 players in a year, but we can expect the next 3 years to be very hard for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

In light of this table it makes a certain kind of sense. <br />
<br />
BTW is there actually any way of knowing the subs count at this moment?</div></div><hr />

No. We'll find out the Q3 end number in early November.</div></div><hr />

the number of active NA players. isn't it less than 1 million?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard did screw up on how long 5.4 is lasting, though. They should have slowed the pace of patches during MoP to reduce SoO's duration a bit.</div></div><hr />
