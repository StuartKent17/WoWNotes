Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator Clarifications<br />
I cannot overstate how much we appreciate all of the feedback we get. We spend a lot of time reading it all, and compiling it, and sharing it between teams here. Nonetheless, if the measurement of successful feedback is that the developers implement a suggested idea, then expectations are too high.<br />
<br />
We are going to continue to work on all of the talent trees until Mists is released.<br />
<br />
What is being done with spell crit for DPS specs?<br />
Our baseline assertion is that all spells and abilities will crit for double damage. There are a few exceptions to this, such as Elemental shaman getting a 2.5x crit multiplier, but the default is 2x for everyone now.<br />
<br />
Yes, this means that Enhancement shaman spells and rogue Poisons will crit for double damage.<br />
<br />
Are all tanks across the board losing a taunt?<br />
We’re currently trying a design where no tanks have AE taunts, other than Mocking Banner (which we intend to be used more as a tool to redirect streams of adds to you).<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue))<br />
The new Shiv will apply concentrated effects of the active utility poison. Those effects are not included in the poison tooltips currently available on the calculator, but here are the current versions:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Crippling Poison – Reduces the target’s speed by 70% for 12 seconds.<br />
Mind-Numbing Poison – Increases the casting time of an enemy's next spellcast within 8 seconds by 100%.<br />
Wound Poison – Reduces the target’s healing received by 50% for 6 seconds.<br />
Leeching Poison – Instantly restores 5% of the Rogue’s health.<br />
Paralytic Poison – Roots the target in place for 4 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shiv can still proc poison normally when it's triggered.<br />
<br />
Also, for those who were curious, it's looking like it will be about a 3 second cast time to swap poisons in combat. So, you won't be flip flopping between poisons on a whim, but if it's really clutch to swap to a different poison, then it's not totally out of the question. <br />
<br />
So does this mean that Poisons will still be on the Spell Crit table? In other words, Agility will still not affect their chance to crit?<br />
No. Poisons crit chance will be based on your melee crit chance.<br />
<br />
Yeah they should take the stun off of the actual poison and swap it with this effect as the stun is really random.<br />
Well, yes. The random part is kind of important though.<br />
<br />
An additional controllable stun that's on a different DR would be excessive. On the other hand, if it's on the same DR as CS and KS then that's... not good. By putting the root on Shiv and leaving the stun on the poison stacking we avoid that entirely, and rogues get a sweet stun that's on the random proc DR instead.<br />
<br />
Despite the title of the thread (which I will callously change), we're interested in player feedback on the shiv change as a whole, though. So what do you think? <br />
<br />
Will the thrown weapon talents have a chance to apply one or both active poisons?<br />
We're not sure about this yet. It's more likely that we'll apply damage poisons than the non-lethal ones, especially in the case of Shuriken, because a fairly spammable ranged snare is probably too good.<br />
<br />
Sorry, guys. You can still use Shuriken + Deadly Throw though!<br />
<br />
If I have Deadly Brew, will Shiv amplify that Crippling Poison effect in addition to my active poisons?<br />
No. Deadly Brew isn't the same as having Crippling actually active.<br />
<br />
For clarification, how exactly do active poisons work? One lethal, one utility, both with potential to proc from both weapons?<br />
One Lethal, one Non-Lethal, and both poisons are effectively on both weapons. Whenever you land either a mainhand or off-hand strike, you have a chance to apply both your Lethal and Non-Lethal poison.<br />
<br />
How does poison proccing work now, and what does that mean for weapon speed.<br />
Poison procs are largely unchanged, except, y’know, for all poisons being percentage-based in the future. We’re looking to get rid of the &quot;fast 1.4 speed dagger&quot; thing. The plan is for offhand daggers to just be daggers and interchangeable with main hand daggers. So we're anticipating Assassination and Subtlety rogues will use 1.8/1.8 daggers for the most part, while Combat will use a 2.6 main hand and a 1.8 offhand dagger. I know some of you noticed a Main Gauche change, and the intention isn’t a nerf. If it needs adjustment, it’s important to remember that numbers are still in flux.<br />
<br />
On a separate note, while we don’t have an elegant system in place for it, we do know that a lot of Combat rogues want to at least have the appearance of dual wielding swords/axes/maces. There are a lot of hurdles, but maybe we’ll find a good way to deliver on that. No promises though! So, again, don’t get your hopes up too high.<br />
<br />
So, how about an offensive dispel using the shiv system (perhaps as an alternative to Mind Numbing)?<br />
It's something we might consider, but if too many people have access to an effect like that, then magic buffs are increasingly devalued, and that causes all kinds of problems. For example, something like Hand of Protection is cool, but significantly less meaningful if too many classes out there can remove it with a button press. So, we'll think about it, but don't get your hopes up.<br />
<br />
Is Mind Numbing nerfed, now that it won’t affect all casts for the duration?<br />
That's a bit of a misunderstanding. Base Mind-Numbing is unchanged and works as it does now. The new Shiv effect stacks on top of the base Mind-Numbing, and is more than triply effective on the single next spellcast.<br />
<br />
Any chance of a sweet UI element warning the rogue that he’s approaching 5 stacks of paralytic poison, or letting him know that it went off?<br />
Making it easier to track buffs and debuffs in the UI, including using the Spell Alert system, is something we're always looking at.<br />
<br />
Y U NERF CRIPPLING?<br />
Sadly, because it was too good -- which is pretty much the same reason anything ever gets nerfed. Basically, we're looking to chill out some of the passive, automatically-applied snares on some classes get because there's no real gameplay to them beyond just I touch you and you're snared.<br />
<br />
Crippling is an important tool though, and we didn't want to take it away entirely. By lowering the base snare and allowing Shiv to still apply the -70% form, snaring opponents or kiting other melee classes that also have snares becomes something you'll need to think about and manage.<br />
<br />
Is Crippling going to last 12 seconds in PVP now, instead of 8 seconds?<br />
Nay. PvP durations are capped at 8 (and nothing should break that rule), but PvP durations aren’t shown in the tooltips.<br />
<br />
Under the proposed system, it looks like it won’t be possible to take both Paralytic and Leeching Poison. Will we have to have to choose between Paralytic and Crippling?<br />
You can take both Paralytic and Leeching, but you'll be able to actively make use of one at a time. That said, switching poisons isn't necessarily impossible in the heat of combat -- the cast time on swapping will be fairly short.<br />
<br />
That said, we're taking a look at the decision involved in the current placement of the different Poison-related talents, and that's something we may reevaluate. Still early days yet – and that applies to everything in this list.<br />
<br />
But Daxx! RAWR RAIDING! What's this PvP nonsense?<br />
We'd like Shiv to be useful when raiding too, and increasing the availability of such effects makes it easier to design encounters that permit them to shine. It bears mentioning that, even now, the various Shiv effects could be useful in existing raid encounters. There’s no reason to expect that they couldn't be useful in Mists raid design too.<br />
<br />
Also, there's more to PvE than raiding. Just because a talent isn't useful when you're fighting Ultraxion doesn't mean it isn't useful in PvE at large. There's still leveling (remember, tier 1 talents should ideally be relevant and useful to a level 15 player!), outdoor dailies, the upcoming challenge modes, and more to consider.<br />
<br />
Sooooo… Does this mean that rogue damage might go up if we lose some control/mobility/survivability?<br />
We want rogue PvE damage to remain top-tier. But yes, if rogues end up with less control or mobility or survivability, and they have to choose among those areas, then that allows us to safely improve their damage potential in PvP while keeping the class balanced overall. <br />
<br />
Any chance you guys will consider making Wound a lethal poison?<br />
There's a chance, we'll have a look. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217608-shiv-changes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4062848040))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage))<br />
Fear not! Mages will still have all their Teleports and Portals. At this point, we decided to hide them from the talent calculator to reduce clutter.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;base mana regeneration&quot;? How does mana regen work for casters (or mages)?<br />
Healers get a significant amount of mana regeneration from Spirit, even during combat. Additionally, all mana users have a small amount of mana regeneration -- currently about 1% of maximum mana per second. With Invocation, that 1%/sec is removed. Things like Innervate will still allow you to regenerate mana, but you won’t passively regenerate any with Invocation.<br />
<br />
What is the range for Alter time concerning the &quot;moves too far away&quot; part?<br />
100 yards. It’s mostly just to indicate that it won’t reverse taking a portal to Dalaran or something.<br />
<br />
Is AM a proc?<br />
Yes, Arcane Missiles is still activated via a proc from your other direct damage spells.<br />
<br />
Does Arcane Bomb have a target limit? <br />
Currently, no. We’re hoping it won’t be needed.<br />
<br />
Invisibility and Greater Invisibility say that you’re “untargettable”. Does that mean that we’re not actually invisible anymore?<br />
No, you still turn invisible, just it has been. It still breaks on damage. You still are completely cleared of threat when you turn invisible (either after 3sec for Invisibility, or instantly for Greater Invisibility).<br />
<br />
For Rune of Power, if the mage has two already out will we be able to cast another one or do we have to wait till the first one is gone?<br />
Casting a third will replace the first. This is similar to how Wild Mushrooms works for druids right now. By the way, two Runes of Power will not stack.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior))<br />
Traditionally AE threat is hardest to maintain for warriors, how will this carry forward in MOP?<br />
Thunder Clap is free for Protection warriors, and it applies a dot. Shield Slam and auto attack to generate rage for Shield Block.<br />
<br />
Most other offensive attacks are free (for Protection), except for Heroic Strike and Cleave, which are intended to be used only in times of excess rage (which should be less common than today, but still occur with reasonable frequency).<br />
<br />
Improving tanking rotations is always challenging. If tanks have too many abilities to manage, then they are overwhelmed in fights that require a lot of boss positioning or add management. If tanks have too few abilities or a very simplified resource, then they get bored on single-target boss fights with limited movement.<br />
<br />
Part of our design intent is to have tank resources tie into survivability instead of threat, since we (and tanks) place more emphasis on the former.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest))<br />
The intent of Spirit Shell is to provide a frequent-use absorb that recreates some of the gameplay where Disc priests put absorbs on lots of their teammates. This was a style many Disc priests told us they enjoyed, but was difficult to balance with Power Word: Shield (since PW:S is instant).<br />
<br />
At this point, think of Spirit Shell as Heal and Power Word: Shield as Flash Heal.<br />
<br />
Evangelism is a spec spell for both Holy and Disc (at least for the moment – things could still change). The talent calculator appears to be incorrect on this. Shadow has Dark Evangelism.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight))<br />
But we loved Corpse Explosion!<br />
Yes. You do. So do we. Unfortunately, requiring a corpse felt like too steep a requirement for a competitive talent. We would like to still add Corpse Explosion in some form as a glyph. In the meantime, hey presto! - Unholy Blight is back.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin))<br />
There are some incorrect mana costs displayed in the talent calculator for some Protection and Retribution Paladins spells right now. For example, Consecration actually costs 7% of base mana, not 22%. *At the moment; subject to change.<br />
<br />
They currently are designed such that they are mana positive while doing their damage and going through their tanking rotations, and stay near full mana the whole time. Mana should not be a consideration to their rotation, rather, it will act as a limit on how much off-healing and other utility spells they can cast.<br />
<br />
Does Holy Insight mean Intellect plate is going away?<br />
No. That passive (and appropriate classes should have an equivalent) gives casters larger mana pools than non-casters of the same class. Mana no longer increases with Intellect, but we still want to make sure that, for example, a Holy paladin can cast more heals than a Retribution paladin.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid))<br />
<br />
The Druid will select a raid or party member and cast Symbiosis on them. The target cannot be another Druid. The target gains a buff that tells them what spell they have temporarily learned, and that spell temporarily appears in their spellbook, and they can drag it to an action bar. The Druid’s Symbiosis button will become the ability they gained from the target class. The Symbiosis link is cancelled if: the Druid clicks off the Symbiosis buff, or the Druid or the target changes continents or enters or exits an instance, or the Druid or the target changes talent specializations. Symbiosis fails to cast if Symbiosis is already active on that target. Symbiosis cannot be cast in combat. For the non-Druid target, the icon will revert to a placeholder (uncastable) Symbiosis icon when Symbiosis ends, but will become the Symbiosis-granted ability again the next time Symbiosis is cast on that target. The ability gained from Symbiosis is always something chosen to match the Druid’s specialization and the target’s combat role. The target always gets the same spell unless they change combat roles. A Druid of a given specialization always gets the same spell from each different class. If there is a change of specs, there is a change of spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of spells gained through Symbiosis. The spells shared focus on utility, cooldowns, and survival. (Adding Fireball to a Moonkin’s rotation sounds cool on paper, but wouldn’t actually be fun in the long run.)<br />
<br />
Balance: Chains of Ice, Mirror Image, Mass Dispel<br />
Feral: Feign Death (Play Dead!), Frost Nova, Soul Swap<br />
Guardian: Ice Trap, Fear Ward, Consecration<br />
Restoration: Ice Block, Hand of Sacrifice, Leap of Faith<br />
Hunter: Dash<br />
Warlock: Rejuvenation<br />
Holy Paladin: Rebirth<br />
Arms/Fury Warrior: Enrage<br />
Enhancement/Elemental Shaman: Solar Beam<br />
<br />
There are a lot more coming, but we'll keep some surprises for now, and many are still subject to change after testing. Including all of those just listed.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock))<br />
<br />
Ember Tap will be received at a later level and will cost Embers. Conflagrate has a 2.0 spell power coefficient (still working on this; subject to change). Malady is a level 3 spell that is replaced by Immolate (Destruction) or Corruption (Demonology/Affliction). Dark Soul is a replacement for Demon Soul based on spec. We’re experimenting with the exact mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wild Imps has not been cut. The code for it simply wasn't ready in time for this talent calculator update. Here, I'll show it to you!<br />

Simple New Talent Trees<br />
Talking with a lot of fellow Pver's and there has been a lot of talk that Blizzard is going to reduce the amount of PvE in the next expansion...<br />
We've never quantified the amount of content coming in Mists of Pandaria, much less stated we plan to produce less content in the next expansion than we have in previous expansions. We've mentioned adding a few PvE gameplay elements in Mists.<br />
<br />
Wow, gear with no stats to make players equal...<br />
No, the point of gear with no stats is not to make players equal. IN ADDITION to the PvE gear progression you typically see in dungeon and raid tiers, in Mists we're adding PvE Challenges to award cosmetic-only sets. These sets aren't meant to replace items/sets from dungeons and raids that increase your character's power. They're meant to be hard to get, entirely optional, and another way for characters to distinguish themselves from others through their accomplishments.<br />
<br />
a talent tree that my kids could pick out<br />
I'm sure your kid could press buttons and make a talent build under the current system too. That doesn't mean it's going to be optimal, or even viable. This type of feedback isn't very interesting or useful.<br />
<br />
Can't we all agree that it's the strive to be the best and or to be better that is what really keeps us playing this game? If it comes to be and at the end of the day I'm not any better then the 8 year old that started playing yesterday, I will stop playing this game along with many other people...<br />
My primary goal when logging into World of Warcraft isn't to be the best. If by better, you mean acquiring more powerful items or higher character levels, I guess that's part of the drive. That's not being stripped from PvE in Mists of Pandaria, contrary to the talks in which you've been involved.<br />
<br />
On that note there has also been talk of a World of Warcraft 2, hmm now this sounds like a good idea with a great focus on PvE wouldn't this help solve everyone's PvP / PvE problems?<br />
I'm not sure I understand how the solution to the fabricated problem of a lack of PvE content -- in an expansion you haven't played yet -- is to make a completely new game. We're focused on developing additional expansion content for World of Warcraft, not designing a sequel to the first title.<br />
<br />
There has been so much lore that has been skipped the possibilities for this could be endless<br />
We don't really see it as much of a problem that we have a lot of story at our disposal to use in developing new content. But we also don't need to reinvent the game to explore that lore.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, Zarhym, isn't the entire point of the MoP talent system that, for most practical purposes, optimal or viable specs will no longer exist? Shouldn't this hypothetical &quot;kid&quot; be ideally able to randomly press buttons and come up with a viable talent load-out which only differs from others in subjective &quot;fun value&quot;?<br />
Sort of. I wasn't really interested in entertaining the OP's argument though, because the kid* who blindly chooses a potentially viable build isn't going to blindly know how to play the class well.<br />
<br />
*Referring to the usage of the word in the OP's post, which I presume is defined as someone who should be too young to figure out how a WoW class is successfully played. <br />
<br />
So the idea behind players being rewarded based on the efforts is basically being tossed to the side now? It at least appears that way with features like LFR which allows players to go afk and intentionally leach off of other players and collect rewards that improve their &quot;power&quot;, while the new challenge modes which require effort from each individual player working together as a team just rewards cosmetic rewards.<br />
You make this claim as though the Raid Finder is synonymous with Heroic raids, in terms of providing the highest quality gear in the game. That's not the case. Even with Raid Finder and PvE Challenges in Mists of Pandaria, the best sets in the game (stat-wise) will still be rather difficult to obtain.<br />
<br />
Just one of the factors that has players dismayed at the direction the developers are taking the game.<br />
You'd have a really hard time arguing your last sentence on behalf of the entire playerbase. I could argue there are players who are dismayed right now that Peddlefeet's butt isn't as firm as it should be. Is that a larger argument about &quot;the direction the developers are taking the game&quot;?<br />
<br />
If you weren't interested in his argument, maybe responding to it was a bad idea? Just sayin.<br />
I took eight of his words and said they didn't make for an interesting argument. No, I don't think it was a bad idea to address the other points of the OP just because I didn't find his &quot;my kid could do it&quot; argument interesting.<br />
<br />
And you're not saying, you're asking (though surely I'm to assume it's rhetorical). And why does everyone need to follow up saying something with &quot;just sayin&quot; these days? I know you're just sayin'. You just said it!<br />
<br />
^ I just typed and posted those words right up there. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217637-loss-of-pve-wow-2/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4063168758?page=3#51))<br />
<br />
Buffs... Where are they?<br />
At this point in the development cycle, there hasn't yet been a finish put on buffs. As we've said elsewhere, we wanted to get the talent calculator updated sooner, rather than wait around for more details on related subjects to be fully developed.<br />
<br />
We're considering publishing a developer's blog on the subject of buffs as quickly as we can. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217628-buffs-where-are-they/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4063008444?page=1#7))<br />

<br />
The rules of engagement this year are as follows:<br />
<br />
No restriction on the subject of your post, but keep in mind that questions that may be answered by the release of Mists of Pandaria will likely be overlooked; we don't want to spoil surprises!<br />
Please only ask one question in each post. If your post has more than one question (or if your question contains multiple parts), it will be overlooked. Also, it is recommended that you check the thread to see if your question has already been asked; duplicate questions will not have a greater chance of being answered.<br />
Questions will only be accepted for the first seven days, and the thread will be locked at 11:59 p.m. PDT on February 22. <br />
While the thread is open for questions, forum members are encouraged to go through the thread and &quot;Like&quot; or &quot;Dislike&quot; posts; voting on a post will increase or decrease (respectively) the probability of that question being answered. <br />

Taking away perma-tree, nerfing LB's bloom, nerfing WG and increasing the CD (if glyphed) - it's been a giant expansion of NERFBATTING trees...We got nothing new to play with in Cata, unless you count casting mushrooms for some so-so AoE when you're bored...and all they've been mentioning is Symbiosis - which to me doesn't seem like it's going to have all that much use for PvE - at least in my mind. It also seems a bit muddy and confusing. IDK. I love my Druid and I don't want to have to pick a new main toon for MoP but if we don't have something new and interesting to add to our mix I might just do that. Healing is my favorite role to play, especially in PvE, but I have to admit that Resto Druids are getting boring. All the other healers got something new to toy around with, especially if you're a priest, but it was just half-heartedly assumed that &quot;Druids already had enough buttons to push...&quot; Maybe it's just me but I feel we could use a little bit of love.</div></div><hr />

Uh, what? Giving Balance Druids Mirror Image and Resto Druids Leap of Faith sounds like a great idea for both PvP and PvE! Kind of sad they are helping to balance Druids in PvP via sharing talents, but not being able to play Resto competitively in high-end RBGs has made me a sad Worgen. So I'll take any help I can get, as lame as it may be. Plus, Wild Charge looks sweet. :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, because we all knew the old talent system was full of exciting opportunities for flavor and uniqueness. It's all too easy to underestimate the sheer thrill of googling &quot;elitistjerks&quot; and using the talents they tell you to!<br />
<br />
/sarcasm<br />
<br />
As for the easy/hard flip flop scenarios, the devs aren't saying that... it's the players saying that. Some people complained that the beginning Cataclysm heroics were, for reasons I don't quite understand, &quot;too hard.&quot; Other people now complain that the dungeons are &quot;too easy.&quot; So they run the risk when making new, hard dungeons of alienating the people that complained they were too hard, or risk alienating those that say they're too easy by making them too easy. From a financial standpoint, which one comprises a larger portion of the playerbase? Should Blizzard attempt to shaft a group of their players for the sake of some &quot;moral righteousness?&quot;</div></div><hr />

No we will all go to &quot;elitistjerks&quot; to see what ones we have to change for each fight. Not that it will matter because when a lot of these spells and abilities hit the battlegrounds and arenas, and the QQing hits the forums, Blizz will nerf them so bad the will be next to useless. They have it done before and they will do it again.</div></div><hr />

So it'll be even more difficult, because we'll have to type in the extra letters required for the individual boss names, instead of just typing in the spec and role once at the beginning of each patch like we do now. <br />

Because you're asking a question about quest and zone design, which CDev doesn't have any sort of direct control over.<br />
<br />
This has also already been explained officially. It was even in the behind the scenes DVD when the expansion first came out.<br />
<br />
Quel'thalas and the -myst Isles don't have flying enabled because they're part of the Outland map and world server.<br />
<br />
Blizzard did some preliminary work moving them onto the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor map and servers, but with the amount of work needed to pull this off (including moving large amounts of terrain, doodads, and NPCs, and remodeling Silvermoon City and Zul'Aman to accommodate flight) it was determined that they wouldn't have been able to finish it in time for Cataclysm's launch, so they decided to focus only on revamping the zones from classic WoW.<br />
<br />
Quel'thalas and the draenei starting zones did get some minor updates, with new intro narration, additional flight paths, and some alterations to early quests.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if you want to view a more modern look at the Isle of Quel'danas, you can get yourself a Broken Hilt and do the Quel'delar quest chain, which includes visiting a phased &quot;modern&quot; version of Quel'danas and the Sunwell, as it's being rebuilt and repaired by the blood elves.</div></div><hr />

So they want to make it harder for us to choose which talents to use? I thought it was the opposite. Not to mention, most of the talents look like they are pointed towards one aspect of the game (pvp/pve), so I don't think it will be much harder, if at all. People said the same in cata. The new talent system is going to cut out the 'cookie cutter' and make everyone choose what they want, when they want!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2012-02-17, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the idea behind players being rewarded based on the efforts is basically being tossed to the side now? It at least appears that way with features like LFR which allows players to go afk and intentionally leach off of other players and collect rewards that improve their &quot;power&quot;, while the new challenge modes which require effort from each individual player working together as a team just rewards cosmetic rewards.<br />
You make this claim as though the Raid Finder is synonymous with Heroic raids, in terms of providing the highest quality gear in the game. That's not the case. Even with Raid Finder and PvE Challenges in Mists of Pandaria, the best sets in the game (stat-wise) will still be rather difficult to obtain.<br />
<br />
He knows exactly what he meant. Keep pulling that lame hardmode card. If you think hardmodes and 25 man raids with their very low rewards, compared to the very easy normal mode and extremely easy LFR and the 10 man raids which costs far less time to organize, are enough for people who want to spend more time in the game you are pretty ignorant.<br />
People are not going to try hard for some cosmetic stuff for ever. When you are better and put in more effort/time you should be more powerfull. In WoW this is barely the case.<br />
<br />
It's funny, they lose so many subs and then when someone complains (which in the end can make a good point) they brush it off like this.<br />

It's not going to be harder. Maybe when you have to choose between situational usefull talents on bossfights to min/max and gain 100 dps when you are doing 50k dps is a hard decision. But the impact they have is so small that no one will notice.<br />
<br />
And like you say some tiers are plain pve/pvp choices just like some of the last tiers are just a choice between a tanking talent, AoE damage or singletarget damage talent. Real hard choice...<br />
<br />
They made these talents because it is easier for them to balance and it's even more noob/bad friendly. People will still laugh their ass off when they see some idiot dpsing with shockwave or an AoE taunt.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree. I'm not terribly against the new talents, or changes overall. I also wasn't in love with the old Classic WoW's talents either. But I don't want these changes to take place under a false banner like &quot;making tough situational choices.&quot; Thats silly. An overhaul is great if they would just call it that.<br />
<br />
All those who are crapping their pants over &quot;tough choices inbound&quot; need to get over themselves.<br />

No, I was using a sarcastic flare to poke fun at people that would prefer the current talent system purely because they think it's &quot;harder&quot; to choose talents &quot;right,&quot; and is therefore better.<br />
<br />
As for the talents themselves, Blizzard is hoping that people will select talents that sound fun to them to use, as they wont be easily relegated to &quot;if you want to max your DPS, take X situational talent.&quot; So they're edging towards making them a non-issue, versus their current state, in which they themselves are incredibly important, but are basically made a non-issue through the use of the internet. As it stands now, the system is basically like paying a tribute of 30g for a talent reset of 85, and then clicking 41 buttons ceremonially in a sequence given to you by a website to get that part of your character squared away until GC decides your class needs a nerf.</div></div><hr />

There giving you more situational choices, take druid tier 1 for an example feline swiftness would be awesome for a ragnaros type fight but wild charge might be better for V&amp;T (flame breath, second boss in BoT) all 3 choices in that tier could be great for pvp.<br />
I only really know druids so that's why i use that as an example, the whole tree has some tough choices for both pve and pvp except level 90 cause one is pointless and one talent is obvious pve but both of the good talents could be good in pvp.<br />
<br />
Not all tiers are gonna have clear choices on what you should take but some tiers will have obvious choices, sure someone will figure out whats &quot;best&quot; on a per fight situation based on there strategy but choosing a talent that you like better probably wont limit you in MoP as much as doing that would right now<br />
<br />
Right now you don't really have choices cause if you don't take that dps/hps increase talent your a baddie.<br />
In MoP your choosing utility so your choice is based more on play style or what the fight and your group needs instead of 15% mana reduction (as an example)<br />
<br />
Even if someone figures out what every class should use on every single fight im not sure how feline swiftness (15% increased speed) would be that much different then wild charge (charge to a ally's location) except a playstyle choice.</div></div><hr />

Not all tiers are gonna have clear choices on what you should take but some tiers will have obvious choices, sure someone will figure out whats &quot;best&quot; on a per fight situation based on there strategy but choosing a talent that you like better probably wont limit you in MoP as much as doing that would right now<br />
<br />
Right now you don't really have choices cause if you don't take that dps/hps increase talent your a baddie.<br />
In MoP your choosing utility so your choice is based more on play style or what the fight and your group needs instead of 15% mana reduction (as an example)<br />
<br />
Even if someone figures out what every class should use on every single fight im not sure how feline swiftness (15% increased speed) would be that much different then wild charge (charge to a ally's location) except a playstyle choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is EXACTLY what people said about the cata changes. Almost to the T. Many posts and people I spoke to were convinced the cata changes would fix the cookie cutter specs, and make it to where you can make fun choices and not lose dps by choosing what you want.<br />
<br />
So these changes make it to where instead of looking at a website for my spec 90% of the time, I'll have to look at a website for ever boss or situation I'm in? That sounds like the same thing to me. I'm not dogging the changes. A lot of them seem neat. I like the idea of, for instance of Rogues needing to choose between Prep and Shadowstep. I just don't like how some people hail the changes with the banner of making things more making interesting choices and utility. I think rogues who prefer ShS will choose it and Rogues who like Prep will stick with it.<br />
<br />
Looking over at the Druid tier, how many of the tier actually have you making a hard choice for healing in raid? Or Tanking in one? I feel like for the most part there will be clear cut choices depending on your role in the raid or pvp group comp.</div></div><hr />

And talents... Well, some of them are neat. I really like hunter changes. But again - how is Blizzard even considering that there wont be 1 build for PvE, 1 build for PvP? Each of offensive abilities can be easily measured, checking which provides best dps gives you a perfect tree. Some talents are simply bound to spec. And those &quot;utility talents&quot;... come on. To begin with, they dont matter at all. Great choice. Secondly, in current trees you nearly always have some spare points that cant be spent in PvE - efficient way, and need to be put somewhere else.

<br />
To sum up, im quite dissappointed by Blizzards approach. Im not a &quot;hardcore raider&quot;. I just enjoy being rewarded, feeling that I've achieved something in game. And so is any other player. It may sound like I'm a bad person, but seeing the same model of armor on somebody, who does not know how to play his class, or simply afks on encounters puts me down.

Commenting purely on challenge modes, what, then, should they reward? They can't reward real gear, as that's pointless towards progressing further in challenge modes. It'd be like high-end arenas rewarding top-tier HM raiding gear, or vice versa, and then disallowing you from using them in the other, just because &quot;you tried real hard at something and did real well.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the talents, the only thing that would eliminate cookie cutter builds, allow everyone to play how they want, AND be comprised solely of extremely meaningful talents that change how you as a very person function in every single battle would be to develop a talent tree set up that allows players to choose a certain number of any ability they want (relevant to their class/role) from a massive tree that will immediately fit into a rotation/priority system with any and all other potential talent choices, ALL of which (every single possible combination of talents) are all equally balanced to PvE, PvP, and with all other potential combinations from all the other talent trees of all the other classes of all the other DPS, healing, or tanking specs, depending on which role you yourself have chosen and then crafted a rotation for.<br />

<br />
About challenge rewards: Yes, gear can't be a reward. If it is on the same level or a bit higher than the instance, it will be outdated in next patch. If it's on the same level as patch, challenge modes lose their reason to exist.<br />
<br />
But what about items players are USED to consider reward? Pets or Mounts, totally useless, but still loved by community, may be somewhere higher on reward list. On lower reward tiers? My idea is simple. Mats. Gems, ore, leather, cloth, fishes, all that kind of stuff, in bags, bigger on every tier. Why? If you can complete these modes you are probably in a guild that really appreciates such a gift, and those mats may come useful while raiding. Cauldron and Feast can't be done from air. And players will still be trying challenge mode to reach the chance to win a great looking mount, or unusual pet. This system beats cowboy hats in as I see it.<br />
<br />
And talent trees? Make them bigger. More talents, bigger choice, less internet searching, more thinking. Make important choices, like on current tree, but not between OP ability and 2 lame, but eg. stat conversion. Would I like to empower my mastery, so while increasing a chance to get a Wild Shot, it has also a chance to make Wild Shot have a small dot? Or maybe I'd prefer a talent, where EVERY crit gives you Piercing Shots? Those choices may change the way you play, if they are balanced.</div></div><hr />

For healing in most tiers there are two choices for pve<br />
<br />
Tier 1 Feline swiftness and wild charge<br />
<br />
Tier 2 could be all 3 based on the situation<br />
<br />
Tier 3 Mass entanglement or Typhoon depends on the situation (I guess if you have no other class to kite improved faerie fire could help you do that) <br />
<br />
Tier 4 Soul of the forest or Incarnation <br />
<br />
Tier 5 Vortex or mighty bash (Vortex was changed from pulling enemy's to your location to can be placed at any location within 30 yards) <br />

Tier 6 sucks i wont lie: Disentanglement pvp Heart of the wild pve. The other talent is crap.<br />

<br />
You wont need to go to a site to see what you need cause its all based on your playstyle, the strategy and what your group has/needs for utility.<br />

<br />
I'm not a druid, but I have healed as a Pally. But Ill look at the tree and see what I think.<br />
<br />
Tier 1-Most likely Felines Swiftness. MAYBE Wild Charge.<br />
Tier 2-In PVP, this would be a tough choice, in PVE I would go with Cenarion Ward. I just can't see any instances I would say to myself, MAN THAT WOULD BE GREAT!<br />
Tier 3-From a healing aspect I see none of these as that amazing. Your tanks should have aggro, so knock backs and roots shouldn't be important. FF? I think a tank would benefit more from it.<br />
Tier 4- Incarnation<br />
Tier 5- A Slow, a stun, and a root......<br />
Tier 6- Puke.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless the way raids will work are changing, I just can't see most of the talents being applicable to healing at all. MoP isn't here yet, so who knows. I'm not hating on the talents so much as how people seem to think the choices they make are as tough as they say. For the most part I think on my characters trees, I will be keep the same ones unless they counter a very specific mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll have a set mana pool yes that's the way it was in Vanilla wow. Once your spellpower goes up and spirit you wont notice the difference.<br />
I can only speak for resto druids but we have internal mana regen talents based off of are max mana an right now there op as hell you can pretty much just reforge spirit.<br />
<br />
Healers get a passive talent that increases there mana by 400% so a pally for example wont have 24k mana like ret does.<br />
<br />
Casters normally have there own way of gaining back mana i.e. mages have evocation along with other talents there getting in mop.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-02-17, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, giving excess of power to classes that shouldn't need such extras...<br />
<br />
Then they say the old &quot;if OP class loses control and etc. we will compensate with more damage&quot; and in the end, they will just give both as they usually do and screw game balance.<br />
<br />
They also always say before a new expansion &quot;we're looking to chill out some of the passive, automatically-applied snares on some classes get because there's no real gameplay to them beyond just I touch you and you're snared.&quot; (at least this time they only talk about snares instead of all CCs, like the excess of stuns/fears). Again they won't chill it out and the unbalanced distribution of said CCs between classes/specs screws the pvp in this game. A few specs with way too much and all the rest with so few, on top of that these few classes/specs with so many tools and all of them on their each DR. So much wrong going on at the same time that it sucks...<br />
<br />
And still 8 seconds for cc in pvp... lol... still too much. If we had a better distribution of tools between classes/specs, then ok. But the way it is 8 secs is a lot when one class can go 8+8+8+8..., most of it with short CDs... while the other can just 8 (if they can...) then sit and watch waiting a long time for that CD to come off so they can go &quot;8&quot; again... and considering that things like healers, are balanced around those few classes/specs that can lock a player out of combat for that much time, you can imagine how much it does suck to be on the &quot;8 and wait a lot&quot; side against healers and etc.<br />
<br />
If they really wanted to balance the pvp, they would have removed most of this &quot;proc while you press your high dmg buttons&quot; crap, auto-attacking application and reflective procs of debuffs, so ppl would need to think more about what to do with their resources and GCDs.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the rest is also crap, it's sad that they are &quot;open for discussion&quot;, but most of the time, just mock players, showing that they're not that open for discussion.<br />
<br />
The LFR vs. heroic raids is total BS, in a game that is moving as fast as they can, heroic raiding is useless as it's rewards are totally destroyed by the few months later drops from easy modes (we're talking about the most of the user base that Blizzard catters to, not the few players that do it for the challenge), most players won't want to waste time and effort to down a heroic just to use the little better drop for a few months and then get something better in the next LFR. Is just like the waste of time in doing the raid achievements for the tier's mount instead of just roflstomping it a few months later (or as soon as someone killed the last heroic boss like it was in FL).<br />
<br />
Only the guilds fighting for a realm's 1st actually have use for the current system as it helps them go heroic mode 1 week later with less drops needed from the normal mode. The system would be interesting for way more players if the current heroic gear could be on par (or even a little better) with the normal mode gear from the next tier, it would made sense for every player to try and get heroic gear as they could really use it for the next heroic tier instead of dropping most of it (except for those few OP pieces) for new LFR/normal mode pieces. It would make the effort worth way more. Also if they always change drop rates of mounts (like bosses that have 100% drop chance on heroic) on the next tier, would make ppl more interested in keep going (or even trying) before they would have to farm in a lower drop scenario thanks to the nerfs or new tier making it easy. Even removing the achievement mount like they did with T7 drakes, so there would be a reason to try it instead of waiting just 2, 3 months (or a new tier) to get it. But that's is something that they don't want because they prefer to see players still going to things like ulduar, icc, etc. at 85-90 just for the mount.<br />
<br />
And the challenge modes? Ok... it's nice on paper, but since they need to make those cosmetic rewards interesting, they will obviously appeal to a lot of players... but let's be honest, unless it's not a real challenge, not everyone will be able to get most of those since the challenges are supposed to not be outgeared with their gear normalization rule. So, how long before they catter to the players that will demand they lower the dificult of said challenges because making them put effort for it is &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;work at home&quot;, &quot;epeen&quot;, etc. and they are paying $15 for it, but get &quot;content&quot; denied???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Symbiosis says hi, you need to have the class in your group like mage gives resto ice block which drops threat (Kitty can take feign death from hunters) but its a nice way around not giving every class every talent.<br />
<br />
If every class had everything the game would be even more boring then it already is. honestly a aggro dump is the one talent resto druids don't have atm (that they could use)<br />
<br />
They haven't finished what druids get from other classes with this talent but i can see resto getting dispersion things like that.<br />
<br />
You could also switch to bear if you took the heart of the wild talent cause switching from resto to bear switches 95% of you int to armor its not a aggro dump but may save your life till the tank picks the adds up. (In theory)<br />

<br />
So it'll be even more difficult, because we'll have to type in the extra letters required for the individual boss names, instead of just typing in the spec and role once at the beginning of each patch like we do now. <br />
<br />
Besides, it's much harder to judge the raw DPS output of &quot;situational&quot; abilities, which almost all of these are.<br />
<br />
You do realize most of the talents are utility talents with no or only slight impact on actual DPS/HPS.<br />
<br />
Also, you cannot always expect to do the same things on same boss fights. You might have a change in raid roster causing you to have to do things that you wouldn't normally do (managing adds etc.).<br />
<br />
However, you are right in pointing out that for a certain purpose where you know exactly what to expect and how the fight will go through, and you know what your role in that fight will be, you obviously can and will find the best suited talent combination for that single purpose. However, any change in that pattern might cause some of the other talents become more desirable changing your talent specialization as whole.</div></div><hr />

Talking with a lot of fellow Pver's and there has been a lot of talk that Blizzard is going to reduce the amount of PvE in the next expansion... We've never quantified the amount of content coming in Mists of Pandaria, much less stated we plan to produce less content in the next expansion than we have in previous expansions. We've mentioned adding a few PvE gameplay elements in Mists. That statement has me worried. I know it's not a confirmation that it's true, but it was also the typical non-answer you get when it's a possibility.</div></div><hr />

I can only speak for resto druids but we have internal mana regen talents based off of are max mana an right now there op as hell you can pretty much just reforge spirit.<br />
<br />
Healers get a passive talent that increases there mana by 400% so a pally for example wont have 24k mana like ret does.<br />
<br />
Casters normally have there own way of gaining back mana i.e. mages have evocation along with other talents there getting in mop.<br />
<br />
Direct me to this....I havent saw this fixed mana pool thing yet :S</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid those statements are contradictory. Pretty sure a wise man once said &quot;Learn from your elders&quot;, if you see someone do something spectacular, never be afraid to ask them.<br />
<br />
Also, any guild member(s) that i imagine someone would ask will go straight to EJ and give you the results. You spend most of your adult life, being taught by a person who teaches you thinks that they learned out of books. These books, are books that are generated after months if not years of research conducted by individuals who excel in these fields. Ultimately, the source of knowledge comes from the place where the most research, testing, and conclusion is done.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with consulting the experts immediately and then following their paths, unless you are -curious- about what would happen if you didn't. There is nothing wrong with that either.<br />
<br />
If we didn't follow those guidelines, every time you purchase a car that claims to be the &quot;safest car&quot; it should be driven off cliffs and deliberately smashed to to see how safe it really is. Then you can purchase another car that you have personally tested.</div></div><hr />

If you think all it takes to be top dps over someone else is the exact optimal talent tree to get you that 100 extra DPS ...<br />

<br />
It's likely mounts and stuff will be rewarded for metas and whatnot, or for leaders in challenge modes. And remember, challenge modes equalize all your stats... so rewarding &quot;better&quot; gear would be pointless as it would just be downgrading it to whatever margin blizzard allows in challenge modes. As I understand it, Challenge modes will remain &quot;contemporary&quot; throughout all of MoP, as you can't potentially outgear any of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First i say that you were right. I was contradicting myself a little. Realized after reading your post. And i think you make a valid point. It's ok sometimes to rely on data that is being provided by other players. BUT in my opinion game should be more than that. <br />
<br />
Let's say some young new player makes an account and find him/her-self a nice guild. When asking for help he/she gets directed to website with all possible info like gear, skills and talents and gets frightened by all that difficult jargon and ends up quitting after 2 weeks. ( this may be cause of low number of good tanks)<br />
<br />
This is what i mean by not knowing the meaning of right answer. You can't learn karate by reading a book either. It's only there as reference when you have basics in your head. Same with WoW. Deciding talent choices that are made by others won't deepen understanding of your own class. After doing so you must keep relying on those web pages 'cause you can't play by yourself.<br />
<br />
Well, I know this is just an extreme case and most of the player base already know what's best for them. But as veterans we should cultivate those young sprouts and make sure they dont grow wrong way or die out.</div></div><hr />

&quot;What is being done with spell crit for DPS specs? Our baseline assertion is that all spells and abilities will crit for double damage.

Maybe just the elemental shaman. It sounds promising for enhance, but it won't mean much if Lightning Bolt still hits like a pillow. Although... I wonder how much more Lava Lash will hit for if it isn't already effected by 2x. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the perspective of having played the Pen&amp;Paper Earthdawn, I don't see it as that weird. And from the perspective of computer RPGs, it seems that we're getting past the old EQ-based design. Static mana pools make it easy to use differently-themed mana regen mechanics and still have them balance out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If every class had everything the game would be even more boring then it already is. honestly a aggro dump is the one talent resto druids don't have atm (that they could use)<br />
<br />
They haven't finished what druids get from other classes with this talent but i can see resto getting dispersion things like that.<br />
<br />
You could also switch to bear if you took the heart of the wild talent cause switching from resto to bear switches 95% of you int to armor its not a aggro dump but may save your life till the tank picks the adds up. (In theory)<br />

if your looking for dps/healing increase talents, for the most part you wont find them here.<br />
There all utility, i do agree that raids like dragon soul there pointless but Nef and magmaw things like typhoon and a stun would have been nice.<br />
<br />
I would love to have renewal for the slime boss on heroic. in dragon soul<br />
