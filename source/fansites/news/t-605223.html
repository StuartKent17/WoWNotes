Sunwell trash loot update<br />
A new loot has been added to the Sunwell Plateau trash in one of the latest builds, the Ring of Harmonic Beauty (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/harmobeauty.jpg).<br />
<br />
<br />

Paid Transfer and Name Change Cooldown<br />
The cooldown to transfer your character or change your name is now 1 month only.<br />
We have made changes to the Paid Character Transfer and Paid Name Change cooldown times, and have lowered them from three months, to one month. The cooldown refers to the length of time between when a character first uses one of these services and the next time it can be used. These two services do not share a cooldown.<br />
<br />
When the paid transfers originally opened back in June of 2006, they included a six month cooldown. This was rather high as we had no statistics or data that would show us what effect the transfers would have on the game as a whole. It was rather conservative for a new feature. After analyzing any possible security risks, impact on the economy, and effect on in-game communities, the cooldown was reduced to three months in October of 2006.<br />
<br />
Since that time we have released eight major content patches and the Burning Crusade expansion, and as the game has evolved we have continued monitoring the impact these services have, who’s using them, and purpose for their use. We’re now confident that a cooldown reduction to one month will not increase an already minor impact these services have.<br />
<br />

Warlocks - Lifetap changes in 2.4<br />
The new version of Lifetap was bugged badly when it's been introduced on PTRs, blizzard employees made a few posts to explain how the skill is supposed to work in 2.4.<br />
Yes there is a bug with lifetap only returning mana based on your current mana instead of your maximum mana. This is being worked on. ([b]Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4821924309&amp;postId=47753359571&amp;sid=1#3))<br />
<br />
Improved Life Tap will work the same as it always has. You get 20% more mana with the talent than you get without it. So, with 0 points in the talent, you get 15% of your max mana. With one point, you get 16.5%. With 2 points, you get 18%.<br />
<br />
The amount of health lost when tapping does not change. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4913821490&amp;postId=49134094193&amp;sid=1#7))</div></div><hr />

Power Infusion looks a little less depressing (11&gt;31?) now, that actually isn't bad. Would have some interesting PvE applications too. I'm increasingly curious how they plan to complement this and the other Disc primary talents in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

reduce by -20%? So that's an increase? Or just a typo?<br />

<br />
It's to balance out that S4 resto don't have travelform speed bonus, to avoid shamans kiting players with frost shock / earthbind totem.<br />
<br />
But indeed, it's lame. Couldn't they just start to disable bonuses like that in arena *only* , it's lame that something that is so beneficial for leveling is disabled outside.<br />
<br />
<br />
your comparing s4 resto to lvl 60 gear :D<br />
<br />
and as for kiting with frost shock / earthbind totem:<br />
ghost wolf doesn't remove movement impairing effects (at least not yet), so when i reflect that frost shock or toss on hamstring/piercing howl, that shaman isn't going to kite much. <br />
likewise shamans don't have HoTs to keep someone up while they kite, so overall they won't be on the same level as druids by any means. <br />
<br />
and i don't see why they removed it either, it was nice for leveling. perhaps people can use this as an example of class changes being made in response to pvp :D</div></div><hr />

I would imagine that anyone that pauses at level 60 to farm honor gear isn't in such a big hurry to level up anyway. You would save more time skipping 30 minutes of BGs than you ever would by having that minor ghost wolf speed boost in all the time from lvl 60 to 70.</div></div><hr />

Nerf the spell damage coefficient to 60% (80% now) or perhaps even lower.<br />

But nowadays, between fel armor and the spell scaling so you dont have to lifetap 142 times to get your damned mana back, I don't pity them at all. The change is fine and very fair, and even if Warlocks do not feel so, trying to petition classes that drink 25-30 Supers per raid and still only barely hang on isn't going to work. <br />
