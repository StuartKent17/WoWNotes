It's All About Pepe: New In-Game Outfits and Plush<br />
You can finally find Pepe!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-pepeloc&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/thumb/pepem01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/pepem01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/thumb/pepem02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/pepem02.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/thumb/pepem03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/pepem03.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/thumb/pepem04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/pepem04.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
There’s something about Pepe that has everyone all aflutter, and today we have a bunch more reasons for you to love him.<br />
<br />
First, we’ve added a Pepe plush to the Blizzard Gear Store*! He’s soft, squishy, loveable, and can clip onto a hat or hairband (or pretty much anywhere else) to go with you anywhere Pepe wants to go.<br />
<br />
Get your own Pepe now! (http://blizz.ly/1GEOw84)<br />
<br />

<br />
But wait—there's more!<br />
<br />
Pepe's Brand New Clothes<br />
Several new in-game outfits for Pepe are also now available for you to track down. Collecting them all will reward the I Found Pepe! (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10053-i-found-pepe) achievement. We’ve written some clues—and more than a couple of bad rhymes—to get you started on the right path to locating each one. (We’re not even a little sorry for it. Screenshots below not indicative of his in-game location. Good luck!)<br />
<br />
Knight Pepe – Talador<br />
Sir Pepe is a knight, you see, but every warrior needs a rest. You’ll find him half-asleep right now near a pile of amythest.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ninja Pepe – Gorgrond<br />
What killed these iron hordies, you thought you knew—but alas, you were wrong. Turns out it was the stealthy Ninja Pepe all along.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Pirate Pepe – Spires of Arak<br />
Pirate Pepe flew down south to visit his feathered friends. You’ll find him there relaxing in some arrakoa ru-ins.<br />
<br />

<br />
Viking Pepe – Nagrand<br />
This Pepe will be easy for anyone to spot. Viking Pepe always thought his dancing moves were hot.<br />

You cant be serious. 20 dollars is nothing, for good quality plushes like Blizzard has. The Froswolf pup is what 25? Ya Im sure you can go buy shit quality bird plush from ebay but ya....</div></div><hr />

Same deal but a much bigger market. Wildly overpriced items that complete suckers will buy. With Pokémon they can charge more for the same reason.</div></div><hr />

Others would pay a lot more. It depends what its worth for you. I personally wont buy it. But again 20 bucks is nothing crazy</div></div><hr />

It started out as a little easter egg one of their 3D artists put into the game.<br />
<br />
http://jordtron5000.tumblr.com/post/103210830261/i-originally-created-pepe-to-help-breathe-some<br />
<br />
If you find and click on the bird, he perches on your head and sits there for an hour (or until your die), looking around and occasionally tweeting. Players discovered him, thought he was cute, and he became popular, so Blizzard put some achievements into the game for defeating a ton of different raid bosses with the Pepe buff on, and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, okay. Everyone has their own price for these things. But if you compare the price of plushies from other companies, $20 isn't a strange price at all.<br />
<br />
My kid collects plushies, so she's getting one. It's not a cheap plushie, but it's also not the most expensive one she's gotten either.<br />
<br />
Like others have said, $20 for a thing you can actually hold vs $25 for a pixel mount. Don't really see it's unreasonable. Fair enough if you don't want to drop $20 on a stuffed toy, no problem. But it's a fair market price.</div></div><hr />

Probably just going to have some stuff worked into the opening ceremony.<br />
<br />
Legendary is handling all the publicity for the movie so I don't really know how much you can expect out of them for Blizzcon. There's also still like half a year before the movie's release, so I wouldn't expect a full promotion push until like next April or May. That's when you'll start seeing TV spots, game tie-ins, interviews, etc.</div></div><hr />

$20 for a plushie isn't even remotely approaching expensive</div></div><hr />

People don't like it, people don't even know it exists. I've never once seen anyone ever mention it in game. The only time I've seen it is on here. It's probably some bnet forum weirdo meme that 5 people circle jerk constantly.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't promised for Blizzcon at all. On the twitter of Duncan Jones it just says November. More than likely Blizzcon but still can be in any time of November.<br />

Keep them out of direct sunlight and they won't fade much or at all. Vacuum them regularly (alongside your normal cleaning sessions) and they should stay good, I have a large collection of plushies, and haven't had any problems keeping them clean or had them fade. I have had kids with sticky fingers though, a couple have succumb to that, and I just sponge clean them, don't soak them, just dampen a cloth or sponge and clean marks/sticky messes and hang em up at the window or outside on the washing line to dry. then give them a little brush to bring the plush back to plushiness ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah ok. Thank you so much &lt;3.<br />
Wait though. Wouldn't the vacuum kind of ruin the plushiness? Like maybe suck in the feathers or the plush... Even with a nozzle? I have this attachment for the vacuum that looks like a brush... Would that be an appropriate tool then one of those crevice tools that are long and have a small opening at the ending?</div></div><hr />

Does... Blizzcon not have a musical guest this year? What the hell is the 200 price tag for?<br />
<br />
To pay Wil Wheaton to act like a SJW douche bag at Blizzcon, and maybe exploit some female Blizzard fan for his sleazy agendas.<br />
<br />
<br />
They're trying way too hard to make this pepe shit a thing. It's sad. <br />
<br />
In their sleazy moba Heroes of the Shitstorm, they tried to make a fake meme about Sonya being called &quot;Barbie&quot; despite no one who plays D3 ever calls their Barbs &quot;Barbie.&quot; Not once did I see anyone say &quot;Barbie&quot; in D3 games; not even Diablo fanboys used the word &quot;Barbie&quot; for their characters. It's just as sad as this Pepe shit.<br />
<br />
Once again, Blizzard is out of touch with everyone who isn't a naive fanboy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So long as its not a super industrial strength vacuum you will be fine:) the little brush nozzle you mentioned is actually what I use! I also sometimes just use the narrow ended crevice tools too, of course if there are delicate parts on the plushie you will want to secure them/hold them down whilst using suction so as not to have them get sucked up or bent and buckled. Just be careful, but you shouldn't have any problems :) Oh and Blizz plushies are good good quality so you shouldn't be afraid of the plush being sucked up by the vacuum. They are quite durable!</div></div><hr />

Yeah Hall E is the downstairs area where they do badges. The missing D3 Demo area is interesting because they specifically mention that they had PC &amp; console demo stations in the blue post about the slaughtered calf inn. http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/19914525/join-us-at-the-slaughtered-calf-inn-10-13-2015<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll just have a few stations set up in the inn, like at one of the vendor booths??<br />

It's been around since wod launched, I've been through three guilds during wod and people have all known about it and hes been pretty popular as a fun, cute little gimmicky thing. Maybe you just play wow with a lot of ignorant people?<br />

<br />
This probably took an artist a day or two to make, maybe it was even like the selfie camera and something they did in their own time cos it would be fun. If you were in charge, what would you have made instead that amuses 99% of the people who play wow and only takes one artist a day or two to make?</div></div><hr />
