This November marks the 10-year anniversary of World of Warcraft, and we’re cooking up a few in-game plans to commemorate the occasion. Here’s a quick preview of what’s in store:<br />
<br />
Tarren Mill vs. Southshore: The Rematch<br />
If you engaged in PvP early on in WoW, you might have fond memories of—and perhaps a few scars from—the endless tug-of-war between Horde and Alliance players at Tarren Mill and Southshore. To recapture that feeling, we’ll be opening a Team Deathmatch–style Battleground based on that timeless struggle. However, unlike the old days of Tarren Mill vs. Southshore, there will be a clearly defined victor, so you’ll need to work as a team or face crushing defeat.<br />
<br />

<br />
Molten Core Gets Boosted<br />
Molten Core provided many WoW players with their first taste of WoW raiding. For the anniversary celebration, max-level players will be able to participate in a special 40-player Raid Finder version to relive the experience of hunting down Ragnaros and his minions within his fiery lair. Downing the Firelord will earn you an Achievement and a special Core Hound mount reward (fireproof leg armor not included).<br />
<br />

<br />
Corgi-licious<br />
Anyone who logs in during the 10-year anniversary event will also be able to claim a feisty, fiery new pet: the Molten Corgi! Just think of the corgi-parade potential when you and your friends summon these wee waddling balls of fire for a walk.<br />

These events and rewards will only be available for a limited time, so make sure to check back with us later for more information on when you can expect to see them in-game. ‘Til then, we’re looking forward to celebrating 10 epic years with you!</div></div><hr />

having Molten Core available and emulating the tarren mill vs southshore battles for the 10 year anniversary is a great call back to the first major Raid and first major pvp experienced by players within wow.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Buy the expansion and rush through the leveling content that we specifically made unrushable because we want people to enjoy it&quot; isn't exactly &quot;Buy the expansion and play it how we want you to.&quot;<br />

They won't.<br />

The anniversary is early November. It's not coming out before then. The PTR hasn't even been annouonced yet, let alone anything 6.0 tested. And the PTR always lasts 2 months.</div></div><hr />

It says MAX LEVEL. If WoD is out then max level is 100. If you don't have WoD then you can't be 100 therefore you cannot queue for it. If WoD isn't out then obviously it will be a level 90 instance. They aren't making two versions. Max level is either 90 or 100, not both.</div></div><hr />

ptr testing wont take 2 months 1 month at best theres nothing that needs to be tested that cant be done in the beta also we'll know for sure at gamescon, considering they have yet to do a pre xpac patch that didnt screw everything up anyway</div></div><hr />

Supposedly: <br />
Start date: 11/17/2014<br />
End date: 12/01/2014<br />
<br />
That's obviously encompassing a time where WoD is out, even if you are one of the people that think its post blizzcon. <br />
Doesn't reveal much that they didn't say a specific level, but if that range of time is true, I will be very happy. <br />
Three full weeks!</div></div><hr />

No. The anniversary is near the end of November. Secondly many are suggesting an October release so if it takes you over a month to level, well you must really take your time</div></div><hr />

<br />
A pretty safe conclusion from this is that the expansion WON'T be launching in November. If it did, people wouldn't be given enough time to reach max level and take part in the MC raid during the event. And it certainly won't launch DURING the event, so November 18th till December 2nd are pretty much 100% ruled out for launch dates.</div></div><hr />

The anniversary is early November. It's not coming out before then. The PTR hasn't even been annouonced yet, let alone anything 6.0 tested. And the PTR always lasts 2 months.<br />

&quot;always&quot; is a blanket statement. Avoid those here. Furthermore, the x.0 ptrs usually take very little time because they have been tested on beta by accident!</div></div><hr />

This news update almost makes me want to comeback - just for the month of the anniversary. <br />
<br />
Are you people really complaining about this? You're getting the best, most fun, experience that Vanilla players had! You get Molten Core (which gives a mount everyone wished existed TEN YEARS AGO!). You get Tarren Mill vs Southshore as an instance - before we never had that option, we'd fly to southshore (BECAUSE FLYING MOUNTS NEVER EXISTED) and get stuck in Southshore for hours and hours!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, Molten Core in a 40 Man LFR!&quot; - You little brats surely are spoiled. We'd do MC on our mains... and then go to the trade channel and look for an alt PUG MC run! We didn't have the luxury of clicking a little button and having a raid magically land in our laps!<br />
<br />
To anyone looking outside in that used to play this game during it's heydays, they can not believe that some people are upset over getting this. What does Blizzard have to do to please some of you? Give you $2500, Max tier gear and a reach around?</div></div><hr />

They state: MAX-LEVEL Players. Not 90.<br />
<br />
I know I'm just seeing things, but let's speculate that it actually wants to hide the fact that we will be level 100 by that time.<br />
<br />
Yeah it's an interesting one.. would they drop MC for &quot;max level characters&quot; just after the expansion launched thus forcing people to rush to 100? Or would they drop it when everyone is 90?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It says MAX LEVEL. If WoD is out then max level is 100. If you don't have WoD then you can't be 100 therefore you cannot queue for it. If WoD isn't out then obviously it will be a level 90 instance. They aren't making two versions. Max level is either 90 or 100, not both.<br />
<br />
Yeah this is interesting. Maybe patch 6.0 will be around that time and this is a way to test new skills and systems while giving us content to tide for the expansion. The crappy part is that this means the expansion will be coming late as hell... possibly December. Giving this limited time content only a few weeks of lifespan.<br />
<br />
On the other hand maybe the expansion will be early October and this will come at a perfect time for end-game content and will give us TONS of stuff to do when dinging 100. Making everyone happy.<br />
<br />
I pray for the latter.</div></div><hr />

I would be pretty sure they won't release the expansion in November with this event going on. They'll leave at least a month before-hand if the expansion comes out before the anniversary (so mid October launch) or they'll wait until after it's finished (December launch).<br />
<br />
No way they would put it out in November and force people to rush level or miss out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's only one time to get the mount! I'm not sure if they're redoing the raid in its entirety, though. I mean.. with most redone stuff, they usually shorten the new version. They've done so with almost every redone raid/dungeon.</div></div><hr />

They won't.<br />
<br />
The anniversary is early November. It's not coming out before then. The PTR hasn't even been annouonced yet, let alone anything 6.0 tested. And the PTR always lasts 2 months.<br />
<br />
Blizzard already said when they announced WoD that the leveling process will be shorter so that people can enjoy the type of content they want. People who enjoy leveling and exploring will have additional questlines in each zones and some max level questlines in each zone.<br />
<br />
Also we don't know for how long the content will be available. Maybe the raid will be open for more than a week or two to give people some time to get to max level. I'm positive that they will use that content to get more sales and subs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayperos</div><div class="date">2014-08-06, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's only one hour!

This news update almost makes me want to comeback - just for the month of the anniversary. <br />
<br />
Are you people really complaining about this? You're getting the best, most fun, experience that Vanilla players had! You get Molten Core (which gives a mount everyone wished existed TEN YEARS AGO!). You get Tarren Mill vs Southshore as an instance - before we never had that option, we'd fly to southshore (BECAUSE FLYING MOUNTS NEVER EXISTED) and get stuck in Southshore for hours and hours!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, Molten Core in a 40 Man LFR!&quot; - You little brats surely are spoiled. We'd do MC on our mains... and then go to the trade channel and look for an alt PUG MC run! We didn't have the luxury of clicking a little button and having a raid magically land in our laps!<br />
<br />
To anyone looking outside in that used to play this game during it's heydays, they can not believe that some people are upset over getting this. What does Blizzard have to do to please some of you? Give you $2500, Max tier gear and a reach around?<br />
<br />
Someone put on some very rose tinted glasses ten years ago.... and never ever once took them off <br />

The other way around actually. Wow had 40 man raiding a long long time ago.<br />

<br />
They're simply referring to when these items were datamined but we had no way to know what Blizzard's intention was for them. Like the sparkle pony, which I still love today - people howled when it was sold on the store and now you can only ride one ironically. <br />
<br />
It's not a leap to understand what they meant. <br />

That would suck if it requires that you have items from that raid though.<br />
<br />
It would allmost suck as much as going to SS on a toon with no pvp gear right. Its odd how stuff sometimes takes a little effort. I allready know i wont be going to the 100vs100 bg because i havent done any pvp this expansion, and i dont want to start now.

If we assume that the expansion comes on October 14th, and the event starts <br />
one week before the 10th celebration, then that's 29 days to get 10 levels. <br />
Approximately one level in three days.<br />
Now let us assume the event lasts only two weeks, that's even more time to <br />
hit max level. <br />
Now for leveling speeds: The intro takes less than an hour and it gives 1/2-3/4 <br />
of a level's worth experience. Even if the leveling slows down amazingly, there's <br />
still plenty of time.</div></div><hr />

Yes.. Blizzard redoing one of their 9 year old raids is copying wildstar.<br />

<br />
If they released WoD prior to the anniversary it doesn't seem fair to the players that don't purchase WoD. The 10th anniversary is a WoW celebration not a WoD celebration. If you don't purchase WoD then you wouldn't be able to participate at &quot;Max-level&quot;. I don't think Blizzard would penalize players and not allow them to participate in the 10th anniversary if they haven't purchase WoD yet.<br />
<br />
Plus, I doubt they would force everyone to rush to level 100. Rush is obviously different to everyone, for me it would be a rush if WoD was released in October.<br />
<br />
Based on this I think WoD will be released in December after the Anniversary. But hey, that's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a leap to understand what they meant. <br />

When I see people running around on that ugly two headed flappy WoD mount I just feel sorry for them.<br />

No need to feel sorry for my orcs, they are quite happy on their awesomely badass Iron Horde mount.</div></div><hr />

Also naxx was a 40 man raid above eastern plaguelands for level 60-70 but don't take my word for it, go check it up. Think before you make comments in future<br />
<br />
Molten Core, Blackwing lair, AQ40 and Vanilla naxx was 40 man raids. Naxx was never 60-70, it was 40 man lvl 60, or 10/25 man lvl 80.</div></div><hr />

That is if you don't read the quests and don't complete all of them. I intend, and always intended to, complete all quests and read them, during my leveling. I don't want to rush the leveling, then come back and do everything the easy way. I've been playing WoW since two monthe after the EU release, for a long time I didn't have the time to raid or collect pets, or do a lot of things, I had to do all of that during MoP, and I did a lot of farming of old raids, old quests, old dungeons, to gett the mounts, the pets, the achievements. Now that WoD is out and I'm clear with the old content, I want to take my time to enjoy every bit of the new expansion without rushing everything. But as a mount lover, I can't let this one pass, so if the expansion is out too shortly before the event, I will have to rush my leveling to get it.<br />
<br />
So I'm sorry, but I hope we'll be on patch 6.0, with an expansion release in december...<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT&gt; I'm not a no-life, I have a job and play from 9pm to 12pm maximum every evening, and I don't do only things for myself, I help my guild, I do old raids, etc. So no, I'm not sure I will be 100 in a month.</div></div><hr />

Was thinking this myself. I saw the info post the other day about due date being revealed on the 9th ... Seens this celebrations in November limited time only and as awesome as it all sounds .... just makes me think that WoD due dates going to be after November and this is another way to get another months sub out of people. Although by then i guess the Pre expansion patch with lead up WoD story/quests will be active... looking forward to re subbing after a unsubbed break from Siege boringness.</div></div><hr />

Corgis are also REAL dogs. Watch one take on a herd of cattle and you'll realize that ;d.<br />
<br />
YOU feeling that they are overrated, doesn't make them overrated. When lots of people love something, it's usually for a reason even if you can't see it. The corgi pet is for fun and has been a popular wish since the corgi toy in the Grench cave.</div></div><hr />

It's actually with reading the quests. A dev has said it's even intended to take 30-45 minutes.<br />
Furthermore, they've stated that they want leveling to be far faster than it was in MoP, so that <br />
people can get into doing other things faster if they want. So I have a feeling you can do it. (I <br />
read all of the quests as well, doesn't take a ton of time.)</div></div><hr />

Unless they retune the raid instance with more abilities, it should be cakewalk. Even LFR is more complext than Molten Core ever was.</div></div><hr />

In theory many things in this game are a cakewalk, until you involve lfr. Now imagine an lfr not ith 20 randoms, but with 40. My god, the delicious, delicious carnage that will ensue.

They won't alienate an entire portion of the fanbase who doesn't buy the expansion within first month of release.<br />

On beta right now, if you do a dungeon they max level your toon for that dungeon with ilvl 600 gear (or down gear you if you're higher than 600), so the tech is there if they wanted to make your toons 100</div></div><hr />

Old raids are amazing and would spice up things a whole lot. They should drop things like pets, mounts, transmog gear, gold, and other nice rewards, not necassarily up-to-date-gear.</div></div><hr />

I actually hope they don't. Queue times would skyrocket if it was permanent, but as <br />
an anniversary thing (sounds like yearly from their tweets,) people would scramble to <br />
get into it in that window- making queue times normal, as well as keeping it less stale.</div></div><hr />

Turn yeah settings down, no need to go full on ultra just go on low and enjoy the raid. If your PC can't handle that take it as a sign to upgrade. As little as a few quid a month saved back to buy a new PC every 5 years or so is all you need. Literally like £10 a month over 5 years... new PC then start saving again £10 a month. It's not much and you will thank yourself for doing it in the end.</div></div><hr />

The TM battles even after the heyday into BC were a blast, MC sounds fun, and it's very cool that the Corgi will be free after many expected it to just be another store bought pet. The only thing with these big fights I wonder about is lag. When more than 80 or so people get in the same area, no matter what system you have wow goes to 3 fps because the engine or servers can't handle it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are forgetting that every raid and dungeon on the PTR has used level and gear scaling by default. And battlegrounds do the same. They even have 100 talents for scaled up 100's (albeit buggy right now in beta).<br />
<br />
So MAX LEVEL will be 100 and if you are still enjoying the scenic tour through Nagrand as a 93 I'm pretty confident you'll just be bumped up to minimum LFR specs (rather than the current system of just blocking you from queuing LFR until you already meet the requirements).</div></div><hr />

If they released WoD prior to the anniversary it doesn't seem fair to the players that don't purchase WoD. The 10th anniversary is a WoW celebration not a WoD celebration. If you don't purchase WoD then you wouldn't be able to participate at &quot;Max-level&quot;. I don't think Blizzard would penalize players and not allow them to participate in the 10th anniversary if they haven't purchase WoD yet.<br />
<br />
Plus, I doubt they would force everyone to rush to level 100. Rush is obviously different to everyone, for me it would be a rush if WoD was released in October.<br />
<br />
Based on this I think WoD will be released in December after the Anniversary. But hey, that's just my opinion.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how you can not be lvl 100 after a full month even if you are slow. Anyway i think you are still able to logg in on a non WoD account and get the achievement actually. I know some people who have done that before on non upgraded accounts.<br />
<br />
I dont see how a month can possibly be rushing it.</div></div><hr />

Missing the point. I don't want to be with randoms at all. LFR is not enjoyable to me, even if I have part of the raid made up of friends. We're a 10man guild, we don't have 40 people so inevitably at least half the raid is going to be made up of dribblers who just slow everything down.</div></div><hr />
