Firelands Changes Impact - Update<br />
I may not have been clear enough when we posted the Firelands Graphs (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2497-Statistics-Firelands-Changes-Impact-Pumpkin-Carving-Contest-Fan-Art) previously, so let me remind you that they are intended to show which changes made Firelands easier, not how many people raid. <br />
<br />
Some people translated that to &quot;1.35% of players saw the end game content!&quot; and forgot that the sample was 2.7M characters, not 10 players, and someone smart pointed out (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/202915/162-of-players-not-2) that this % is probably around 15 or 20% at this point. (Which is pretty impressive for the end boss of the latest raiding tier)<br />

Death Knight Tier 13 Preview<br />
No, as far as I know we don't plan to make it a reveal at BlizzCon, though there's a chance the timing of its release could, by coincidence, be around that time. It's still planned to be revealed in the same manner the rest have been -- via a blog on our front page with the visual retrospective of previous tiers and developer description. We'd love to post it by next week if we can, but I can't promise that with all the BlizzCon preparations taking place. [...]<br />
<br />
I'll give you a bit of the lowdown on why the death knight set hasn't come out yet, even in the 4.3 PTR files third-party sites are looking through. As with all sets, a concept art piece was done for death knight tier 13. When that was translated to the actual in-game look, we felt it wasn't up to par with the concept, and ultimately wasn't nearly at the quality level of the other tier 13 sets. But, that death knight set was completed weeks ago.<br />
<br />
So, there are times where multiple iterations of how a set will look in the game are made, based on the original concept piece. In this case though, we felt there to be such a gap in quality that we went back to the drawing board and came up with an entirely new piece of concept art, scrapping the original concept and in-game art done for death knights.<br />
<br />
Well, I can say the new concept art is done and the set is close to being ready for image captures. I've not seen either, but I've heard very good things. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/202941/dk-tier-13-revealed-at-blizzcon) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3341768861?page=2#24))<br />
<br />
Firelands Raid Completion<br />
As others have pointed out, your 1.35% is just wrong due to the stats MMO is stating, but whatever, we’re not going to reveal any of our internal numbers to show how wrong you are, or discount the numbers posted on MMO for that matter. I will say they’re likely as accurate as they can be. Meaning, they’re wrong, but at no fault of theirs simply due to the data they have available to them. While we do have data we pull and review very regularly, it’s not always a true measure of success or failure without considering the context.<br />
<br />
We try and make content for all of our players. It’s both a blessing and a curse that the WoW player base is as large and diverse as it is. “Hardcore” players for example tend to dramatically underestimate the skill gap between themselves and the vast majority of other players. A lot of games handle this problem through multiple difficulty settings. That is harder to do in a game as content rich as World of Warcraft, but it is something we’re looking at more and more with new features like Raid Finder essentially adding a more accessible setting.<br />
<br />
But even with a system (we believe) as awesome as the Raid Finder, there are no simple solutions.<br />
<br />
Players are motivated to raid (and do any content for that matter) for a lot of different reasons. A sizeable number of players are satisfied with seeing most of the game content once. If they kill the dragon or slay the Lich King, they (appropriately) feel like they have won the game. That view is pretty heretical to the traditional raider, who is used to working for weeks to defeat a boss and then spending the next few weeks or months farming that boss so that their group has a leg up for the next tier of content. Other players can be motivated by gear, and once they accrue their rewards they are done with the content. Others are motivated by the challenge, and if things are too easy, they lose interest. These players also tend to assume that everyone shares their mindset and they will be happy to wipe on a fight over and over and over with hopes of improving. In reality, we know from data that a lot of players might be willing to wipe a few times, and then after that, they’re done raiding and potentially even playing. It might be easy to dismiss those players and argue raiding is not for them, but that’s not really our design goal. Raids represent an enormous commitment of developer resources. In the same way that we would never make 20 new Arenas just for Gladiator-level players, we don’t want to develop a raid that only 2% of our raiders can see. We will make sure that there are challenging encounters for players who enjoy that sort of thing (as many of us professional game developers do), but then our goal will be to, over time, broaden the potential audience by bringing the content difficulty down. We think the shock with Firelands for some players was that the nerfs were so severe instead of gradual. For the 4.3 Dragon Soul raid we plan on gradually nerfing it over time, sort of like we did with Icecrown Citadel, except by nerfing the content instead of buffing the players.<br />
<br />
There is another portion of players that are just not interested in raiding no matter how accessible it is, and that’s fine too, but we do keep track of how player behavior in the past may match player behavior currently or even in the future as we make these choices. Overall our goals are to ultimately get as many people seeing and downing Deathwing as saw the end of Naxxramas in Wrath of the Lich King. That’s not all going to be day 1 of the patch, or even in the first month, but with the Raid Finder and gradual lowering of content we think we can create that initial super high barrier to test the true worth of the hardest of the hardcore, while also providing some fun and accessible content to a much wider swath of players.<br />
<br />
Yeah, we need to offer a lot of different kinds of content so that non-raiders still have things to do, or even for raiders to do on off nights. The Molten Front dailies were really popular for several weeks, but like all content, players eventually move on. We hope the DMF and even Transmog will provide some non-raid focused activities in 4.3, but beyond that we have plans to do a lot more. And when you see them you'll be all like :O and we'll be all like :D and then people on the forums will still be all like（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻<br />
<br />
The point of not divulging statistics is that they are only one part of what drives overall goals and development. Unfortunately, the fundamental truth is that people put too much behind numbers (case in point, posts in this thread and a couple other dozen that sprung up because of the MMO post), and will build entire cases on them alone with no thought for context or meaning.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that no matter what numbers we show you, it's not going to make any situations 'better'. From time to time we show StarCraft II players literal win/loss %, as accurate as they can possibly be pulled from the source itself, and they're either ignored (because players simply don't want to believe their experiences are &quot;wrong&quot;) or laughed at as being some underhanded plot to feed them misinformation.<br />
<br />
Numbers don't win us anything. They don't win you anything. Conversations are worth having - ones based on experiences and feelings. We know what the numbers say, but they don't mean anything if you are still unhappy with your enjoyment of the game and your perception of its direction.You're spot on, and while we were coming to some of those same realizations not too long ago, unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your outlook) it's not something we realized in time for Dragon Soul. But we do plan to act on those realizations before too long.

I thought blizzard pretty much made all their decisions based on the numbers &quot;not enough people are beating this content so we're just gonna nerf&quot; vs actually figuring out and fixing what the problem is... you see it in all the patch notes. thats just a wall of blue text full of crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I gathered from it was they made a piece of concept art and while it looked great for one reason or another it was just a pain to translate it into working models in game and make it look up to standard so they scrapped it and rebuilt it from the concept art on up.</div></div><hr />

I believe they will be stripped of memory, CPU, HD, etc. You're just getting the board and any built-in components they can't rip out. Heck, more than likely their storage is a SAN and nothing locally-attached.<br />

That someone smart pointed out that there are 3.22 85s per player.<br />
The 16.2% of players was for normal 7/7 (from 5% of characters)<br />
Heroic Rag therefore becomes 4.3% of players (from 1.35% of characters)<br />

The point of not divulging statistics is that they are only one part of what drives overall goals and development.

7219 / 2.700.000 = 0,0027 =&gt; 0,27%<br />
<br />
Doesnt mattter if it is of 2.700.000 players or of 10.000.000 players. Percent will always be percent -&gt; its a statistic!<br />
Example:<br />
10.000.000 / 2.700.000 = 3,77219 * 3,7 = 26710<br />
26710 / 10.000.000 = 0,0027 =&gt;0,27%<br />
<br />
Lets say every WoW player has 3 Level 85 chars. That would mean we have to calculate with the factor 3.<br />
So 2.700.000 are equal to 900.000 accounts<br />
7219 / 900.000 = 0,008 = 0,8%<br />
<br />
Lets say every WoW player has 5 Level 85 chars. <br />
That would mean we have to calculate with the factor 5.So 2.700.000 are equal to 540.000 accounts<br />
7219 / 900.000 = 0,0134 = 1,34%<br />
Kills with twinks not included!<br />
<br />
<br />
So every WoW player has 5 Level 85 chars to get 1,35 %.<br />
I cant believe this...I think under 1 % off all players had killed heroic ragnaros. This could be a believable number!</div></div><hr />

Second boss looks kinda fun. Can't comment more on that, as I still need to see it again to understand it.<br />

Overall: I love the feel of this instance, the same way I loved the feel of Firelands, the same way I loved the feel of Throne of the Four Winds.

I'm sorry but Marrowgar was harder than this. Yes there wasn't much to do in Marrowgar either, but c'mon these are pure tank and spanks something Blizzard was trying to get rid of. They went back to the old Vanilla / BC model of all tank and spanks. Again they are pleasing the non raider. Casual is the bad term because there are casual raiders, and hardcore raiders. The non raiders are the ones they are pleasing. The ones who do PVP all day, or the ones who are going to queue in LFR. Not the guilds, not the good players. Sad if you think about it. I've been playing WoW since early beta and have seen this game go through such a radial transformation to the point the game is nothing like it used to be anymore. Whether it be from business practice to actual content. In some regards I'm glad SWTOR will eat up my money for the next couple years, but at the end of the day I think the MMO market is dying out. Nobody has the creativity anymore like they used to. The standard of &quot;Don't re-invent the wheel&quot; is sticking with developers now a days too I see.<br />

LOL @ Gutmann. Don't get me wrong its a good software for &quot;end-user&quot; type of formats. But for corporate formats we don't use anything like that. Neither does DOD. We fry it. Burn it, microwave it etc. Thats the way you get rid of the data.<br />

No I don't think they are looking for him to be served on a plate I think they want a challenge in the next tier. To be honest if you really look at it most of the bosses in this teir are not a challenge. The majority of fights have you clump up, and have certain gimmicks.

WOW was designed 6 years (or even longer ago) and thus it relies onto this graphics (deep ground) mostly. With implementing new water shader and shadows we made a step into a better direction. Revamping the whole game would just be either impossible or take a buttloads of time.</div></div><hr />

It's normal 10 man. How could you possibly expect anything? First day of Firelands we one shot 6/7, they could just give out free loot right? Normal IS easy. Morkoch looks way more interesting than Yor'saj in my opinion. Yor'saj is the most boring looking fight ever.<br />

A silly stance as many games have very challenging AIs. WoW doesn't have the most sophisticated one, but then again very few PVPers who say it's so &quot;easy&quot; have actually cleared the hardest bosses in the game.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.. Overall they should never have posted this the way they did.. It should have been as part of a larger post, just throwing some graphs up gives the ignorant among us a hammer to say &quot;look at how big a failure Blizzard/WoW is&quot; or &quot;look wow is dieing because blizzard is failing&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard could make some head way to make raiding easer less confusing so players can focus on the content.<br />
<br />
Adding the Raid finder i think is a bad idea... I think they should continue to try and rebuild server communities and make an Casual/Normal/Heroic modes (with appropriate rewards) for all raids and call it done with.. Give the community something to pug, make players deal with each other like they use to back in Vanilla/BC.</div></div><hr />

Normal modes are easy as hell. How much easier do you want it? Even heroic could do with some tune-up on bosses other than Ragnaros. Heroic mode raiding is there to be challenging, not provide feel-good content.</div></div><hr />

On another note, which version of the bosses are we testing? I don't believe it was stated that we were testing normal mode, or the raid finder mode. It is not heroic mode, obviously, because they would announce that, but in this case it could very well be that what we are seeing is the raid finder mode for these particular bosses.</div></div><hr />

They don't release the numbers because they'd look terrible, and they'd be bad for attracting new players. &quot;Hi, come play our game, which is so complicated that only 5% of our players can keep up with the end game content!

Anyway, I can definitely identify with Nyte's reaction. I really dislike being a raid leader, but when your GM steps out and you're the only officer that can track DKP... yeah. For example: The Rhyolith fight this week, where no one wanted to volunteer to do the steering and so I, a healer, had to step up. For anyone who doesn't already know it, don't have a healer do the steering. It doesn't work. @_@</div></div><hr />

Damn, someone beat me to it except I disagree a little. A lot of the responses to the original post try and talk about having to divide both numbers to get to the percentage of players, which is correct. Unfortunately, by some twisted evil form of mathematical corruption, they still get the same 16% figure. In essence, the fraction of players should be equal to the fraction of characters because you have to reduce the number of toons by the number of toons per character. If you do that to both the number of people who have cleared FL as well as to the entire 2.7 mil sample size, you still get 5%. You have to compensate for your sample or else you are saying that while each person has 3.2 toons on average, there are 2.7 million people in the sample (which isn't right).<br />
<br />
Really, the assumptions he made concerning the poll (that of everyone with 5+ only having 5 85s) makes the 5% go even lower for anyone who has cleared it on several alts as well as a &quot;main.&quot; Granted, the poll was taken on a site that only people truly following the game would look at (as others have frequently pointed out), but the fact still remains that there is nowhere near a decent fraction of the paying customers that see the end boss of the current tier die (even after the nerfs). This is especially pertinent since I have a feeling that people who don't take the time to follow the game and contribute to polls would tend to be more casual and raid less. Maybe that's what Blizzard meant when they said the numbers were wrong ;).<br />
<br />
Sadly, I don't think there is enough out-of-endgame content for all of the other people to enjoy without the game becoming incredibly monotonous despite the huge changes in early questing that came out of Cata (I have played for 5 years and have had all the characters available at level cap and find it incredibly hard to find anything worthwhile to do besides farming rep/RP gear/achievements). PvP remains the only thing that is truly fluid, but I imagine that fewer people actively PvP than raid (I'm willing to bet that there are fewer toons above 2200 than have cleared normal FL).</div></div><hr />

No, it isn't the people interested in raiding. It's the people actually raiding in Cata who have had any success. There were many people who were raiding in Wrath. The content changed to something they didn't like, so they stopped raiding. This doesn't mean they should no longer be counted.

All the bosses I've seen in Rift aren't ThAT hard (although Infiltrator was a bit annoying until everyone learned what to do).

The people quitting when the content was hard greatly outnumber those who complain about easy content; indeed, they outnumber the people who are currently raiding at all.

I guess because they do different things than raiding now - its not like everyone plays 1 game forever, right? You cant even be sure that &quot;so many people turned their noses up at raids&quot; since you dont know true dataz. Also, many people i know also quit in late WoTLK due to being burned out after farming facerollable ICC for months (a year actually).<br />
<br />
<br />

I was pretty excited after watching video &quot;previews&quot; for bosses like Flame Leviathan. Despite FL being super-duper easy, he was quite fun. Being able to ratchet up the difficulty by leaving towers up was cool, as well. <br />
<br />
The first boss (Morchok) just looks lazy. And pretty ugly, to boot. I'm not going to whine about reusing models, since you can do a lot with an existing model to make it look unique. However, either this is just a placeholder, or Blizzard didn't bother. The blueish environmental lighting isn't doing it any favors, either.<br />
<br />
The second boss seems a lot more interesting.</div></div><hr />

But don't worry, you can have fun dancing on mailboxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's the same reason why they don't release official server population stats and force players to rely on incomplete third party data. It would not reflect well on Blizzard and their management if it became known.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2011-10-17, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game is going down because most people are just bored... It doesn't matter what Blizzard does from this point on. It's too little and too late. If it's hard then the majority of people won't do it, it's that easy. WoW raids are easy in a way, but when you count in the shitty players, like many of you, even the most easiest task becomes a tedious experience. Blizzard can't do anything about that! <br />
<br />
They're just trying to hang in there. Most my guildies left WoW many months ago and moved on to other titles, mostly non-mmo's because they're tired of them. I can't blame them. WoW really has taken out what used to be &quot;fun&quot; in a mmo. Worst part is that the &quot;competition&quot; think WoW is doing fine so they're doing the same crap Blizzard is doing. In the end it's all just a huge epic fail. <br />
<br />
I got to give one credit to Blizzard tho and that is the dungeon finder, that is by far the most innovative change in a mmo for many, many years. Playing a mmo is all about doing group content, the old ways pushed people away from that because it was such a dread just to find people, and the time it took.<br />
<br />
Personally i've seen way harder bosses in 3-5 man dungeons in EE than i ever saw in WoW raids. Blizzard really has dumbed down the bosses to try give all players a shot at them. Sadly it just doesn't work with the current players WoW attract...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which only goes to show Blizzard is worried. While MMO's numbers were oddly calculated Blizzard knows they have a severe problem. If they went by an account basis, as in how many accounts who have an 85 actually got to the last boss, I would bet those numbers are very low.<br />
<br />
You don't throw a wall of text out there and disparage the poster of information if its not true. You fight back with real numbers and prove your side. Instead Blizzard merely confirmed the problem. The whole &quot;we are not showing our numbers&quot; bit is so laughable.<br />
<br />
Blizzard blew it in CATA by not offering the fans of 5 man a complete armor set to work for. Without that many I knew who used to play stopped and went to other games, notably F2P waiting on GW2 and SW</div></div><hr />

This guy said &quot;this encounter is a little bit overtuned&quot;. Yet they almost finished it with 3 of the 10 players dead. And I thought losing one player in 10 mans was such a big deal, atleast that's what's everyone is saying on these forums.</div></div><hr />

135,859 - represents players, and 2,7mln - toons.<br />
So yeah, its 16%, buuut again, there is shitload of people that dont raid and do other things.<br />

<br />
Double check the graphs from that link. On my screen it shows that the 135,859 represents characters, not players. The 2.7 million number also represents characters (at least on my screen). It would not make sense to suggest that one of those numbers represents players and the other represents toons, when they both use the same word. See my thought process?</div></div><hr />

But you can't possibly be correct, since you get a result he doesn't like.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2011-10-17, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it isn't the people interested in raiding. It's the people actually raiding in Cata who have had any success. There were many people who were raiding in Wrath. The content changed to something they didn't like, so they stopped raiding. This doesn't mean they should no longer be counted. And, even those who weren't raiding in wrath may have been potentially interested, if the content were to their liking (read: even easier than wrath content).<br />
<br />
There is no way to measure that. And those wowprogress numbers are still a good indication of how hard content is (better than those graphs). If you want numbers of how many players are interested in raiding you should look at how many players killed at least one boss and don't forget puggers. And then you can guesstimate how many players &quot;may have been potentially interested&quot; or you could ask every player in WoW.<br />
<br />
&quot;If content is to their liking&quot; is also very vague. Easier content doesn't automatically mean potentially interested people will start raiding. People stop raiding for several reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
The graphs were to show how much influence the nerfs had on the difficulty/progress of players and nothing else. Besides that wowprogress has the best numbers to show how difficult content really is and how many people are raiding. They are not 100% accurate but they are the best out there.</div></div><hr />

Of course there is. Blizzard can see exactly how many people raided in Wrath, and exactly how many are raiding now. Do you think the number has not gone down?<br />
<br />
By wowprogress, the number has gone down greatly from Wrath. The number of guilds raiding has declined, even as most guilds have shifted to 10 man from 25 man.</div></div><hr />

^ and this is y raiding got boring... for casual players who dont raid 3-6 nights a week...<br />
i was a hardcore player back in BC and to tell the truth WoW died when they brang out wrath... the raids were just rediculously easy... hell i took a month break came back ( i was in full udluar gear) and got carried through ICC HC 10m.... now that tells the truth about how easy raids are.<br />
<br />
now go back to sunwell... u couldnt simply just pick up say a random pug and clear it.... u needed the weeks / months of work to down those bosses....<br />
if raiding was as competitive now as it was back in BC, blizz would see alot more of the hardcore scene back in action... not this downing a half of a raid or a full raid in the first night its out...</div></div><hr />

How can you measure people who are interested in raiding? The only way is to ask them if they are. You can't see the exact number of people who are interested in raiding by looking at numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are ways to infer, at least in general, what people want without asking them individually. The people who do this are called marketing professionals. They are paid big money for it. It's not 100% accurate, but it's not something you can just dismiss. Demanding exactness is just your way of being a passive-aggressive roadblock to honest discussion.</div></div><hr />
