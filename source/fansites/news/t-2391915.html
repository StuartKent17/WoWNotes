Upcoming Island Expedition Changes<br />
Changes are coming to Island Expeditions in the next PTR Build. You can check out our coverage of the initial version of Island Expeditions here (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7439-Battle-for-Azeroth-Island-Expeditions-Preview).<br />
Thanks for all of your feedback! I've updated the update post with some major changes coming in the next build. <br />
<br />
4/19 - These changes will be in the next build:<br />
A tutorial quest and island are now available at level 115. Players must complete the tutorial quest to unlock Expeditions. This unlock is account-wide.<br />
Normal mode requires level 110+<br />
Heroic, Mythic, and PvP require level 120<br />
At the start of the Island, 3 high-value targets will appear in the fog on your map as red X's, giving your party some initial direction.<br />
Two new islands are available: Molten Cay and Dread Chain.<br />
Around 800 new creatures have been added (some will lack abilities)<br />
New end of island invasions: Naga, Black Dragons, Twilight Dragons, Saurok, Trolls<br />
End of island invasions now have a pre-spawn visual (so they don't spawn on top of you)<br />
New chest type: puzzle. Find levers, pressure plates, etc. needed to open an ancient chest.<br />
Questgiver required objects (e.g. Torch, Shovel) spawn closer to their questgivers<br />
Visual updates to skyboxes, times of day, and weather effects.<br />
<br />
Of note, we now put three red &quot;X marks the spot&quot; markers on your map at the start of the island. These are always some of the most high value targets on the island, and should give your party some initial direction about where to go. Also it feels very pirate-y. <br />
<br />
The red markers will also show up when an Azerite growth event occurs, at the site of the growth, and when end of island invasions occur, at those sites.<br />
<br />
We've got a bunch more invasions and a ton more creatures in this build as well!<br />
<br />
In addition, you'll now be queueing for a random island, and three islands are unlocked: Un'gol Ruins, Molten Cay, and Dread Chain.<br />
<br />
Feedback Request: The current plan is to have three islands available every week on a rotation. Since we now have three available, we'd like to hear from you about how many times you'd like to engage in this content during the week. Hop in, run a few during the next week, and let us know what you're feeling!<br />

Deaths of Chromie really got me hyped that dragons would get some significant lore development, but some island invaders =! lore development. I guess time will tell though.</div></div><hr />

Aye, no kidding... the early days of Legion with the Warden's puzzle WQ in Vault of the Wardens gives me nightmares with so many morons just randomly clicking on everything...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's funny and telling that you say &quot;early days&quot; because technically that WQ still spawns but NO ONE runs it on purpose any more haha!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Friendly reminder that those are dungeons.<br />
<br />
These are bite-sized 3 man scenarios, so it's easier to fetch some people you know, and you also have in-game voice chat to top it off. So solving puzzles should technically be more easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since blizzard said lorelol with BfA, why should they care about consistency and lore?</div></div><hr />
