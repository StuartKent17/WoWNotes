Tigole: Till We Meet Again<br />
This was announced 2 days ago but I didn't want to mix it up with the Dual-Spec Q&amp;A. Jeffrey Kaplan is no longer part of the World of Warcraft developement team, don't worry he didn't go too far and will work on Blizzard's upcoming unanounced MMO. Tigole was the Lead Game designer of World of Warcraft and played a huge role in its success, it's sad to know that he won't be working actively on WoW anymore, but definitely a good news to hear that the unanounced MMO is in good hands. <br />
I wanted to take a moment to let the community know that I’ve switched roles here at Blizzard to work on our upcoming, unannounced MMO. World of Warcraft has been such a central part of my life these past six and a half years, and it’s success would not have been possible without the tremendous community around it, so I wanted to say thank you to all our players who’ve shared this amazing experience with us so far. Also, while I have served as the spokesperson and Game Director for World of Warcraft on Wrath of the Lich King, by no means would WoW be where it is today without the dedicated team that we have in place. The WoW development team is comprised of some of the most talented and experienced game developers in the world, and it was an absolute honor to serve amongst them, and they will continue to make WoW better than ever. I still plan to be very involved with the future course of World of Warcraft, but will leave the day to day operations of World of Warcraft to my partners in crime, Tom Chilton and J. Allen Brack.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, WoW is still my favorite game. I play it every day. None of that passion is gone. If anything, it fuels the challenge of making our next MMO even better. We know we have some big shoes to fill. So thank you to everyone who has been so supportive over the years, and likewise, thanks to those who have given us pointed feedback on all areas of the game. Without all of the feedback and participation, WoW would not be the game that it has grown to be. Azeroth truly belongs to you and we’re lucky to have shared in your journey. And as always, I’ll still be lurking on the forums and in the game.<br />
Mostly, I just wanted to say thanks. It has been an absolute honor.<br />
<br />

Cutting the leveling time in the future<br />
Our goal is to continue moving forward with World of Warcraft. That doesn't necessarily mean it should be taken for granted that players will have 10 levels to go every time an expansion comes out. On a similar note, if we feel leveling a character from 1 to max level becomes too daunting the further along we get, we're not opposed to addressing that in ways other than simply adjusting the experience curve.<br />
<br />
It's too early on in Wrath's history to begin discussing any details though, as we're still weighing all options. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990656409-these-posts-about-starting--higher-level.html))<br />
<br />
Dual-specialization Goals<br />
The goal was never to allow players to switch specializations on a whim. Having a specific talent set-up should still mean something. Our goal with this system is two-fold:<br />
<br />
1) Allow players to switch to a secondary preferred spec/glyph set-up without having to go through the process of re-specializing, setting up action bars, purchasing new glyphs, etc.<br />
<br />
2) Allow raid groups more flexibility by giving individuals the option of flipping to a secondary skill set to accommodate the group.<br />
<br />
Yes, it will mean there is another reagent players have to bring. We're expecting this feature to be extremely popular though, and I seriously doubt you're going to find yourself with nine to twenty-four other people who have all forgotten to bring Lexicons of Power to the raid. <br />
<br />
Dual-specialization at lower levels<br />
You do make a great point, Cvarto. This is ultimately while the option is still on the table, though the feature is not likely to launch this way.<br />
<br />
I think Ghostcrawler was speaking more about new players leveling. If someone is new to WoW, new to MMOs, or even new to RPGs, talents alone can be a bit overwhelming. Trial and error, and learning the basic damage rotations are very integral aspects of learning the game. Giving players the option of flipping between two specializations when they haven't figured out how the core of the class operates may be a deterrent. <br />
<br />
Like I said though, it's still something we're considering, and I think you've presented a good case for why it's in consideration. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990465436-issue-with-one-of-ghostcrawlers-responses.html))<br />
<br />
Dual-specialization ability cost<br />
We do want to inform our players about what the final cost will be, but that is still under discussion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990765118-1-time-fee-keep-duel-spec-blizz.html))<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration and monotonous healing<br />
Out of casting regen can be a significant source of mana, but this is complicated by the fact that it can also be really random due to clearcast procs and the nature of the fight itself. Something like Loatheb can be easier than intended because the fight asks you to pause a lot.<br />
<br />
Now I remember the long ago healing strat guides and how clever they can make it sound to try and delay a heal to earn more mana. It sounds cool on paper. But the reality was things like stopcasting macros because you couldn't afford to wait a couple of seconds to see if the heal was needed.<br />
<br />
We actually want for healing to be less spammy and more about decisions and coordination. But if we did that sans other changes, everyone would be out of fsr even more and the content would be too easy. Make sense? Making regen more consistent is also the key to making healing more tactical and less monotonous and frenetic.

Bag of Candies<br />
The Bag of Candies had a fairly reasonable drop rate and was in no way bugged; however, due to the random aspect of the achievement, we discussed it and did hotfix an increase in last night. While I'm aware that some of you dislike the chance aspect of this achievement, it will remain in the meta.<br />
<br />
And just to dispel all the superstition around it, no NPC has a greater chance of giving out candies. They're all equal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990944942-bag-of-candies-act-2.html))<br />

Bouquet of Red Roses back in the game!<br />

<br />
P.S. I guess you Tigole lovers play pure classes. I played a Hybrid in early BC. Any well informed hybrid player hates Tigole &amp; Furor with good reason. Wrath has been much kinder than WoW was in the past to Hybrids, it's impressive that they're finally trying to achieve some modicum of balance. It bears remembering the comments that have been made in the past though (like those 2 developers' rants against Hybrids in Everquest).<br />

You may not believe this, but it works the other way around. Buff a class too much, and you start losing players.<br />
<br />
You see, once the joy settles down over being awesome, players start looking for a challenge. No challenge, no fun - and they really over-did the mana regen buff back in TBC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW is to big to be killed by anyone. There are to many people playing with to much time invested into it for it to die.<br />
<br />
People still play DAoC, EQ, UO, CS1.6, ext, despite the companys or original creators making sequels, literal or spiritual.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizz would be stupid to do anything that would hurt the cash flow of WoW. It wouldn't make any sense from a business perspective to end it. <br />
<br />
If anything, their new MMO is going to be less involving and have a different play style and theme so people can play (and pay) for both.</div></div><hr />

Jesus freakin' Christ. Getting tired of this. People on MMO have no idea what the hell is a casual, do they?<br />
<br />
I've yet to see a casual quit, because they are far from done with all of this, and are still having a hell of a lot of fun. But thats just me. I feel like im the only person in this entire forum that plays with true casuals that have daily fun and are not going to be done with the current content for months.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of people thinking they are &quot;casuals&quot; when they are not at all. A true casual is never done with the content, because they are never finished with it before more content gets in the game.<br />

If you are already finished, and claiming its too easy, then you are not a casual... simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You see, once the joy settles down over being awesome, players start looking for a challenge. No challenge, no fun - and they really over-did the mana regen buff back in TBC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Naga please. I doubt you've played a raiding healer for more than a month. It's the most thankless task there is. I can 2 man heal for D3 and all you'll hear is &quot;Good job tanks&quot; &quot;Good job dps&quot;. Like they had it hard, onoes, 5 dps and 3 tanks. Running seriously tight there. ::)<br />
<br />
The only fuck wit (Ghostcrawler) talking about &quot;There should be decisions&quot; plays a class that has so many hots they can sit there idling and still have FOL spamming paladin style hps going on, plenty of time to 'make their decision' between masterbatory strokes. WTB Crab Cakes. Clearly, they haven't a fucking clue what they're doing.<br />

Mrrrrrgl my nrrrrrrrgl. This. And yet Paladin was wholly overlooked on that point, and now downranking killed and DS destroyed. The basicly chopped the class up and fed it to the pigs unless you were lucky enough (like me) to have &gt;25k mp and &gt;40% crit already.

<br />
Tigole is the one who originally wanted every WoW player to be a raider, which has somewhat evolved into casual raids and what not. Kalgan is the mofo who has been pushing a poorly thought-out implementation of arenas as a crucial part of a PvE game (aka e-sport), which some of us are still laughing about.</div></div><hr />

Successful ventures into the space continue to support their player base as long as they are making money and considering games like Everquest and Ultima Online still going strong, with player bases a fraction of what WoW has now (at their peak) World of Warcraft may likely never die. I am however curious to see if their new MMO can branch out and duplicate the success of WoW.<br />

I remember how Lord of the Rings Online was going to come out and kill WoW, and when TBC came out and the massive QQ that resulted over the gear changes and how WoW was ruined and it was going to die, and how Warhammer Online was going to come out and kill WoW, and how Age of Conan was going to come out and kill WoW, and then WotLK comes out and how Blizz ruined the game and made it too easy and how Wow was going to die. Only one thing is for sure... eventually WoW will end. The day that happens there are going to be a bunch of idiots who say, &quot;See! We told you WoW was going to die!&quot; <br />
<br />
I think it's a real bummer that Kaplan is moving on to the new project, but hopefully they'll turn out another great game to play. Personally I'm hoping it's not a Starcraft MMO, but either way I still have D3 to look forward to.</div></div><hr />

Jesus freakin' Christ. Getting tired of this. People on MMO have no idea what the hell is a casual, do they?<br />
<br />
I've yet to see a casual quit, because they are far from done with all of this, and are still having a hell of a lot of fun. But thats just me. I feel like im the only person in this entire forum that plays with true casuals that have daily fun and are not going to be done with the current content for months.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of people thinking they are &quot;casuals&quot; when they are not at all. A true casual is never done with the content, because they are never finished with it before more content gets in the game.<br />
<br />
If you are already finished, and claiming its too easy, then you are not a casual... simple.<br />

Lemme be the second and assure you that there are many many more. I've played for about 4 years and WotLK has had the most entertaining content by far. I'd like to see a few more advanced difficulty instances added, but I know they will be added over time so I'm not losing sleep over it. <br />
<br />
Biggest improvements have been the diversity in style of the quest content and the revival of the epic battleground feel than AV used to have in Wintergrasp. Arena balance may be off the rails, but it just doesnt seem that important since its far easier to get decent gear in PvE at the moment. There are other fast twitch online games to play (completely balanced no less) if you absolutely have to have that fix.<br />

People that feel the way you do, should probably put their accounts on hold and reactivate when Ulduar comes out... what's the point of being disgruntled for awhile because you finished the current content sooner than some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a few members of the pre-WoW MMO player base who despised Tigole for imposing his &quot;EQ cynical uber junkie&quot; philosophy (google it) into WoW, forcing players into somewhat insane timesinks (farming gold, mats and rep) to have access to the high-end content (BWL, AQ &amp; Naxx above all) and as a result preventing the large majority of paying customers to ever see it.<br />
<br />
You may remember those days when application requirements to high-end raiding guilds listed things such as &quot;You must be available 6 nights a week from 7:30pm to 1:00am for raids only&quot;, &quot;At 7:30pm you must be at entry of instance, fully-repaired, potions and elixires loaded&quot; etc. which as a side effect created a huge demand for gold-sellers for those RL-active hoping to raid.<br />
<br />
Tigole wasn't the sole person responsible for it (his boss R. Pardo was his guild master in EQ so they shared that &quot;World-First&quot; bragging philosophy back into 2002-2003 already ;D) but his replies to complaining &quot;casual&quot; customers such as in the Blizzcon 2005 Q&amp;A sessions were sometimes perceived as contempt.<br />
<br />
So some people are sad, some people are happy.<br />
<br />
In any case, he was a key person into WoW raiding and looting mechanics.<br />

<br />
I never stepped a foot into a raid instance in vanilla WoW, yet I enjoyed every second of it. The fact that there were instances I would never see didn't bother me the least bit. If anything it made the world feel massive, like there would always be something to work towards.<br />
<br />
However, it seems that these days there are many players whose egos will be damaged if there's someone who's further along in progression, but who at the same time lack the social, organizational and play skills and commitment that the top guilds have. Thus they complain that the content must be made trivial so that they too can see everything rather than being happy that there's something new to see every time they log in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yet there were people applying to those guilds, no? In TBC you could raid 2-3 nights a week and kill Illidan. There will always be people who play 5-6 hours a day. That's why new, hard content has to be pushed out regularly and time sinks have to be implemented due to content creation speed being less than content consumption speed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tigole wasn't the sole person responsible for it (his boss R. Pardo was his guild master in EQ so they shared that &quot;World-First&quot; bragging philosophy back into 2002-2003 already ;D)<br />
<br />
The &quot;World-First&quot; competition among top guilds is one of the aspects that made the game great even if you didn't take part in it. It was exciting to follow, it pushed Blizzard to come up with new and challenging bosses, and it drove the development of many addons.<br />
<br />
It's quite clear that Blizzard is moving WoW into a &quot;cash cow&quot; stage where they will use minimal resources on it and milk it until the end, while at the same time working on a new MMO. This is obvious from all the lagging due to insufficient server resources, the release of an expansion with practically zero new raid content (TBC had brand new Kara, Gruul, Maggy, SSC, TK, while WotLK had retuned Naxx and a couple new raid bosses), and the fact that key personnel are moved to other projects.</div></div><hr />

2nd I am unhappy he can get his filthy paws on another MMO.<br />

Anyone who knows anything about Tigole and Furor would know what those EMO /wrist kids should not be leading anything!<br />

But a wise man once said: &quot;Good things happen to bad people&quot;. Well that is just something even Murphy's law can't deny.<br />

And I know that as long as a game has anything to do with those people I will avoid it like the plague. I like the way WoW is going now, and it's clear that Tigole's influence has been less and less when we went Towards WoTLK. <br />
<br />
It's people like Tigole and Furor that hold on to Stupid time-sinks, the &quot;only leet&quot; players can see the end content and a bias attitude towards hybrid classes.<br />

<br />
The true value of World of Warcraft, and all Blizzard games, is in the business model. Many companies focus on cutting-edge graphics and rushing a product out the door before its ready. That limits the pool of available customers that can meet your graphics requirements and increases the number of dissatisfied customers. Blizzard intentionally builds games using lower-end graphics with an eye on &quot;perfecting a standard&quot; instead of being &quot;cutting edge&quot;. They labor long and hard and put something out when its ready. They'll cancel games that aren't up to snuff.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't surprise anybody that Guild Wars met with success using the same business model as Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Tigole really had nothing to do with bringing this business model to Blizzard. It was there before him. Tigole designs the game world, quests, and of course the dungeons. So let's look at that.<br />
<br />
The #1 problem with World of Warcraft, and its been the #1 problem since release, is that it relies on a server system where people pick their own servers. This leads to high pop and low pop servers. This is a problem because the talent level becomes extremely imbalanced. Its far, far, easier to construct a guild of skilled players on a high pop server, and they will chew through content at a much faster pace compared to a low pop.<br />
<br />
A player on a low pop server had absolutely no shot at finishing the Naxxramas content in Vanilla nor the Sunwell content in Burning Crusade. In fact, it was very iffy they'd be able to finish Black Temple content before Sunwell was released.<br />
<br />
Now how do you fix this? Obviously the people in charge of the servers could do some things, but that's not Tigole's job. Tigole however designed these dungeons that are completely incompatible with the server design. So really, this is on HIM. Not only did he ever come up with any kind of solution to give low pop server raiders a fair shot, I'm unaware of Tigole ever even recognizing the problem to begin with. Keep in mind, this is merely the biggest problem with the game. <br />
<br />
I can think of solutions off the top of my head. Add some dynamic characteristics to raids. Perhaps on a low pop server, some bosses have reduced HP, or their specials are nerfed a little compared to high pop servers. That would not only give low pop servers some help, but it might actually entice people to transfer off the high pops to the low pops.<br />
<br />
But Tigole doesn't seem to have any answer for this problem. Sure its a challenging problem that calls for creativity, but those are the qualifications of the job that he has. If he can't figure it out, I'm not going to give Tigole high marks.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend him as a designer for future MMOs. Wow's success isn't due to him, and I think he's proven he can't get the job done.</div></div><hr />

I'd wager my left nut if you were put in charge of game design of a new MMO it wouldn't become the most highly subscribed MMO to date. Your &quot;fix low pop servers PVE progress&quot; idea proves that.<br />

If Tigole wants to create a thread on the forums to discuss his future, and then allow a huge number of responses to it, I think he's fair game for criticism. No-one wants a lovefest where you blindly fawn over game designers. Tigole has a lot of responsibility anyway, and this has been a huge problem that he has failed to address.

I give credit where its due. Whoever came up with the business model they use gets a ton of credit. Its a great business model. Tigole's implementations? Not so much. I think I speak for just about every raider on the low pop realms that Tigole's raid implementations were a terrible disappointment. None of us had a shot at the end game stuff.</div></div><hr />

This is obvious from all the lagging due to insufficient server resources, the release of an expansion with practically zero new raid content (TBC had brand new Kara, Gruul, Maggy, SSC, TK, while WotLK had retuned Naxx and a couple new raid bosses), and the fact that key personnel are moved to other projects.<br />

Huh? <br />
Before it was: <br />
portal to a city and pay a lot of money. <br />
Now it is:<br />
portal to a city and get it FOR FREE.<br />
or <br />
use a reagent which CANNOT COST MUCH (else you would again portal and respec for free)</div></div><hr />

No-one wants a lovefest where you blindly fawn over game designers. Tigole has a lot of responsibility anyway, and this has been a huge problem that he has failed to address.

Sure, criticise him for the thread and its content. That's different from deciding that every thing you disagree with or didn't like is personally Tigole's fault. I'm not fan-boying him - I don't know him. I'm encouraging fairness here - you don't actually know with even the remotest degree of certainty that Tigole is responsible for any specific thing, since there are a lot of people that work on these things. Your evidence that he is personally responsible with no assistance or influence (good or bad) from the many other people that work on these things is anecdotal at best. Therefore your direct criticism of this, that and the other in such a negative way and with the arrogance you displayed is laughable.</div></div><hr />

And this comment shows a complete lack of originality, irony, and wit. I'd like to offer you a &quot;nice try&quot; and a gold star, but I can't even do that. Best not to post if that's all you can come up with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a different philosophy then. Just because you operate in a public sphere does not entitle people to criticise you for things they cannot know for sure. You can only criticise someone on what they've said publically. And this is clearly what a lot of people are not doing. To lump sole responsibility of things you don't like onto one person simply because they may have said something in a forum is short-sighted and juvenile. He wasn't working alone, he has an entire team of people working with him and you have no way of knowing or verifying what was or was not lost in translation or what were and were not entirely his ideas.<br />

I disagree. I also think you're being deliberately obtuse. If you really think this we have no need to continue this discussion and I'm happy to say let's agree to disagree. Contempt is subjective and interpreted. I'm sure there were other people at the conference that heard the same comment and heard no contempt - if you can't acknowledge that possibility then there's something wrong. Additionally, there were plenty of Horde raids that advanced without fear ward before it was given to all priests.<br />

<br />
This goes for pretty much everyone slagging off someone they've never met or worked with personally (i.e. the desperately uninformed) - you know what they say &quot;those who can't do something, criticise it&quot;.<br />
<br />
The truth is unless you've worked with him, and I mean been in the same room with him while he's working and witnessed how he designs you have no idea how good or bad he is - you're speaking out of your backside, and it ain't roses. All you know is what you've witnessed as a consumer, which has 0 bearing on his abilities since you can never know how much of his design vision was truly changed along the way (or not, as they case may be).<br />
<br />
Sad, jealous, little bastards, really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong. You can tell how good a writer is by reading her novels. You can tell how good a carpenter is by looking at his tables. You can tell how good a network designer is by booting up, logging in and using his network under high-traffic conditions.<br />
<br />
And you can definitely tell how good a game designer is by playing his game.<br />
<br />
Fact is, WoW is the most carefully-designed, most polished game in the MMO market, and Blizzard has grown and cultivated its subscriber base with a long history of new content, but it is not without its major flaws. Chief among them are the major timesinks, some very poorly-thought-out class mechanics, and an end-game system that has only gradually improved to strike a balance between challenge and accessibility.<br />
<br />
We don't need to know the guy personally to know that he has a predilection for content barriers that require huge time investments to cross. Likewise, the idea that hybrids should be lesser versions of their &quot;pure&quot; counterparts is outdated, annoying to customers, and selfish.<br />
<br />
So the dude likes a hardcore playstyle and loves to reminisce about his &quot;glory days&quot; in EQ. No one cares. WoW is the biggest MMO, the product of a publicly-traded company, and there's an obligation to strike that balance between challenging and accessible, WITHOUT stupidity such as massive time-sinks, 5% penalties for hybrids, and those ridiculous (but common) cases of nerfs/buffs resulting from players who personally know/play with the developers.<br />
<br />
I suspect you're either a friend of Tigole or one of his biggest fanboys.</div></div><hr />

Good examples. I agree with you on each and every one. Where I disagree with you, and where your argument is flawed (or you're being deliberately obtuse) is that each of these endeavours is a solo one. A game designer isn't the sole worker on an endeavour such as WoW, is he? No. He has a team. A team of many tens, perhaps even closer to a hundred. <br />
<br />
Using your own wonderful examples, let me extend it and illustrate my point a little further, since you apparently suffer from similar comprehension deficits as others posting in this thread. You hire an architect to design your house. He does. You hire builders to build it. They do. There are problems with your house when you move in. Is this the architects (designers) fault, or is it the fault of the builders (executors of the design). Food for thought.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Again, design and translation to implementation are often two very different things. Again, you have no way of knowing if the translation of the design was faithful or not, unless you have evidence or citations to the contrary. Do you?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I suspect you're either a friend of Tigole or one of his biggest fanboys.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I've stated, I'm neither. I don't know him. However, if disbelieving me on that makes it easier for you to feel like you have the upper hand in a forum discussion in which you cannot show any objectivity whatsoever because of the certain damage it would cause to your ego, please, continue.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is - you don't know, you have no evidence, and your ideas about his alleged bad design are misplaced and erroneous without more data. Therefore, give the guy the benefit of the doubt - he's human too. See above example.<br />
<br />
And if you still don't get it after that, that's fine. We can just disagree. Unless that also bruises your ego.</div></div><hr />

Of course. But we know from his own statements that preferred those &quot;hardcore&quot; ways that Planetary mentioned, content barriers, class prejudice. So we can, in fact, blame him (and of course certain other people) for taking this &quot;design idea&quot; over to WoW. Even if his underlings came up with the specific details, he signed them and is thus responsible.</div></div><hr />

Definitely looking forward to Dualspec. I think it's really going to open up a lot of options for players and make the game that much more enjoyable. Can't wait to test it out on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I could be totally wrong since I honestly don't know, but I have to expect that the reagent costs will be extremely trivial, just like most reagents are. <br />
<br />
Thing is, respeccing became more expensive with the introduction of glyphs. Sure you can roll with the wrong glyphs if you so choose, but it doesn't make much sense if you are in a serious raiding or pvp environment. <br />
<br />
With the new dualspec, there's no more travel to a city. No more 50g a pop. No more buying glyphs or the mats to make them and having to LF w/e in trade. It's just a simple matter of having your glyphs and specs set up one time, having reagents on hand, and switching as needed. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's a brilliant idea and I can't wait to see it implemented.</div></div><hr />
