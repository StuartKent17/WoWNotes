and I wonder why the Horde can never get an decent and honorable leader, like Thrall was, he MUST be twisting in agony seeing<br />
the Horde being led by another Garosh, or even worse, not even Garosh would have done such an evil deed as this.<br />
<br />
Hope Blizzard can explain the Morally grey in this, cause I sure can't, there is no way to explain this as anything else<br />
than she made life her enemy and it should be that she made death and the lich king her enemy, but no, she lashes<br />
out at life and innocence and she deserves to burn in everlasting hell, death is to good for her, lock her up somewhere<br />
that she can see life moves on without her and kill off all the undead because nothing good has ever come from them<br />
or do I need to remind people of deathgate in wotlk, where they massacered everyone just to get to the lich king and they <br />
failed, did that stop them? no, they continued to brew even worse machines.<br />
<br />
Any Horde that remains with them storywise is nothing more than henchmen to an lunatic and they make themselves<br />
part of the crime and as much tainted as her in every evil deed.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, we played a major part in deposing our last leader. So &quot;mindlessly following another&quot; is purely false.</div></div><hr />

The shackles are just off now since the Legion was dealt with and she has unlimited political power. Not surprising at all, I didn't expect any different. If you expected something more, you have too much faith in Blizzard's story-telling ability. The funny thing will be when they try to do a 180 later and turn her into some sort of anti-hero, then it'll be laughably bad. But hey, they did it with Grom. lol</div></div><hr />

Still I dont think this cinematic would make or break Sylvanas as a morally gray character. In any case, I dont really care cos Im totally fine playing the evil guy :D<br />

On a side note, who would have thought that such a big and magical tree would catch fire with a few catapult fireballs. And also what kind of catapult can shot that distance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like it. But I highly doubt they would do the same thing again. It just seems like an idea that no game designer would agree on. Beside Alliance will invade Undercity so Horde will have a reason to rally against Alliance.</div></div><hr />

Using Warbringer video instead of ingame cinematic is lazy.Boring one note writing. Sorry i love wow but this is bad. Good world good story but their storytelling is utter garbage</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyky</div><div class="date">2018-07-31, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disappointing.<br />
<br />
Honestly the first thing I thought when I saw it. I'm very disappointed with this. Not just behind the story they're going with, but I'm very disappointed that Blizzard threw a Warbringer cinematic for something they said was going to be an &quot;epic cinematic&quot; at the past Blizzcon. Splash and frame art is not &quot;epic&quot;. While beautiful, it does not constitute filling the place of a real cinematic that depicts a very serious in game event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still don't think Sylvanas is 'evil' -- not morally grey, either however. Aylissa Silverarrow pushed Sylvanas, and Sylvanas reacted in haste by ordering the burning of Teldrassil to prove a point to Aylissa, rather than any actual desire to do it (you can see even Nathanos hesitates when the order is first given). <br />
<br />
<br />
BFA spoiler: <br />
I wonder if this will lead to Sylvanas killing Nathanos -- there is an interesting line in one of the opening Horde War Campaign quests, where Sylvanas orders Nathanos to keep her updated. She walks away, hesitates, turns to him and says 'Bye, Nathanos' in a really peculiar way. Perhaps he regrets this happening also.</div></div><hr />

The shackles are just off now since the Legion was dealt with and she has unlimited political power. Not surprising at all, I didn't expect any different. If you expected something more, you have too much faith in Blizzard's story-telling ability. The funny thing will be when they try to do a 180 later and turn her into some sort of anti-hero, then it'll be laughably bad. But hey, they did it with Grom. lol<br />

<br />
She is an undead, a banshee, her existince is filled with pain, she got an enormous power at her hands in the form of a horde of warriors. The story can move on to Garrosh's story (Which was a good story too) but as long as it's not a copy paste I'm gonna enjoy it. I hope they won't make this into a cheap hero's redemption and truly explore her character at least until the first patch of BfA.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if this will lead to Sylvanas killing Nathanos -- there is an interesting line in one of the opening Horde War Campaign quests, where Sylvanas orders Nathanos to keep her updated. She walks away, hesitates, turns to him and says 'Bye, Nathanos' in a really peculiar way. Perhaps he regrets this happening also.<br />

I think its worse for Sylvanas because she burned Teldrassil out of pure spite just to prove a point toe Aylissa. She used to be morally grey for practical reasons but this? this is Garrosh 2.0 shit here. Sylvanas is obviously doing a disservice to the Horde with even Nathanos hesitating, NATHANOS OF ALL PEOPLE! if anything despite Nathanos always following Syl regardless of what she is doing I don't think he is in danger from syl but the opposite, he is the only thing kinda of holding her down. I think Verok is going to have a field day with what happened.</div></div><hr />

She is the embodiment of death her soul was torn apart by arthas, so in a way we can blame the humans for this humans burned the tree<br />
<br />
TBH we can go further. Arthas was corrupted by the LK who was Nerzhul, an orc. How did the legion find the orcs? Because of draenei landing on Draenor.<br />
<br />
So its all Draenei's fault! We should blame Velen for that. And to think they are so close to each other....</div></div><hr />

<br />
furthermore...they are indeed Garroshing her and i couldn't be more disappointed. Sylvanas was interesting from all angles throughout every wow expansion until now. She made choices that were difficult, but necessary, i.e. val'kyr raising forsaken. the writing is super subpar here: she is a cartoon villain. this isn't practical at all, and she's usually HIGHLY practical. the whole reason for the attack was not to burn down teldrassil, and the writing right after it when she says &quot;i did not foresee this outcome&quot; is now totally moot. <br />
it's just a mess. i hate to say it again, but the thing is happening in alternate expansions where one is done superbly and then the next looks like absolute dogpile trash. super disappointed. hopefully lordaeron is better.</div></div><hr />

In fact people were reporting it on fire before it actually happened! Did you also notice the catapults had no people manning them? Almost like they were automatic missile launchers?

<br />
The cinematic tells a bad story because it feels Sylvanas took a sudden decision because one nightelf, one dying elf told her the she wont lose hope. <br />
<br />
What would be a better storytelling? In my opinion, that trying to kill Malfurion infuriated the nightelves and they started to beat the horde ass. In consequence, Sylvanas was desperate to break the morale of nightelves or she would lose the battle. The dying nightelf make her remember what destroyed her spirit: the total destruction of what she wanted to protect (the people and the sunwell). And thats why Sylvanas decided to destroyed the damn tree, so the elves doesnt have hope to recover anything because there was nothing to recover. <br />
<br />
In the end, Blizzard didnt do this and Sylvanas was jealous of a dying nightelf...it was all a caprice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's lazy writing to rehash the story of Sylvanas in a comic book themed animation and call that 'THE BIG CINEMATIC REVEAL'<br />
<br />
The actual quest chains were boring.<br />
<br />
The defense of Darnassus took 3 minutes when it should have taken 1 to show that what you're doing was hopeless to begin with.<br />
<br />
The scene with Malfurion felt like some lazy thing from Vanilla WoW, akin to that Theramore Quest Chain where you 'find the King.' <br />
<br />
The Cinematic for Teldrassil burning was lazy, and in fact it should have been an actual Scenario.<br />
<br />
Horde Players: Was it a Scenario on your side? Maybe that's what I'm missing, it might be a Scenario thing for Horde and next week a Scenario for Alliance.<br />
<br />
In either case there should have been two of them for each side, Teldrassil and Lorderon. <br />

For one, why would all those Blood Elves, Tauren, Orcs, Goblins and Trolls be totally okay with this?<br />
And second, Sylvanas never was a good character, but she always was a practical leader. So this action is totally against her character as there is nothing to gain from burning down that tree and everything too lose.<br />
<br />
But guess it's meant to build hype, so that the Alliance will have a reason to hate the Horde, and the Horde also have a reason to hate being part of the Horde. This way nobody cares about any conflict since, why would you care if something happened to the faction you hate (even though you are forced to play the caricature left of the faction you joined before bad writing killed your faction).</div></div><hr />

She kills civilians in their own CAPITAL city. She destroys the same city. She really &quot;was&quot; morally grey. But now, she made a 180 and turned pure evil. I refuse to accept this expansion as a real expansion. For all I care, this is just a filler that is not in the actual lore and just there until the real game starts in 2020.

They do rise up, and kick the Forsaken out of Lordaeron. Just because Sylvannas blights it to heck doesn't mean she's now failed twice.<br />

It was a gamble that failed. Her plan was to swiftly subjugate the Alliance, because perhaps she feared they'd lose a symmetric war (a war that they might've thought was inevitable). Think of it as a blixtkreig, only that it succeeded for the Germans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And even the “destroying hope”-thing backfires on her, because the Night elves go full Viet cong (As shown in folower missions and the post-questline phase of Darkshore), and she loses the open sewer she calls a city as well, so she’s evil and quite frankly incompetent (A case can be made for “Bat guano crazy” too, by now), so she won’t stay warchief for very much longer...</div></div><hr />

you do know that alliance did some bad stuff also right? the reason some races joined the horde was because alliance was basically bullying them.

<br />
My theory is that Bwonsamdi, the Loa of Death, told Vol'jin in his visions to make her Warchief, because he perhaps wants her work for him or something similar, her controlling all the controversial undead-stuff. He saw the path Sylvanas would take and took advantage of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is morally grey then? As I elaborated on previously, it looks like Sylvanas deems it necessary to break her enemies spirit, in order to dominate them and subsequently create &quot;peace&quot;. I see no indication of hatred, rather of her being cold and calculating. She doesn't do it as an effort to eliminate the living, such as Arthas, or destroying Azeroth as the Burning legion, or dominating all living races such as Garosh wanted to do with all non-orcs.</div></div><hr />

People always will rally. Nobody expected Night Elves to cut out their cunts and eat dirt. No matter how strong they want to fight against Sylvanas, they will always know there is no home to come back to. That their families are gone and their struggle lost purpose.</div></div><hr />

I know that setting such situaion in real life analogy is dumb in itself, but I wanted to illustrate how hopelessly stupid your opinion about the matter is.<br />
<br />
The US and Russia are not at war, the Alliance and the Horde are. Perhaps comparing to the USA's bombing of Japan is more apt.</div></div><hr />

Actually from all the in game tidbits over Legion and with the books, my theory is pretty sound. Look up the part where they talk about torches to light the way, if this is not a fucking torch I don't know what is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact we knew the tree would burn since like 2008 made me believe there would be a twist. Or a &quot;shadow&quot; part. But there, no doubt remains.<br />
<br />
Big twist indeed, Sylvanas is doing what she told us she'd do. Wow, Sylvanas doing something evil, who would've guessed</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NicoWolf</div><div class="date">2018-07-31, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When BfA was announced, I quit the game. The notion of another poorly written forced conflict between the Alliance and the Horde was the last straw on top of a big pile of straws. Legion had everything we needed, save for an underwhelming presentation of the biggest badass in the universe. Seriously, all this leading up to the final battle with Sargeras and...we don't get to fight at him at all?<br />
<br />
Ok. Fine.<br />
<br />
Fast forward a bit and now we have another conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, undoing all the good work that Legion pushed us toward. No coming together to fight some minor enemies while we struggle to build a lasting peace. Hell, they could have had a Defias Brotherhood styled story with a conspiracy working on both sides to foster war between the two factions; a la Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country. No huge raid bosses necessary mutated by whatever plot device was needed; just simple down-to-earth storytelling while Blizzard took the time to build a good solid proper foundation for bringing forth the Old Gods and their masters. We could have spent that time establishing and defending trade routes, flushing out those who would see peace fall. We could have seen an Azeroth where Night Elves are welcome in Silvermoon, Blood Elves sharing a table with the Draenei, Orcs and Humans working together to build homes. They could have introduced all kinds of solid material that we fight to keep now that we got it.<br />
<br />
Instead, we get Sylvanas becoming Garrosh.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's laziness with the story is steadily becoming on par with EA's approach to the consumer experience.</div></div><hr />

Amazing how you actually believe all this. Are you deaf? She wanted to invade the tree during the first seconds of the cinematic and then changed her mind because she got shaded. Don't be pathetic and accept the truth.</div></div><hr />

Tree was going to burn whether she did it or not, mark my words.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frosty3k</div><div class="date">2018-07-31, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is morally grey then? As I elaborated on previously, it looks like Sylvanas deems it necessary to break her enemies spirit, in order to dominate them and subsequently create &quot;peace&quot;. I see no indication of hatred, rather of her being cold and calculating. She doesn't do it as an effort to eliminate the living, such as Arthas, or destroying Azeroth as the Burning legion, or dominating all living races such as Garosh wanted to do with all non-orcs.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas' true intent is to convert the living into more forsaken. Based on the lore in the latest novel, it makes that point clear. She does in fact do it to eliminate the living. That isn't to say she's against all life (but maybe she really is), but she certainly wants to see the alliance burn.<br />
<br />
Morally grey is something that you would do if there was true purpose behind doing it to improve the world but in doing so you understood that it required a bad act to be performed. Ex: killing Hitler when he was a baby would make the world a better place in the future, but the act itself is extremely bad. It's when you understand what you're doing is bad but will bring good. Sylvanas simply thinks it's the path to making the world she wants without care about who she's hurting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess someone will tell you we're missing Azshara's Warbringer, but I don't really see what it can tell about this &quot;War of Thorns&quot;...</div></div><hr />

Nobody expected Night Elves to cut out their cunts and eat dirt. No matter how strong they want to fight against Sylvanas, they will always know there is no home to come back to. That their families are gone and their struggle lost purpose.<br />
<br />
Agreed also in these cases revenge becomes a much more prevalent imperative over lost and despair, if you are fighting someone the last thing you want is for them to feel they got nothing left to lose.</div></div><hr />

Nobody cares about the burning itself. What was important mattered. If a 3dparty like Azshara did it then it would be different. Even if Sylvanas didnt burn it she would still be responsible for creating the necessary conditions for the burning. She is accountable.</div></div><hr />

But nice Blizzard. You need more reasons to kill another warchief? How many have we lost in the last 10 years? Oh, i forgot, you let Christie &quot;Alliance&quot; Golden write your bad storylines now. <br />
It feels like a bad fanfic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She will be leaving the Horde at the end of the expansion to train Dark Rangers for both factions anyways, and potentially taking her sisters with her dead or alive.</div></div><hr />
