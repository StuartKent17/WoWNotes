Blizzcast isn't here to give new information<br />
A lot of players have been disappointed by yesterday's Blizzcast, here is a small explanation.<br />
Thanks for the feedback! I'm sorry if there was some hype from somewhere that this was going to be providing huge exclusive information, that just isn't the case. In fact, it's quite likely that the next BlizzCast won't even mention World of Warcraft. The podcast itself is intended to be &quot;a glimpse of what it is like to make the games you love from their (employees) perspective&quot;, and not necessarily as a way to make announcements or press releases. Most &quot;big news&quot; is usually given as exclusives to magazines or websites, of course there are quite a lot of people that don't already know that information, and in those cases the podcast will provide some new info on Sunwell, if it doesn't for you then hopefully you enjoyed the other parts.<br />
<br />
Also, to our credit, we'll be able to pump these out a little quicker in the future so there won't be such a gap between information releases and the BlizzCast episodes if they do contain some tidbits.<br />
<br />
<br />
US Realm - Free character transfer<br />
US Realms are getting their free transfers too, with a lot more servers involved than the one posted for the european players yesterday.<br />
<br />
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to lower populated realms, assisting in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Thursday, January 10 at 3:00 PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Thursday, January 17 at 3:00 PM PST.<br />
<br />
In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br />
<br />
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.<br />

More bug reports, and a small information about Death Knights.<br />
Deathknights races<br />
Developpers don't currently plan on limiting racial choice for when you create your Deathknight. You don't turn your character into a Deathknight, but instead create a new one. (Basically, you could perfectly create a Gnome Deathknight even if your main character is a Draenei) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3773337274&amp;postId=38812315126&amp;sid=1#23))<br />

Chat bubbles disappearing when the interface is hidden<br />
Ever since the 2.3 patch, chat bubbles disappear when you turn the interface off. This was changed intentionally, but in a future patch there will probably be a new option that will allow you to turn them back on.

Playing in Arenas / Hated reputation with the Steamwheedle Cartel<br />
Some arena NPCs are intended to be on goblin factions and hostile to Bloodsail Buccaneers, but there should be at least one vendor and one arena master that is friendly to everyone. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3773367014&amp;postId=38813018329&amp;sid=1#4))<br />

Blade's edge mountain eating/drinking interruptions<br />
The bug causing people to stand up in Blade's Edge Mountains and interrupting their eating/drinking was fixed but has been reintroduced with the 2.3.2 patch, devs are re-investigating the cause.

Undead female weapons misaligned.<br />
In 2.3.2 when the weapons on an undead female are unsheathed, the mainhand weapon will angle downward, while the offhand will point straight ahead, parallel to the ground. This should be fixed in an upcoming patch. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881819045&amp;postId=38813017192&amp;sid=1#1))</div></div><hr />

This can really be annoying when I'm trying to grind my Ogri'la/ Skyguard dailies on my pally. I'm just wondering how the hell did they managed to revert it by accident, and not notice until it went live? ::)</div></div><hr />

That just wasn't fair to get us all hyped up like that, they made it seem like it would explain everything in 2.4 and more about the lore behind the new instance and whats going on etc., but no Blizz had to shoot us down &gt;&lt;<br />

<br />
Granted it's not a WoWcast but rather covers all Blizzard stuff; the interview with Samwise for example was really nice. However, given how big WoW is, how it's hosted by WoW CMs, and how they know everybody has been starved for 2.4 AND WotLK information, they certainly could've made an effort that goes a little beyond rehashing the same stuff Kalgan revealed in that interview with a Swedish zine over 3 weeks ago (as if they didn't know that'd go around the world in a few hours).<br />
<br />
4 screenshots of Sunwell Plateau and some minor information about the ilevel of epics dropping in the 5-man wing is all we got so far. How on Earth did they think they wouldn't get bashed for that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, undead female weapons/offhands were angled downwards for years until 2.3, where offhand then appeared to be in the right angle.<br />
There is one more 'bug' with one shoulder not moving in using/crafting animation, which is as old as the weapon angle problem, but since I can't post on US forums.. well, you get the point.</div></div><hr />

Sound like you are pretty upset over not hearing more info about the next patch.<br />
<br />
I try to imagine why you would get so upset...<br />
<br />
Are you getting bored with the game and hoping that the next patch has enough for you to justify yourself to continue playing?</div></div><hr />

Thank you for espressing my thoughts on this one.<br />
We are hardcore. All of us. Don't need to admit it, we know it. 2.4 lands on PTR and the day it does EVERY little piece of info will be on this site. Screenshots too. We are hardcore. This is mass media. Different stuff. :]</div></div><hr />
