Anyway, PTR servers will be available very soon.<br />
Well, my point in the last couple of post I've made is to say that I can't give a straight answer, not because I've been instructed not to, but because we don't have a definite ETA right now. The process to get them running is under way, and we're shooting to get them up asap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All copies for your Live Characters have been reset, so now you have to do it again.<br />
I give it about 20-30 minutes before the Queue is full.<br />
<br />
The PTR Forums are down because they're filling it up with stickies,<br />
reason might be because annoying kids are spamming it with &quot;WHER R OUR PREMADEZ?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Maybe not a step back, as LOLuMAD said, a lot of people were spamming the forum saying the PTR is not working, asking for pre-mades etc. The forum may not be viewable by us, but they are probably filling it with their usual sticky posts.</div></div><hr />

It was some feral druid with like 1.8K ap in greens, blue, and at 1300 rating. I did lol so much.<br />
<br />
And the EU copies didn't get reset (yet).<br />
<br />
EDIT: And oh yeah, 1000 posts 8)<br />
Damn.... i post too much don't i ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes but someone further down also posted saying they enjoyed playing premades and it was fun tryo=ing out other classes..and he had full epics, and was in a 2v2 with 2600+ rating, 3v3 2300+, so what?<br />
<br />
Lets not start making the thread turn into a PTR thread moaning about &quot;noobs&quot; asking for premades.</div></div><hr />

Been a good policy for past PTRs to make sure you make a character on the PTR first then go and copy your character over. Once you've used up your 4 thats till the next PTR so be carefull :D</div></div><hr />

I usually copy 1 as a tester. Once that has worked I pass all the gold I have on live to one of my characters I want to copy, then copy it / them, using the last 3 copies, which gives me 3x the gold I had to mess around with, to try out new specs etc.</div></div><hr />

Lolz . Your character copys get reset for every PTR. Such is life.<br />
<br />
Happens each PTR. Their character copy page gets flooded. It goes down.<br />
<br />
My advice : wait till you see a sticky in the PTR forums about the actual PTR servers being up. A little patience goes a long way , especially for a service you don't pay for :D</div></div><hr />

Well yeh, but remember the 1-pot-per-fight nerf? And there's only going to be 3 or so bosses available for testing at a time. So it's not like we'll need as many pots and flasks as normal.<br />
<br />
Then again, I suppose it gives people plenty of time to find all the new bugs they're created in the rest of the content.</div></div><hr />

And there's only going to be 3 or so bosses available for testing at a time. So it's not like we'll need as many pots and flasks as normal.<br />
<br />
Then again, I suppose it gives people plenty of time to find all the new bugs they're created in the rest of the content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aye ofcourse, but i hope its a bit more challenging then naxx so we might could use a few extra xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blame yourself, not Blizz. No one told you it was okay for you to copy anything to the PTR yet, fool. The only thing GAY here was your gay-ass idea that you were gonna be the first on the PTR and get the drop on everyone else. I don't feel sorry for any of those stupid people that screwed themselves. I bet you're one of those guys in the raid thats always dying from pulling the Boss\mob off the Tank cuz you didn't listen to your Raid Leaders command to start DPS. In the end you got what you deserved. You're just one less bozo causing net traffic on the server that I don't have to worry about! LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
If not then maybe someone can post the 3.1 ptr download link ^^</div></div><hr />
