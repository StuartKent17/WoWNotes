No you just know that art and taste is subjective.<br />
Remember t1 for example... Bright yellow banana paladin set, volcano pink spandex shaman set, &quot;a bush on my head&quot; druid set and so on.<br />

If it's so then I think the Shaman set is one of the best t12. The warlock is horrible. What's the deal with plate-like cloth pieces? :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">creepygnome</div><div class="date">2011-05-13, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the robes to both of them, and am glad that they put some extra detail in the pattern on the lock robe for a change. But are they now increasing the helm size too? It seems every helm in this Tier is HUGE compared to the head. I understand a helmet being large enough to fit over a head, but these are kinda overdoing it. Okay, really over doing it. <br />
Especially when it comes to the collars they are adding to so many of the helms this tier. I don't think I would have the helm show for any of these sets.</div></div><hr />

Shaman's got GREAT shoulders. Warlock's don't look that bad, but head is definitely a shame.<br />

All in all, warlock's set (the one I care about) looks kinda like Haribo jellies... I guess I'll live. I like the spiderwebs on the shoulders. But colors... so much jelly hunger awakens...</div></div><hr />

But the detail in the design, especially compared to other class teirs atm, is great. Can't wait to see my toon sporting this set!<br />
<br />
Also I hope they let dps gear (that isnt tier) have the lock tier look this time too. Sporting mage shoulders, for instance, whilst I wait my turn for my teir shoulders has made my toon look terrible. I noticed the lock teir skin was on SPIRIT gear instead O_O.</div></div><hr />

How is it obvous? I mean HOW? I fail to see the lack of detail.

Keep old tier, such as tier 8. When defeating a new boss you get a token in which you can either infuse your current tier to change its stats, or turn in to a vendor to get this new shit they call gear. I do not want to looking like spiderman ON FIRE. Wtf is that. I'd be forever happy with this having good stats <br />

You apparently don't have any sense of graphical design, nor creativity. I'll give you that the mage set isn't outstanding, but still more creative I think then the lock. Lock T12 looks more like a dungeon set then tier gear. You think they spent an equal amount of time on the locks set then say.......paladin, or priest...hunter?<br />

I'll answer that question for you......no.<br />

<br />
Warlock set in just AMAZING!!!<br />
<br />
Sometimes you guys forget that the sets should remember the place where you get then, ans so far these set package is just amazing.<br />
<br />
Fire themed sets, form a Fire themed raid content, what more do you want?<br />
<br />
It have Lava Giants, and Lava Spiders, so all the sets so far looks like they can actually drop from that place.<br />
<br />
anyway, as aways haters gonna hate...<br />
<br />
If you kill a dragon you will get a dragonscale...<br />
not, If you kill a dragon you will get a chocolate bar...<br />
<br />
Come on... wow is action-mmorpg, but still RPG, fire place with fire creatures = fire themed sets based on the cratures there.</div></div><hr />

While i love most of the sets, especially pally and hunter the lock and priest sets could stand to be a little more interesting. I was excited when i heard the set was going to be &quot;spidery&quot; though i imagined something closer to t6, this is a thorough let down, hopefully it at least looks better on gnomes</div></div><hr />

I'll give you that the mage set isn't outstanding, but still more creative I think then the lock. Lock T12 looks more like a dungeon set then tier gear. You think they spent an equal amount of time on the locks set then say.......paladin, or priest...hunter?<br />
<br />
I'll answer that question for you......no.<br />
<br />
And having a spiders fiery glowing ass on top of my head, just not cool at all.<br />
<br />
And you do hey? Its all opinion hunny. And in my opinion it looks like more work went into it than half of the other teirs that were produced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overall this whole tier is not my style. I find most of them just plain ugly and uninspired. They are essentially all the same...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanjol</div><div class="date">2011-05-13, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warlock set isn't &quot;sinister&quot; enough for my taste but they did ok with the spider theme. If you look closely at the screen shot shoulder animation on warlock a fiery spider web appears to be bursting off which is pretty cool in my opinion. Maybe the heroic color scheme will do the set more justice but considering it is themed after and ugly magma spider I imagined a more corrupt lava oozing tier for locks. <br />
<br />
As my main is a shammy I think their set is alright. I'm most excited to see it on a goblin with all its animated goodness. I wonder if anyone else looking at it is thinking FIERY SPACE MARINE though, I mean seriously just imagine a bubble dome visor between the circle around the neck from the shoulders to the crown and BAM! instant Shammy astronaut! O well cant win em all but I'm not completely let down. <br />
<br />
In my overall opinion the sets are too clean for a game theme that is based on a shattered world and a new content patch that is based on something as unpredictable and fierce as fire. Give us something bold, corrupted, and chaotic! Like someone said before there was the shammy &quot;Cataclysm&quot; set in BC (Tier 5 I believe). Make some lava pouring out of that or some other animation and then we are talking. Maybe my idea fit the Horde better as the tend to be a more crude looking race. Blizz should go back and do faction related tier pieces as well. Nobel and clean for Alliance, Crude and corrupt for the Horde!<br />
<br />
Ok done putting my 2 cents in....well about a buck fifty at this point. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder so Im sure we will continue to get mixed reviews for this tier.</div></div><hr />

So far this expansion I'm not impressed with any Tier set for any class.<br />
My 2 cents...<br />
Depending on Druid shoulders, Shaman set may beat it out for candidate of worst T12 set.<br />
People hating on the lock set, it's not that bad. You have to look at it as a whole and get the theme. The spider helm is kind of neat once you do that.<br />
Pally T12 is probably the best looking, followed by the Mage set. (simple yet elegant)<br />
<br />
PvP gear on the other hand looks damn awesome for a few classes.</div></div><hr />

Every piece is oversized with thick metallic edging making them all have a plate feel. They don’t speak to their individual classes. If they weren’t labeled I don’t think anyone would know which belonged to which class. Maybe it is because they are early models and haven’t been refined yet, but the details in the individual pieces look very flat and one dimensional. Take the priest model for example, the chest piece looks like a t-shirt that had a design painted on it. I sure hope the final product looks better than this. With all the work that’s being put into other places of WoW, and all the cool models we’re seeing from other games, Blizzard really needs to step up their game and not put up such a sad effort.</div></div><hr />

This set is simply beautiful. To all you mainstream-whiners, get the fuck out of this tier-debate you don't know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
As for warlock, head/shoulderpiece was out of proportion, otherwise nicely themed I'd say.<br />
<br />
Guess what all these sets have in common:<br />

btw...really...lock set is horrible. When I read about &quot;spider themed set&quot; I imagined something with 8 eyes, lot of legs and &quot;OMG&quot; helm and spaulders. Nothing...only ugly spiders with some fire and spiderman texture... shame on designers...</div></div><hr />

I actually quite like the shaman set (being a shaman player). compared to what they gave us as tier 11, this is a nice change of pace, the only problem with the shaman set is the theme, though shaman armor is mail to make the majority of the art just plain mail armor looks a tad lazy, but the other effects and design looks swell, you win some you lose some.<br />
<br />
All in all, a welcomed tier =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Growing a pair&quot; = shutting up and taking whatever you're given from a paid service? Since when?<br />
<br />
It's like saying,<br />
&quot;So the flowers you had delivered to your girlfriend were wilted. Stop complaining about stuff that doesn't really matter. Deal with it, grow a pair.&quot;<br />
or<br />
&quot;So the painters you hired used the wrong colors. Stop complaining about stuff that doesn't really matter. Deal with it, grow a pair.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a video game, aesthetic appeal is important. People are going to be staring at this fugly gear for six freaking months. How is that not a legit reason to complain? And in case you hadn't noticed, people ARE leaving - and it's not a good thing for the game, no matter what some people would like to believe.</div></div><hr />

I think it supposed to be a volcano, not a tree. I'd love to see a video of the Shaman set fire animations though. The only thing I don't like about it the fact that we've got another wrestler style belt, they look horrendous. :(<br />
<br />
IMO the Warlock one would look a bit better if it didn't have the hood bit obscuring most of the face - I actually really like the helm and how it's shaped like a spider.</div></div><hr />

What's up with the tier sets so far this expansion? They're bleh! The first 2 tiers of WoTLK were pretty damn nice. I envisioned something leggy and much more prominent webbing when they talked about the Warlock tier in the interview. This is more suiting for PVP gear than it is PVE tier sets. I dunno, maybe they're pulling out the big guns for the other tiers. When we're doing the raids in Vash with the old god and stuff.... I dunno... Warlock always pulls thru but it's severely lacking IMO. I think Druid would have to be my favorite out of all of them.</div></div><hr />
