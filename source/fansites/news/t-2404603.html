The pre-expansion patch on the PTR has updated to include the quest chain that leads to our Artifact Weapons becoming inactive as we head into Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Spoilers: When you log into the PTR, you are given the quest The Speaker's Call which has you travel to Silithus and talk to the flight master of your respective faction's hub in order to get a ride up to your faction's gunship. Magni is on board with a select number of influential Legion NPCs (based on your faction) who also have Artifact weapons.<br />

<br />
Upon turn in, you will receive the quest The Power in Our Hands which requires you to speak to Magni to initiate a cutscene in which you and the other NPCs use your Artifact Weapons to drain the energy from Sargeras's sword and stabilize the wound. <br />

<br />
Completing these quests will still allow you to use your Artifact Weapon, but all traits and abilities attached to it will become disabled, including those from the Netherlight Crucible and your relics. Relics can still be slotted into the weapon, but all they do is increase the item level of the weapon. Currently Artifact weapons are disabled upon login to the PTR, so you can't just avoid doing the quest to keep your traits. <br />

I'd assume that by default, the artifacts are disabled as soon as pre-patch hits. The questline just makes it official. Otherwise there would be no point in doing it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this was already datamined during 7.3.5 alongside with artifact instability. Its not a new thing, its just that they made it available on PTR.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard can make this as a scenario or mandatory in a quest chain.For example:- When legion was launched , a player had no option of avoiding the starting scenario of broken shore.</div></div><hr />

Thankfully, they've enabled the option to skip Lordaeron after one character completes it. Although, the reward for completing the scenario is like 150k XP on the PTR, so I'd do it to get a jump on leveling if I were you.</div></div><hr />

My bad, I mean like lore wise. If it only displays so many. Like are we to assume that our off spec artifact weapons also get channeled while in our bags? Seems strange to tell us we get a &quot;big send off&quot; then give us this. Maybe there will be more RP stuff after this initial power down.

<br />
I imagine once the expansion launches your artefact would automatically be disabled. Also need to remember though that the stat squish would be put into effect, so even if your artefact was still active it wouldn't be as effective as it used to be.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have missed the part where it specifically says &quot;based on your faction.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're a Horde character, only Horde characters appear. If you're an Alliance character, only Alliance characters appear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Magni is on board with a select number of influential Legion NPCs (based on your faction) who also have Artifact weapons.</div></div><hr />

There was supposed to be this whole thing where the artifact becomes unstable, gaining AP passively rapidly until it eventually overheats and dies, basically. But it looks like they're scrapping the whole instability phase by releasing the quest with 8.0 when all Artifacts are depowered already.</div></div><hr />

You get the XP regardless last I checked so that's a moot point. Unless you mean something than the experience you get from turning in the quest?</div></div><hr />

I think it's because the player character in this case is Alliance. The ship itself is Alliance as well.<br />
But so far I haven't found if things change when playing as Horde.<br />
<br />

<br />
so is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx1nmUS4zSk <br />
<br />
not going to happen now ?<br />
I think we will get it, yes.<br />
<br />
Notice that the artifact send-off is active in PTR, which is already 8.0, and thus the artifacts have no traits anymore.<br />
<br />
But I think the actual quest will be activate in the last week(s) of 7.3.5, instead. We will do the quest and the artifact will get unstable. Then 8.0 hits and the artifact has lost its power.</div></div><hr />

Me too - I mean we are all donating 2 years of effort to 'kill' that big sword, the least that could have happened is that we get more than 30 seconds of 'meh' and 30 gold for the two quests.<br />

It just seemed lame ... given what was happening.<br />

<br />
<br />
Will we be able to use the dead artifact on other specs then?<br />

No - it was explained that the spec artefact weapon is tied to the spell animations for that spec, which is also why you won't be able to even use an X-mog of it in the future cross spec.</div></div><hr />

Main difference is a) that grind lasted artificially during all expansion and b) you don t get to keep anything related to it (transmog isn t linked to AP).<br />

You didn’t spend the whole expan geting the same traits for your artifact either though more traits were added with tiers it’s no different then replacing a set from raid to raid. Though you are right you got to keep the sets for a bit while leveling but even then they didn’t last long.<br />

The weapon, I suppose isn't gone, nor inert, its just basically how you found it with no artifact power at all. The first trait is the only thing missing I suppose (it should keep that really, unless that was activated by Artifact power)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except it is. When you farm gear/Tier sets, they remain useful a decent ways into the next expansion and even when you replace them, you'll always have that appearance to transmogrify. There's absolutely nothing you can do with Artifact Power beyond empowering your weapon--which they're removing. They're keeping this same system in for Battle for Azeroth and there's a good chance they'll keep trying to push it for every expansion thereafter.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Still no word on &quot;broken&quot;skins either, eh? I had hoped they'd at least give out one final round of artefact skins for every participant in the questline that gives you a shattered/broken skin for your weapon as the final form.

<br />
In the end, the Artifact Weapon with the relics will be a nice stat stick into BfA. The rest of the Legendary items will de-power at level 115, losing their effects. By that point the gear you should be getting will start to replace most people's Argus gear, most if not all LFR gear and even normal tier raid gear before Argus himself. That's stuff from the second zone you complete in BfA. By the third zone you should be level 120 (easily) and be getting gear that outdoes about everything you have in Legion....like most other expansions. You might have one or two pieces that are really good, or you are a Mythic Raider, than you probably will still have a few things when you hit 120, but Heroics should replace everything before going to Raid in BfA. Especially the Azerite Gear slots.<br />
<br />
Finding a good replacement weapon might take several levels even with your Artifact Stick of Power.</div></div><hr />

Kind of typical for any gear that you get during an expansion BUT it does make me glad I decided to take a break away from Legion and only returned after they made changes to Artifact Knowledge etc. Highly likely I will probably level a character to max but then take a break from BFA as well until most time gates are removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A serious question:Do you honestly think it works that way? The moment the patch goes live all artefact traits are disabled. While the OP phrased it terribly (as if it wasn't intended), the intent here is clearly to have all weapons being disabled once the patch hits no matter if you did the quest or not, otherwise no one would do the quest as it would just serve to weaken you.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
pretty shitty cinematic. I would've expected something far more epic.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't even have been difficult imho. Scrap the stupid ugly alliance airship, place the various order halls around the sword with the most notable NPCs being in attendence. Make it so that you have to go to your order hall's camp, decide on a weapon you yourself wield, &quot;give&quot; the remaining two (or 3) to your champions, only show yourself and your champions sucking up the sword and only show the raised weapons for the other order halls, add maybe some extra spell effects (more than just the black beams) to the whole ritual (or turn it into one in the first place) and seal away Gorribals' power. <br />
<br />
All of that could be made dynamical as well. In the end the whole thing is just disapointing, from what happens to how it is framed. <br />
<br />
Btw, I'm really starting to hate these ingame cutscenes more and more, because I have yet to see one that doesn't look like shit.</div></div><hr />

Well<br />
a) - there was no grind required at all in Legion for AP, they had systems in place to ensure you didn't need to grind.<br />
b) - we've always given up huge amounts of obtained gear generally obtained via raids etc between expansions.<br />
<br />
However, this is still different<br />
<br />
Previously - the items we'd got in the expansion kept working as they were for the most part until we levelled up into the next expansion.<br />
This time - the artefact is going to die before we even get into the next expansion and even if we stay at level 110 and never buy 120.<br />

The retirement of the artifact weapons is the retardest thing in game in years. Loosing so much power and skill without any compensation... I hate this change.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with the weapons retiring, however:<br />
<br />
1. The weapon should retire when you start you quest into the next expansion - my level 110 alt that is still playing through legion content in 6 months should still have the artefact.<br />
2. There should be more than a lame 2 second cut scene ... should be a huge event <br />
3. There should be more than 2 x 20g quest rewards... I think trading your AP in for an appropriate amount of azurite based on your AP invested<br />
4. Your most powerful item (Artefact) shouldn't suddenly become your weakest item. It should still be as powerful as your legendaries at least.</div></div><hr />

I was really hoping for some better quality content... They could've easily fit a one-boss dungeon or raid inside the Sword (there is already the dungeon-entrance-like portal), where you have to fight some titan construct or fel energy to effectively drain the power of the sword, with the &quot;artifact-pointing-upward&quot; part as ExtraActionButton in the last 2% of the thing.</div></div><hr />

What? At the beginning you had to rush 52 points. Every decent guild was demanding 52 points. You had to grind it.<br />
After they've reworked the system, you still had to grind up to 75 to get every single trait. Faster or slower, you HAD to GRIND ap!</div></div><hr />

No - at the beginning those who didn't understand maths may have chosen to rush 52 points.<br />
<br />
However you did in no way ever have to rush 52 points. That's just the objective truth. I'm at 81 now and haven't had to do a single AP grind to get there.<br />

We knew from day 1 that the artifacts were going away when the expansion ended.</div></div><hr />

I said instantly reset ... not 'becomes useless when you out level it'.<br />

<br />
We knew from day 1 that artefacts would be defunct .... not that they were going to cease to exist even for legion level characters.</div></div><hr />

Huh? And you base this on what? So far we know there will be world quests in Darkshore, I think very likely they will offer catch up stuff like experience.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping this patch includes the removal of gold missions from class hall. Why? I need a break lol. A month or more not having to use the mission boards on all my characters would be such a relief. It's literally the only thing I do in wow nowadays, farm resources to make sure all my 50 class halls are ready, every day. It's literally a full time job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From May 3rd:<br />
Someone else mentioned it before, but with regard to how much time we have to complete the mage tower, will the ability to earn mage tower appearances go away at the PRE-PATCH release OR the actual BFA Launch in August?<br />
<br />
It'll be the pre patch.</div></div><hr />
