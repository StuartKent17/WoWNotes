Another huge recap is on its way and tons of previews based on the info we got there will follow, there was also an interesting post by Zarhym on new character models.<br />
Art Director Chris Robinson spoke on this just moments ago at the BlizzCon Open Q&amp;A panel. It was in reply to an attendee who brought up that, in the art panel, it was explained that the pandaren model has 10 times the bone structures of the classic races, allowing for many more facial animations.<br />
<br />
To paraphrase his statement -- which isn't too different from what I've said here on the forums before -- we absolutely plan on updating the existing models. As Chris mentioned, we want to make sure we preserve the look and feel of the original models players have come to know and love, while vastly improving their model and animation quality to be more in-line with the newer races.<br />
<br />
We're not going to hide behind the statement that too many players will get mad if we tamper with their models, but it's a concern -- not a concern that's going to stop us from doing it, however. I want to stress as well that it's a massive undertaking to go back and do this. And to a lot of people it's something that won't be considered shiny new content. But not only do we hear the masses of players calling for this update, we really feel it's time to bring them up to par with newer models as well.<br />
<br />
The game continues to age, but as we have no plans of slowing down on development any time in the near future, we want to keep updating and polishing it to stand the test of time (again, without sacrificing the look and feel which has brought players in over the years).<br />
<br />
<br />
Update - Annnnd we're done. <br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Lore and Story Q&amp;A<br />
(Red Shirt Guy) Thanks for putting a representation of me in the game! In Gilneas, the questlines end with the strong feeling of to be continued and that we are going back, the only zone that had that feel was Hyjal and we went back there too. Are we going back to Gilneas too?<br />
It would be fun to go back to Gilneas, its not on the cards right away but we just love the way the area feels. The zone has its very own story and it's a little hard to integrate to the rest of the world. <br />
<br />
You did not mention a world PvP zone for MoP, maybe that could be the World PvP area for MoP?<br />
The war between the Horde and Alliance will really heat up in Pandaria every patch, so we are looking forward to integrating that.<br />
<br />
What happened to Arthas's body? What happened to Illidan's body? What about Kael'thas?<br />
It is likely we will bring Illidan back, not so much for Kael'thas, he already had his come back. Arthas's body is somewhere but we don't really know where.<br />
<br />
What is the motivation that the Pandaren have for fighting each other?<br />
Something that is hard to get across in the demos is that the pandaren that live on the turtle have been seperated from the pandaren on the mainland for ages. Its almost like a splinter culture. They are the ones that you as players you are going to play. They are going out to the world. You can see these events in the 1-10 experience. By the time your Pandaren gets to 85/90 you have traveled the world fighting for the Aliance and Horde. <br />
<br />
When the Pandaren meet eachother on the field they are more of WHATS UP instead of being pissed at eachother. They would probably be drinking beer right after. All the sort of anger, hatred and other negative energies become the Sha. It literally can come and bite you in the butt. They dont want to bring all that bad bagage into a fight. When a Pandaren fights he fights to reach a conclusion. When things are settled you take a beer.<br />
<br />
You wrote the book Blood and Honor, are you planning on writing something else in the future?<br />
Writing made me nervous and was exciting, it is different than the writing we have to do for the game but maybe one day I will do another.<br />
<br />
This question is regarding Lordaeron, I want to know what happened to Arthas s sister, what happened to her?<br />
We are thinking about it. We dont really have a plan but we have been talking about her forever. There were some hooks in the RPG line but no current plans. While thats on my mind, how many RPers are there in the audience?<br />
<br />
We said the RPG line was non canonical but there are some really good bits in those books so all I would say that they are broadly non-canonical but there are lots of bits in there that we want to use. At some point we might put some project together to some ideas that we want to say yes or no on. Admiral Proudmore has some elf baby so that wont actually go through for example.<br />
<br />
Why have characters like Krasus, Khadgar, and especially Rhonin that have been directly tied to the Black Dragonflight not been in Cataclysm?<br />
A lot of time we'll have stories in the novel that feel like they should continue in the game but we decide to not include them in the game because it would be really hard to make everybody catch up on the whole story. <br />
<br />
Whatever happened to the crown of menethil, or is that something we are going to find out about?<br />
Terenas Crown? Legendary loot drop. <br />
<br />
Tyrande was a strong character, but hasn't done anything much recently, why?<br />
Thrall took an entire expansion to add in, we haden't gotten to him before that. Tyrande is the same way, we haven't gotten around to it yet. We don't intend on leaving her being a weak character, she will get her turn when we can get to it.<br />
<br />
Jaina proudmoore will also get some love pretty soon. Thrall isn't done yet either, he isn't weak. Champion level Thrall is on the way.<br />
<br />
This panel has said that Pandarians have no sense of hatred. How does it make sense for a Pandaren to be a Warlock, but not a druid?<br />
If that is true, I do not like it. I usually get overruled when it comes to game design. These classes, Warlock, Deathknight are not choosing this life. If they can indeed roll Warlock, it is not impossible for them to not hate. <br />
<br />
Why cant they roll Druid then? The bear as a bear argument is crap.<br />
Monday morning we will yell at the design dudes. Pandaria was not there during the Sundering so I guess Cenarion was not there teaching them. I still think druids are out, that might change though.<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul is inconsistent with a lot of lore or changes a lot of lore, how does that work?<br />
Wait and see.<br />
<br />
Arthas's mother was mentioned in the WotLK novel, there was never any mention to what happened to her. Was he a Mamas boy that he did not kill her?<br />
We have not officially -made that up- yet, we have not crafted her fate. My impression from WC3 is that it works better if she would have died somewhere before the fall of Lordaeron. Killing Terenas is pretty striking, I just think it diminishes the moment if he goes on a Charlie Manson spree. <br />
<br />
..or you kill her and you get a legendary crown. (Reference to earlier question) ... but probably not! <br />
<br />
Is it safe to assume his mum was killed previously by Arthas' corruption?<br />
It is something we need to talk about.<br />
<br />
I just read the Sylvanas Windrunner short story, what happened to the Shards of Frostmourne?<br />
It wasn't specifically adressed in the story, I don't think we've adressed it in the lore. Some very smart people in the lore picked these things up and took them somewhere safe and I imagine there might be some shenanigans one day, with some people trying to reforge it one day, and that's all I know about it ...<br />
<br />
My question is about Algalon, he kind of goes into a mid-life crisis he seems to wonder how you can differ from the Titan plan, then he decides more than one hour a week to see what makes us tick. What is he up to? Are there more of his kind to see what he is up to?<br />
We don't know, it wasn't addressed in the story or lore. We might see someone reforging it in the future. Good question.. hmm.. the whole titan storyline.. who those folks are, what they are doing in the universe. Are they still alive? Do they have a plan if the world goes south? The titan storyline throughout WoW is something that needs to play out during a long time. Its not like we will have titans in two expansions. They are from somewhere really exotic. Not sure how to leveraget them into the timeline again, I loved what we did with in WotLK and Cataclysm. Ill riff a little bit and tell you that there are things about TBC that I really really loved. Shattered planets in the sky and etherals running around.. but as we talked to the community people wanted to kill kobolds and stuff thats what fantasy means to them...<br />
<br />
There is a part of me that just wants to launch into the universe. Are the titans still moving out there? Is the Burning Legion still out there? I want to go to Argus. How badass would it be if there was a shiny fleet of Draenei out there... oh technically thats Protoss. Its just a matter of feeling it out. We have a lot of time with this game. Let me just ask you all.. Is anyone here into the cosmic stuff?<br />
<br />
*crowd goes YUUUUS* There is something about Azeroth that is unique within the cosmology and thats why its in the focus of this.<br />
<br />
Do you have plans to resolve the Forsaken's strained place in the Horde?<br />
We realize that it is unresolved, we are going to explore the fissures in the Horde more in the future<br />
<br />
I love trolls. They are awesome. They are the best race ever created in WoW in my opinion. You gave us the new heroics and they were great and fun to play. But will we ever see a return of the troll empires? <br />
*Chris looks like he got the best idea ever just now* If the troll tribes could ever unite, look out world! We are going to continue the troll storyline in MoP. We will probably actuallize the Zandalari. They are not done yet and they are crazy. They are being driven by something just now. <br />
<br />
I like the serious parts of WoW, some comic elements are fun, but will MoP be all lighthearted or will we get some war and darker parts?<br />
You haven't even seen them or the expansion yet, we went back 15,000 years when creating them. We created a rich history and they aren't a joke race. There is a lot of story behind them, we think they are awesome fighers. They love life, play hard, work hard, fight hard, sleep hard. We aren't building an expansion based on an April Fool's joke. The Pandaren had some nice artwork for a long time, we have been thinking about them forever. They aren't a joke, they aren't silly, just a little bit lighter. They are relaxed, but this is part of the growing war between Horde and Alliance. The Pandaren are going to be part of this story.<br />
<br />
I read the shattering and the short story and Cairne Bloodhoof seems like he's walking the Sunwalker path.<br />
It can go a lot of ways. The sunwalker thing, everybody had a fit when it came out. It just did not feel all that right. Sunwalker was an attempt to atleast try and realise the lore and make sure it would fit as well as it could fit and the quest designers did a good job figuring that out. I dont think its appropriate for a tauren leader, I like the idea that Baine and Cairne are not supernatural people, they are just Tauren. Im not a huge fan of making them a sunwalker. I dont think we have solid plans yet of where Baine was going to go.<br />
<br />
Are we going to see more of the book's events in game ever?<br />
Some big things are coming in Patch 4.3, really big. It completes a very large story. It has been hard to develop the story for the books in real time with WoW, that is why we talked a lot about the past. Moving forward we want to try and do some story in the books that is current with the game. Not everyone wants to go and read books and comics, they want the content in the game. Players feel cheated when it is in a book and not in the game, which is why big current events happen in game rather than in books.<br />
<br />
The books provide more details, but we are going to try to get more of the books in game beyond just the big events.<br />
<br />
Ive played Alliance for 7 years *crowd woos* you have done a wonderful job with the Horde story, and its really great but when it comes to Varian he is a boring and 1 dimensional characters. Does Alliance ever get to kick ass in WoW?<br />
Heres the deal, part of the Thrall thing I have been pushing, I particularly love that character. I dont see that as a Horde issue but as a Thrall issue. Im biased. Heres what we are going to do: I dont know exactly where its going to drop, we are tyrying to get this for 5.0. Varian has the possibility to be a very awesome char. There will be a really awesome questline where Varian really shines out as a character. You will be his squire and will help Varian be an awesome character. And all the Alliance races WILL worship Varian as a true king. <br />
<br />
The Alliance is going to need a king that has his shit together. We are going to need this for MoP. We owe the alliance big time! We are also going to explore the various relationships with Andruin (his son), before Christie Golden wrote the shattering we had no plans for Anduin. Its all thanks to Christie that Anduin has been such an important character.<br />
<br />
We got some plans for that boy one day, so there you have it.<br />
<br />
Are there any rules to the Val'kyr Resurrection of Sylvanas?<br />
She had nine, used five so far, so there are only four left. <br />
<br />
I brought my archive to sign for you. I have 10 Horde 85s on 1 server. One of each class. I have always had a soft spot for Tirion to kind of justify why I loved him so much. Now for my question, Neptulon in the Throne of Tides. What happened to him? Are we going to find out about his relationship to Ozumat?<br />
Maybe we ill just leave that buried under the ocean. I have no good answer for that. What happens in the Throne of Tides stays in the Throne of Tides.<br />
<br />
The new Lich King was awesome before, but once he became Lich King he hasn't done anything about the Scourge. Why not?<br />
The Scourge and cult of the damned are independent of one another. The timeline is messy, if we could do it like a book the Scourge would have toned it down and things aren't as bad as they used to be. Clearly the quests are still in the game, it isn't something we can go back and fix right now. Someone picked up those Frostmourne fragments.<br />
<br />
In the Gundrak dungeon there is an area with the stone sentinel guys, and if you look over the rig you see a huge snake tail. There is nothing that massive and snakey in .. its a Chris Metzen answer to just go well look into it so I brought a screenshot of it for Chris.<br />
*Chris looks at snake tail* <br />
Dude just showed you his snake, man. -Dave<br />
<br />
That is not the thing that is driving the trolls. Its a super secret WoW storyline. Thrall is going to leave Aggra and start dating Jaina.. in all seriousness I have no idea what it is but its really awesome! Sometimes really awesome stuff shows up ingame and we scramble to explain what it is. Welcome to developing video games. We put the WHAT in WHAT.<br />
<br />
How will the panda leadership work since they belong to both factions? Can the leader be voiced by Jack Black?<br />
They don't really have leaders like the other factions. There are important pandas, representatives to each faction sure, but no single leader. No Jack Black voices, it isn't a panda movie. We were going to give Alliance pandas in Burning Crusade, but it didn't really fit. We have been serious about doing it for a long time, and it is a good thing we didn't do it then. We can do it much cooler and in a more interesting way now.</div></div><hr />

lets be honest though. Illidian in the burning legion xpac getting revenge on Kiljaedan and sargeras? Coming back to kill again sucks, but coming back to train lets say demon hunters or to help us out is amazing.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like a pretty good way to justify a return, actually, seeing as he was the first and most powerful of the Demon hunters. Hell, give him a mild dislike for everyone he meets at the time will reinforce the idea that he's only working with us to get back at the Legion, instead of some sudden, ressurection-induced loyalty to Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt he was being serious, the Crown was Lost, and unless they are going to bring Calia Menethil in for some lore time, the crown should REMAIN lost. It would hardly make any sense in making something like a head slot item a legendary, even if it would look badass it just doesnt fit lore unless some contention in Lordaeron happens...<br />

What is he up to? Are there more of his kind to see what he is up to?<br />
We don't know, it wasn't addressed in the story or lore. We might see someone reforging it in the future. Good question.. hmm.. the whole titan storyline.. who those folks are, what they are doing in the universe. Are they still alive? Do they have a plan if the world goes south? The titan storyline throughout WoW is something that needs to play out during a long time. Its not like we will have titans in two expansions. They are from somewhere really exotic. Not sure how to leveraget them into the timeline again, I loved what we did with in WotLK and Cataclysm. Ill riff a little bit and tell you that there are things about TBC that I really really loved. Shattered planets in the sky and etherals running around.. but as we talked to the community people wanted to kill kobolds and stuff thats what fantasy means to them...<br />
<br />
There is a part of me that just wants to launch into the universe. Are the titans still moving out there? Is the Burning Legion still out there? I want to go to Argus. How badass would it be if there was a shiny fleet of Draenei out there... oh technically thats Protoss. Its just a matter of feeling it out. We have a lot of time with this game. Let me just ask you all.. Is anyone here into the cosmic stuff?<br />

*crowd goes YUUUUS* There is something about Azeroth that is unique within the cosmology and thats why its in the focus of this.<br />

Varian has the possibility to be a very awesome char. There will be a really awesome questline where Varian really shines out as a character. You will be his squire and will help Varian be an awesome character. And all the Alliance races WILL worship Varian as a true king. The Alliance is going to need a king that has his shit together. We are going to need this for MoP. We owe the alliance big time! We are also going to explore the various relationships with Andruin (his son), before Christie Golden wrote the shattering we had no plans for Anduin. Its all thanks to Christie that Anduin has been such an important character. We got some plans for that boy one day, so there you have it.&quot; Sounds interesting.

If that is what hapepned to Neptulon, hooray. I hope the Naga enslave him and drain every drop of his substance out and flush the rest of him down a toilet. They're one race that deserves its dominance. As opposed to those which WILL worship Varian. Haha. Can't laugh enough at Metzen.<br />

How about him having lost his memory <br />

<br />
That'll work out!<br />
<br />
Hmmmm, who else to resurrect?<br />

<br />
Onyxia and Nefarion were legitimate because they were made undead as 'punishment' for failing their father. Kel'thuzad was undead anyway, there was no way he wouldn't come back in a Scourge expansion. Ragnaros wasn't beaten in his home realm (and was only half summoned in the first place, like Kil'Jaeden).<br />
<br />
Illidan, though...Illidan seemed dead. Unless it's another Muradin scenario where he was just comatose until we left then got taken care of by someone else, I'm not sure how he'll return.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, he became a demon more than I thought. Demons are like elementals, they don't die, they are sent to the Nether. Possible that Illidan's essence was sent to the Nether and he's been fighting the Legion there ever since.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you bothered to watch it you would know that Metzen admitted that Panderans were going to be the Alliance race for BC, and they did a lot of work on it then. They pulled back for some reason (probably the fact that the Chinese were upset that Pandas were wielding katanas and dressed like samurai) and went with space goats. <br />
<br />
So how exactly is it a joke race again? Oh, its not. Its just that it violates your QQ reasons so you ignore it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Possible, but I didn't think that was a particular power of the Well. Nozdormu's blessing granted the elves immortality, and immortality in Warcraft means 'non-aging but can still die from wounds'. Ancients, dragons and most Titan constructs are immortal, but can be killed. The only confirmed 'cannot be killed' cases in WoW are the Old Gods and Elune.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For the Pandaren not being a joke race, I don't think people are interpreting it right. Metzen knows it was originally a joke race, but it isn't any more. Lore has been written, they've been embraced into the Warcraft universe, and they were planning to do it for a while. It started as a joke race, but it's become a serious race, whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't making a race based on an April Fools joke&quot; would mean there have been big changes made to the Pandaren from their 'original' version way back in Warcraft 3. They are derived from a joke, but they have been constructed as a new race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those that didn't see it live, this was possibly the most important question asked during the panel because he called them on the carpet for this expansion's theme so it should be pointed out. <br />
<br />
This question was prefaced along the lines of a long-time veteran and Blizzcon-er and was the question that I'm guessing 90% of people who are against the whole panda thing are asking. Shame this isn't phrased in how it was asked because it was probably the most important and ballsy question asked of the panel and those that didn't see Blizzcon should have seen this. <br />
<br />
Here's how it was set up so people know how this was asked because it was actually very important. &quot;I've been to every Blizzcon except one, and I remember reacting to the announcements of the various expansions 'wooh we're going to Outlands, wooh we're killing Arthas, wooh we're killing Deathwing, Pandas, huh?&quot;. I like the serious aspects of Warcraft's storyline,&quot;... &quot;or is this going to be 18 months of kung-fu panda jokes?&quot; <br />
<br />
The guy was partly interrupted when he was setting it up, with Metzen asking &quot;Is this going to hurt?&quot; several times. You could tell that Blizzard is possibly on the fence about this decision they've made and how their vets are going to react and that they know it's going to be a tough sell. <br />
<br />
I honestly can say this was the same feeling I had going into the question, more of the &quot;you did WHAT to my game!?&quot; feeling of this fella. The answer they gave was actually pretty defensive in the tone they answered him in. But in the end, you know what? I actually came away from this answer thinking, &quot;maybe I'm missing something&quot;. I think naysaying should probably wait to see what they actually do. I have a sinking feeling that they know this is a bit lighthearted on the surface, so hopefully the underlying story is everything Warcraft. They just have an uphill battle selling it because everyone is going to see pandas first, and the storyline last.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've had 24 hours to absorb a bunch of new information about the game, hardly any of which addresses what will be happening in the game after MoP launches. As for being lighthearted, I guess we'll see. I don't disagree with you that people will see pandas first and draw conclusions but what I've heard sounds anything but lighthearted: Alliance-Horde war ramping up; Pandaren caught in the middle of it and joining both factions; that's basically a civil war among Pandaren to benefit Alliance-Horde ends. I'm sure there will be goofy stuff; there's always goofy stuff. But those that are loudly proclaming the Kung-Fu/Pokemon/Hello Kitty expansion are missing the point.<br />

I personally think it's hilariously hypocritical that you wish to have an adult conversation now, while earlier the only argument you brought to the table is that every person that might enjoy this expansion must be mentally 5 years old. Check yourself, dude, you might need it<br />
<br />
As for your &quot;mature conversation&quot;, let's see if you can keep up since you've clearly missed the entire point of this expansion story-wise to begin with. The focus, as you dramatically pointed out, isn't on some big bad creature wanting to destroy and/or take over the world. Does that mean MoP isn't for adults or lacks in mature themes? Not by far... The story team has stressed several time that the expansion will bring the Alliance/Horde conflict to the foreground. So, major theme? Uhm... war. Not only that, but for the sake of this war both the Alliance and Horde encroach on Pandaren land and screw up everything they find. The major themes in this expansion are war and the innocents caught up in the middle of that war. The focus is also going to be on the strain on diplomatic relationships in the Horde. cracks have begun to appear with Cataclysm, and those cracks are apparently only going to get bigger. Meanwhile the Alliance is going to be truly united for the first time in Warcraft history. Varian is getting an epic quest line that will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt he is a true leader and the Alliance will follow him to death apparently.<br />
<br />
So, I have no idea what your idea of &quot;mature content&quot; is, but if you're honestly convinced that mature content only involves death, decay, demons, and zombies all the people before me have made a valid point. Your mental capacity is that of a teenager, and a very immature one at that. Personally, personal conflict, war, the consequences of said war, and the political dynamics within and alliance or faction of people are very adult themes to me. To my belief, this expansion is actually the most thought invoking and adult content they have released, story-wise. We see conflict, we see problem-resolution, we see the consequences of our actions, probably for the first time. Please get over your sad understanding of the word &quot;adult&quot; or go leave for SWTOR quietly Do us ALL a favor.</div></div><hr />

Hell if I care. But it's fine to have a different opinion that mine, but you're basically doing the exact same thing that I did in calling you stupid, when you described people who liked the pandas. I really don't see the problem with Pandaren. They aren't freaking Carebears. They are a tough version of a panda, and a very well done model. Why not also look at the other things added as well, instead of just getting stuck on the fact you can play a panda.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did not call them stupid by any means. One person responded to me calling into question my maturity. I simply responded that the biggest fans of pandas are 5 year olds like my kids. Kids do in fact love pandas. I also brought up Chris Metzen's lore writing and how it has gone downhill lately. Now in my opinion Pandas don't really fit in with the next step in the lore if they wanted pandas in the lore well they shouldn't have passed them over in BC and put in worgens instead. Its simply a bad fit especially when they still have other options lorewise to use with something as important as an expac to make up for the short cominings in Cata. As for the other features I think the pet minigame of pokemon is just a bad idea and not really appealing to me. The talent rework was needed, but I think they overdid it but would have to test it out myself to make final decision on that. As for bringing in the monk class they passed on that in the past as well because they said it was not a good fit for WOW...and now they are changing their minds apparently. It just doesn't fit and a lot of these changes in my opinion don't fit well with WOW in general. Blizz had a good formula that worked for many years, but unfortunately they can't seem to find that balance that works for WOW. It has been around for a long time now so its harder to do something that is fresh and new without it being so fresh and new that it doesnt fit in with the game and what people fell in love with. Its a bit of a pickle. I do however stand by my opinion that they missed the mark bigtime with this expac. It really has left a bad taste in my mouth and made me decide to discontinue my subscription and move on to another game. Have a pleasant evening.</div></div><hr />

I'm noticing a pattern here. It seems anyone with an opinion that Pandaren is a bad idea is being ostricsized and labeled as 'butt hurt' or 'stupid' or a 'fan boi' of another game. It made me remember another reason why I don't enjoy WOW as much as I used to...the community has gone way down hill. People used to actually discuss expacs with an open mind instead of insulting others. Thank you for showing me why I won't be playing WOW anymore.</div></div><hr />

Man you just have to reply to everyone don't you? By how fast you replied and how many people you have replied to I can see you have had a productive day staying home on you're computer raging about a game apparently you don't even plan to play. It's okay though take a deep breath.... just eat another box of Entenmann's Donuts and jerk off to the SWTOR trailer it will be okay I promise.

Blizzard used to know exactly where the storyline was going years before they hatched it in the game during Vanilla and TBC and they seemed to have a gist of what they wanted to do in Wrath.

I still thought that maybe, just maybe, the Pandaren could work as a lighthearted joke race, lovable comic reliefs. But when they try so hard to convince us that they're totally serious and for real... well, that's just sad. Still no real examples of what the expansion's main theme alliance vs. horde is going to be like. How will this translate into the raid content? Ok, first raid tier is some dumb insect creatures and other indigenous Panderia beings, but what after that? Do alliance maybe get Garrosh or Sylvanas as raid boss or something, and horde can hill Wrynn or Greymane? Also... the dangerous Mantid who live imprisoned behind a giant wall, and are now starting to break out. Doesn't that sound a bit familiar? Like... silithid and the Scarab Wall? Uh, Blizzard? You're... copying yourself? How original. Talentless hacks.</div></div><hr />

On the other side, the moment that these panda's enter the game, me and 90 of my guildies are leaving. We thought that blizzard was aiming this more for a mature audience, but evidently they're shooting more towards promoting alcohol and violence towards 12 year olds. From their current angle with this game, and changes as they are coming, we are all blacklisting every blizzard game from now on also. You want to go that direction activision / bliz, enjoy your subscription drop. I see every person that took this game serious, every one that was a hard core raider, progression guild, etc, disbanding and looking for a game that will actually want to be taken serious.</div></div><hr />

j/k let's add pandas to the game.<br />
WoW is the only mmo i'm playing and I'm not going to be picking anything up when I'm quitting it. It's a shame really because I absolutely love wow but this xpac has no content, it's just a sidetrack to add more dailies and huggable characters for the chinese demographic. When they're back to being serious and advance the lore in relevant directions, maybe I'll be back. <br />
The Pandaren are going to be part of this story. This is just sad. Gotta love how the official movie on youtube has 50%+ dislikes.</div></div><hr />

They would probably be drinking beer right after. All the sort of anger, hatred and other negative energies become the Sha. It literally can come and bite you in the butt. They dont want to bring all that bad bagage into a fight. When a Pandaren fights he fights to reach a conclusion. When things are settled you take a beer.but surely in a bg they kill other pandarian of the other faction - thats hardly whats up, lets have a beer bro :/</div></div><hr />

Good god man. You sound like my dad. Always talking shit about good things. I don't think you are seeing what this new x-pac can bring to the Alliance and Horde. Since Wrath, in my eyes at least, the game really hasn't been about fighting each other... It's been about putting that aside and killing a common bad guy.

I really hope so, otherwise it would be a weak move: &quot;nah , we don't had time for this, lets completly forget about what happened there&quot;<br />
<br />
Also I don't know if they ever can make varian be adored by alliance players like the horde leaders... see what we got &quot;Douchebag King, Diamond Dwarf with bitchy daughter, Gnome King who can't get back in his kingdom because of level 30 Mobs, Velen and Tyrande twiddeling their thumbs for some years now... man i really wish we had lothar or Tirion as leaders, for now they killed the only cool guy with Bolvar the alliance had.

Love all the people saying SWTOR will be waiting for them. Good luck with that, it's an exact clone of WoW but set in space and had voice acting, like Blizzard Bioware has gone down greatly, just look at Dragon Age 2. Not to mention the game is so close to release and yet it is still riddled with bugs, i've lost count of the number of times the beta crashed for me, or the amount of times i got stuck in a rock or a tree.</div></div><hr />

In the Gundrak dungeon there is an area with the stone sentinel guys, and if you look over the rig you see a huge snake tail.

Its a super secret WoW storyline. Thrall is going to leave Aggra and start dating Jaina.. in all seriousness I have no idea what it is but its really awesome!

I don't think that trolls will be related to Old Gods in any way, well maybe you wouldn't have thinked that they will be related to Nerubian bugs as well, but i don't think so. Actually as i see we won't see any big character in raids or events in MoP, not in the first content. Maybe if in later contents they go back to the original storyline they will come up with N'Zoth or any kind of big bad guy, that lore fans waiting for. And then I will play again, (I'm sure i won't be playing 5.0 content but until the end of 4.3 now) if not I'll be waiting in hope for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

And you are talking like one of my children. I am simply expressing my opinion while you seem to be throwing a tantrum. I respect your opinion and I sincerely hope this expac lives up to your expectations so that you can enjoy it, but it is not my cup of tea. That isn't the WOW I loved to play for years this just reminds me more of a kids cartoon. Some of the features do sound interesting, but others just sound like they aren't a good fit for this game. Also I'm not a fan of them rehashing old content like they seem to have become accustomed to. SM and Scholo heroic modes? They couldn't just come up with new dungeons? Bringing illidan back in patch 4.3 war of the ancients? lame I killed illidan in BT...I took his warglaives...why is he back? Just doesn't make sense. It's like they are running out of original ideas and just reusing things that worked in the past and that just doesn't cut it for me. The only new stuff they are introducing in this expac just doesn't fit and its obvious by the amount of WOW fans who have been responding on the blizz forums and gaming forums in general. This announcement has effectively alienated and turned off anywhere from 30-50% of the fanbase based on what Ive seen out there. Hell most of the youtube videos out there right now with the announcement were getting about 50% dislikes on them before they were removed and reposted. I guess blizz figured it would be a good idea to get half of the playerbase interested in the other mmos coming out soon. Ill be sitting MoP out but Ill follow the news and info on WOW...maybe I'll come back the expac after this one, but it would take something spectacular to do that or the colossal failures of other games coming out.</div></div><hr />

There are new dungeons. As soon as they announced the revamped Heroic DM/SFK for Cata people much instantly started asking for SM at the very least. Of course responding to what players want is being lazy.<br />

You do realise War of the Ancients is an event from the *past* right? Much like how Thrall wasn't Warchief in the Escape from Durnholde instance? It's a major event in the pre-WoW Warcraft lore which Illidan was a big player in. As for the other comment about that in this thread<br />

Funny I didn't ask for it:P I saw their other dungeon announcements, but that isn't my problem my problem is that instead of making two entirely new dungeons they instead redid 2 existing ones. As for war of the ancients yes I do understand its caverns of time and its before you actually killed him...funny that he didnt recognize you when you bumped into him in BT though I guess he was blind, but I dont remember him losing his hearing...the changes are too different for WOW its like they took every idea from the new mmos coming out and tried to implement them all...it just ends up clashing with everything. Throw cute n cuddly panda bears in along with pokemon pet fights and its just like they overdid things. It also feels a bit rushed though i can see why they would hurry to get another expac out after having witnessed the epic failure of Cata. This blizzcon gets two thumbs down from me.</div></div><hr />
