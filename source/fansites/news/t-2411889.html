Battle Is Coming!<br />
Even as Azeroth’s wounds are tended, the shattered trust between the Alliance and Horde now proves hardest to mend. Amidst this age-old conflict, join your allies and champion your faction’s cause.<br />
<br />
New Events in Teldrassil and Lordaeron<br />
Beginning the week of July 24 and continuing for three weeks leading to the launch of Battle for Azeroth on August 14, experience the escalation of all-out war in Teldrassil, and later Lordaeron. A new chapter of the relentless conflict at the heart of the Warcraft saga is unfolding, and it’s time for you to take your place on the front lines!<br />
<br />
New Character Customizations<br />
The war with the Burning Legion has left orcs standing tall, a new posture option available to all orc player characters. Blood Elves now have access to golden eyes, as well as a few new faces.<br />
<br />
All of these new options are available at Barber Shops throughout Azeroth, and you can now alter your character’s skin color while you’re there.<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
The PvP Honor and Prestige system has been updated. Your PvP progress in Legion has been converted into account-wide Honor levels, which you’ll continue to earn through PvP.<br />
<br />
All class specializations’ PvP Talents have been revamped. Hit default hotkey ‘N’ to get a look at your PvP Talents, and default hotkey ‘H’ to see the new PvP system.<br />
<br />
War Mode is Here<br />
You can now enable War Mode and venture out into a world full of others who have made the same dangerous choice. Enabling War Mode provides additional bonuses:<br />
<br />
<br />
All PvP Talents you’ve chosen will be available to use anywhere PvP can occur.<br />
You’ll gain an additional bonus to experience while leveling up.<br />
Earn additional bonus gold and Resources from World Quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
War Mode can be toggled on or off beginning at level 20 by visiting either Orgrimmar or Stormwind and setting your preference in the Talent pane (default hotkey ‘N’). Beware! Once you venture out in War Mode, all zones will become contested, including zones such as Northshire Abbey.<br />
<br />
Sanctuary areas will still be PvP free.<br />
<br />
Additional War Mode features such as Bounty Hunter and Air Drops will become available in the new zones of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
July 17, 2018 marks the end of the final Legion season of ranked PvP, and the post-season period has begun. Look for all the new PvP progression and rewards to unlock and become earnable after the launch of Battle for Azeroth in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Strand of the Ancients and Ashran are no longer available.<br />
<br />
Social Features<br />
You can now create and join cross-realm social groups in World of Warcraft. Communities make it easier for you to find and play alongside adventurers who share common interests. Hit default hotkey ‘J’ to get started.<br />
<br />
Voice Chat is now available in all groups, Guilds, and Communities. Select the headset icon wherever you see it in game to talk with other players.<br />
<br />
Legacy Loot Mode<br />
Now, when you enter an instance at 10 levels or more above the maximum level of the content, Legacy Loot rules will be automatically enabled. Under Legacy Loot rules, drops will include a chance for all items that would drop for a full party or raid at the instance’s level.<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Sargeras’ cruel, final blow dramatically impacted both Azeroth and all of its denizens. The power of every Artifact weapon has now been depleted. Some powers from Artifacts have now been incorporated into their specializations. Your characters that are just getting started in Legion content will still seek out and acquire Artifacts.<br />
<br />
Statistics<br />
In an effort to make displayed numbers more perceptible, values used for player and enemy statistics have been reduced throughout the game. This includes values such as item-level, damage, armor, health, and defense measurements.<br />
<br />
A number of spells and talents now again activate a global cooldown when used.<br />
<br />
Blood Elves' Arcane Torrent now removes 1 beneficial effect from all nearby enemies and restores 3% of your mana (previously silenced nearby enemies and interrupted non-player characters).<br />
<br />
All talents have been refunded for all specs.<br />
<br />
All classes and specializations have been updated for Battle for Azeroth.<br />

<br />

Most likely its 3 weeks of burning the three and last week is Battle for Lordaeron. They could split burning the tree in parts because atleast in Horde side there is first Ashenvale and then the actual attack. When the attack starts there isn't really a good reason to split that one, but they could still do it.</div></div><hr />

so? not that much people play PTR and want to get the content and play it for the first time in live. People who play beta en PTR to report bugs even if blizz listens or not, are my heroes because i'm a selfish guy who wants to play it all live. One week it's ok to wait before the events start, my god it's only a week hahaha, if you did not do all the mage towers you wanted you had quite a lot of time since the start of argus (when you could get quite a lot of ilvl), I personally quit wow in february and came back to do the challenges that I could, won't blame blizz for not playing their game when I had to, damn xD<br />

Incorrect. They will merge honor levels to your highest one yet, say Prestige 4, they don't add up.</div></div><hr />

I've always said the same thing, but this is the first time, I'm like I gotta wait and see, because I am not hyped for anything in this expansion. It's not looking good for my subscription I know that.<br />

Ion said they won't be merging honor levels, he said they will merge the honor earned from all characters at 110, and combine them into the new Honor Level System, and make it account wide, so all 110s, are the same combined Honor Level, based on how much all that honor gets you.</div></div><hr />

They will merge honor levels to your highest one yet, say Prestige 4, they don't add up. Wrong, there is no prestige in beta, there are &quot;honor levels&quot;, if you copy multiple characters to beta you can see after logging them the honor levels increase, they don't cap at your highest character (log the highest one first, then alt, then see honor go up).</div></div><hr />

People who play beta en PTR to report bugs even if blizz listens or not, are my heroes because i'm a selfish guy who wants to play it all live. One week it's ok to wait before the events start, my god it's only a week hahaha, if you did not do all the mage towers you wanted you had quite a lot of time since the start of argus (when you could get quite a lot of ilvl), I personally quit wow in february and came back to do the challenges that I could, won't blame blizz for not playing their game when I had to, damn xD<br />
<br />
P.D: sorry for my english :p<br />

So, that's what PTR is for.</div></div><hr />
