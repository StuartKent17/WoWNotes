Ulduar is getting nerfed again. Even if players probably won't be happy with that I think it's a very good sign, Blizzard trying to get as many people as possible in Ulduar means they want to move to something new very soon ...<br />
06/11/09<br />
<br />
The Yogg-Saron encounter has received the following changes: Death Ray no longer hits players who are under the effect of Malady of the Mind, Guardians of Yogg-Saron no longer use Dominate Mind, the spawn rate of Guardians of Yogg-Saron is more forgiving, and these Guardians will no longer spawn if a player that is protected by Hodir’s Flash Freeze hits an Ominous Cloud.<br />
In the opening sequence of Ulduar you can now see Liquid Pyrite from farther away.<br />
The Flame Leviathan encounter has received the following changes: the bonus health Flame Leviathan receives per tower has been reduced, the ejection height from Flame Leviathan has been reduced, the snare effect of the Tower of Frost has been removed, and the cannons on Demolishers and Siege Enginers should now break Flash Frozen vehicles in 1 shot.<br />
The XT-002 Deconstructor encounter has received the following changes: the health of the heart has been slightly reduced in heroic difficulty and the rate at which Gravity Lapse and Searing Light are cast has been reduced.</div></div><hr />

funny thing is, instead of &quot;the bonus health Flame Leviathan receives per tower has been reduced&quot; they could've just fixed the bike-bug and it would give the same effect. Guess it's easier to nerf than fix.</div></div><hr />

Speaking as a member of a guild stuck on Yogg phase 2, the Yogg guardian changes will mean that instead of phase 2 starting with 3-5 guardians up, we will be doing it with ~0-2 as we won't get overrun due to our dps being lackluster and we won't be wasting time with tanks being mind controlled.<br />
<br />
The phrase that comes to mind describing the phase 1 nerfs is &quot;to the ground!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Normal is the second easiest instance in WoW history after just WotLK Naxx. Ulduar Hardmodes were the hardest instance in WoW history(if you ignore AQ bugged encounters), even after these nerfs it will still be the hardest in history. They catered the hard modes to the top 100 guilds when they could have easily just done it at sunwell level. ie every ulduar 25 hardmode is harder than the first 4 bosses in sunwell, even in their current nerfed states.<br />
<br />
Don't know why they couldn't just balance atleast some of the hardmodes at the twins, felmyst, brutallus level.</div></div><hr />

As of the drake topic:<br />

Why should they nerf the dungeon so my guild can get the drake, when we're obviously not good enough yet. What's up with a community who think it's a positive thing that everything is made so easy, that your efforts eventually mean nothing.<br />

It is a bit hard to coordinate and watch 25 people all at once. It's frustrating for the people who know what they are doing, and then maybe have 1 or 2 people messing up for some reason due to various factors. Sometimes it isn't the persons fault, so I think that it is stupid to have any fight where there is totally ZERO room for error, like it seems to be on the Yogg fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Pre-nerf' ? The way I see it, it's little more then the fixing of what annoyances phase 1 could give to your raid, given that the spawn rate of the Guardians did not require an alteration.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yay for Yogg nerf. *Someone here was saying that something like only 6% of guilds in the world have beat Yogg, that's a strong indication that something needs a nerf.<br />

<br />
Or at least 14% of the guilds should try harder. If my guild can kill it, then certainly yours can too.<br />
<br />

Yogg Easy Mode was somewhat challenging, but not that hard.<br />

And fun, mind you. This picture is a good summary of phase 3:<br />

<br />
Since when hard modes = content?<br />
<br />
Casuals whined about not being able to see the &quot;content&quot; which is why Blizzard made it piss easy and gave proper players hard modes. Are you telling me that hard-core players can't even have a challenge since casuals have claimed rights to HMs now as well now?<br />
<br />
Blizzard has dug their own grave with this pampering to casuals. Even if they just put vendors in capital cities selling gear for 1c casuals would still find a reason to whine about lack of content/armor gfx/OMGOPLOLOL classes in Arenalol/something.</div></div><hr />

Which means people whining for nerfs are so retarded they can't even faceroll the lolbosses. If they're so easy why are you crying for nerfs? The irony in that is delicious since you seem to be one of those people! Casual whiners at their best (worst) :D</div></div><hr />

People still seem to have forgotten the simplicity of all the Molten Core bosses, which were nothing more then a tank &amp; spank with, god forbid, a cleanse/decurse, move out of fire or, oh my on what people failed hardest, you are the bomb.<br />
<br />
Try Zul'Gurub, again most bosses were a simple tank and spank, the only 2 that required more then basic coordination was Tiger and Panther and perhaps Jindo and certainly Hakkar (but come on Hakkar is on par with XT-002, at max).<br />
<br />
Bosses like Thorim, Freya, Mimiron, to some extent Hodir are unseen in Classic easy raids and as such should not be counted in the same line.<br />
<br />
Black Wing Lair, yes was a huuuuuuuge step up from MC, personally i didnt see alot of it, but what i did see was far more enjoyable then the simple stuff.<br />
<br />
I'll grant you that perhaps Naxxramas was tuned a bit too easy, but if you bring enough fail, it will still be challenging. Ulduar is fine as it is, the nerfs are coming just in time for us in our guild, to not lose hope and keep progressing.<br />
<br />
Currently we're attempting to kill Freya 25man, and whats killing us, noobs not letting off Snaplasher and killing Snap-tank. The simple explaining of if you keep attacking it, it will grow too strong to tank == mindboggling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Multiabuse</div><div class="date">2009-06-12, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard modes are the most unpleasant aspect WoW has come up with to date. <br />
<br />
I'm not from a world-1st level guild by any means, but of the guilds on my server, we have been 1st or 2nd in all content since MC days. Our core group (which was trimmed with a lot of unpleasantries from 40 - 25) is now being shafted again. Our normal 2-3 tank, 5 - 7 healer setup is pretty much being pared down to 1 tank and 3 healers in order to meet dps requirements. Maybe 2 tanks, if we absolutely HAVE to. <br />
<br />
At this point, our entire raid has at least 4 pieces of t8 and most have some sort of normal mode weapon (many have 10 man hard mode weapons.) You would think we would be able to meet dps requirements consistently. <br />
<br />
The degree of difficulty between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; is excruciating. I am all for a challenge, but Mimiron/Freya (especially) are the most painful and un-fun ways I can think to spend 6 hours a night a week each on. And the worst part is admitting defeat and going to &quot;normal mode.&quot; It is insulting how stupidly easy content is. <br />
<br />
<br />
On normal mode, you have 14 variations of Void Reaver (minus the orbs). Hard mode you get 7 versions of M'uru and KJ simultanously. 2 months in and only 2 hard modes down in Ulduar (which is ahead of any other guild on our extremely high-population server). I enjoy the company of friends I have made over the past 4.5 years, but Ulduar in its current form is sapping any joy I get from raiding and turning into 6 hours of RNG putting a raid wiping poker in my teeth. I WELCOME the nerfs to hard modes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh so true!<br />
Not everyone has a full raiding week. Some guilds are limited to 2/3 raiding days a week. Some of us have kids and a full working week ;)<br />
So making earlier 'gateway' bosses easier and simpler like xt and flame means we can get into the heart of ulduar and get to the content that we want to work on faster allowing us to experience the place.<br />
At least these nerfs are thought out and are coming at a steady pace rather then the epic panic BT/Sunwell nerf<br />

Everything that saves time is appreciated. If WoW is all in your life, try ulduar naked.<br />

<br />
They aren't QQ about ULD Normal Modes. Casuals ppl still want to see content. Fact!<br />
<br />
But! No more Hard-mode Nerf! FGS! To quote the Blizz staff itself: Hard modes are designed for hard-core or med-core ppl. I think it means hard modes really doesn't need to nerf. Keep it challenging instead.<br />
<br />
And no, dont think I'm one from that top 18 guilds. Actually we just trying to kill Yoggi in normal mode, and didn't complete a single piece from the Ironbound meta yet.... But! I still state keep hardmodes HARD FGS! Otherwise hardcore and medcore players will quit wow and a new era, the World of Casualcraft will come.<br />
<br />
I dont care if Yogg Normal mode receives nerf to allow casual to enter his chamber, who cares? Who cares while there are hard modes to challenge. If you QQ about normal mode nerf, probably you feel yourself strong enough, then go do it in Hard Mode. U still have a challenge in WoW. But with Hard Mode nerf nobody has a challenege anymore....</div></div><hr />

There is no skill or hard work in downing a 25 man boss and taking two months to do it. Real skill and hard work is in the real world. Whose accomplished more, Ensidia or business man/woman who worked all his life for his money. I find it very sad the way people think that downing a boss after weeks of trying is hard work. HARD WORK? YOU ^&amp;^((££! You don’t know the meaning of the word!!! Your just pressing keys on a keyboard!!! Sitting down and most likely eating junk food, not showering for days because your glued to the Fcking screen slowly ruining you eyesight because you never take breaks. Screw you!<br />

/Rant. ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
A common misconception. As &lt;insert game&gt; is just a game, there is no skill in being good at it. Ergo, football is just a game and there is no skill on it. There is.<br />
<br />
There is skill in games and in MMOs they are usually quite varied. Not only spacial perception and reflexes but strangely as it seems more social skills in raid leading and Guild leading (try to manage a few dozens of loot whoring bastards higly comited players :P).</div></div><hr />

Hardcore players should see the nerfs as a sort of a deadline. If they want to be able to beat the bosses in the original difficulty levels, they have only so much time to do it. To moan about nerfs is a bit like saying 'we weren't good enough to beat the bosses before them, give us more time for us to &quot;prove&quot; we are good enough', which is quite silly. And to moan about nerfs when you have experienced the bosses before the nerfs feels as silly. What joy is there to be had from repeating the same experience over and over?</div></div><hr />

That's less than 1% of total guilds found on wowprogress database. Same goes for Three Light in the Darkness, Two Light in the Darkness and One Light in the Darkness. And as a sidenote, Alone in the Darkness is still uncompleted. <br />
<br />
How about XT-002 hard mode? Heartbreaker (H) 343 (0.64%). Again, less than 1%.<br />
<br />
I agree that Flame Leviathan encounter needed a bug fix but instead of that we received so called nerf fix so it would be easier to defeat it with all the bugs around. Fixing an encounter such us Flame Leviathan isn't easy because vehicle fights are rather new in World of Warcraft and therefor developers do not have that much experience from Vehicle fights compared to any other typical World of Warcraft PvE encounter. Easier solution is tuning down things they are having difficulties fixing. <br />
<br />
The Descent into Madness (H) 2916 (5.48%) - Only 5.48% of total guilds found on wowprogress database have managed to defeat Yogg-Saron in normal mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please stop complaining if Blizzard nerfs something you haven't completed. I have no problems if Blizzard nerfs everything I have already completed. It makes makes content easier to farm while waiting for next raid instance (No, I haven't completed GOTUR but we have no problems with those encounters that are getting &quot;nerfed&quot; (Talking about 10man version here.

No offence, but you reap what you sow. Every hardcore raider complained BITTERLY about Naxx, about Blizzard catering to casuals blah blah blah. Everyone postured about how they were hardcore and there was no content for them, how they'd got M'uru down pre-nerf and wanted bosses of that difficulty level again, how there was nothing wrong with raid-stacking and Blizzard were catering to casuals by removing the need for it etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
If you'd read these boards a month after WOTLK hit you'd have thought several thousand guilds downed KJ pre-nerf with the amount of epeening going on from so-called hardcore players. So surprise surprise, Blizzard went &quot;You want a challenge? Alright, we'll give you a challenge&quot;, and now these same hardcores are whining that Hard Modes are too hard and they have to stack DPS? (while at the same time whining even more when Hard Modes are nerfed) You wanted your M'uru-level challenge, and you got it. Don't bitch when it's too hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
casuals =/= noobs, casuals can and often are as good as hardcore raiders, but it has nothing to do with difficulity of the fight, this nerf is mostly for the medicore guilds, like mine tbh, who are for example overrun by adds in p1 becuase they lack dmg or coordination or 25 people, who know how to not stand in the fire, or in this case, clouds, yes, it will be easier, no, it wont be faceroll for them, noobs will still trigger clouds and wipe the raid. on the other hand, our 10man group is hoping for first Algalon pulls next reset, so for us, it wont change much, only abit easier two lights in the darkness and orbituary</div></div><hr />

Some of us take pride in clearing hard content, as it's the only existing character progression for us. Which is all a MMORPG is about, character progression.<br />
<br />
By making the bosses less challenging, it doesn't feel right. Only scrubs who only play for gear would think so. <br />
<br />
- Also you assume everybody have been progressing in Ulduar 7 days a week since day 1. A lot of guilds choose to farm content a bit before progressing on hard-modes, such as my own. Hence we first started hard-modes in 25man this reset.<br />

<br />
Our guild isn't uber-geared and possibly even a little bit behind on the curve with regards to dps and buffs (replenishment?). We even, rather often, need to scrounge up a 10th from our befriended guilds to fill up our raid.<br />
But with practice, determination and just plain common sense during fights (like 'Not Standing In Stuff') we managed to get through the entire Siege, almost all of the Antechamber and 60% of the Keepers. All that within not too many tries.<br />
<br />
Granted, it's normal mode on 10-man and I'm not expecting to ever get that special achievement before it's faded out of existance, but there's this kick to it when you manage to defeat a Boss that all Theorycraft says should be impossible for your current raid setup... until it's nerfed into an easier fight.<br />

Nice post, I love the stats. These stats are based on people who actually post on wowprogress, and you can safely assume that the people who post there are in a semi hardcore guild.<br />
So its also safe to assume the number of guilds who actually cleared the hardmodes are less than whats stated on wowprogess.<br />

I add a number to put this in perspective: Wowprogress has listed 53 000 guilds with 2.7 million characters.<br />
<br />
How high the actual number of raiders is, I cannot say. BTW, of these listed raidgroups only 50% have ever killed KT and thus cleared Naxx.<br />
<br />
Obviously most users here who are spewing their bile on how Naxx is now harder than Ulduar know shit and just need something to QQ in the morning. The game is more challenging to the majority of people than you care to admit. Luckily Blizzard doesn't wear your rose tinted glasses.</div></div><hr />

Someone said that casuals are someone who plays 5 hours a DAY or less.<br />
<br />
... I usually play more than that, actually I play way too much usually, more than any human should. But the thought that someone is casual if they play 5 hours a day seems a little high to me. I would think that someone who is casual only plays like 1 or 2 hours a day... if that, maybe every couple of days or so. Do people really think that you have to play this game 5+ hours every single day to not be considered casual? <br />

I thought that it was a little strange. Nothing was wrong with the comment that the person made, I just didn't know that some people had that opinion.</div></div><hr />

Do people really think that you have to play this game 5+ hours every single day to not be considered casual? <br />
<br />
<br />
People have attempted to define Casual vs Hardcore a million times- the meanings differ from person to person. I for one don't believe in a time-based designation. I probably play 20-30 hours a week most weeks but would consider myself solidly casual. To me, the differentiation is the extent to which your real life is restricted by the game. I raid twice a week. Those are the only times I'm obliged to be in WOW. Some weeks I won't log in at all other than those two raid days, some weeks I'll be online every day. <br />
<br />
For me though, if I was in a raid guild that obliged me to raid 5 times a week and required 90-100% attendance I would consider that ultra-hardcore. It would require that I sacrifice a large part of my RL, my social interactions outside WOW, in order to play the game. That's a sacrifice I'm not prepared to make, and why I therefore consider myself to be a casual player. That's not a judgement call of 'Hardcores are nolifers', it's just a statement that being hardcore to me requires a choice to dedicate much of your spare time to WOW, and to juggle your RL based on your WOW schedule rather than the other way round.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, overreact much? Robert Mugabe is an insult to humanity. Radko Mladic is an insult to humanity. Paris Hilton is an insult to humanity. Casuals? Get over it.<br />

<br />
Some of us take pride in clearing hard content, as it's the only existing character progression for us. Which is all a MMORPG is about, character progression.<br />
<br />
By making the bosses less challenging, it doesn't feel right. Only scrubs who only play for gear would think so. <br />
<br />
- Also you assume everybody have been progressing in Ulduar 7 days a week since day 1. A lot of guilds choose to farm content a bit before progressing on hard-modes, such as my own. Hence we first started hard-modes in 25man this reset.<br />
<br />
Why would we want it to be less challenging? We're raiders , wiping is our game! We PLAY FOR THE CHALLENGE, not for the loot!<br />
<br />
<br />
then you should have been faster...... not blizzards mistake</div></div><hr />

Someone said that casuals are someone who plays 5 hours a DAY or less.<br />
<br />
... I usually play more than that, actually I play way too much usually, more than any human should. But the thought that someone is casual if they play 5 hours a day seems a little high to me. I would think that someone who is casual only plays like 1 or 2 hours a day... if that, maybe every couple of days or so. Do people really think that you have to play this game 5+ hours every single day to not be considered casual? <br />
<br />
I thought that it was a little strange. Nothing was wrong with the comment that the person made, I just didn't know that some people had that opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
A casual is someone who doesn't EVER have to log on at 7:00. That's all. If they feel like having fun one weekend and log on, lose track of time, and realize they were playing for 5 hours, they're still casual. Until you need to plan your life around WoW (to some extent...even if it's 2 nights a week), I consider you casual.<br />
<br />
Therefor - anybody who raids is pretty hardcore as far as normal standards go. Sure there are people who are more hardcore than others, but............yeah, you see my point.</div></div><hr />

These stats are based on people who actually post on wowprogress, and you can safely assume that the people who post there are in a semi hardcore guild.<br />
So its also safe to assume the number of guilds who actually cleared the hardmodes are less than whats stated on wowprogess.<br />
<br />
The stats are pulled from the Armory automatically. They include every single kind of guild as long as that guild has one person that appears on the Armory - so if you have a bank guild with someone in there higher than level 10, they're gonna pop up on WoWProgress.<br />
<br />
The Yogg stats don't seem that low when you compare them to how many people have beaten the first group of bosses - The Siege of Ulduar - because at that point they jump up to almost 20% of people who are seriously doing Ulduar have completed it. You lose about half your raiding guilds at the Keepers, and then about half again at Vezax/Yogg.<br />
That's, in my opinion, a pretty acceptable descent (excuse the pun) in completion stats.</div></div><hr />

Probably what I tought a few weeks ago is right... they're now going for a new MMO wich will be like WoW was and use WoW as &quot;money maker&quot; that don't need much atention from developers (and for people who can't play a &quot;non-scrubfacerollinggimegimelootthatIpaid30daysfor&quot; new mmo).<br />
<br />
Really, stop and think... those nerfs are totally &quot;anti-casuals&quot;. Because if you're not fast enough to play the content as it should be (take or give a few necessary nerfs/bug fixes), you're obligated to play as a scrub with pro-scrub nerfs.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but part of the fun in a game that isn't labeled as &quot;casual games&quot; (like the ones from xbox live that you open and finish them in a few minutes because they're meant to be just like that) is its challenge. If there are people who prefer to press numlock and just watch their toon running and throwing flowers everywhere from FL to YS... well... i'm sorry but wow wasn't supposed to be that kind of game...</div></div><hr />

Yes, you're completely right, it's always a good idea as a commercial company to target your games towards a tiny hardcore proportion of elitist gamers, rather than produce games for the vast, 10 million strong majority of players who just want something fun and moderately challenging to pass some time in the evenings after work. I mean, that strategy has worked so well for all the other MMO makers who regularly compete with Blizzard's millions of subscriber figures and generate similar billions in revenue, right?<br />
<br />
Seriously, get a brain- any other MMO that Blizzard produces will be more like WOW is currently than anything else. Do you really think Blizzard are sitting there going &quot;Right, we have 100 million dollars to invest in a new franchise, let's make something that will appeal to the minuscule proportion of hardcore gamers who aren't happy with WOW Hard Mode bosses- we're bound to make a killing out of those 5,000 subscribers!&quot; Don't be an ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know, I would say that anyone who raids 20-30 hours per week is pretty hardcore. That's as much as some people work in a week nowadays. In a previous job, I usually worked between 25-40+ hours a week, depending on who called off and how business was.<br />
<br />
But yeah, everyone pays their $15 a month for the game, so I think that even people who aren't in hardcore guilds should be able to experience everything. I am in a raiding guild and luckily I am able to see things. But not everyone has the time, patience, social skills, or whatever else to be able to say the same thing. Does that mean that they shouldn't see everything in the game and be able to do it? Remember, it is just a game, this isn't like actual real work where you need to &quot;work hard&quot; to get ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And do you really think that WoW just had success because it's easy (now?). The old &quot;News flash&quot; for you. &quot;millions&quot; came to play this game way before &quot;WotLoLK&quot; not because you can faceroll a 25-man raid as you were soloing a &quot;G1&quot; quest. In fact, the servers had way more active players in TBC than in WotLK (and it's worse in PvE servers).<br />

Actually, I'm not sure if they nerfed it because of the QQ. I think that they perhaps looked at the stats and said &quot;Geeze, only 6% of guilds are actually killing Yogg on 25 man regular mode, maybe we made it too hard.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Not sure if you meant to quote me, as I didn't say anthing about &quot;each day&quot; - but what exactly &quot;is/was&quot; WoW?

That is exactly the reason why I don't a lot of the crying around in this thread. Comments like &quot;Ulduar is the second easiest instance in WoW up to now.&quot; just make me shake my head in disbelief and seriously doubt that any of the posters ever went to Molten Core or BWL where the main problem was to get the 39 other idiots to show up in time and have the mages generate enough water to supply them.<br />
<br />
I only raid 10 man's these days and my raid is currently practicing Mimiron, which means that we downed about 1 boss per week since the release of Ulduar without having done any hardmodes yet. And altough I am pretty content with the level of difficulty that Ulduar is currently offering my group up to now, I can see that beating all hard modes before the next content patch ships is going to be pretty hard on groups such as mine. So yeah, I'm kinda welcoming those little nerfs and for the life of me, I can't understand why so many people make such a big deal out of this.</div></div><hr />

A massively redundant argument. WoW has always been the easiest, least hardcore MMO out there. <br />
<br />
If you are concerned about your elite status as a hardcore gamer so much play a recognised hardcore game like Lineage 2. Otherwise, don't complain. There's eleven million subscribers to say YOUR brand of playing is less succesfull than theirs.<br />
<br />
What people who aren't you do in the game shouldn't be a concern to you. If you have already completed these encounters, kudos. Yogg is as difficult as Attumen the fifth time you kill him. If you haven't, then you have had plenty of time to get there and are months behind the curve.</div></div><hr />

As others have pointed out, the boss mechanics of everything up to AQ 40 was basically a joke....tank, spank, stay out of the fires. Where are the hard modes in that time?<br />
The game is constantly changing...like the world and the playerbase.<br />
<br />
<br />
exactly, even old Naxx was considered damn hard, yet since mechanics of the fights didnt change almost at all and are considered easy now, but not because mechanics of fights are &quot;easy&quot; (tbh alot of the fights are still more complex than anything in karazhan), its the mechanics of the classes, that are changed, there are no more blocks like &quot;4h with 4 full t3 tanks otherwise 8 tanks&quot;, everyone has alot more HP for certain abilities, healers dont have to do rotations to regen mana from spirit and frankly bosses in naxx just have very low HPs compared to their old counterparts and dps/hps/hpm in those times, not to mention basically nonexistant aoe heals in vanilla.<br />
<br />
its pretty different from those times, where were all those Pain Suppresions, Guardian Angels, pally dmg reductions, Earth shields, smart godknowshowmany yards aoe heals? i would love to see whiners, tellling people, that ulduar is easier than preLK bosses, doing ulduar with same spells as before, and if they beat it, THEN they are right and ulduar is easy vs older raids.</div></div><hr />

That's as much as some people work in a week nowadays. In a previous job, I usually worked between 25-40+ hours a week, depending on who called off and how business was.<br />
<br />
But yeah, everyone pays their $15 a month for the game, so I think that even people who aren't in hardcore guilds should be able to experience everything. I am in a raiding guild and luckily I am able to see things. But not everyone has the time, patience, social skills, or whatever else to be able to say the same thing. Does that mean that they shouldn't see everything in the game and be able to do it? Remember, it is just a game, this isn't like actual real work where you need to &quot;work hard&quot; to get ahead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aye, I bought a single player game - but im too stupid to complete it, but Ive paid exactly same ammount as others did, so I also want to finish it - so I use cheats.<br />
<br />
Same thinking is like this - I bought Basketball for 40 euro as others did, so why I still sucks at that game, while others can play in tournaments.<br />
<br />
There's something called TALENT - u can be good in some thing but suck at others. SO saying that you pay for something and u want to see exactly same what GOOD players see is ridicolous. Its smellin like comunism ideas - everything for everyone - no matter who you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason why old Naxx was more difficult was not because of the complexity of the fights, but because of the TUNING of them.<br />
It was never hard to dance at heigan when you have at least an IQ of 85, but back in the day it was FASTER and had zero tolerance at failures. Not just encounter mechanics make hard fights, but also how they forgive failures.</div></div><hr />

I DO understand what Blizzard wants and are doing. They want all the 7 year-olds playing hunters and DK's to see and kill Yogg. OK fine, nerf the rat shit out of 10mans. All progression raiding guilds DO NOT CARE about 10 mans, they are simply there to fuck around and, in a very few instances, can be used to learn new fights. For example, I have found it refreshing that Yogg was an unpredictable fight, where most of the encounter (never mind phase 3) required at least some brain activity and thinking on your feet. <br />
<br />
The ONLY thing blizzard has left is lore, this game is out of control. They took an instance which challenged ALL progression raiding guilds (forget the top10 or so, they are too cool for school) and have now made it so it can be cleared in 1 night. Exactly what Naxx is/was. <br />

Sad thing is that there ar a lot of end game BiS items in 10m hardmodes. And its also make me sad. To collect ur dream gear to got to basicly clear 4 different instances - 10m, 10m hardmodes, 25m and 25m hardmodes. U got to kill all da time same bosses, but in different raid size and with different mode. It got to be BORING after clearing it all like 2-3 times.</div></div><hr />

In the real world, you have to work for your accomplishments. That's how I want my game to be, too. It felt good when I graduated college. It felt good when I got my job offer. It felt good when I killed Nef for the first time. It didn't feel good, or even satisfying, when I killed KT 25 the first time.<br />
<br />
Now, before you look at my armory, I'm not in a world-first caliber guild, but I'm in a guild that will have our drakes before the next raid comes out. We don't do it for other people, or for the shiny gear we get to wear for being &quot;skilled.&quot; It's all about the accomplishment you feel when you work hard (and yes, it is working hard) and get something done. When everything is getting nerfed to the ground, you just don't get that feeling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR: it isn't about the gear. it isn't about laughing at &quot;noobs&quot; who can't kill a pre-nerf boss. it isn't about looking cool to casuals. it's about working to accomplish something, and feeling good when you finally do.</div></div><hr />

Here is a reality check for you: Yogg-Saron normal mode is not hard, AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE HARD. No need to be sorry about loosing your e-peen, when you never had one to begin with. Normal mode is something that should be cleared by most players by the time the next content patch is out, just like Naxx.<br />
<br />
Many hard mode encounters are tuned much harder then anything previously, including SWP. And most of you who thinks you are so good will never, ever defeat them in their current iteration even though you say you will.<br />
<br />
By the time the next content patch is out, it will still be a tiny minority of players that will have defeated Algalon and done all the hard modes and that's the whole point.<br />

It was perfectly doable... even shitty guilds reached yogg after 1 month+ now. WHy nerf it more. They see the last boss in ulduar, they have something to work for... or wait..i forgot casuals need gear fast as the hardcore players becouse they pay per month as well..my bad there u go.<br />
<br />
whateva... one of above posters said example of the situation with the basketball ball i agree completely. <br />
<br />
What.. i guess they whined 1-2 weeks that the encounter is hard cus they cant pass phase 1??? So.. nerfed phase 1.. lets see how long it will take that they nerf phase 2 also... like u enter portal u got 2 mins instead of 1 before u gone crazy.. and there wont be any npc/tantacles to kill so u just enter and dps brain??? <br />
and then maybe the phase 3... no more immortals spawns... just kill the damn frog????<br />
<br />
really all this is retarded.<br />
And after 1 year... &quot;We are happy to announce that we removed the guilds from the game. U can just use random chat channel to spend time chatting with your friends.We felt like this change was needed to make the game more simple and easy for playing.

blizzard wants everyone to clear ulduar (get geared) so as many as possible can go to the new raid dungeons in next patch, and icecrown citadel after that patch<br />

That's what they said about Naxx. When the next instance hits, they'll make it easy and say it's so people can be geared for Icecrown. Icecrown will be tuned for people wearing Ulduar gear, eventhough everybody will be in Colosseum gear.</div></div><hr />

Try having a look at the boards of people who've actually killed Hard Mode bosses, rather than the leet-kiddies who come on this board claiming that these nerfs are devastating because now everything will be too easy (despite the fact that most of those posters are a billion miles from getting those Hard Modes down). Ensidia have criticised some of the tuning of Ulduar Hard Modes, but they've also said that some are BETTER tuned than M'uru. If you've seen their kill movie of Mimiron HM and heard the nerdscreams at the end you'll understand that it's as challenging (if not more so) than anything in SWP. So hahahahaha...yes.</div></div><hr />

Naxx can albo be hard - just do some hard modes. For example try killin kel'thusad while every1 staying in 1 group - hell yea it must be challenging to chain 25 ppl in iceblocks.<br />

Wrong...? EU gates opened April 30th. SK killed M'uru on May 3rd. Not long, but certainly not 30 hours.<br />

And besides. Hard modes are not content. Once you kill a boss in normal mode, you've killed the boss. Killing him a minute quicker or fighting the boss and his dead wife is NOT content.</div></div><hr />

No, here's a reality check for you. He's a God. He apparently poses a mortal threat to an entire continent and perhaps to the whole of civilised life. To quote Blizzard, he is: a horror even the Titans could not, would not destroy, an evil they merely... contained. Beneath ancient Ulduar, the Old God of death lies, whispering.... Tread carefully, or its prison will become your tomb. He *is* meant to be hard.</div></div><hr />

I thought you said Ulduar was easier then SWP? Now is it or is it not? If it's currently impossible, then it is not easier now isn't it? Mu'ru was about that close to be impossible as well, and it could only be a matter of farming a bit more hardmode gear to make something impossible into something near-impossible.<br />
<br />
But yea, hard modes is not really new content I agree. But as some people are pointing out the &quot;single player game with difficulty level&quot;, that's about the same thing. You got a slider and it's up to you to decide how you do it.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Also, yes, when you kill a boss on normal mode you have killed them on NORMAL MODE. Hard mode content is the new progression, make no mistake, and the hard modes are a lot more than killing bosses a minute quicker and fighting their wife (lol?).<br />
<br />
As someone who experienced the Sunwell content, Freya is the hardest hard mode I've done so far and I would put it on par with a Sunwell fight for sure. Just because you watch videos of the perfect attempt that people did on a boss doesn't mean they didn't wipe LITERALLY hundreds of times before getting the kill.<br />
<br />
Besides, even your beloved Ensidia has publicly stated that Heroic: Firefighter is on par or even harder than M'uru pre-nerf.<br />
<br />
These nerfs seem small to the untrained eye, but the Yogg Saron nerf for example makes Heroic: One Light in the Darkness much easier, makes getting cleanly into phase 2 remarkably easier (which some say is the key to the fight other than freezing the brain quickly in Phase 2).<br />
<br />
Also, the XT-002 hard mode nerf is going to be the difference between mediocre guilds hitting the enrage timer and killing it (because the fight was decently tuned before).<br />
<br />
However, i really don't mind the Flame Leviathan nerf (even though i still think it's quite easy once you've learned it), such a buggy encounter (pyrite being unable to be grabbed by demos, vehicle abilities not doing damage). You could literally sit there wiping for hours for no reason if you get some stuff bugged or get rng'd.<br />
<br />
All this being said, these nerfs are to be expected, and they won't be the last. Blizzard always nerfs content, because they want to put loot in your pockets and make the impossible seem possible so you run out of things to do and get excited for the new content. Firefighter is probably the next encounter to get the nerf bat, but I'm hoping my guild can get it before that happens =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There's a difference between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;impossible&quot;. If I proposed a contest where I held you under water for 3 hours with no air tank, you would decline. Not because it would be &quot;hard&quot; for you to survive, but because it would be &quot;impossible.&quot; See? They're different things.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, yes, when you kill a boss on normal mode you have killed them on NORMAL MODE. Hard mode content is the new progression, make no mistake, and the hard modes are a lot more than killing bosses a minute quicker and fighting their wife (lol?).<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, I completely agree with this. I didn't say it wasn't the new progression, I said it's not new content. Killing a boss for the first time on hard mode isn't as exciting as killing a hard boss for the first time. Sure, it's still great to get the kill, but it's not as rewarding. Especially when you get the same loot plus 1 item. It just doesn't feel that different.<br />
<br />
Blizzard even agrees with this. You'll see this from the sentiment that Blizzard wants everybody to see all the content, and then hardcore guilds can do the hardmodes. Even they don't consider it content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides, even your beloved Ensidia has publicly stated that Heroic: Firefighter is on par or even harder than M'uru pre-nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that it matters, but I couldn't care less about Ensidia. I only used them as an example because everybody knows who they are, and they are clearly the best. Blah blah blah, rage about another guild, I don't care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From http://www.wowprogress.com/ here's A list of the number of guilds that have completed each hard mode, and the percentage of guilds that have done them. This is all accurate data taken straight from the armory.<br />
<br />
I Could Say That This Cache Was Rare (Hodir): 1080 (2.03%)<br />
Lose Your Illusion (Thorim): 682 (1.28%)<br />
I Choose You, Steelbreaker (Iron Council): 392 (0.74%)<br />
Orbit-uary (Flame Leviathan): 370 (0.69%)<br />
Heartbreaker (XT): 263 (0.49%)<br />

One Light in the Darkness (Yogg): 32 (0.06%)<br />
Firefighter (Mimiron): 19 (0.04%)<br />
<br />
This was as of 6/10/09 before the nerfs. Obviously, that's a low number of guilds.</div></div><hr />

Awwww. Poor elite players. How will anyone know how big your epeen is if things keep getting nerfed?<br />

Whatever. If it 'wasn't that hard' to begin with, then it still wont be hard for you. Net difference for you: Nothing. Cry moar.<br />

Maybe they are making it easier so people can get gear faster. making people geared for the next patch. Meaning *hopefully* it will be something big.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2009-06-12, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disagree, my idea of &quot;new content&quot; is the abilities of the boss/encounter, not what the flowers and walls look like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong:<br />
<br />
First: Bosses have new abilities or crutches (4 keepers on yogg) are taken away from you. Because..let us face it: You needed those 4 crutches to kill Yogg first time round.<br />
<br />
Second: Difficulty levels have been in games since day 1. Easy, normal, hard, nightmare etc. It was a domain of single player games. There is no rule it cannot apply to mmos.<br />
<br />
Third: Does Blizzard really claim Hardmodes are &quot;new content&quot; and if so please link the quote. It cannot be new content - it was there from day one but EVERYBODY (except maybe InnerSanctum) chose to try the game at first on easy mode. So stop whining you wussies.<br />
<br />
Fourth. Unless you quit raiding the day you killed Yogg, you go back the next week - KILLING THE SAME BOSSES AGAIN. But..oooops...that is what you felt was such a fail about hardmodes. But no...you are even worse: You kill the same bosses again, but this time your raid wears 20 shiny new epics...and the week after 40 shiny new epics..soon 100 shiny new epic. And you still go in and KILL THE SAME BOSSES AGAIN! You progressed from easy mode to retard mode by your own choice it seems...week after week, but no way you are ever going to try a hard mode, because that only has &quot;different flowers on the wall&quot; (and the boss' dead wife as some other poster put it).<br />
<br />
Do us a favor and stop whining ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
now we can move from facerolling to afk-facerolling<br />
<br />
<br />
Please link your Yogg kill. Then your Heartbreaker achievement. If your Yogg kill has not been achieved within the first week of the 3.1 release, you have no right to claim you are facerolling anything ^^</div></div><hr />

I don't see how a hard mode boss, which essentially becomes an entirely new and challenging encounter when doing it on hard mode, doesn't qualify as new content. Each hard mode encounter has numerous new elements and challenges added to it. And i certainly felt excited when my guild was able to down 3 add freya the other day. <br />
<br />
On the topic of loot, most hardcore guilds have the ability to kill any piece of hard mode content in this game currently with the loot on their backs, so who really even cares about loot. And the boss may only drop 1 new piece of loot, but if you put that content on farm and get those greate 239 ilvl items you do nothing but set your guild up for success beyond Ulduar. I'm sure that pretty soon we'll see hard mode bosses dropping multiple ilvl 239 items as well.</div></div><hr />

Dominate mind was just annoying, as was spawning adds if you were frozen.

<br />
RNG = not fun.<br />
<br />
If you want to really nerdrage, argue for the tuning to be hard, not for the mechanics to be capricious.<br />
<br />
Giving tentacles +50% hp would be a good way to make it hard.<br />
<br />
Giving random MCs that can wipe the raid is not a good way to make it hard.<br />
(and if you haven't done Yogg phase 1 pre-nerf...spawning 2-3 extras usually means a wipe for 90% of guilds)<br />
<br />
<br />
Difficulty should be about execution... not luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, on the ice cream truck metaphor...<br />
You wouldn't be happier if the ice cream truck stopped for you at first, then a few weeks later started making you chase it for several blocks.<br />
<br />
It's pretty much impossible to tune the difficulty correctly at the start. Blizzard opts for Hard &gt; Easy, which works MUCH better than Easy &gt; Hard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shox</div><div class="date">2009-06-12, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People don't seem to get what it is that companies do: Blizzard's main objective is, like almost every other company, to make money! How do you think they'll do that? By making everything as hard as possible so only a small percentage of the players will enjoy it?<br />
<br />
They nerf these encounters not because they think it's too hard, but because they want the right percentage of players to enjoy these encounters. If it's too easy, too many players will get bored too soon/don't feel like they've achieved anything, and those players will leave. If it's too hard, too many won't get to see those encounters/will get bored of naxx and those will also leave.<br />
<br />
Blizzard probably reviews the number of players who have completed ulduar constantly and nerf encounters to get the right balance between players who get to see ulduar and those who can not.<br />
<br />
I don't like these nerfs either, I too think that they're unnecessary. But people have to know that they don't make this game only to please the &quot;hard core&quot; players, they want to please as many players as possible.</div></div><hr />

Right, cause god forbid healers dispel with timing and skill, clouds are hard when healers blindly dispel people in clouds. Nothing about phase 1 Yogg needed to change. <br />

Well done you. Now look at that term again: 'hard modes'. There's a clue in that name. They're meant to be hard. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Pretty sure boomkins can glyph to remove the knockback, and sorting out macros in advance is kind of part of preparing for a fight. <br />
<br />
I admit that my guild hasn't downed Yogg yet, and have barely got into ph.2 on 25 man. But we're fairly casual - 4 raid nights a week - and it's less than 2 months into the expansion, and to be honest, my reaction to seeing people walking into clouds on p.1 wasn't 'omg, this needs to be nerfed now', it was 'omg, we need to get better at this.'</div></div><hr />

Like I said.. I'm not trying to troll but simply offering an alternate option to what people can do. I'm just saying.. On the WoW box, it even says your playing in an &quot;ever changing&quot; world people need to be able to adjust to the decisions blizzard makes and if they haven't understood yet that in WotLK Blizz is trying to get as many people into raids as they can then they need to take sometime and rethink things before they come on here and cry. <br />
<br />
Oh, and yes I DO understand why people are complaining.. I don't understand the nerfs either and I don't like them but being a mature person I try not to complain about these things anymore. It does seem odd though.. I don't think nerfing Ulduar will get more people into it either.. They should atleast wait a little longer because..as we all know Casual/Mediocre (not the same thing) guilds don't progress as fast as Hardcore guilds. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flamingcloud</div><div class="date">2009-06-12, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is exactly the reason why I don't a lot of the crying around in this thread. Comments like &quot;Ulduar is the second easiest instance in WoW up to now.&quot; just make me shake my head in disbelief and seriously doubt that any of the posters ever went to Molten Core or BWL where the main problem was to get the 39 other idiots to show up in time and have the mages generate enough water to supply them.<br />
<br />
I only raid 10 man's these days and my raid is currently practicing Mimiron, which means that we downed about 1 boss per week since the release of Ulduar without having done any hardmodes yet. And altough I am pretty content with the level of difficulty that Ulduar is currently offering my group up to now, I can see that beating all hard modes before the next content patch ships is going to be pretty hard on groups such as mine. So yeah, I'm kinda welcoming those little nerfs and for the life of me, I can't understand why so many people make such a big deal out of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I made the original comment and I stand by it. I have done every instance in the game when it was new. Molten Core and BWL both took far longer to get cleared than Ulduar for starters. Just because the encounters were simplistic doesn't mean they weren't hard.<br />
<br />
If you had done every instance just when it came out you would know why it is the second easiest instance of all time. MC is obviously the 3rd easiest, everything in BC(i'm not counting instances that didn't have 25/40 man versions) was far harder than Ulduar. MC pre-diremaul, pre-AV/WSG/honorgear, was quite hard compared to post first-week bug fixes/nerfs Ulduar, especially Ragnaros. My guild was in the top 25 for Rag, top 5 for BWL/AQ, I have a pretty good handle on how things were.<br />
<br />
And like I said Ulduar hard mode is the hardest instance of all time. Every single hardmode has been killed by less guilds than kalecgos, and far far less than illidan, the majority of them by less guilds than m'uru(talking pre 3.0). The biggest problem is probably the large disparity between the dps of the best guilds and the second tier of guilds. Perhaps they made dpsing too hard.<br />
<br />
Anyways the problem is no middle ground. There should have been encounters(be they regular or hardmode) in the large large large gap between normal and hardmodes. It is like an instance full of akama/supremus with m'uru hardmodes and nothing in the kalecgos, felmyst, illidian, archimonde difficulty level. Hell nothing is even in the gorefiend, souls, lurker, leotharas level.</div></div><hr />

Man, no wonder you think WoW is too easy. Your healers can stop time and predict the future. That's pretty mad timing and skill.<br />

Of course it wasn't impossible. You know what else wouldn't be impossible? An encounter that made the raid gather in a perfect circle and do the hokey pokey every 26 seconds on the nose. It sure would be annoying and stupid, though...</div></div><hr />

No, just kidding. Seriously though, I think that a few people have said something about how it is a little crazy to compare an online game to a real life situation. I totally agree with them. I guess if they want something that takes real skill and will actually bring you a bit of personal accomplishment, then maybe they should seek out something in real life to get it.

Man, no wonder you think WoW is too easy. Your healers can stop time and predict the future. That's pretty mad timing and skill.<br />
<br />
Of course it wasn't impossible. You know what else wouldn't be impossible? An encounter that made the raid gather in a perfect circle and do the hokey pokey every 26 seconds on the nose. It sure would be annoying and stupid, though...<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be a real tragedy if people had to adjust dynamically to a raid situation. I see your point. It's much funner when every single aspect of the fight is completely predictable and timed to the point where a downs syndrome guild can complete it.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see what is grown up about people defending nerfs to fights that didn't need them, using arguements that are totally invalid. If you can't beat a fight it's because your raid isnt up to the fight, not because the fight is above reasonable expectations.<br />
<br />

<br />
What the hell is the problem ? We killed Vezax after 6 Weeks with 3 Raids/12 hours per week, which means 2 fristkills per week. Back in the day, you would call this &quot;Nice instance, but a little to easy&quot;. Every boss that could be downed on the first night you try it is to easy. And no, I haven't beat sunwell.<br />
<br />
What's wrong with the RNG ? Yeah, it's hard and yeah, it's frustrating, yeah it fucked my brain. But that's the point of raiding: Making progress. And after a couple of hours on Yogg we were able to manage the tactic for phase 1 and were happy, despite RNG. Because we are able to learn the encounter and manage even unforseen RNG Events. But that's to much for most of todays players. You can greatly see how this affects random groups. One wipe in Naxx and the first peoples leave the group, moarning something about &quot;Haven't got all day, gimps blah blah blah.&quot; And then crying in the forums about how hard it is to see all content and how hard it is to get gear and how much the no-rl-raiding-guilds have to play and how much their rl affects them with their job, working 18 Hours per day and their girlfriend and their sport and their family and their parol officer and so on...<br />
<br />
With the nerfs, I don't even see the point of P1. Call a dmg stop at the right moment, finish them off in the center. No problem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joshua-Sensei</div><div class="date">2009-06-12, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;OMG the casuals have won!&quot; Do you all hear yourselves? I mean do you really? These nerfs weren't the cause of casual players it was the cause of you elitist players who haven't downed Yogg and the other bosses on hard mode yet. If you have downed them kudos if you haven't well, obviously you are not as ZOMG 1337 as you thought. Honestly if you really take the time to think about it, most &quot;casuals&quot; probably aren't past Hordir or Freya, that is IF they got past Iron council. Even if they are the reason for the nerf, Blizzard obviously thought that those &quot;casuals&quot; would not enjoy the game if they could not get past certain bosses, and who are you to argue? <br />
The casual players out number the &quot;real&quot; players in this game face it they do, there are no if ands or buts about it, they just do. Now if you were a business would you want to keep the smaller player base happy the ones who aren't providing as much money, or do you want to keep larger player base money providing the majority of your money? <br />
So your guild downed Yogg before this little nerf, well would you like a cookie? Would you like your time back? Huh. I payed 5000g for my epic flying and now it's going to be discounted, you don't see me whining about wanting my gold back, which in Wow is essentially just time, or luck. <br />
If you think the game has become too easy and hate the way things are handled go play another game, go out side get some sun, go on a date, spend time with your wife or kids, but don't blame the casual players for this nerf. That's like complaining that the guy next door doesn't work as hard as you but because he got an inheritance he has a prettier wife, nicer stuff, and a bigger house than you. There is nothing you can do about it so just get over it and keep plugging away at life.</div></div><hr />

I think you are the first guy who is on to something here. I mean..why else &quot;nerf&quot; a very pointless hardmode which was only there for a 10 point achievement?<br />
<br />
Yogg nerf feels still weird, maybe because it was mainly dpsing the brain and handling P3 was what gave us problems. But ofc there are others with other troubles..so what do I know.<br />
<br />
BTW: We killed Yogg last week for the first time..and this nerf won't diminish our pride (how can it) and ofc we don't care that now guilds have it a bit easier^^</div></div><hr />

This is the way I see it, this is my opionion and I am discussing it, and it is a change that has come to the game. There are three options if people are obviously so upset about it; 1) continue playing and just live with it, 2) continue playing but QQ about those damn casuals who are ruining your game. BAWWWWWAAAA 3) Stop playing. Plain and simple. <br />

Fact is lots of guilds like mine only raid 3 days a week 4 hours a night for a total of 12 hours a week *3rd grade math!* and still managed to kill yogg and some hardmodes before nerfs. There is nothing wrong with normal modes being easy esp. earlier bosses in the instance, but, imo final bosses ie yogg and hardmodes &quot;Hard is in the name lol&quot; should be hard...... So you don't have 20, 25, 30 hours to dedicate to raiding... no one said you have to. god forbid it takes you a whole content patch to clear the normal mode content. People go on saying &quot;omg only 5% killed yogg it must be to hard&quot; A total of what? 1% were able to kill muru and kill KJ before it was nerfed 1 month before the expansion. sooo more people have currently killed yogg then were ever able to kill KJ yet somehow yogg is to hard? XT nerf on the heart I have no problem with as lol chain heart phase happens to us and its hardly a boss because of it, but really to nerf light and gravity bombs? Wtb some kind of balance here. Make normal modes beginner mode so any random 25 retards can walk in on a 4 hour raid schedule and kill all the content then get back to thier so called &quot;real lives&quot; because somehow people can't have a real life and play wow for raid progression &quot;yet the majority of my guild has PHD's and are happily married&quot; and keep hardmodes hard for people who actually play for the purpose of challenging scenarios to overcome with 24 other people they enjoy talking to and hanging out with online. nerdrage QQ gtfo blah blah. oh noes i killed KJ pre nerf on a 3 day raid schedule therefore i must be elitist and have no life. lol it's a community forum and this whole post doesn't matter as blizz will not read these posts or even care about them. OH MY GOD WOW IS A GAME. I enjoy the time i spend with the 24-30 other members of my guild reguardless of how stupidly easy or awesomely difficult blizzard makes the content and will continue to play.

Back in the days there were no hard-modes. Blizzard would just have released most bosses as they are now in the hard modes (or halfway, like maybe FL with 2 towers etc).

500 guilds have done LV x 4. Let's check back in 2 or 3 weeks if this is really &quot;nerfed to the ground&quot; - by your words I expect this pugged soon ^^quote author=Relion link=topic=63539.msg1024148#msg1024148 date=1244893361]<br />
<br />
It's an indication that 94% of the world guilds consists of people who can't fucking dress themselves.<br />
<br />
I am 100% convinced Blizzard is doing this on purpose, and the closer we come to the next MMO, the faster these kind of nerfs will happen. Since a big chunk of the original WoW-crew is working on the next MMO you can assume that those with lesser talent are working on WoW at the moment. Ghost &quot;Get more resilit will be fine&quot; Crawler and his legion of interns are the reason I quit after clearing out Ulduar in the first week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Care to link your Algalon kill or are you just one of the 99.99% (That's repeating of course) who don't now how to play this game?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nobody killed Algalon the first week, what are you talking about? It should be obvious to anyone that I meant everything but Algalon, the fact that Algalon himself is hard and getting to him is an obstacle does not excuses the rest of the instance poor design&amp;difficulty decisions.<br />
<br />
Like say, XT's 25-man hardmode before it was fixed. In other fields of work half-assed work gets punished sometimes, but WoW does have a legion of morons who excuse everything wrong with Ulduar because Algalon exists :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2009-06-13, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you claimed you &quot;cleared&quot; Ulduar the first week, then quit. Maybe it is just me who thinks &quot;cleared&quot; means &quot;killed every boss&quot; - but hell..I am no native speaker..learn something every day.<br />
<br />
So you quit after killing 13 of 14 bosses and claim that 94% of the players in &quot;the world guilds consists of people who can't fucking dress themselves&quot;. <br />
<br />
So I just want to make sure you can back up those claims. Good for you that the claim of &quot;the instance poor design&amp;difficulty decisions.&quot; is 100% down to personal taste and needs no facts to back. On the other hand, over 2 million players seem to enjoy the place...<br />
<br />
Care satisfy our curiosity and link your achievement where you killed Yogg in the first week?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like to see the nerdrage when &quot;Firefighter&quot; is made easier, because all of 24 guilds did that achieve and probably a number greater than 600 players will come here and moan about that nerf, as if they all managed to achieve this fight.<br />
<br />
I still don't see anybody who foams here in rage linking THEIR &quot;heroic heartbreaker&quot;...achieved by 350 guilds and thus by approximately 8000 players.<br />
<br />
Gotta be somebody of those elites here on the forum? Well..gotta be at least 100 of those elites on this forum going by the hate posts....<br />
<br />
<br />
You just don't get it, do you ?<br />
The people complaining are not the ones who actually beat the encounters. The people complaining are the ones that WANTED to beat the same hard encounter and not a nerfed-omg-we-accidently-pulled-the-boss-together-with-two-trashpacks-and-forget-to-loot-after-the-bombing-version. And they're right. This has nothing to do with &quot;Look at me, I'm so elite&quot;, but with &quot;Why didn't we get a chance to beat the same encounter?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in the days there were no hard-modes. Blizzard would just have released most bosses as they are now in the hard modes (or halfway, like maybe FL with 2 towers etc). Good luck killing Freya with 3 adds on the first night. Clearing Ulduar in normal mode cannot be compared to pre-Wotlk raiding, it just isn't the same.<br />
<br />
Hardmodes still aren't content. There is nothing greater for a raider to beat a challenging boss for the first time, after days of wiping. Beating a boss a second time while controlling your character with your tongue while both hands on your back is not the same.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, there are a few people who posted this and are disappointed about this. And I can see their point. But of that is not what most post on these 16 pages are about.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard claim Hardmodes are new content? <br />
<br />
And the second time you beat a boss, you have new pieces of gear from clearing the Instance up to that boss. After 4 weeks of killing Yogg, you will have have killed a minimum of 8 bosses each week, with a minimum of 2 pieces of &quot;better&quot; gear, that is 64 items, or 2-3 new items for each raider. Technically, you are degressing, your dps is much higher, you are in control of your encounters - yet you kill the same boss again and again - the one you could kill 4 weeks ago in your inferior gear.<br />
<br />
This apparently was no problem for people who cleared Instances like MC, BWL etc, etc up to BT again and again. Ulduar offers you a possibility to keep encounters fresh and challenging with harder modes.<br />
<br />
Obviously you do not need to accept them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nidhöggr</div><div class="date">2009-06-13, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, you're right about the farming-bosses part.<br />
But raiding is all about firstkills and those firstkills doesn't count that much when you're able to beat a boss with a minimum of effort, because you can beat them in half-a-dozend other ways later on in different hardmodes. And please stop talking about &quot;Then why don't you just do hardmodes?&quot; - we both know that there are only a handful of guilds that are able to do so, nevertheless the middle-class raids with a shorter raiding week (12 hours, in my raid for example) - maybe even less skill - but with ambition wanted to have the &quot;right&quot; raiding experience.<br />
<br />
There has never been a greater motivation for raiding but to see guilds that are way better than you, talking about bosses you never have seen, wearing those shiny gear you always wanted to get. To make a point: Most of us ARE only mediocre raiders, so am I and so are (likely) you.That was the carrot on the stick for most of us the past 4 years. But because of the current instance-releasing philosophy, because of easy- and hardmode, because of 10 Man and 25 man raids, the myth is gone. WoW was way better when you knew you wouldn't see everything and won't wear the best looking gear available (because it's all about style, isn't it?!) but regardless you tryed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2009-06-13, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm..okay. In the case of Ulduar it is indeed only one boss that I will never see. You are right that most raiders are average...a very small elite, a chunk of good players and of cause really bad players too...and many, many who just don't care or have the time to invest in raiding.<br />
<br />
Yes, Unless the hardmodes of the keepers are nerfed significantly, I am sure my guild will never be able to do Firefighter. We might be able to beat Hodir and Throrim's hardmode. But not seing Algalon is fine with us - just like we were okay that we would never get past Brutallus in SWP (before 3.0).<br />
<br />
The joy of killing a boss for the first time, especially a late game boss is fantastic. You could say we were lucky that Blizzard didn't really touch BT for over 8 months...it meant we could eventually kill Illidan including all achievements and attunements..a really long and satisfying way. But ofc the fact that there was no new content caused problems for other, more advanced guilds who fel apart by boredom.<br />
<br />
And many invented their own ..shall we call it..hardmodes and achievements: Fusion did BT speedclears in under 90 mins, Kararuns in under an hour were made...etc.</div></div><hr />

Same. On XT we had to drop 2 healers, and EVERY dps had to use timers+some sort of 15 sec potion just to get the heart down in time. Best attempt was 40%, but by that time our 3 healers were oom. <br />
<br />
In the past, this far into new content (other than KJ. He was the only raid boss we never killed pre-nerf.) would be about the time we had all content on farm. We are still doing 5 nights a week, 6 hours a night, and I am sure as hell getting sick of having my life put on hold in the name of progression. Every monday night we have to cut our losses and any hard modes we failed we go easy mode with and the whole week just feels like a giant waste. <br />
If hard modes getting nerfed means I can get some more nights off from raiding then I WELCOME the nerfs.</div></div><hr />

How am I suppose to feel better then other people online because I can do something online that they cant. Wait...... I forgot I am Married with a job where i work 48+ hours a weeks saving lives helping people ( FireFighter/EMT ). I for one am happy when they tone things down. I cant invest alot of time in wow and when I play, I play to relax ( Knowing you can die anytime you get a call can be stressful sometimes ). Learning a boss is one thing but banging your head against a wall for weeks can hurt. I know I am not in a bleeding edge group but I do enjoy the people I am with, which ranks higher to me. Sure wow is great but its not my job it wont feed me or my family. If something I enjoy to do becomes more enjoy-able I am all for it. Final note: if doing something online that others cant do then teasing them when might have a chance at it makes you feel good about yourself read that sentence a few more times till it sinks in.</div></div><hr />

SO if raids to hard for noobs. they need to nerft it. Because if they not nerfing it.. then after 1 month noobs will stop playing wow because they will say they cant get loot. SO NO PLAYERS = NO GAME CARDS= NO MONEY= WOW END. How simple is that. I know it is sad.. but i think that is the true.</div></div><hr />

Seriously if the fact that a boss got changed made you rage then maybe you should stop playing. <br />
<br />
When Naxx/Maly/Sarth came out i joined a pretty hardcore guild and managed to get twilight vanq/of the night fall/ undying, no immortal tho, and 6min maly on heroic and normal. Then ulduar hit and i left the guild because raiding 4-5 days a week for 4 hours just wasnt fun. Now im in a guild that raids 3 days a week about 3 1/2 hour each time. <br />
<br />
Point being i looked back and realized that ALL of what i had done in regards to content was mostly for my epeen. Seriously a title is a title but dont tell me you didnt /afk near a bank entrance when you first got your of the nightfall title. <br />
<br />
Stop complaining about content, its up to blizz to decide what they want to do with a raid. If your raiding to get firsts or to do hardmodes realize that wow is just a game and in a couple of years no one will remember what you did so all your arguing and complaining is worthless. Its totally fair for 90% of a video game to never see all of the game? Seriously i bet most of you want these modes to remain harder so that when you do them you can stroke your epeen more.<br />
<br />
TL;DR shut up about nerfs</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seriously thought that we'd done with that particular argument some time back. 90% can easily get to see all of the game if they wish to with a minimum amount of effort* by doing Ulduar 10. Frankly, they can probably do Ulduar 25 normal mode too now. We're talking in this thread about nerfs to hard modes, which as I understood it aren't 'content' that everyone gets to see by virtue of paying their subscription but were meant to be there as a challenge for the dedicated. Oh, and to the others, please quit with the obscenities, it really doesn't make you seem grown up, in fact quite the opposite.<br />
