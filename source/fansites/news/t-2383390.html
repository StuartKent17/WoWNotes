Probably not. The Alpha only goes to level 113 currently and there are copious amounts of bugs, missing talents, and a whole host of other issues currently. Beta is probably another 2 or so months out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The alpha actually goes up to 116 and it really isn't that crazy to think the final two zones will go live with with the beta itself. In two months we'll probably see the pre-patch hit PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These developer Q&amp;As are not made for us, the ones that practically live on the forums and follow any news. They are made for the people who still don't know that there have been development on more than the two allied races revealed at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warning</div><div class="date">2018-03-12, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Destro Soul Fire talent should probably be an instant nuke on a 45 second CD instead of a cast that is too similar to Chaos Bolt and steals its thunder somewhat. A significant instant on demand burst would be an interesting option in both PVP and PVE, where you can decide to commit it at just the right moment to get something down quick. We used to have this option in cata and it felt very nice unloading that extra bit of barrage on occasion and while also giving you a bit of burst even while being heavily tunneled.</div></div><hr />

BH is in the 92nd percentile of server population and like 96th percentile in raiding population and its being considered dead which is pretty worrying, every server in the raiding scene wants to be like Illidan or Sargeras where there is around 25k+ players to choose from. I'm really hoping with the new change to the PvP and PvE toggle they just eliminate the idea of servers and just have 1 or 2 NA servers where they just shard people. Additionally this will fix the problem where the horde and alliance servers are grossly imbalanced.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, his approach is dry as the dryest toast. Let's freaking see the spells please. Nope, just gonna talk about them for 5-10 minutes. 40minute video - I'm not watching that, waste of fucking time sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly I'd rather they announce some contents.<br />
Allied Races are a nice addition but I have the feeling they're spending way too much time and dedication on this feature than on the real game.<br />
<br />
Where are talents ? Azerite ? Dungeons ? Raids ? Battlegrounds ? Zones ? Quests ? Lore ?<br />
<br />
Literally nothing, only reskins for the time being. I'm starting to worry.</div></div><hr />

Hmm? I am not even talking about the legendary one. The f*cking epic one... I have 8 upgrades but 0 trinket... WTF????? And some say it is not even sure if I get my first one on my main spec. <br />
<br />
Druids cannot even complete all four trinkets before the next exp. How retarded is that?</div></div><hr />

And yet if you look at the thread for questions you'll see most of the people asking about allied races, player models and artifact transmog.. let me just add I'm with you on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Becuase they have realised they can make insane amount of money by the allied races. In my guild almost every 2nd player bought a boost or a race change or both... They made so much money. When the orcs and trolls come, ohh boy it is like another expansion for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alfa, beta or what you want to call it doesnâ€™t matter. The alpha of BFA is a lot more fleshed out and working than the beta of TBC as an example. The alfa build of BFA is more of a demo of what to come.</div></div><hr />
