Patch notes update<br />
We had a preview of most of these changes on the talent calculator updates, however there are a few new things here. <br />

Is reading really that hard for you or are you just a mongoloid? I said that I'm glad that Shield Wall is getting a buff of 10% reduction since it had been nerfed to the same 50% as the new paladin version. </div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groktar</div><div class="date">2008-08-22, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So DKs are getting a regular taunt this patch or next? Pretty sure it wasn't in the last build.<br />
<br />
Pestilence still spreads diseases.<br />
<br />
Blood Boil does damage to an area per disease. It is very similar to Blood Strike, but affects an area (and doesn't hit as hard as a result). Making it a more core ability let us tie more talents to it. Pestilence and Blood Boil play really nice together.<br />
<br />
We gave DKs a new taunt and changed Death Grip to work like Mocking Blow (it makes the target attack you, but doesn't change your threat).<br />
<br />
As we started dealing with tanking some more, we were worried that a druid and warrior-like taunt is just too fundamental a tool. Because Death Grip has some massive PvP implications, we risked the DK taunt getting pushed to a longer cooldown if we ever needed to change Death Grip. The old Blood Boil would always be awkward to use as a taunt since it required one or two attacks before it to really work.<br />
<br />
At the moment there is no true Challenging Shout, but Army of the Dead is pretty good for using in those situations because the ghouls all taunt, which will save any healers or casters in trouble. It is probably an overpowered ability currently, but at least you won't be disappointed when you hit 80. <br />

<br />
Fury gets a healing debuff opening it up for PvP.<br />
<br />
Arms gets some great flat damage increases and much better burst. The new Enraged Assault looks great. If you look past the Mace Spec nerf which was nescessary to stop Arms warrior being a one-trick pony there are lots of really great changes to the talents in both trees.<br />
<br />
It looks like warriors might end up with 2 DPS trees, both viable for both PvP and PvE or at least that seems to be the goal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nubs</div><div class="date">2008-08-22, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glyph of Bestial Wrath - Decreases the cooldown of Bestial Wrath by 20 sec. <br />
Can't believe no one is crying about this yet, with longevity, it decreases CD of TBW by 30%. So normally the CD is 2 minutes (120 seconds), which would bring the CD down to 84 seconds. Then with the glyph take off an additional 20 seconds, bringing the cool down down to 64 seconds.<br />
<br />
Or worst case scenario, 120 seconds - 20 seconds then 30% which would be a 70 second CD.<br />
<br />
But then again, the Rogue glyphs are pretty strong too and this seems to be the only &quot;OP&quot; one</div></div><hr />

There's a few I've not included of talents moving around in trees to different Tiers, etc.<br />
<br />
FURY<br />
<br />
New Talent: Furious Attacks - Normal Melee attacks have 50/100% chance to reduce healing on target by 25% for 8 sec. stacks up to 2 times.<br />
<br />
Imp berserk rage: 10/20 rage gained (buffed from 5/10)<br />
<br />
Intensify Rage: reduces cd on Berserker Rage, Bloodrage, Deathwish and Recklessness by 11/22/33%<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Except the DoT component accounts for about 6% of Fireball's Damage, so you're losing damage overall, albeit only a small bit, there is no reason to use this Glyph.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sorry, I'm a bit off. A single Cast FB at about 1100 damage would result in a loss of damage if you're using this glyph.<br />
<br />
Chain casting with about 1800 +dmg (reasonable at 80) you would get about a 4% increase.</div></div><hr />

Why are warriors so convinced that arms is worthless now? Do you still get imp intercept, imp hamstring and second wind with 51 points for titans grip or something?<br />
<br />
Sure you get heroic leap, but you're going to have to wait every 30 seconds(25 if they keep the arena bonus) and 45 seconds to get back into range. You're going to be even easier to kite in LK if you fight good teams who control, arms isnt dead, its all about flavor now.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how &quot;not getting any combo points&quot; is a good thing.<br />
<br />
The &quot;no longer does damage&quot; i could understand for a CC standpoint, but combo points are rather useful to have either way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
500 arena points for winning Wintergasp ? Woah.. no more arena ? D:<br />
<br />
<br />
Likely they're adding &quot;Arena-2&quot; points. Thus making the 5th season of arena a completely new point system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enough with the warrior changes now...<br />

<br />
Well, look at it that way. There are two enemies (wether it's PvP or PvE, doesn't matter).<br />
You're focussing on one to get it down, but decide that the other one is getting annoying<br />
(starts to cast, does too much damage, whatever).<br />
<br />
You can now choose to:<br />
- Lose all combo points on your current target to Gouge the other enemy, thus breaking the cast.<br />
- Use the remaining combo points to Eviscerate/Slice'n'dice/whatever and risk letting the cast through.<br />
<br />
With Gouge no longer giving a combo point, you can just switch your target to Gouge, get back on your<br />
other target and not lose any combo points at all. It makes the use of Gouge much more flexible, because<br />
you're not having to deal with a possible loss of combo points. Just use it, whenever you please.</div></div><hr />

Titan's grip is great now, I have a feeling they'll nerf it though. Ramage &lt;3 but I have a feeling Arms is dead for PvE now :( I could be wrong.

and why they moved slam?<br />
in my opinion arms should 100% pvp with burst dmg/stuns/reduce healing and fury should be 100% pve with raid dmg/raid buffs/threat reduce and not that mix we have now ...<br />
but its good that blizz is looking/working on warriors talents :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Fury will still remain the hardcore PvE tree. Increased threat reduction and titans grip will clearly win this one. I LOVE that slam is now in arms WHERE IT BELONGS. Slam is an integral part of a PvE arms warriors rotation and you have to go up a long way in fury to get it. Now those who still want a blood frenzy pve build can go deep into arms for many of the other good talents.<br />
<br />
I see the opening of fury for PvP as more opportunities for warriors rather than less. Arms is still the premier PvP spec when paired with another class such as druid/paladin. Imp intercept/hamstring/second wind/bladestorm ensures that. However, I see Arms/Fury setups starting to come out as a strong possibility. Imp intercept plus heroic leap, you can keep MS up on both targets with triviality. The idea would be similar to warrior/rogue just with different benefits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's a VERY necessary nerf though. The reason that fury warriors started swapping to arms was because with gear arms was viable enough to start bring in blood frenzy, which is a huge buff especially in melee-heavy setups. Blizzard finally introduced raid utility for fury warriors beyond imp shout with 5% crit aura ala LotP. Still, consider 4% increased dmg on all melee attacks or 5% crit aura. If you run a melee heavy setup, that's a very easy choice to make; your warrior will stay arms. <br />
<br />
Just like the dethroning of Mace spec as the premier PvP build, this ensures that fury continues to maintain that edge in PvE making it a no-brainer while not disenfranchising arms entirely. I see us taking one arms warrior to raids, not because we made him go arms but because he likes to play it more. These new trees offer us choices that previously we really didn't have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you can't have it + MS?<br />
<br />
The new Arms and Fury specs are clearly showing that they don't want anymore Hybrid Arms/Fury to be the default spec for Raids.<br />
<br />
Full Fury isn't as good as even a full Arms could be (Blood Frenzy basically owned everything) today. There is no &quot;blood frenzy like&quot; to make going deep fury usefull for raids. They only had pure DPS to try earn a raid spot (arms can get the shout buffs, and hybrid owns with MS, Blood Frenzy, imp.shouts, flurry...) And the old &quot;new&quot; deep Fury was going to suck really hard (slow Titan Grip, Rampage sucked, etc... etc...).<br />
<br />
The reason for Fury to have this &quot;MS&quot; is to let PvE warriors going deep fury and also take the healing debuff together with their &quot;blood frenzy&quot; raid booster (rampage). It's also usefull for PvP, yes, but I guess that Arms will still be better at that (one high damage hit with lesser chance to miss aplying full debuff + all the improved tools to keep the warrior in melee range like imp.intercet, imp.hamstring... that fury won't have).<br />
<br />
The Blood Frenzy nerf kinda suck, but... maybe it's to keep hybrids in check.<br />
<br />
For the Slam thing, check one of the talents in fury tree, you have chance to cast slam instant. It's way faster than imp.slam. And imp.slam + this talent + Titan Grip would really suck (for the opponents hehehe).<br />
<br />
Also that helps much more Arms warriors and since they want to give more chances for deep arms and deep fury, they gave this &quot;one 2hander&quot; talent to arms, so they can keep their slam rotation without problems and too many points spent in Fury. And without that, maybe not every fury warrior will be a titan grip warrior (of course, if they nerf the new titan grip, if not, all fury warriors will be TG warriors hehe, no reason to not use it without speed penalty).<br />
<br />
And WotLK warriors finally look much more lvl 80 than just &quot;fixed lvl 70s&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I could ask if you're reading what I was typing.<br />
<br />
To make it more clear: BALANCE is fine. Gimping another class is not fine.<br />
<br />
I was merely pointing out that currently in the burning crusade warlocks are extremely weak against any melee (mages are doing a lot better on this departement). This fact is somewhat balanced out because we're extremely strong against casters. Now, in WOTLK, we will be weak against both casters AND melee, which is what I'm concerned about. Can I put it any more clearly so you'd understand?<br />
<br />
Balance = fine.<br />
Being weak against any class = not fine.<br />
<br />
Mages should know this tbh.<br />
<br />
Edit: ok one more clarification...<br />
It's fine that they nerf warlocks against casters, but in return we should get increased survivability against melee. (currently we're losing survivability compared to TBC)</div></div><hr />

You're not talking about the poly glyph, are you? If so ... gg. Since when can you poly a friendly/yourself to remove dots and if your mage uses it in pvp, then it's only to your benefit - unless you play a poly/interrupt strat but in that case you mage partner won't be picking up that glyph.<br />
<br />
As to your comments about balance, it's not over until we see lvl 80 content i.e. ALL new class abilities chomping away in arenas and raids. Until that's out, it's far too early to cry over/underpowered. It'd be wiser to focus more on concepts than final numbers.</div></div><hr />

Errr excuse me? Warriors have gone unchanged since the dawn of BC, and that's with underwhelmingly mediocre changes unless you were prot... And we were a one trick pony in arena that I'm surprised anybody has been beaten by. &quot;LOL MACE STUN/HEAL DEBUFF/ LOL WAIT SPELLS/POISON/BLEEDS GO THROUGH PLATE AND WE CAN BE KITED NVM&quot;<br />
<br />
And fury? Fury has seen nothing but disappointing nerfs and &quot;Meh&quot; itemization (Our T6 for example) since BC. The most common thing a warrior hears isn't nerf but &quot;NEED MORE RAGE, NOT ENOUGH RAGE, IT'S TOO FAR AWAY... You have died....<br />
<br />
And on a note outside of the arguement record: I&quot;m a tad butthurt 2H fury has been DESTROYED now since IMP slam has been moved to deep arms... was a fun spec.<br />
<br />
And this build? Buffs fury a tiny bit, and probably not enough to make that titan grip &quot;Joke&quot; playable beyond the raid going &quot;MMM FREE CRIT.&quot;. And nueters arms relevance in alot of cases, so -where- are you pulling this &quot;LOL WARRIORS SPOONFED BUFF LOLOLOL&quot; and what class do YOU play?<br />
<br />
Hell on a personal opinion.... Screw Arms, every dumb nerf and talent swap I've gotten has been for arms sake. &quot;lol have some death wish&quot; then when I get death wish back... Oh lookie, no longer breaks fears. So I get my toy taken away, broken, and handed back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2x 2handers, with no speed penalty.. can you imagine the damage that will cause with just your whrilwind? <br />
<br />
not to mention how good it is when you could pretty much quadruple your stats while dualweilding (stats on 2handers usually 2x as much as 1handers AND 2handed weapon enchants)<br />
<br />
Fury is the dual weild tree.. why would you use 2h weapon with fury build?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HurfDurf</div><div class="date">2008-08-22, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For fun? But like I said, that was an outside of the arguement mildly butthurt opinion of mine. And my original post was more directed to the person crying about a warrior buff when it's really not that big of a deal or buff in anyone's eyes compared to all of the other class changes... (And yes other classes and specs have been ignored in the new skill/talent department too. I'm not forgetting you, I'm just talking about MY class and spec for now.)<br />
<br />
But you also have to factor in, swinging 2xTwo Handers... Once you get the ball rolling and can keep it rolling you should be golden, but wouldn't you rage starve compared to traditional dual wielding? Add to the fact that missing with a weapon that beefy and slow is gonna hurt you bad, so you're going to want to get to the hit cap even more than traditional dual wield... Which in turn makes the rest of your stats lower. (There was a post on one of the major raid boards called the hit cap trap that explained this.)<br />
<br />
I do admit to being a little quick on the trigger to call it a joke now with no speed penalty, but I can't really see how it can be terribly viable without tweaking fury (which was designed around 2.6/1.9 speed weapons) to match... Then again, I don't know what the itemization is going to be like in WOTLK, so I'm changeing my stance to &quot;Cautiously Optimistic&quot;</div></div><hr />

They worked on mages, warriors, and hunters, next up are druids, paladin, rogues, priests probably.

They worked on mages, warriors, and hunters, next up are druids, paladin, rogues, priests probably.

<br />
So where are warlocks? I've been waiting long enough for my class to be fixed i the beta! I dont wanna be the only class they dont work on! I want to see changes to my talents and such! Anyways...like the changes to the other classes so far, hope everyone will have fun with em when wrath hits live ;D.</div></div><hr />

Same with warlock/mage/priest. There probably just placeholders, Blizz said officially they were making seperate looking gear for the classes PVE and PVP sets, so no more copies of the looks =D(still like the s3/t6 helm warlocks have, wings ftw)</div></div><hr />

The shoulder plates of the silver hand, as was told in the eitrigg and tirion book, were a big deal to them, they were clean, they were solid silver etc. They're not warsong hold grunt spaulders, even if i do like that gear.

You sound like an awful player. Have you ever broken 1500?<br />
<br />
Yea try kiting a class with a 15 second distance closer that stuns you for 3 seconds, procs more stuns on you, slows your movement speed by 50%, reflects spells, debuffs your healing, etc etc.....<br />
<br />
Also, spells go through all armor, you're not any worse off than any other class.<br />
<br />
QQ more, there's a reason warriors were on almost every team in BC, especially 5v5.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't believe your complaining about a 6 second window free of being cursed. I guess in your eyes any new change is seen as a nerf to the almighty Warlock huh?<br />
<br />
<br />
You're fucking retarded. Remove curse has no cooldown, just decurse them again after 6 seconds. What this means is CoEx is worthless vs. melee, CoT is worthless vs. casters, in short, our utility debuffs (curses) are going to be worthless vs. a mage.<br />
<br />
It was ok in BC the mage had to spend just as much time decursing as you did putting them up. Now he gets 6 seconds of invulnerability for 1.5 seconds of GCD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To make it more clear: BALANCE is fine. Gimping another class is not fine.<br />
<br />
I was merely pointing out that currently in the burning crusade warlocks are extremely weak against any melee (mages are doing a lot better on this departement). This fact is somewhat balanced out because we're extremely strong against casters. Now, in WOTLK, we will be weak against both casters AND melee, which is what I'm concerned about. Can I put it any more clearly so you'd understand?<br />
<br />
Balance = fine.<br />
Being weak against any class = not fine.<br />
<br />
Mages should know this tbh.<br />
<br />
Edit: ok one more clarification...<br />
It's fine that they nerf warlocks against casters, but in return we should get increased survivability against melee. (currently we're losing survivability compared to TBC)<br />
<br />
<br />
QQ more. That's suposed to happen when a CLOTHIE gets in melee range. Want plate?!?! <br />
<br />
What about melee getting owned hard when they're not in melee?!?! Ah, that &quot;should happen when you're not in melee range against ranged classes&quot; right? LoL</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajaxthegreat</div><div class="date">2008-08-23, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah because that talent totally says it has no internal cooldown and is guaranteed to be up 100% of the time like the passive Leader of the Pack. And it totally says it doesn't stack with Leader of the Pack.<br />
<br />
First, if your fury warrior isn't critting at least once every ten seconds, just quit the game right now. <br />
<br />
They are trying to split the feral tree into cat talents and bear talents, thus allowing ferals the opportunity to specialize into a melee dps or a main tank role. Said dps will always be lower than the pure dps classes due to the vaulted utility brought by the class. LotP is a PARTY buff, while Rampage is a RAIDWIDE buff; which would you rather have? One feral tank using mangle to apply the debuff (as well as faerie fire), and the vastly superior spec (resto) brings the battle rez and innervate, marginalizing feral dps builds. A feral dps brings nothing to the table now that isn't brought by someone else, as well as poorly scaled dps that puts them on the bench anyway: why bring one?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait, it doesn't say either of those things and you're spewing nonsense. Got it.<br />

I don't understand that glyph. <br />
<br />
1.) Looks like there isn't going to be any Strength on Feral gear, and even if there was, how often do ferals run out of mana in a raid?<br />
2.) Boomkins or Trees who would be likely to use it on someone else are going to have even less strength than the Feral Druids.</div></div><hr />

Chain casting with about 1800 +dmg (reasonable at 80) you would get about a 4% increase.<br />
