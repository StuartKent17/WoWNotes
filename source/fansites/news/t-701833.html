Patch 3.3.3 Pet - Lil'XT and Celestial Dragon<br />
One of the latest 3.3.3 PTR build added a new pet to the game: Lil' XT (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75906/lil-xt/). We don't know what the drop location is for the moment but the name is very similar to Lil' KT from the Blizzard Store and the description mentions &quot;Action Figure&quot;, it might be another pet that players can get out of the game. (But not necessarily)<br />
<br />
He looks pretty cute and has a couple of unique animations + its own voice!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Also, the Celestial Dragon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75613/celestial-dragon/)'s model has been updated once again, it now uses the same armor as the Celestial Steed (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KvDDFi0Fuo).<br />

Not likely. Been waiting for disable logging screen scream (of the frostwyrm) for some time. Its kinda retarded you have to log into game, turn off sounds, and then whenever you log off/in no more screaming. Same way for Lil XT.</div></div><hr />

As far as lil'XT, it looks awesome, probably going to be sold for real life $$$. So it's completely shit.<br />

But at least pets bought with real money serve a purpose. Like pants that sag below underwear, they let you identify idiots from a distance. So it's not all bad.<br />

Good god, you need to increase your Intellect. So no one has anything to say about the updated Celestial Dragon design sharing the same armor as the Celestial Steed? Something tells me the Steed will be from 25M Algalon and the Dragon will be from 10M Algalon, which is pretty lame considering a good amount of raiders out there actually farmed both for quite awhile with nothing to show for it aside from a title and outdated loot. Anything to get overgeared ToC Champions to go back to content they can barely do with todays gear.</div></div><hr />

Not completely shit, just annoying.<br />
<br />
<br />
But at least pets bought with real money serve a purpose. Like pants that sag below underwear, they let you identify idiots from a distance. So it's not all bad.<br />
They let everyone have access to something cool even if they aren't good at WoW or aren't able to get the really cool stuff for some other reason. I really don't see any harm in it as long as it doesn't go as far as blizzard selling gear or some other character-enhancing items.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be really sad for the game if they started selling mounts for real world cash. The non-combat pets are bad enough.<br />
They've been doing it for a while through the TCG so I wouldn't be surprised. I hope they don't but will have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

tbh i wouldnt even mind that all that much, i hadn't been in my guild long enough when ulduar was out to get in the ten man that killed him and our 25 wasnt able to do it before toc and we never went back.<br />

They haven't. But look at the map of VoA and tell me that it looks finished to you.<br />

And WHY would there be a 5th boss added? ICC is the last big raid instance, won't be any gear higher than t10 until Cataclysm hits, so what gear would this 5th boss drop? And aren't we in the last Arena season too?</div></div><hr />

But it's a shiny, sparkly dwagon and the only thing the Twilight Dragonflight shares with the similarly-named abomination is 1 word. There will be no dwagons that sparkle and glow in the sunlight in the ruby sanctum.</div></div><hr />

3.3.3 was supposed to be minor to hotfix some balancing issues with classes? or am I completely out on a limb here :O ? <br />
<br />
eg frost dks who have been waiting to become raid viable again since the start of 3.3, patch or hotfix plox. S getting annoying waiting for the developpers to finish their bag of crisps to get some work done. Cataclysm might be the latest brainchild for ensuring the cash still rolls, but please don't forsake the people already playing the game <br />

So no one has anything to say about the updated Celestial Dragon design sharing the same armor as the Celestial Steed? Something tells me the Steed will be from 25M Algalon and the Dragon will be from 10M Algalon, which is pretty lame considering a good amount of raiders out there actually farmed both for quite awhile with nothing to show for it aside from a title and outdated loot. Anything to get overgeared ToC Champions to go back to content they can barely do with todays gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know why they'd add whats probably the best mount in the game to a boss from two tiers ago.<br />
<br />
I'm still expecting it to be some kind of super meta of the other raid metas for the Celestial Steed, with 25 man giving the mount and 10man giving the pet or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's anger. You're throwing a fit over something that people might pay real money to have, in a game that everyone who plays it - yourself included - pays money to play. <br />
<br />
You ever buy an accessory for your car? According to you, you're an idiot. You ever buy a second pair of shoes, when you already have one? Idiot. Get dessert after you eat? Idiot.<br />
<br />
If people want to pay for something that changes nothing in the game and does nothing but give them some enjoyment, that's their right.</div></div><hr />

And of course disappointment with blizzard for going in this direction with the game. Especially after blizzard (and the makers of... pretty much every other MMO ever) preached and ranted against selling in-game currency/items for real world money.<br />
<br />
<br />
They've been doing this since day one. Bought a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; of the original boxed game (or any expansion)? You &quot;bought&quot; a non-com pet. Paid to go to Blizz-Con (or more recently even for the stream)? You &quot;bought&quot; a non-com pet. Bought TCG decks? You &quot;bought &quot; a chance at a non-com pet. Never done any of these things? Doesn't matter. Other people have. Blizz has been selling non-com pets since the game was released. This is just a more direct version of what they've always done. It has no affect on the game whether you have Lil' XT or not. Why hate on people that choose to spend the money?<br />
<br />
Having said that, I won't buy it. I don't see any purpose in spending more cash on pixels than I already do, but I can totally see why some people like them. I did buy the Gryphon, but that was more because I wanted the plush for my wife than the in game pet. I'll use the code of course, but I didn't buy it for that.</div></div><hr />

As far as lil'XT, it looks awesome, probably going to be sold for real life $$$. So it's completely shit.<br />
<br />
But at least pets bought with real money serve a purpose. Like pants that sag below underwear, they let you identify idiots from a distance. So it's not all bad.<br />

<br />
They started selling mounts for real world cash ever since the Spectral Tiger was released. GET OVER IT ALREADY.<br />
<br />
Along with that, if they go on the Blizzard Store, they'll be on store anywhere between 10-30$<br />
<br />
EVERY SINGLE MOUNT that came from the TCG is going for 400-800$<br />

<br />
Yes you are.<br />
<br />
They are completely over hauling the PVP system , getting rid of battleground marks and adding a Random Battleground tool (like the random dugeon finder we have today).<br />
<br />
There are sweeping honor changes both in terms of how much items cost and in terms of much you get from kills and battleground objectives.<br />
<br />
There's also a few graphical engine changes as well.<br />
<br />
IMHO nothing minor about this patch.</div></div><hr />

Basically you recreate the file path for the sound you want to replace. When the client loads it will load your sound instead. Just find the path for the dragon or XT and recreate the path for those sounds.<br />

<br />
<br />
IE To replace the sound &quot;UR_XT002_Special01.wav&quot; you would first create in your Data folder a folder called &quot;Sound&quot; in that would be a folder &quot;Creature&quot; then in that a folder &quot;XT002Deconstructor&quot;. in the folder &quot;XT002Deconstructor&quot; you would put a &quot;UR_XT002_Special01.wav&quot; file. Make it a short 4k no noise .wav and you silence the &quot;UR_XT002_Special01.wav&quot; sound.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping the pet will have it's own sounds so you can silence it using this method but not XT's sounds</div></div><hr />

People who work hard at something, no matter what that something is, should be rewarded for it. Being an 'epic raider' is not required for any mount except the current top-tie content and even that doesn't last forever. If it is an epic achievement mount then everyone will be able to go back and get it when Cataclysm hits (remember how the Ulduar mounts are still available).<br />
You sound extremely bitter about not being able to be an epic raider, for whatever reason that is. Perhaps it's you with the problem that needs looking at rather than them?<br />
There is nothing wrong with given epic looking items to epic players (although I do think there's something wrong with giving epic looking items to players who pay epic amounts of money to epic players for them).</div></div><hr />
