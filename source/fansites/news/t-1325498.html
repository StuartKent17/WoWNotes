Ghostcrawler Interview<br />
Ghostcrawler has been in Asia this week and PlayersCut (http://www.youtube.com/user/PlayersCutTV?feature=watch) was able to sit down with him for an interview (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Y00yDo-Ss).<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 is the final raid patch for Mists of Pandaria and ends with players defeating Garrosh and setting events in motion for a new warchief. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer to see who that will be. <br />
The devs aren't ready to talk about any WoW 10th anniversary events yet, but they are still working on plans for it. <br />
The team takes more of a long term view of when making changes now. They are thinking about not only the next expansion, but the one after that when they make changes.<br />
The amount of class spells has continued to rise over the years, so Mists of Pandaria made an attempt to cut down on the excess. Future expansions will make a bigger effort to do so as well.<br />
Adding additional spell effects for classes is nice, but it has to be balanced with adding even more visual noise to raid encounters. Bosses and player skills that are used less frequently will likely get the more impressive effects, rather than the filler spells used in rotations.<br />
There are a few leveling areas that need stronger guards, such as around the Dark Portal in Blasted Lands.<br />
Adding a new classes has to be done cautiously, but adding another hero class in the future is still a possibility.<br />
Monks were not a hero class because the low level story of the Wandering Isle fit them very well, but their population is still low due to having to level them up from level 1. <br />
WoW won't be going free to play anytime soon, as Blizzard is happy with the current business model. Even if they wanted to make it into a microtransaction based game, it couldn't be done with how gameplay works today. <br />
The devs want people to be able to catch up faster so that they can play with friends, which is why they are testing the experience buff (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom) and other convenience items in the Blizzard store. There is no desire to move towards a pay to win style game.<br />

FEEDBACK: Vale of Eternal Sorrows (Flexible)<br />
Creature health and damage should scale completely dynamically as people come and go, as well as mechanics interactions such as the number of puddles into which Immerseus splits. The number by your minimap should be an accurate indication of your current instance group size.<br />
<br />
For testing purposes (mostly internal convenience on our end), you can currently queue with a fairly small group, but nothing will actually scale below a 10-player size. When we release 5.4, we're intending to require a minimum of 8 players to queue. The thought there is that you might want to begin clearing the instance or at least zone in and get ready while waiting on a latecomer 9th/10th, and if we set the queue limit strictly to 10, that wouldn't be possible. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265214-feedback-vale-of-eternal-sorrows-flexible/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9561666086?page=1#16))<br />
<br />
DPS Legendary gem no longer procs for tanks<br />
One extra note: we will be buffing the Tank (Indomitable) meta gem in a future build. We'll be removing the haste scaling from its proc chance, but increasing its base chance by 50%. That should make it activate much more regularly, even for tanks who stack haste, than the previous iteration.<br />
<br />
We recognize that a lot of tanks are preferring the DPS meta gem at the moment, and we'd like to correct that, but we'd like to do it by making you like the tank gem, not by nerfing the DPS gem. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265199-dps-legendary-gem-no-longer-procs-for-tanks/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9555305441?page=4#61))<br />
<br />
Legendary Cloacks and Procs Feedback<br />
It's that easy? It doesn't take 3 months of raiding Siege of Orgrimmar to get the legendary cloak? We can get the cloaks the day 5.4 goes live??? <br />
Assuming you're all caught up on the quest, yes! You should be able to get your legendary cloak pretty quickly once Patch 5.4 hits.<br />
<br />
The reasoning is simple: we want you to be able to use it for progression. Past legendaries (including the earlier bits of the Mists of Pandaria chain) have typically taken a pretty decent amount of time before you're able to get them. That's great for heading into the next tier (or finishing up the current one), but when the next tier is in a new expansion, it can leave them feeling a little... flat. You end up using them mostly for farm, and then you replace them once the next expansion hits and you outlevel them.<br />
<br />
It also feels a little strange thematically. &quot;We need to properly gear you for the fight against the Lich King so uh... go kill the Lich King!&quot; Bit awkward, but required for gameplay purposes. A legendary doesn't feel terribly legendary if there's no effort involved in obtaining it.<br />
<br />
So, since you've been working so closely with Wrathion over the course of the expansion already, it makes sense that he'd want to equip you properly for the final resolution of the Alliance vs Horde conflict -- before you set foot in Orgrimmar. And since you've put in so much effort up til this point (starting in patch 5.0 and continuing up through patch 5.3), we don't really need to add more.<br />
<br />
We've obviously been experimenting a bit with how players earn legendaries in this expansion, so continued feedback (both on how you earn them as well as the actual legendary items themselves) is extremely valuable. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Is it possible to examine how the legendary cloak works for Hunters? Having it work as a frontal cone in front of our pets just seems to be working very wonky due to the nature of pet mechanics and AI.<br />
We actually have an alternate proc in the works for Hunters, we just weren't able to get it ready in time for this PTR push. Giving you the melee proc off of your pets was just a temporary measure.

Enhancement Tier 16 Bonus<br />
Indeed! We agree that the 5.3 Enhancement rotation isn't ideal for some AoE situations, and we're keeping a close eye on how the Enhancement Tier 16 4-piece bonus plays out. Depending on how that goes, we may either make it (or something similar) baseline, or try something else entirely.

Please don't take away dodge and parry in the next expac off gear. Please <br />
Why? What is fun about it as a stat on gear? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360766623763795969))<br />
Please take away hit/expertise, or in some way fix re-reforging every item for every upgrade!<br />
Reforge didn't work out as we hoped. Became a hassle not a bonus or convenience. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361065124494184450))<br />
Why not shift the majority of tank game play to active mitigation? Its far more fun and interesting that way (to me at least).<br />
There's a good chance we will post 5.4. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361173630878621697))<br />
<br />
Now that we're approaching the end of MoP. What class/classes do you think need a big overhaul in 6.0?<br />
None. We will likely work to make the 3 hunter and rogue specs play a little more differently from each other. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356169971937722369))<br />
Keep bomb up, use filler spell, use procs. Which mage spec am I talking about?<br />

splitting up black arrow and explosive trap cds makes sense. Still trying to understand why LnL won't proc form explosive.<br />
Explosive Trap as part of ST rotation would be annoying. That's why we added Black Arrow in the first place. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/358766785203404800))<br />

And AE healing is just too strong. Why cast 4 HL when I can just cast 1 HR and achieve roughly the same in 1/4 time?<br />
The idea is supposed to be the HR is wasted mana if it overheals. If it does not overheal, then it was the appropriate choice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361066109031559169))<br />
But it's hard to make mana not brutal in 5s and still have it be meaningful in the final raid tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361066229215150080))<br />
<br />
may I ask how you feel about ret paladins mechanically at the moment in PVE? I love how they feel right now, hoping no changes<br />
Happy with them for 5.4. Long term want to make sure they have talent choices, make AE more dynamic, and consider Inq some more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361064944319479809))<br />
<br />
is change to Illuminated Healing (once again proc'ing from periodic heals) a data mining error, or an actual change?<br />

I just feel like Blizzard doesn't know what to do with Disc Priests, PoH is still party based (inc next tweet)<br />
You guys overplay the &quot;don't know what to do with&quot; card. Disc is really well designed (and fun) IMO, just a bit too good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360765062190862336))<br />
In what way is it well designed? Two major spells very restricted, and there isn't a cap to go to, just mass go for crit...<br />
I would argue with the contentions that restricted spells are a bad thing or caps to shoot for are a good thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360767004166197249))<br />
<br />
consider random fights like h:iron qon. Spirit Shell is already hard to use there, at 10 sec will be just completely useless.<br />
Worried that Disc has felt like the premiere healer for MoP. They need some limitation somewhere... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360197579625078787))<br />
<br />
Can you please explain the intention behind decreased duration to ss? Disc seemed balanced in 25 but less so in 10s...<br />
Disc would be balanced with Atonement or good bubbles or good CDs. With all 3, they are too versatile. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/358766262869954561))<br />
Atonement is fun and we like seeing more PW:S use now than we had in 5.0, so we (gently) hit SS and Rapture. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/358766455631773696))<br />

Final tidbit: I do actually REALLY like the Warlock revamp. Why not just give one to all pure classes?<br />
I think the jury is still out on whether the excitement of the change outweighs the magnitude of the change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360772644003512321))<br />

Errr.. this whole SS-Slam AoE 2-yards thingymajig seems a little ... peculiar. Could you explain your thinking? <br />

Nope, its not. You're not using your brain are you? Monks have been out for all of 10 months. All the other classes (bar DK's) have been out for almost 10 years.<br />

Blizzard dumbs down the game as they have no choice with player base. Try recruiting from this player base, it is horrible. Most of the applicants dont know half of the spells in their own spell book and how they can be used in certain situations. Proving Grounds is further proof that they are trying to teach players how to play their class at 90 which is sad in itself, players are too lazy and want to hit 90 so fast they dont know their own class.</div></div><hr />

And what's the point of insulting players who don't excel in their class? I remember playing through vanilla as a Warrior and first of all, leveling was HARD. You had to use your whole skill set, even getting creative in the process... that made me better at the class. Nowadays, you can level 1-90 and do mostly anything with a very limited skill set (2-3-4 abilities)... Of course players won't improve as much. It's not the players fault, the game simply got over simplified and easy, and that reflects on the player base.</div></div><hr />

The plan is six months per tier. We can expect the last tier to last a little longer, but you should still be expecting 5.4 in late September and the next expansion in spring or early summer.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer to see who that will be.<br />
The devs aren't ready to talk about any WoW 10th anniversary events yet, but they are still working on plans for it.<br />
The team takes more of a long term view of when making changes now. They are thinking about not only the next expansion, but the one after that when they make changes.<br />
The amount of class spells has continued to rise over the years, so Mists of Pandaria made an attempt to cut down on the excess. Future expansions will make a bigger effort to do so as well.<br />
Adding additional spell effects for classes is nice, but it has to be balanced with adding even more visual noise to raid encounters. Bosses and player skills that are used less frequently will likely get the more impressive effects, rather than the filler spells used in rotations.<br />
There are a few leveling areas that need stronger guards, such as around the Dark Portal in Blasted Lands.<br />
Adding a new classes has to be done cautiously, but adding another hero class in the future is still a possibility.<br />
Monks were not a hero class because the low level story of the Wandering Isle fit them very well, but their population is still low due to having to level them up from level 1.<br />
WoW won't be going free to play anytime soon, as Blizzard is happy with the current business model. Even if they wanted to make it into a microtransaction based game, it couldn't be done with how gameplay works today.<br />
The devs want people to be able to catch up faster so that they can play with friends, which is why they are testing the experience buff and other convenience items in the Blizzard store. There is no desire to move towards a pay to win style game.<br />

Heart of the Aspects had -nothing- to do with the Cloud Serpents. It wasn't a teaser, it was part of the Dragon Soul raid -- hence the name 'Heart of the Aspects'. It was used to kill Deathwing. The Heart of the Aspects isn't even the same skeleton or model as Cloud Serpents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stupid? LOL. You are aware there are people who are playing characters that were created BEFORE MoP, right? That means that most of us already have one or several characters that are not monks. Giving the non-monk population a significant head start. Which is what GC meant. <br />
<br />
Always so funny to hear people proclaim others &quot;stupid&quot; when they are the ones who fail at logic.<br />

SO ghostcrawler pretty much you said &quot; suck it, we will still do Pay each Mouth, and do the in game market, AND soon we will ad a pay 1Dollar for each 1000 yards you travel or fly in wow.<br />
<br />
Reading comprehension wasn't your best subject in school, I take it?<br />
<br />
he said subscription is still going to be the main way of funding the game, with store being a complement. For which I, for one, am grateful. I wan't the subscription fee to stay, and I want the store option for tose who want to spend money on stupid helmets, rather than for them to pay gold-sellers. For honest players caring about getting a quality game, this is the best of two worlds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they are making the old 489 rep gear for justice (thus farming heroics will be effective for more than a few hours after the ding), why would they need to add 476 gear to shop? Even then, you can get 476 pvp gear by farming heriocs now, it just takes few heroics more. Making catch up mechanism with MONEY is the most retarded think I heard in a while and its nothing about catching up to friends, its about milking the shit out of their customers. hell, the whole set is probably gonna cost like 15 bucks, the entire months subscription, when you could farm all the 489 gear you wanted in a day or two. But I guess selling gear you would otherwise had to spent hours to get isnt actually selling a gear, because its not a currect raid content quality gear, right? ...</div></div><hr />

You didn't understand the point:<br />
<br />
Without Blizzard Game Store, only ingame items = equal chance for the gamers and do not matter you are rich or poor IRL.<br />
With Store: you can check people in game who has got money for stupid things and who hasn't...<br />
Shame on Blizzard devs and managers!<br />

The most important thing in MMOs is you can start from the same stage, and reach what do you want! <br />

<br />
<br />
Oh so you're saying the cloud serpent wire frame was in the game prior to heart of the aspects? Don't twist words, I never said it was part of the plot or anything of the sort. Heart of the aspects was a teaser from blizzard who finished working on the cloud serpent model in MoP and decided to modify it a bit for CURRENT content and release it for some extra money. <br />

If you honestly say the heart of the aspects mount has nothing to do with the cloud serpent model we have to today. You're wrong.</div></div><hr />

Being able to catch up easier is a great idea - nice feature to have, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Doesn't answer why they are even considering monetizing those items on top of the required $15/mo.<br />

Wich company wouldn't be happy with such business model? Pay to play + pay to win (or to get the best stuff that is not going to the game anymore like it should, like mounts) on top of that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would actually love &quot;to dumb down&quot; this stupid Feral druid priority system into something more manageable while also removing this ancient and archaic positional requirement from Shred.<br />
<br />
Not only it is stupid it is actually retarded as anyone who actually level up Feral druid up to the end game solo, cannot even learn it properly!<br />
<br />
1. .... because most mobs are dead to fast to even use Shred effectively and in proper way!<br />
2. .... Feral druid from behind opener/stun is too short to even use Shred effectively on mobs<br />
3 ..... Feral druid has only the stun opener skill/ability and not even one skill/ability to prolong the stun duration without spending the required Combo Points or in simplified form; typical play style of Feral Druid does not support to use Shred skill on any mob which is just retarded when you consider that Shred is main attack ability of Feral Druids<br />
4.... It is just frustrating to use Shred on player in PvP!<br />

<br />
What's so horrible about that? If you don't want to spend that money, don't do it. I'd gladly pay a small amount of money to shorten the leveling process, despite it being extremely fast anyway. I value my time more than the amount, but I realise that the amount will &quot;hurt&quot; more or less depending on contries and so on.<br />
As long as the normal way remains, I don't have a problem with it.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I'm not sure I'd call an item costing 7-10 (no idea what it might cost) dollars a &quot;micro&quot; transaction. I feel that the industry, and the audience, has embraced that word for every type of additional cost within games nowadays, when quite a few of them can be the size of a standalone game or expansion in some cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well... it doesn't. You're wrong. The Heart of the Aspects mount uses the same skeleton as the DragonHawks and was clearly built around them. The Cloud serpents have a completely different look, skeleton and animations.<br />
<br />
I think the issue at the time with the Heart of the Aspects mount is that everyone was assuming that it would be a reward for the &quot;Chromatic Champion&quot; achievement, which even shares the same icon. It just felt like it had been made for that achievement and then Blizzards &quot;why put a reward in the game for a challenging Achievement that requires you killing the toughest boss ingame 4 times at least, when we can just sell it to anyone&quot; thinking came in. And now you just get 10 achievement points for that achiement and a slightly retooled drake from the end boss on heroic.<br />
<br />
The Stormcrow mount looks awesome, like the Fey dragon! Perhaps they'll be quest awards from some awesome class specific questlines that are genuinely hard and actually add a challenge to the game worthy of the reward, and that hints towards the next possible expansion....<br />
<br />
....only joking, they're going to both be store mounts! LOLS Stop kidding yourselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well ... you are wrong. lol<br />
I wasn't twisting any words, the model was created for the Dragon Soul raid and released when Dragon Soul came out. If you watch the final cinematic, the thing that shoots Deathwing is the Heart of the Aspects, and just as the name suggests it was the powers of the aspects (the 4 DRAGONS) hence why the 4 aspects are now powerless and also why the Heart of the Aspects looks like a dragon. <br />
<br />
It doesn't have a damn thing to do with MoP or Cloud Serpents. It wasn't a teaser. Any person with eyes can clearly see that the models look nothing alike, animations aren't even similar, the skeletons are completely different, the textures are not the same. Unless you think serpent-dragon = MOP SPOILER then there's no other similarity between the mounts.</div></div><hr />
