Today we are getting a look at some of the art for Garrisons (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/279171-warlords-of-draenor-take-charge-of-your-garrison/). <br />
Greetings, and welcome to another edition of Artcraft! I’m Chris Robinson, senior art director of World of Warcraft, and for this second entry I’ve gathered a group of Warlords of Draenor developers to talk a bit about Garrisons—specifically, how our artists are working closely with the game designers to ensure that the visuals we’re crafting support their design goals.<br />
<br />
We’re not really going to get into the details of how Garrisons work here, like specific mechanics of their design. Think of this more as a behind-the-scenes glimpse into our art process with two of our groups: our dungeon art team, which is responsible for all the Garrison's large buildings, walls, gates, and so on; and our prop art team, which is focused on the profession buildings and all of the awesome details you’ll find inside of them.<br />
<br />
Gameplay First<br />
Before we get to that, first we'd like to talk about a few aspects of the art team's relationship with the game designers. We’ve asked Lead Content Designer Cory Stockton to talk a little about how the Garrison works, and how design and art come together to get something as massive as Garrisons into the game. Here’s Cory:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Everyone! The Garrison feature is going to be a huge part of your core experience in Warlords of Draenor, so it’s really exciting to get a chance to talk about it. As Chris mentioned, it's a massive feature with a lot of different moving parts, one of the biggest of which is the visuals—and that’s where our art team comes in. We knew we wanted the Garrison to feel like a big new feature, but we also wanted to keep it familiar, like bringing a piece of home to Draenor. There is just something about running into Stormwind or Orgrimmar that evokes that sense of faction pride, and that’s exactly what we wanted out of the Garrison. The art team was able to work with us to deliver brand new art that still evokes those feelings from our faction capitals.<br />
<br />
Nailing the look is just one part of the process though. A big part of the feature is being able to increase your Garrison’s power over time, and we wanted to make sure you see that reflected in the art. This means that all of the Garrison buildings have to have multiple, and increasingly epic visual upgrades. The plot system used for Garrisons—which allows you to customize your layout and place buildings anywhere—presented a unique challenge for the art team, since even though a building needs to look more epic at each upgrade, it couldn’t actually change shape at the base. Check out some of the under-development examples below.<br />

<br />
The Dungeon Team: Making Old Look New... or Is It New Look Old?<br />
Hi there, I'm Wendy Vetter, lead artist for the World of Warcraft dungeon team, and next I'm going to give you an inside look at how we’re bringing the Garrison buildings into the world.<br />
<br />
When working on the Garrison, we decided to start with the Alliance buildings first, and that’s what we’ll be focusing on today. When we first began, we thought, &quot;Wouldn’t it be cool for players to get to have some of the original buildings from back in Elwynn and Redridge in their Garrison? Our resident Concept Wizard (actual title) Jimmy Lo ran with this idea of a “trip down memory lane” by bringing back a lot of those early buildings, and we worked on trying to keep a lot of familiar parts of the buildings intact while updating themwith new textures.<br />
<br />
After trying that idea out, we began to notice the buildings were looking too familiar—it wasn't epic enough, and wasn't looking like something you’d expect to see in this big new feature. So we updated the recipe to &quot;extra-crispy&quot;—and that meant going far beyond a new coat of paint on an old asset.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We didn't, however, ignore the past—we built upon it. Keeping the original spirit of the old buildings, we began exploring new designs. We created fresh silhouettes and pushed the individuality of each building, creating visually exciting upgrades as you progressed. This way, when you get that first shack you call a Lumber Mill—an oversized crate with some sticks and a dull saw in it—you're excited, but you know there's lots of room for improvement. As you build your army and finally get that third-tier Lumber Mill though, you feel like a badass ready to fight back against the Iron Horde.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have to say I love, love—did I mention LOVE?—the Mage Tower. The library invites the player to grab their favorite book of spells (mine is Beatrice’s Magical Exploits Into the Wilds of Wildervar), wrap up in a blanket, plop on a nice soft chair with their favorite pet sitting on their lap, and read till the light of the fire dims to crackling embers. When we’re creating the art, we actually use small stories like that as a way to guide the scene. We use lighting, material choices, silhouettes, and carefully crafted details to invite the imagination of the player to look beyond the pixels and textures, and bring their character into the world. I like to think of the buildings as characters themselves, each with a personality, from the little nicks on a doorway, to the warm hearth in the Town Hall.<br />
<br />
We hope you feel right at home when you step into each of these places.<br />

<br />
The Prop Team: Showing a Story<br />
I’m Eric Browning, the lead prop artist on WoW, and my team is responsible for props, FX, and initial set decoration. For the Garrison, we’ve put more emphasis on the “set decoration” aspect than ever before, giving us a much better sense of how well a particular kit is working right from the start. I’ll let the three of the artists working on them explain a bit more.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/thumb/garr09.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/garr09.jpg) <br />
<br />
“One of the most powerful aspects of an artist’s mission is storytelling, and working to fill the space in the Garrison has allowed us to really focus in on that. Decorating a particular set or building provides an opportunity to communicate a lot of information about how the space is used and how it was made, and all the pieces come together to help convey an overarching theme. Little nuances and details in the props can help give the player context into what’s happening in a particular area of the game, and ultimately, really help to tell the story of an entire zone.<br />
<br />
We approach each of these tasks on both micro and macro levels—evaluating how each smaller piece comes together as a larger whole. This is where the real challenge lies, since we don’t want to visually overwhelm the player—but at the same time, we're giving everyone the visually striking, high-quality level of art they've come to expect from World of Warcraft.”<br />

<br />
“In Warlords of Draenor, your Garrison is your fortress—a foothold in a savage world, and ultimately a place to call your own. One of our main goals with the Garrison was to really bring some life and sense of purpose to the characters who inhabit the world, and to make them feel like they belong in their environment. What that entails for us as artists is to brainstorm, develop, and refine a scenario that not only gives a narrative to a particular space, but helps make the player feel like the world is cohesive and real. We strive to give each set of props—what we call a 'kit'—logical treatment and placement so that the NPCs look as if they truly belong there. In doing so, it hopefully allows for a more visually rich and rewarding journey for the player.”<br />

<br />
“For the profession hubs, we wanted the player to be able to experience leveling up their chosen professions not only with skill points, but also visually through their Garrison. As the player progresses, each profession hub will level up, and the associated building will become more visually impressive. We treated each profession hub as an opportunity to describe the NPC who works there—how neat or messy they are, how they might work, and how they’ll grow with you as you level up your Garrison. We also thought it would be fun to throw in small hints of different races that might be associated with certain professions, such as draenei for Jewelcrafting or dwarves for Blacksmithing, to tie in the many races that give the World of Warcraft its depth and history.“<br />

One More Thing<br />
Hey there—Chris here again, and I hope you’ve enjoyed this closer look at the buildings for your Garrison. While we focused on Alliance Garrison this time around, we’re definitely making a lot of great progress on the Horde counterpart, and look forward to giving you a more in-depth preview in a future episode of Artcraft. In the meantime, here’s a sneak peek at what you can expect. See you soon!<br />

<br />
<br />
I don't understand why, and I don't think it's a good move at all. I would much, much rather have a single race specific house for my character, than a huge garrison with 340980248 buildings that all look the same, racially, and don't fit my character.<br />
<br />
Just give me a blood elf house for my blood elf, a gnome house for my gnome, and a tauren house for my tauren. I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me neither ;) but I thought Blizzard saw it like that, as WoW's way of doing housing. I sure hope it's not, and that WoW will get actual housing at some point along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. It is not meant to be a super customizable personal space, nor it is really player housing. You will get some customization with the individual buildings as well as where in your garrison they are placed. But it is as close to player housing as Blizzard is likely to do, seeing as it is something that has been requested for 10 years and Garrisons are the closest we've gotten.</div></div><hr />

I love how they had the nerve to go like, oh we will have small throwbacks to other races at profession areas. Really? A hammer logo and a mug of beer wont make my stormwind flag flying, blue roofed smithy feel dwarven. If my charcater went to this world to build a stronghold he would make it out of solid stone and in the earth like a proper dwarf. While I am still looking forward to this and think it looks great...I am still disappointed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No they said the NPC inside the profession building you talk to will be different not inspired by it. Oh hey its a dwarf in a blacksmith dats cool or a draenai playing with gems how nice. No mention of race buildings or special features outside of that.<br />
<br />
We also thought it would be fun to throw in small hints of different races that might be associated with certain professions, such as draenei for Jewelcrafting or dwarves for Blacksmithing, to tie in the many races that give the World of Warcraft its depth and history.“<br />
<br />
So basically if you have an enchanting profession building you might see a blood elf if you are horde.</div></div><hr />

ah yes.. wildstar, the game that doesn´t have a release date and is still under complete NDA. Obviously that game is much much better because it is all in your imagination.<br />
<br />
I remember when people were saying the combat system in AOC would kill WOW.. or Warhammer, or Star Wars.. blah blah ... people are silly to get excited about a game that isn´t going to be released for at least 6 months and has a complete NDA in place so that nobody can even talk about anything in the game.

<br />
What does the Wildstar housing do? I'm seriously asking, I don't know a thing about that game.<br />
<br />
On topic. The art is solid but it's hard to get excited since we still have only the same vague descriptions of what Garrisons actually provide. I appreciate the angle of &quot;Gameplay first&quot; but that's a tough sell when they have yet to talk about garrison gameplay beyond what little information we got at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
And I also have to say that I don't see my character hanging around in a Mage Tower or most of these buildings. Since this expansion is something of a throwback I can understand the Orcs and Humans feel of the buildings. I do wish there was a bit more visual variety though. Especially since some of the races have some really cool architecture concepts that I'd love to see updated to the degree that the human buildings have been for this.</div></div><hr />

The reason it is ´perfect´ is because it is all ideas and things in your head... just like AOC, Warhammer, SW and all the other failed games were great... right up until they launched.<br />

<br />
Phased. But I think you may be able to invite party member in?<br />
<br />
The level of details looks better than just about anything else in WoW, which is good. But the decision to just do humans and orcs (fucking shocker, I know) really makes this ring hollow for me.</div></div><hr />

Those hints can be some of the other races' stuff, as in decoration and not just NPCs. I don't think it'll be major or many hints, and that's boring. But I'm surprised at how good those buildings look!</div></div><hr />

I'm racking my brain over this. How would they go about giving the Forsaken a nod? I would say alchemy but don't the Goblins have Alchemy as their racial boost? Then again, Goblin was an engineering spec, so you may see the Forsaken get an Alchemy lab.</div></div><hr />

have you ever tried to fully render, illustrate and animate a three dimensional model of something, in detail? Think about that times the number of buildings needed for each race. As much as I would like race specific buildings, I'm happy to get the profession based nods to the races. (I wonder if that means we're all doomed to Panda kitchens on both sides?)</div></div><hr />

You're crying over negative feedback on a discussion forum and I've seen you do it in almost every news thread that has people disliking something. Like someone is saying your child is ugly and you get all defensive and bring out words like &quot;cry&quot; and &quot;whine&quot; when that is hypocritically what you are doing. (And now so am I by doing it back to you, it never ends) It's a discussion thread, some people will like stuff, some won't. Deal with it.<br />

To all those people out there that do not like: This isn't costing a raid tier. You misread. It would cost a raid gear if they were to make this feature look different for every race.<br />
Let's say there's 20 buildings. Each has three versions for the upgrades. And a Horde and Alliance variant. That means 120 buildings for Blizzard to make.<br />
<br />
Now that takes a lot of time and effort. Now imagine having do to this for every race. That's 120 x 13 = 1560 buildings. I say, let them just make these 120 ones great.</div></div><hr />

It might help to look at this as a baby step. I'd love the idea of race themed buildings too (I too have a bevy of non-spiky belfs :D), but ... maybe next expansion? You have to admit that the garrison design is waaaaay beyond what we have now with our farms in Halfhill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
absolutely fair to compare a game in development with the engine that is build with housing in mind (let alone the flexibility they have by not being yet fully released) with one of 10 years ago for which the engine was thought to last probably no longer than 5 years, and for which introducing a feature like this is probably 10 times the amount of work just in coding cause you have to work within the existing boundaries (aka introducing it without destroying the rest)<br />
<br />
The housing in Wildstar will probably be amazing. Props to them, I'd say, and I will be totally trying the game cause it looks interesting<br />
However, if we can stop with the silly comparisons and instead judge things on their own merits, that would be great</div></div><hr />

I figure it had to be something like that. (Because using Saronite would have been an obviously bad idea.) I'm talking in terms of time periods. This architecture takes place after all the &quot;we need to invest in this saronite stuff&quot; of Wrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same thing with the new character models. One or two have animations and the rest seem to be at the stage of concept art. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has always worked slowly. And now they have a lot more games they are working on than ever before. I think players are delusional if they believe WoD will release anytime before the Holiday season of this year. And I wouldn't be surprised to see it push off into 2015.</div></div><hr />

guess when i'm bored of raiding and really bad pvp i can do this besides grinding reputations. at least they're moving away from the daily grind. They should enhance professions by allowing some kind of cross profession interaction. if you have across your account per faction a certain amount of professions maxed out you should be able to make new things via your garrison and then keep or sell them.<br />
<br />
i see it as a first step in a step towards more of a sandbox feel. which is good imo.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they've even said it's intended as a WoD feature, not longterm, just like how the tillers farm played out. Bit disappointing since the brunt of Blizzcon was spent talking about them and not a whole lot else in terms of new features.<br />

To be fair, i'd like to know how you and others, from what was shown to us at BlizzCon, what at all made you think, expect or even hope for race themed buildings? <br />
<br />
I always got the impression from what they said about Garrisons that it would only be humans/orc themes due to the fact they said that Garrisons would act as a stronghold of sorts; with improvements over time as your campaign against the Iron horde went on and the base became more established, with it acting as a sort of base of operations if you will, similar to Valiance Keep/Warsong Hold in Borean Tundra and Highbank/Dragonmaw Port in Twilight Highlands, except that instead of being controlled by a random NPC, it's controlled by the player and actually changes visually over time rather than staying the same which already is a significant improvement imo. This therefore made me think the themes would only be faction based because bases that have served a similar purpose in the past have usually been human/orc themed, Highbank for example is human architecture even though its leader is a dwarf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
God i hope so. I hate that this &quot;feature&quot; is going to be required as part of the gameplay. It should be an optional way to play the game, much like pet battles and BGs are. I have had 0 interest in a player housing feature, and i dislike the idea of this one just as much.<br />

I've always thought another NPC like Thrall was actually founding the town, starting its construction, and then handing control over to me as the player...so architecture aside, the town is mine, i can control what buildings go where, BUT since I'm not the &quot;Peon&quot; actually building things, just providing the materials to do so, the buildings wouldn't have my racial touch to them.</div></div><hr />

The devs have stated over and over that they don't like the idea of creating basically a room for people to hide in. Garrisons are their attempt to make the idea fit into WoW, and I think it's looking pretty good so far. We don't have all the details, so people need to chill out a bit before criticizing it. Personally I'm glad they aimed for the huge scale rather than giving people a little apartment. I also hope they can make garrisons either a personal retreat or a social hub depending on what people feel like doing, meaning that the concept is flexible enough to encompass both.</div></div><hr />

If the Garrison become a concurrent feature on the game they might implement new Garrison race traits depending on race of course as a micro-transaction offer.</div></div><hr />

I'd love Nelf buildings, but, I'd rather they got Garrisons done, which is a massive feature really, make sure its balanced and working, then bring racial updates later, it really isn't &quot;needed&quot;, would you rather wait 6 more months whilst they create 400 more buildings?<br />

I honestly don't even know how people can complain, this wasn't even a player requested feature, sure housing was, but this is housing x 100000, so it's practically a bonus, be happy we are getting something new and shiny, and pretty damn big and in-depth when you look into it.<br />

makes much more sense if you think about it as your factions outpost and you being a castellan or something (with way too many personal benefits but whatever).<br />
<br />
this a weird feature in general tbh. it's like they wanted to have housing, but without houses so they went for warcraft 3 bases look and advertise it as 'your personal fortress'.<br />
<br />
i like it though, will be fun to mess around with and as much as i hate humans i actually like their architecture. ;p<br />

<br />
Agreed. I'm an Alliance player, so this feature seems to work better for us than the Horde. The only races we have that feel slightly out of place with this artwork are the Elves and Draenei...and even they work pretty well within this tile set. Human art is just kinda nice, pretty, and unoffensive.<br />
<br />
On the Horde side though, really just the Orcs feel at home with that image they teased. Undead, Trolls, Tauren, Blood Elves, Goblins...they all have wildly different designs they belong to. Hard to picture a Blood Elf character customizing his Garrison full of Orc artwork. All of the Horde stuff is far more personal to the races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Therefor I'd also like to quote what they've said: <br />
<br />
''... even though a building needs to look more epic at each upgrade, it couldn’t actually change shape at the base.''<br />
<br />
Then why is the base totally different compared between Mage Towers Tier 1 and 2?<br />
<br />
I'd bet the answer would be:<br />
<br />
''Because Tier 1 is a tent and Tier 2 is a permanent structure.''<br />
<br />
I'd rather have a sloppy Mage building of which you can recognize the base in the next Tiers than the tent they've currently planned for it.<br />

He didn't say it was a lie. He just feels that it's an overhyped feature. I saw the video and it's impressive stuff. As a player who's never experienced housing in my MMO history, it's a refreshing and if done correctly, sweeet idea. However, doesn't mean Wildstar is the end all be all as you seem to flaunt around. By all means you're entitled to your opinion and you make some valid points, but you lose credit when you seem to stick your hand in every WoW related news only to bash it and promote the next &quot;WoW Killier™&quot;.<br />

I would of loved Tauren Buildings for my Garrison, But sometimes you just learn Art is huge part of MMOs &amp; sometimes you only have so many Artists on hand &amp; when trying to make things right you take your time &amp; not rush it. Plus you got other things you gotta make so it comes at the cost of being human &amp; only have so much man power to do things.<br />
<br />
But aslong as they atleast give some look of Racial presence in the Garrison I'm happy.</div></div><hr />

OH GOD, please we already have 12 forum topics+ about this.<br />
<br />
NO you cant hire more and more folks to work on the same thing. You have no point of reference over whether they're being lazy or not. and judging by all the work being done. THey're NOT.<br />
<br />
You cannot throw more people at something and just expect more stuff to be done. WE already have 12 topics about this full of WHY this is so and iam not going to repeat myself over and over lie everyone else. <br />
<br />
making something fresh is easier than building ontop of something. plainly because you are constnatly working to maintain what you have ontop of the new content. and all your new content is based on the engine and what you already have. You can only build around it and building something new for it take enormous effort and time where resources are scant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this isn't something your race is building. This is a Military Garrison that you are overseeing for your factions military, your MAIN faction, not the one based on your race. So all Alliance characters will build Human (since that is the MAIN faction theme for Alliance) buildings and the Horde will build Orc (even though they are now run by Trolls).<br />
<br />
I think this is still evident of people confusing or hoping this is a &quot;player housing&quot;, which it is not. This is you establishing a military outpost for your Faction, not you building your retirement villa. Besides, you have to remember, this is the first round of implementation for this feature. How many patches will we have throughout WoD? Probably enough to add a few things to Garrisons and make them a bit more &quot;race flavored&quot; down the road, much like the Professions buildings are going to have &quot;hints&quot; of the races that have ties to said professions (Draenai and JC, Dwarfs and BS, Blood Elfs and Enchanting, etc).</div></div><hr />

Oh boy I do have references....Wildstar housing and LOTR online housing are better than this and the first is a mmo still under development and the second one is a &quot;minor&quot; mmo if you compare it with WoW. If those ppl can do it...why not Blizz? If the problem is about the races require &quot;too much work&quot; then...why you did introduce them in first place? Why building cities and creating an art behind it. This argument is shit. There's plenty of players than are not Human or Orc and, therefore, they don't want to play on a human/orc base...like it or not. So please, don't tell me that is not necessary or that there's no references of better housing. Blizz can afford to pay 20 or 40 or even the 200 ppl that some of you said or whatever it needs to build them up....we're talking about a game that has almost 8 million ppl paying to play it. So yeah, I do believe that either they're lazy or either they're not investing enough resources on this because they just don't give a fuck.</div></div><hr />

This is a Military Garrison that you are overseeing for your factions military, your MAIN faction, not the one based on your race. So all Alliance characters will build Human (since that is the MAIN faction theme for Alliance) buildings and the Horde will build Orc (even though they are now run by Trolls).<br />
<br />
I think this is still evident of people confusing or hoping this is a &quot;player housing&quot;, which it is not. This is you establishing a military outpost for your Faction, not you building your retirement villa. Besides, you have to remember, this is the first round of implementation for this feature. How many patches will we have throughout WoD? Probably enough to add a few things to Garrisons and make them a bit more &quot;race flavored&quot; down the road, much like the Professions buildings are going to have &quot;hints&quot; of the races that have ties to said professions (Draenai and JC, Dwarfs and BS, Blood Elfs and Enchanting, etc).<br />
<br />
THIS. Exactly. You people need to get this. Its not your house. You'll never have your own house to furnish as you please. They were cristal clear about this ages ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is NOT PLAYER HOUSING. Your comparison is fail. Your comprehensions of &quot;WoW Garrions&quot; is fail.<br />
<br />
Once you understand that this is not your own private house, then you will realize that you can't compare it to &quot;player housing&quot;. So until you can find a game that has Garrions in them, that are similar to what WoW is currently developing, you need to stop posting. <br />
<br />
Also, do you know how Blizzard finances work? Do you have inside knowledge on how they spend their resources to develop their game? If not, you should also stop posting about how Blizzard can &quot;afford&quot; to hire more people to develop this or any feature for this game.</div></div><hr />

He just feels that it's an overhyped feature. I saw the video and it's impressive stuff. As a player who's never experienced housing in my MMO history, it's a refreshing and if done correctly, sweeet idea. However, doesn't mean Wildstar is the end all be all as you seem to flaunt around. By all means you're entitled to your opinion and you make some valid points, but you lose credit when you seem to stick your hand in every WoW related news only to bash it and promote the next &quot;WoW Killier™&quot;.<br />
<br />
I in no way think it's a wow killer. I would prefer if Blizzard would not half ass a feature and actually make it more like Wildstar. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you have nothing good to say, then don't say anything. Either way, thanks for the video, interesting stuff.<br />
<br />
You're thinking of the battlenet forums where they ban you if you speak out about the game. Here the mods are nicer and allow you to say your opinion even when it's negative. If you don't like what I have to say and it causes you pain might I suggest taking advantage of the ignore feature. You can ignore everyone who says a negative thing about the game you like and the forum will become a WoW utopia where the only posts you see are people praising everything. Today you make the first step.</div></div><hr />

It's about doing a decent housing according to the number of races that the game has. Some of you said that &quot;ok, is not your house...you're just in charge to build a fortress for your faction&quot; Well, if that's the case, then as dwarf I'll build a fortress in the way that I think is more familiar, common, effective and easy for me and, most probably, it will end up looking with some Ironforge art. I think that way will be similar for the other races. <br />

Some of you are happy with just an human/orc camp which is ok but not everyone thinks the same way for sure and, so far, I didn't get any STRONG argument from blizzard in order to explain why not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imo - that would look ridiculous. Uniformity is key, especially in military garrisons. They aren't going for style. IF they ever make them more racially based, i would expect you choose the race or it's based on your current race and all the buildings fit. I couldn't see them mixing it up like you have suggested. <br />
<br />
At this point, they are going for simplicity to get it implemented and working right. I think we can all safely assume that they will at a later date add cosmetic changes to the Garrison feature, but for now they just want them working and fully functional. Someone previously posted a form of &quot;transmog&quot; for your Garrison, which i think would be a good way to personalize them later if Blizzard decided that was worth doing. However, again, you have to understand this is a MILITARY garrison, not a personal keep for you and the rest of the players to decorate. <br />
<br />
Think of it this way, it's your own personal &quot;Honor Hold&quot;/&quot;Thrallmar&quot; you are in charge of and is still under the construction umbrella of Stormwind/Orgrimmar depending on your main faction. Kinda looks to me like Blizzard is trying to give us and our characters a more &quot;Hero&quot; feel by putting us in charge of a military outpost and making decisions for said outpost, they give us a blueprint, we put it together.</div></div><hr />

Ok, maybe there are 10x the number of polys in those objects now, and you have to maintain a consistent art style that matches the design of the game, but sheesh, the same flag, the same color blue, the same color red. You guys all just sit around drinking and then spend an hour or so a day cutting and pasting art assets that were developed a decade ago right? &quot;Here, we should have a wall around the garrison, I'll just grab, oh, Menethil Harbor say and make a few... hey it looks good as it is!

Then what exactly garrisons are? And don't say 'representation of your faction on Draenor'. Lets look at it for what it really is - A building, a patch of land, phased content where you have limited customization, limited options which will more then likely be obsolete pretty soon. Basically, a worse version of housing. I don't care for it much, WoD is looking more and more like a major content patch, but I will buy since I like raiding, but it seems this will be yet another expansion where I'll log just for raids.<br />
<br />
Also the 'it's tough to hire artists' argument. A lot smaller studios manage to either pump out content like crazy or just beat Blizzard in certain areas (like this player housing feature). They also carefully pick their developers and yet their art isn't a major clusterfuck of 23423 different art directions, like Blizzard insinuates what would happen if they hire more. Seems everybody manages to do that except Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I really hope they are planning some great features with patches because this looks pretty underwhelming. But to each his own. If somebody was to ask me what are the major changes/selling points in WoD I would not be able to tell them. Garrisons/Item Squish/Bigger bags?</div></div><hr />

I really can't get into this if they won't allow other races to be represented in the architecture. I have lots of characters, and coincidentally none of them are orcs or humans. So I guess I'm screwed? My Tauren shaman wants giant totems and proper Tauren themed-buildings. My blood elf hunter wants the flag of Silvermoon emblazoned on his buildings. My forsaken priest wants the iconic forsaken architecture, not wooden spikes. I'm tired of Orgrimmar. I'm sick of looking at it.

<br />
If the Garrison become a concurrent feature on the game they might implement new Garrison race traits depending on race of course as a micro-transaction offer.<br />
<br />
I pretty much agree, if it works out i think they will this continue on, i could see a &quot;town in a box&quot; type item to move your garrison to a new location in the new xpac. Also if it works out i could see a dedicated team stood up to handle art for other races vs using the dungeon team. This of course is assuming blizzard finds more artist that meet their standards for employment. <br />

I don't think they will sell the other races in the store though.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but I feel like that's because they gated such awesome rewards behind completing them. People will only recruit you if you have 555555 ilvl even though it scales you down anyway, and it has to be the right class combo, and you have to have experience, because everybody wants their special class transmog set but it's simply too challenging for everyone to enjoy. Or maybe not. I don't know. I downloaded oqueue in hopes of finding a group for them on my lock at some point but I never can. To increase the popularity you have to have low risk. You can't have high risk and high reward because it will frighten people away or become discouraging. I was excited about them as well, especially the cosmetic gear sets, and the idea of more cosmetic gear sets being added, but it was too discouraging when I realized that even though I geared up my warlock within the first month the expansion was out and raced to max level so I wouldn't get behind.. I still couldn't do them because people were too afraid or they were too challenging at the time. Now the only ones I see with the sets are the ones in raiding guilds with 565 ilvl or higher. It was just a failed premise and would have been better if they had offered stat upgrade gear closer to raiding level than gate unique artwork gear behind it that nobody will get to enjoy and in the end will be wasted. <br />
<br />
And scenarios are just not popular because they're fast, boring, and don't have a high reward. The heroics with valor are really the only decent things, and even a lot of them I've had people turn me down for not having at least a 530 ilvl.. even though the ones that acted like it was low and had 20 ilvl higher died from standing in crap. <br />
<br />
The whole illvl system just brought this game to a terrible level in my opinion. It adds convenience in some areas, but I kind of miss the days of having people armory me or check me out in stormwind without dismissing me because I don't have a certain number met.<br />

On a sidenote, look at that awesome library. If only there was an undead mage in the middle, a few readable books on the floor, and a chest with a key. And that flat copy pasted texture of Book-like wallpaper strung on the walls that you can't interact with! Pretty amazing if you ask me!</div></div><hr />

So to raid I need to be on Horde and I hate the Horde (orc mainly) building aesthetics, I don't want spiky buildings I want something more like the alliance ones. I prefer Stormwind over Orgrimmar and I feel this will be the same with garrisons. Not a big deal, but I wish I could choose how my garrison looked, perhaps an array of neutral buildings to choose from instead of predefined faction ones. If the garrisons turn out to be fun this won't bother me so much but one can still dream.</div></div><hr />

Sarcasm? If not that's probably a bad example, but also if not another example would be the tent from icc tournaments. The mage tower. It's just very underwhelming for an already underwhelming feature, that is the sole feature of Warlords. And by that statement I'm intentionally not including character models as they are not part of the expansion but timed with the release of the expansion and obtainable with or without purchase of the expansion. :)<br />
<br />
Garrisons, zones, level cap raised, and a few minor questing changes with expected max level end game content added on are really all it's got. If Garrisons don't seem any better functionally than this, I'm afraid we're going to have another scenario/challenge mode/farm situation on our hands. Pet battles even, but I think there is still an odd demand for those amongst a select few for some reason. I'm not sure how you can tolerate the boring interface and additional grind of pet battles and leveling, but to each his own.</div></div><hr />

Actually, its your own garrison... except it isn't... except is it... Blizz is being very dubious about how they promote this.

I believe they said earlier you can have multiple profession buildings, and have even said you'll thusly be able to have limited access to professions your character doesn't even have.<br />
<br />
They haven't given any details of what you can do with &quot;other&quot; profession buildings. <br />
<br />
I hope you're right that I can get a &quot;dissenchanting&quot; station. Though I'm worried they might limit it to X-number-of-times-a-day/week, or &quot;Can only dissenchant green items&quot; or some such nonsense.</div></div><hr />

I remember when people were saying the combat system in AOC would kill WOW.. or Warhammer, or Star Wars.. blah blah ... people are silly to get excited about a game that isn´t going to be released for at least 6 months and has a complete NDA in place so that nobody can even talk about anything in the game. The reason it is ´perfect´ is because it is all ideas and things in your head... just like AOC, Warhammer, SW and all the other failed games were great... right up until they launched.<br />

<br />
The problem with WoW is that even when they try to do something outside the box, they do it in a clunky way. I might love the concept they are working with for Garrisons, but maybe when they translate to the actual game it feels really bad, simply because those 9 years that the game has can't manage certaing things in a proper way or because they do it simply wrong (a different problem, but they need to be more in touch with us, the players).</div></div><hr />

Also, Housing is something People wanted, and instead of just a House they give the Players a complete Outpost in which they can customize what they want to build. That´s nice.<br />
They are updating the PC Models, wich was wanted for a long Time now, and I think that is awesome.<br />
<br />
The Story of WoD seems weird to me. It feels like they are trying to make this Thing a big Pile of Fanservice, and that could be nice, but flopped mostly with MoP, so lets hope it works out better this Time. <br />
I have to admit, I dropped out of the Game with the Beginning of Cata, played till 85, tested the first Raid, and that was it. I came back with MoP, leveld to 90 and dropped out pretty bored.<br />
I WILL come back with WoD, and it seems like I could stay for a While this Time.<br />
Why? Well...<br />
<br />
There are some Reasons for that.<br />
The Numbers Squish. The &quot;Button&quot; Squish. The Return to Outland, seeing some of my all Time Favorite Characters again, like Grom, maybe (just maybe) Brox, and the Outlands themselves in a new Way. I think this X Pac is for People like me. Old Day Warcraft and Vanilla/BC Veterans, People that love the Lore and the Warcraft Universe and some of the Characters and Places in it. People that want to get lost in the World, and not just run for the Endgame to repeat Bits of Content until they get bored of it.<br />
I am looking forward to this &quot;What If...&quot; Storyline, and I think some others are thinking just like me. I am not an Elitist Tryhard that needs to have the highest Gear, also, I don´t think I am that skilled of a Player. My Time is limited, I have a Job and whatnot, so I can only sink so much of my Spare Time into a Game, and I want that Time to be filled with Quality Content. I got that from WoW, until the Colloseum Patch in Wrath, that was the Point in Time for me where the Game started to go the Way of the Dodo. Weeks and Weeks of Progress Raiding in Ulduar, and then this Patch happened. It killed the Game for me, my Motivation to raid. I came back for the LK and had a good Time raiding there though. For Cata I had high Hopes, really. And seeing Azeroth in new Way was great, until I dinged 85. Same with MoP, nothing new, only a new Coat of Paint over the old washed out Car. <br />
Maybe this Time we are in for a positive Surprise.<br />
Don´t be so negative about everything.</div></div><hr />

I expected the old 'white brick with blue ceilings' Stormwind motif that I felt was too Human, but these ones are much more neutral-looking and acceptable for the other races. I especially like the wooden theme and all the buildings kind of bring a very relaxing and warm feeling, much like a summer retreat house in the woods.<br />

The graphical update is stunning and I really do love how the Jewel crafting building looks like a mix of Human/Night Elf/Draenei architecture or whatever. It really does look gorgeous. And I know I have nothing but one picture to base it off right now but if that 'sneak peek' of the Horde Stables is anything to go by what the other buildings are going to look like for the garrison, I'm going to be a bit dissapointed. :( I hope they do what they've done with the Alliance buildings where they're not 'IN YOUR FACE' Human architecture and they add some hints of Blood Elf, Tauren and other races from the Horde into the buildings and they capture the aesthetic variety to make every player of every race feel at home. because I feel like those stables are pretty much 'IN YOUR FACE' full Orc style.</div></div><hr />

Uniformity is key, especially in military garrisons. They aren't going for style. IF they ever make them more racially based, i would expect you choose the race or it's based on your current race and all the buildings fit. I couldn't see them mixing it up like you have suggested. <br />
<br />
Except the Alliance and Horde used race specific art from the start. You can always clearly see what race created what outpost. <br />
<br />
Forsaken outpost:<br />
http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/97550.jpg<br />
Night elf outpost:<br />
http://wow.gamona.de/wp-content/gallery/geschichte/grenze_ashenvale_silberschwingen_aussenposten.jpg<br />
<br />
So why should Garrisons now only be human and orc style? It makes no sense except the usual time/money problem. But from in-game lore view it makes no sense to have gnomes operate gigantic machines where they can't even reach the levers.<br />
<br />
I think they should add one building from each faction in the outpost, representing one profession.<br />
<br />
Human/Undead = Alchemy<br />
Dwarf/Orc = Blacksmithing<br />
Night elf/Tauren = Enchanting<br />
Pandaren = Inscription<br />
Gnome/Goblin = Engineering<br />
Draenei/Blood elf = Jewelcrafting<br />
Worgen/Troll = Leatherworking</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having only one look for each faction is a bit of a shocker and nothing to be proud of. The models look good but in the end buildings are easy todo, especially the &quot;lowpoly&quot; stuff in WoW and you dont have to rig, animate etc.<br />
I'm surprised a creative and huge team like Blizzard can't come up with a better solution than having every single horde player walk around in his little instanced orc village but I will probably racechange into orc anyways.</div></div><hr />

Have you paid any attention to the level of detail they're putting in the buildings?? They are the farthest thing from &quot;half-assing&quot;<br />
It takes them a ton of time and effort just to do them, because they are starting everything from scratch.</div></div><hr />
