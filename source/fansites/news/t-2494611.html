Mike Morhaime Interviews - Project Titan and Starcraft Ghost<br />
Mike Morhaime, co-founder and former President of Blizzard Entertainment, has been discussing his time at Blizzard in a series of recent interviews (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2494031-Crossroads-Cinematic-Essence-VFX-Mike-Morhaime-Interviews). Most recently, he talked with VG247 (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/26/world-warcraft-sequel-titan-canned-blizzard-failed-control-scope/) about the canceled MMO project, code-named Titan. <br />
<br />
<br />
Titan was canceled because Blizzard failed to control the scope of the project. <br />
They looked at Titan as a sequel to World of Warcraft, a next-generation MMO. <br />
Many of their senior developers were put on project Titan. <br />
The game was very ambitious taking place in a universe focused on hystorical myth, with time travel mechanics. <br />
Titan would have been a subscription-based MMO had it been released. <br />
The engine for the game never reached the level of where it needed to be, and the developer staff said it wasn't working.<br />
They asked the team to come up with one or two ideas they could focus on, it could be anything they wanted. <br />
Overwatch was the result of the Titan team's brainstorming and became the focus of their team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mike Morhaime also discussed the cancellation of Starcraft Ghost (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/27/starcraft-ghost-cancelled-blizzard-game-co-founder-mike-morhaime-regrets/), what would have been a 3rd person action game set in the Starcraft universe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard felt Starcraft Ghost couldn't be successful because of limited resources. <br />
During Starcraft Ghost development, World of Warcraft was exploding while Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2 were in development.<br />
The team had to make tough choices on where to place its talent, and there weren't enough resources to go around. <br />
With Starcraft Ghost canceled, they could focus on injecting all their talent into other products.<br />

I killed Rustfeather four times before getting it. I'd say it's definitely worth it. It's the only thing from Pascal that's definitely worth it (Mechacat as well, for mount collectors). Also, 200 spare parts isn't much, it isn't even a single SPARE crate.</div></div><hr />

It's worth it. One craft creates 3 Jetpacks that last 20 minutes each. You will get those spare parts and then some back before running out of all 3 charges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know that. However that seems to be only every other day. So the days without a jetpack suck. It just makes it so much easier to go from rare to rare, treasure chests, etc. Granted here in about a week it won't matter since I'll be able to fly, but until this boy does it suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not unknown for blizzard to scrap projects they are unhappy with, especially if they don't have the available resources to make it work. Every wow expansion they scrap ideas that look almost finished, simply because they are unhappy with how it turned out, and can't throw more time into it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Misuteri</div><div class="date">2019-07-01, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing i'm most happy about is Blizzard not making Dota.The way they failed miserably with Hots makes a huge impression.Their whole E-sport scene is one big mess.<br />
<br />
This is pretty much what happens when a game is driven by profit from the ground up.<br />
<br />
Instead of making a great game and figuring out the best way to incorporate features into it that people would pay for they look at models that make money and try and figure out more ways to make money the same way.<br />
<br />
How many energy/gem type games are on app stores that no one will even download vs something like Fortnite that no one in their right mind would pay for yet makes a billion dollars?<br />
<br />
HOTS shot itself in the foot so many ways, the least of which was having 3 in game currencies trying to be profitable. It’s too hard to hook someone into playing when it takes a few days to figure out what they can and can’t do with what they earn.</div></div><hr />

Scrapping projects that has come very far isn’t uncommon in most businesses. Even if you’ve invested a lot of money in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a matter of finishing it or not, it's getting it to a level they were happy with. They completely finished Warcraft Adventures (and a fully playable build has been leaked now) but never released it because it wasn't up to their standard for quality.<br />
<br />
At the time Ghost was in development, Blizzard was also a much smaller company. Though they had huge successes, they didn't become the giant they are today until well after World of Warcraft launched, and even then they were focusing most of their resources on developing and maintaining WoW.<br />
<br />
It took them a while to get to a point where they could really spread resources out to other projects (SC2 and D3) because they had to focus so much on WoW. There were several years there where Blizzard became &quot;the World of Warcraft company.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure WoW's story would have continued on, like Everquest's story continues despite EQ2 being a thing. He did say it involved time travel, so it probably would of existed outside the scope of WoW's timeline so it wouldn't interfere with it. Feels like we got a dose of the idea with WoD, maybe?<br />
<br />
Blizzard typically doesn't run two games in the same genre at the same time. It is unclear if/when WoW would have shut down if they had a new game out.<br />
<br />
People said WoD was &quot;rushed&quot; and &quot;light on content&quot; and it sounds like Titan might be why that happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Project Titan had nothing to do with Warcraft. It was set on Earth. A bunch of the character designs in Overwatch are direct holdovers from Titan.<br />

People said WoD was &quot;rushed&quot; and &quot;light on content&quot; and it sounds like Titan might be why that happened.<br />
Legion is why that happened. They have gone over this multiple times. They tried to cut WoD short and expanded the team because they were trying to push to yearly expansions, but they hit development bottlenecks that caused Legion to take way longer than expected.<br />
<br />
Project Titan's team became the Project Prometheus team, which designed Overwatch. Team 4.</div></div><hr />

You dont try to compete with your own franchises. Titan was supposed to be sequel to wow in the sense that they wanted people to move from one subscription based mmo to another.</div></div><hr />

They wouldn't really be competing. They were very different games. Titan was an FPS MMO with a near future sci-fi setting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of making a great game and figuring out the best way to incorporate features into it that people would pay for they look at models that make money and try and figure out more ways to make money the same way.<br />
<br />
How many energy/gem type games are on app stores that no one will even download vs something like Fortnite that no one in their right mind would pay for yet makes a billion dollars?<br />
<br />
HOTS shot itself in the foot so many ways, the least of which was having 3 in game currencies trying to be profitable. It’s too hard to hook someone into playing when it takes a few days to figure out what they can and can’t do with what they earn.<br />
<br />
It didn't launch with those currencies. They were part of HotS 2.0 which actually saved the game for a while because it turns out. No, having things available just for cash does not generate revenue.</div></div><hr />
