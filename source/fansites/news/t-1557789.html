Curse of Naxxramas: A Hearthstone Adventure<br />
<br />
Curse of Naxxramas offers a new single player campaign to play Hearthstone against challenging NPC adversaries. Curse of Naxxramas can be unlocked with gold or real money and can be accessed by players that have unlocked all 9 heroes.<br />
Defeat 15 fearsome bosses to unlock a total of 30 new Hearthstone cards (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?display=1&amp;filter-boss-cards=0&amp;filter-set=100) for your collection, including Legendary cards! Naxxramas cards can easily be searched for within My Collection using the search function.<br />
An all-new interactive Naxxramas-themed game board awaits you within the Adventure! Discover the surprises that lurk inside the slime pools, the quivering masses of spider eggs (spoilers: It’s spiders), and more!<br />
Surmount 9 diabolical Class Challenges that test your skills with each of the unique classes of Hearthstone!<br />
Defeating all of the bosses within a wing unlocks the extremely challenging Heroic Mode of that wing. Defeating all of the bosses of Naxxramas on Heroic mode unlocks a new card back for your collection.<br />
Five unique wings await those brave enough to venture into Naxxramas. The first wing, The Arachnid Quarter, will immediately be available to play for free for a limited time. The remaining four wings are immediately available for players to unlock with real money or gold, and will become accessible over a period of time once unlocked. <br />
<br />
The Arachnid Quarter – A web choked maze filled with many-legged minions.<br />
The Plague Quarter – Necromancers brew deadly plagues while a fungal monstrosity lies in wait.<br />
The Military Quarter – Tireless undead knights perfect their deadly arts within these chambers.<br />
The Construct Quarter –Abominations stitched together from the Scourge’s victims stomp through these slime soaked halls.<br />
Frostwyrm Lair – Chilly abode of Sapphiron (http://www.hearthpwn.com/guides/542-naxxramas-sapphiron-boss-overview) and the arch-lich Kel’thuzad (http://www.hearthpwn.com/guides/541-naxxramas-kelthuzad-boss-overview) himself. (A curse upon my air conditioning bill!)<br />

<br />
Why carry water for Blizzard? That's not a valid excuse for a botched launch. I'm not even sure if anyone is able to play Naxxramas at the moment. From my memory of the launch of WoTLK, the launch was pretty smooth, bar the reneging on Death Knights on other servers and lie about aerial combat.<br />
<br />
You're not getting any brownie points for excusing performance beyond mediocrity on behalf of Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I hear you on that, the AI is definitely a little wonky. I played Maexxna and got utterly destroyed the first match and then the second match it was like the AI wasn't even playing. Then I had one against Faerlina where the boss set me up for a win, I had one card out with was a 4/6 and the boss attacked my card cause it had 2 of the +1 worshiping minions out and attacked my card with it and then attacked my hero with the rest of her cards and that put her at 8 health left. Well, I was playing Paladin and had a blessing of kings in my deck and applied it to my card and won. It was rather silly that the AI would set itself up for a defeat like that.</div></div><hr />

That may be the name of the site. But it's expanded to go to all Blizzard products rather than just WoW, including important patches and information relevant to the game universes of Blizzard: WoW, Diablo, Hearthstone, Starcraft and Heroes of the Storm; while also touching other MMOs now and then.<br />
Long since has it been strictly only WoW; however WoW is still the main topic of the site (with other Blizzard products as secondary).</div></div><hr />

There's significant overlap in the WoW and Hearthstone community and it's not like there are constant posts about Hearthstone.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but as with all major Blizzard game releases, we are mentioning it as well.</div></div><hr />

You're most likely joking, but in the case your not.<br />
<br />
There's a WoW team.<br />
<br />
And there's a Hearthstone team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The only diabolical Challenge is to connect to the game on the European servers. <br />
Because is hard to have a good launch when you are such an inexperienced developer like Blizzard. <br />
Being their first online game launch we understand that they lack the knowledge to avoid those issues.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to clarify that this maintenance is not for the Curse of Naxxramas Adventure. We will be turning on Curse of Naxxramas for all regions at the same time some time after this maintenance is complete, but please do not expect Naxxramas to be available immediately following this maintenance.<br />

That's not a valid excuse for a botched launch. I'm not even sure if anyone is able to play Naxxramas at the moment. From my memory of the launch of WoTLK, the launch was pretty smooth, bar the reneging on Death Knights on other servers and lie about aerial combat.<br />
<br />
You're not getting any brownie points for excusing performance beyond mediocrity on behalf of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Assuming he's doing brownie points.</div></div><hr />

People like this are never gonna believe anything so its silly to fight with them especially over something like this. Its summer, go outside. Or if you are anything like me you have other games you have put off to play wow. Go play one of those. The world is not ending, everything will be ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hearthstone, a free card game, gets content patches<br />
<br />
wow, a sub based game, gets none for about a year<br />
<br />
gg blizzard<br />
<br />
Paid content patches. It's really more like a mini expansion or DLC.<br />
<br />
Although they do allow you to use ingame gold as well.<br />
<br />
Also, it'll probably be a year before they do another.</div></div><hr />

The turns too a loong time, some server issues i assume,. to complete so it was a bit boring and random crap made the last 2 bosses take 3-4 times to complete with priest. Now heroic will require some good card pulling to complete the first boss, 4/4 every turn (or 2/3 charge)...<br />
<br />
hmm so just completed the first heroic, disconnected progress saved, restart to continue. So it seems that some server issues are still around.</div></div><hr />
