<br />
I just can't wrap my head about the logic about giving a one-time only 7% exp/rep boost when most of the people actually likely to log in during this event will have their exp and/or rep long since capped. I don't mind them giving us something other than a pet, I'd just have liked it to be something remotely useful or nice or more permanent.</div></div><hr />

Use:<br />
Increases Experience and Reputation gains from kills by 7% for 1 hour.<br />

WoW's 7th Anniversary<br />
Logged in during WoW's 7th Anniversary.<br />
Feats of Strength<br />
<br />
WoW's 7th Anniversary is the Feats of Strength achievement everyone will get for logging on during the anniversary.<br />
Meaning that the Tabard will only work if you have that achievement.<br />
<br />
The reason the tabard is only *Visual* as they call it , is because they do not want the tabard to count for tabard gathering achievements.<br />
<br />
For the sources where I got that info check : us.battle.net/wow/en/item/71134#tab=rewardFromAchievements<br />
It was already in the op's post but he himself and most of you have probably completely read over it.<br />
<br />
Anyway I am not dissapointed if it really is a permanent tabard, a bit sad that its not a heirloom I can send over to my future panda but I guess we can't have it all. <br />

Considering how there was no achievement system until patch 3.0, I'm not surprised that we ended up with two consecutive anniversary pets. Since the system was new, why not have a pet for the first WoW b-day achievement? The year afterward just happened to be a special one-time anniversary, so it got a pet too.<br />
<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with the mega anniversary.<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Here's an old blue post back from Nov 2010.<br />
<br />
It was our front page announcement of the anniversary that stated you would only receive a feat of strength. <br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1136962#blog <br />
<br />
I'd potentially concede that because we didn't clearly state &quot;You won't get a pet&quot; people still held out some hope, but I also don't feel we were in the wrong by including all of the correct information. <br />
<br />
We've never stated that every year we'd give a pet for the anniversary. I realize for the last two years that's been the case, and I do apologize that it created an expectation which wasn't met. I don't though believe we've somehow misled anyone as our announcement was clear and complete in the information it provided.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, WoW's 7th Anniversary is the name of the event, which lasts for 2 weeks so that will be the duration of the items you get, after the event itself is over the items will vanish like the other event items, there was never an item that required a FoS to use, and tbh that would make no sense, tho I wish we could keep it forever as other vanity items, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

While I would find it tremendously funny to have a Chuck Norris Ad, the tweet where they first announced the ad suggests it's a hunter ad, Chuck Norris would clearly have his own class, The Badass, not a puny hunter :D<br />

You any idea how long &amp; the amount of effort it requires for them to come up with a new pet each time?<br />

I'm still pissed I threw away or skipped out on tabards from previous events and they ended up being achieves. I don't want to deal with that pointless anxiety anymore. I have lots of items that aren't obtainable anymore, where's my achieves for them? The small experience / rep boost will be nice as long as it persists through death or is auto-activated just for being logged into the world during the event. The TV ad has to be Chuck Testa. It's being played during a football game with Bears and Chargers. Animals, leather, stiff bodyparts: What more could Chuck Testa ask for? &quot;Is that another WoW commercial? Nope, just Chuck Testa.

You MUST mean it will last 7 more months...LOL<br />
<br />
In reality, it will lose about 1 million players a quarter. So when Blizzard has there quarterly announcement in November of 2012, WoW will have less than 6 million players. And that is being very generous, I predict even less. Naturally, server consolidation will occur.<br />
<br />
If you are still playing Warcraft in 3 years, which means it will be a 10 year old game, you must also enjoy Atari, Commodore 64, and Nintendo 8-bit games.<br />
The graphics of Warcraft are well behind the times. This is without even talking about the failing game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for proving my point.<br />
<br />
Because so many Hardcore players have left, many guilds have to count on lesser players.<br />
Also, there are less guilds because of mergers.<br />
Therefore, when a 25-Man Raid has 10 Hardcore raiders and 15 casuals, it's difficult to be successful.</div></div><hr />

The hardcore raiders and top guilds disbanded after they removed attunements during and after ICC? As in Icecrown Citadel? Yeah. That's what happened. Right.</div></div><hr />

I know you are not a successful Hardcore Raider.<br />
<br />
Let me know when a Top Guild raider refutes what I have stated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 7% bonus is just for kills so this won't help you with DMF rep</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean come on, they`ve got to find something they haven`t reskin`d already hence no pet last year too ;P<br />
<br />
Yet the pet store has constant additions ... go figure.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baelroc</div><div class="date">2011-11-21, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering how there was no achievement system until patch 3.0, I'm not surprised that we ended up with two consecutive anniversary pets. Since the system was new, why not have a pet for the first WoW b-day achievement? The year afterward just happened to be a special one-time anniversary, so it got a pet too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Here's an old blue post back from Nov 2010.<br />
<br />
It was our front page announcement of the anniversary that stated you would only receive a feat of strength. <br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1136962#blog <br />
<br />
I'd potentially concede that because we didn't clearly state &quot;You won't get a pet&quot; people still held out some hope, but I also don't feel we were in the wrong by including all of the correct information. <br />
<br />
We've never stated that every year we'd give a pet for the anniversary. I realize for the last two years that's been the case, and I do apologize that it created an expectation which wasn't met. I don't though believe we've somehow misled anyone as our announcement was clear and complete in the information it provided.<br />
<br />
And yet nothing you posted here proves that the only reason we got a pet before was a &quot;mega anniversary.&quot; Only that Blizz will sometimes award pets and sometimes not, which is exactly what I was alluding to.</div></div><hr />
