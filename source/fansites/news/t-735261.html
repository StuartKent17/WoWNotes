Azeroth's inhabitants endure a lifetime of struggle and conflict. They're subject to violence from neighboring enemies and rampaging beasts at an early age, and must learn to take up arms to defend themselves against predators. Regularly forced to cope with the deaths of friends, family, and members of their tribes, clans, cities, and guilds, these scarred survivors become stronger by reinforcing their walls, banding together with new allies, and raising sharp, careful, resilient children. They adapt. They change.<br />
<br />
Few places on Azeroth exemplify this ever-changing dynamic more than the Twilight Highlands of the Eastern Kingdoms.<br />
<br />
The highlands have undergone constant upheaval throughout their history, with races and factions thriving, collapsing, and changing seemingly without pause. The fortress-city of Grim Batol has played host to no fewer than three potent factions: the Wildhammer dwarves, who abandoned their home after a Dark Iron curse left it uninhabitable; the red dragonflight, which was forced to fight for the Horde in the captivity of the Dragonmaw orcs during the Second War; and, of course, the Dragonmaw themselves, who were driven from Grim Batol when the red dragonflight was finally freed from their grasp.<br />
<br />
The Dragonmaw now cling to the edges of the highlands. They're no less wild and difficult to deal with than when they ruled Grim Batol, but their knowledge of dragons and warfare is of unquestionable importance, especially amidst the chaos of the Cataclysm. The Wildhammer dwarves dwell in forested outposts among the highlands' mountains; though long friendly with the Alliance, they have only now begun to consider casting their lot in with Stormwind and Ironforge thanks to the entreaties of their cousins, the Bronzebeard clan. Even the mighty red dragonflight has suffered greatly in recent months: its members have been decimated by a frenzied, newly aggressive black dragonflight attacking relentlessly from the petrified Obsidian Forest.<br />
<br />
Amidst this upheaval, a new power has come to possess the highlands.<br />
<br />
Though the environment has been given many names throughout its history, it's only been dubbed &quot;Twilight&quot; thanks to the dominance of its current masters. The fanatical Twilight's Hammer cultists appreciate the name, but there are more functional features to the swath of land they've chosen as their headquarters. It's rimmed by massive mountain peaks that scrape at the sky like fingernails, making invasion by land nearly impossible, and the highlands' black-glass beaches ensure that marine assaults are fraught with terror; ships docking on the peninsula risk running aground.<br />
<br />
More important to the cult, however, is the promise of worldly extinction and change that permeates the land. In the dimness of the highlands, shadows are deeper. The sun and the rest of Azeroth seem distant. The elements themselves are more pronounced: fires burn hotter; rain forces its way into the ground; and the heaves and shudders of the land call to mind some colossal being stirring beneath the earth. This doesn't frighten the members of the Twilight's Hammer; it lulls them to sleep.<br />
<br />
Their dark work is done here in a manner that could never have been realized in Silithus. The devoted of the Twilight's Hammer train in the halls of mighty fortresses, not tiny compounds and outposts. They summon dangerous, mercurial elementals who loathe each other to the point of outright war but still pause their feuds momentarily to work towards the destruction of the other races. Outside the highlands, the cult is fractious and divided. Here, it is guided on its mission of destruction by some of the cruelest and bloodiest names in history, yet the names associated with this cabal belie the true extent of its leadership.<br />
<br />
These dark whisperers chose the highlands as their base of operations for a reason. They can feel the presence of the Old Gods in the air and see their victory in the darkness. The shifting landscape, battling factions, and wicked elements embody the cult's vision of what its world will become as it is finally purged of life and order. The rest of Azeroth will follow the Twilight Highlands into oblivion, one way or another.<br />

Equal Effective Health among all tanks<br />
Assuming you are defining Effective Health as armor x health, then it isn't and never has been our goal to have effective health be identical among all the tanks. Cooldowns, avoidance, emergency buttons and other class mechanics are all part of that package for us. What matters to us is whether or not the four tanks can tank the content with more or less the same chance of success. That's the metric we use, not a single number. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626187952/future-of-prot-warriors/))<br />
<br />
Lack of Swords Itemization<br />
What? We love swords. Like a brother. A potentially dangerous, but nonetheless epic brother. <br />
<br />
Overall, though, a fewer number of classes can equip swords as compared to those that can equip axes and maces. As a result, when only a finite number of items can be created within a specific period of time, it makes sound design sense to create more axes and maces than one-handed and two-handed swords.<br />
<br />
Now, you may only be considering my statement in terms of itemization, but that's a trap I don't want you to fall into. Keep in mind that stats only make up half an item, and that the other half is the way the item appears in the game. We have incredibly talented, hard working artists; however, those artists still must manage their time efficiently and produce quality work that will best benefit the game. So, when determining what item artwork to develop and in what quantity, the weapon types that are used by more players (e.g. axes and maces) tend to be created in greater abundance.<br />
<br />
Even so, there's still quite a few swords planned for Cataclysm that are just downright awesome. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969017609/why-do-you-hate-swords-weapon-devs/))<br />
<br />
Cross-Realm BoA Mails<br />
Adding the ability for players to be able to mail Bind on Account items cross-realm is something we've discussed on more than one occasion. We understand that players would greatly appreciate having the option to send heirlooms, for example, to lower-level characters on different realms, so we're exploring the possibility. It's definitely on our radar! Due to the necessary infrastructure changes that would need to occur before cross-realm mail can be integrated, though, we have no immediate plans for adding this functionality as of yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968837453/boa-gear-crossserver-amiright/))<br />
<br />
Block %<br />
Without defense gear any longer and with no block rating on gear, you're probably at ~5% block, which is way too low. We need base block to be higher, but we still haven't fully decided if that's something all characters get or just warriors / paladins, or just tanks, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968986889/prinsesa-s-beta-thread/))<br />

Death Knight Tanking/Self-Healing<br />
Our intent is that DKs take more damage to compensate for all of the self-healing. As Regill points out, Blood Craze is accessible now and we want Enraged Regen to be more attractive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626187952/future-of-prot-warriors/))<br />

Omen of Clarity<br />
If I had to guess, Omen of Clarity will be a trained ability. It's too useful to different kinds of druids. Even if you put it shallow in Resto, Feral wouldn't be able to benefit from it until very high level.<br />
<br />
But we'll see.... (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25833934923/omen-of-clarity-in-cataclysm/))<br />
<br />
Eclipse<br />
I just posted a similar thing in another thread, but I wouldn't worry too much about the current Cataclysm implementation of Eclipse. We've been focused on getting the UI functional and having it get turned on at the right moment when you spec Balance. Last time I logged into the beta as a druid, I was having Eclipse procs show up in my combat log... as a Feral. Clearly it's not ready for prime time yet.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure we'd ever go with charges for the mechanic. That just goes against everything we're trying to do for class design. We don't want set rotations where you know you can go 1231 ad infinitum. We want players to respond to dynamic things happening that they won't be able to predict with 100% certainty. We want the best players to be those who pay attention, not those who can follow a rote rotation. Talents like Ruthlessness and Omen of Clarity are put in precisely to screw up rotations, but also to reward players who can handle that uncertainty.<br />
<br />
You're not going to be able to fully maximize every Eclipse proc, in the same way a mage may lose a Fireball channel if she suddenly has to move or a rogue may lose combo points if he needs to quickly switch targets. But as with those example, we also want to make sure the druid isn't totally boned if something happens and you can't take full advantage of an Eclipse.<br />
<br />
Give us a couple of beta builds, and there will be a more fully functional Eclipse that you can then comment on. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626577605/moonkn-cataclysm-discussion/))<br />
<br />
Eclipse #2<br />
I wouldn't put much stock in the current tuning of Eclipse in Cataclysm. We just barely have the mechanic working at all.<br />
<br />
We will still give Balance druids the Eclipse bar at level 10, along with an active ability. At high level, mastery on gear will enhance the Arcane and Nature bonuses of the bar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969017203/cataclysm-and-eclipse/))<br />

Divine Storm back into the talent tree<br />
After further reflection, we don't think Divine Storm makes a good level 10 Ret ability. It really wants to be an AE attack, and it's just hard to make an AE attack a signature ability usable in as many situations as a signature attack deserves to be.<br />
<br />
Divine Storm will probably go back into the talent tree. It won't be the 31-point though. Both the 31-point and the 10 ability need to have more single-target use. That means something like 3 new abilities for Retribution and several new or modified talents on top of that. Crazy.<br />
<br />
As you can see, we're still iterating a lot on paladins. Our lack of communication is because things are changing quickly, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to share it all until things feel a little more stable.

<br />
Beacon of Light in Cataclysm (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626350624/do-you-feel-like-beacon-needs-removal-why/))<br />
Paladin healing with Beacon is a lot more dynamic than it was without. :)<br />
<br />
I think it works fine with the Cataclysm healing style. It will let you (sometimes) heal two targets at once, which is a great use of GCDs. <br />
<br />
Beacon of Light does need dispel protection, or PvP is going to suck. Same with sacred shield. <br />
Dispels are more expensive in Cataclysm in a few ways. I'm not sure it's going to be very strategic to dispel a spell that can immediately be reapplied. <br />

Pet scaling<br />
The plan is for your pets to scale 100% with your stats. In fact, group buffs don't even work on pets any longer so that they don't double dip from those buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Removing Passive Talents<br />
If you look at the warlock trees, there are tons of talents that buff Corruption and add range and crit damage and whatever. A couple of those per tree are okay but clearly we need to remove a lot of them and that means adding new talents, which unfortunately is slow. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Soul Harvest (Soul Harvest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/79268/soul-harvest/))<br />
Outside of combat (which means between encounters, not when you can get out of combat for 2 sec in an Arena), you can get the shards back quickly from killing things or using Harvest Soul if there is nothing conveniently around to kill. We don't want Harvest Soul to be super convenient. It's your backup option.<br />
<br />
If we find that it's super frustrating as a lock in a long encounter (including a long Arena match), then we'll look at ways to get shards back in combat. However our prediction is as soon as we do that, locks will start blowing their shards on cooldown and then getting frustrated at a slow Aspect of the Viper-like mechanic to get them back. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626051225/harvest-soul-is-lame/))<br />
<br />
Soul Link<br />
Our thought at the moment is to put Soul Link in the second tier of talents where it is accessible to any PvP-focused warlock. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290914/lock-with-no-soul-link/))<br />

Plans for Last Stand<br />
I said that we'd like to remove the glyph and just make the talent all there is. Not sure if we would use the glyphed or unglyphed cooldown yet though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br />

[b]Thunder Clap Spam<br />
We're not happy with the no cooldown model. We'll try to handle the terror of &quot;streaming adds&quot; in another way. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968986889/prinsesa-s-beta-thread/))<br />
<br />
Fury / Victory Rush<br />
Also, is there still a chance fury will get a new melee attack or is the whole victory rush thing that GC talked about the new plan? <br />
Undecided.<br />
<br />
Our concern about Victory Rush is that Arms already has two big procs to watch for (Overpower and Execute) compared to Fury's one (Slam). Adding Victory Rush procs to Fury makes them feel a lot more like Arms. The right answer might lie somewhere outside of Victory Rush.

The sometimes on BoL imo means that you dont use it every time so when you do, you will heal 2 targets, they would never make this RNG, it would be useless.<br />

first of all the one with the Alliance vs. Horde, the drawing skill is very good here.<br />
But I feel I have to make a bit comment...<br />
On the left, the Night Elf Druid, it took me some time to realize it actually was a Night Elf. Too much torso vs. too skinny mid. <br />
The Draenei looks really good! Alltho it's a bit odd him being a Paladin and casting some lightning stuff. (at least to me it really doesn't look like some Holy spell)<br />
The others look absolutely fine and the Human Priest looks cute :)<br />
On the right side, the Blood Elf seems to be female as she has boobies, but the face looks more male than female to me. Same goes for the Troll as well to be honest.<br />
I think the Undead is a bit... too undead? <br />
But the Orc and the Tauren look ab-so-lutely fucking amazing! I really like those. Also the Shaman T2 shoulder armor on the Tauren is done really nice.<br />
Despite my comments I think all in all it's a damn great picture!</div></div><hr />

Ever consider the possibility that they're simply being coy? Most of the things you mention are not in any way game-changing, so I have no doubt Blizzard simply has other things on their plate. Any one of those changes could happen in a simple patch...most could be implemented without the expansion at all. As for the other things:<br />
<br />
Blizzard knows what they're doing to Stranglethorn Vale. They just don't want you to know what they're doing with it until it's finished.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said people will be able to test the 31-point talents during the next major beta build. When they'll release I'm sure is up in the air at this point, and should that be surprising? I'm sure they'll be constantly tweaking those talents all the way up until release.<br />
<br />
Just seems like a lot of nitpicking to me. Blizzard could simply not answer questions at all, and leave you completely in the dark. Instead, they're answering what they can, and teasing you about what they can't. It literally means nothing in terms of where they are in development.</div></div><hr />

I was kind of thinking the same thing. It seem they can't think of what to do with any of the classes. The fact that they removed block value, but have nothing to substitute it with. God knows what they plan on doing with Ret pallys, they are the only class i know of that you can get all your talents you need for raiding, and still have 20 talent points free.</div></div><hr />

It won't be the 31-point though. Both the 31-point and the 10 ability need to have more single-target use. That means something like 3 new abilities for Retribution and several new or modified talents on top of that. Crazy.<br />
<br />
This almost makes me want to start playing again and level a new paladin.. just, WOW!<br />
Not only the new attacks for retri, but also the new heal that is about 65%~ stronger than the current holy light.<br />
So leveling a retri, then playing holy in 85, seems pretty interesting imo. Maybe paladins will finally feel like a real class!<br />
Also, there's nothing wrong about previously announced shaman changes, I really like those too. :D<br />

Ehm, todays warriors really do need nerfs.. Meeting an arms warrior in arena that have 45k hp unbuffed and still critting clothies for half their hp on one attack, that really needs nerfing &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

No.<br />

Things like a solution for:<br />
<br />
- Forbearance: this has to be changed for all three trees. There's no other class suffering from something like this.<br />
- Protection - silence weakness: hello at 1 attack avaible besides auto attack.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for all three speccs, because I'm just playing prot as main - I'm sure there are a lot of others points, which I couldnt have think of right now.</div></div><hr />

Wich game you play? As a full wrathfull Warrior i have 34k hp unbuffed and crit for 2k at best on anything equaly geared. So i don't think you're talking about WoW. Unless you talk about Warriors wielding shadowmourne, who will have even less health/resil, shadowmourne isn't balanced, no matter wich class wields it, and no class should be balanced around a legendary considering an only extremely small percentage of person of said class will ever have it.<br />

No.<br />

Forbearance exists because some of your spells are just EXTREMELY powerfull, same reason why Titan Grip has a 10% damage reduction. Paladins chaining Bubble, hand of protection and LOH wasn't fine by any mean.<br />
<br />
DKs are weak to silence too, and you don't suffer as much from disarm, so its only a counter part. Disarmed warrior : hello at 1 attack availlable besides auto attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 47k HP unbuffed in my ICC25 off-spec tanking gear fully gemmed/enchanted for health/stamina.<br />
<br />
In 5s, with Commanding shout, Blessing of Kings, Mark of the Wild and Prayer of fortitude the highest i ever had was around 42k in PvP gear. So unless you fight Warriors in tank gear on your battlegroup, its completly impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
And out of curiosity, you mind linking me the armory of your Lock/Priest? (The only 2 class that could possibly ever complain about a Warrior.) I'm curious.<br />
<br />
Heres mine, in complete Wrathfull Gear :http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Undermine&amp;cn=Zergall<br />
<br />
(And before you say something stupid, the ranged weapon wouldn't give me 10k HP, and absolutly no 2300+ rated Warrior would play with that gear setup considering how crappy their damage would be. Most of them run with 70%+ arp.).</div></div><hr />

I know what Forberance does and why it was added, but it doesnt change the fact that it is a cheap solution. Totally no thought put in. I'm mostly talking from a PvE point of view, but why a class is even able to force the paladin into self healing himselfs 3 times before kills you? There's a huge balance issue and I doubt Blizzard realise this in time, I see another mid-TBC for Rets and again, more PvE nerfs because of PvP.<br />
<br />
You probably didnt understand, but I'm unable to do anything while silenced - just run. And with rated BGs coming this is a huge problem. All classes, except of Druids and Paladins (just BEs) csn silence you in one way or another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Roughly 2300 health, wich would give a grand total of 37350 health. Still pretty far from 45k unbuffed. And any full wrathfull healer could tank such warrior for days, considering how dependant on arp we are and gems gives roughly 30% arp, wich is awefull. But i can't even know who i'm arguing with so i'm probably wasting my time, considering i know pretty much every single possible warrior setup for this season.</div></div><hr />

Highest I've seen ever is around 35k, and that's in full Wrathful, including weapon. If you're seeing a Warrior with 45k unbuffed, he's probably Prot, or was actually buffed, and you're trying to convince us that he wasn't.</div></div><hr />

No threat reduction in talents? Bout fucking time thank you :]]]<br />
The whole redoing the talent tree in general was the best news so far imo. Playing casually since 2004 this is very refreshing to hear, they just got way too convoluted<br />
<br />

Disarming bladestorm<br />

Overpower is how I get kills, chaining two Taste for Blood-procs, a mortal strike and execute. I know we get HS as an attack of its own, but really, with more health and more slows we'll need to have a pretty constant flow of blows to get people down, especially with our &quot;execute&quot; not executing for shit. My execute is a combo of four abilities or bladestorm, but most saves some ohshitbuttons because zomg bladestorm OP, so that's more like a lower the HP before the actual kill. ;P <br />
<br />
I'll never stop playing on my warrior, because it's fun, and I'm actually pretty content with the class ATM, even though I notice problems. Really getting on a hot streak, charging, 'cepting, perfectly executing a stream of hits and seeing my opponent fall over gives me the biggest kicks a game has ever given me. Never could I ever stop playing a warrior. And I'm an optimistic fella, I have never doubted that warrior will be fun in Cata too. Gushing wound, heroic leap, victory rush selfheal, heroic strike as an additional ability, good stuff. But certain changes blow my mind. Unrelenting assault &lt;/3 And I gotta be honest, I AM glad I dual main warrior and my good ol' warlock.</div></div><hr />

What's this about PvP Warriors with 45k HP?<br />
<br />
Highest I've seen ever is around 35k, and that's in full Wrathful, including weapon. If you're seeing a Warrior with 45k unbuffed, he's probably Prot, or was actually buffed, and you're trying to convince us that he wasn't.<br />
<br />
I stated that he used STAMINA TRINKET, also, in full wrath gear, you have almost 39k~ without a stam trinket.<br />
I don't care if you havn't seen one, there is plenty. Why don't you people just give it up.<br />
Boring as hell to deal with people that just DENY EVERYTHING.<br />
mmkey?<br />

I don't see any paladin complaining about nerfs? Besides, we are not even getting nerfed. Not as I see it anyway.<br />
Also, paladins was good maybe 1-2 weeks in the beginning of the first arena season in wotlk, since then retri have been sh*t, also holy was nerfed alot.<br />
If some class needs a real nerf it's resto druids in arena.<br />
The only time paladins were good at all was the last week of TBC.. that was GOOD.<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm not sure we'd ever go with charges for the mechanic. That just goes against everything we're trying to do for class design. We don't want set rotations where you know you can go 1231 ad infinitum. We want players to respond to dynamic things happening that they won't be able to predict with 100% certainty. We want the best players to be those who pay attention, not those who can follow a rote rotation. &quot;<br />
<br />
So, I wonder if he has the same philosophy towards Shadow Orbs? As it is, they're simply a charge mechanic. They're the Shadow mastery just like Eclipse is Balance's mastery, and in current *beta* iteration, they seem kind of lame. I was kinda expecting them to become UI elements like a Lock's Soul Shards.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, Shadow Orbs just seems like kind of a half-baked idea that should either be scrapped or just stay a gimmicky talent like Eclipse used to be, and they should make vampiric embrace the mastery instead, or something.</div></div><hr />

Boring is subjective. Just because you find playing a warrior boring doesn't mean I do. If you met a warrior with 45k hp UB he's prot.

<br />
Ive played my warrior and my druid in the 2300-2600 ratings and ive never once in my history of arena in this season seen a warrior with 45k unbuffed health that could even put a dent in me. PERHAPS what you saw was a full prot warr, with a recklessness &gt; Shield block &gt; Gag order &gt; Shield slam with the 10% buff to shield slam dmg glyph up. That could in theory drop you down half health instantly. <br />
<br />
But do not try to say you've seen it with your own eyes, and even if we dont believe you it happened. Because fact is, it didn't.<br />
<br />
Warriors do insane dmg because of ARP and thats about it. Without arp, which you would have to lose almost all ARP gems to reach 45k health unbuffed due to stam gems and stam trinkets ie. no DBW, a warrior wouldnt hit any harder than a holy paladin meleeing you.<br />
<br />
and even if by chance you fought a prot warrior, prots dont use prot gear. They barely even use pvp gear at all. TYPICALLY (not always the case obviously) they wear full pve dps gear for arp with 2 pc t10 prot gear for extra dmg or 2 pc wrathful for the crit and resil.<br />
<br />
You are simply wrong. Im not trying to flame you but geez, you are clearly exaggerating to a ridiculous extent and you have no sources to back any of your claims up with.<br />

<br />
Yea, thats pretty much what I got out of it considering they already have the framework in place to do it, and could have an intern (I am an intern, and put in a similar system for a game that was adding a microtransaction cash shop in this amount of time) do it in about a week, then have that intern go through and refactor code for the 3.3.9 patch and the 4.0 patch over the next month.<br />
The framework they already have in place is the sparklepony, battle.net, and authenticator rewards. (chilly the penguin and the core hound pup)<br />
So the only reason I can think of that they would hold off on it is because they're not sure how many transfers/month they would lose. Let alone faction transfers. Those combined cost $55 per character. The only reason it isn't in the game yet is because some manager somewhere said it is not a priority, and they probably based that off of projected revenue losses.</div></div><hr />

UBRS is one of my favorite instances, is it being taken out all together? <br />
<br />
UBRS is a 10 man raid dungeon. And it not part of the LFD system. Also it shares the same ID as LBRS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scholomance is 38-44? Does this mean my valor dungeon tier is getting its stats lowered? Or removed?</div></div><hr />

Low Level Tribute Run?<br />
<br />
...Please? &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Yea it is on Beta currently. Can't see why they would remove the tribute run tbh. <br />
<br />
<br />
OT<br />
They should make UBRS into a low level (45-50) 10 man and add it to LFD! We need more UBRSing in this game</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the moment, it would seem so. I watched TB's video of the Gnome starting zone, but it seemed to be so poorly done compared to Worgen, Goblin, and Troll that I assumed it must be unfinished.<br />
<br />
Well, that and the fact they start in the exact same spot as on live. The Trolls were moved to Echo Isles, so I assumed the Gnomes would be moved to Gnomeregan.<br />

I understand that, but given changes to the level range of mobs in those instances, I want to know of there will be changes to the UBRS portion. There is no reason to assume they meant UBRS as well when they said LBRS</div></div><hr />

Or you could place them side-by-side with both sort orders. When I am looking for what zones are 80-85, the list you have on the main post just makes it much more difficult to find them quickly.</div></div><hr />

We understand that players would greatly appreciate having the option to send heirlooms, for example, to lower-level characters on different realms, so we're exploring the possibility. It's definitely on our radar! Due to the necessary infrastructure changes that would need to occur before cross-realm mail can be integrated, though, we have no immediate plans for adding this functionality as of yet.<br />
<br />
Bull....fucking....shit. Make heirloom items function like CE and event pets. Where when you make a new character, every heirloom you have purchased is sent via in game mail to your character to be picked up. It's not hard at all. Bunch of lazy bastards.</div></div><hr />
