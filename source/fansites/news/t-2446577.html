<br />
Inside Warcraft III: Reforged Panel<br />
<br />
Classic games was started to preserve these iconic Blizzard games.<br />
It was a natural progression to move to Warcraft III after their work on Starcraft.<br />
It was hard to keep the remaster under wraps because of the updates that were happening to the original game.<br />
It is not unfair to say that the art of the original game does not hold up as well as the gameplay has. This is why the graphics are getting updated.<br />
They originally went with a more cartoony look for the new graphics, but it seemed too much like a lot of other games.<br />
The team looked to the Mists of Pandaria cinematic as a base for what orcs and humans should look like in Warcraft III: Reforged.<br />
The same engine is being used for Warcraft III: Reforged as the original game with some minor tweaks.<br />
The tools used to create the new art will also be available to the community with the world editor.<br />
The community is what has primarily kept this game alive and the team wants to give back for that.<br />
The team has learned a lot of lessons from other RTS games they have made and can use these lessons in Warcraft III: Reforged.<br />
The team wants the locations you know from World of Warcraft to be better showcased and look more like they do in WoW for this remaster.<br />
The team has been trying to roll out a lot of quality of life improvements for the current game to prepare for the remaster. This includes patching and lag issues.<br />
The team wanted to get rid of limitations that no longer pose an issue in modern gaming.<br />
Opening Port 6112 to play custom games will no longer be a thing!<br />
Warcraft III: Reforged will be added to the Battle.net Launcher.<br />
At the end of the day, this is an evolution of Warcraft III. The graphics that you see are actually being added on top of the existing engine.<br />
World of Warcraft's engine is based off of Warcraft III. The team took the changes and lessons that WoW has had with its engine and incorporated it into Warcraft III: Reforged.<br />
All of the animations and attack swings are from the original engine.<br />
The team doesn't want to break apart the original community and so are trying to keep the game anchored to the original.<br />
The team can add a lot more personality to the game with new infrastructure as long as the core gameplay stays the same.<br />
The artists are slightly constrained by the old game's animations.<br />
All of the maps created over the years on the original game need to be able to load up in Warcraft III: Reforged with the new art assets.<br />
The team wanted to lift up the lesser used heroes to reach the power of ones like the Demon Hunter.<br />
The team has communicated with competitive players all over to address the changes that have been made to the game.<br />
The team wants to continue to communicate with the community to build the game in a way that pleases players.<br />
They have taken modern gaming steps to get the game released faster.<br />
They have partnered and hired people from the community to make sure the game stays true to the original.<br />
The UI is decoupled to allow the map makers to customize the UI in a way that they could not in the past.<br />
The team wants to have as many created maps to work with the new editor from day 1 of release.<br />
If maps take advantage of bugs or are broken they will be addressed.<br />
They will release the tools that they use and guides on how to use them.<br />
The original graphics and audio will still be available and can be used on command if you desire.<br />
The original SD models and textures will also look much better.<br />
There will be functionality to merge your current account into Battle.net to keep your win records and achievements.<br />
The team doesn't want to tell you how to play the game. This is your game!<br />
The team wants to improve the join functionality. There is a possibility you will be able to que as a group of 2 and matched with 2 strangers for a 4 v 4.<br />
The focus right now is getting the existing game right, but there is potential for new stories and campaigns in the future.<br />
They moved Arthas's entrance to the Culling of Stratholme to the southern entrance to showcase the familiarity to the WoW dungeon version from Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
The community needs to work together to teach new players about the game.<br />

I'm wondering if they're going to change it like it was in the book or just remaster the original one.<br />

I heard that they're changing a few things, like Stratholme being more WoW-alike etc.</div></div><hr />

Original voice actors for Warcraft III or they changing those too? The original Arthas VA was much better than Wrath's.<br />

Voice acting seemed like new voice actors for the Culling of Stratholme thing. But they didn't seem bad. And hell, I might be wrong about that...</div></div><hr />

How's that sexist? He doesn't look like any portrayal of Arthas ever. He also looks like a longhaired blonde lady. He's Jaina sans lipstick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like they ported models from Warcraft 3 into WoW before, no, those boars in Durotar looking strangely similiar to those quilbeasts summoned by the beastmaster is total coincidence, alongside the next to identical animations.</div></div><hr />

They said you will be able to switch on old graphics and audio on command. Hopefully it will be possible to use new graphics and old audio.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, as nice as all the new models are, it's kind of weird seeing them going with a more realistic style closer to the cinematics, rather than something a bit more comic book or cartoon inspired. I'm not used to seeing Blizzard characters rendered this way in-game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Original voice actors for Warcraft III or they changing those too? The original Arthas VA was much better than Wrath's.<br />
There are contracts and such in place, so expect new voice acting for any characters that changed voice actors over the years. It should be easy to mod in the old voices either way if it's a big deal to you.</div></div><hr />

I find this unfortunate. I'm really put off by the hyper-realism direction of the art, and the new cutscenes look like a sad knockoff Chinese or Korean MMO.<br />
<br />
What I found most charming about the Warcraft series is its cartoon-ish looks. One of the things I love the most about Heroes of the Storm is that the heroes and maps brought into there feel like more faithful remasters than this.</div></div><hr />

Uther and Jaina definitely use the original audio. Arthas sounds as if it's the new guy trying really hard to sound like the old guy. I just compared the lines, it's definitely a different actor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this confirms what I kind of expected; they are reusing the old actors if they can, but they are using new ones where they can't. I expect them to change Sylvanas as well if this is the case, among others.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
On a different note, I'm really glad this game is coming not just for myself; this will introduce a broader audience to the excellent storywriting in Warcraft III. It will be nice for players to see where World of Warcraft's story came from if they didn't already know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the confusing part, at least with Jaina and Uther in that trailer they played, is that they aren't &quot;reusing&quot; the old actors - they literally just took the audio files from the original game and inserted them into the new one (which is expected really). But if they're just reusing the original files, why bother recasting Arthas?<br />
<br />
The only reason I can think of is that they may not be allowed to use his voice, due to their falling out with the original actor.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure someone will release a mod with all the original voice actors, it's actually pretty easy to do.</div></div><hr />

I don't really get the appeal of this remaster. The higher resolution models look bad on the low resolution ground. The comic look made it not as jarring as it is now. In addition having a WC1 or WC2 remaster or even better remake would've been cool. Giving people the option to actually replay the history of WC. After all WC3 still works on current computers.</div></div><hr />

But if they're just reusing the original files, why bother recasting Arthas?<br />
<br />
The only reason I can think of is that they may not be allowed to use his voice, due to their falling out with the original actor.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure someone will release a mod with all the original voice actors, it's actually pretty easy to do.<br />
<br />
Very odd indeed. This seems like a good question to ask Blizzard if they do a Q &amp; A. I'm intrigued now...<br />

<br />
Seems likely; if the changes are entirely cosmetic it seems likely that they would. If it's not, then it will also probably eliminate the thousands of Warcraft III maps and such that have been created over the years... and that does seem highly unlikely.</div></div><hr />

They certainly could build those new features as comfortable interfaces for existing tech, they might bring it to both games or we might not be able to. If we are able to play with &quot;classic&quot; WC3 players it takes even more from what WC3R brings to the table as some of the changes would have to be ported to the &quot;classic&quot; version like the Battle.net update.<br />
<br />
Just being able to use old maps doesn't require you to be able to play with &quot;classic&quot; WC3 players.</div></div><hr />
