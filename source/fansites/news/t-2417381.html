Blizzard provided an update on the Quest log bug from yesterday. 
Yesterday, August 1, we made a hotfix to the game that resulted in an unexpected bug for a small number of players. Those affected lost some or all of the quests from their quest log when they moved into or out of an instance. We quickly discovered the issue and put a stop to it.

Blizzard provided an update on the Quest log bug from yesterday (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7822-Bug-Quest-Log-Being-Wiped).<br />
Yesterday, August 1, we made a hotfix to the game that resulted in an unexpected bug for a small number of players. Those affected lost some or all of the quests from their quest log when they moved into or out of an instance. We quickly discovered the issue and put a stop to it.<br />
<br />
The timeframe during which it was possible for players to be affected by this issue was 12:34 p.m. PDT to 2:48 p.m. PDT for Asian realms, and 12:34 p.m. PDT to 4:18 p.m. PDT for Americas and European realms.<br />
<br />
If you were in-game during that timeframe, and you lost quests from your quest log due to this bug, you should be able to go to the relevant quest givers and re-accept the quests.<br />
<br />
It is possible that you lost quests that can't be re-accepted. These might include multi-week quests, or quests that are no longer available. While we expect that re-accepting most multi-week quests will also restore your progress, it may not. In those cases, we suggest you contact Blizzard Customer Support (https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/product/wow/197) so that we can look into correcting your character’s quest log.<br />
<br />
We apologize for the trouble, and we appreciate your patience as we work to bring affected players back to the adventures they expect to be on.</div></div><hr />

Now, what is a better way? Just include an EU timezone in the post, or make thousands of people go figure out what time it was on their continent? You have thousands of minutes wasted on looking up the time, instead of one minute spent by Blizz poster to include this.</div></div><hr />

Why would they put EU times in the NA boards? Not NA's fault your EU boards are slow on the uptake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still feel like they should have brought servers down when this bug was detected to prevent further players from encountering the bug while they were working on fixing it, giving the magnitude of the issue.<br />

<br />
Wtf is a multi-week quest?<br />
For example, quests that require you to loot items from raids or dungeons over the course of multiple lockouts, or some of the Hidden Artifact Appearances that require you to collect items from specific WQs that may spawn infrequently.</div></div><hr />

A quest that takes multiple raid clears like shadowmourne, balance of power, etc.</div></div><hr />

It isn't as easy as you'd expect. It all changes 4 times a year at dates and times which are different everwhere.<br />

I didn't say it wouldn't have been better for Blizz to include it. But they didn't, and complaining about it wasn't going to fix it. And now everyone reading this thread has a link to get their timezone.</div></div><hr />

Its maybe because i work in logistics department that i value time spent doing something differently than an avarage joe, but one person including an information in the post they are making already is A LOT more efficient than thousands of people looking for this information after reading a post.<br />
<br />
But go on, go and play mister smartman &quot;insulting people who complain about blizzard is the new rage hehe&quot;, of course including one additional information in a post already including some information and saving many people a hassle is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
They should just use unary numeral system so that everyone can go and translate it themselves, lmao.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: to the person 2 posts below me: no idea where did you get the &quot;24 time zones&quot; from, but whatever. The fact that so many people jumped at me only proves why most of big companies need efficiency and lean specialists - because avarage joe knows shit about it.</div></div><hr />

putting 24 time zones, alot of people dont even know what time zone they are.<br />
so itys easier for them to say &quot;what time is it in EST right now&quot; then do the math<br />
then the average person to go &quot;what time zone am i in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard proving that, once again, they're just a dumpster fire of a company that can't do something so simple as patch the game without causing a major issue. Seriously, how they've managed to survive this long is beyond me. Just a shit tier company running off the fumes of what better men created.<br />
You speak out of ignorance. This soon-to-be 14-years game is made up of literally billions upon billions of code and every patch has had a hiccup. Some patch releases have been better than others, certainly, but to expect there to not be any major issue(s) is foolhardy.</div></div><hr />

The only dumpster fire is from you people grasping at straws at every turn, yet sticking around to keep bitching about this &quot;shit tier company&quot; all the same. <br />

<br />
Quests that give visual effects are regularly shut-down by Blizzard for being an unintended consequence.<br />
<br />
And holding quests for &quot;nostalgia&quot;? I think my over-arching point was...&quot;why?&quot; I mean, I suppose &quot;lolnostalgia&quot; is an answer in itself, so maybe I'm just mocking it. Or at least mocking the people getting unreasonably upset over losing these &quot;lolnostalgia&quot; quests.<br />

Just include the UTC timing then or GMT or CET or CEST but include a time for the european servers because they do not have to be the exact timing of the NA realms because hotfixes actually should not happen at the same time across different realm zones... as evidence just now shows but rolled out one after the other.<br />

POSTED SERVER TIMES!?<br />
Yes lets have them post all 300 servers server times so you have to scan through a massive list of server THEN STILL DO MATH<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Kinda not seeing the point. It doesn't matter if servers have different times, literally all they have to do is say:<br />
<br />
<br />
These servers in Europe will have hotfixes at 10PM UTC. These servers in US will have hotfixes at 5PM UTC. These servers in Asia will have hotfixes at 12AM UTC.<br />
<br />
Then, all you have to do is look at your zone area, which for me is Europe and then since I know my time zone is UTC+1, I can quickly see that my server, in this hypothetical scenario, would be hotfixed at 11PM local time.<br />

It is called Coordinated Universal Time so you don't have to convert here there and everywhere all the time. Standards are important.</div></div><hr />

Instead you have to find out that PDT is UTC-7 which means that 1230 PDT is 1230 UTC-7 or 1930 UTC, which is 2030 GMT (UTC+1)<br />

Kinda not seeing the point. It doesn't matter if servers have different times, literally all they have to do is say:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, all you have to do is look at your zone area, which for me is Europe and then since I know my time zone is UTC+1, I can quickly see that my server, in this hypothetical scenario, would be hotfixed at 11PM local time.<br />

<br />
No they didn't. They used PDT which means a 2 way conversion instead of a simple adding or subtracting of hours.<br />
<br />
PDT -&gt; Find UTC conversion -&gt; Convert to UTC -&gt; Convert to Timezone<br />
<br />
UTC -&gt; Convert to Timezone<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
And i'm saying they shouldn't because it is stupid since most people do not play in PDT areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you even understand what being efficient means?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you understand that having several people do this wastes more time and energy than blizzard actually posting the EU realm times?<br />
<br />
Do you even understand what being efficient means?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So having every person wondering what time it is on EU realms, should google? Do you understand how much time that wastes instead of blizzard just posting EU realm times?<br />
<br />
Do you even understand what being efficient means?<br />

<br />
<br />
So every person wondering should just google it wasting so much more time than if blizzard just posted server times?<br />
<br />
Do you even understand what being efficient means?<br />
<br />
<br />
Christ people today do not have the ability to think even for a second whats good or not. How sad<br />
<br />
Please show me where I said they shouldn't have put in the times.<br />
<br />
They should have but they didn't. The options then were to either get on with your life or to bitch about it. I chose to get on with my life, and I even put in a link to help others save time.<br />
<br />
Some people chose to bitch about it instead. That's on them.</div></div><hr />

Stop being deliberately obtuse.<br />
<br />
I know what my UTC is, most people know what their UTC is. <br />
I don't have to fucking write in google 'convert pdt to bst' if they simply write UTC, because I know AUTOMATICALLY that BST is UTC+1<br />
<br />
What is it that you do not get???</div></div><hr />
