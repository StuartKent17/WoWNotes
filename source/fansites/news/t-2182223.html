World of Warcraft esports is leveling up! This year we’re bringing you more ways to participate, more teams, and more live action for everyone watching at home. So if you have a competitive bone in your body (and who doesn’t?), read on for an overview of the exciting changes. There are many ways you, your team, and your community can get involved.<br />
<br />
But first, a quick—and epic—reminder of what you can expect. . . .<br />

<br />
<br />
More Teams, More Action<br />
This year, there’ll be more opportunities to prove your teams’ prowess on the world stage:<br />
<br />
<br />
Extra qualifier cups in North America and Europe, giving more teams the chance to shine.<br />
Open signups: you don’t need an Arena rating to sign on the dotted line. What’s stopping you?<br />
The top eight teams will be broadcast live, giving your team the chance to show off epic skills and the audience good reason to cheer on the teams they’re passionate about.<br />
Prize pool of $6,000. Each. Pretty sweet. *nods*<br />
<br />
<br />
Points Win Prizes: How to Qualify<br />
To advance, teams can earn points through a variety of events:<br />
<br />
<br />
Online Arena Cups award points to the top teams, so the teams with the most points qualify to their regional LAN event.<br />
Teams can sign up to compete in as many cups in their region as they want. Go, go, go!<br />
Approved community-run events can also award points—so what better reason to encourage your community to get involved? The more points you have, the more chance you have of qualifying. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Note that points are earned by teams, not individuals, so leaving your team means leaving some of your points behind. Safety in numbers, friends!<br />

Legion PvP Season Ending Soon<br />
Attention Arena and Battleground competitors! Legion PvP Season 2 is coming to a close soon. Once ended, the battle will begin again a few hours after, when Legion PvP Season 3 begins!<br />
<br />
Season 2 – End of Season Rewards<br />
If you participated in Season 2, in order to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
Refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 1 has ended.<br />
Legion Season 2 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 3 Updates<br />
With Legion Season 3, the maximum number of times you can Prestige will increase from 9 to 13.<br />
<br />
Faction-based Rewards<br />
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. The top 0.5% of Alliance PvPers will be awarded the Gladiator: Legion Season 2 achievement and mount, and the same will go to the top 0.5% of Horde PvPers. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward.<br />
<br />
Where will you rank at the end of this season?</div></div><hr />

Yes, check the interview they had today.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biomega</div><div class="date">2017-03-09, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW PvP was sort of doa as an esport, because it's so unwatchable. It's incredibly difficult for spectators to figure out what is actually going on, and distinguishing nuances is next to impossible. Without spectators, it will never be able to compete with any of the alternatives.</div></div><hr />

They would have to, unless they plan to rehash a third season with the same set.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zenga</div><div class="date">2017-03-10, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't care if it's called/considered an e-sport or not. I love watching tournaments, and I'm not alone. It's clear by now that wow pvp will never get the big numbers on twitch, for various reasons. But recent tournaments, especially the bigger, have shown that a couple of 10k people are willing to watch the games. <br />
<br />
So very exciting news for everyone who enjoys watching wow arena. For those who don't it doesn't change a thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ferrair</div><div class="date">2017-03-10, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was one of those 10k viewers, i tuned in just to get the wow rewards, muted it and switched tabs to watch other streams.<br />
<br />
WoW pvp is just... horrible. Their health stays high all the time, run around spamming skills, los los los los and suddenly, they're dead. They tried to make it work but it failed to pull in any strong numbers for a good reason, it's terrible to watch.</div></div><hr />

WoW pvp has always been a joke. It's more fun to watch paint dry.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WoWAltoholic</div><div class="date">2017-03-10, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So were all these teams &quot;clean&quot; after the real money boosting bans?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cface</div><div class="date">2017-03-10, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard had Starcraft, that was their esports, and now it feels kind of dead, don't know why exactly. <br />
<br />
Now what does Blizzard have? Overwatch? Please, that shit will never be competitive enough (but fun to play). HotS? I don't even know this one, cool enough to play, but I would not bet on this to be a good esport follower, too much competition from Dota/LoL. <br />
<br />
TL:DR I don't think Blizzard care much about esport. They don't need to, they can have success in sales.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klaps_05</div><div class="date">2017-03-10, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is only 1 way u make wow arena into esports - make a prize pool of 5 million for blizzcon. imbalances whatever they dont matter. csgo and dota are so successful because they have ridiculous prize pools.<br />
<br />
wows overall 250k or what not bcon prize pool is a joke as its not even after tax(unlike how Valve does it by covering taxes company side)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly. I'm really surprised that this is still a thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendzia</div><div class="date">2017-03-10, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally do not care about PvP in WoW but i enjoy watching some esport events so i decided to check some arena matches during Blizzcon.<br />
It was... painful decision. I had no idea what is even happening... After one match i changed stream to something else...<br />
<br />
And that silly prizepool... Is it even worth trying/practising?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superdon</div><div class="date">2017-03-10, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the breakdown of the teams?

No, you'll still be able to get the Prestige mounts from their respective achievements in future seasons.</div></div><hr />
