I wonder if people will try skipping in Everbloom. Wouldn't have minded if they didn't add Bloodmaul Slagmines.<br />
<br />
They originally had Grimrail Depot but removed it for Everbloom. Kind of a shame with GRD being super iconic (at least put it over iron docks), but I guess each dungeon picked has its own individual ambient feel to it. GRD and Docks overlap and I would have taken GRD anyway. Then again pugs wouldn't understand any of the bosses in GRD that well.<br />
<br />
As for skips, depends on what tank you get. A lot of people won't skip since they're just in it for the chance at mount, or the gear from bosses. But if you get someone that realizes how big the end XP bonus is they might try it. There's one skip that's basically a no brainer that's easy to do (run up the hill). Doubt most will though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'm a tank but that doesn't stop people stubbornly trying to skip things. I'm mostly talking about the jump on the side, not whole bosses. People just get there and stick to the skip and type in chat &quot;this way, this way&quot; and then insult you when you refuse and so on. Then you get this one case with this one dps who can't and we waste 5 minutes trying to do the jump instead of the one minute it takes to do the two trash packs. I had a few cases with people dropping group because I ignored them and just pulled the two packs. <br />
I don't even understand people who want to do skips in pugs. You're always gonna get one person who doesn't know how to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess just use the excuse of the mount drop if it comes up then, but just keep pulling trash and I doubt anyone will complain. The skip most pugs used to do is just going up on a hill behind that tree which is a low difficulty one. The one that required the Mammoth and precise jumping after 1st boss was super annoying to do though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, this makes me very happy. Because I won’t meet my goal of “buy both mounts first time around” if they did change the rotation. Right now I’m on track. If they changed it for WOD TWing to drop the next Timewalking week, I’d have to wait another full rotation. D:</div></div><hr />

I loved Grimrail for the ambiance, but it was a colossal pain in dungeon finder and that will likely carry over. That said, the final boss of Everbloom made me want to kill myself as a healer in PUGs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
midway through WoD or thereabouts they made it so that the final boss would not be attackable unless you had defeated the previous 3. at least they did on mythic difficulty, to stop people from doing it 4 times just to finish the 4 x Mythic dungeon event. Unsure on whether that change affected heroic but I imagine it would<br />

Probably foresaw all the people who never did the dungeon not knowing how to throw the mines at the boss in his cannon and wiping forever and ragequitting. Then again most of the people I ran the dungeon with when the dungeon was current didn't know how to do it either, so ymmv.</div></div><hr />

One of them was just dodging some packs. The one I disliked was the one that required you to do some stupid jumps into an area you weren't supposed to be able to jump into, which led you straight to the first boss while skipping a large portion of the trash leading to it. More often than not, the process of having everyone be able to do the jump would take longer than if you went the normal way, unless someone with a multi seat mount got up quickly.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, what I mean't was that I just can't stand all but a couple of WOD dungeons, IMO just terrible in design and execution. It was fun to do TBC dungeons properly and not while levelling in that bracket. The rage the shouting when people just didn't know what to do or wasn't willing to take 10 seconds to listen.</div></div><hr />
