<br />
Deep in the Heart of Development<br />
Yesterday Bornakk and I were in lead world designer Alex Afrasiabi's office going over more Cataclysm information to share with you lovely folks. As we were getting into the discussion, former World of Warcraft game director Jeff Kaplan stopped by to let us know he's still available for Westfall development advice if needed. As many of you are aware, Jeff did a great deal of the original design of Westfall, so his offer was quite funny to us.<br />
<br />
As we laughed he asked Alex, &quot;is there even a Westfall anymore after the Cataclysm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eastfall, Jeff. It's Eastfall now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope your day is going well. ;) <br />
<br />
Tol Barad and Wintergrasp Changes<br />
<br />
Population Balancing<br />
Keep in mind Tol Barad is still deep in development, but we do have plans to implement more stringent faction balancing measures than those which exist for Wintergrasp today. We want to have the queue system try to create a battle with as close to a 1:1 team ratio as possible. In other words, if 40 Horde and 150 Alliance players are in the queue, it's going to make the battle somewhere close to 40 vs. 40. There will be a maximum cap of players allowed on each side as there is with Wintergrasp, but there will also be a minimum cap as well. Since the system will be looking for a 1:1 team ratio, the minimum cap will be designed to ensure a battle can't be thrown by a faction if no one shows up. So, say if the minimum cap is 25, there is a chance the battle could be 25 vs. 5.<br />
<br />
Because of this new design, it'll be much more beneficial to play on a realm where the faction balance is roughly equivalent rather than seeking a realm where your faction dominates. For this reason we'll continue to monitor faction balance on all realms and work to ensure players enjoy the best gaming experience possible.<br />
<br />
[...] Right now the issue with Wintergrasp is it actually encourages the behavior of selecting a realm where your faction dominates. If the reverse becomes true for Tol Barad, that only serves to help improve faction balance rather than further impact it. In Cataclysm it will be more beneficial to be on a realm where your faction is underpopulated (which will lead to a natural trend of balancing out the population), or be on a high-population realm where the maximum Tol Barad cap is reached, or close to reached for each battle. <br />
<br />
I hate to ask, but would you explain again how the maximum and minimum caps work, or shall I say how you think they are going to work? I'm a bit confused. :x<br />
The maximum cap will essentially work the same as it does in Wintergrasp. If there are hundreds of players in the queue for Tol Barad on both sides, the system is not going to overcrowd the zone and make it unplayable. It will create an even match with up to a certain number of players on each side.<br />
<br />
The minimum cap is intended to prevent griefing from factions which are extremely underpopulated. For example, if it's 3 in the morning and the Alliance have a very low population on a realm, a single Alliance guild could decide to boycott Tol Barad. If there were no minimum cap with the 1:1 ratio queuing system, this could lead to a situation where Tol Barad ends up being a, say, 3 vs. 3 battle leaving many Horde players locked out. So if we set the minimum cap to 25, it means in this scenario that it would be 3 Alliance vs. 25 Horde. In other words, the underpopulated faction on an imbalanced realm can't fully dictate the battle size of Tol Barad all the way down to 0 participants on either side. <br />
<br />
Does this apply to Wintergrasp too?<br />
<br />
I just got word that we are planning on implementing this new balancing mechanism for Wintergrasp sometimes shortly after the next Wrath of the Lich King minor content patch. So you'll get a chance to see it in action and provide us with feedback prior to the launch of Cataclysm! <br />
<br />
So in cliff note form: With the minimum cap is 25, if 25 Horde que and 150 alliance que, the battle will be 25 vs 25.<br />
And if 25 Horde que, and 10 alliance que, will it then just 10 v 10 or 25 v 10? <br />
<br />
Your first example is correct. For your second example, the battle would be 25 Horde vs. 10 Alliance. <br />
<br />
1) Will Tol'Barad flag players between battles on PvE servers? Please say yes!<br />
2) Will flying mounts be disabled in the zone when the battle isn't taking place?<br />
<br />
The current plan is for Tol Barad to function like Wintergrasp with regard to your questions. So it will be a PvP zone at all times and flight will be disabled once the battle begins.<br />

<br />
<br />
they need to work on the balancing of WG more. Im horde on area 52 us server and according to archavon logs the horde have been able to defend over 1200 times and alliance have defended wg only 6 times ever. yes 6 times ever they have defended the keep when they controlled it. they can usually take control around 3-5am one time only.<br />
<br />
it is usually 120 horde vs 10 alliance during the day and max cap for tenacity is 20 and even then we easily just roll over them and 4 minutes into the battle control 24 catapults firing at there farmed gy waiting for anyone to try and run away from there safety gy to get nuked.<br />
<br />
yes as a horde it makes winning easy but winning easy and all the time like that is boring without actually having to try</div></div><hr />

Are they forgetting that it's supposed to be a quel'danas like pvp zone when the battle is not going on? (and here we have the problem of the separation of EU and US servers: I can't ask that question directly on the us forum)<br />
<br />
Also I didn't think of this bloody queue. It will force a bunch of people off the place when the battle starts, which makes me think that trying to combine the wintergrasp and quel'danas concepts in the same place is a bad idea. They should make a spearate quel'danas like daily quest hub, there's no value in it being in tol barad.<br />
<br />
The quest hub shutting off every few hours is just going to be an annoyance and will make the place less attractive because people will always wonder if they have enough time to complete their dailies before the battle starts.</div></div><hr />

And that main reason is they want to be able to quest, farm mats, raid Ect. without always being griefed by other players. Please Blizz reconsider, as the game is now I never have to pvp unless I que for a BG or go to wintergrasp. But looks like in Cata if i want to enjoy the new dailys then ill be forced into a pvp environment. not cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it won't. The ease of getting PvE gear due to readily available PuG raids will still far outweigh the ability to easily get into one world pvp arena. I was on Nagrand, have moved most of my play to Thaurissan, and the economy and raid scene on Thaurissan are unbelievably much better (due to its much higher Horde-side population). I'd hate for that to go away just because of Tol Barad, luckily I don't think it will.</div></div><hr />

I reckon Tol Barad will also have a form of hidden balancing like WG does right now, meaning if one faction loses several times, they get bonuses to help them capture.</div></div><hr />

Try looking at the details... if you can't see why that one is better coloured than yours, than that's why your artwork wasn't chosen: you're not an artist.<br />

<br />
Sounds fair enough to me. A handicap system is needed because it's entertainment (played by sometimes handicapped players :P ) not a sport. Fundamentally, it's for fun.<br />
<br />
Giving sizable bonuses for being the underpopulated faction on a server is a good start to evening things out. It's a good way to fight the economic/PvE network effect which currently gives an advantage to the most populated side. The next step would be to stop making the graphics more shiny and focusing on making the game work well with 50, 100, 200+ players on screen at once. It still takes a top end computer to handle WG without lagging a fair bit. I want to see more players per realm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
they need to work on the balancing of WG more. Im horde on area 52 us server and according to archavon logs the horde have been able to defend over 1200 times and alliance have defended wg only 6 times ever. yes 6 times ever they have defended the keep when they controlled it. they can usually take control around 3-5am one time only.<br />
<br />
it is usually 120 horde vs 10 alliance during the day and max cap for tenacity is 20 and even then we easily just roll over them and 4 minutes into the battle control 24 catapults firing at there farmed gy waiting for anyone to try and run away from there safety gy to get nuked.<br />
<br />
yes as a horde it makes winning easy but winning easy and all the time like that is boring without actually having to try<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a feeling you might not like this change quite as much if you're perma locked out of even doing Tol Barad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
'Cause black shadows make a drawing lol'inoright? First off, that night elf drawing is something drawn in less then 20 minutes for the sole sake of getting hits on Deviantart - or whatever art obsessed Facebook wannabe &quot;look at me love me hug me&quot; site they use. And yeah, it's better then yours. Of course they didn't use dark shadows, did you look at the style of their art? It's not intended to be dark and ominous, that's like complaining that there are no black shadows on a pink sunshine rainbow painting of happy time sunshine bear and claiming it's total fail because of it. And omg the background was done with a special brush! vs your background that was done with three swishes of a digital mouse...? k.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't want to defend the night elf drawing. Let's tear apart the little gem you linked with constructive criticism. Shadows =/= black, and light =/= white. You should have the colors of the surroundings be reflected in the colors of the objects. See how the night elf drawing uses a light cream as it's base skin ton, then a darker peach for shading. They also use tones of pink and yellow for reflecting light, there is no &quot;white&quot; the one line across the thigh and dot on the shoulder is a much lighter cream. Now imagine they had added black to it to cause shadows........it wouldn't work, it rarely works unless you're doing a harsh contrast in which case half the image should be black as well. You also need to learn how to color with a light source in mind. You have shadows around above and under her cleavage, and yet add highlights to indicate the light is coming from above. The chest is cock-eyed and unnatural, the color bone is too far to her left. Following the vertical line down the face, the forehead emblem is off. Her left eye is too far away from the bridge of her nose and tilted incorrectly (in comparison to the other eye, if you want the right eye can be wrong). Her right horn is completely misplaced....<br />
<br />
Things that can help you improve: From that one picture you posted, you seem to use a base color, then add black or white depending on if there's light hitting or a shadow casting. Remember skin is made of MULTIPLE colors. A pale human skin ton has cream, yellow, beige, BLUE, GREEN in it. It's there even if you don't see it. Plan your color palette before you start. Want your blue skinned draenei girl to be surrounded by mystic purple settings? Let it show in her skin and her armor. Practice knowing your shadows, get a lamp and some still life and observe how the light casts shadows in a dark room. Keep in mind if you stand in a dark room with a light over your head, that light will hit the floor and bounce back up creating a lesser light coming from below. Knowing how light and shadows work are what make work look real. Also ALWAYS flip your artwork horizontally, everything you thought was perfectly aligned suddenly looks horribly off when you do. If everything is correct however, it'll still look picture perfect. :P<br />

Why the hell have an outdoor pvp area when they are treating it like a battleground anyway, trying to balance it by teleporting people in and out?! And if the conclusion then is &quot;you can't have an outdoor area without that or one side would dominate&quot; then the conclusion is YOU CAN'T have an outdoor area at all!

<br />
<br />
they need to work on the balancing of WG more. Im horde on area 52 us server and according to archavon logs the horde have been able to defend over 1200 times and alliance have defended wg only 6 times ever. yes 6 times ever they have defended the keep when they controlled it. they can usually take control around 3-5am one time only.<br />
<br />
it is usually 120 horde vs 10 alliance during the day and max cap for tenacity is 20 and even then we easily just roll over them and 4 minutes into the battle control 24 catapults firing at there farmed gy waiting for anyone to try and run away from there safety gy to get nuked.<br />
<br />
yes as a horde it makes winning easy but winning easy and all the time like that is boring without actually having to try<br />
<br />
<br />
ya thats why i left that sever now i'm on winterhoof. i like to see a 50/50 but that will never happen.</div></div><hr />

Ah, but we women know the natural proportions of said tits, and therefore a woman's drawing of tits looks more natural.<br />
<br />
I showed some of my comics to a friend while I was at university ten years ago and he said that he honestly liked my drawings of women because they weren't completely pneumatic.<br />

I wish I could draw even as well as Sorayiel, my handiwork is mostly political cartoons based on anthropomorphy, therianthropy (the theory of animal spirits being incarnated in human bodies) and my main character is a fox based on David Cameron; I'm not in the furry business exactly but any expression of art gets my vote (pun sort of intended).<br />

You call that hentai? Please. I'd call it art. And who cares if it's manga-style, comic-style or real life-style? Most guys will still drool over boobies, including me, but hey, that's how guys roll. If a guy denies that, he's just either homosexual, tired of &quot;doin' it&quot; or just doesn't appreciate that kind of art. Really, I don't see people complaining about real-life style naked art, how is manga-style any different? <br />
<br />
People pretend to be so high above others sometimes that it just plainly makes me kinda nauseous.<br />

I was more talking about the fact that everyone in this thread is talking about the hentai VERSION of that exact same fan-art.<br />
<br />
The one posted by Boubouille is fine and i accept that.<br />

The problem is when the majority of the people here would RATHER look at a hentai version of a piece of art, then actually go after the real thing.<br />
<br />
It gets pretty boring seeing posts like &quot;I'D TOTALLY HIT THAT ZOMGOMG&quot; when, in reality, they would blush and act all shy when talking to ANY kind of girl in real life.<br />

In all honesty, it really doesn't look very Shamanistic despite being named a Draenei &quot;Shaman&quot;. Looks like any regular female Draenei, or at the very least a Mage due to the purple background (which looks arcanely to me). :-\<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
On Topic however, I'm really looking forward to the Cata Screenies every day but a tad disappointed about Tol'Barad review. They claim they wanted it like Isle of Quel'Danas, yet what separates Tol'Barad from Quel'danas is they're still allowing flying mounts outside of the battle, which basically ruins any proper PvP. <br />
<br />
Remove the luxury of flying mounts at Tol'Barad or give items which can dismount people who are flying, otherwise any PvP outside of the proper battle event will be as scarce as Wintergrasp is today.<br />
<br />
Also... I hope they arent following the idea of having one capturable base on the Isle of Tol'Barad which gives yet another VoA. Id much rather it have 2 bases, one for each faction and have us go at war with one another, then maybe have a capturable base in the center of the map which would supply extra PvP daily's and quests for the side who controls is. Something like what Halaa was, allowing people to hand in those fragments from mobs in Nagrand (though to a much larger extent with proper quests, not all repeatable ones).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think anyone actually ever &quot;drools&quot; but the expression means to just find a woman very attractive. I am sorry you have never experienced this. Must be a lot of ugly women where you are from? Probably from Europe somewhere. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy your ban for flaming europe.<br />
<br />
But to answer your question... sure i find many woman attractive and yes, woman do appreciate being noticed for their sexual appeal...<br />
<br />
The difference is being noticed for it, and being screamed at saying &quot;ZOMG ID HIT THAT SO HARD&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is a line, and when you cross it, you either look like an idiot (as per many people in this thread) or get done for sexual harrassment.<br />
<br />
Learn to appreciate woman more and maybe, just maybe, you will actually find someone to spend your life with instead of proclaming how much you want to have sex with a cartoon character.</div></div><hr />

I do not find any type of drawn image to be arousing at all. Either by hand or computer. It's not real. It doesn't matter how big they draw them or how round they make the curves. It's fake. I can appreciate art. I can admit when something is nicely drawn or a well taken picture. Just because it has nudity in it doesn't mean I'll be drooling over then run into the bathroom. <br />

This.<br />
<br />
You don't see people in art galaries jacking off to naked art drawings.<br />
<br />
And on the flip side, you certainly don't see women fudding themselves silly whilst looking at the Statue of David.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, there is a problem with your logic. Guys do go around thinking &quot;OMG ID SO HIT THAT&quot;...but honestly, NOBODY sane ever actually says it to a woman. If anything guys say it in their head or to one of their buddies. You might not agree with it, but finding someone attractive just by looks and having only sexual chemistry....there is nothing wrong with that. You can argue all you want, but that is still a type of appreciation. <br />
<br />
<br />
So you believe the entirity of Europe is gay simply because A) I've reported you &amp; B) Because not EVERYONE screams out how much they want to &quot;HIT DAT&quot; at every girl they see?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one posted by Boubouille is fine and i accept that.<br />
<br />
The problem is when the majority of the people here would RATHER look at a hentai version of a piece of art, then actually go after the real thing.<br />
<br />
It gets pretty boring seeing posts like &quot;I'D TOTALLY HIT THAT ZOMGOMG&quot; when, in reality, they would blush and act all shy when talking to ANY kind of girl in real life.<br />
<br />
But hey, if pointing out the obvious makes me a &quot;homosexual asshole&quot;... then i guess i am.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, to some extend, with you, but you are assuming things that are not right at all. To make it clearer, I will make an example about teenage girls. Those who drool at daydream about those young musicians, actors, etc. and keep the covers of those teen magazines are, usually, shy in front of men aswell. They rather* drool at some guy that they will never meet instead of going for the &quot;real thing&quot;. <br />
<br />
What now? Exactly the same on both sides with the difference that it's typical that a man will make this public, while a woman may be a bit more conservative in the topic. That's why in any place where you can find comments and there's a girl involved (From youtube videos to mmo-champion thread about some new Wintergrasp area) you see people saying &quot;I'd totally hit that&quot; which means &quot;I think this girl is very attractive and as a man I am, I'm making this public&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's it, really. Yes, comments of that kind may be boring, but, it's a way that a man has to express himself. It has NOTHING to do with being shy with girls, appreciate them, etc.<br />
I can totally love my girl, but, in company of other men, if a hot girl passes, a comment or a gesture will go by. I don't even look at that girl, but it's more of a social (and animal) thing.<br />
<br />
I personally don't find hentai arousing, but I have no troubles saying that female Humans and female Blood Elves are attractive, because they are modelled to be attractive. Some people will find female Night Elves more attractive, a bit about taste, but come on, ask a girl why she rolled a Blood Elf. &quot;Because they look beatiful/hot/whatever&quot;.</div></div><hr />

When I said that guys drool over &quot;naked women&quot; of any kind then I didn't actually mean doing it... for real, you know. I mean in your head. Like thinking someone is beautiful, or &quot;hot&quot;. And just because women have bigger curves doesn't mean they're more attractive... right?<br />
<br />
I mean, surely you've also considered drawn women &quot;pretty&quot; at some point, without having any sexual thoughts behind it? I mean, that's what people think of art. People can think stuff is pretty, beautiful or &quot;cool&quot; without it being real, right?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm giving off different explanations each time I post, sorry for that. But I really think people act so insecure about their sexuality sometimes, it's kind of strange. I dunno, really.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ikkatsu</div><div class="date">2010-04-30, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh...I swear...nobody can be this stupid. First of all, good job at butchering the English language with attempting to pluralize &quot;Gallery&quot;. My niece in 3rd grade is clearly smarter then you are. Second, art in a gallery like you speak of is not drawn for fan service or to look attractive. You can't tell someone what they can or cannot find attractive. Obviously there are enough people in the world to like hentai to keep it around all this time, just because you do not like it or find appeal it in...doesn't mean someone else can't. I am indifferent towards it, but I am not close minded like you to sit around telling people it is impossible to find any kind of attractiveness in it. <br />
<br />
I'd love to see the vision of a world in your eyes. I bet everyone would all wear the same clothes, one color, one style. Everyone would listen to the same music, study the same culture, eat the same food everyday and like the same thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
The difference is, im talking about the people that actually masterbate to stuff like this. They do exist and i would bet a good majority of the people posting &quot;Id Hit That&quot; in this thread are part of the demographic.<br />
<br />
I've already said i don't care if people proclaim they find it attractive... its when you know that the reason they took so long to post it in the first place was because they had their hand down their pants and was typing with one hand.<br />
<br />
I personally find the new Dark Ranger model of Sylvanas very attractive (something i've been trying to get my girlfriend to dress up as for some time... minus the fact that she is a rotting corpse [Sylvanas... not my Girlfriend]).<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean im going to beat off to it every time i walk past in Undercity though.<br />

Pretty? No. Well drawn, yes. See I find women, flesh and blood pretty. But, probably because we have different opinions. For me, I can never find drawn pictures attractive. I just can't. I'm not saying people don't. But, what I dislike are those that are like &quot;ZOMG this pix iz so hawt! I whack to hentai!&quot; If a person does it, so be it.

Well, I do respect your opinion, and you aren't judgmental towards people who do find drawn women &quot;attractive&quot;. I respect that. I mean, I do sometimes. Not the &quot;hentai&quot;-type though. I mean the more &quot;artsy&quot;-type that focuses more on the beauty of art more than sexual... things. That's just kinda gross, which means yes, I do agree with you that people who go &quot;ZOMG HENTAI I MUST WHACK&quot; are kind of... weird? Well, it's their free time, right? :P<br />
<br />
Well, enough about that. There are probably better things to discuss than the fact that people have different opinions about what's hot/beautiful/well-drawn and what's not.<br />

Death Knights were evil, but they were made &quot;good&quot; :) (Crosses fingers for Naga as playable race in the future)</div></div><hr />

THIS picture was not accepted by Blizzard a while back, but this pretty Night Elf artwork is? And imo the Tauren artwork looks a lot better than the Night Elf.<br />
<br />
PS. I don't know why everyone's talking about the Night Elf anyway. The Abominaton vs. Naga is SO much cooler.</div></div><hr />

they decide... so... i dont think there is a point in debating how they judge fan art unless they are going to - remove the actual accepted image ( why? ) . put the tauren female image ( because you told em to do so? :))</div></div><hr />

<br />
I looked at your Deviant art drawings and they are far from better,but not worse either.They are simply different art styles and each person has their own tastes in art.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the pic of the day one is a more professional look to it compared to yours which are bit rougher looking.Still good work just differing styles.<br />
<br />
So let go of the ego and just enjoy the pics.<br />
<br />
Agreed. It's difficult to compare 2 different styles of art. People can have a preference, but your art is good for sure, no reason for anyone to be bashing you for anything.</div></div><hr />

That's because Melissa O'Brien had submitted several other pieces of artwork already. In the interest of balance they only accept a couple submissions from each person. Otherwise the gallery would be flooded by overzealous artists who want to use the warcraft gallery as their personal portfolio.</div></div><hr />

Well, probably because it would appear to be vaguely sexualizing an animal or animal-like creature, which is typically viewed as rather perverse in general society (as would be for &quot;androids&quot;, children, etc). <br />
<br />
Not that I disagree about the &quot;druid&quot; they accepted being cheap and valueless faux-art... which it is.</div></div><hr />

But the Nelf pic got accepted even though she's barely wearing anything?<br />

Aaaah this makes a lot more sense to me now, thank you. Doesn't mean the original Nelf picture pisses me off less though.<br />

True, but Blizzard should know all too well about sexualising characters already. Because they're perverts. And think we all are too... even though a majority of us actually are it seems, by skimming through other posts on this topic. *Sigh*<br />
