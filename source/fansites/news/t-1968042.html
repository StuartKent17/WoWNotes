Why should they announce a games release date before their event dates? They rarely have done with past Blizzcons or are you just looking to complain? I mean they can if they want but they don't nor would it be better or worse for them to. I mean I highly doubt Legion or it's pre launch is gonna be delayed till November.</div></div><hr />

Legally, Blizzard isn't able to release it past September 21st. So, even if they would take 6 more months to work on Legion, it would never reach November, because it can't. Great prediction. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

They haven't guaranteed September. They wrote expected.<br />

Quote:<br />

Pre-purchase: Game is expected to release on or before September 21, 2016.<br />
Pre-purchasing Legion grants early access to the new Demon Hunter class prior to the expansion’s release.</div></div><hr />

It says &quot;expected&quot; not guaranteed. It's their little loophole of changing it whenever they want.</div></div><hr />

Rofl, please don't tell me you're thinking you can use this as some sort of &quot;excuse&quot; to &quot;force&quot; Blizzard to release their game. They'll release it when they're ready, whether that's September 21st, July 4th, December 31st, or June 2018. Release dates change all the time, and there is no legal obligation whatsoever for them to release it on or before September 31st just because their ad says so. <br />
<br />
When I see a &quot;now hiring&quot; ad in a newspaper from 3 years ago, I don't get upset or try to sue the company because they are no longer hiring. Same concept applies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They DID try to start faster expansions in the current expansion. Why do you think there were no real content rich patches in WoD and only two raid tiers?<br />
<br />
Blizzard just stated late last year they are no longer shooting for faster/annual expansion launches again after the debacle that was Warlords of Draenor. They stated they want to go back to the normal multi-patch cycles like we saw in Wrath and early in MoP.<br />
<br />
Now they only said they 'wanted' to do this. 'Want' does not mean Blizzard will do something.<br />
<br />
Falling all over themselves to rush out WoD and then trying to rush out Legion while going back and forth leaving WoD to whither and rushing back to give it life support was the entire problem with WoD. Just let them focus on getting back on track and do not expect the next expansion announcement at this year's Blizzcon. That would be AWFUL news for Legion.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon is always very good, and it's a major bummer when they skip years. I love the event, the news on games, the tournaments (especially Hearthstone). <br />
<br />
I also think it's silly to assume anything on a wow release date for this. Blizzcon is on the same date every year that is's on +/- a week or two.</div></div><hr />

This might shock you, but Blizzcon will become less and less about WoW as time goes on. HS, OW and the more plug and play games will get more and more attention. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

That means nothing. They could just say &quot;oops&quot; and dealy the launch for another 2 years if they so pleased. No legal consequences at all. It would mean the death of the game though, but that's mere details.<br />

<br />
So, November most likely<br />
<br />
They need to plan on each expansion being two years and then spread the patches out more. In MoP, we had some rapid fire patches- too fast and then a giant lul at the end. So much so, that they cut out patch dungeons altogether to push those patches out faster. The results were- no new dungeons past launch in MoP, good raiding guilds raiding twice a week not having enough time to finish previous raiding tiers before the next one dropped, and then the infamous year long drought that was SoO.<br />
<br />
In WoD, they stupidly just decided to gut the living hell out of almost ALL content and decided they would just reuse everything they had at launch. Tanaan Jungle was delayed to make it look like a patch, Shattrath and Farahlon were cut, capital cities were changed to simpler Ashran locations, and they cut raiding down to two tiers. The result? An even LONGER drought between expansions. Sure, they are coming out closer- 1.5 - 1.75 years apart. But in the meantime, most of us rightfully felt incredibly ripped off financially by spending upwards of $200 to play a barebones WoD for one year.<br />
<br />
Two year planning would allow them to slow down, focus on releasing patches every 16 weeks or so and give us patches with more content than ever. Quality, quantity, and player stability would return.</div></div><hr />

There should be since they were just hiring for a &quot;new diablo project&quot; like under a month ago.<br />

Interestingly enough, this is what shows up when you go to book a hotel from the blizzcon site which says 6th and 7th of November of 2016 which would oddly be a Sunday/Monday:<br />

It'll be murloc related. Giant murloc mount? Or possibly just another mount with a murloc riding on it like the Polar Bear.<br />

Interestingly enough, this is what shows up when you go to book a hotel from the blizzcon site which says 6th and 7th of November of 2016 which would oddly be a Sunday/Monday:<br />

Exactly. If they release after that date they have broken a ton of laws in a lot of countries.<br />

The date says expected not guaranteed. They can go past it if they want as it's a smart loophole. There is no requirement to release it on or before Sep 21st it just says EXPECTED. They can't however do the same with Overwatch now as that has a guaranteed date set in stone unless there is a really big issue that would delay it's release.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they would release after the release date even if, like you say, they don't have any legal reason that forces them to do so. I think the expected date is here so ppl can cancel their pre-order when the date is passed, maybe?</div></div><hr />

There isn't any legal reason because like I said they were clever and put EXPECTED which in 0 way means guaranteed. But yeah I can imagine it would annoy people if they didn't. It's the same thing with wow when people think they &quot;promise&quot; content then throw a temper tantrum if even a tiny piece gets cut.</div></div><hr />

While this is true and LEGALLY they are not obligated due to the wording of the sentence, Blizzard has yet to ever go past their &quot;expected&quot; deadlines, in fact they have always been roughly ~4 weeks earlier than it. If they did go past that date, holy hell would people raise a storm, and Blizzard knows that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the legality of the release date is this: it is not a binding contract, therefore you are not able to sue them since it breaks no actual laws. You can file grievance if you are a shareholder :D but you won't get a free copy or anything of that nature. There would just be some back end money deals that would get messed up and a whole lot of non-public ramifications. However, it is a tentative release date that most companies give out. This is the first time that Blizzard has gave one out for WoW publicly. I will be very impressed if they get it out before then, because I have faith they can do it. Also the progress with the Alpha seems to be on task from previous expansions.</div></div><hr />

Uhm WoD was scheduled for December and came out November so no it's not the first time. Also Overwatch was scheduled for June now has a street date of May. Pretty much all of their products they've given an &quot;expected&quot; date on have arrived at least a month or two early. LoTV and Heroes being another two.</div></div><hr />

Do you really think beta is going to be the same as it has been? That's what 'Alpha' is now. They've already done raid testing, beta is going to be nothing more than a stress test, almost guaranteed.<br />

This isn't a leak. They updated the Blizzcon website, then maybe 20 or 30 minutes later reverted the update. A leak would be telling everyone we knew that Blizzcon is going to be on those dates without any website update.</div></div><hr />

There's no legal basis to prevent them from moving the release date, if they need to.<br />

They HAVE to have something big this year. 10th Blizzcon and 25th Anniversary of Blizzard as a company? Perfect time to blow the roof off the place with a new Warcraft (non WoW) announcement.<br />
<br />
Maybe. Or they'll simply use the opening ceremony - which is what you're talking about - to make a presentation about the company, it's history, it's people, and it's products. Show off the movie, and the Chronicles book (which is very good, just started reading it yesterday) The real focus will be on the panels - &quot;Where to next&quot; with legion, something for Diablo, Hearthstone expansion, etc. Overwatch will get a lot of love. Maybe announce Chronicles #2. Or the next Warcraft movie. (If there is going to be one.) <br />
<br />
Announcing Legion at Gamescon says to me they're not married to &quot;Announce everything at Blizzcon&quot; anymore.<br />

<br />
I haven't been following the Alpha stuff, so let me ask - are all of the 5 mans tested? Is the majority of questing playable, and being tested? Are all of the regions open, populated with mobs and quests? That's the kind of thing the beta will involve, if it's anything like previous betas. I was in the TBC beta, and I spent most of my time trying out the questing, and giving feedback on it. Stress testing is definitely part of the process, but it's a little more involved than that. <br />
<br />
Considering they're still working on talents, I'd say they're going to want a serious period of actual *playing* with them in the beta, before they release it.</div></div><hr />
