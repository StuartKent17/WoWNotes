Warcraft Movie Footage<br />
Even more Warcraft movie footage has been released, with some new scenes.

Patch 6.2.4 Hotfixes - May 24: Leveling Hotfixes<br />
Note from the developers:<br />
<br />
Over the past couple of weeks, we’ve rolled out a series of hotfixes aimed at improving overall pacing and playability of the low-level (1-20) experience. We started by adding a number of modern conveniences to our low-level quest experience, and will continue to roll these improvements forward across other legacy content in the future. We’ve also made some improvements to the overall pace of combat at low levels: Due to the accumulated effect of years’ worth of max-level tuning adjustments, many classes were killing low-level enemies nearly instantaneously, even without heirloom gear or other advantages. A summary of the hotfixes follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
Most quest bosses from level 1-20 should now be multitap and will scale their health with the numbers of players fighting them.<br />
Added dynamic respawn behavior to most level 1-20 outdoor areas, so that spawns will be more readily available during times of high player traffic.<br />
Players who die in low-level dungeons should now release to the entrance of the dungeon, consistent with the practice in dungeons from more recent expansions.<br />
Level 1-10 enemy NPCs now deal slightly more damage.<br />
Reduced the bonus to out-of-combat health regeneration that players receive when below level 20.<br />
Reduced player damage at low levels to improve overall combat pacing. In general, Strength and Agility classes saw a larger reduction in damage than did casters. Damage dealt is unchanged from level 40 onwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
We see these changes as the beginning, rather than an endpoint – much work remains to improve tuning and pacing of the old-world level-up experience, and our efforts will continue into Legion and beyond.<br />
<br />

PvP<br />
How many prestige ranks are there? And do they increase in amount needed per level for the next rank?<br />
At launch there will be 4 Prestige Ranks and additional ranks will be added each season. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732677374177775616))<br />
<br />
in #legion pvp will secondary stats be normalized too? If I want to do a mastery build in pvp will it just get flattened out?<br />
Correct. The secondary stats on your gear will not matter in PvP instances. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/732677265494970368))<br />

You didn't call anything. Look at reviews from people who play the game and know the lore, they are loving it. It is always going to be opinion based but you've already made your decision that you don't like it.</div></div><hr />

Except fans totally loved it. There are reviews from European critics and they are lot more positive.<br />
Then again, &quot;a video game movie will suck&quot; doesn't lead to a good review.</div></div><hr />

It seems like a perfect timing. They expect an influx of new players due to the upcoming movie and expansion.<br />
<br />
Now let's just hope the 1st few reviews we have seen weren't representative of the actual movie-goer-crowd and it actualy turns out good.</div></div><hr />

Just logged in as Horde, then Alliance - got both sets.<br />

I think the first Horde toon you log into gets the Horde items and the first Alliance toon gets the Alliance items. You wouldn't be able to mail them cross faction, I think, because you can't use them cross faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the same front a few critics hating it doesn't make it bad. The few critics who have written it are opposite of the reactions we are getting from the France screening. It's not flopping at all, its not even released to be a flop. Considering most of the critics panning it keep comparing it to WoW and not Warcraft 1 or are asking why the Orcs dont look like LotR orcs makes me feel like some people are hopping on the bandwagon, yourself included. Regardless we'll all know more when it actually releases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I only could use the Ally transmog on my Human Paladin tank. Does not really fit my Draenei Warrior or anybody else. Don't see my NE Rogue running around with 2 such swords, either. But for Horde, I only got some use of the axe on my Orc Rogue, and the staff went to my Troll Mage, I will probably build a transmog around it. She is a wicked &quot;witch&quot; of some kind, even though she does not summon demons. :D</div></div><hr />

Just mailed them from a horde character to my alliance character on another server, works fine. Using them for transmog is another thing though, havn't tested that.</div></div><hr />

Not true. As long as you have the achievement, you'll get it in the Transmog wardrobe come the patch. You just miss out on the box.<br />

Well I called it, the movie sucks. Reviews are coming out, it's a flop. Kotaku also has an article up right now about how shitty it is.<br />
<br />
A 'flop' is a financial loss on the movie, not a critical loss. See: Batman vs. Superman for a clear example of that distinction.<br />
<br />
See: Blade Runner as a flop that critics loved.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cavox</div><div class="date">2016-05-25, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My personal WoW leveling wishlist:<br />
<br />
- make leveling harder<br />
- make group quests require finding a group (again)<br />
- lower the experience gain ratio so I don't outlevel a zone I just entered after doing 1/3rd of it's quests.<br />
- make LFD experience lower, so questing is a viable alternative<br />
- make leveling an adventure again, not a chore of spaming LFD in a city<br />
<br />
I see Blizzard notices the problem, but I doubt a few tweaks can fix the leveling experience as it is. It needs an overhaul.<br />

About Warcraft movie:<br />
Most critics don't play or like vidya, they rate movies like Boyhood 100/100, so... yeah. Just watch the movie yourselves. Even if it turns out shit, you only lost like a worth of a pizza.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, according to critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Gravity is one of the best movies ever made, but I thing it's it probably the worse thing made in the last 15 years, with horrible acting, terrible script...</div></div><hr />

They make movies based on revenue, not reviews. Tons of movies with bad reviews have been hugely successful.<br />

DJ is a &quot;critics darling&quot; who did a few critically well received indie movies - none which are anything to talk about commercially.<br />

MB is critically a joke but he is still working because he brings in the crowds (along with them, their money) with his brain dead movies.<br />

<br />
- make leveling harder<br />
- make group quests require finding a group (again)<br />
- lower the experience gain ratio so I don't outlevel a zone I just entered after doing 1/3rd of it's quests.<br />
- make LFD experience lower, so questing is a viable alternative<br />
- make leveling an adventure again, not a chore of spaming LFD in a city<br />
<br />
I see Blizzard notices the problem, but I doubt a few tweaks can fix the leveling experience as it is. It needs an overhaul.<br />

Watching people grasp at &quot;It's only 5 reviews&quot; are like the bernie supporters seeing 90% for clinton after a few precincts reporting in and hoping it will change. The first 5 have it at 40. More people reviewing doesn't mean it's going to go to 99%. It could drop further and most likely will. If warcraft fans are saying meh the general population are going to start calling it a shitty lord of the rings ripoff.</div></div><hr />

I find it funny that Alonso Duralde says this about the Warcraft Movie &quot;Imagine Battlefield Earth without the verve, or the unintentional comedy.&quot; <br />

First, 40% based on only five reviews. You understand that the RT score is just the current percentage of reviews that are considered positive, right? If it winds up with a dozen 1/10 scores and two dozen 6/10 scores it'll still get rated 67% fresh.<br />
<br />
Second, Age of Extinction has an 18% on RT and they've got like three more Transformers movies scheduled through 2018. Hell, Clash of the Titans, which was also made by Legendary and has a similar budget, has a 28% on RT and it got a sequel.<br />

<br />
That's 100% honestly, the WORST movie I have ever seen. The actors gave of a awkward vibe even after the editing, I'd love to know how bad it was prior. Bad actors, given a stupid script that just totally disregarded a 40 year old series - and this guy thinks it's good? <br />
<br />
Someone should get in contact, their critic is broken. I guess Blizzard didn't include money with their press showings, because DBZ:Evo must of to get a good review from anyone. I don't trust critics, Reviews or youtubers for their opinions, as most of the time the good is bought and the bad is not. I trust only my own opinion on things, that's how everyone should be.<br />
<br />
There's one massive flaw I've noticed from Warcraft, and that's the INSANELY over the top advertising. I genuinely feel like I've already seen half the movie... They went way to far, and they don't appear to be stopping with the releases of clips. I'm also getting a sense of cheesy cringe from it, which concerns me... But I'm willing to give it a shot and make my own mind up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 'flop' is a financial loss on the movie, not a critical loss. See: Batman vs. Superman for a clear example of that distinction.<br />
<br />
See: Blade Runner as a flop that critics loved.<br />
<br />
There are tons of movies that &quot;flopped&quot; at the box office, but made huge profits running on tons of screens, and then sold a ton in rentals, streaming, and cable rights. Blade Runner has more than paid for itself many times over with rereleases and VHS/DVD/BR sales, and cable sales. I'm pretty sure the Big Lebowski went unnoticed in the theater, but blew up later as a cult classic. <br />
<br />
Warcraft will make it's money back, no matter what. It may not be a box office hit - and for money, that's not that important.<br />
<br />
&quot;Box office hit!&quot; is a marketing thing, anyway - it just sells more tickets if it sells tons the first weekend. If they get the movie on enough screens, for enough time, it will profit. It will have do really poorly, like selling 10% of available tickets a week after release, for it to fail.<br />

<br />
It's all on Universal and whatever agency they hired, and whoever was green lighting the marketing campaign. In the movie industry...that can change in the blink of an eye - and the people in charge can be people unqualified to be doing it. You'd think Universal would know better, but some kid is probably calling the shots, someone's nephew, or someone who blew all kinds of dubstep fairy dust up the exec's skirts about &quot;reaching the kids&quot;. <br />
<br />
Every aspect of movie making is political - and trailers are not immune. The people who did the trailers for Warcraft don't get the genre, and have been trying to sell the movie as an action/adventure movie. And the sick thing is, they'll get hired to make more - and get paid a lot of money to do it. It's been a completely wasted opportunity, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Especially with the fact that Metacritic has 10 Cloverfield Lane as a 76 which I thought was a complete waste of time, extremely predictable, and overall garbage, yet they're praising it as suspenseful...<br />
<br />
So you'd take the word of someone biased over a neutral party? You just want to hear things that support your view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I want to hear the views of someone like me who's going into the theater, not someone who's looking for the next culture changing movie.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget the Cloverfield part. Seems like you're just picking parts of a post to support your view.</div></div><hr />

Batman V Superman and X-Men Apocalypse were both given bad and mixed reviews negatively, and I thought both were great films. Make up your own mind instead of listening to someone else's opinion. <br />
<br />
They're no different to ordinary people, they're just paid to scream the loudest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most of the Resident Evil movies were given terrible reviews. but the fanbase made sure more were made.<br />
I suspect the same will happen with WOW. there's a snobbery with most film Critics on Game/film movies. <br />
some of the comparisons made with other franchises as I posted earlier like Game of thrones etc. proves they haven't got a clue</div></div><hr />

You don't even know what a flop is. Go educate yourself and then come here to comment. Jesus Christ with all those r..tards that have an opinion without even seeing the movie</div></div><hr />

You sound really mad that people aren't liking the movie based on the game you spend your life wrapped around. You'll get over it. Sucks there won't be a sequel though so you best appreciate this one.</div></div><hr />

So... first it's a flop based on less than ten reviews, and now you're sure there won't be a sequel...<br />
<br />
Are you always this premature?</div></div><hr />

The actors gave of a awkward vibe even after the editing, I'd love to know how bad it was prior. Bad actors, given a stupid script that just totally disregarded a 40 year old series - and this guy thinks it's good? <br />
<br />
Someone should get in contact, their critic is broken. I guess Blizzard didn't include money with their press showings, because DBZ:Evo must of to get a good review from anyone. I don't trust critics, Reviews or youtubers for their opinions, as most of the time the good is bought and the bad is not. I trust only my own opinion on things, that's how everyone should be.<br />
<br />
There's one massive flaw I've noticed from Warcraft, and that's the INSANELY over the top advertising. I genuinely feel like I've already seen half the movie... They went way to far, and they don't appear to be stopping with the releases of clips. I'm also getting a sense of cheesy cringe from it, which concerns me... But I'm willing to give it a shot and make my own mind up.<br />
<br />
They've always done this. They always spend a fuck ton on advertising. More than any other game I know. I wonder what their budget is compared to old school Hasbro commercials.<br />
<br />
I'm curious about why people are so defensive about critics and the movie. If you haven't seen it and yet are trying to defend it -- that's just.. odd to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because people who also haven't seen it are going out of their way to slam it? Does that also strike you as odd?<br />
<br />
I haven't seen anyone defend it on unseen merit, either. Mostly just 'see it before you call it crap' and 'it's too soon to say it flopped'. Both of which seem reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but they're not the people posting here to slam it and declare it a flop before it's even released to the general public.</div></div><hr />

I'm 13/13 mythic. I don't want these changes. It seems you're confusing challenge with tedium. It happens a lot.</div></div><hr />

Major difference between it being painstakingly slow and challenging. These changes haven't made it more challenging whatsoever.</div></div><hr />
