Well, that's just the beauty of living on Azeroth; There's ALWAYS a worldshattering threat around the corner, being an Azerothian Doomsayer is a busy job!</div></div><hr />

Not only that, but Dalaran also has a lot more guards and several Exodar npc's like civilians, citizens and paladins have moved to Dalaran and are talking about &quot;a glimmer of hope&quot;. This combined with the end of the pvp season, makes me think that 7.3 is a lot closer than we thought.<br />

29th/30th August. Is is known. They just can't say it until few days before launch in case something would fuck up. Most probably trailer+date will be revealed around 23rd on Gamescom WoW panel.</div></div><hr />

Yes, after 4 times we can tell that 77 days is a pattern. Of course something bad can happen and they would have to delay it for week or two, but I don't think so. All patches so far were handled perfectly, even launch was very smooth.</div></div><hr />

It's been the amount of time between major content patches this expansion I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess a few earthquakes and altered landscapes are enough to warrant someone screaming the end is nigh.. Although I would say the Legion homeworld being right on the other side of a tear in the sky screams &quot; OMG we're fucked the end is nigh!!!! &quot; more than a giant angry dragon.</div></div><hr />
