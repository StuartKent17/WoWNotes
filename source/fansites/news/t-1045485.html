Post 4.3 Interview with Greg Street (Ghostcrawler)<br />
Blizzard was nice enough to let us talk to Ghostcrawler about his thoughts on Patch 4.3 now that it has been released and what the future has in store. We were even able to sneak in a few Mists of Pandaria questions for you!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/8MoL5hFhQH8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
In general, how well do you think Patch 4.3 went?<br />
We are pretty happy with it, as it was a huge patch for us. Large patches like this always come with a risk that we will screw something up, but it was a pretty smooth launch for as much content as we had in there.<br />
<br />
Are you happy with the difficulty of the Dragon Soul heroic encounters, or do you think the bosses are dying too fast?<br />
We are pretty happy with the current difficulty, the first boss is designed to be pretty easy, and the next tier of hardcore raiders are at the second or third boss, which is pretty much where we want them to be. The top tier guilds are going through it quickly, as they always do, but they make hundreds of attempts on each boss. Everyone is about where they should be right now.<br />
<br />
Recently you made it so that casters with shields can no longer roll on offhand items, but in previous tiers those items have been very competitive for those specs. Why was this changed?<br />
That's only in Raid Finder, and we made the change to restrict certain items to certain classes to prevent things like hunters needing on strength swords. We debated the offhand change a lot and we knew that some of the shaman might be unhappy with the fact that we are making them use the shield when they might want to use an offhand, but we also thought the mages, priests, and druids would be upset that the shaman got to roll on the offhand and the shield when they could only roll on the offhand. It could have gone either way and we understand that some players are upset at the way it went. Once players progress to normal mode, they can still use the offhands, so it is only a Raid Finder issue. <br />
<br />
You can easily max out Justice and Valor points right now, so do you plan on adding anything like pets, mounts, or vanity gear to provide some use for the points?<br />
We talked about it in the past, but we like the way it works now where players hit the cap quickly by doing whatever content they want. We don't want players to feel like they have to log in every night to earn as many Valor points as possible. <br />
<br />
Some guilds are doing up to 20 LFR runs in a week to maximize the amount of gear they can get...<br />
Yeah, fortunately that isn't very widespread. It is hard to discourage, and if they are enjoying it and it doesn't hurt game balance, we are okay with that. <br />
<br />
Is LFR going to remain a current raid only tool, or will we be able to use it from Dragon Soul onwards?<br />
Nope, we want to use it from Dragon Soul onwards. We would have loved to turn on LFR for all of the old content in the game, but Raid Finder was actually going to be a Patch 5.0+ feature. Fairly late we thought that it would be great to get into Patch 4.3, but up until the very end it wasn't clear if it would be ready for Patch 4.3. However, we were able to finish it in time with Dragon Soul functionality. If there is time in the future, we would like to go back and get at least some of the older content into it. <br />
<br />
Will there be another patch before Mists of Pandaria?<br />
We said that we are not going to do another tier of raiding content and PvP season, but we will do the normal pre expansion launch patch. This would include things like the new talents and the other big mechanics changes coming in the expansion, along with the launch event that deals with the Horde vs Alliance story and the introduction of the new continent. The launch event will be similar in magnitude to what we did for Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm brought us guild perks to make raiding easier like Mass Resurrection, Mass Summoning, and lower durability reduction on death. How high do you think the guild level is going to increase to in Mists of Pandaria and what kind of new guild perks do you think we will see?<br />
We aren't going to double the number of guild levels or anything like that. We had to make up for the lack of it in previous expansions this time around. Players can expect a few more levels, nothing like thirty or forty more. We haven't talked much about the perks guilds will receive yet, but they will be similar to the existing perks. One idea was cheaper transmogrification, which could be fun for players.<br />
<br />
Has there been any progress made on making items account bound and not server bound since you last commented on it?<br />
We would still love to do it, it isn't a design problem as much as a technical one. We are doing a lot of work to get achievements to be account wide, and it is possible that some of the work we do there will let us do the same thing for items. We can't promise anything though, because it could be the case that the first 90% of the work is really easy, and the last 10% is more difficult. Catching all of the exploits and bugs are part of what makes this something that is hard to do.<br />
<br />
Will the under construction parts of the Darkmoon Faire get filled out before Mists of Pandaria, or is this something that won't be done until later?<br />
We have vague plans, along the lines of &quot;Hey, we could add a haunted house here&quot;, but nothing solid. I would be surprised if it was expanded upon anytime soon, we might add something for the launch event. This depends on the players' reactions to the current one, if they feel like they are running out of things to do, or if there is a lot of love for certain minigames or parts of the Faire, we might be able to add something else. It is hard to provide enough content so that people never run out of things to do, so we are pacing ourselves with the Faire, expanding on it over time. <br />
<br />
Items from Archaeology have low item levels compared to the new and easy to access gear added in Patch 4.3, Are there any plans to scale or add new Archaeology items that will be relevant to the current content?<br />
We will likely add new items, we didn't want to compete with heirlooms and give alt characters more gear than they could possibly use, allowing them to level without caring at all about loot gained while leveling. We like the idea of artifacts remaining something that you can trade between characters on your account. If you get a healer trinket that you can't use right now because you don't have a healer, it could be something you use one day, rather than solving your healer trinket problems forever.<br />
<br />
With the advent of LFR, casual players can see all of the content, while Heroic raids seem to be harder now. Is this type of difficulty something you want to move forward doing?<br />
The advantage of having three difficulty levels is that we can tailor each one to the audience. Before LFR we could target Normal difficulty raids at organized guilds, which left nothing for PuGs to do, or we could target them at PuGs, making them too easy for organized guilds. This would leave normal guilds only Heroic difficulty for a challenging encounter, leaving nothing for the more hardcore guilds to do. The three difficulty levels let us tailor each difficulty so that everyone has something to do. <br />
<br />
Are there any plans to promote Voice Chat use?<br />
The Voice Chat we included is not a good feature. We tried, we made some mistakes, and we accept that it isn't something used by a lot of players. It is on the wishlist of things we would eventually like to improve. A big thing it is missing now that we would like to fix is the ability to communicate with people before you get into the game, having to be logged in to use it makes it less useful than something like Ventrilo or Mumble. <br />
<br />
Are you planning on adding chat channels for healing, DPS, and tanking in LFR?<br />
We haven't thought about it, but it wouldn't be hard to do. We would just add people to the channel based on their role. <br />
<br />
Okay, great. Thank you so much for your time!<br />
<br />

Winter Veil Changes<br />
Blizzard has made a few changes to Winter Veil this year, including making You're a Mean One... (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/6983/youre-a-mean-one/) into a group quest. <br />
<br />
He would be difficult to defeat on your own, but anyone in the area is allowed to loot the Stolen Treats (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/17662/stolen-treats/) after he is dead and free Metzen. Doing so will reward you with a Stolen Present (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/73792/stolen-present/), which can contain a number of things, including previous year's gifts, Lump of Coal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/73797/lump-of-coal/), and a Miniature Winter Veil Tree (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/66540/miniature-winter-veil-tree/).<br />

<br />
Yeah well F%&amp;^ that. 4.3 is the current patch, 4.3 is a terrible patch as it did nothing to fix the hugely obvious pvp imbalances, and in fact made them worse then before. A real Q and A should have asked about it. But this is just another PR department garbage Q and A that MMO-C puts up to get page views, and wouldnt dare to ask a real question because then they might get cut off from Blizzard's favor.</div></div><hr />

No, mostly due to how easily available the legendary is but in either case the off-hand that he's talking about is a spirit offhand, hence the comment.</div></div><hr />

Why not ask him about the downsides of the LFR and how it allows almost everyone to &quot;complete&quot; the game within a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Ask him how Blizzard intends to curb the downwards spiral which the game seems to be in at the moment.<br />
<br />
Ask him about his opinion on 15 man raids and if there's any chance we might see them anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Ask him about a 3rd pillar of endgame content that can coexist with Raids and Arena.<br />
<br />
Ask him to reflect on some of the design decisions made in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Ask him to react to some of the criticism directed at WoW.<br />

Now a PuG may not always get to the last boss or down it when they do, though prenerf PuGs from WotLK have been doing normal mode raids and getting more than half way in to full clears. Even a number of guilds cant get past the first few bosses in a raid while PuGs do. If Blizzard was talking about heroic modes than sure Ill agree with them about the need of a organized guild. It is the players who dont want to work together as a team that cannot do normal raids regardless of being in a guild or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any class balance question will be &quot;we'll try to fix it with Mists of Pandaria&quot;, it's not a bullshit answer, they're just redoing the whole talent system. There is absolutely no question to ask about that, we already know they're working on something new, we already know what it is, we already know the next step is beta testing. <br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler was nice enough to give us time for a post 4.3 interview and that's what we did, a post 4.3 interview. I'd be happy to get a Mists of Pandaria interview but this isn't the point and realistically it wouldn't be that interesting either since we got so much info from the Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
If you really wonder why we won't go to a developer and ask him &quot;SO HUH, YEAH, I KNOW YOU HATE ME AND WANT ME TO BE SAD FOR 2 SEASONS, WHY???&quot; I think you might want to try thinking about it again. Blizzard doesn't have a plan to steal your candies and make you sad. Really.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">good diu bro</div><div class="date">2011-12-17, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like they are going to dodge the &quot;reuse model for boss while having &quot;resources&quot; for new models on pet/mounts&quot; question and the rage directed on Thrallcraftism.<br />
But kudos to mmo-champion for getting yet another interview with blizz staff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will there be another patch before Mists of Pandaria?<br />
We said that we are not going to do another tier of raiding content and PvP season, but we will do the normal pre expansion launch patch. This would include things like the new talents and the other big mechanics changes coming in the expansion, along with the launch event that deals with the Horde vs Alliance story and the introduction of the new continent. The launch event will be similar in magnitude to what we did for Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not necessarily to be another tier/season, but filer contents are always nice to have. <br />
Maybe another Halion (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=39863/halion) like WotLK?<br />
Edit: Lich King was add in 3.3.2, Halion was add in 3.3.5 (around 3 months after LK), pre cata was in 4.0.1 (another 2-3 months after halion?)<br />
<br />
<br />
With the advent of LFR, casual players can see all of the content, while Heroic raids seem to be harder now. Is this type of difficulty something you want to move forward doing?<br />
The advantage of having three difficulty levels is that we can tailor each one to the audience. Before LFR we could target Normal difficulty raids at organized guilds, which left nothing for PuGs to do, or we could target them at PuGs, making them too easy for organized guilds. This would leave normal guilds only Heroic difficulty for a challenging encounter, leaving nothing for the more hardcore guilds to do. The three difficulty levels let us tailor each difficulty so that everyone has something to do. <br />
<br />
If compared to 4.0and 4.2 or perhaps with the Lich King, the progression of normal mode is a bit under-tuned in this tier.<br />
With LFR, maybe they can cater the casuals by giving them a bit more ego for showing their &quot;deathwing end&quot; title.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its obvious this fanart was drawn by males, and made for males.<br />
Hold on, are you talking about the kung-fu spewing pandas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, at least this finally rules out a patch 4.4.<br />
There simply is no content coming to warrant labeling such a filler patch as a major patch.<br />
4.3.5 at the most. Although I think we'll go straight from 4.3.2 to 5.0.1.<br />
The expansion sounds to be a lot closer than I first expected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think progression through 4.3 was easier than 4.2, i think it has to do with them really nerfing Firelands two months early, lots of people got access to heroic gear they never had before. So, of course their progression through normal mode 4.3 would be hastened.</div></div><hr />

The interview was exactly what it was advertised to be. You're expecting hard-hitting critical journalism in what was clearly a throw-away interview that he was being nice about doing in the first place? Jeez, people be crazy.</div></div><hr />

The content of the interview was very good and informative. The interviewer however threw it off. She sounded like a robot that didn't really care at all about the questions, and was just blasting through them. She sounded afraid of Greg and just wanted to hang up the phone the entire time. And then once all her questions were asked she immediately ends the interview with &quot;Welp, you answered all my questions. Thanks, bye!!&quot; There was so much more potential for that interview, he sounded like he wanted to talk a lot about his ideas and philosophy on where the game is headed but was never given the chance to continue talking.My advice is to get a couple of drinks in her before she does another interview. Have her do a shit ton of interviews to get more comfortable doing something like that. Her social anxiety was pouring through my computers speakers and it actually made me feel uncomfortable for her. Just relax a little! Greg Street is just a guy, not some vindictive god that will delete your characters or Wi flag your account. As much as people hate on him, he's actually pretty personable and someone you can have a great conversation with.</div></div><hr />

If you don't collect pets and aren't a rogue these won't mean much but they are new, at least.<br />
<br />
And seriously, is there a reason ALL the holiday weapons are rogue weapons? NOBODY but rogues use agility daggers, which we get for Christmas and Brewfest, nobody but rogues use agility swords(with expertise, so even hunters won't want them) which we got for Halloween, only the Brewfest mace is of use for anyone other than rogues(it's not bad for enhance shamans), though rogues still use them as well. For one holiday could we maybe get a staff, or a str weapon or something?</div></div><hr />

A post 4.3 interview where half the questions were already known and half focused on future features, like the LFR being used after the current tier, like is there another patch coming, like is Archaeology going to be made useful. But you wouldn't ask a question as to if they are going to fix whats currently broken or even acknowledge that it is broken. All these Q and As are completely pointless when you just softball in questions with obvious answers. <br />
<br />
The question I want one of you spineless sell outs to ask is why they leave classes like Warrior garbage, while leaving Mages overpowered, why they choose to make one class shit for almost an entire expansion, and the other overpowered? I want you to call them on their bullshit. But yeah I don't expect it.</div></div><hr />

Wow is dead to SOME people, but not a lot of people. To you maybe. I see SWTOR as just another Warhammer 40k. I tell the people who leave for it that i'll see them soon. I personally think 4.3 was neat and that Blizzard did a good job. Especially with the looks of the new gear! Warlock Tier is amazing. I'm not going to lie though, I look forward to Diablo 3.

Or my personal favourite, &quot;What class will the monk class be? Durrr!&quot;. Wasted opportunities gleefully thrown away by World of Warcraft's most convenient idiots when it comes to these questions. Don't expect them to be incriminating for two reasons;<br />
<br />
1) Most of the time, as aforementioned, it's an idiot asking them<br />
2) Blizzard cherry picks which questions they answer some of the other times; the truth is at times that i'm not entirely sure even they know what's going on with the game.</div></div><hr />

You could have had a way better discussion going.<br />
<br />
Why not ask him about the downsides of the LFR and how it allows almost everyone to &quot;complete&quot; the game within a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Ask him how Blizzard intends to curb the downwards spiral which the game seems to be in at the moment.<br />
<br />
Ask him about his opinion on 15 man raids and if there's any chance we might see them anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Ask him about a 3rd pillar of endgame content that can coexist with Raids and Arena.<br />
<br />
Ask him to reflect on some of the design decisions made in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Ask him to react to some of the criticism directed at WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
But no, instead you talk about the Darkmoon Fair and sweet-talk the LFR...<br />
<br />
This would have been so much better, while the foam at the mouth 'WHY U HATE ME BRO' interview that some want isn't a good idea or even a possibility, the above one is. There is a lot of questions from more critical viewpoint that should be asked and answered in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could have asked him why the heroic loot table is incomplete.<br />
<br />
You could have asked him why we get less and less gear with every tier, even though reforging was going to make those non set pieces more desirable to tie you over.<br />
<br />
You could have asked him why they rolled LFR out without a functioning loot system for it, the issues with the current one is well known since LFD launch and additional once was easy to figure out by spending 5-10 minutes thinking about potential issues.<br />
<br />
You could have asked him why they still did nothing about the wasted loot issue in 10man, especially with tier pieces in mind.<br />
<br />
And that's only about Dragon Soul raid and 4.3.</div></div><hr />

If you really wonder why we won't go to a developer and ask him &quot;SO HUH, YEAH, I KNOW YOU HATE ME AND WANT ME TO BE SAD FOR 2 SEASONS, WHY???&quot; I think you might want to try thinking about it again. Blizzard doesn't have a plan to steal your candies and make you sad. Really.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to disagree with you Boub, but people are playing 4.3 now, apparently there is class imbalance now, and not in MoP. I can imagine people being upset about it not being fixed. If it's always going to be fixed in a future patch, it's not getting fixed. If you're going to do a 4.3 interview and not an MoP interview, I'd say Korgoth has a very valid point.<br />
<br />
I honestly didn't find the interview too exciting either. Questions were asked, and the answers given were always confirmed, never questioned.</div></div><hr />

Do you know what kept archaeology alive? It was the useful ilvl 359 weapons for max lvl players, nothing else. Unfortunately those items are crap by now and archaeology died. Adding more low lvl crap doesn't even make much sense because people lvl fast and 3 days later their item becomes useless until they lvl the same class to the same lvl but would they do that.</div></div><hr />

But you wouldn't ask a question as to if they are going to fix whats currently broken or even acknowledge that it is broken. All these Q and As are completely pointless when you just softball in questions with obvious answers. <br />
<br />
The question I want one of you spineless sell outs to ask is why they leave classes like Warrior garbage, while leaving Mages overpowered, why they choose to make one class shit for almost an entire expansion, and the other overpowered? I want you to call them on their bullshit. But yeah I don't expect it.<br />
<br />
&quot;My class is nerfed to the ground and that class is overpowered.&quot;<br />

Dual daggers would have been fine, if enh shams, confused fury warriors, and hunters would be able to use as well as rouges, especialy with the difference in time and dificulty to obtain these daggers to all previous legendaries first forms. in 4.2 you needed 25 embers and a raid fight, in ICC u needed 25 primordial seranite, in ulduar u needed 25 legendary shards, in BC u needed a tiny ass drop chance, in naxx u needed shards to make the staff, a number i do not know of. but this one only requies to pickpocket a boss and do a bunch of solo quests and 24 hrs of wiaitng i guess the 24 hrs is the colletion quest on this legendary.</div></div><hr />

You want to teach us &quot;kids&quot;, as you call those you want to demeen due to not sharing your fanboy view with you, by quoting etiquette, while at the same time your attempt at a conversation starts off by trying to insult me? Well done, big guy, you sure showed me. Perhaps mmochamp will give you a special forum title if you suck enough of their orificies, seeing as how this forums is obviously your alpha and omega of self ego stroking.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you claim these interviews are nothing but promotion - done by a fan site - then I suppose mmochamp got paid for doing this and publishing it? The magazine I work for also has some promotional interviews which are part of this or that marketing campaign, but those aren't done by our journalists, but by their PR people and they pay us to publish them. In turn, by law, we must include a disclaimer with those interviews, saying it's a promotional text - hence, biased.<br />
<br />
Well, I suppose your come back will include more randomized yappering about imaginary friends and knowledge of PR, so I just wasted 2 minutes writing a reply to some social troglodyte. Eh, the joke's on me.<br />

<br />
Class balance questions are pointless because they are rarely objective. Class balance also tends to change from patch to patch so each phase of OPness is of limited duration. Ghostcrawler really can't say anything beyond that any imbalance will be addressed in the coming patch.<br />
<br />
In any case, 4.3 class balance issues would be prostponed until 5.0 anyway.<br />
<br />
And let's be honest here for a second. Overall class balance has been pretty solid in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it seems like someone lost a bit too often there... I don't know in witch time the pvp in wow was balanced as you would consider that all classes have legimate counters and the same value in arena or bgs... I think the answer is never here, the only thing you want is some piece of the op-cake if people cry about imbalance then they want to say &quot;my class sucks because i can't faceroll it, plz give me the fun back which only op-ness can provide&quot;. Try to balance that many speccs and you will find it impossible without making every specc nearly the same or without taking something from one specc which is considered op but without it they might miss a counter against another class which is then op, you see your rage is useless until you provide some magical fun way of making every class playable, not boring, but also balanced...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you nuts? There’s a huge gap between Normal mode clearing guilds and Heroic mode clearing guilds. You can’t lump them in to one difficulty and expect both to be happy. The whole point of LFR is now you can clear a raid with little effort in a PUG without watering down Normals, which should be balanced for the mere mortal raiding guilds. Instead of funnelling them in to the first ⅓ or ½ of Heroics and hitting a brick wall.<br />
<br />

Just because you've gotten used to being treated like crap doesn't make it any more okay. <br />

Class imbalances have like the one between mage/warrior have no real reason to exist. It's just that Blizzard doesn't care enough to fix it. And they hope that the players have gotten so used to it that they won't mind. But it's still not okay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps ask some questions from a critical standpoint without being disrespectful, a simple one would be regarding loot distribution in raids.<br />
<br />
DS are missing heroic cloaks, heroic non spirit caster neck, no way to obtain heroic relics, no heroic non spirit off hand, an ever decreasing amount of off set pieces, off set pieces that where supposed to be more valuable due to reforging.<br />
<br />
LFR loot system was a disaster before it was implemented and anyone that played the game through LFD could point out the flaws of it, yet it was released.<br />
<br />
These issues could have been questioned in a respectful way with ease, even if just to get a general explanation on how they reason on decisions like those, we as customers still pay them over 1 billion dollars a year, I'd say that gives us some right to at least be some what critical when it comes to there design.</div></div><hr />

You can still only receive loot once per character, but what some hardcore guilds are doing, is taking 24 alts and 1 main into LFR, and funneling all that gear into the one toon. So each main raider gets their own personal LFR.</div></div><hr />

Why not ask him about the downsides of the LFR and how it allows almost everyone to &quot;complete&quot; the game within a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Ask him how Blizzard intends to curb the downwards spiral which the game seems to be in at the moment.<br />
<br />
Ask him about his opinion on 15 man raids and if there's any chance we might see them anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Ask him about a 3rd pillar of endgame content that can coexist with Raids and Arena.<br />
<br />
Ask him to reflect on some of the design decisions made in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Ask him to react to some of the criticism directed at WoW.<br />

<br />
But no, instead you talk about the Darkmoon Fair and sweet-talk the LFR...<br />

He's the man though, after years of RTS development, he's given us such winners as Wrath and Cata. His job is to make the game fun for everyone so that they can draw on a huge casual player crowd. After they started making real money with this title the game took a turn and it's not going back. It's all about fun and playing it your way, not the way it was originally designed. Sorry! Move along. I think the BEST part about LFR and it's primary advantage is that they don't need to nerf the regular and heroic content as everyone will see the content as they always wanted. Oh wait, nerfs are coming because people will start demanding HM gear and all this &quot;design of three difficulty levels&quot; goes out the window. It's not about seeing the content, it's about having access to gear. And linking 6/8 Hardmode achievements 5 months after the content gets the whack. Gimme a break.</div></div><hr />

He's a dolt, to put it politely. He couldn't make it in a field that actually required a brain so he decided to make a mockery of video games.<br />

Yeah, fortunately that isn't very widespread. It is hard to discourage, and if they are enjoying it and it doesn't hurt game balance, we are okay with that. What do they mean with that ? You can't get gear from a boss you already downed once, or am i missing something ?<br />

They have enough. Give other classes some weapons out of holidays; weapons are always the most difficult freaking thing to come across - would it really kill then to have some 2H weapons that could be random loot? Or a shield? But no, it's always a 1H Agility weapon.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard and Curse run those guys. Why do you think they're so rampant in this game and not so much in other games? It's how they get 12 mil subs, half are farmers to sell to the other half, you.<br />

Also love the fan arts, as always. Awesome work.</div></div><hr />

Build the Mumble/Vent clients into the game, then have it so that a party leader can select a Mumble/Vent server from the list of public/private servers attached to each player (ie, I'd have my Mumble server set to public, meaning anyone I was in a group with could join and the party leader could make it the default). It could be ten times easier to use than a standalone client, plus it'd be able to include a whole bunch of sweet interface options. I don't know what I'd like more, being able to invite people in without giving them the password or actually being able to see voiceover icons when people say 'over here'.</div></div><hr />

I guess i just expect to have enough content of varying difficulties to keep me interested in the game. I may very well be the only one of the opinion that lfr/normal/heroics are all practicality the same thing and I can feel my interest in these 8 bosses wavering already.</div></div><hr />

There’s a huge gap between Normal mode clearing guilds and Heroic mode clearing guilds. You can’t lump them in to one difficulty and expect both to be happy.<br />
back then we only had 2 difficulties, so your solution would have been to leave normal mode and hard mode to organized guilds and nothing for pugs (or whatever you want to call them) to make everyone happy?</div></div><hr />

Nice find, thanks, just wanted to start looking whether he has a gallery on deviantart, too. I'm especially glad to see he uploaded high resolution versions there, the standard resolution stuff just doesn't do justice...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as PVE is concerned this may be true, however as far as PvP in cataclysm is concerned class balance has been a joke.<br />
<br />
Not That I expect PvP class balance in WoW to stand up to MLg gaming standards but there comes a point when you have to realize that the person handling the balance issues is either letting their personal feelings get in the way or has simply decided to just say f#ck it &amp; given up.<br />
<br />
They really do know what they need to do to balance PvP, hopefully in MOP they either finally do it or find a new way that works because using the excuse that you don't want to confuse &quot;new&quot; (they really mean idiots) people is getting old.</div></div><hr />

No, we want stuff that lasts untill the next patch, but with every new patch since Cata launched, there has been less and less content for raiders that last untill the next patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Formoor</div><div class="date">2011-12-18, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general, how well do you think Patch 4.3 went? We are pretty happy with it, as it was a huge patch for us. Large patches like this always come with a risk that we will screw something up, but it was a pretty smooth launch for as much content as we had in there. Think Blizz lowered its expectation greatly. Last content patch in WoLK = 12 bosses, 4 wings. Each wing opened after a certain amount of time. (2-4 weeks if I remember correctly) Last content patch in Cata = 8 bosses (that's 1/3 less). All bosses opened at the same time = 1 week - Deathwing was dead. The one thing I can say Blizzard can be proud of is the LFR finder, which will help casual players a bit, because it introduces a new difficulty to the game: LFR - easy difficulty Normal raid - normal difficulty Heroic raid - hard difficulty Heroic PVP difficulty is needed: 5 vs 10 for instance :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what i mean, and 3 difficulty levels of the same 8 bosses i don't see myself making it to a full heroic clear due to pure boredom.<br />
<br />
looks like pvp is the only thing that will keep me playing until next patch</div></div><hr />

Wait, so your logic is to play the game now, while your class is broken, and threaten NOT to play it when it gets fixed?<br />
<br />
Try this: Unsubscribe now, and don't come back unless they fix it. That'll teach'em.</div></div><hr />

How about next time you throw him a real question like, &quot;Why are you leaving Resto Druids, Arms Warriors, and Enh Shaman completely gimp in pvp for 2 whole seasons while Mages, Locks and Resto Shamans get to continue on being blatantly overpowered?&quot;or maybe, &quot;Why is C Smash still nerfed on Arms warriors in pvp when the spec is doing horribly, and almost every other class gets 100% armor penetration and are bursting for 30-50k a global?&quot;or my favorite, &quot;How many more subscribers have to quit before your untalented biased ass gets fired?&quot;<br />
<br />
As if the classes u have mentioned are gimped, maybe shaman, but i have seen alot of decent shammies in arena that can compete with a holy pally very well. As for arms warrior, yeah right, honestly give me a break with the amount of cc u guys have and power u'r able 2 throw stop QQ'ing over a class that is so not gimped. U guys can pretty much own everything, maybe the only class u might have trouble with is a mage. As for locks being op just shut up, u honestly dont have a clue what u'r talking about. And lets not even go there with Resto Druids, they are know 2 be OP all along. With cyclone, being a cc that can outright outshine Fear in it's heydays. Mobility when stuff goes wrong, and their awesome heals, they are come out as the best in all healing classes. It's probably just u, u'r not playing the classes right, or u'r going in BG's with no res expecting 2 walk in like God Mode. I know when u'r over 4k res u'r pretty much on equal footing with everyone and it comes down 2 skill 2 try and defeat ur opponent. Even mages cant plow down their enemy with a few lucky shots.</div></div><hr />

That would give an option to people who level just to do these raids for the fun of it. Because at the end of the day the old raids aren't exactly popular. Assuming if they add older raids that any level(+) can join these raids then it will be great. Since most people are just interested in achievements but giving the option for lower level players to take part in the raids(the level they are meant for) a chance to get some fancy loot to level in.</div></div><hr />
