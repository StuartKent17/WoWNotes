Judging by the icons, yes.<br />
<br />
I do wonder about the Darkspear Rebellion achievement... Seeing it's been a FoS before and now again I wonder if it is an event you can only participate in during these few patches and will be removed in the next expansion. I suppose it'd make sense to phase it out somewhat so people aren't too confused, but I am curious as to how it'll work out.</div></div><hr />

They didn't buff Shuriken. The doubled the damage, but doubled the energy cost too...so it'll hit harder, but will be twice as slow.<br />

absolutely baffling (yeah, I see they doubled the energy cost, but I'm not sure how making it less sustainable while making it more bursty addresses anyone's complaints)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Living Bomb change for limitless targets upon explosion will hopefully compel me to drop Nether Tempest unless the mobs die really fast.<br />
They did, but they also increased the energy cost by 20. I don't play a rogue at 90 so I can't tell if the dmg buff far outweights the energy cost.<br />
<br />
Also, I want the Ancient Protector battle pet :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
fewer CP maybe, but since ST activates ranged autoattack, I would imagine the reduction in poison damage is negligible</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure if it is the unannounced feature... seems kind of weak by itself to do so. Maybe they are adding some wowhead or whatever integration to allow direct links from web browser into game, and possibly allowing the compare item in wowhead to currently equipped item feature.<br />
<br />
Also, maybe Hearthstone integration?!?<br />
<br />
Since they have some kind of &quot;clear cookies&quot; feature, it sounds like they are going to allow browsing to external websites.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this will be accessible by addons, as that would:<br />
1. allow for direct uploading of logs, coordinating with open raid and the like, ect...<br />
2. Be a potential security risk of bad addons that secretly log your chat and details while sending it to an external site.</div></div><hr />

Those 4 treants will indeed be pets going from the name of the images (ANCIENTPROTECTORPETFALL2) and the new &quot;Blossoming Ancient&quot; companion pet that is listed.<br />
<br />
Spotted this too - Blossoming Ancient (New) Right Click to summon and dismiss your Blossoming Ancient. This pet changes with the seasons. Battle Pet. Instant.<br />

so it'll just be one pet but it changes as the year progresses.</div></div><hr />

Words cannot encompass how many things are wrong with your understanding of what's written, and by extension, your post. They rearranged where the damage lies on a talent no one used because it was far inferior to it's counterpart(s). A buff would be if it didn't hit like a wet noodle on explosion in addition to this change... As it stands, it's a tweak.</div></div><hr />

and wow, they buffed shuriken toss? wth?<br />
<br />
they buffed its dmg output to compensate for nerfing its ability to stack combo points, rogue were abusing this and destroying primal direhorns that drop 17-21 bones in no time at all due to how fast they could stack combo points with no drawback to use deadly throw for craptons of dmg really quickly and effortlessly</div></div><hr />

<br />
People that complain about class mechanics that they clearly don't understand are just adorable. This will not affect the Mage single target game at all, Nether Tempest will remain superior for that. Nor will it be useful in mass AoE. It may be a slight buff to our 2-4 target game at best, but that could use one, which is obviously the point.</div></div><hr />

must be a fantastic game, since you spend time in a forum talking about WoW. Shouldn't you be playing GW2? people talking about how something is better than their competitors on their site always sound like they have serious inferiority complex cases. If you like GW2, go play and stay there. We don't go to your forum pulling this kind of retarded stunt, it's quite sad.<br />
<br />
and lol at everyone QQing about Living Bomb, anyone even read what the change is about? it's not a buff. geez. <br />

Guild Wars 2.<br />

yeah, I try to explain this all the time. Even if a game is free, it still can not be worth my time to log in if it is that bad. GW2 falls into that category. I would rather pay $15 per month to play WOW, then pay nothing to play GW2, AOC, or SWTOR. Watching paint dry is free also, it doesn´t mean it is a good thing to do with you time.</div></div><hr />

Yeah Guild wars 2.<br />
<br />
I notice he didn't address this point. I actually enjoyed the levelling process in GW2 quite a lot but the game suffers from a complete lack of endgame. With no raids and no gear progression path, you're not really left with much else. Championing &quot;no gear treadmill!&quot; is intriguing, but they sort of replaced it with...nothing. I also find the lack of utility skills a bit frustrating, and the limited CC. It's fun while it lasts though and the jumping puzzles are a highlight, brings me back to wall jumping in vanilla WoW back in the day =P</div></div><hr />
