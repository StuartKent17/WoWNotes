Cataclysm Build 12694 - Reputation Enchantments<br />
The latest beta build added the spells for reputation enchantments, nothing really super-interesting but I figured it would make a couple of theorycrafters happy.<br />

<br />
200% crits<br />
Warlocks and mages get 200% crits.<br />
<br />
We have talents or passives for the hybrid classes because we want the nukers to get the big crits but not the healers. But for mages and warlocks, it seemed silly to have identical passives that say &quot;you get 200% crits&quot; when we don't do that for all the melee classes who get 200% crits.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, hunters also get 200% crits in Cataclysm. They already did for the most part on all of their physical attacks, but unless I'm mistaken, attacks like Arcane Shot could only get a 150% crits. That is fixed for Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435283690/no-ruin-complete-devaluation-of-crit/))<br />
<br />
Raid Buffs in Cataclysm<br />
Nobody has more powerful versions. All raid buffs are identical in power in Cataclysm. Some have different durations or radii or other measurements of convenience. &quot;I won't get brought because his buff is more powerful than mine,&quot; is a pretty reasonable argument. &quot;I won't get brought because his buff is more convenient than mine,&quot; just doesn't carry the same punch.<br />
<br />
Players are going to find themselves in situations all the time where they bring the same buff that someone else brings. Shaman and paladins are probably in the best situation of bring able to bring something no matter what else the group already has. But we still want for groups to be able to bring say two Fire mages, and in that case, their contributions are identical. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435283536/dude-why-my-totem/))<br />
<br />
Failed specs<br />
Yet, even though Enhance's dps was low, there were thousands of dps shaman raiding ICC. By far the majority of raids had at least one. The only specs we really failed on in LK raiding were Frost mage, Subtlety rogue, BM hunter and Arms warrior. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435283536/dude-why-my-totem/))<br />
<br />
Hybrid Builds<br />
We really haven't ever supported the true hybrid builds where someone goes halfway down two trees. It would be one thing if someone really wanted to play say an Affliction warlock who also emphasized demons or the Ret paladin who also wanted to be a better healer. But almost without exception the hybrid builds that have ever existed involved sneaking down into a second tree to get an overpowered talent or two. The developers never really wanted the last talent in a tree to be a decision. They want you to get that talent. When players would make builds that didn't go to the bottom of their tree they would feel like something was wrong with the tree. Nobody wants that 31-point talent to be a hard choice.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, go get that 31-point talent. You'll have some decisions to make on the way down and then you'll have 10 points that can get you 3 or 4 additional talents from a pool of 15 or so that are left over. Not all of those builds will make sense, but many of them will. That feels like plenty of choice to me and both you and we will know that you have the basics that make your spec work.

Subtlety<br />
We're going to make Dirty Tricks baseline.<br />
<br />
We still think the mobility between Subtlety and the other trees is a little far apart. This is something we want to address.<br />
<br />
We also think Subtlety's damage against heavy armored targets is probably a little low and we're looking at that as well.<br />
<br />
However, as we said in the Twitter dev chat, if you had a tree with Assassination's burst or Combat's timers *and* Shadowstep and Prep, why would you play anything else in PvP? In PvE, we want to get all 3 rogue specs to be as close together as possible. But part of that involves Rupture and Honor Among Thieves, which are just more potent in PvE than PvP. In PvP, we think it's fair that Subtlety does less toe-to-toe damage given that the tree has so many advantages when not toe-to-toe.

Sprint cooldown<br />
I will admit that the 3 min cooldown on Sprint feels a bit antiquated. It's something we're discussing but it's too soon to promise anything. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010595/rogues-sub-speccing-sub/))<br />

Totems not as useful as before?<br />
This is a pretty common sentiment among shaman, but it's just not one we agree with. Elemental shaman having to give up their dps totem for a dps buff was a situation we weren't happy with. But Enhance giving up a dps buff for utility totems -- and very powerful utility totems -- isn't the same thing in our minds.<br />
<br />
We don't want to have to balance the game around the assumption that Earthbind or Tremor Totem are up 100% of the time in a raid, which they would be if they also gave you the Strength of Earth buff. (For starters, we'd have to give equivalents to other classes since otherwise having a shaman would be a huge advantage.) Once you remove Tremor and Earthbind, (and disregarding Stoneclaw and Earth Elemental as super situational) then you're left with Strength of Earth vs. Stoneskin, and the powers of those two really aren't comparable. If you have one shaman, drop Strength of Earth. If you have two, or someone else who can bring that buff, then you can add Stoneskin. If you really need Earthbind or Tremor for an encounter, then you can live without Strength of Earth. Most of the time in PvE when you need those other two, it's not for the entirety of the fight anyway. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435283536/dude-why-my-totem/))<br />
<br />
[...] If the model was that shaman were brought for their buffs then that would be a problem. But the model is that shaman are brought because they contribute to the group as a whole, which includes bringing some buffs (and to be fair, more than most classes) but also doing competitive dps. If your dps is too low, then *that* is the problem, not that you don't bring a powerful buff so awesome that you're virtually guaranteed a raid spot even if you go AFK half the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435283536/dude-why-my-totem/))<br />
<br />
[...] And if you have a paladin, you probably have Devotion Aura, so then there is no reason to drop Stoneskin either. And if the group also has a warrior, then that warrior might Battle Shout, rendering Horn of Winter useless. You just aren't going to be guaranteed a raid slot because you bring the only reasonable version of a group buff. The good news is that nobody is.

Rage Normalization - Crits no longer generate extra rage<br />
We actually are concerned that even with normalization that rage scales too well with gear. Currently on beta, rage generation feels about right at level 80, but the income drops down more and more with higher levels. Now we have no doubt once warriors get epic gear with tons of haste and crit that they will have plenty of rage again, but that's the problem that rage normalization was really intended to fix.<br />
<br />
The solution we're looking at, and I predict a lot you aren't going to like it, is not to have crits provide extra rage. That will let us bump rage income across the board without it getting infinite again at the epic level. This actually provides a certain amount of consistency with other classes because then crit would be about bigger numbers and haste would be about being able to do more because you have more resources to work with.<br />
<br />
We think to feel right that warriors (and bears) generally need enough rage income to hit their main rotational buttons, but not Heroic Strike or Cleave. You might occasionally have to wait a second for that Bloodthirst or Mortal Strike, but we don't want that to be a regular occurrence (unless you just squandered your rage by playing badly.) Getting a lot of rage, because say you were stunned or took a lot of damage from something or the shaman popped Bloodlust, then just lets you Heroic Strike or Cleave more, get bigger Executes, save GCDs from going to Bloodrage, etc.<br />
<br />
But also to feel right, this needs to occur in both quest greens and fully-gemmed and enchanted endgame gear. We don't think that is happening enough yet on beta.<br />
<br />
Rest assured, you'll still scale just fine with gear. <br />
<br />
Hit rating and rage generation<br />
We know Cataclysm warriors will value hit pretty highly, and to be honest that's not a bad place to be coming off of LK where warriors viewed hit as junk. Then again, part of that was because of the Heroic Strike bug, so maybe hit would have been more valuable even in LK.<br />
<br />
We're also taking a hard look at combat ratings across the board right now in Cataclysm. We removed so many passive combat ratings from the talent trees (as well as things like Misery and the Draenei racial) that we're concerned that our current ratings are too brutal. If we relax those, then everyone will see their hit go up.<br />
<br />
If after all that dust settles warriors still are penalized too much for a miss then we might consider something to address that, but only if we were confident that warriors would still desire hit on gear more than they did in LK. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262991198/same-rage-gen-problems-in-beta/))<br />
<br />
Rage &quot;nerf&quot;<br />
It's just tricky because we know that warriors used to the Icecrown raiding environment are going to feel rage nerfed almost no matter what. Some of those warriors are going to complain about being rage starved anytime they aren't hitting Heroic Strike on cooldown. We just have to be very cautious when we get feedback. It is 100% supposed to be a nerf, but only to the degree of having to pay attention to that red bar up there under your health. It isn't supposed to be a dps nerf (minus the Heroic Strike bug and Shadowmourne and other things that make Fury dps too high on live). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262991198/same-rage-gen-problems-in-beta/))<br />
<br />
Warrior Scaling<br />
Totally. A little more rage is fine. Cats get more combo points as their geat gets better. Mages get more mana. We're just worried that the Cataclysm numbers currently in beta will make warriors still scale too well with gear, which means the leveling warriors don't have fun or the warriors facing the Bastion of Twilight out-dps the other classes.

<br />
This is exactly a topic when you realise that CURRENT Blizzard devs have lost the basics and the core of an entire game. What is a &quot;hybrid&quot; class in Cata? - oh ... wait .. there IS none. And the reasons acording to Blizzard is &quot;the hybrid builds that have ever existed involved sneaking down into a second tree to get an overpowered talent or two&quot;. Hmm ... really? I have yet to hear of a Holy paladin that speced half way down to Tank tree to get better at healing PVE content...<br />
<br />
Lets talk facts here. Poor DESIGN makes for ppl exploiding game mecanics. And in this case - we are talking BALANCE . And no.. we are NOT talking overall balance... We are talking PVP balance ONLY<br />
Lets look abit deeper into this Blizzard statement. The last point in each tree would be the defining talent of each spec... then that exact talent would be the one that makes an ENTIRE class a PERFECT <br />
1) tank in PVE and PVP (oh... there is no tanking in PVP) <br />
2) Perfect HEALER in both PVP and PVE... hmm) <br />
3) Perfect DPS in both PVP and PVE (actually possible if there was just ONE kind of PVP - Withc is NOT the case since PVP is open world - 2v2 -3v3 -5v5 (rated) and then <br />
battlegrounds).<br />
<br />
Overall - this statement from Blues goes as FAR as possible from a person that actually knows what the term Hybrid means. Hybrids are NOT about balance... they are about Choises ! And that EXACTLY what Blizzard has removed from the game... <br />
<br />
And the sad part... they are not removing it because it improves the game for most players or make it more intresting... No - They are doing it because they are YET again trying to balance two SEPERATE parts of the game. Two parts that are TOTALY irrelevant to the other - if not for the fact of 3 talent trees... <br />
<br />
And btw... since when has BLizzard managed to make ANY Hybrid tree that makes the 31 point talent a &quot;defning&quot; talent for that class - Hmmm... lets start with holy paladin Cata 31 talent that heals players INFRONT of the player while all the other healers can just hit a button and do the exactly same not worrying where they stand as long as they are in range... lol how poor of a group healer must a class be if that is a must compared to the other smartheals ingame? <br />
<br />
oh... and I still wonder if that Holy paladin talent is actually a defing talent for PVP and PVE... ye... right.... 2v2... lets hit that frontal healing saviour !!!<br />
<br />
Cut the crap Blizzard.<br />
<br />
If you want balance then lets see 1 tree for each class in PVP . Defining ablies that make the ENTIRE class and lets build the PVP balance from there. For god sake stop destroying an entire game trying to balance something that is NOT possible. And stop ruining the entire game for BOTH PVP and PVE while at it...<br />
<br />
And back to poor design. When will BLizzard realise that designing a &quot;core&quot; classes for PVP and PVE isn't possible when 1 of those 3 core classes isn't vialbe ? Im OFC talkning PVP and Tanking. So... Design your game properly or just explain the TRUTH instead of bringing out statements like the one above.</div></div><hr />

That said, this raid buff swapping they're doing is just going to make buffs/debuffs arbitrary, and Blizzard will design encounters assuming you have more of them available. <br />

I think its total bullshit that we are losing the hybrid build!!! I love the fact that while farming or leveling my lock can have a fel guard out and still do alot of dmg. forcing me to go all demo just to get the fel guard is bullshit because a full demo build sucks and you cant raid with it and your dmg sucks overall. Guess Ill never play my lock again. Thanks blizzard for screwing something else up.</div></div><hr />

Then play a ret paladin and stop whining. Warriors are balanced around a certain level of rage generation. That's the whole reason they're underpowered in poor gear and overpowered in end-game gear. It's been that way since Vanilla. Finally they're actually going to try and fix it.<br />

We really haven't ever supported the true hybrid builds where someone goes halfway down two trees. It would be one thing if someone really wanted to play say an Affliction warlock who also emphasized demons or the Ret paladin who also wanted to be a better healer. But almost without exception the hybrid builds that have ever existed involved sneaking down into a second tree to get an overpowered talent or two. The developers never really wanted the last talent in a tree to be a decision. They want you to get that talent. When players would make builds that didn't go to the bottom of their tree they would feel like something was wrong with the tree. Nobody wants that 31-point talent to be a hard choice.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, go get that 31-point talent. You'll have some decisions to make on the way down and then you'll have 10 points that can get you 3 or 4 additional talents from a pool of 15 or so that are left over. Not all of those builds will make sense, but many of them will. That feels like plenty of choice to me and both you and we will know that you have the basics that make your spec work. <br />
<br />
This is exactly a topic when you realise that CURRENT Blizzard devs have lost the basics and the core of an entire game. What is a &quot;hybrid&quot; class in Cata? - oh ... wait .. there IS none. And the reasons acording to Blizzard is &quot;the hybrid builds that have ever existed involved sneaking down into a second tree to get an overpowered talent or two&quot;. Hmm ... really? I have yet to hear of a Holy paladin that speced half way down to Tank tree to get better at healing PVE content...<br />
<br />
Lets talk facts here. Poor DESIGN makes for ppl exploiding game mecanics. And in this case - we are talking BALANCE . And no.. we are NOT talking overall balance... We are talking PVP balance ONLY<br />
Lets look abit deeper into this Blizzard statement. The last point in each tree would be the defining talent of each spec... then that exact talent would be the one that makes an ENTIRE class a PERFECT <br />
1) tank in PVE and PVP (oh... there is no tanking in PVP) <br />
2) Perfect HEALER in both PVP and PVE... hmm) <br />
3) Perfect DPS in both PVP and PVE (actually possible if there was just ONE kind of PVP - Withc is NOT the case since PVP is open world - 2v2 -3v3 -5v5 (rated) and then <br />
battlegrounds).<br />
<br />
Overall - this statement from Blues goes as FAR as possible from a person that actually knows what the term Hybrid means. Hybrids are NOT about balance... they are about Choises ! And that EXACTLY what Blizzard has removed from the game... <br />
<br />
And the sad part... they are not removing it because it improves the game for most players or make it more intresting... No - They are doing it because they are YET again trying to balance two SEPERATE parts of the game. Two parts that are TOTALY irrelevant to the other - if not for the fact of 3 talent trees... <br />
<br />
And btw... since when has BLizzard managed to make ANY Hybrid tree that makes the 31 point talent a &quot;defning&quot; talent for that class - Hmmm... lets start with holy paladin Cata 31 talent that heals players INFRONT of the player while all the other healers can just hit a button and do the exactly same not worrying where they stand as long as they are in range... lol how poor of a group healer must a class be if that is a must compared to the other smartheals ingame? <br />
<br />
oh... and I still wonder if that Holy paladin talent is actually a defing talent for PVP and PVE... ye... right.... 2v2... lets hit that frontal healing saviour !!!<br />
<br />
Cut the crap Blizzard.<br />
<br />
If you want balance then lets see 1 tree for each class in PVP . Defining ablies that make the ENTIRE class and lets build the PVP balance from there. For god sake stop destroying an entire game trying to balance something that is NOT possible. And stop ruining the entire game for BOTH PVP and PVE while at it...<br />
<br />
And back to poor design. When will BLizzard realise that designing a &quot;core&quot; classes for PVP and PVE isn't possible when 1 of those 3 core classes isn't vialbe ? Im OFC talkning PVP and Tanking. So... Design your game properly or just explain the TRUTH instead of bringing out statements like the one above.<br />
<br />
A hybrid class is a class that can fulfill more than one role.<br />
<br />
Just because you want it to be something different doesn't mean Blizzard devs are clueless. The only class that has EVER been &quot;hybrid&quot; by your definition is Warlocks in classic with SM/Ruin.<br />

<br />
Yes, but you can only do one job at a time. You can't tank and heal at the same time, in the same way as you can't DPS and heal at the same time. You shouldn't get penalised for being a &quot;hybrid&quot; when there are only 4 pure DPS classes anyway, and 3 of them are ranged. Healers don't get penalised because they have a DPS spec, neither do tanks ... so why the hell should DPS?</div></div><hr />

If by top you mean &quot;barely&quot;, or &quot;I only look at Blood Council fights&quot;, then yes.

<br />
I said &quot;high&quot; DPS, not &quot;highest&quot;. When it comes to BiS gear, end-game content, all the DPS classes and specs should be close. Higher in certain situations, such as when there is a lot of AOE, lower in some, when there is only one target. Sometimes the warrior will be top, sometimes the mage will, sometimes the pally will. None of them should be the top DPS ALL the time. The way Blizz keeps talking about warriors is like somehow they're NOT supposed to be high DPSers, that they're never supposed to top the charts, even when doing what they're best at. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your post is confusing. Barely top of the DPS isn't top of the DPS? <br />
<br />
Fury warriors are only 100 DPS higher than 2nd on the list, that makes them not top of the DPS was the general jist I got from your post<br />
<br />
If you are really going to tell me that when average DPS on those charts is sitting around 15k, that 50-100 dps makes a class so insanely OP that it needs a nerf, then you have failed to understand my point. I'm talking about variances, if the average DPS is 15k, with spike being around 20k and low being around 8, then a Fury Warrior doing 15,155 puts them well within the variance. If warriors were on average doing 2-3k more damage, then yes, they would be massively out of of balance with the rest of the classes.<br />
<br />
Managing Fury rage more means attacking less, attacking less means less DPS. Unless &quot;normalizing&quot; rage generation is so amazingly perfected that a warrior is able to generate enough rage to fight, not quite enough rage to do everything, and more than enough to do nothing, which from all Blizz says, it doesnt, then what the end result will be is that warriors will dps less. And that means nobody will want them around, and people who aren't wanted won't play. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard wanted to fine-tune warriors, then it would be a matter of adjusting the damage that attacks do.

There are 4 fights on which Fury Warriors are top DPS(according to your logs), and on deathwhisper it's obvious because of all the great potentional for AOE cleaves/whirlwinds. The same is true if you tank all 3 BPC bosses near each other, or even just two of them. Outside of that we've got mages for three fights, and one for hunters and one for shammies. Taking the actual numbers into consideration, fury warriors only sit AT BEST 100dps higher than the class right below them, most of the charts indicate that they're within 5-10 dps of the class below them.<br />
<br />
These charts do not indicate that fury warriors are breaking the curve, maybe pushing it a little bit, but certainly not far-and above the BEST dps. The argument that &quot;fury warriors are top DPS and that's bad&quot; is stupid. What part of &quot;fury&quot; and &quot;WARrior&quot; doesn't suggest high DPS?<br />
<br />
Seriously? Look at 25 heroic Icc. Almost every single fight is either all fury warriors or all mages. Look where the dks are? I see more enhance shamans than dks there. Warriors are more than fine.</div></div><hr />

It also helped to be able to break out of vile gas on festergut (or whatever it's called, the stuff that makes you puke) My pet was always doing damage while I moved into position, kiting or being CC'd. Gearing that spec was difficult because I had to try and avoid haste gear and avoid agi in favour or AP or Arm Pen which is hard, but I was pushing over 10k dps back when the ICC buff was only 15% with roughly 5.7k gearscore. Not the bestest ever, but far from fail.<br />
<br />
The majority of players play their spec because it's been mathematically the best, but some of us just play a spec because that's what we enjoy; and provided we're not useless to a raid we're happy enough to lose 1k dps. I consider myself a hardcore player, but I would never have given up my BM spec for anyone. I just love having a huge red t-rex :D<br />

Alright, so you support a mage nerf then too? Deathbringer, PP, BQ and about 50/50 split on LK is all mages. <br />

Unless &quot;normalizing&quot; rage generation is so amazingly perfected that a warrior is able to generate enough rage to fight, not quite enough rage to do everything, and more than enough to do nothing, which from all Blizz says, it doesnt, then what the end result will be is that warriors will dps less. And that means nobody will want them around, and people who aren't wanted won't play. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard wanted to fine-tune warriors, then it would be a matter of adjusting the damage that attacks do. Perhaps even altering the equation to include diminishing returns on how much benefit each special attack you do gets from your attack power. But Blizzard doesn't want to &quot;fine tune&quot; warriors, it wants to smash their faces into the dirt and then spit on them.<br />
<br />
You realize you just pointed out how not having full rage will be solved...<br />
So they normalize rage. Meaning you don't see so much discrepancy between low gear rage gen and high gear rage gen, and generally forcing you to manage rage instead of generally ignoring it.<br />
Your argument is this will result in less attacks, thus less dps.<br />
Yet you just followed up your argument pointing out blizz could change the damage of abilities.<br />
See what you just did there?<br />
Less attacks, ok. How do we solve this insurmountable issue of there being less attacks yet maintaining decent dps? Make the attacks hit harder. Done.<br />
Seriously, if any one dps class is consistently lagging in dps, all they have to do is tweak those specialization bonuses. Remember those, the +8% damage ones you get? Yeah. Your class doing 5% less damage in general than others? All they have to do is bump up that specialization bonus by 5% or so. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it bugs me when people make arguments, and then completely counter their own arguments with another one, all while pretending both are supporting each other.</div></div><hr />

You mean like reducing the bonus enrage gives you and it's duration? You mean like reducing the effect Rampage has on you? You mean like reducing the power of whirlwind in favor of a new single-target attack that is nowhere near as powerful? I've yet to see anything here where Blizz is saying Fury *such-in-such* is doing too little DPS.<br />
<br />
And great! If I gave them an idea that they can workably use to make Fury warriors less furious but still just as viable a DPS role, then that is awesome!</div></div><hr />

Failed specs<br />
Yet, even though Enhance's dps was low, there were thousands of dps shaman raiding ICC. By far the majority of raids had at least one. The only specs we really failed on in LK raiding were Frost mage, Subtlety rogue, BM hunter and Arms warrior. <br />
<br />
I can name maybe three Enhancement shamans in the top raiding guilds on my server (and most of them are alts, or were taken in on alt runs or soaked Enh offspec gear). By far many more were Elemental, and many more than that were Resto. (I mean, hell, I'm the only Enhancement shaman in my guild - two are Resto with Enh offspec for farming/dailies, and another switched to an Arcane Mage because Enhancement became too convoluted.) I am however glad to hear that the raid buff strength will be normalized in Cataclysm, as it levels the playing field a bit, at least for bleeding edge guilds who want the best of the best for progression raids. However, it's a bit doink on Blizzard's part to have Shamans invest 2 points (7 if you're not Enhancement) just to make our buffs the same radius size as buffs that were ... uh ... buffed... to bring their radii to a normalized range.</div></div><hr />

It's not a lot of choice. But I see more choice than on live servers. On live its all cookie cutter or your fail. On beta you get to choose 3 or 4 talents you dont want, sure thats not much but which ones you choose not to take is in fact up to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhaide</div><div class="date">2010-08-09, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hybrid Builds<br />
We really haven't ever supported the true hybrid builds where someone goes halfway down two trees. It would be one thing if someone really wanted to play say an Affliction warlock who also emphasized demons or the Ret paladin who also wanted to be a better healer. But almost without exception the hybrid builds that have ever existed involved sneaking down into a second tree to get an overpowered talent or two. The developers never really wanted the last talent in a tree to be a decision. They want you to get that talent. When players would make builds that didn't go to the bottom of their tree they would feel like something was wrong with the tree. Nobody wants that 31-point talent to be a hard choice.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, go get that 31-point talent. You'll have some decisions to make on the way down and then you'll have 10 points that can get you 3 or 4 additional talents from a pool of 15 or so that are left over. Not all of those builds will make sense, but many of them will. That feels like plenty of choice to me and both you and we will know that you have the basics that make your spec work. <br />
<br />
This is exactly a topic when you realise that CURRENT Blizzard devs have lost the basics and the core of an entire game. What is a &quot;hybrid&quot; class in Cata? - oh ... wait .. there IS none. And the reasons acording to Blizzard is &quot;the hybrid builds that have ever existed involved sneaking down into a second tree to get an overpowered talent or two&quot;. Hmm ... really? I have yet to hear of a Holy paladin that speced half way down to Tank tree to get better at healing PVE content...<br />
<br />
Lets talk facts here. Poor DESIGN makes for ppl exploiding game mecanics. And in this case - we are talking BALANCE . And no.. we are NOT talking overall balance... We are talking PVP balance ONLY<br />
Lets look abit deeper into this Blizzard statement. The last point in each tree would be the defining talent of each spec... then that exact talent would be the one that makes an ENTIRE class a PERFECT <br />
1) tank in PVE and PVP (oh... there is no tanking in PVP) <br />
2) Perfect HEALER in both PVP and PVE... hmm) <br />
3) Perfect DPS in both PVP and PVE (actually possible if there was just ONE kind of PVP - Withc is NOT the case since PVP is open world - 2v2 -3v3 -5v5 (rated) and then <br />
battlegrounds).<br />
<br />
Overall - this statement from Blues goes as FAR as possible from a person that actually knows what the term Hybrid means. Hybrids are NOT about balance... they are about Choises ! And that EXACTLY what Blizzard has removed from the game... <br />
<br />
And the sad part... they are not removing it because it improves the game for most players or make it more intresting... No - They are doing it because they are YET again trying to balance two SEPERATE parts of the game. Two parts that are TOTALY irrelevant to the other - if not for the fact of 3 talent trees... <br />
<br />
And btw... since when has BLizzard managed to make ANY Hybrid tree that makes the 31 point talent a &quot;defning&quot; talent for that class - Hmmm... lets start with holy paladin Cata 31 talent that heals players INFRONT of the player while all the other healers can just hit a button and do the exactly same not worrying where they stand as long as they are in range... lol how poor of a group healer must a class be if that is a must compared to the other smartheals ingame? <br />
<br />
oh... and I still wonder if that Holy paladin talent is actually a defing talent for PVP and PVE... ye... right.... 2v2... lets hit that frontal healing saviour !!!<br />
<br />
Cut the crap Blizzard.<br />
<br />
If you want balance then lets see 1 tree for each class in PVP . Defining ablies that make the ENTIRE class and lets build the PVP balance from there. For god sake stop destroying an entire game trying to balance something that is NOT possible. And stop ruining the entire game for BOTH PVP and PVE while at it...<br />
<br />
And back to poor design. When will BLizzard realise that designing a &quot;core&quot; classes for PVP and PVE isn't possible when 1 of those 3 core classes isn't vialbe ? Im OFC talkning PVP and Tanking. So... Design your game properly or just explain the TRUTH instead of bringing out statements like the one above.<br />
<br />
I think you're reading WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too far into this. He's talking mainly about people neglecting to get that final tier talent point because they can spend that ONE point in the fifth tier from another tree (that they couldn't get without sacrificing that final talent point). An example would be:<br />
<br />
For a very small period of time (until they realized it was happening), some Blood dps specced DKs would forgo Dancing Rune Weapon in favor of Unholy Blight. Because Sudden Doom became a triggered ability rather than a proc that required a GCD, Unholy Blight became more attractive because of the sheer number of extra death coils firing off all the time.<br />
<br />
Bliz doesn't want people skipping over the 'best talent in the tree' (arguably) in favor or something that SHOULDN'T be better even though (because of a mishap) it might be.<br />
<br />
On a final, more personal note, you need to quit complaining. I understand all the issues about balancing for PVP, it can be annoying but don't complain about them taking options away. Think about it, they have 10 classes, each class has at least 3 specs (an argument could be made that druids and DKs have more). That's over 30 options, and a LOT of balancing to do on Bliz's part. If they added more, not only would it be spreading things a bit thin but things would become even more unbalanced which would in turn cause thousands more qq'ers to get on the forums and yell about such and such spec being too OP. 30 options is enough, we really don't need all kinds of spec mixtures making it more complicated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it wasn't until 3.3 that BM was anywhere near the other two specs as far as dps was concerned. It took almost a year for them to make BM even reasonably playable, and even now, its potential is thousands of dps below MM. They failed BM enough that you can't even get a good sampling of what actual (as opposed to theoretical spreadsheet damage) good damage for the spec is. On Wowmeteronline.com, I just became the top BM dps on normal Sindragosa 10...but that's not saying much as there are only eight entries on the list at all. I've been accused of hacking the game because I output halfway decent dps and BM has such a horrible reputation that most people wouldn't dare play it even on the crappy RP server I play on.<br />

<br />
But killing off ALL hybrid builds is a little much. It's the player's choice if they want to skip that bottom talent. Perhaps they really like the way one tree plays, but the bottom talents simply don't appeal to them, so they jump to another tree so they won't be severely nerfed by having unspent talents. <br />
<br />
Having the freedom to choose exactly how far down a tree you would like to go lets players tailor their character into exactly what they want their class to be and do.<br />
<br />
(Personally I'm just pissed that I can't use my holy/prot PvP combo anymore. But the above argument does make sense in my opinion. That's fairly surprising really, since I just pulled that argument out my ass :cool: .)</div></div><hr />

Can spend the 31 points on all the sub stuff, but you still can't go deeper than 10 points into the other trees. :)<br />

We really haven't ever supported the true hybrid builds where someone goes halfway down two trees. It would be one thing if someone really wanted to play say an Affliction warlock who also emphasized demons or the Ret paladin who also wanted to be a better healer. But almost without exception the hybrid builds that have ever existed involved sneaking down into a second tree to get an overpowered talent or two. The developers never really wanted the last talent in a tree to be a decision. They want you to get that talent. When players would make builds that didn't go to the bottom of their tree they would feel like something was wrong with the tree. Nobody wants that 31-point talent to be a hard choice.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, go get that 31-point talent. You'll have some decisions to make on the way down and then you'll have 10 points that can get you 3 or 4 additional talents from a pool of 15 or so that are left over. Not all of those builds will make sense, but many of them will. That feels like plenty of choice to me and both you and we will know that you have the basics that make your spec work. <br />
<br />
I have to oppose this idea. i'm just going to talk about shadow priests since this is my only concern. <br />
<br />
first of all, i generally do pve as shadow and pvp as disc. so i'm a bit worried about shadow pve build when devs say that you can't spend talents in other trees unless you get your 31 point talent. that really is a bad idea for shadow priests who play pve. here's why:<br />
<br />
the talent Phantasm is actually a fail talent for pve. at least for me, since i don't know what will boss encounters be like. i'll just assume it's a fail and go on from there. i can't move down to tier 5 unless i spend a talent on phantasm or imp. psychic scream. those pure pvp talents are totally useless in pve in the gamestyle we're all used to. say that i spend that 1 point talent on one of them... <br />
<br />
3/3 Darkness<br />
2/2 Imp. SW: P<br />
2/2 Veiled Shadows<br />
3/3 Imp. MB<br />
3/3 Imp. DP<br />
1/1 Form<br />
2/2 Orbs<br />
1/1 VE<br />
2/2 Mind Melt<br />
1/2 Phantasm (silly to get this just to move to tier 5)<br />
2/2 Pain &amp; Suffering<br />
1/1 VT<br />
3/3 Twisted Faith<br />
and finally <br />
3/3 Shadowy Appariton<br />
<br />
those are the only talents i am willing to get for shadow pve. just accept it. if you have a shadowfiend with a 3 min cd, you won't be using dispersion unless you generate 23543843213435tps and need to mitigate some nasty boss damage. <br />
<br />
and if the anti-hybrid devs just let me use my last 12 points on disc tree without spending one more point to be able to get dispersion and one more to get it, i'll just spend my points in disc tree, on 3/3 twin disciplines, 2/3 meditation, 2/2 evangelism, archangel, 3/3 imp. inner fire, and finally, POWER INFUSION!<br />
<br />
it's the thing that shadow priests need. every single dps class or build have one cd to activate (free trinket). just 15% damage buff from archangel with 5 stacks of evangelism won't give us the proper burst we will be needing to burn adds, or at least nuke something. 5 stacks of evangelism already gives us 10% so 5% additional damage is nothing compared to a burst. <br />
<br />
i don't want to have dispersion, i already have tons of spells to cast to maintain my dps. and i can't spend 6 secs to get 36% mana. it's really, REALLY a fail ability for me. and i don't want my fade to remove movement impairing effects, because i don't need it to. <br />
<br />
you say you want us to get utility talents instead of passive +damage ones, but you've just put a nice utility talent (a nice burst cd) right out of our reach and tell us that we can't get it just because you don't want us to. <br />
<br />
that's kinda lame imo. people should be able to play as they want to, you say this. but you don't let people to play as they wish because you don't want them to. if somebody wants to use a hybrid spec, just let them. it might give you an idea to change talent trees depending on the builds people use, even if they're hybrids. <br />
<br />
TLDR: dispersion and phantasm fails for pve, power infusion doesn't. just let us get that instead of the stupid shadow talents. tyvm.</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding me? The most op class on live, and according to many the most op on beta is arguing they aren't more op. This has got to be sarcasm. You have a spell that for 6 seconds gives you 36% of your mana, grants you a bunch of immunities, removes silence/stun/etc, and you are complaining? How the $%^&amp; does that work? You are playing a class/tree that has received one big bj from blizz. A good example: try going to any starting area and check out how many priest you see. On bloodhoof the other day it was a mass of priests. In wsg on horde we faced another team with EIGHT spriest over and over. The changes they are planning for this one class are crazy powerful, and you want MORE? Would you be happy if they finally added a spell called<br />
<br />
WTFPWNED instant cast 0 mana you wtfbbqsaucepwn the target inflicting 23094702394 shadow damage and healing you for 99.99999% of the damage inflicted, this spell also creates a bubble around the oppriest preventing all damage for 50 seconds.<br />
<br />
I have two mains, 1 a paladin, 2 a priest. I love my priest, the changes are awesome. We get a great new spell that stacks with itself. We have a burst button already that gives us a boost in damage right when we need it. I have been watching and reading the priest info for awhile, and every time I think &quot;we are so op, we are going to get nerfed to the fing ground just like paladins did&quot;. You watch, you can't make a class this op then them not get nerfed.<br />
<br />
If this seems like a rant, it kind of is. I am tired of bad priest qqing to get MORE from a class that already has so much going for it. If they keep adding to the class they WILL have to take away at some point. It's better to be happy with what they have given the class, which is lots, and then hope when they finally do nerf us it isn't the total beat down they gave paladins/dks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dude. just read what i said again. i'm focusing on pve here. player versus environment. raiding. dpsing. <br />
<br />
i didn't say the changes are bad or must be nerfed or totally useless. and also i didn't qq for anything tbh. i just stated my thoughts on how the 31 point talent is useless in raids. do you really choose dispersion when you have a shadowfiend with 3min cd over 20%cast speed increase and mana cost reduction? phantasm is also useless for pve. again &quot;PVE&quot;. when your job is to deal damage, who needs you to dispel the roots holding your feet? <br />
<br />
i've been playing priest for 5 years now, so i don't think i can be called a &quot;bad priest&quot;. i did my facemelting in vanilla, mana battery job in TBC, and dpsed through WotLK. i know the class from all aspects. just consider who you might be talking to when you just run into the middle to talk trash. <br />
<br />
if these didn't lighten you up a bit, i'll say it again. <br />
<br />
Dispersion is useless for PvE.<br />
Phantasm/Imp. Psychic Scream are useless in PvE<br />
Sin and Punishment is useless in PvE<br />
(doesn't mean they're useless in all aspects)<br />
<br />
Imp. Inner Fire/Archangel/Evangelism AND Power Infusion are win for PvE<br />
<br />
Oh please, please oppose again. Just say that you don't need anymore qq without reading anything. <br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I could post on the normal forums I'd give them a tip and that would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have the rage invisibly increase similar to the way Rogues energy does, when you hit you gain what has been invisibly ticking in, and it's only increasing while you're in combat&quot;.<br />
<br />
That would solve all issues, things that increase Rage gain such as Haste, 25% more rage talent, Arms Passives and such, these would just work similar to how they does now, either give you rage or increase whats invisibly ticking in.<br />
<br />
There you have it, salvation to everything.<br />
<br />
Hit would be as valuable to warriors as it is to Rogues or all other classes, missing one wouldn't hurt you as much just lower your damage done, and being crowd controlled to prevent you from attacking wouldn't hurt your rage gain as much since once you got to attack you would gain all that invisibly gained rage.<br />
And no, it would not make warriors able to stay in combat against mages and just press spellreflect because they would have to hit their enemy to gain that rage which has been invisibly gained.<br />
It would neither make warriors exactly like rogues because of the same thing, the warrior would have to hit their target, also the Rage would only be gained while in combat, combat which you enter by charging or being tapped into.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, and because maybe 10,000 have it, they will punish a million warriors - WoW is going to lose a lot of its luster in Cataclysm and TOR is going to shock people when it hits 3-4 million subs at WoW's expense.</div></div><hr />

Yes...blizard hates warriors...I mean its not like warriors have gotten a legendary in the last 2 expansions...oh wait, they have.<br />
Then you complain about possible changes making you rage starved, well im sorry, every other class already has some mechanick that is comperable, all casters run out of mana, same with healers, rogues and feral druids NEVER have energy, tanks are generally ok because they get hit really hard, but then again no one cares about tanks dps.<br />
<br />
The fact is you guys are complaining about something that isnt even out yet and you have no clue what the numbers are actually going to be.</div></div><hr />
