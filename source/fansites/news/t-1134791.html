BattleTag™ Free Name Change Update<br />
During the Diablo III Open Beta Weekend in April, a number of players opted to use their one free BattleTag nickname change in order to try to participate in the beta test. We recognize that in their excitement to try to get into the game, some players did not fully realize how BattleTags would integrate with Diablo III or that the number of free changes was limited, and they ended up choosing nicknames that they weren't happy with.<br />
<br />
To help address these concerns, we've done a one-time refresh of the free BattleTag name change feature on all Battle.net accounts, so that everyone once again has one free BattleTag name change to use at their discretion.<br />
<br />
This means that if you already used your original free change, you will now have another opportunity to change your BattleTag nickname. If you did not use your free BattleTag name change or have not yet created a BattleTag, you will still only be able to change your BattleTag once for free.<br />
<br />
To set or change your BattleTag nickname, log in to Battle.net Account Management (http://us.battle.net/account/management/), head to the Account &gt; Summary page, and look for the Create or Change option under Account Details. As a reminder, BattleTags aren't unique, so you can pick any name you like as long as it adheres to the BattleTag Naming Policy (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battletag-naming-policy). For more information, see the BattleTag FAQ (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battletagfaq) and Battle.net website page (http://us.battle.net/en/battletag/).<br />
<br />
Remember, your BattleTag serves as your public identity when playing Diablo III, meaning you'll be identified in groups and in chat by your BattleTag -- choose your BattleTag wisely!

Nope, this patch added support for them in the UI, but you can supposedly use them on live as well, as long as you add the friend through D3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also at the very beginning of the fight (stopped video to reply) the mage has an action bar with 1 ability on it, then it switches to a bar with all 4... is this something I don't know about in game or some other program?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's Archon form, it gives you a separate action bar when you use it. <br />
<br />
As far as an auto-clicker program, it doesn't look like it. He's just giving his shift key a workout.</div></div><hr />

Am I mistaken, or that male voice resembles Boubouille at one point? <br />
Like saying: “I could agree with you, but then we both be wrong!” <br />
You know, where he says pandas own, and someone replies with: “Pandas sucks!” or something in that line. Then he replies: “I could agree with you, but then we both be wrong.” <br />
Or is that a common used phrase and I’ve just never heard it before :P?</div></div><hr />

That, and they're designed to not need tanks and healers--so queue times should be shorter.</div></div><hr />

They corpse chain their way to bosses and have other people farm the gear for them. It's not &quot;elite gaming&quot; its cheesing a game thats supposed to be hard, and dont even get me started on how they exploit the res system to be able to beat the bosses. I find it deplorable that their videos are even posted on here with the way they are getting these &quot;world firsts&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance really does not need to be made into the eternal victim by having yet another iconic settlement destroyed. Surely we already have enough reason to go all out on the Horde? Or are the developers overlooking the full extent and implications of the siege of Gilneas - a kingdom that was neutral at the time it was assaulted? I feel as if the storyline between the Horde and Alliance is becoming increasingly contrived and past lore is having little to no acknowledgement. A real shame and disappointment.</div></div><hr />

Clean your ears if you think that sounds like Metzen.<br />
<br />
However, why does the voice sound so familiar....?<br />

Pandaren males sound like they were once adventurers, but took an arrow to the knee...<br />

Ahhhh yeah you are right, I'm certain I've heard the voice in Skyrim... Could very well be the male guard voice.</div></div><hr />

It's an instanced group quest which you can do with 2 or 3 people. No need for tanks or healers and as far as I know (not sure if this is still the case) you can do them as many times as you'd like. Very much like how you could do quests with other people in LotrO. It's a great way to promote the story and lore. This isn't new info though, we've known since Blizzcon '11.</div></div><hr />

Guess so... Hopefully the other races will get a much shorter version. I mean, the pandaren one takes ages and is very annoying.</div></div><hr />

it sounds like the same voice actor as ji firepaw. and some of ji's mannerisms are in the lines, which makes sense, since that's probably the way pandaren talk.</div></div><hr />
