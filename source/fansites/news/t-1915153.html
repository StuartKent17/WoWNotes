Legion - Treasure Demons<br />
Several players in the Alpha have reported seeing the Treasure Demon (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/89407-treasure-demon) appear and start casting an Escape Portal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/178997-escape-portal). It appears to activate a counter that counts down as it escapes, possibly giving you more loot if you kill it faster. It drops gold and Sanctuary Coins (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/122291-sanctuary-coins).<br />

Legion - Unholy Death Knight Artifact Intro <br />
Another Artifact intro today. This one actually has some working voice overs starting at 15:10 (https://youtu.be/6E-Ixfr2uCM?t=910). <br />

Rune of Power changes are not complete yet. It should have 2 charges, 45sec recharge, and drop at your feet. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672885494422769664))<br />

Hail May Male Nelf get more druidic long beards in the future? I'd love my DH to look like this https://t.co/jZujGJEQ26<br />
we're keeping track of these desires, no guarantees but they aren't falling on deaf ears (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672643545048596480))<br />
<br />
https://t.co/JXydljarAI I wouldn't even entertain this. Since WC3, Orcs have hunched. Don't cave, Chris.<br />
.what if it was an option and not a requirement/forced change? I get the argument, hero orcs aren't hunched, cont. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672645615352852480))<br />
.if we did this IMO we would need to give U the choice of which posture you feel most reps your character (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672646306280570880))<br />
That's, like, the perfect solution. Could the Forsaken get the same treatment?<br />
I fundamentally feel like forsaken posture is appropriate for the character, orcs are different (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672653178911875072))<br />
<br />
I know the plan is to match visual color to weapon but pls consider leaving red flame on blue sword https://t.co/H9nt0Tf8o9<br />
that does look cool, will consider (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672649445679349760))<br />
<br />
Hey man, I love plate armor sets, was wondering if y'all could maybe use this model (http://www.wowdb.com/items/9287-field-plate-gauntlets#model-viewer) on newer sets <br />
I'm pretty sure we are, those are used primarily for leather/cloth but we occasionally find a way to sneak them into plate (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672651094456057856))<br />
<br />
Why are Mr. Didier's quotes all through the Art of World of Warcraft book?!<br />
Samwise started all of this with original Warcraft games, any WoW art book would be incomplete without his words (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672641609343721472))<br />
he also continues to contribute to WoW whenever he can - he painted the goblin and worgen crests for instance (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/672642028543414272))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Is there any way we could get a &quot;Target only players&quot; checkbox in controls tab for legion? (same as /targetenemyplayer macro)<br />
Target Next Enemy Player exists in the keybinds (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/672576976314437632))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
what is your view of the ability pruning going on in WoW? Are they going overboard or is it warranted to the extent used?<br />
I'm not familiar enough to have an informed opinion. It is hard to add new abilities when bars are full. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672429104990257153))<br />
<br />
Did u get legion alpha? I'm currently a happy(not) member of No-access club<br />
I did not. I know people, but since I'm not actively playing, it seems mean to deny someone who might appreciate it more. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672500944311988224))<br />
<br />
do you get alpha/beta access on the FF list since your a former dev? always wondered about that.<br />
I rarely ever get early access as a courtesy. Often other devs are the last people you want seeing your unfinished game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671854263551725568))<br />
Ah that's an interesting thought thinking about it, did you go to blizzcon this year btw? If not, do you plan on going again?<br />
I didn't go this year. I had hoped to but it didn't feel right. Maybe next year. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671863586264760322))<br />
It's for Blizzard, not me, and I worry about the way it would come across, like who does he think he is? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671863707790536704))<br />
<br />
Do you ever think that the events of Wrath were a bit too soon? I, personally, feel like that was the big finish.<br />
It was interesting how many players considered that the end of the story. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671853837548843008))<br />
I always considered the story to be orcs vs humans, since those were the original two RTS games. Shrug. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671854045745709056))<br />
It probs comes from the majority of players being active from WC3 to Wrath but I feel the corrupted hero story resounds more<br />
Even before I was at Blizzard, I always said: if in doubt, make the hero become corrupted (Arthas, Kerrigan, Diablo...) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671864057939427328))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. No new hardware that is worth waiting for is expected anytime soon. <br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date. Don't forget to visit the Computer Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer) for any extra questions!<br />

It seems they are preparing to settle down and reduce the content that they produce. I can the following happen within the next few years:<br />
<br />
1) More auto generated content<br />
2) Auto rehashing/scaling of ALL older raids, gear, dungeons and quests.<br />
3) Scaling of gear, damage by level and % (this has been in the game since pre WotLK) to keep content relevant<br />
4) Mini games such as the Treasure Goblin to keep people engaged even when no new raid tiers are out.<br />
5) One / Two Raid tiers per expansion (but probably at a larger scale?).</div></div><hr />

As others have said, and I agree, Diablo III designs are welcome to WoW but only if they fit our system and as much as I enjoy Treasure Goblins in RoS I'm a little nervous (for Blizz) that this is a bit of a push for WoW... but I'm sure they will become a positive feature. And who knows, timed kills may become a grander design in WoW?</div></div><hr />

blizzard is clearly much more happy with diablo model then with wows - its most probably changing in the direction of launch every 2 years with loads of content then year later extra raid tier and nothing else - cheap succesfull addictis will buy anyway so lets milk this cashcow</div></div><hr />

Beyond reliability and sensor accuracy that is all pretty subjective. I don't like the Rival grip as much, but there are 10+ decent mice that could go there. I just picked one.</div></div><hr />

As it stands this every increasing RNG-based loot made me lose doing any kind of content outside of seeing the story and addition of this &quot;Treasure Demon&quot; gives off the vibe that Blizzard is trying to add everything in Diablo 3 that is supposed stay in there, into WoW. Mixing up the essential characteristics of two different genres is a risky business.</div></div><hr />

This is pure BS since there is pruning from talent and spell BUT new passive/spell from talents and artifact and we YET dont have simcraft to write down a rotation.<br />

<br />
Also if adding stuff to the game is going to tip you over the edge to quit, you probably need to reevaluate why you're even playing in the first place. Is it getting a bit silly? Yes, but these are also the kind of systems that's filling huge gaps in WoW's existing content. There's a reason things like Rifts (from, well, Rift) were popular despite the base game not being very impressive. There's a lot of staying power in being able to do something that's procedurally or randomly generated. Just look at the indie gaming scene right now where roguelikes dominate for their replayability.</div></div><hr />

Heck stuff like that has been happening for years in WoW and well Blizz do own all of the IP's involved so they can do pretty much what they like.. And if it works all the better for us the player, but as the Nahela above me said &quot;if adding stuff to the game is going to send people over the edge and quit&quot; then yes they really do need to reevaluate why they play the game.. <br />
<br />
Because if adding in features into the game no matter where they came from makes people aggro then they really do need to take a long hard look at themselves and not the game, because as has been said many times before it is only a game where you are meant to enjoy yourself and have fun and if you can't do that then you should look at doing other things and stop playing games..</div></div><hr />

Can you upload your paper where you have count all the spell for any spec and its relative to Legion?<br />

No joke, take all the spell with CD (even from talent) from WOD and compare to the ones from LEGION (talent and artifact) so we can actually see if we got more o less spells.</div></div><hr />

Well interestingly enough other games like Wildstar / GW2 / ESO and others have minimalist UI's with at most 8 spell buttons, with GW2 having 5 most used spell buttons and as far as I know people have not been complaining about how many spell buttons they have available..</div></div><hr />

I'm not particularly against these changes, as I was one of the few who didn't outright hate Diablo 3 when it came out (gasp!),<br />

I loved D1 and D2, but after some days in D3, I just lost any motivation to log into this game again. I have learned to hate slot machines, and I loved the predictability of WoW in terms of loot, even if it was not dropping every time. <br />
<br />
But I am playing WoW and I don't want this game to become like Diablo. I hate random loot with random stats with random upgrades. This is a crappy design. I also don't need a randomised world or randomised dungeons or randomised mob names. There is a special reason why NPCs and mobs in WoW are in a special place. I like to know where I can find a special rare, and not have to run around endlessly hoping that I will get lucky and this thing spawns right before me.<br />
<br />
In case of dungeon bosses and their loot, the reasons could be even more severe and constraining. I like to know which dungeon I have to go to get a special item, and which boss to kill for that. And I like to know the stats of this item before I get it - whether from a database or because I have seen this item in the equipment of another player. And if I win a roll against the system (=PL) or another player, then I want to get exactly the version of the item I came there to, and not be disappointed because it did not proc an upgrade. I also don't want to waste my time farming for an upgraded version of this item.<br />
<br />
Diablo is hack &amp; slay with an excuse of a story. Randomness fits this slot machine type of game. But an RPG is about story, and random things don't fit into a story concept after they exceed a reasonable degree.<br />
<br />
Also, from a psychologial viewpoint, the &quot;classic&quot; loot system in WoW (with predictable loot, before random upgrades were introduced) is more than enough to hold up replayability of an instance/raid. As long as an item does not drop every time, but has a reasonable chance to drop, you are in a perfect spot in conditioning the players. You can keep the interest in an instance as long as the failure streak is not too long. But if you put too much RNG into this model, you create reactance in a part of the player base - like I have reacted. I know that random upgrades are possibly - but the probability to get this is not worth the extra time investment for me. Therefore, I quit going into the instance.<br />
<br />
Additional value of dungeons is not made with random upgrades, but with additional, continuous bonus from running the instance. It can be reputation, Valor, extra cash/special currency, vanity items etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Same here. Why should Blizz not use a mechanic that was incredibly fun in an other game and introduce it to WoW?<br />
<br />
And for those that feel it is too much Diablo: Open your eyes. The core in both games is anyway the same...repeat the same few tasks(usually killing monsters or searching something) over and over again to get better loot and increase your power...so you can repeat the basicly same quest on a higher level and kill some boss at the end. Diablo is more action, the repeating part is more obvious and it got a different viewing angle and smaller parties...but that's about it.<br />
Relax.</div></div><hr />

What the hell is the matter? I mean, so since the idea was used in Diablo, we can't try it in WoW because it's mixing ideas? Well, we better scrap WoW entirely then because it's an MMORPG, and Ultima Online and Everquest were around first. WoW uses the holy trinity (tank/healer/DPS) man... that's SOOOOOOOO Everquest! I quit!<br />
<br />
Do you guys hear yourselves? They are actively adding content to the game to give you something to do... you know, what you haven't been able to do in WoD, and what happens? A huge whinefest of epic proportions. There's no winning here; they don't add something and they aren't listening to us or aren't giving us anything to do. They add something that is in another game and OH MY LORD, they're Diablofying WoW!!! KEEP DIABLO OUT OF WoW!!!<br />
<br />
I literally do not get it. It's not like these ideas haven't been used elsewhere in other games in some form guys. NOTHING is new in game design. It's using tips and tricks that have been used before with a different twist on them to make them your own. They're using some ideas they used in Diablo to try and see if it'll stick in WoW... and that's a bad idea how, exactly? Do you honestly think time trials, keystones, and special mob types are all things that are exclusive to Diablo and are &quot;Diablofying&quot; WoW? These are ideas that go back to the beginnings of gaming in general; stop being so melodramatic! These aren't ideas culled from one game and thrown into WoW. They're ideas culled from gaming at large and being tried in a different setting... you know... game design! Better keep raids and dungeons out of WoW too. They were done first in Ultima and Everquest. STOP EVERQUESTING AND ULTIMAFYING MY WoW!!!!<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing I've seen that I don't want is the random dropping of legendary items. That, I agree, isn't a well thought out idea and needs to be scrapped or at the very least rethought. There's a difference in an MMORPG and an ActionRPG and having very powerful items drop in the world works in one, but not the other. With that said, everything else has a place and does absolutely nothing but add value and get you out in the world doing things. It makes no sense to whine about an idea and where it comes from. How about try it out and see how it works out before you demonize something and call it &quot;the end of WoW&quot;. It's not that hard and a lot of the ideas look pretty compelling in WoW and could work out well. Nothing should be &quot;taboo&quot; because it worked in a different setting well and is now a known feature of that game.</div></div><hr />

This is one of many.<br />
-Talents ripped straight from Diablo, <br />
-rotations containing as many (or less) buttons as Diablo, <br />
-the NPC chatboxes that pop up in the Legion quests, <br />
-Loot RNG tertieries, Warforged <br />
-Challenge Modes getting turned from a normallized time-trial to Greater Rifts.<br />
<br />
There's a weird amount of stuff from Diablo being added to WoW. I don't like it. WoW is WoW, Diablo is Diablo. Don't have to mix the two. There's just no reason for it.<br />
<br />
It is almost like this game company that owns many franchises in rather similar games that all have seemed to interconnect in some fashion might use things from one franchise in another. I know it seems inconceivable, but its happening. I know its madness. Mages, Warriors, paladins, monks and such all having similar spells across games that use the same classes. If we really want to be serious how much of this stuff was stolen from Dungeons and Dragons especially those talents and abilities. It is almost like you take design ideas that work and implement them in areas where there is needed improvement in another game.</div></div><hr />

It's one thing to have small references to your other games across the board. It's a total different thing if you have 2 distinct brands and you water down one with aspects of the other. That's not a good strategy.</div></div><hr />

The nail in the coffin is a mob being added? Well good riddance then, you surely wouldn't like the other hundred or so being added in Legion too<br />
<br />

<br />
Yep. They're adding as much from Diablo to WoW as possible and hoping it sticks.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is one of many.<br />
-Talents ripped straight from Diablo, <br />
-rotations containing as many (or less) buttons as Diablo, <br />
-the NPC chatboxes that pop up in the Legion quests, <br />
-Loot RNG tertieries, Warforged <br />
-Challenge Modes getting turned from a normallized time-trial to Greater Rifts.<br />
<br />
There's a weird amount of stuff from Diablo being added to WoW. I don't like it. WoW is WoW, Diablo is Diablo. Don't have to mix the two. There's just no reason for it.<br />
<br />
The NPC chatboxes were from Warcraft...<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
That's such a strawman - We aren't complaining about something like - &quot;hey this new car has 4 wheels, that's totally copying from the car with 4 wheels they released last year!&quot; Blizzard can make a &quot;new car&quot; without being an exact rip off of the features amd design they sold you previously.<br />
<br />
This is such a blatant copy and paste, with little to no thought or revision put into it. At this rate the next legion &quot;feature&quot; will be click to move...<br />
<br />
Click to move has been in the game since launch as far as i'm aware so quit your whining and enjoy the fun xpac that Legion will be, or stop playing and do us all a favour<br />

World of Diablo alright. I doubt these Treasure Goblins are going to be fun unless they're a personal mob only. If there's one thing I hate about WoW it's having to tag mobs, or not be able to even see the mob because when it's up, it gets killed within 10 seconds.<br />

<br />
I am afraid that World of Warcraft might transform into pure-rng being, just like Diablo is now. However some of these features might be good.<br />
<br />
Still better than whatever the fuck WoD was. I don't get why people are upset about things that are new to WoW. Sure they aren't NEW, but they proved very successful in D3 and adapting them to an MMO format could present the players with more than &quot;afk in garrison, queue from menu&quot;.<br />
<br />
RNG is a bit of a worry, but that is a separate issue.</div></div><hr />

IIRC, you could also kill monsters and get loot. there were things like grouping and questing as well.<br />
<br />
at some point the stealing has to end. Blizzard needs to add nothing but new stuff to a game. that is, whatever is added to WoW needs to be 100% unlike anything in any other game. they'll have to create new words to describe what they are, because at first glance all we'll be able to do is say &quot;blurhegghh&quot; since we lack the proper vocabulary.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of the treasure demon, if you don't just ignore it when it spawns.<br />

Yeah tell me about it I find it rather sad that people complain about features that comes from another of Blizzes IP's being put into WoW and yet all these years Blizz have been borrowing ideas and features from other games and pop culture and adding them into WoW.<br />

Yeah it is getting so bad that it is getting ridiculous, but unfortunately that will not happen there are too many 2 year olds in these and other forums who want to whine just for the sake of it.<br />

Heaven forbid that Blizz try to make the game more fun for people by adding something new even if they came from Blizzes own IP's.</div></div><hr />

You're ignorant. People aren't complaining about one rare mob. This isn't one diablo thing they're ripping off and forcing into WoW. You all realize that right?

Diablo is Hack&amp;Slay with a slot machine loot concept and too much randomisation in mobs and areas to support a real story. Quests there are shallow and the story is an excuse to kill monsters. It's more than OK for the genre, I have seen less fluff in such games, but it's not the depth which is expected in an RPG.<br />
<br />
WoW gets less and less active skills, RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG in loot (RNG in drops, RGN in 2 different kinds of upgrades), and classes get watered down in their functionality as well - like, warriors can only taunt if they are in their tank spec. Normal rezzes will only be availalable for healers - as if they have forgotten how shitty life was for druids before they have got their normal rez. Every class can use only some of their available abilities not because of talents, but because they are locked to a spec. Yes, Cone of Cold and Dragon's Breath for mages did mostly the same - damaging mobs in a cone - but you could choose a stun or a slow depending on the situation (like, stun for ranged attackers, and slow for melees who can be kited). Now, it either the one or the other because you just cannot have both spells as a mage. We lose utility tools left and right and it's okay? It's not! They already have taken ability pruning too far for my taste, and now there will be even more of this. Will we end up with D3 style of fight, one attack per mouse button? <br />
<br />
Why do they change WoW, when they already have a hack &amp; slay game in their portfolio? That's stupid beyond belief from a marketing point of view. Two distinct brands can attract more customers overall.</div></div><hr />

This is my main worry in regard to this thing. I usually quest on my tank characters in tank spec, and there were hints that healers should also be able to quest / level in heal spec. I don't see how they want to balance this. Will I need a group for that?</div></div><hr />

And posts like yours is why WoW is dwindling. You are aware everyone subsidizes the content, right? Posts like yours make it worse for everyone.<br />
<br />
People have enumerated their concerns and you're still stuck on the treasure goblin. If, by some chance, you still think it's &quot;just&quot; one thing then I'd like to suggest reading this comment thread. It'll inform you of what you're ignorant of.<br />
<br />
And, to add, just because it's a ripoff doesn't mean it fits into WoW well.<br />
<br />
My first experience with the &quot;if you don't like it, then leave&quot; was with the Cata crowd. Guess what happened? People left, worlds grew empty, etc. They made the game easier and put in a catchup mechanic and people came back.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I left because of flying and other issues. I know I'm not alone and I know I'm not part of a trivial minority, as I need look no further than the first flying thread for WoD and the current one for Legion.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you enjoy a solo-mmo because it'd be awfully naive of you to think your guild will survive people &quot;just leaving&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I would probably rather choose AMD R9 380 GPU instead of GTX 960 because it seems to be a little bit more powerful and I beleive it is more future-proof than 960 (as far future-proofed as middle-end budget cards can be anyway :) ). Also I believe that I3 6100 should easily beat AMD 8300/8320 in games due to very limited multi-thread potencial of current games (and most likely future ones too)</div></div><hr />
