Class Balance &amp; Hotfixes - 10/19<br />
We have pushed a hotfix to improve hunter damage.<br />
<br />
Specifically, we increased the damage of the signature abilities (Chimera Shot, Explosive Shot and Kill Command) by 15-25%. This will both improve overall damage-dealing and make sure that these abilities are prioritized higher than other shots. We think this will bring hunters to a good enough state until they hit 85. Aspect of the Fox and Cobra Shot solve some specific issues at higher levels. Marksman hunters may still trump Survival and Beastmaster hunters until they’re 85, since their rotations rely a little on Cobra Shot. <br />
<br />
<br />
EU Raid Testing on Beta<br />
Don't worry, EU can test these bosses tomorrow! I'm not going to turn them off right at 10am our time, I'll keep them up through most all of the day tomorrow.<br />
<br />
On a seperate note, 25 player Maloriak currently has a significant bug in place. We're working on a hotfix, but until that goes live it's not functioning properly. 10 player seems to be much better behaved, but we're looking at a despawn issue with it.<br />
<br />
Atramedes is testable. <br />

Blue Posts<br />
Armor changes in 4.0.1<br />
We looked into your findings, and the armor numbers reflect an intentional change meant to cover the armor increases players would get between levels 81 and 85. We should have been more explicit with the rest of the announced Cataclysm changes that physical damage would go up. (It only affects creatures higher than level 80 -- bosses in this case -- so this change has no current PvP ramifications.)<br />
<br />
Now that our live class balance changes are slowing down* and players are starting to learn their class changes, we can get a better idea of whether players are struggling more on content that they used to be able to clear. We've made some Icecrown and Halion changes already and we may need to make more.<br />
<br />
Nice job on the analysis.<br />
<br />
* -- We are continuing to make Cataclysm changes for classes. We will extend these to level 80 and / or hotfix when we think it's relevant. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27303223962/physical-mitigation-change-intentional/))<br />
<br />
Resilience Hotfix<br />
My resilience post above was confusing. <br />
<br />
We had buffed resilience by 50% and then lowered it by 25%. This is a 12.5% buff from before the patch. To use clean numbers, if you had 40% damage reduction, we buffed it to 60% (a 50% increase) and then lowered it to 45% (a 25% decrease). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27187856197/class-balance-amp-hotfixes-10-18/))<br />
<br />
Balance in low-level BGs<br />
So can a blue state whether or not the very, very high damage outputs in low level pvp will be addressed or not? Rogues able to one-shot most enemies in sub-80 pvp: working as intended, or not? <br />
Nobody should be one-shotting at any battleground level, so yes that (and many other class abilities) will be addressed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27292695645/low-level-bgs-have-been-destroyed/))<br />
<br />

Weak mages on Beta<br />
This is a case of having to balance differently between 80 and 85. The original mage numbers were targeted at 85, which made them overpowered at 80. We nerfed them at 80, which then made them weak at 85. We now have two sets of numbers in place so that they should be relatively balanced at both levels.<br />
<br />
Mages are not the only class with this problem, sometimes in the opposite direction. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27303227540/mages-doing-less-damage-than-tanks-at-85/))<br />

Holy Paladin Hotfix<br />
Yes, we buffed the 5 paladin direct heals (FoL, HL, DL, HS, WoG). This is a change for both level 80 and 85. We are going to tone down Holy Radiance as I described in the other thread. It can be powerful without being 75% of paladin healing.<br />
<br />
I know it's customary for players to classify everything as either overpowered or garbage, but we believe there are actual numbers in between say 1 and 100, so give the changes a chance before you dismiss them. :)<br />
<br />
It is possible we will nerf Word of Glory for Prot and Ret at 85 to compensate for this buff since they probably don't need stronger Words. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27291817542/holy-paladin-hotfix/))</div></div><hr />

Already mentioned above, but rating for 2200+ is still there, so no t2shoulders/weapons (that is a good thing). <br />
<br />
Good for the hunters, they DID need it. Nope my main is a paladin, I'm sure if you look you can find plenty of me posting about it. I'm really glad they buffed the heals too. Maybe now some of my paladin healer friends will come back. Meh, several rolled mages/rogues and are having too much fun one shotting people in bgs.<br />
<br />
Glad to see they are toning down the damage in lower level bgs. Today alone I've talked to several people that were just now trying out bgs. They got so frustrated being one shotted over and over they just quit doing them. Pvp has such small numbers as it is, anything they can do to encourage more people is great.<br />
<br />
edit, just a note for those rejoicing at pvp gear requiring no rating. Think of how you might feel if your raid gear was suddenly purchasable with justice points. Imagine if your shadowmourne/dfo etc were purchasable with trinkets. I wish they would have lowered the rating requirement to say 500. That means anyone that even did a few weeks could have gotten it. Just handing them out for free though, meh. Yes that means on some of my guys I wouldn't have been able to get wrathful, but still. It really feels like a slap in the face to those that earned it. To them: I'm sorry blizz did this. You guys earned your gear, and you should have been able to keep it special. I'm just glad they at least reserved the t2 weapon/shoulders.</div></div><hr />

That's the way to go now, QQ to blizz to make it easier and everyone will be arcane mages whereas blizz should scale people down like moonkins instead of buffing everyone up. But hey what do I know, I enjoy GC fights in battlegrounds cause that's what all the pros are doing. Keep buffing classes and slapping on a bandaid on resilence to look like they're trying to balance. 85 will be just as broken if Blizz keeps adopting this attitude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They never addressed it before, curious as to why it is an issue now, or is it just that there are multiple classes 1 shotting people now?<br />

For god's sake, the Raven Lord is probably going to be just as rare as it was before, which wasn't even that rare. Right before Patch 4.0.1 I saw seven Raven Lords in Dalaran all at the same time, just by coincidence, and my realm isn't even that popular. There's always at least one in Dalaran anyway. <br />
<br />
Plus, not everyone actually has a friend who has a druid with the epic flying. I know I didn't for a long time. Just because they've removed the druid summoning from it now doesn't suddenly mean it's a piss easy mount to get. Since 4.0.1, I've run Anzu five times and I have yet to get the mount. (And yes, I knew about this way before Bibi posted it today.)<br />
<br />
I really hope the people whining about it here aren't just people who already have the mount, just because now they're going to feel less special about it... For some reason. Who cares what other people think about your mount? I'm trying to get this mount now because I really like it and it would make me feel good to finally get a rare drop mount and I'm really pleased they removed the druid summon because I never actually had a druid friend to go with. <br />
<br />
On another note, I'm glad about these hunter changes. My DPS needs to go back up please. :(</div></div><hr />

I'm not in the Cata beta, but before anyone starts linking the GC nonsense: <br />
<br />
&quot;While we don't have any additional announcements to make at this time, there are some additional balance tweaks we're working on. Some of our adjustments at level 80 ended up causing certain classes to be overpowered or underpowered at level 85.&quot;<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have any other changes to announce at this time. I am reluctant to mention additional classes or specs that we are looking at currently for fear of instilling excitement or panic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything I've read / heard from Combat rogues in the beta makes it sound like the spec is STILL sub-par, and getting wrecked by other hybrid classes... Which is honestly not cool. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because, unfortunatelly, there is no need to drag a druid anymore to summon it... wich means... for a lot of druid players, no more selling anzu runs...<br />
<br />
That's the only deal with all this QQ disguised as &quot;keep the rarity&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only thing that kept the mount rare was the drop rate, not the way it was summoned. It will still be rare in this way because we alread have tons of players farming it by dragging druid friends there or paying for the runs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder how they come to conclusions about things like this. What about people who still want a shot at the black scarab or the soon to be gone zg mounts. If youre gonna make something rare and challenging to get, then leave it that way for good. Make a new mount if you want everyone to have it.<br />
You still have to clear the instance, you just don't need the druid anymore. Fair in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for replying to basically everything to do with Anzu, but this is true. Still takes me a fair 20 minutes or so to get through the mobs to get to Anzu, which means this is not just a 'free for all' mount now. It's for the people that really want it and are willing to spend a bit of time each day trying to get it. :)</div></div><hr />

For god's sake, the Raven Lord is probably going to be just as rare as it was before, which wasn't even that rare. Right before Patch 4.0.1 I saw seven Raven Lords in Dalaran all at the same time, just by coincidence, and my realm isn't even that popular. There's always at least one in Dalaran anyway. <br />
<br />
Plus, not everyone actually has a friend who has a druid with the epic flying. I know I didn't for a long time. Just because they've removed the druid summoning from it now doesn't suddenly mean it's a piss easy mount to get. Since 4.0.1, I've run Anzu five times and I have yet to get the mount. (And yes, I knew about this way before Bibi posted it today.)<br />
<br />
I really hope the people whining about it here aren't just people who already have the mount, just because now they're going to feel less special about it... For some reason. Who cares what other people think about your mount? I'm trying to get this mount now because I really like it and it would make me feel good to finally get a rare drop mount and I'm really pleased they removed the druid summon because I never actually had a druid friend to go with. <br />
<br />
On another note, I'm glad about these hunter changes. My DPS needs to go back up please. :(<br />

No ones butt hurt. But Anzu has been a summon from a &quot;Druid&quot; quest line for over 3 years. And the raven lord was in many ways very similar to the Paladin and Warlock class mounts except it could be won by other players if they were present. The amount of time people invested in clearing the summon room and soloing Anzu now means nothing. Thats all im saying. Im sure there are many non druid players who are happy about this change, but it doesnt seem right to me.</div></div><hr />

So everyone can run it once a day to make an attempt at the mount instead of having to hunt down a druid to run it once a day to make an attempt at the mount?<br />

I dont think druids having flight form can be used against us. We shapeshift. Its a core mechanic of our class. Every form represents some type of combat style or travel style.

But as the reins of the raven lord mount was always available to whomever wins the roll, it was never exclusive. It just took a little more effort to get to than other things and the rarity stemmed from that.<br />
<br />
As I said, if this change somehow infringed on a core druid mechanic like your flight form, then yeah, you'd have something to be upset about.</div></div><hr />

Transmute cooldowns are at midnight server time, not at 4a server time (the time when dailies are reset).<br />
<br />
Don't get me started on your 'Quote by Blizzard Entertainment' spin of the data-mined transmute cooldown removal. I didn't fall for it but I know a number who had.<br />
<br />
As we've seen, the information being provided these days is half-hearted at best. So long MMO-Champion; I'll find my news elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went through all these 8 pages and still it seems that some people are wondering. I didn't have an arena team and most of the arena items were red (not available) to me and tooltip says they have rating requirements. Even then you can just buy them and use them if you have enough honor to buy it. Doesn't matter if it's red and shows rating requirements. You just click on it and verify the action and enjoy your rating-free arena items. 1800 weapons are available also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where do you get that the drop was lowered? I have seen countless posts of people getting it in less then 4-5 days. Me and 3 friends have been farming Anzu daily for 3 days now and 2 of us got him. (Sadly not me yet) <br />
<br />
If anything, from what i've seen the drop has increased drastically. <br />
<br />
For those druids crying about it, save your tears, it was lame that only druids could summon him anyway. You aren't special anymore oh boy end of the world isn't it? <br />
<br />
People cried the same when the ground mounts lowered from the 800G they used to be. <br />
Also people cried for months about how unfair PVP to PVE transfers were.<br />
Looks like everything worked out fine in the end. <br />
<br />
You'll get over it. <br />
Times change, move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Arena vendor are you folks visiting? I've checked the Arena vendors under Dalaran several times now and ALL gear, sans Relentless, requires either a BG, Arena or Personal rating.</div></div><hr />
