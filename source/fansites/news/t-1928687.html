Visitors get the chance to take a look at some of the character statues and more than 150 props, weapons and costumes from the movie. <br />

This Month in WoW - January 2016<br />
Happy new year! January rings in with a bang with fireworks over the cities of Azeroth, and ends with the deep of winter. Bundle up and warm yourself by the fire of activities ahead.<br />
<br />
In-Game Events<br />
<br />
Feast of Winter Veil (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/events/feast-of-winter-veil) [Ends January 2]<br />
For the first couple of days of January, you still have an opportunity to enjoy the Feast of Winter Veil. While enjoying a freshly nutmegged cup of nog, and crunching on a crumbly cookie or two, be sure to visit Greatfather Winter in Ironforge if you’re Alliance, or Great-father Winter in Orgrimmar if you’re Horde. While there, you’ll find a few treats, and surely a few tasks to take on as well.<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Why is so much utility being pruned from classes anyways? I get ability bloat.. but Utility is not bloat.<br />
Check out the class blogs. It's unlikely that whatever you're referring to is related to 'bloat' or 'pruning'. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518149628465153))<br />
It's more likely that it's related to delivering a strong class fantasy, distinct from the others'. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518292901715969))<br />
Sometimes, we've spread something around to so many classes, it no longer feels special. Trying to solve that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/681518563207831556))<br />

Activision Blizzard Acquires MLG Assets<br />
While nothing has been officially announced yet, eSportsObserver is reporting (http://esportsobserver.com/mlg-sells-substantially-all-assets-to-activision-blizzard-for-46-million/) that Activision Blizzard has acquired substantially all of Major League Gaming's assets for $46 million. MLG will be renamed to MLG Legacy Holdings, Inc. <br />
<br />
You may remember that earlier this year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5208-Curse-Blizzcon-Party-Valor-and-Crafted-Items-Engineering-Panel-Voice-Chat-eSports), Activision Blizzard announced the new eSports Division, headed up by Mike Sepso, a co-founder and president of MLG.<br />

Blizzard doesnt buy out entire developers, fire off half the company, put in their own people, then expect them to make games unrelated to what they're known for/kill the company off on purpose.<br />

They don't own the MLG, they've bought MLG assets. I would explain what the difference is but I don't have the patience right now, I encourage you to look it up if you're curious though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2016-01-01, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">seems like almost every company that gets massive success and makes a ton of cash becomes a corporation, and we all know what corporations are best at<br />
<br />
Any company that issues stock is a corporation - it's a legal distinction to protect the shareholders from liability from the actions of the entity. It's not a conspiracy that once a company incorporates, they become evil. Incorporating does not automatically make a company a bunch of money hungry villains. <br />
<br />
And yes - almost every business that's not a non-profit wants to make money. That is not a conspiracy, either. Who told you that profit from business is bad? Do you even know where you picked up that faulty thinking from? <br />
<br />
The anti-business and anti-corporate paranoia here is always entertaining, considering most of the people who are against them don't even know anything about what they're talking about.</div></div><hr />

Some of you may be really salty about some mounts being in the store, but seriously, get over yourselves, people said when sparklepony entered the shop that WoW would soon be pay to win, and it hasn't happened yet. If you think mounts, pets, and level boosts to skip the annoying grind = p2w then you haven't played any other microtransaction game out there, especially not asian ones where you literally cannot beat people in PvE or PvP who have paid money if you're a free player.</div></div><hr />

Company may have broke but it's a promissing idea and it has an established name. Doesn't strike me as a bad move tbh.<br />

Acquiring MLG is taking over the gaming world? I didn't know MLG was a company until I read this MMO-Champ post and I've been a gamer for over 30 years, then I read they are/were supposed a big deal in e-sports? <br />
<br />
Yeah I really never had an interest in e-sports, save for the one and only fact of it bringing more and mostly positive attention to long term hobby I enjoy. But from a personal interest standpoint I really don't get why folks watch e-sports, to me watching someone else have fun in a game is boring. Either I'm playing the game or I'll watch a friend or family member play to show me something they think is cool beyond that...keep your esports.</div></div><hr />

MLG is pretty big, but has lost out to ESL for CoD and after this acquisition will continue to lose sponsorship for major games.<br />
<br />
With a much bigger budget and more assets to throw at MLG, this actually isn't a bad move for them. How the community will react is another thing.</div></div><hr />

From same reason watching any sports can be interesting. Some people like different things but certain games can be really fun to watch when played by skilled players in competetive environment. It is not about watching them having fun. Besides with high stakes (and the fact that many players are treating playing that game more like a job rather than fun) I doubt they really have that much fun while playing in some tournaments. Money, serious business, drama etc. All potentially fun to watch and follow as a spectator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well to be fair there's several reasons for declaring bankruptcy and without the financial and managerial history known its not really accurate to assume it was due to a crappy president. Also though I'm only taking a guess I feel highly confident in my guess that Activision-Blizzard probably did long research into the company from a business valuation standpoint, they likely wouldn't toss millions out the window if they thought it was a stupid move. <br />
<br />
Finally, if you see value in a failing company -- that's the BEST time for you to buy, when they are go under (this makes a huge assumption that you know what you are doing, already have a business plan for it ,etc.) ....you get it dirt cheap. The worst time to try and acquire a business is when they are doing awesome -- if they even want to be owned at that point , they will be far more expensive to acquire.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and as far as acquisitions go - this was a fairly small one.<br />
<br />
And the uses for the staff/resources/expertise are fairly obvious; and can fairly easily be reoriented to market their existing games. Hell, theres a decent chance Activision-Blizzard have been wanting to up their e-sport presence (as e-sports are growing). MLG provides an already established brand, with already established expertise, with a reasonably sized viewership - significantly reducing the risks and efforts versus establishing their own brand.<br />
<br />
Even if the MLG branch is financially not self-sustained, they'll only need to 'market' around 1 million game sales (current and future) for the acquisition to pay off. Thats not an outrageous number with the number of titles at their disposal.<br />
<br />
Is there a risk? Yes. But they still paid less for MLG than the development cost of most of their games. So not a big one. Theres a considerable chance the disappearance of MLG would've cost the company -more- money through lost sales (reduced marketing power).</div></div><hr />

We are currently playing the most expensive expansion with the least amount of content to date. And the people who are responsible are still working for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

So much this. I don't know why but anything that says &quot;Activision-Blizzard&quot; on it is automatically seen as &quot;Blizzard&quot; by people on this site. There is even a comment about Blizzard trying to bankrupt themselves by buying the shares...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard want E-sport ? They create their own event and brand. They don't need MLG to do Esport.</div></div><hr />

If people aren't subbing, they aren't getting money for the next expansion, meaning we might get a worse product than WoD. Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is incorrect. The fishing tournament is not set by server time. It's set by region time. For instance, the US servers are set by the region timezone PST. So the fishing tournament starts at 2 PM PST, 3 PM MST, 4 PM CST, 5 PM EST. So even if your server is on Eastern time, it won't start at 2 PM. It will start at 5 PM. The fishing tournament occurs on all realms in a region simultaneously. (At least that's how the US region works, anyway.)<br />
<br />
Outside the obvious sources, I just won first place in the tournament a couple Sundays ago. I was running multiple accounts on my B.Net account at once, on different servers to optimize my chances at winning, and I can definitely confirm first hand all servers started at the same time regardless of server time. You guys should probably double-check this information before posting.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind paying for the expansions and even a monthly subscription, but if they ever get to THAT point... I'm quitting. F2p SWTOR is already like this and it sucks if you're not sub'd.</div></div><hr />
