Yes I did notice the change, its a cool change that it does not reduce our movement speed, helps us get away..or w/e quicker. But as for the damage change. I am not so sure.<br />
<br />
Overall as a Spriest/Hunter I am happy with most of these changed. Mind control got a nice little buff. Mind Spike should be taken upto a 40 yard range before long. No doubt. And thorns tbh, I really dont get that change. But hey.</div></div><hr />

Not much in the way of Paladin changes. I was never sure what &quot;Exclusive with Holy Shield&quot; meant with Inquisition. Liking Long Arm of the Law buff but that still doesn't change the fact that you judge a mage, he slows you, you pop Hand of Freedom and he steals it and continues slowing you -_-;.

The &quot;jousting&quot; in Hyjal is a lot different than the ToC counterpart. I was a little weary about doing the quests, but they're actually quite fun. You mount up on a hippogryph with a lance and lo and behold, it is based on the actual arcade game &quot;Joust&quot; as you need to keep pressing the 'Flap' action to stay up in the air.<br />
<br />
You go around killing flying birds as far as I remember, but they die as soon as you touch them which is quite nice. There are 3 waves and during the last one, a bunch of rocks fall from the ceiling that you have to dodge. It's pretty cool, I definitely enjoyed it. :D</div></div><hr />

Okay, the paladin qq is a little out of control. I MAIN a paladin, and I think ret will be perfectly fine with these changes. We have QQ'd for years for more damage (on par with other classes), a gap closer, and an interrupt and we got ALL THREE. The ret community should be overjoyed at this point.<br />

<br />
Chastise was a Priest Racial back in TBC. For Dwarf en Draenei Priets. I think it did some damage and snared just like now, but with much more damage.<br />
<br />
I lol'd @ # Thorns now lasts 20 sec, down from 10 minutes. Damage increased by 1400%</div></div><hr />

<br />
The damage from thorns will be significant, especially talented. It now has good leveling, pvp and tank-buffing uses. Before this patch, it was really useless for pvp and leveling.<br />
<br />
I think the range for all caster spells has more to do with leveling than raiding. One of the problems a lot of people were having leveling in beta (80+) was that casters weren't able to kill stuff before taking significant damage. Not sure though. No matter what, for raiding, it will easily be overcome because bosses will probably have 35 yard spells now.</div></div><hr />

Stop talking, really.. You do remember that they are making DPS classes not have to worry about mana anymore, correct? But making healers really worry about how much mana they are using. 2% mana regen with a 60% chance to proc on your main DPS spells is a very good replacement for the old Unrelenting Storm talent.<br />

It's most likely Earth, even though the name doesn't make sense for earth.

Unless you heard otherwise, I assume it's staying that way. <br />
<br />
Undoubtedly it's because they're using the same code that changes your non-human appearance human in the Caverns of Time: Culling of Stratholme instance. It just replaces the race of a substring and substitutes files.<br />
<br />
Example, assume the following are hairstyles for Worgen/Humans:<br />
<br />
Worgen1<br />
Worgen2<br />
Worgen3<br />
<br />
Human1<br />
Human2<br />
Human3<br />
<br />
<br />
If your appearance is Worgen2, then turning human will just shift you into Human2. It's simply just replacing the substring of &quot;Worgen&quot; distinguished by the number of the hairstyle.</div></div><hr />

I think you are misunderstanding me, cause I was actually just trying to understand what you meant to say. The message was a bit unclear to me but I see now that you just wanted to know why they didn't do it before. <br />
<br />
As an answer to that, I think it wasn't really needed as baseline untill they changed the talent tree system around. I just hope they manage to balance it out in PVP and PVE so it doesnt become useless in the end.</div></div><hr />

that's for blizzcon, it's a little &quot;event&quot; they make with the players, if you get that item, you should literally raise your hand and some blizz dude will give you your prize. there are other versions besides the legendary one (the rare (blue) one is for a poster)</div></div><hr />

Can be fun if you're questing/leveling and a player of the opposite faction attacks you and Thorns will kill him really fast. I know I gonna try it in PvP and see how it works. But always fun with some noob who kill himself on thorns :P</div></div><hr />

lol :(<br />
<br />
Look at the bright side. 30K+ Earth Shocks if this actually works properly? Sounds awesome. <br />
<br />
Wish they added this to Frost Shock instead though, just so you could yell FROST SHAWK everytime you killed somebody with it. <br />
<br />
20 Sec Thorns does seem weird. I'd imagine it's intentionally kept low at 20 seconds, because there will be a Glyph/Talent that increases it to a minute or so which makes that Glyph/Talent actually worth considering.</div></div><hr />

This makes no sense what so ever.

This is awesome - adding a mark without using a gcd? Just run up, shot something and the mark will appear. I like that!<br />

What are you saying &quot;oh god&quot; for? The list isn't entirely *new* items. Some of those have been around for years. There is actually very few new Cataclysm items in that list.<br />
<br />
People should just get over the fact that we will never, ever see Frostmourne or Ashbringer :P Their stories are over.</div></div><hr />

Chill out, I swear to god people are getting more and more dumb. Now, lets think....What could you have downloaded when you clicked on the LIST OF 8000 ITEMS link? hmmmmmmmmmmmmm........<br />
<br />
also, I know we probably wont see Ashbringer, but I can hope! :D <br />
