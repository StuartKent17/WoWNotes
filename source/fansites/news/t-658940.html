Does it mean that it will be deployed this week? No, Blizzard is still tweaking PTR servers and testing raid instances and the US have rolling restarts scheduled for this week anyway. If nothing goes wrong on PTRs I would start to expect it on live servers next week. <br />

Patch 3.2 PTR Notes Update<br />
The official patch notes (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17899680776&amp;sid=1) have been updated once again with a few extra changes.<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
The Heroic dungeon daily quest will now reward 2 Emblems of Triumph and the normal daily dungeon quest will reward 1 Emblem of Conquest. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Seal of Vengeance and Seal of Corruption: These seals have been redesigned to deal substantially more damage. Now, once a paladin has 5 copies of the debuff from these seals on his or her target, on each swing the paladin will deal 33% weapon damage as Holy, with critical strikes dealing double damage. In addition, the damage-over-time effect is now considered a melee attack instead of a spell attack and the effects from these seals can only be triggered by auto-attacks and Hammer of the Righteous. <br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
Casting bars under the target frame, focus frame, and nameplates will now display as shielded if the cast cannot be interrupted. <br />
New Feature Icons: Options recently added to any of the options menus will now display a yellow exclamation point next to them to indicate that they are new features. <br />
<br />

PvP Healing<br />
If you are a healer, you are often going to be a target. You aren't designed to be able to totally fend off every attack while keeping everyone alive.<br />
<br />
This thread reads a little like &quot;Healing is hard&quot; (which is true), &quot;and often unappreciated&quot; (which is true), &quot;and therefore healers should be really hard to counter and otherwise deal with.&quot; That last part is where you lose me. If healing can't be stopped or countered, then nobody dies until you run out of mana. If every PvP encounter becomes a mana drain race we don't think it will be very fun. If PvE encounters never challenge healers then you'll get lots of accolades, but probably also be pretty bored.

Seal of Vengeance / Corruption and Ret DPS<br />
Only white attacks can stack the Sea of Vengeance / Corruption dot. However special abilities should still trigger the bonus weapon damage. I'm not sure the current PTR build you have reflects that last bit.<br />
<br />
The goal was not to nerf Ret for PvE. We do want the ramp up time to be significant for PvE or it won't solve the PvP problem we're trying to fix. However, once you get the stack up, your damage should be pretty decent. On very short kills (say trash or something like Thorim arena) you won't be able to get the full benefit from the dot, but any class with a finishing move typically loses that damage as well. Balance is important for both short and long fights, but it's normal to use different rotations or abilities for those two extremes. (In other words, we're okay with a long ramp up time for this ability.)<br />
<br />
We will continue to monitor Ret numbers coming out of the PTR and even once the patch goes live and make changes if necessary. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18601088546-sovcorr-confirmed-explanation.html))<br />

[US] Rolling Restarts - 7/28/2009<br />
We will be performing a brief maintenance on select realms listed below on Tuesday, July 28th at 5:00am PDT untill approximately 9:00am PDT. For all realmst not listed below, we will begin a series of rolling restarts at 5:00am PDT for all United States and Latin American realms and 10:00am PDT for all Oceanic realms. We anticipate each of these realms will be down for no more than 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Alexstrasza, Alleria, Balnazzar, Blackhand, Cho'gall, Destromath, Dethecus, Garona, Gorgonnash, Gul'dan, Hellscream, Illidan, Kael'thas, Kirin Tor, Ravencrest, Spinebreaker, Stormreaver, Whisperwind<br />
<br />
[EU] Extended Maintenances and Instance Capacity<br />
Recently there has been a number of extended maintenance periods for certain realms. Some of these we informed you about in advance and some we were unable to until during the actual maintenance period. We want to take the time to explain the reasoning behind these extended maintenance periods, and also those that will need to occur in the future.<br />
<br />
These extended maintenances are directly linked to the message we posted in early July (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=9941934722 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=9941934722)) about our investigations in regard to instance capacity and our plans to implement hardware modifications to achieve positive change for your play experience. As we said we would do in that message, we are now informing and updating you of our progress.<br />
<br />
These modifications are typically a two stage process, requiring two lots of extended maintenance for each group of realms being worked on. For the realms listed below, the first stage was completed successfully on Wednesday the 15th of July during a pre-announced extended maintenance period.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday the 22nd of July we also began to complete the second and final stage of this process on the affected realms. However, we encountered unforeseen difficulties in implementing the modifications. We were left with two options; either to further extend the maintenance period well into the evening and thus the busiest playing hours, or to take just a couple of extra hours to roll back the changes so that the realms could be back up and playable quickly. Since we did not want to disrupt your ability to play the game during the prime time, we decided on the latter option.<br />
<br />
Since the final stage of these modifications did not complete successfully, we will need to do a further extended maintenance for the realms listed below. This is currently planned for the next maintenance period on Wednesday 29th of July. Because of this, we wish to inform you in advance that the realms listed below will again experience extended maintenance as we implement changes that we believe will bring positive change for your play experience, especially in regards to the ability to enter dungeon and raid instances.<br />
<br />
After these modifications are implemented successfully, we aim to post up a feedback thread so that you can share with us your thoughts on how they have affected your play experience. At that stage, we will greatly appreciate it if you are able to help us with your feedback.<br />
<br />
Though these modifications will be rolled out to all realms eventually, the current group of realms we are implementing the hardware changes on are these:<br />
<br />
Balnazzar, Bloodfeather, Darksorrow, Defias Brotherhood, Earthen Ring, Frostwhisper, Genjuros, Haomarush, Hellscream, Laughing Skull, Lightning's Blade, Magtheridon, Neptulon, Nordrassil, Quel'Thalas, Ragnaros, Ravencrest, Runetotem, Shadowsong, Shattered Hand, Silvermoon, Skullcrusher, Spinebreaker, Stormrage, Stormreaver, Stormscale, Sylvanas, Terenas, The Maelstrom, The Venture Co., Thunderhorn, Turalyon, Twisting Nether, Vashj</div></div><hr />

this. unless they annouce end of arena season today/tomorrow, I would expect patch to still be at least 3 weeks away, as I believe this is the standard time to give for ending an arena season.</div></div><hr />

Seal of Veng/Corr<br />
To clarify more, now to have full benefits you need to do 5 meele autoatacks which landed on enemy with sucsses.<br />
In this condition blizzard not just nerf again pvp its more clearly this affected pve dps which is allready low on ptr atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree,<br />
<br />
It will also be unwise for Blizzard to release this patch at this stage in the summer period anyway, early august is not a good time when a lot of people are out enjoying the sun are on holidays, the best way to attract them back is during the first few days of september when the new school term is about to start which marks the end of summer.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt it'll be out before the last week of August and a September launch seems more logical.</div></div><hr />

Releasing a patch in the summer months never goes down that well due to a lot of people not playing much, an example is my guild who are slap bang in the middle of our summer raiding break.<br />
<br />
and like dr0nzer said before me, releasing a patch on the 1st few days of september is the perfect way to lure people back in to the game after the summers on its way out</div></div><hr />

While true, by that time Blizzcon will be over and any wow related announcement made there is likely to have a much bigger impact on the player base then 3.2.<br />

While this is true, blizzard did decide to leave the mount rewards in the game when 3.2 is released, so even if the patch goes live next week, it wont really affect it that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. Although I'm not sure, I'd expect it pre-Blizzcon (21/22 Aug btw), but I also agree with the people who say we'd need a prep for the end of the arena season. Although again, because top-tier weaponary isn't available immediately with this patch, they may get away with it... Oh, I have no idea...<br />
<br />
I'm liking that they've reduced the Normal Daily to 1 conquest mark, but still having the Heroic Daily giving 2 of the new marks seems a little odd. How many marks are being dropped on each boss in the new instance? Because it seems strange that weekly you could make more doing hc dailies than the new raid... :S</div></div><hr />

Which would have been an issue if people needed the month to get their mounts. Now that we know they are not removing them (at least in 3.2) it doesn't really matter that they did not wait the required month.</div></div><hr />

Now that my three accounts have expired, I don't quite care. Either time is going by too quickly, or it seems like all their effort (HYPE) that went into 3.1 was grossly over-exagerated. And now 3.2...<br />
<br />
Remember the days of having to SIT OUT on a BWL raid because there were too many people in-line? And guess what, I did. I would wait around nearly an entire week waiting to get in.<br />
<br />

I have never heard it said that Arena Seasons have to be running all the time. Just because 1 ended does not mean that they will immediately start the next one. WotLK was live for what 1? or 2? months before they started the season. I personally think that it will be middle to end of August, but I do not work in Blizz's development dept. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
How about another carrot on a stick anyone? I'm tempted to go back to Everquest, 'cause at least there I can waste time farming named mobs for tradeable drops. Maybe I'll just go back to school and finish my Masters'.<br />

LOL damn right! I think they even said it somewhere in their companies' motto: &quot;World of Warcarft: The LAST game you'll ever play&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though, the main reason I've played so many years is that my girlfriend enjoys playing the mini-quests durring the seasonal events, and it's one of the only multi-player games I can get her to play.</div></div><hr />

They said &quot;We will inform you 4 WEEKS before we release the patch, so you can make your final attempts on your rusted proto-drake&quot; or something like that..<br />
<br />
<br />
I posted about this just a few posts ago.<br />
<br />
Blizz has already said (originally posted on July 22nd)...<br />
<br />
After further discussion, we decided not to remove the rusted and ironbound proto-drake rewards for the normal and heroic Glory of the Ulduar Raider meta achievements when patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, launches, and currently have no plans to remove them in the foreseeable future. However, we will continue to evaluate the situation and if a decision is made to remove these rewards at any point in the future, we'll provide a one month warning so players will have time to make some final attempts.<br />
<br />
So there is no need to give people a months notice to prepare as they will still be able to try and get the rusted/ironbound drakes after the 3.2 patch arrives.</div></div><hr />

Although I'm not sure, I'd expect it pre-Blizzcon (21/22 Aug btw), but I also agree with the people who say we'd need a prep for the end of the arena season. Although again, because top-tier weaponary isn't available immediately with this patch, they may get away with it... Oh, I have no idea...<br />
<br />
I'm liking that they've reduced the Normal Daily to 1 conquest mark, but still having the Heroic Daily giving 2 of the new marks seems a little odd. How many marks are being dropped on each boss in the new instance? Because it seems strange that weekly you could make more doing hc dailies than the new raid... :S<br />
<br />
<br />
Triumph x 2 only for the daily HC, not on bosses = 14 per week (and ofc raiders can do heroic 5 mans too ^^)</div></div><hr />

They got plenty of damage, plenty of control, auto attack a 50% healing debuff that does decent damage, and a 70% slow, AND they got a massive amount of cooldowns, which if the rogue is good, they can use to survive for quite a bit of time. Think this will ever happen? <br />
<br />
I like how the Blue completely ignored this part of the question in regards to healing in PvP.</div></div><hr />

Seal of Vengeance and Seal of Corruption: These seals have been redesigned to deal substantially more damage. Now, once a paladin has 5 copies of the debuff from these seals on his or her target, on each swing the paladin will deal 33% weapon damage as Holy, with critical strikes dealing double damage. In addition, the damage-over-time effect is now considered a melee attack instead of a spell attack and the effects from these seals can only be triggered by auto-attacks and Hammer of the Righteous. <br />

Only white attacks can stack the Sea of Vengeance / Corruption dot. However special abilities should still trigger the bonus weapon damage. I'm not sure the current PTR build you have reflects that last bit.<br />

<br />
No point in trying to scribble an psuedo-psychological analysis of the possible motivation of rumor-starting.<br />
<br />
I'll guess we'll find out soon enough anyway, and I doubt anyone wants the 3.2 patch to come next week as much as I do. So I'd rather wish that my friend hadn't given me the 'news' regarding a month delay, due to database bugs with the patch, the new integrated questhelper being broken (probably won't make it in the 3.2 patch, but will be added as minor patch later) and that they first wanna spend a few weeks on heavily tweaking and testing stats like resilience and arena ratings etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said a 4 week warning before they remove the drakes. They did not say 4 week warning before patch 3.2 goes live. I can't remember the exact text of the blue posts but they were thinking about 3.2 removal and then decided against it. It looks like they may be speeding up before 3.3 hits. 3.2's raid content probably won't last long, and my opinion is that its main purpose is to speed up the transition from new 80 to well geared raider, and to help your alts along with that too (hence new chest heirlooms and the 2 &quot;missing weapons&quot;). I don't think its purpose is to keep us busy for long, which is why the drakes are still going to be achievable. <br />
<br />
I don't get what the issue with 3.2 going live next week (if it does) is. Is it typical MMO Champion troll &quot;i got it da propa way&quot; reasoning, or is there something I'm not seeing? I'm welcoming this patch with open arms, especially as it may renew level 80 for my priest. Wouldn't be surprised if we got IC in October/November, to be honest. <br />
<br />
My proposed time line :<br />
<br />
Today - 3.2 testing finished &gt; Next week/week after - 3.2 Live &gt; Week after that - 3.2.1 &gt; August 21st-ish - BlizzCon &gt; Few weeks later - 3.2.2 &gt; Not long after (maybe beginning of October) - 3.3 on PTR &gt; November-ish - 3.3 off PTR &gt; Before Xmas - 3.3 Live.<br />
<br />
Just my idea.</div></div><hr />

It's simple now enough, but on top of it all, you can get some of the best game in the gear, or the BEST gear last patch, within effectively a week.

Noone was pugged fully 25m ulduar on my server, heck most guilds don't, and thats with people who already have this gear. How are they expecting casuals, to clear harder content with the same gear that people are already using to clear easier content.. and unsucesfully doing so.

In TBC, you could farm heroics and get T6 equal gear as well, don`t assume that because someone hasn`t done an instance or isn`t in full hardmode Ulduar gear.. that you`re a better player than they are. Don`t assume that &quot;I`ve been playing since vanilla WoW when shit was hard to kill&quot;, that you`re an amazing, elite player in the top 100 guilds in the world. I quit in the summer, because hey.. it`s summer. I`ll play again when school starts, and I`ll continue to raid and NOT CARE that BAD PLAYERS have EPICS THAT WON`T MATTER in the next patch, when we get our new gear. So what, they have a few crappy conquest badge gear that, aside from the 2 tier tokens, are all WORSE than the items in the instance.<br />
<br />
Basically, it doesn`t matter if bad players have that gear, know why? because they still won`t be in good guilds or be anything but nothing, because they WON`T have Ulduar achievements and they WON`T have any gear to prove it. So seriously, stop looking at all the bad in everything and get off the QQ train, because none of us care, and certainly Blizz doesn`t.</div></div><hr />

Yes because clearly every single player in the game, who has not cleared all Ulduar hardmodes, yogg+0, Algalon etc are bad players. It does not in one single instance mean that players have commitments in real life that keep them from raiding 4 nights a week. And there are certainly no players who (and I realize this concept may be very foreign to you) have girlfriends, wives or kids.<br />
<br />
It is clear you are one of those unspeakably elite players, who measures the value of all things in life by the purple pixels others are wearing compared to his own purple pixels. Pretty sad.</div></div><hr />

How are they expecting casuals, to clear harder content with the same gear that people are already using to clear easier content.. and unsucesfully doing so. NERF NERF NERF EVERYTHING. gg bliz. <br />

<br />
Because some random guy getting some (let's be serious, you can't get full t8.5 equivalent set (2 pieces of tier 8.5 + some random pieces which will not net you a full 16 piece set)) of the best gear last patch is clearly ground &amp; game-breaking, right? Especially for you who will not feel so special anymore in your current set. If you are so pro &amp; elitist as you showed in your post, in patch 3.2 you will be wearing 3.2 gear. If you aren't - well tough luck.</div></div><hr />

3.2 effectively ending the era of when gear was even semi easy to get, now its just super easy.<br />

Noone was pugged fully 25m ulduar on my server, heck most guilds don't, and thats with people who already have this gear.

NERDRAGE!<br />

Translation: Too many people will have gears as good as mine, and I won't feel as elite as I deserve to feel. And then when people laugh at me in gym class next month, I won't have my security blanket of WoW greatness.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">worlddan</div><div class="date">2009-07-29, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My proposed time line :<br />
<br />
Today - 3.2 testing finished &gt; Next week/week after - 3.2 Live &gt; Week after that - 3.2.1 &gt; August 21st-ish - BlizzCon &gt; Few weeks later - 3.2.2 &gt; Not long after (maybe beginning of October) - 3.3 on PTR &gt; November-ish - 3.3 off PTR &gt; Before Xmas - 3.3 Live.<br />
<br />
Just my idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is a very credible time line. TBC was released mid-January and I suspect that the next expansion is headed for that time frame. We already see the seeding in 3.2 for the new races as they promised us and I doubt they would do that much more than six months in advance. This time frame would also allow them to pre-sell the next expansion during the holiday period in USA/Europe and while interest in 3.3 was still high. This means 3.3 needs to drop by mid-November to give people two months to finish up WOTLK. That would mean 3.2 drops no later than late August.<br />
<br />
My own opinion is that 3.2 is less a stand-alone patch than a transition patch to get people geared up and ready for 3.3 and the new expansion. As such, there is no real reason to delay it so long as it's ready. Given the timing of Blizzcon I find it hard to believe that they want it taken up with questions about 3.2 and would rather have the discussion focused on the future. So I unless there is some serious technological issues I would think the plan would be to have 3.2 drop in early August.<br />
<br />
Yes, this does pose some minor problems with Arena. But I don't believe such details are driving the decision making process.</div></div><hr />

Wait what? WOTLK came out 9 months ago are you seriously suggesting they're getting ready to wind it up and give us another expansion? BC lasted two years, they're not going to milk the current expansion for any shorter time than that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You all realize, they can release the patch without the Arena gear in it... they have done it before and im sure they can do it again.<br />
<br />
The way i see it, the patch will come out - they will announce arean season is ending, and in 2 weeks the new season will begin.</div></div><hr />
