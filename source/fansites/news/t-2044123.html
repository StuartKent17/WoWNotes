Legion Developer Interviews<br />
Some other sites interviewed the developers about Demon Hunters and got a few answers that haven't been covered in other interviews. <br />
<br />
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/news/legion-entwickler-interviews-zum-damonenjager-in-der-zusammenfassung-15559)<br />
<br />
There are still parts of the Dark Whispers event that players didn't figure out during the time it was active on beta. <br />
When you turn into a Dreadlord you get 6,666% additional health and raid boss power level abilities. <br />
Vengeance is probably a mid-tier tank when it comes to complexity. They have a lot utility in Mythic+ dungeons which makes them a little more complex, but a little less complex in raid tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
PCGamer (http://www.pcgamer.com/how-wows-craziest-world-event-borrows-from-blizzards-rts-past/)<br />
<br />
Legion invasion events will scale from Level 10 to 100.<br />
Garrison building tech saved the day and allowed for the invasions to spawn in large buildings and really take over the zones.<br />
The team didn't spend enough time in Warlords or make use of the assets and story there well. <br />
Legion is going to be a longer expansion with more patches so that the story is told well <br />
The Warlords quests that just required you to fill a bar with no story weren't great. <br />
The last two expansions together have taught the team where they need to spend their time and effort in terms of evolving WoW.<br />
Not doing Demon Hunters until now means that their mobility and other things that weren't possible with Burning Crusade tech could be realized well. <br />

<br />
Legion - Infernal Mounts<br />
Legion adds infernal mounts as drops from Gul'dan in The Nighthold. The Hellfire Infernal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171827-hellfire-infernal) drops in Mythic and Felblaze Infernal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/213134-felblaze-infernal) in Heroic and Normal. There are three other colors with no assigned sources. <br />

<br />
I always find it cool how they manage to repurpose the tech they made for one thing for something else, for example the whole concept of the personal garrison zone is just the zone-sharding tech on steroids.</div></div><hr />

Well, it let them do more with them than just have demons spawn in zones. With invasions it actually spawns huge citadels that work as actual buildings.</div></div><hr />

lol. Maybe they should add a special mechanic that if you get hit by 10 abilities that are avoidable, you dont get it.</div></div><hr />

That would be better than having a massive patch with nothing the following 14 months. They also need to diversify the loot, more pets, mounts and transmog skins. Gear is so easy to obtain its no longer the driving force it once was.</div></div><hr />

Legion is going to be a longer expansion with more patches so that the story is told well<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as the patches are fairly frequent, maybe 3-4 months throughout, I've no problem with a longer expansion. The problem has never been that expansions last too long, but rather that the final patch of each expansion lasts too long. I genuinely hope we get some like the Lion's Landing / Domination Point style of story telling again. MoP had some incredible story telling, you can argue that the story itself wasn't the best but it was the best told.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Warlords quests that just required you to fill a bar with no story weren't great.<br />
<br />
I thought that ever since they were implemented. Sure, a lot of player skim over the details, but the context was important to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends what you expect in a patch, FF14 does 3-4month patches and its arguably detrimental, features are rushed, testings not done well enough and they end up shipping what sounded great on paper but it being very lacklustre in execution which may not be the case had they had an extra month or so.<br />
<br />
Patch pacing is definiately a problem though if they expect an expansion to last 2 years they dont want to be releasing all the planned raid content within the 1st.</div></div><hr />

But will have to wait and see what they come up with, and the DL comic had me laughng.. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They do internal testing with FF14 and fix any bugs before it goes out. Any found after get hotfixed which is usually a mini patch or 2. I'd say their patches are just as polished as Blizzards and they do public and internal testing. And no feature has come out so far that is borderline unplayable. Also Blizzard have said for years they don't want a drought and at this point it's all just bullshit until they actually sort that out.</div></div><hr />

I'd bet money that you're correct. Also, the last expansion.<br />

<br />
Final Fantasy does tiny patch that you can clear within a week every 3-4 months. Wow does 4-6 months at the start, and not a whole lot of people end up clearing the content.<br />
<br />
Excited for a longer expansion, no real reason to make expansions shorter as long as there is some sort of new content every 6-8 months or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not to turn this into an FF14 vs WoW debate, most of the patches are well polished, but to say features aren't rushed, and the testing is up to standard is questionable. Diadem, LoV, Hunts, PotD, Gold Saucer all highly anticipated features, non of which came close to what was described on paper and in the case of Diadem and Hunts highly rushed, which is the point I was getting at is had they had that extra month to develop it could have been much closer to what was described, it does feel more like they got to a point where it works just ship it and have left it in the half assed state still because they just dont have time to devote to it while sticking to deadlines. <br />
<br />
Then theres testing, WAR original incarnation near unplayable any hard content, Twintania twisters broken, elevation bug still not fixed, T2 enrage broken, T13 pushing the phase, Gordias Savage 3/4 way overtuned, A4S royal pentacle, exploit/major bug, Midas A6 had to be largely retuned because again way overtuned, Ramuh Titan Egi being the tank to use trivialising the fight bug, Titan being able to bug him out from attacking, Titan the whole 1st half of ARR granted servers were a big factor but proper testing should have found that it was a big issue for anyone not in JP or sat ontop of thier exchange. Yes some got fixed, many they just said fuck it its too late strategies have been made (twintania, T2, A4S) and some of them are pretty much borderline unplayable because they destroy the integrity of the fight.<br />
<br />
I do enjoy the faster patches in FF14 though granted the content is not for me as I require at least some challenge in the game I play and 4 hard fights every 6month with what I personally find braindead easy everything else inbetween isnt something Im willing to pay for atm. But I honestly feel if they hadn't confined them self to a 3month patch cycle some content could be way better than we got if they could have spent more time on it.<br />
<br />
All I was getting at is if they do plan to release faster patches, they don't want to confine themself to an artifical deadline, they should be allowed the leway to say we don't think this is ready its going to be extra (insert time period that isn't taking the piss) and we as players should be able to have that bit of extra patience for them to get it right, rather than immediately jump on the forums to whine as if Blizzard just barged in your house, kicked your dog and pissed on Grandma.</div></div><hr />

There is patience then there is 14 months. And nearly just as long droughts since Wrath. They said themselves they don't want droughts so they need to get off their asses and fix it at this point.</div></div><hr />

Longer doesn't mean better when it comes to wow.<br />
<br />
Could just mean longer with no real content to play. Your patches coudl very likely be more twitter feeds and camera angles and some other BS as they claim it's their biggest patch to date.<br />

Their wording is not all that great there to be honest.</div></div><hr />

It is easily the most strenous area of the game, even solo in there is more stress than a 40 raid. I could see this become a problem, even if it's not noticeable on all systems of course.</div></div><hr />

True. I miss the things that happened like the plague in IF. Those were the days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well thank goodness that the Devs realized this. After the great storytelling in Mists including patches 5.1 and 5.3 which gave us story in different ways (really like the story quests interspersed within daily questing model), Warlords was garbage. I'm really hopeful that Blizz means to really go back to delivering a solid story through an expansion. With all of the lore that we are getting from the class order halls, artifacts, raids, dungeons, questing, and world quests just to name a few, I am very excited to absorb all of that sweet sweet story content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree, I don't understand why they then put them all over the Broken Isles as well. Oh yeah, cause it saves them time and they can do less work.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Not A Cat</div><div class="date">2016-08-08, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at least they kind of admitted that WoD's story was awful, and they're done spouting the &quot;we want expansions to come out faster&quot; bullshit</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ejpaints</div><div class="date">2016-08-08, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They do internal testing with FF14 and fix any bugs before it goes out. Any found after get hotfixed which is usually a mini patch or 2. I'd say their patches are just as polished as Blizzards and they do public and internal testing. And no feature has come out so far that is borderline unplayable. Also Blizzard have said for years they don't want a drought and at this point it's all just bullshit until they actually sort that out.<br />
<br />
I've seen FFXIV push some pretty bad patch content. Diadem released in a giant loot piñata that promoted everyone flock to a single location. Simultaneously group members would go gathering leaving the few left trying to kill things unable to obtain credit. They ended up hotfixing it but did so in a manner that it turned into a wasteland quickly. I quit shortly after as the relic grind was more tedious than fun, but I wouldn't say they polish anything better than blizz. They simply do an even worse job with communication &amp; the community accepts it. It's a good game, don't get me wrong, but it definitely has it's issues just like WoW.</div></div><hr />

Oh for sure. Diadem and Lord of Verminion were good concepts but just ended up being shite. Gordias savage had the issue of the fights being more dps checks than mechanics as well.</div></div><hr />

I recall seeing those complaints but I didn't end up going into savage gordias. I quit about halfway through the &quot;kill this boss 800 times to collect X items for next step&quot;. Might've been better if I hadn't been on a relatively dead server. I enjoyed the gameplay of the characters, but the game was just too much grind, not enough meat for my personal tastes. I'll probably play through the next expansion if they release one but I established in Heavensward that I just don't have enough free time to play FF seriously.</div></div><hr />
