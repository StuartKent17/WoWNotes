<br />
Seriously what justifies the higher cost than last year?<br />
<br />
If they are sincere about &quot;every panel, every stage, and every amazing moment&quot; then it'd mean needing more camera crews because in the previous years there were always some things that were left off of the digital stream and we're left to watch poor quality bootleg recordings on youtube like peasants.</div></div><hr />

i miss the 90s and early and mid 2000s when blizzard at least managed to keep up the pretense of not being a shameless bloodsucking vampire. think ill just buy and replay P5 ultimate for my ps4, cause at least ill be able to do something with that beyond this weekend.<br />

all the way to the balls, just like blizz likes it. don't gag now, ya here?<br />
<br />
Never minded paying £25 for it. Seems reasonable. Saves all my friends having to buy one as they like the panels but have zero interest in the rewards.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know personally why it's had a sudden £10 price hike though. <br />
<br />
Also Star Citizen is an unfinished product that tried to charge people to watch it's stream. Not to mention Blizzard have said countless times that Blizzcon operates at a loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was made free literally this year. Other years it costed. Hardly fair to act that it's a friendlier approach when it's the first time.<br />
<br />
It is a friendly approach don't get me wrong. But they are just as guilty of charging for it. And knowing them the Mogstation prices will be ridiculous to compensate. <br />
<br />
They know how much people want Cloud's bike from AC for example. Will probably be the same cost as the ticket alone.<br />
<br />
And in return you don't get the closing ceremony with The Primals.</div></div><hr />

Yes I did say it is now free, meaning it wasn't in the past. <br />
Are they not going to stream concert with The Primals this year? in the past they've always had day 1 ending with a piano concert and day 2 ending with the Primals live.</div></div><hr />

That's what I read somewhere. No concert in return for the free stream.<br />

Also as I said I bet you any money the mogstation merch covers the fanfest ticket prices.<br />

I’ve attended a few Blizzcons and a 10$ increase in the virtual ticket isn’t a big deal at all for me but based on the principal of the matter I might skip it based on what the other rewards are as I’m not particularly happy with BfA at the moment.</div></div><hr />

It's very likely not only a 2 day advertisement for them now, but also profitable.<br />

$40 was already a joke. $50 flat out says they are exploiting their fans and don't care.<br />

The euro price is 40, the USD is 50. But I think they'd better have something really nice in the virtual goodies to explain the +10 anyway. If not, don't think I'm getting it this year either.</div></div><hr />

Why? What is being added for it to be so worth it? A Diablo announcement?

Paying 40 Euros is very close to the standard edition of BfA which is 45 Euro, I see Activision is really pressing on them to get them moneeyyzzz both from Beta for Azeroth and Blizzcon.<br />
Think I will refer to free twitch streams this year instead, I doubt they will top off last year with bombastic announcements that will turn out to be mostly meh on release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you seriously saying that a 25% or so increase in the price of the ticket is justifiable, especially when as a wow fan apart from raid content there is most certainly not gonna be any new reveals?? I happily bought it last year but this time it's really taking the piss. Content and in-game loot would have to be seriously exclusive to justify the price and we all know that content will be available accessible here for free almost within the hour so most of us would essentially be paying $50 just for in-game loot which is a hell of a lot to pay for.</div></div><hr />
