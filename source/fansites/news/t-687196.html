To encourage players not to shy away from the many invigorating adventures to be had in The Oculus, we have applied a change to enhance the rewards players are provided when selected for this dungeon via the Random Heroic option in the Dungeon Finder. Once Ley-Guardian Eregos is defeated, one loot bag per character will be provided in his chest in addition to the current rewards. Each loot bag will offer players rare gems, two additional Emblems of Triumph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47241/emblem-of-triumph/), and a chance of being rewarded the Reins of the Blue Drake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43953/reins-of-the-blue-drake/). These fine treasures could be yours should you honor your fellow party members by besting the challenges contained within The Oculus! Keep in mind, however, that these extra loot bags will only be awarded to each party member if Oculus is selected by the Dungeon Finder when players choose the Random Heroic option.<br />
<br />
In light of this change, the Reins of the Azure Drake will now have a chance of dropping in both 10- and 25-player versions of The Eye of Eternity. <br />
<br />
Reminder - Plagueworks unlock this week!<br />
The next raid wing of the Icecrown Citadel will unlock after this week's maintenance and will give players a chance to fight:<br />
Rotface (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=899)<br />
Festergut (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=892)<br />
Professor Putricide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=898), your new favorite boss if you like Futurama (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PStC-LNZ2s).<br />
<br />
Important - You only have 10 attempts to kill Professor Putricide because of the Icecrown Citadel Gating (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=911). (The number was changed from 5 to 10 since the original announcement) <br />
<br />
It also means that people working on Shadow's Edge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49888/shadows-edge/) will finally have a chance to get Festergut's Acidic Blood (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50226/festerguts-acidic-blood/) and Rotface's Acidic Blood (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50231/rotfaces-acidic-blood/) to complete The Sacred and the Corrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/). <br />

Blue posts<br />
Two more posts for today.<br />

Rage starvation in heroics<br />
Rage is what playing a warrior is all about. When you don't want to have to worry about managing rage, you're saying you don't want to be limited by your class resource and just want to be able to hit whatever button you want whenever you want.<br />
<br />
I will acknowledge (and have before) that being rage starved when you outgear an instance can be frustrating but that says more about the high levels of avoidance and the high amount of damage that can be blocked with great gear. We don't want warriors to have to downgrade their gear to tank older content. We don't think that means the rage mechanic needs to be thrown out the window though. The opposite should be true too, however. Rage shouldn't be an obstacle that you eventually overcome with enough gear. Managing rage should always be at the forefront of warrior (or bear druid) concerns. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22049934742-way-rage-is-gained-simply-needs-to-be-changed.html))<br />
<br />
Protection Warrior<br />
We've addressed this issue already recently, but if you need to hear more on the topic:<br />
<br />
1) Prot warriors aren't exactly dominating Arena play by almost any stretch.<br />
<br />
2) Yes, there are some good Prot warriors. There are many more good mages and rogues.<br />
<br />
3) However, part of this job isn't just reacting to yesterday's news. Part of it is trying to predict the trends that will emerge a few weeks or months from now.<br />
<br />
4) Furthermore, a class / spec doesn't need to be dominating to be super annoying to play against. We try and fix those situations too.<br />
<br />
5) We've said several times we want to get more if not all specs into PvP, and that includes Protection. If seeing traditional tank specs in PvP at all just offends you, well, sorry.<br />
<br />
6) While Protection's damage has gone up recently due to new gear being available, the same is true of every class in the game. The control and counter-control abilities Protection has that are getting so much attention aren't anything new. This isn't a new spec that suddenly became viable in 3.3. It's been around for awhile and some players have been playing it for awhile.<br />
<br />
7) What has changed recently is so many threads popping up each day calling Prot the new overpowered faceroll spec or whatever. I can buy that Prot is catching on and more players are figuring it out after watching the experts use all their tricks, but when you sit back and read all of these posts, you also get a nagging suspicion that Prot PvP has just become the new punching bag of the month on the DD forum. I'm just asking you to keep your feedback in perspective. When every potential balance problem is portrayed as the worst thing to ever happen that's ruining the game for you, then it's hard for us to actually detect whether a problem is perceived as major or minor.<br />
<br />
8 ) We haven't announced any changes yet. We might make some. Until that time, feel free to keep discussing the issue, but know that it will carry far more weight if the gist of your argument is something other than a generic &quot;Prot has been ridiculous for so long. I can't believe they haven't nerfed it yet.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418971750-prot-warriors.html))</div></div><hr />

Wow you have to use flying a bit and hit a coupe buttons that your drake has, that's a damn complicated job for some people i guess.. Jeez, even a monkey could have done that for a banana bunch. But looks like we are up to that point, and have extra bananas now. When will blizzard realise you can't make the game so simple that each and every mentally challenged moron would have no problems with it. They dont need exatra rewards for their stupidity, i'd rather have them leave the group to free myself of their annoying presence. Wish all the other heroics would have an idiot check like that so i wont have to drag them on my coattail</div></div><hr />

<br />
People aren't &quot;bitching&quot; about the instance being hard or even overly long. People simply do not like the instance the way it was designed. I personally loved the place my first time in it but now I hate it because of the number of people that just don't understand the concept of vehicle combat.<br />
<br />
I will agree with the other posts here though, the loot change is very amusing, bribing players to run the instance won't completely entice players to do it, they will still hate the place and for the most part still refuse to run it.</div></div><hr />

They can make it as easy and fast as they like, they can make it drop 10 triumph emblems, I'm still not going to go there. I play this game for fun and I absolutely hate the mounted combat mechanics. It would be stupid is to do something you hate on your free time.</div></div><hr />

Most people with better looking raid mounts, who most likely only do it for the 2 frost badges, still won't do it either.<br />
<br />
That instance is frustrating beyond belief, not because of how it is designed, but because of how dumb other people are in this game. I know I'm not going to take any chances and assume everyone else realizes they go up and not forward.<br />

As for prot, You've got the wrong class Blizzard, it's Prot PALADINS that are retardedly OP in arena. Not Warriors. Ignore a prot warrior in arena and lawl at how rage starved he is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All this Oculus whine is funny, it takes like 15 mins the same as any other heroic and it's piss easy like every other heroic and the dragon part is piss easy like everything else in heroics so what's the problem? only instance I hate is Strat which I'm stuck with pretty much every god damn day when I do randoms. Does this mount have a ridiculous 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% droprate like the one in UP? farmed UP on god knows how many chars god knows how many times and seen the mount ONCE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For that matter, a free emblem of triumph for every 5 minutes sitting in the queue probably isn't far away either with this kind of attitude.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't worry if people QQ enough for this we will have it sooner rather than later, if you QQ for everything you get it, it's just a matter of when and not if. And I don't think tanks/healers need the rewards they get groups pretty much instantly it's the dps who wait 12 mins for a group that deserve the rewards, then again you could reward horde for spending 15 mins in a queue for a BG.</div></div><hr />

Badly implemented and BORING vehicle combat? Ditto with Ulduar and EoE - IMHO, it wouldn't be so bad if vehicular combat didn't feel so goddamn *clunky* in the first place, as well as being overused. Those annoyances aside though, Ocu in itself isn't that bad once you find your way around the mechanics and the encounters. If you're lucky enough to find a persistent group that will nuke their way around it, it's pretty well much 5 easy badges in 20 mins or so. I *do* wish people wouldn't just go &quot;FFS OCCULUS!&quot; and just quit the group though.<br />
<br />
Don't even mention Arthas' unstoppable yammering in CoS...he seriously needs a &quot;can we STFU already and just chase that sodding demon?!&quot; gossip option. It's a nice bit of flavour when you first do the instance, but REALLY grates when you're standing round scratching your balls after the umpteenth time waiting for him to stop flapping his lips.</div></div><hr />

<br />

You jinxed him, and his three's team dropped to #2 :o<br />
<br />
I'll agree that warrior prot is super duper fun in PvP, i'll even agree that in PvP it's OP. I've known this since beta when they added all the new bells and whistles to make it a &quot;pvp viable&quot; spec. The problem was hidden though, because it was only when warriors were in end game gear that the OP factor became a glaring issue, having BT/Sunwell gear i could stack well over 1300 block value and regularly kill squishys in one to two shield slams (especially with a crit). However, the number of Prot warriors like me were very few back in BC.<br />
<br />
Enter WotLootK, and the number of well geared Prot warriors has greatly increased. This in turn has caused more QQ about a spec that has honestly been OP since 3.0. It's just that there are more warriors with the gear that make it viable, and thus more visible. (An endgame BC T6 4 piece bonus as the starting WotLK T7 2 piece bonus did not help in this department.)<br />
<br />
If they want to nerf it because of misguided PvP aspirations on Blizz's part, i'm cool with that. It's just that they're gonna have a hell of a fun time re-balancing warrior tanks for PvE if any nerf occurs, which is why I'm pretty sure you won't see a prot nerf anytime soon. Especially this late into the expansion with Cataclysm on the horizon.</div></div><hr />

You may think it's easy because, well, you probably have half a brain or more. But unfortunately, the majority of the WoW community are uneducated retards that use leet speak and exist solely to make your life hell.<br />
<br />
Their lack of comprehension and understanding makes the mechanics of Oculus an almost insurmountable obstacle for them, and because of that, those of us with half a brain or more, get to suffer. <br />
<br />
So I quit out of every Oculus run because I don't need another moron agro'ing all the blue drakes, dying to laughably easy bosses, and generally, slowing down the run.<br />
<br />
Because of it's vertical design, you can't exactly carry people's hands through it and show them where to be. I've put raid markers up, i've tried written explanations, and they still fail to comprehend the idea of flying up.<br />
<br />
So rather then suffer through other people's ignorance, I abandon them to their own lack of intellectual capabilities and live a less stressful life because of it.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: I'm tired of waiting for other retards, Oculus is the worst offender for it.</div></div><hr />

So it's no wonder people don't like it. The rest of the heroics are pewpew DPS races. This one isn't. Granted, it becomes much easier once you've done it.. but most people don't want to take the time to even try when they can just get another pewpew DPS race in 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
I can't see the rewards making much difference. Yes it will be nice to get 2 emblems but my last PUG wiped 5 times, and not even 2 emblems are worth that amount of trouble and gold to repair. Perhaps if they dropped 2 frost I might be tempted to stick around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got a better question, if people hate Oculus why the fucking constant whine? if you hate it you hate it, move on and get over it yet they decide to QQ until Blizzard make Oculus too easy? when I hate something I don't whine about it, I hate CoS but I don't cry like some 8 year old spoilt brat when I get it all the time i suck it up, do it and gtfo when it's over, is it so hard?<br />
<br />
Heroics are just easy you can't even describe how easy it is, I've done Oculus and many heroics with the most retarded bunch of halfwits doing under 1k dps and having no fucking clue what left and right are but that's my point, you don't NEED anything else, this game was designed so even people deaf and dumb will be swimming in purple gear.<br />
<br />
I think it's simple, if you don't like Oculus don't queue for random heroics and stop wasting the time of people like me who have the balls to do something that doesn't just require 1 aoe button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play three different classes, with two off specs and a third on the way. When I join to do a random heroic it's because I want to play that toon, that specific platstyle. I don't want to be playing some gimmick pet that has 2/3 buttons to use. It's simply not fun at all for me, and I assume a lot of others.<br />
<br />
Vehicle gimmicks are fine the first time, maybe even the second and third times, but beyond that it's simply a grind that takes away from game play. It's why people didn't do Malygos after Ulduar came out (People still did Sarth).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroics are just easy you can't even describe how easy it is, I've done Oculus and many heroics with the most retarded bunch of halfwits doing under 1k dps and having no fucking clue what left and right are but that's my point, you don't NEED anything else, this game was designed so even people deaf and dumb will be swimming in purple gear.<br />
<br />
I think it's simple, if you don't like Oculus don't queue for random heroics and stop wasting the time of people like me who have the balls to do something that doesn't just require 1 aoe button.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really shouldn't reply to delusional fanboys who immediately assume that every post that isn't singing praises to Blizzard is a whine. It's called expressing your opinion. I don't like Oculus. Easy doesn't mean fun. <br />
<br />

Why try to lure/force them there? A better solution would have been to exclude 1-2 heroics you just don't like from the random list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then they would not give the extra emblems anymore for using the random option. You're not taking your chances on &quot;harder&quot; instances. So no need to be rewarded for completing anything the system would throw on you.<br />
<br />
Imagine a &quot;random character&quot; in games like Street Fighter, where you could say &quot;no, I don't want X,Y,Z characters&quot;... you would just remove the ones you don't know how to play and lol, what's the challenge on that?<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you give the option to remove, then what will happen to the &quot;few players&quot; that like doing it? They would probably not do it too anymore even without removing it from their list.<br />
<br />
For myself, I would remove HoL and Nexus (with a close 3rd place Gundrak). Tired of those. Long, boring, packed with trash mobs. Did them too many times alread and the system seems to like it way too much (like at least one of my 4 toons do it per day and sometimes all them do Nexus or HoL in a single day).<br />
<br />
Would like the system improved in a way that when you have way that many times the same random dungeon in your account, they go to some sort of cooldown for 1 or 2 days so we can get some fresh air, lol.<br />
<br />
Back to the oculus problem. Hope they don't give up on the style for Cataclysm and stop rewarding morons for their incapabilities. Last time I've played oculus, had a guy who never did it and we just explained it to him and he did the best he could. He enjoyed the diferent playstyle of the instance and was ready to do it again, now with better knowledge of it.<br />
<br />
Plain and Simple. Most players only know to move foward and Oculus require them to move not only forward, but to every other direction possible (360º and as someone already said, it's a vertical dungeon), wich means they won't aggro mobs comming only in front of them, but from everywhere and we don't have a tank that can instant pull aggro of the mob before the noob dies.<br />
<br />
Just look at those scrubs trying to fly and you'll notice that they don't have anykind of &quot;360º&quot; awareness. Usually 1st thing they do after mounting is to fly up high with plenty of mobs flying over him...<br />
<br />
That's why ppl don't complain that much of vehicle combat in Ulduar, they just move foward and 99.9% of the mobs are on the ground. The 0.01%, the little flying machines, you share the trouble with someone else (gunner), so you can just hide yourself inside the drive seat and keep following others foward. You'll only be pressed a little with some responsability if trying the 3 to 4 towers.<br />
<br />
and LOL at the sugestion of &quot;remove dragons&quot; from the dragon instance... what's next? &quot;Please, remove the undead mobs from ICC and it's perfect&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The good thing about so many people disliking Occ and leaving as soon as they get in is that when you finally get a group that stays, they are all pretty confident with the instance and the run goes quickly and well. <br />
<br />
The new loot table in Occulus is definitely going to increase the number of players willing to stay in Occulus if it come up as their random, but it is going to ruin my good Occulus runs. People who have no clue as to what to do are going to stay in hopes of getting the drake and and running Occulus is going to become a tedious, time-consuming wipe-fest once again.

Now since T7 content is old news and no one has to run it to progress anymore like Kara in TBC, people have forgotten how to use the drakes, the same is true of Malygos. I still shudder thinking of pugging the next time Maly is the weekly raid on my server. The drakes agroing around 2nd boss is another annoyance, I'll agree, as is having to mount, dismount, mount, dismount, mount, dismount until you wanna hurl. Its a clumsy unfun mechanic, I hate vehicle fights. I don't run SotA, even on the holiday weekends. I don't grab any vehicles during Wintergrasp (though I will destroy the opposing faction's and guard friendly ones) and Flame Leviathan was easily my most hated hard mode in Ulduar (yes worse than Mimiron.) I forget why Blizz introduced vehicles in the first place, I think it was to compete with another MMO that also had vehicles but I'm not sure which one. And do you know why people hate vehicle fights?<br />
<br />
Tell me, what sort of person pays $15 a month, grinds levels all the way up to 80, (possibly even on multiple toons) takes the time to choose a class, properly spec and gear their character to suit their specific play style, levels professions and grinds rep with factions only to not play that character that they had invested so much time into? I really don't understand why someone would go through all of the effort to create a unique personalized character only to be forced to play a lame, uninteresting, vehicle thats is the exact same as everyone else's. That doesn't sound like fun to me at all. For some it might be, and I understand that we don't have to agree with each other.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for me I am a tank and because of the 3.3 LFG system's never ending supply of mouth breathing DPS I rarely run without at least one other friend or guildy. (more often than not there are 3 of us.) This means that there are good odds that at least one of us will have party lead and the ability to queue for something short like AzN and be gaining shards and badges while we wait for the LFG CD to pass. I am also a druid &amp; a %280 mount has little appeal to me, flight form trumps all until they release more instant cast mounts. (wtb instant cast brooms) As a miner and a JC I already have tons of crappy blue quality gems I use for my alts or vendor if they aren't worth a piss.<br />
<br />
TLDR: There really isn't much of a reason to run Occulus, even after these changes. Vehical fights are terrible in WoW because they remove a player's investment of time and resources into a character and make them trivial. The new changes still leave little incentive for me to run it and that suits me just fine because it just isn't fun, and thats what matters most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, this may be how the developers wanted Oculus to be different, but the players end up disliking that main aspect of the instance because there is no true path that people are supposed to follow. Oculus, while not complex, is not a true linear dungeon. Yes, the overall objective is up, but there is no one true route like what Vanish02 said.<br />
<br />
This causes a few problems, as some are mentioned already: <br />
Everyone knows what they're doing, but goes their own way (some go for those on the platforms first while others fly off to the horseshoe), <br />
<br />
Aggroing unnecessary drakes along the way because of the lack of situational awareness (not their fault, as it needs getting used to know how to avoid aggroing those drakes)<br />
<br />
Needing to type out more than 1 sentence to guide those who don't know the instance [regular instances just need one liners to describe bosses (kill rifts, keep jumping, interrupt spell x, heal fully etc etc)]<br />
<br />
But there are a few groups of player demographics that we can all identify with.<br />
And we all do things at different speeds, both player-wise and gear-wise, hence when grouping up with the LFG, there will be one range of players who gets grouped with the slower bunch and ends up being not happy with them. <br />
From all the comments in the forums around the internet, the situation is already kinda bad for normal linear straight forward instances. Now multiply that with the tangled mess that is Oculus you get an instance that plenty of people are ready to hate and willing to shun.</div></div><hr />

Tell me this: Do you complain about this in all rpgs?<br />
How do you feel about periods of vehicle combat in Mass Effect for example? It goes from the rpg combat with your character to pure action.<br />
...or ship battles in Skies of Arcadia? You're not fighting with your characters there.<br />
...or the desert races and space dogfights in the Knights of the Old Republic games?<br />
...or AGWS combat in Xenosaga?<br />
...or dragon rail shooter segments in Drakengard?<br />
...etc.....<br />

Two easy things Blizzard could do to make the instance suck less in terms of fun (because it's already easy):<br />
<br />
1. Place the range baby drakes in the beginning closer together so they're tankable. I have yet to meet a tank who can actually enjoy tanking these damn things.<br />

that's not how balance works.<br />
<br />
We've said several times we want to get more if not all specs into PvP, and that includes Protection.<br />
I'm tired of your melee bias, when will demonology warlocks be as good as prot warriors ?<br />
<br />
As a prot warrior whose second spec has been a PVProt spec since 3.1 I can honestly say that having played a ret pally, prot warriors actually take skill and finesse to play well, all we have is utility, we don't bring much burst, we've got a decent number of stuns but everything except revenge proc stun shares DR, so again finesse as to how to use stuns, we have a few silences shield bash/pummel(shared CD) and heroic throw, and we've got a handy group spell reflect, and amazing mobility. <br />
<br />
All a prot warrior can do in an arena is harass the enemy team, and interfere with CC, but as a typical example of what must be done to accomplish this. <br />
Timing - to interrupt the appropriate cast we usually must change target and charge/intercept, heroic throw, intervene to a nearby teammate and shield bash, this in itself takes a lot of spacial awareness, for lack of a better word, you have to know who is casting what and where they are, and whether you can make it in time. Horic throw has a flight time, it's not an instant interrupt.<br />
<br />
To effectively spell reflect a crowd control effect you must compensate for latency(Fast reaction time), be in range of the person being targeted, or get there in time if the target is not you, understand a cast's length, and ensure no other spells are about to be in flight, Spell reflect only reflects one spell, unless they both fall within a .5~second interval. <br />
<br />
Revenge one of our strongest attacks, and our only stun(45% proc so not very reliable) not affected by diminishing returns, can only be activated by being attacked, and on a related note we become rage starved very quickly if noone is attacking us, so ignoring us hinders us greatly, we can intervene, and possibly activate ONE revenge every 30 seconds if noone is hitting us. <br />
<br />
Shockwave is very hard to line up correctly in PVP, latency can cause you to completely miss. You really have to be careful not to waste it, and it's even harder to get more than one person with it, as the effective range is shorter than the animation, and if you've charged a target the stun only lasts about 1.5 seconds after stun talents, and DR, so careful management of diminishing returns is necessary.<br />
<br />
Concussion Blow A very useful spell, a 5 second single target stun combined with some decent damage, if used after shockwave or even charging a target it's basically useless except as an interrupt, Prot PVP is all about managing diminishing returns, and protecting teammates effectively with intervene and spell reflect.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, to be effective we have to use more buttons than any other class Regularly used skills in arena:<br />
Charge <br />
Intercept <br />
Intervene<br />
Stance dance for Hamstring <br />
Shield slam<br />
Shield bash/Pummel<br />
Devastate<br />
Revenge<br />
Spell reflect<br />
Intimidating shout<br />
Heroic Throw<br />
Stance Dance for Shattering Throw<br />
Berserker Rage<br />
PVP Trinket<br />
Blood Rage<br />
Recklessness<br />
Retaliation<br />
Shockwave<br />
Concussion Blow<br />
Enraged Regeneration<br />
Shield Wall<br />
Last Stand<br />
Demoralizing Shout (Breaking rogues out of stealth)<br />
Thunderclap (slow down DPS on teammates) <br />
Heroic Strike (to burn excess rage and add a little more DPS to a burn down)<br />
Disarm (Reduce DPS or increase damage taken by an enemy by 10% for 10 seconds, nice on healers because they rarely have disarm reducing effects) <br />
Shield block (Very finesse at it is our only real ability to increase burst for a short period, usually used in conjunction with recklessness) <br />
A total of 27 abilities that almost all have to be bound. Good luck using that many binds and still being able to turn and move effectively as you press Ctrl = to intimidating shout.<br />
Compare that to a Ret paladins, what 9 abilities that have a use in PVP? Consecration, judgementx3 crusader strike, Divine Storm, Hand of Freedom, HoProtection, Bubble, repentance, HoJ I'm probably missing some, but you get the point.<br />
<br />
And more target swapping than the average by a large margin, including targeting our own teammates. <br />
<br />
Any prot warrior who does well in arenas, IS a good player. And DESERVES to be there. I guarantee that it takes many magnitudes more skill, and a far more intimate knowledge of class mechanics, and game mechanics to get to 2400 rating as a prot warrior than it does as a ret paladin, I mean seriously<br />

I love those groups. Spell reflect is so much fun, as long as you charge the correct mob (middle of pack so the whelps all start casting at once) you can spell reflect all of their first casts back at them for some nice starting threat, then it's just a matter of tabbing through with devastate and shield slam, you might lose one or two whelps to heal aggro or DPS, but overall it's not difficult.

people think that they hate oculus because it was to hard at first, atleast for some, so without trying it when its nerfed they just leave the grp.. the game realy becomes way to easy this way..<br />
people are scared or lazy or whatever, so reward them.. whats wrong in that picture..<br />

about the pvp prot war thing, blizz should never make pvp, or make different trees for it, they always keep screwing up PVE stuff because its to over powered in PVP.. who cares, it sucks anyway! imo ofc..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main problem is people seem to think prot warriors are overpowered. And it's very much a matter of a good prot warrior can do really well. A bad player can NOT faceroll this class. It's nearly impossible to do well. I'm worried that my class is going to be nerfed in both PVE AND PVP because we can do better than average 1v1, and CAN do well in arena if combined with skill.</div></div><hr />

You're giving them what amounts to a whole new set of mechanics and expect them to learn it all in a few minutes. This usually doesn't work well and even then, people don't learn the smarter way to play the characters.<br />
<br />
For example, I was in an Oculus run the other day on some alt and the group decided to do 1 red, 2 bronze and 2 green. I was one of the bronze drakes and I started rifting first. I waited a couple seconds after gaining 10 stacks to see if the other dragon would then rift before I fired, but he didn't. Then I told him in party chat to do that and that I'd wait for him before I fired, but he never did. That would've essentially allowed us to trade 10 stacks of Shock Charge, but he didn't :o. Oh well, we still killed Eregos.<br />
<br />
I don't mind these changes as I've never left an Oculus group until my entire group quit. One tip, if you think your group is going to quit, just stay in it, and if your party all leaves before you, your Dungeon Cooldown will go away.</div></div><hr />

I play three different classes, with two off specs and a third on the way. When I join to do a random heroic it's because I want to play that toon, that specific playstyle. I don't want to be playing some gimmick pet that has 2/3 buttons to use. It's simply not fun at all for me, and I assume a lot of others.<br />

As much as I dislike PvP, the same could be said about PvE. Certain people live to PvP. Certain PvE mechanics are overpowered/broken so blizz has to fix them and it can screw up a class in PvP. It's pretty hard to balance both evenly.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that WoW is a PVE game. PVP is just some addition (Blizzard already admitted that the introduction of Arenas was one of their biggest mistakes ever).<br />
PVP in WoW was is and never will be balanced. Winning in PVP will always depend on class, current overpowerness and whatnot more than anything else.<br />

Ever since the change to item scaling with the drakes it has been an easy heroic. The added nerf just made it easier. All in all its 4 emblems (now 8) for 20 minutes. If you don't do Occulus its because you are such a scrub that you shouldn't even be playing.</div></div><hr />

Once Ley-Guardian Eregos is defeated (e.g. your team does not hug the orbs in astral phase, fly to Kalimdor before realizing said phase is over, continually press the GPS button during the encounter, fly into Eregos before anyone is in position and face pull him, etc, ad infinitum) , in addition to the current rewards. Each loot bag will offer players rare gems (day old donuts), two additional Emblems of Triumph (day old bread), and a chance (.00000001) of being rewarded the Reins of the Blue Drake. These fine treasures (pieces of candy) could be yours should you (just get into our van we promise your Mom said it was OK) honor your fellow party members by besting the challenges contained within The Oculus! Keep in mind, however, that these extra (bags of unmarked 20s) loot bags will only be awarded to each party member if Oculus is selected by the Dungeon Finder when players choose the Random Heroic option.</div></div><hr />

I agree. I would have say VH is my least favorite, but CoS definitely comes close. In terms of heroics that need nerfed though, OK is now and always has been way above Occulus. Its the only heroic where you have a chance of wiping with a good group and bad RNG.</div></div><hr />

As of right now, I run my randoms on 4 different characters. The only thing I hope for is a quick run and 2 frosties. As soon that is done, I might run a few Frozen Halls instances, and then its time to get ready for raid.<br />

I agree, personally, I would like to see the tool lock you out for 24 hours if you chose to leave a heroic before the first wipe.</div></div><hr />

It's nice to have a change of pace with vehicle fights; sure you may not be playing the class you rolled, but it's a short diversion that breaks the monotony (which really helps when as an overgeared holydin you spam FoL incessently). As the vertical design? Eh, it has a learning curve, but it beats cutting teeth in ST. <br />
Sunken Temples' design drove me nuts for the longest time. With all the nooks and crannies, winding stairs, and two circular floors (the shrine and boss floors), this instance stole my sanity two expacs before Yogg-Saron. After you learn it though, it was pretty fun (playing with Erankius' soul is still a highpoint, hehe).<br />

In short, if you think WotLK has some badly design dungeons, just take a look at some infamous vanilla instances and realize how much worse it could be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, Blizzard had to go to the step of adding an additional loot bag to encourage players not to bail and run screaming to their guilds because the random dungeon came up as Occulus. I welcome the additional loot bags, with epic gems, additional Emblems of Triumph and the chance to get a new flying mount :) Hopefully, they will impliment Emblems of Frost as far as the award in the future.</div></div><hr />

4 times (the first one you should be able to get out of with a trinket and the second one you might be able to racial out of) is endless? Do you even pvp? There is this thing called diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grocalis</div><div class="date">2010-01-05, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When it comes to Oculus, I think a few minor changes would make the whole thing a bit more manageable, and less annoying.<br />
<br />
Mostly, they need to remove the use of the drakes from most of the instance. Not ALL of the instance, I think they should stick around for the final boss, but other then the final boss they are just used for drake cleanup, which if you are good, you avoid anyways, and if you are bad, just becomes annoying having to fly back to save someones rear from drake death.<br />
<br />
So here is my idea. Remember the little portal at the end of the first section? Put those all over the place. You enter the dungeon run through the first section, teleport to the prison, and fight the first boss. After he is dead, another portal appears, which takes you up to the lower inner-ring to kill the constructs. Once you loop around, you take another portal that teleports you to the first construct platform, then another one takes you to the second construct platform, before finally the next teleporting you to the second boss. You fight, win, and another one appears that, you guessed it, teleports you to the first Ulrom platform. So on and so forth until you actually fight Ulrom and then the final portal appears, which teleports you up to one of those tiny platforms (like the one with the loot chest) which now has the three NPCs that give you the drakes. You now get on the drakes and fight the last boss, loot, and leave.<br />
<br />
Really, it would not be that hard to make the instance more manageable, they just need to make the flow of combat better by removing the need to TRAVEL by drake, that is really what I think most people hate, the slow &quot;calling&quot; of the drake, the clunky combat when fighting the azure drakes, the slow ass dismount, etc... Just make the flow of the instance feel like other instances, and keep the drakes for the only boss that matters for them, the final one.<br />
<br />
Until they change that though, the extra loot will at least make me do it. I never hated the instance, I just find getting around on the drakes to be really cumbersome.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, what class can racial out of a stun after using a trinket? 4 stuns you say yet after a trinket there's 3 to go, and yes I PVP and you tell me every stun a warrior has is on DR? I must be blind then because I'm stunned for a ridiculous amount of time..and what if your trinket is used, you suffer 4 stuns and a fuckload of damage before you can even move an inch? while attacking them takes forever because of all the dodge, block, parry and very very minimal damage along with all the cd's to stay alive, and you still can't admit they are fucked up? haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then he leaves. Then you queue again, and the next guy leaves. It's irritating as fuck. Did a guild random run with three people (tank and two DPS), trying to PuG a healer and last DPS. I swear to fucking God we went through 6 people before we finally got a group together. We decided to wait until our timer was down to 7 minutes before we'd bail, it was at 8 when we finally got going. 7 minutes minutes of our time wasted because 4 douche bags didn't understand that random means random and sometimes you get shit you don't like as much. The last group we got an ele shammy who looked kind of panicked, and all but squeaked &quot;I've never finished this one&quot;. We said, &quot;you'll finish it this time.&quot;, and didn't give her time to leave before we started pulling. Finished the damned thing in about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you don't like Oculus, I get it. It's not my favorite instance either (actually I'd like it fine if people didn't leave me hanging all the time), but you know what? You did &quot;random heroics&quot;. It's random. You rolls the dice, you takes your chances. At the very outside it takes 25 minutes to complete (assuming you have drooling idiots in all four other spots). The timer is 15 minutes. No other instance is going to be completed in 10 (a few can be close, I'll grant you), so no matter how you look at it, finishing Oculus is faster badges than leaving. Just do it and move on with your life.</div></div><hr />

Yes, my Gods, this. Every 60 emblems on my main goes to 4 Crusader Orbs, Those go to my leather worker who combines them with maybe 200g worth of mats to make iLvl 245 bracers that sell for 2.5 to 3K on the auction house. if you don't have a toon with 245 patterns, the Orbs themselves sell for around 300 golds on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its the only fair way to go :) screw arena this game was made for pve, if not blizzard wouldn't spend so much time making instances/raids, making new tier gear, balancing encounters, and making difficult content (pre-wotlk of course although there have been a few encounters in Wotlk that have been challenging but not to the caliber that BC was).<br />
<br />
As for arena, Blizzard makes what 4-5 arena maps, lets u make teams, and just go in there and beat each other senseless and try and get a high team rating. It's the same thing over and over every season :P and before everyone is like oh you suck at arena you prob never played, i do in fact do arenas. I know for a fact that I'm not decent and doing arena's just makes me angry but I'm able to pull a 1500-1600 rating.<br />
<br />
And now with the cross realm looking for group, I for one would like to see a cross realm auction house implemented. I play on a mad small server and the economy is fucking terrible and am currently working on my insane title and finding materials to make darkmoon decks, pristine black diamonds, and the random libram is AWFUL.<br />
<br />
As far as oculus goes, with the right group it does go fast and you can just lolfaceroll through it. I for one on my main only do one heroic a day for my frost badges and I just get a premade from my guild and queue up for the random. On the off chance its occulus were like bleh but everyone knows what to do. On my alts on the other hand I refuse to touch oculus.<br />
<br />
-Where do I go<br />
-I've never been here before<br />
-What do these people do<br />
-I can get a drake? How do I summon it<br />
-head up to the horseshoe area to clear out the sentries only to find people flying off the map outwards<br />
<br />
are all key signals that these people are bad and you shouldn't waste your time in here because they don't even know how the instance works and you'll have to explain EVERY single detail too. And after telling them to fly up they fly around like a chicken with their head cut off aggroing every drake in the instance and as soon as they aggro every drake somehow magically find you and get everyone killed. This is why people hate oculus.<br />
<br />
As far as instances go, HoS with that dumb gaunlet event, HoL with the insane amount of trash to clear, and OLD KINGDOM are prob the worst instance ever. The only redeeming factor old kingdom has is that you can skip 3 out of the 5 bosses and do the vampire guy and head straight to the lass boss and still get your badges of frost for the random daily.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karr</div><div class="date">2010-01-05, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tell me, what sort of person pays $15 a month, grinds levels all the way up to 80, (possibly even on multiple toons) takes the time to choose a class, properly spec and gear their character to suit their specific play style, levels professions and grinds rep with factions only to not play that character that they had invested so much time into? I really don't understand why someone would go through all of the effort to create a unique personalized character only to be forced to play a lame, uninteresting, vehicle thats is the exact same as everyone else's. That doesn't sound like fun to me at all. For some it might be, and I understand that we don't have to agree with each other.<br />
<br />
This is a valid argument, but waters down after you apply the context of how many times you are really out of character. In raids I can only think of Eye of Eternity Phase 3, Flame Leviathan, Kil'Jaden P3-P5 and the upcoming Professor Putricide. And at that, the last two in the list don't require everyone to use the vehicles. Then for instances you have the first encounter of TOC5 and Oculus. To a lesser extent there are vehicles to drive in Mimiron's trash hall. <br />
<br />
Vehicle-based encounters are few and far between, they just add a bit of variety and require players to adapt to new playing environments. Vehicle mechanics in WoW seem on par with numerous other games* and do not appear clunky *(Battlefield, Enemy Territory Quake Wars, Tribes, Mass Effect, Half-Life, et cetera).<br />
<br />
Believe me, I have had my fair share of nightmare scenarios with other players in Oculus. But frankly Blizzard attempted to innovate and offered us a new perspective by giving us a non-linear vertical instance using drake combat. People seem too shy to either take the time to learn it (3 spells to read over) or are rushed by other veteran players through it (must have badges!). Hell, pre-nerf Lower Blackrock Spire was harder than Oculus pre-nerf was, and LBRS was linear and with no vehicle combat.<br />
<br />
There comes a point when accessibility diminishes certain hallmarks like risky innovation, unique quirks, and challenges within game play. Conversely, I can see how accessibility is vital to the popularity of gaming, and this game in general. Enough so that I don't mind the changes to Oculus because there are still ample challenges for all styles of gamers out there from casual, competitive, veterans, and social. There is a wide spectrum out there, I speak on behalf of whichever players I see eye-to-eye with and likewise you do.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I feel bad for you. The only real times I've ever wiped in a heroic random is in FoS because the healer decided to stand in the whirlwind vortex and try to heal on the first boss or in OK when the dps simply can't understand to kill the thing that takes 80% health in one hit. Every single time I've done Occulus its been 20 minutes or less from first boss, and I even got amber/emerald achievements in the same run with everyone using rubies and spamming 2 and 3.</div></div><hr />

Aside from the shortcut at the start, the place seemed pretty linear. Well, by WOTLK standards it wasn't a colorful hallway from A to B, but it wasn't a sandbox either.<br />

After reading through some post :<br />
<br />
1] noone was QQing about Occ, there were no posts maded or whine going on - only reason was insta leaving the instance and i bet Blizz do have numbers how many times ppl left instances and Occ is definitely a winner (followed by ICC heroics becouse of lack of gear for those instances)<br />
<br />
2] Occ is NOT hard. It has been nerfed so much i dont even know what bosses are doing cos we just burn them down in few secs like Loken in HoL - maybe you can remember the outcry about that boss ... If you ever been to EoE or done dailys around Occ you can even understand the dragon riding mechanics - problem is noone is doing that anymore ...<br />
<br />
3] both 1] and 2] and whole story here just leads me to ask myself a question : why dont i like Occ ? For me, its roller coaster experience with combat flow. Hyped for 30s, tottaly down for 30s mashing 1 button in dragon phase, 30s fight ... and so on, boss fights are cool and Malygos is piece of cake if you understand what is your drake doing which is not really well know cos you get your 3rd ability for the boss fight only ...</div></div><hr />

Revenge 45% chance on revenge hit to stun for 3 seconds not on DR<br />
Maximum amount of time we cant stun one player for, unless we get an absurd amount of revenge procs(Before 30% stun redux talents mind you):<br />
5Secs Conc Blow, can be dodged missed or parried If not you SHOULD trinket it, it's a 5 second stun.<br />
2Secs Shockwave 50% DR our stuns now suck ass.<br />
1.5 Secs from running out and charging if it's not on CD as only a maximum of 7 seconds has passed since we opened on you.<br />
Having fun? That's 8.5 seconds unless we get a revenge proc or you trinket. Technically we can intercept to add .7 seconds after shockwave, but you're not stunned long enough for us to run out and charge due to GCD, and then we have a 30 second, and 15 second cooldown on our gap closers so it's not worth it.<br />
Having fun? We stunned you for less than 6 seconds if you have one of the talents that reduces stun duration by 30%. The trick is that we have those stuns, and up to 6 seconds of spell lockout against casters, usually only 4.5 secs after DRs on silences though, and less if they have anti interrupt/silence talents.<br />
<br />
Really, our utility isn't that OP, because normally we don't have ArP gear to put as at ridiculous damage levels.<br />

<br />
Oddly enough you said you don't understand why vehicle combat exists and then said you understand in your last sentence. In an effort to understand another perspective, volia, here is mine.<br />
<br />
As for my argument watering down, please reread my op, I specifically mentioned the FL and Maly fights and listed a few more examples of vehicles in WoW. Just because many exist does not make them fun. I want to play WoW to have fun being a druid or a priest or something, not to be a tank with 2 spells. Yea, we get it. I didn't say Occ is hard, maybe hard to learn but not hard. If I wanted to just push 2 buttons I'd pick up a TV remote and be entertained (or play an arcane mage =P) I'm sure Hello Kitty Island Adventure isn't very hard but that doesn't make anyone a noob/scrub/whatever for not wanting to play it. <br />
<br />
I also understand that it was Blizz trying something new, again I heard they were copying a rival mmo that at the time had vehicles. Age of Conan or something, don't really care, maybe someone else can comment on other mmos for I cannot. As for those games you listed I've only played Half Life 2, I did enjoy it very much and I anticipate ep3 soon but I must admit the vehicle segments are probably my least favorite. A hovercraft with mildly responsive steering? A Dune buggy with a laser cannon that gets stuck on small rocks and can't handle a 35 degree incline with turbo boost? I'm not against vehicles as a whole, I'm against poorly executed game mechanics. I loved Halo for example, except for the Hornets in H3 but I'm afraid I'm getting off subject with different games. <br />
<br />
I get why they made vehicles in wow but all I'm saying is that they are poorly executed and not very thrilling. Like how the controls for a hulking siege engine, the reins of a dragon or whatever wacky vehicles they created (I'm looking at you Lebronski) all function identically. The Occulus also has horrible combat pacing. When you have to mount and dismount 10~ times in the space of 15-20 mins (on a smoothe run) you can't exactly call that intuitive game design. Kill four things, mount up kill a drake, land. kill four things, mount up, kill a drake, land. lather rinse repeat until 2nd boss, then repeat. Boss blinks away, kill four things, try not to agro stuff, land. Boss blinks away kill four things, try no to agro stuff, land. And again, then mount up again just to the one mob on the ring. It seems like a heavy dependence upon the drakes not even just for battle but just to get around to a rock you only spend 2-3 mins at tops.<br />

That may seem like fun for some people, but not me and apparently there are enough people who feel like I do that they nerfed occulus twice and are now increasing the rewards. After round 3 of Blizz enticing people to run this instance there are still people who will gladly take the 15mins of deserter to go do a profession daily or something else. Vehical fights have long been a running joke this expansion. There will not be another Occulus in cataclysm, you can bet your 2 extra triumph badges, obsolete quality gems and non-farmable %280 mount on that.<br />

No doubt the final battle in Icecrown against Arthas will be epic. <br />

i hear ya. yesterday i was farming heroics on my warrior. i got h cos. not once, not twice, but FIVE TIMES it was a span of around 4-5 hours. and i got that instance 5 times. blizz should just rename randoms heroics into random h cos IMO =*(</div></div><hr />

its the only fair way to go :) <br />
As for arena, Blizzard makes what 4-5 arena maps, lets u make teams, and just go in there and beat each other senseless and try and get a high team rating. It's the same thing over and over every season :P<br />
<br />
isn't pve &quot;NOT STAND IN FIRE/OOZE/NOVA WHAT SO EVER&quot; since... let me guess, vanilla?<br />
<br />
Only because one dev thinks implementing the arena system was a mistake doesn't mean ... get it? many people are happy with arenas. so please stop crying about pve nerfes because of balancing issues. in the end every customer should be happy, shouldn't he?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
LMAO You are blind.<br />
Charge no DR 1.5 sec stun.<br />
Conc Blow 30 sec CD 5sec Stun on DR<br />
Shockwave 20 sec CD 17 glyphed 4 Sec Stun on DR<br />
Intercept 30 Sec CD 3 Second Stun on DR<br />
Revenge 45% chance on revenge hit to stun for 3 seconds not on DR<br />
Maximum amount of time we cant stun one player for, unless we get an absurd amount of revenge procs(Before 30% stun redux talents mind you):<br />
5Secs Conc Blow, can be dodged missed or parried If not you SHOULD trinket it, it's a 5 second stun.<br />
2Secs Shockwave 50% DR our stuns now suck ass.<br />
1.5 Secs from running out and charging if it's not on CD as only a maximum of 7 seconds has passed since we opened on you.<br />
Having fun? That's 8.5 seconds unless we get a revenge proc or you trinket. Technically we can intercept to add .7 seconds after shockwave, but you're not stunned long enough for us to run out and charge due to GCD, and then we have a 30 second, and 15 second cooldown on our gap closers so it's not worth it.<br />
Having fun? We stunned you for less than 6 seconds if you have one of the talents that reduces stun duration by 30%. The trick is that we have those stuns, and up to 6 seconds of spell lockout against casters, usually only 4.5 secs after DRs on silences though, and less if they have anti interrupt/silence talents.<br />
<br />
Really, our utility isn't that OP, because normally we don't have ArP gear to put as at ridiculous damage levels.<br />
<br />
Edit: mistyped, shockwave is on DR<br />
i play priest at &quot;high rating&quot; (ololololo 2,35k in 5s &gt;:() and your cc rotation feels like an eternity. i mean it's not only that you can stun multiple times, BUT YOU CAN SILENCE TOO! THAT'S FUCKING ANNOYING BRO! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Challenge? Please. If I decide to tank on my paladin, the only instances I spend more than 15 minutes in are VH CoS and HoS, all because of scripted events, ICC 5 mans excluded.<br />
<br />
Someone also mentioned OK being hard due to RNG? I haven't had a run that's lasted longer than 10 minutes and that we haven't got the Quick Demise for. I've also personally cleared HoL with 19:48 remaining on BoSanc without a single death, you people clearly need better tanks. In before faceroll prot pallies, 10 minute heroic clears then you can talk to me.<br />
<br />
Everyone's arguments for and against Occ have been circular thus far, and Blizzard clearly has no intention of &quot;removing&quot; Occulus. It's the random dungeon, if people don't feel like playing it, man up. I've personally never left Occulus, but the instance is half cleared with 3 people by the time LFG finds 2 more.<br />
<br />
Occulus is a very linear dungeon, don't kid yourself. Kill the first boss to unlock the drakes. Use the drakes to go to 3 platforms in any order (WHOA SANDBOX!) to unlock the 2nd boss to unlock the 3rd boss to unlock the 4th boss. My God, the choices to make, no wonder people find this dungeon so intimidating!<br />
<br />
I believe all the PvP bad arguments have been retorted to, so that sums up most of the bad posts. God these forums are bad.<br />

<br />
People will have more resil. Also the only people that are this op are warriors in pve dps gear, as soon as people realize they tear like wet paper they will stop winning, prot warrs in battle stance in pve gear have no damage mitigation aside from plate and a shield, almost no avoidance, they only have block value, but they rarely block, they literally are glass cannons if a caster can get some spells off on them. so team up and rape the prot warr will be the new game. Also you can't faceroll as prot, shield slam and shockwave will only carry you so far. Yes there will probably be wannabe prots in the 1k-1500 bracket but only players that know how to use the mechanics effectively will do well.</div></div><hr />

My question to you is what about the rest of us who allot of time run with ppl who are just horrible at what they do with their own class, and I'm talking about ppl who do an amazing 800 dps at lvl 80 or when tank is doing 3 times more than that just because they like a certain spell(tanked vh 2 days ago on my pally tank alt and had a frost mage spammed blizzard the entire instance even during bosses just because he likes the animation). U should be grateful that at least in oculus Blizzard made sure that its less likely for you to under perform as you do most of the time. Also for people saying they are tired of telling people how to play in that dungeon you should think that maibe some are new to the place and if you explain the fight to them and they will most likely improve next time they come there if they are not brain damaged cause then it wont really matter where they go they will still be the same and u might just group with them and have them die every boss fight because they cba to move when nova explodes in pos or gd or when final boss in gd does ww and examples can continue. The only reason to hate oculus is because you are incompetent lazy and would prefer the game played itself and you would just messure ur epeen with the fat GS you got rather than the brains that should acompany that gear(pugs killing korolan and failing at emalon cause they dont know what nova or overcharge means). Maibe if you realise this game is about utility rather than doing as you wish wow standards would improve both in PvE and PvP(at least Bgs), meaning even if u are a dps you should be concerned about everyone not dying due to a mob beeing out of the tanks range casting a bad grp dmging spell or removing a curse if u got a pally(random class) healer and no other decurser in grp rather then I'm dps dont care about anything else just gonna go poke mobs with my stick and if things go wrong flame tank or idk healer for not healing me on my wild escapades.<br />
<br />
Ps : Sorry for the long sentences,i tend to write allot when I get upset, but the bad fame oculus received just because people are to brain damaged to crawl out of their narrow shells and realize just what a great instance Oculus is given it`s unique design that tends to brake the monotony of everyday things just because i cba to read what 3 buttons do and figure how to use them for the raids benefit rather than messuring their epeen with look at my dps or can anyone link dmg knowing that they did alot hoping they will get a praise.

<br />
<br />
Well i have to admit that you are right in every point. 2 extra triumph emblems? Nah don&amp;#180;t need any more of them, 2 Frost would be great. Blue dragon sounds nice, but i&amp;#180;m pretty sick of dragon mounts (have Albino Dragon, Red Dragon, Bronze Dragon, Twillight Dragon and Black Dragon) so that are too much dragons . <br />
<br />
Blue gems? Well i lol&amp;#180;d a bit. I mean for twinks it&amp;#180;s nice to get blue gems out of the bag, but for your main it&amp;#180;s just bad, cause nowadays epic gems are normal and you don&amp;#180;t even get gold for the gems in AH, maybe 5g each.<br />
<br />
Well OCC was never &quot;hard&quot; the only difficult part on this ini is the dragon shit, but they scale with your gear, so this shouldn't be a problem. And what&amp;#180;s so difficult on using 4 buttons of your drake? Well those guys probably still die at Heigan, or even on Kel cause of the void zones.<br />
<br />
Edit: And i only do the random dungeon for the 2 Frost emblems, so thats why i don&amp;#180;t need Triumphs anymore.</div></div><hr />

So don't play games, dude. I never liked p1 on Assassins Creed 2. But hell, I have to eat it. Every game has their shitty parts, Occulus was maybe one of those. You can't design a game wich 100% fullfil everyone desires, you just design it so you stress people and reward it when it accomplishes it. How hard is it to understand this is a game, not a movie you pay and relax watching eating popcorn.<br />

Ok first off you're telling me that its not ok for me to want to play my character and not only that but I should be feeling priviledged that I play something as compelling and challenging as a cookie cutter toon with 3 buttons? And as for helping other people, I give friendly advice here and there but I don't wanna train someone each and every time I run the palce. If I wanted to baby sit I'd have someone pay me instead of me paying someone $15 to babysit, no thanks. Also if anything the inclusion of making drakes scale with your gear score is actually REPELLING me from wanting to do this further because before that change was implimented I'd just do it naked to save the repair bill.<br />
<br />
Again no one is incompetent or lazy for not wanting to run this instance, we (the majority apparently) feel that it isn't fun. You can't tell me that WoW is about utility instead of doing as you wish. Why does anyone give a rat's ass about what some pixel wizzards and elves are doing? Because its fun, not because anyone feels obligated to come stop the pixel lich king bogie man. Because its a game and the only thing that makes a game worth playing is if it is fun. No other reason. I'm not sure why some people have trouble understanding that or maybe they've gotten caught up in srs busniz</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Two things I don't think you realize about WoW. <br />
<br />
First it is a MMO (massive multi-player game) means interacting with other people and trying to act as a grp rather than doing shit on your own.This is what it`s all about at lvl 80 grouping up in dungeons raids battlegrounds etc. If you just want to have fun go play mario which is also a game with &quot;pixels&quot; or idk go jump off a mountain edge or something and see yourself fly and get squashed. That should be pretty fun right why do you even bother to gear up if it's no fun fighting the &quot;lich king bogie man&quot; hell why do u even bother to do instances pretty confident farming some pathetic trash 15-20m can hardly be called fun. You should just stop playing the game all together because it is not fun. Omg blizz that mob actually killed me because I did not use my brain to shield myself from the long cast pls nerf it, it is not fun for me yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
Second I hope u realize that none pulled a manual up their ass that told them how to play this game well we all learned from trial and error or from people giving use advice on how to better use our abilities and shit. Before you tell me you are just to pro to need anyone's help let me tell you this: how many times have you read boss tactics looked at forums or stuff to better your game play or checked someones speck just to see what they are doing better than you? I believe the answer is allot of times because this is how the game works. People with better understanding of the game help others who are, let's say, less fortunate in that area. One obvious example is Boubouille. Do you think he does what he does just because it is fun to collect all the data and spend allot of your time just trying to see what will be of most aid to the wow community or because he tries to give something back to it.<br />
<br />
As a conclusion if you are to LAZY to even bother interacting with people than clearly wow is not the game for you. Go play poker or something where you don't really need to bother with doing different stuff than pressing a couple of buttons and just hoping for a lucky draw. Also can you people provide any other argument for hating oculus than just I don't like having 3 buttons to push because I wanna push the 4 buttons of my own class which you actually do most of the time even in Oculus. Also if you hate dismounting and remounting why bother doing that at all even outside Oculus why do u mount and dismount when you run from one quest to another or when go buy something that you need from the ah and go deposit it in your bank. Flying is 10 times better that's why Blizzard gave you flying mounts in the first place to help ease you travel time. Also the blue drakes are just like any other trash out there in any instance so what is the problem with having to kill a few to get to the boss as for fights bugging live with it, it is part of the game. Spent 2h wiping 2 days ago completing maligos must die not because people failed at drake fight even though some of them did but because we kept dismounting in p3 after a short while due to a bug. None went to trade chat and started nerd raging after the first &quot;wipe&quot; but rather pulled their act together and eventually managed to kill the boss. You see this is the difference between a real wow player and a mario player such as yourself who just cares to much about anything else other than the game play because he wants to hit stuff with his own stick rather than a different stick provided by blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xstar</div><div class="date">2010-01-06, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things I don't think you realize about WoW. <br />
<br />
First it is a MMO (massive multi-player game) means interacting with other people and trying to act as a grp rather than doing shit on your own.This is what it`s all about at lvl 80 grouping up in dungeons raids battlegrounds etc. If you just want to have fun go play mario which is also a game with &quot;pixels&quot; or idk go jump off a mountain edge or something and see yourself fly and get squashed. That should be pretty fun right why do you even bother to gear up if it's no fun fighting the &quot;lich king bogie man&quot; hell why do u even bother to do instances pretty confident farming some pathetic trash 15-20m can hardly be called fun. You should just stop playing the game all together because it is not fun. Omg blizz that mob actually killed me because I did not use my brain to shield myself from the long cast pls nerf it, it is not fun for me yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
Second I hope u realize that none pulled a manual up their ass that told them how to play this game well we all learned from trial and error or from people giving use advice on how to better use our abilities and shit. Before you tell me you are just to pro to need anyone's help let me tell you this: how many times have you read boss tactics looked at forums or stuff to better your game play or checked someones speck just to see what they are doing better than you? I believe the answer is allot of times because this is how the game works. People with better understanding of the game help others who are, let's say, less fortunate in that area. One obvious example is Boubouille. Do you think he does what he does just because it is fun to collect all the data and spend allot of your time just trying to see what will be of most aid to the wow community or because he tries to give something back to it.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
You're still missing my points entirely so let me break those down again. Why would you play a Role Playing Game if you can't be your own character? Wow is an mmorpg, not an action game. Vehicles suck in WoW, the majority of people think so or they wouldn't have had to change the instance... three times. I never said anything about being too pro to need help, your words, not mine. I just said that I don't think its my job to teach other people how to play. I'd start my own guild or write a leveling guide and sell to people if I wanted to do that. But I don't, I don't mind being social and interacting with people, as a matter of fact I do play poker irl and that does require other people to work. Your assumptions and stereotypes for people who hate occulus are inaccurate and the only one name calling or raging seems to be you. This isn't a flame war just because we disagree.<br />
<br />
Thats great that you wanna help teach new people everything that there ever was to know about this game, power to you. I do not feel obligated to, nor does that sound like my idea of fun. I want those 2 EoF's, and thats it. I understand that new people may not know how to do the instance, and there is nothing wrong with that, however, its is generally faster and more personally enjoyable if I do not have to train everyone. That doesn't make me or anyone else a bad player, lazy or anything else. It makes me effecient because I'm trying to get what I want with the least investment of time. The main flaw in your analysis is that you can choose your guild mates and who you raid with, with LFG you have no clue if someone is fresh from Ebay or if they've played since vanilla alphas. You know that people are capable of understanding and fufilling their duties.<br />
<br />
I for one am usually only interested in those 2 frost emblems at the end of it, don't care about anything else, I'm a JC, I have tons of crappy blue gems that I vendor for more than my server's AH sells them for. I'm a druid so I don't even use my rusted or any other flyer for that matter so mounting and dismounting for me doesn't require a lengthy (and bugged) animation, just a poof. I am also a tank so I can queue up instantly for something else even if 3 other people drop as soon as the occulus loads. There is no incentive for me to run it, even if its is my first random of the day, I'll still opt out of it or queue for a different instance because this content is 4 tiers below where I'm at progression wise and its a total waste of time for me to be doing anything other than smashing through it with the fewest possible delays. Progression raiding and pvp is fun to me, being a chaperone is not. I'm happy that you have the patience to spend two hours teaching people a fight that is about 16months old for obsolete gear. I do not posess that patience and I think there is nothing wrong with wanting to spend my time where it would be more relavant. To me Occulus is not one of those places.<br />
<br />
EDIT: just saw the hotfix. Thats four times they've tried to convince people that this place is worth doing. Some think it is, some think it isn't and no matter what they change I'm sure that there will always be people on both sides who's opinions will not be changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why should a warrior tank suffer because someone cant get around high meditation/resil/stam combo?<br />
<br />
Being a Prot warrior myself i would hate to watch my class/spec, I've played since BC get ruined, because of some PVP phase which has been stated by blizz as just being a phase.. now i know they aren't the brightest crayon in the box but they did say themselves that the spec has been around since wotlk. Now pple see it an issue because the gear has caught up, and can do decent amount of dmg. If you look at it from a raid point of view you need that amount of dmg output to keep up with the dps.<br />
<br />
back to the topic tho: nerfing a prot warrior's in pvp = nerfed prot warrior's in pve. <br />
<br />
They did this already to Druids, Death Knights and to some extent Paladins, and i think it has affected each class drastically (Rarely see a DK or Bear tank anymore). While i respect that each class has their own quirks and tweaks that need be done, a sense of balance is needed between all areas of the game and yes Tanking now days means giving a decent amount of dmg output to keep up with the dps<br />
<br />
If you want to stop worrying about protection warriors in arenas then lets try and get Fury fixed (titan grip nerf) for pvp. I bet a majority of the pple who do arena prot do it because of lack of options as a class. <br />
idk about you but bladestorm /win gets boring after a while =/</div></div><hr />

People will still leave instance regardless of nerfs and loot boosts. Many players don't like it and nothing will change that. I think Oculus is great, different dungeon, uncommon mechanics, multidimensional =), combination of normal and drakes combat. It was easily doable in 3.0, before drake-gear-boosts, nerfs (when 5x amber was something bit challenging). Anyway everytime I get there I don't mind people leaving it, only means good players will stay and we'll make it quicker.<br />
<br />
Not bad solution would be to set kinda cooldowns after players leaving. <br />
I don't know Finder's mechanics, but there is moment specific players from queue and dungeon is chosen. Would be good if person who left e.g. oculus before would not be able to get there for next 2-3 tries/hours/days (could also put them in end of queue). Before Finder was implemented players not intereseted in it were simply not going there - make them leave and not allow to come back for longer time for both - ours (ppl who stayed) and their (leavers) good.<br />
This would kinda work as well for tanks farming Hilts in HoR (someone wrote about it earlier). They leave it's harder to get there back for them.<br />
<br />
Shamans<br />
I just can't stand reading shammies moaning about BL drums, shittness of their class, raid invitations ending for them, etc. Few examples:<br />
<br />
Wrath of Air totem is only (not replacable) 5% spell haste buff :O<br />
Improved Earth Strength Totem is ultimate/best Agi/Str combination buff giving 178 of both (instead of 155 Horn of Winter) - you max professions to get 40 mor str and 23 agi/str for each raid member is nothing?<br />
Drums: Look at the kings/motw drums - they not as good as origin ones. Drum Kings do 8% instead of 10%, so BL drums will prolly last 30secs or and give 30% of haste, or both! <br />
It will be just good addition to some 5/10 setups which can't get the shammy.<br />
Restos are imba raid healers, Ancestral Healing giving fulltime 10% damage reduction oO<br />
<br />
Plus many others like 280sp no matter what, 5%crit for spell, etc.<br />
Any good player will get invite to raid in sense guild. Dps is not everything, and even if gearing up (to make dps more than enough for top content) is easier than ever. Go Oculus for extra badges.<br />
<br />
Nerfing ICC<br />
No comment. Just thinking either Blizzard is stupidly blind or this is intended to make Wow1.0 die slowly.<br />

I think we ran into the same guy. Did he have a tenacity pet and Hellfire Peninsula quest rewards? He thanked everyone at the end of the run for their patience but all I heard was, &quot;Thanks for doing the work for me.&quot; I think that if you can keep fresh 80s out of H HoR then you should keep ones wearing gear thats 18 levels old out of there too. WTB more attunements like BC plz</div></div><hr />

I understand that people want smooth runs, but this attitude rears its ugly head all over the place and it's piss poor at best. Those of us with higher end gear will end up carrying people, it's just the way it is. Just deal with it. Maybe some day that 700 DPS hunter will end up being the 11k DPS leader for your guild? We all have to start somewhere, and those of us who dinged a few days after LK launched were in that same goddamn gear. So pipe down and pop a few Doans pills to relieve that back pain, and keep carryin' people. It's what we're always going to end up doing.</div></div><hr />

Oculus is like the easiest heroic to do now, and one of the fastest YET they still b*tch about it &gt;.&lt; <br />
<br />
Wow you have to use flying a bit and hit a coupe buttons that your drake has, that's a damn complicated job for some people i guess.. Jeez, even a monkey could have done that for a banana bunch. But looks like we are up to that point, and have extra bananas now. When will blizzard realise you can't make the game so simple that each and every mentally challenged moron would have no problems with it. They dont need exatra rewards for their stupidity, i'd rather have them leave the group to free myself of their annoying presence. Wish all the other heroics would have an idiot check like that so i wont have to drag them on my coattail<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have to call people idiots or morons or compare their intelligence to a monkey - have the intelligence yourself to look at it from others perspectives. Just because someone leaves doesn't mean they are retarded. Maybe they play WoW because they want to have fun. Maybe it's not that it's hard, or boring really. I guess there's a fine line between boring and 'not fun'. But, not fun is what I'd call Oculus. I didn't choose the class I chose, or decide to play the character I decided to play today because I didn't want to play it, or wanted to play something else. <br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, though, I don't leave the instance when I get it as my random. It's just terribly not fun for the next 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I actually think that mechanic, however annoying it is - and it can be - actually makes sense, unlike the most of the mounting mechanics.<br />
<br />
Giving ground and flying mounts a similar (yet polished) mechanic would be quite cool, rather than the &quot;poof&quot; mounting animation...<br />
<br />
We got all kinds of quests with awesome mounting animations, Argent Tournament mounted combat being the most popular atm, and still have the silly standard mounting animations on personal mounts... honestly.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, trivializing everything in the game certainly isn't the way to go... going from realistic to &quot;convenient&quot; isn't the way to go either. It's &quot;convenient&quot; at first, soon it becomes pointless, kind of how mounts currently are more of a speed boost than a cool feature.</div></div><hr />
