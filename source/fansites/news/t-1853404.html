Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Saw your recent discussion about developer communication. Was interesting. Sucks how awful people can be. Stay strong.<br />
Players don't hurt my feelings. I am old and crusty. But other devs may be too scared or scarred to participate. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634121997388087296))<br />
<br />
Shame that people fire back and say &quot;Well, the devs need thicker skin!&quot;.... -.-<br />
Would be nice if they did, but they don't, so it comes down to: do you want to talk to them or not? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634173009121558532))<br />
<br />
But if there's a policy against talking to players, they clearly don't think it's worthwhile.<br />
Developers might value it while the institution does not. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634121540808785921))<br />
<br />
I'm just not fond of every company lately treating every single little thing like they're the nuclear launch codes<br />
You mean keeping things too close to the chest? I agree. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634476998681755649))<br />
If you promise and have to pivot, people are going to be disappointed. Just deal with it. Still better than never talking. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634477195994402818))<br />
<br />
What do you think has prompted WoW players to come to you seeking answers about Blizzard as of recent?<br />
I have a big mouth and poor impulse control. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/634121624883585024))<br />

Good thing they're turning more items into toys, but they still need to be better about it. I think they should either drop their stance about not making things that give a useful buff a toy or make a new window called &quot;useful items&quot; or something for things like Aviana's Feather and the Skull of the Mad Chief. There's getting to be too many of these items now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I admit, I am one of those who does not play much - but am subbed - I play WoW in small sessions - maybe 3-5 hours total in a week. And I struggled to get the quests done sometimes. For someone who would play 4-5 hours in a day or about 15 hours a week, the weekend bonus time was more than enough. So I can only conclude that players are devoting less and less time to WoW these days.<br />
<br />
Thesy should just make it a weekly bonus instead of a weekend bonus and include tuesday as well..<br />
<br />
Also Patch 2.3 in Diablo 3 coming in so there will be even lesser players in WoW.</div></div><hr />

Its oversaturation of events. Timed events are cool when they are rare, but when they become too often it stops being cool and rare and people stop participating. Then there is an issue of apexis event that is a joke event.<br />

Yeah Apexxis event is pointless if the quests dont give increased apexxis.. Players were farming apexxis areas only to grief opposing faction players..<br />

&quot;Just carrot on a stick to get players play longer.&quot; What do you think the entirety of WoW and every other MMO is? You must be at that stage where you first start noticing the nature of MMOs and little things seem like time extenders. Don't worry, you'll eventually see that every task is a carrot on a stick and either go with it and have fun, or quit MMOs all together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup. What he said. I play WoW only because I find something fun. And I play it at my own pace without anyone else dictating to me on how I should play. If I find some aspect of the game fun, I play that. Fortunately, I find SO many things fun in WoW that I feel like I will never run out of things to do since I kind of like everything WoW has to offer.</div></div><hr />

If flying doesn't release on Sept. 1st the internet is gonna explode again just like Ion Fuzzykola's announcement that it will never be coming back.

What the hell was going on in Irvine that this little stuff did'nt make the release, or at least 6.1? It's all screwy, this amount of sheer stuff in this patch justifies it as 6.3, this &quot;minor&quot; patch is what 6.1 should have been. <br />
<br />
Again - it's great they're adding it all - but why so late?</div></div><hr />

Would love to see them do more of this in the future with hidden caves, rares, pets, treasures and Easter eggs, in addition to adding more flying mobs so that the skies feel more &quot;alive&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Probably to give us more stuff to do doing the drought, but it's odd because like you said this expansion is pretty much over with.</div></div><hr />

Indeed!<br />
<br />
Instead of just keeping us grounded in fish bowl-style zones where there's nothing of interest above ground level, they should be making areas that are ONLY reachable by flight, mobs that patrol the skies, rares that you have to chase down in the air (Aeonaxx for example) and all that jazz. Make the ground leveling experience different from what you see in the zone when you can fly. And add dangers to the skies, if they want to prohibit people from just dropping in and then out again from quest objectives they can make that sort of gameplay dangerous. They managed just fine in 5.1 for example.</div></div><hr />

This is actually one of the reason I've enjoyed reading GC's stuff even after he left WoW. He calls shit like he sees it, even about himself.</div></div><hr />

There will be a bump for flying, no doubt - but how long will it last? Flying only effects Dreanor - players who left because of flying could have stayed for the rest of the old content...but didn't. <br />
<br />
Plus, we're heading into fall, and all the holiday events - that will bump up numbers some, as people work on the meta and do all the events. Plus they have the ring grind still going, so I think they'll stabilize at least through December.<br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />

Did they thought that there was not enough players unlocking flying after all? Like not enough players were doing their pve content? Just carrot on a stick to get players play longer.<br />
<br />
The most likely answer is that it is indicative of the fact that Blizzard was right all along and most people haven't even been working on their flying achievement because flying isn't a huge deal to the majority of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Also the &quot;carrot on a stick&quot; is how MMOs work and is how they will always work. It is the cornerstone of the MMO genre.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How on earth do you reach a conclusion like that? Given all the tweets we've had over the few months there's never been a hint of needing an axe to grind, or are you somehow attributing the tweets to GC as being his?<br />
<br />
Reading comprehension much?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hm? All his tweets imply that he loved and respected the dev team very much. Every time people are trying to piss on Blizzard, he comes to their defense.</div></div><hr />

It would have been nice to have it earlier, but it's not surprising. I don't know why, but they have never revamped holidays to include the current expansion in the first year of said expansion. It's always been in the second year where the current expansion is finally included. And since this is the first expansion that is not going to be 2 years long, it seems really late.</div></div><hr />
