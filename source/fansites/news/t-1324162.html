Don't worry if anything they would put jet boosters on it for it to fly it wouldn't make much sense for it to just be to be ground mount I mean really they would be breaking the 100% tradition thing lol</div></div><hr />

The reason being is that enh will choose it for a dps gain by putting searing and magma down at the same time. Elemental could also potentially do this, but would have to go into melee range once every minute. Even if you don't do this you can still keep searing up at the same time as fire elemental.<br />
<br />
Yes, its not a big dps gain, but a blatant one like this will encourage lots of people to take it.<br />
<br />
Why couldn't they just have 20% increased totem range or something.</div></div><hr />

But hey it's not blizzard that will be selling coins for gold it will be players......because that's oh so much better and obviously isn't gold buying in their eyes.....obviously.<br />
<br />
Why add a currency at all when they have this thing called battlenet balance that people could use for the exact same thing if blizz took away the restrictions of what you can buy with it? Currency for the store just screams gw2 gems and them allowing coins to be bought for real money and then letting players sell them for gold or buy them from others for gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After a lot of heavy discussion, we've decided not to go ahead with the Mana Tea nerfs for now. As many of you have pointed out (and we’re keenly aware), solving the issues with Mistweavers’ mana regen is not a small task, and while we’re not happy with how things are working currently, it’s just a bigger problem than we’re comfortable trying to solve in 5.4. We’ll be revisiting the issue in the future.<br />
<br />
Note: There is a possibility that the next PTR build will have a number of other changes that we were considering, but have since decided not to go ahead with. Should that happen, they will be reverted in the build after next.<br />
As it looks like several of the changes I mentioned as being reverted are starting to pop up on datamining sites, here's a list of what we've already reverted internally:<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Tea will remain at 4% mana restored per stack<br />
Expel Harm, Soothing Mist, and Crackling Jade Lightning mana cost nerfs will be reverted<br />
Renewing Mist will continue to generate Chi.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, those are changes that we've already decided not to go through with, but the current PTR build was put together before that decision was made. As some have already pointed out, making those changes would require large changes elsewhere, which in turn would likely cause even more changes to be necessary, and so on. It's a bit too much to try to squeeze in for 5.4.<br />
<br />
Also note that, while we are going to make changes related to Mistweaver mana gameplay in the future, they may not be these specific changes. It's something that's still under heavy discussion.</div></div><hr />

Well, research shows that human perception works different when it needs to deal with artificial currency (ie. a person is going to spend more). There was a very interesting article about it at gamasutra a while ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, the Blizzard coin system will (as the name implies) be used as a cross game coin. HS already will work with coins, so you win matches in HS, get coins and these coins areused to buy things on the Blizzard Store.<br />
<br />
So the argument of &quot;buy to win&quot; is already redundant as one can say it you play you already earn coins by itself.<br />
<br />
Of course you will nedd to play 72 hours per day to earn enough coins, but it IS possible.</div></div><hr />

Why waste time, effort, money, &amp; resources changing shit, that pretty much doesn't need to be changed 3 or 4 different times. Then waste the same shit again, changing it back, but a lil different. And people wonder why shit doesn't get fixed, just changed until it's another problem somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

Some of these changes drastically change the playstyle of classes in addition they should be reserved for a new expansion. What the fuck are they thinking?<br />
