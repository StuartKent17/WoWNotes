<br />
Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br />
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at interviews with Ion Hazzikostas from Eurogamer (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-02-25-blizzard-explains-USD60-cost-of-world-of-warcraft-level-90-character-boost) and Brian Holinka from PlayersCut (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwrsZl8b0I).<br />
<br />
Eurogamer<br />
<br />
The Level 90 boost is being sold to allow players that would have purchased multiple copies of WoW to get more Level 90 characters to do so in a more reasonable way.<br />
The price point was decided upon to avoid devaluing the accomplishment of leveling a character to 90.<br />
If Blizzard's goal was to sell as many boosts as possible, they would have set the price lower. <br />
The price point wasn't selected to maximize profit, just to represent the amount of time that it takes to level to 90. <br />
<br />
<br />
PlayersCut<br />
<br />
The team has already started planning for the next two expansions. <br />
Removing arena teams was an important part of increasing participation in arenas. <br />
There is a lot of Garrison content that comes from having followers. <br />
Patch 6.0 isn't the end of new content for Garrisons, as more content can be added as the expansion progresses. <br />
The devs know that some kind of Garrison PvP sounds really cool, but there aren't any solid plans yet.<br />
Ashran has a lot of players taking part in the battle, but they are spread out so that performance doesn't suffer. Ashran has a fortress for each faction, as well as capture points spread around the outside of the zone that are beneficial to hold. There will likely be a larger central battle with other battles going on around the outer part of the zone. <br />
There aren't any plans for mobile content for WoW right now.<br />
The technology for character model animation was finally at a point where models could updated for this expansion. Character models had also started to look outdated compared to some of the newer art assets in the game. The Pandaren were the test for new character models, and using lessons learned from them the team can update all of the other races. <br />
There are so many older armor models that it isn't possible to go back and update them all. The team can use them as inspiration for new armor sets though. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Season 15 Begins<br />
Season 15 gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-green-text=22) uses the same models as Season 14 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/373-Season-14-Armor-Sets), but with different colors available to each faction. <br />
With weapons at the ready and armor secured, it’s time to kick off PvP Season 15! The playing field is even once more, and this is your chance to prove that true grit and steely determination are what it takes to become a champion. So grab your most trusted companions and teach your enemies the true definition of fear!<br />
<br />
Before you set foot in an Arena or on a Battleground, keep in mind we’ve made a few changes this season:<br />
<br />
<br />
Conquest gear is now Item Level 550<br />
The Dampening debuff will be applied in 2v2 matches 5 minutes after the start of an Arena match, and games will reach a draw at 20 minutes. Dampening decreases the effectiveness of healing spells by 1% every 10 seconds.<br />
Base Resilience is now 77% (up from 72%).<br />
Battle Fatigue is now 65% (up from 55%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck, champions—may the most bloodthirsty warriors win!<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 14 Titles<br />
These titles and achievements were indeed given out erroneously, and we're in the process of applying some fixes that will remove them from characters below level 90.<br />
<br />
One additional clarification, since we've seen this question come up elsewhere: These titles went out completely separately from the ladder, and thus did not affect the number of titles given to max-level players in any way. No one is missing titles due to this error.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
I'd like to point out Life Tap, which changes to a passive and maintains its bar position for destruction. I like that.<br />
Seems like there has been much confusion about this tweet. It refers to how 3 active talents share 1 button without macros. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430540639214632960))<br />
What if it's a tier where one of the talents is passive? It will be an empty slot then?<br />
Then we likely would not make the other two share a button like that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430545239992856576))<br />
Couldn't talents be adjusted so that they can be made into one skill slot. Tiger's Lust is the only ability 1/2<br />
No, we don't want to constrict our design space to 'only new buttons' or 'no new buttons' for a row. Mixtures are great sometimes (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430621433471844352))<br />
So stuff like the warrior tier with Bladestorm etc<br />
Yes; we could make Shockwave, Dragon Roar, and Bladestorm all share a button, so you don't have to swap after retalenting. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430541469946875905))<br />
Would it be Macro-able? Like &quot;/cast Tier3Talent&quot; or something?<br />
Something like that. Mages already can do /cast Mage Bomb. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430545402907983872))<br />
<br />
Cool or Uncool: Instead of separate spells, procs like Pyro/MC change upgrade Fireball/Shadowbolt. #ButtonBloatProbz<br />
We think we could do a lot more spell replacement. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430503382294360064))<br />
<br />
Personally, maintaining %dmg buffs is not interesting gameplay. There's a reason ISF got cut from Destro.<br />
It depends on *how* you maintain it. If it just happens, it's just rampup. If your rotation molds around it, it can be cool/fun. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430401603552550912))<br />
could we rebalance lavalash to not require flame imbue? it doesnt feel like weapon imbues are optional at all<br />
Weapon imbues are not intended to be optional. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429510979034963968))<br />
Not saying imbues should necces be passive, but if they are active they need to provide meaningful gameplay.<br />
When you get to the point of complaining about the maintenance upkeep of a 1hr buff, that persists through death... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430188917183115265))<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts on passive immunities like dematerialize &amp; subterfuge, Holinka? Are they staying for WoD?<br />
Not committed to either staying. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/429730227187482624))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Will the new char. models change Tauren male dual weilding's graphic to stop the left hand weapon from slanting to the left?<br />
Yes; the latest in-progress version has the weapon turned around completely and clipping into your crotch. (I'd hope so.) (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/429020851380305920))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Why is there a need for catch up loot? Why are we encouraged to skip old tiers of content in every expac?<br />
Many reasons. A big one is so that the playerbase is centralized; easier for guild recruiting, playing with friends, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429510711769694208))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
passive != fun! is math not fun? is altering your fantasy incarnation via the universal language useful? <br />
We're not making stats more/less passive. Math is fun. I don't understand what your issue is. I suspect a misunderstanding. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430541121203081216))<br />
excuse my bad jokes. just that balancing stats, building different gear sets for different situations, etc, was a lot of fun. -&gt;<br />
And still will be. We're not getting rid of that, at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430545531715076096))<br />
<br />
Obv, I'm talking about Active Mitigation scaling. If Multistrike provides only dps/threat, it will be a garbage stat for tanks.<br />
All secondary stats will be of defensive value for tanks. Some may be passive mitigation, some may be active mitigation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/428802643125735424))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Can you please clarify the requirements for Hero of the Horde/Alliance? <br />
let's say there's 1000 ppl above 1000, then top 5 get hero. If #5 doesn't have 50 games, then #6 gets hero. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431499036961419264))<br />
<br />
Have you guys considered random starting locations and horde v horde, af v af in random bgs? (maybe not all)<br />
many players find the faction swap in RBGs quite jarring. Not something we want to expand on. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430945600473808896))<br />
<br />
I dont think you ever commented on what you think the prob is in AV/IOC. Thoughts?<br />
IoC I blame mostly on a bug in 5.3 where Alliance could leave gates early and win most games. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430949211698233344))<br />
This damaged the hivemind view of Horde win chance in the bg and so sophisticated horde avoid it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430949426337574913))<br />
AV has map problems, but Horde also avoid it, making the situation even worse. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430949947676958720))<br />
Some might think map design is only problem but even on mirrored maps, one faction fares better. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430950658078822400))<br />
Much obliged; very relieved to hear the AV map is suspect. I've said this for awhile. Thanks!<br />
Woah, easy there. I said it has problems, but I'm not sure they are HUGE problems. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431083893454680064))<br />
Not to be rude but if you know AV has problems, why has nothing been done in 8+ years?<br />
AV has gone through a lot of change in 8 years (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431081583747928065))<br />
<br />
Final win to loss ratio 4 ally in ioc: 100 wins, 2 losses. How do devs look at those stats and call them fair-balanced? <br />
We've been pretty clear on saying there's a problem but it's more complicated to fix than some players think. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/429474923849846784))<br />

Illidan (http://www.heroesnexus.com/heroes/10-illidan) is just one of the WoW characters that appear in Heroes of the Storm! (He also comes with a normal skin that we looked at recently (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/illidan.jpg))<br />

<br />
The problem was that they were offering the 90 boost as part a WoD expansion purchase and if they hadn't made it available this way, then people would have just bought multiple copies of WoD instead and then transferred the free 90's to their main account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because levelling sucks and it takes forever and I never want to do it again after 5 ults and I want all classes so eventually I will buy the 90s</div></div><hr />

<br />
The good thing is that if you don't see the need to buy a 90 then you don't have to buy a 90. <br />
<br />
But, as for me, .. if I had the cash to blow I might do so. Why? Because I already have fully leveled up two level 90 Alliance Rogues on different realms. I raid on both regularly (along with other alts). But I have friends on another realm (and on Horde) that I want to raid with. Now, keep in mind that I already know how to play a Rogue. I'm QUITE good if I do say so myself. But leveling up a third Rogue to level 100? Incredibly boring and tedious. This would help me get another toon that I could raid with my friends on while letting me not have to suffer through the exact same leveling I have already done before.</div></div><hr />

Then they should only make the 90 boost available to people that own all the expansions including WoD and which the account already holds a level 90</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elemynt</div><div class="date">2014-02-26, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't matter how they try to color it. Still devalues the game. For any player with even one max level character, leveling another is pathetically easy and fast already with BOA equipment. They will see a number of people buying into this nonsense and find they can make even more profit. To me they are heavily crossing the &quot;Pay to Win&quot; line with this and it will only get worse as they continue to add more &quot;Conveniences&quot;. Some of you actually like this. Or argue about not having enough time to play(Even though that is largely your own problem). This stuff kills games. It's a down hill slope once pay to win enters the fray. I love wow and have been playing it since early classic. To see Blizzard going down this road is depressing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. I already have 11 90's on one server. The only thing I'd get out of it is gear-upgrade to 489 as the last char to get to 90 was a couple of weeks ago and only have greens and blues atm.</div></div><hr />

The whole point in starting at level 90 is so you can jump right into action with friends and/or experience the new content. Gating in the way you say would go totally against the point.</div></div><hr />

BULLSHIT! If they didn't want this to be a thing, they could simply not give any boost at all, and keep the game a bit more respectful. Level boost is one of the worst P2W that exists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you understand how much time consuming 1-100 will be?<br />
Stop with the P2W bullshit, it's just a very expensive shortcut for someone who got money and not enough time, being max level doesn't wins you anything if you are incapable of end gaming PvP or PvE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you gain an advantage of what...a few days? 2 or 3? you still start at 90 like the vast majority of present players. Leveling to 90 is fast and insignificant anyway.<br />
<br />
What advantage will you gain in those 2-3 days? Total content completion and gearing up takes months (unless you're a top heroic guild, in which case they're in a league of their own and are a minor section of the population ontop of that and are in no way relatable to the mass wow public. They're all gonna take whatever advantage they can at whatever investment needed to do so, so all things will be equal amongst them anyway) The limit on drops (due to RNG), badge tokens (or wod equivalent) earning limits by week and max amount, bonus roll limits by week and max amount and the other various limits on progress that stretch it into weeks and months means that an advantage of 2-3 days in a sea of players who are already at your level...<br />
<br />
...is completely insiginificant and within 1 week at minimum, 2 at best so everyone else has caught up with you and you have made no significant progress to speak of over anyone else already within the initial progress run by everyone at the start of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

This is another &quot;stupid&quot; argument that most f2p games use(now sub games too). What about people who got the money plus lot of free time?

<br />
What about them? Those who come back will get the level 90 boost. Those that will regain their account and chose to play that account instead they will also get a level 90 (since they will buy the expansion). They will just not be able to transfer the level 90 of the first account to the other account. What you don't understand? People will get one 90 to their account they will chose to play, they will just be unable to transfer a second one from another account. What people they will screw up? People with multiply accounts that suddenly decide they want to play just one account with all their 90s? Seriously? They can still transfer the characters they normally played, they just cannot transfer the 1 character who took the boost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really?Why they don't make boost costs 10 dollars then?<br />

<br />
This is just a marketing decision. If the boost was 10 dollar then no one would level a char, the world would be empty and then maybe lose lot of subs from people who like leveling chars or new players. I am not in their marketing team to know why they chose that price, but sure they did that for the overall money they can get from their game.</div></div><hr />

IMO: The boost will do good and hopefully lower people from being angry/drama when leveling, since there's a way to skip that. I hope low-leveling will be better with this feature :)</div></div><hr />

The $60 price point was decided upon to avoid devaluing the accomplishment of leveling a character to 90.<br />
If Blizzard's goal was to sell as many boosts as possible, they would have set the price lower.<br />
The $60 price point wasn't selected to maximize profit, just to represent the amount of time that it takes to level to 90. <br />

I call bullshit. They're saying that the time it takes to level to 90 is worth more than an entire xpac. Not a chance in hell. If I looked at the amount of time I spent leveling my druid from 1 to 90 after taking a break from WoW and coming back around 5.2, and the time I spent playing after I hit 90 so far in MoP, the difference would be ridiculous. Time spent leveling (at worst 5-6 days of actual playtime), with heirlooms, xp elixirs, hell friends running you through dungeons, is a drop in the bucket, and in my oh so humble opinion, worth maybe $10, compared to what buying an expansion buys you: multiple raids, months of content, and any other time consumer you can think of. I don't know who they're trying to kid by saying it isn't for the profit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is so retarded or insulting about this? It's a perfectly good argument. The thing thay want to avoid is not a ton of people transfering characters. They want to avoid having people buying multiple accounts to get the boost. Restricting the transfer service for boosted characters wouldn't really solve anything as there is no doubt in my mind that the people who would buy a new account and expansions to get the boost would just play their new 90s on the separate accounts instead. The only difference between that and offering the boost in the store would be that these people woudn't have to switch accounts all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Convert to Raid's latest episode touches exactly on a great point for this, for a lot of people and somewhat mentally, $100 is a cut off point, it's &quot;too much&quot; for the general person, so, buying 2x90's would go over this cut off point, but if they had put the price at say, $30, it's immensely more likely that people would use it multiple times, they would buy 3x90's and still be under the mental barrier of $100, and Blizzard would of made $90 instead of $60.<br />
<br />
It really is no where close to being maximised for pure profit, it will make them a nice little profit, but it's not tailored for mass consumption by the general gamer.<br />
<br />
Will I buy one? I don't know, depends if they screw the UK and EU over with it being £60 vs $60 and crap like that, I also enjoy levelling, and would rather be cheap and RaF or something, but that's me, if another guy wants to buy an account full of 90's, go for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why there are plenty of &quot;arcade&quot; games. Ppl forgot wich kind of game WoW is exactly... it's not an outdated mechanic from another era because WoW mmorpgs didn't evolve to arcade/fps games. They're distinct types of game.<br />
<br />
Giving the excuse that &quot;it's for those who can't play&quot; is stupid. With this argument, there is no reason at all to not sell gear for example. I don't have time to play, just give me an expensive shortcut to grab the top gear so I can dive right into the faceroll in pve/pvp for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Actually, why someone who pays a sub and go trought the &quot;tedious and outdated mechanic from another era&quot; dings 90 without a decent ilvl while someone who pays go right to 480+? It doesn't matter that you have timeless tokens (but not for 2 trinkets and weapons) if you're getting your 1st 90. Even if you alread have one 90 that isn't roflstomped by the mobs at the isle, not necessarily you do have the correct token to use.<br />
<br />
In a sense, it's actually a small P2W since you're making the other guy go trough all the leveling + the gearing to even get the 480+ ilvl that someone who payed for the boost got. The insta 90 guy (if you consider him a new player) doesn't know how to play at all, why put him right into ToT LFR and harder places like isle instead of doing normal scenarios, dungeons, heroics, old (and now easier) maps... the boost should give the questing ilvl you would have after dinging 90 at dread wastes.<br />

Guess it's hard because it's part of this kind of game genre.<br />
<br />
One can understand someone who alread have a few 90s not wanting to level AGAIN. But it's kinda hard to understand why a arcade player would want all the other genres of game to become arcade games and not accepting that others don't understand it.<br />
<br />
And they actually screwed the boost service when they decided that the character would also skip part of the post-90 stuff, giving 480+ gear instead of the usual ilvl you finish the leveling. You're actually paying for some advantage over someone who just &quot;pays the sub&quot; and level it to 90 and will have to do dungeons, craft gear, get stomped in timeless isle looking for tokens (but not weapons and a 2nd trinket), etc.<br />
<br />
If it's just for the &quot;noble goal of joining your friends&quot; at 90, they can't help you trough this small &quot;tedious and outdated mechanic of gearing at max level&quot; instead of screwing those who do not/can't pay for the character/gear boost. Everyone would love to finish leveling to 90 (without the character/gear boost) and receive a nice set of 480+ gear in my mail (weapon included) so I could skip dungeons, farming for the correct tokens, etc.<br />
<br />
And yes, altough it doesn't look like, since boosting players will have to go trough 10 levels after WoD, this advantage will increase a little since you'll get there with better gear than someone who is leveling the normal way (if they don't do things right, you could even be locked out of LFG until reaching the minimum ilvl for the leveling dungeons, be it trough questing rewards or wasting gold with adventure gear from vendors a few quest hubs later into the map). Not to mention that they'll probably upgrade the service to 100 + higher lvl gear after sometime into WoD...</div></div><hr />

I don't think you understand &quot;pure capitalism&quot; at all. Blizzard sells the item at what they feel is the right price. Maximizing profit off a single item is not always the best business decision if they feel it will negatively impact other profit centers (as in, Blizzard actually likes it when people level up because it requires more playing time which equals more subs). <br />
<br />
Plus the idea that they'd sell 600% more boosts at $10 v. $60 is just something you pulled out of your butt, you might be right, but I'm sure they've thought a bit more about their pricing structure than you have.</div></div><hr />

Now personally I don't want to get involved in the &quot;paid 90s are st00pid&quot; debate or even the &quot;$60 is stupid overpriced&quot; debate...but I don't think anyone would argue that Blizz's reasoning for the pricing is flimsy at best.</div></div><hr />

You can't compare it to how much the monthly sub costs, that has absolutely nothing to do with the price point. They are valuing the 48+ hours spent leveling from 1-90 at $60 because, believe me, just as many people would complain if they priced it lower. If you haven't leveled a 6th or 7th alt to 90 yet then I suggest you try, because it is gruellllling.

I don't think this is P2W b/c lvling is the easy part of the game and with heirlooms it's even easyer. Now if they sell gear that's P2W, being lvling 90 with no gear really means your not wanted from raids or anything. I lvled every class befor heirlooms well all but the monk and it was easy.

Then maybe that's something they need to change much more than just offering heirlooms, because leveling from level 1 to fucking 100 at this point is just stupid. But at least you can spend $60 to skip it.

They are valuing the 48+ hours spent leveling from 1-90 at $60 because, believe me, just as many people would complain if they priced it lower. If you haven't leveled a 6th or 7th alt to 90 yet then I suggest you try, because it is gruellllling. Sure it's &quot;easy&quot;, but if they valued that amount of time investment at $10 or $15 just as many people that went to the effort of leveling 1-90 manually would be insulted by the low price.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would have to say if the price was like $10-$15 or even like $40 it would be very insulting. I lvled 11 90s ''every class'' yes it's too easy but the time to do it if your not 24h it sucks. I think $60 is ok I understand why it's that but like $80 or even $100 would have been ok with me.</div></div><hr />

the only thing you are winning is time. P2W is more like buying epic gear or any high end gear to be able to beat others easier and faster...<br />
<br />
Hearthstone is more P2W because you are able to buy card packs that will give you a chance for better cards which allows you to win faster and become greater easier.<br />

<br />
Buying a lvl 90 just allows ppl that don't have all day to play, a chance to experience endgame raids or whatever faster.<br />

I think it's a bit sad in the sense that players could technically just buy all of their alts now, rather than take advantage of the free 90 and level the rest. Still, this should provide a very lucrative opportunity for people making gold, cause lets face it, mats for proffessions are gonna rocket with people wanting to level them on these new 90s.<br />
<br />
Plus, its services like this which are keeping the subscription at like, £8.99 a month, so if introducing this outrageously priced service means the sub stays the same price, as it always has, then I will reluctantly comply. Its not like it affects me anyway as I wont use the service, but it just seems like such a huuuuuuge waste of money to throw at Blizzard when they already make mega £££ as it is, perhaps its time to invest in some shares in Blizzard? xD Show me how! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well how many kid's play and how many will be able to just buy the $60 lvl90? Not that many, with heirlooms its way easy and with out it's still not all that bad, if you want to spend the money do it or lvl the real way. I lvled every class up that's 11 90s. They have done xp gains and im sure at some point they will do more time will tell. The ideal of giving a new player a free 90 is good get's them into the game and they will make them stay.<br />

Yes P2W is buying Gear in WoW, the ideal of being able for other's to get to endgame faster is ok with me. WoW buying or free 90 is NOT P2W it's all about endgame and high end raid gear.</div></div><hr />

2 days of /played, which means a week playing each evening... So, it's not even worth 10$....<br />
<br />
Ever heard of opportunity costs? That's what the $60 are about and not subscription costs or expansion price. <br />
I.e. &quot;How much money am I willing to pay to avoid doing 48 hours of something I hate&quot;. Obviously, everyone values those 48 hours differently and Blizzard thought that 60 bucks is a sensible price. Some think it's too high, others think it's too low. You can't please everyone.</div></div><hr />

The $60 price point wasn't selected to maximize profit, just to represent the amount of time that it takes to level to 90.<br />
<br />
Gonna go ahead and call this total BS. If they wanted to limit the amount of boosts, they could have easily said something like, you get a maximum of 2; 1 for if you preorder WoD, and one more to buy; or two if you choose to purchase them both. Blizzard is about the money--they are a company. And I'm fine with that. But saying they didn't do it to maximize profits is absurd, otherwise what is the point of adding the feature to begin with, if not for additional revenue?</div></div><hr />

I agree the price for the level 90 character is on point and fairs out with the whole gaming community where games pop out for 60 dollars. So if you want that new shaman for example for a whole new experience in the game... 60 dollars is a good price for it all instead of buying a game, your buying a whole new character to experience the game with. Now will it only be just the 60? or for example if I had a level 80, will they have a reduce price? lol</div></div><hr />

I buy a month of access for $14.99. Within this month of game time I can do what I like and if I decide to roll an alt, I'll ding 90 within that month of game time. It takes a couple of days /played to ding 90 running dungeons with heirloom gear.<br />

It's pretty blatant what's going on here. They want to milk this feature as much as possible and maximise their income as a result.

A player with a lot of time in his hands can probably do this in less than a week. If you play a few hours a day you can problably hit 90 in a month. A month is $14.99 (where I live it's $7.50).<br />

When will people abandon this hopeless way of thinking? Paying for a level 90 character isn't pay to win and will not impact in the game negatively or positively.<br />
<br />
If you think that there will be a lot of players with a level 90 character that doesn't know how to play it, well, you don't need the boost to see that. It's happening right now. Plus Blizzard stated that if it's your first level 90, they'll give you a few skills in the start and work your way up from there.<br />
<br />
And don't forget, you still have 90 to 100 to master your character.<br />

$60 is essentially an xpac + transfer to your account which is $25. if the xpac is $39, then the boost is slightly cheaper than that approach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As my esteemed friend above said, the RAF has been around for years where people have bought extra accounts for themselves to take advantage. So has 3rd party levelling services. Why is this any different? Just because Blizzard is offering an easier way, a way that doesn't risk your account or is more complicated than it should be?<br />
<br />
<br />
or design decisions that put profit before game play<br />
<br />
If they wanted profit, they'd have made it a price that was easier for the average person to pay. This price ensures that the majority actually has to make a concious choice about whether it is worth to skip levelling for 60 bucks.<br />
<br />
<br />

Hmm, so twice you posted that the level 90 had no impact on him, then you came up with a whole bunch of impacts. So which is it? And yet, you won't answer a simple question that has been asked of you directly at least twice, what advantage does someone gain from boosting to 90? Also, considering every customer will get one for free, doesn't that completely discard your &quot;outside wealth&quot; argument?<br />
<br />
If you can't express how something negatively effects you, then I'm not sure why anyone should bother listening to you if you complain. It's not like anyone's asking for a complex argument, just &quot;this negatively effects me by X, and this is how it does so&quot;.<br />
<br />
So if you want to say &quot;it trivializes old content&quot;, that's fine, but explain how it does, but also explain how RAF or Heirlooms didn't do the same thing. If your or he can't do that, then you really just complaining for the sake of complaining.</div></div><hr />

So has 3rd party levelling services. Why is this any different? Just because Blizzard is offering an easier way, a way that doesn't risk your account or is more complicated than it should be?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If they wanted profit, they'd have made it a price that was easier for the average person to pay. This price ensures that the majority actually has to make a concious choice about whether it is worth to skip levelling for 60 bucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How so?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still have to receive an answer as to how exactly buying a character 10 levels below the cap gives an advantage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm asking you as you're the one making the decision to leave. I keep seeing how this or that is bad for the game, but when asked directly people rarely seem to give a thorough answer.<br />
<br />
Allowing people to skip 90 levels completely is trivializing the content completely - it may as well not be there. <br />
If the feature was put in for game play reasons it would be free. This is purely a profit making issue.<br />
I fail to see how any one cant see how allowing people with money to skip content isn't a two tier system.<br />
Leveling is always an advantage and this has the added advantage of time. If there was no advantage how on earth would you sell it?<br />
As I said ask Blizzard about the potential dangers to the game. You yourself have said &quot;If they wanted profit, they'd have made it a price that was easier for the average person to pay&quot;. Have you not asked your self why that is or are you too busy only seeing the facts you want to see while busily contradicting yourself.<br />
<br />
BTW 3rd party leveling services will get you banned.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2014-02-27, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually, pricing it at $60 does make sense profit-wise. they wouldnt make as much if people just bought xpacs to boost characters.<br />
<br />
$60 is essentially an xpac + transfer to your account which is $25. if the xpac is $39, then the boost is slightly cheaper than that approach.<br />
<br />
Exactly, so many people are crying over this without realizing that selling level boosts was never their intention.<br />
<br />
1. A lot of returning players and new players are put off about having such a long time after their purchase until they can play with their friends<br />
<br />
2. Blizzard realizes that having a boost to 90 for free with an expac will drastically increase sales to returning players and new players.<br />
<br />
3. Blizzard realizes that it will now be possible for current players to buy an extra ex-pac, boost a character to 90, then do an account transfer to get that character on their main account<br />
<br />
4. Blizzard decides it is just easier for them to implement a cash-shop boost for the same amount of money as #3. Blizzard actually saves money because if a player does #3, it requires a human being employee to do the character transfer, but the character boosts they implemented for #2 is fully automated.<br />
<br />
The purpose of all this was to get returning players and new players to not feel intimidated about the ´100 levels´ ... #4 was just a secondary thing.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
At launch they said that this game would ever sell anything with real money. Then they said that they will sell server transfers as a favour to us (instead of giving them free), but would never sell anything in-game related. Then they said that the mounts and whatnot are only cosmetic, and that they would never sell anything that has impact on the game. Now they are saying that they will never sell anything that has impact on max level, like gear, but I think everyone can see where we are headed in a couple of years with this trend.<br />
<br />
And all the pricing choices are to maximize profit from the game as a whole. So when they are playing the semantics game and telling you that they choose the price not to maximize the profit (from that one particular services), they are taking you as a fool. Don't be one.<br />
<br />
Quote please where the devs or anyone at Blizzard said they would ´never´ sell cash-shop items<br />

Honestly, I have no idea why people would quit over a lvl 90 character with crap gear... Have you not heard of RAF? The Guardian Cub? If you were going to rage quit about something, you should be long gone with those two. Those two things completely gut your ´slippery slope´ theory because they are WORSE than the 90-boost... <br />

Stop with the P2W bullshit, it's just a very expensive shortcut for someone who got money and not enough time, being max level doesn't wins you anything if you are incapable of end gaming PvP or PvE.<br />
Yes, I know how much time 1-100 will take: exactly the same, or even less than what it takes to level 1-90 right now. <br />
It's unreasonable to expect otherwise.<br />
<br />
And that time is even lower than the time it took to level 1-60, 1-70, 1-80 or even 1-85, when Vanilla wow and those expansions were relevant. <br />
The time it takes to reach max level is continuously decreasing due to nerfs to XP/level required and to the addition of Heirlooms. The number 100 is meaningless, even for a newcomer.</div></div><hr />

That is just not true. You hear it all the time on MMO forums and I am sure Blizzard has extensive marketing that says that a ton of people do NOT return because they feel so far behind. In reality, you are correct, the time it takes to level to 100 is probably less than it took me to level to 60 the first time.. but there is a psychological component to it too. The bigger the number gets, the longer it seems to get there.<br />
<br />
DDO has a lvl cap of 28, that sounds a whole lot more inviting then saying 100</div></div><hr />

Give me a link to all the old forums and I will. And in my opinion, even though if there was an option for a 'wow' without cash shop I would take it, I dont think any of the implementations have been damaging to the game directly, but combined with developers having to eat their words time after time, they do reveal a nasty trend that will lead to a game that I don't want to play anymore, so I'm talking against it while there is still time to avoid it. <br />
<br />
Also while the crappiness of the current community and in-game mentality is a result of many small things, cash shop is one of them.</div></div><hr />

It's not P2W, but skipping leveling is against the spirit of MMORPGs, even if it is an archaic spirit. But that is just my opinion of course. :p</div></div><hr />

These people have no intention of boosting characters and if they do, it will be at most one or two missing 90's. The people who would actually see a tangible benefit from the boosts are for the large part saying that the price is way too high.<br />
<br />
If we take Blizzard at their word that the $60 price is to &quot;devaluing the accomplishment of leveling&quot; then I would say that they have made a terrible mistake by listening to all of the doomsayers. They did it with Cata and they are doing it again now. The game is only special enough for heavily invested people to pay $60 for a boost. i.e. The existing customers. The free boost might pick up a few renewals but the majority of people considering returning to the game will not fork out an extra $60 just to skip some boring content. They will rather just toss the game to one side.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no, zip, zero accomplishment in leveling to 90. If a bot can do it then it's pretty meaningless. It takes no skill. It's boring and just takes time.<br />
<br />
All I can say is &quot;Well done guys, you have gotten your wish. WOW is now even more exclusively yours&quot;.<br />
<br />
Personally, I do think they priced it there to maximize profits. Why else did they cancel RAF? To encourage people to buy the boosts instead of using RAF for a boost.</div></div><hr />

I do not deny the time advantage. That is the reason why people are willing to pay in the first place. However I don't see other advantages. The only other advantage there might be is learning to play your character. That has luckily already been addressed in that pre-levelled characters will go through a DK-like starting zone where abilities are unlocked over time to allow players to learn their character. And the new Proving Grounds requirement for certain dungeons will certainly weed out the worst there is. I see no other issues that a lack of levelling would provide. Especially not when you consider that you'll be receiving a character at 10 levels below the max.<br />

Also if two guys start at the same time, and one buys level boost, he will have huge advantage in world pvp due to using leveling time to get max level gear, when the other guy finally reaches max level. World pvp that could be about resources in a world where you can not fly, and those resources could get you max profession and earn you a spot in a raiding guild, while the non-boosted player gets left behind. It's highly theoretical, but you can't say that it doesn't have any potential to effect the game.<br />
<br />
Some ask why drop RAF for this, well to go from &quot;this game will not sell anything with real money&quot; to &quot;p2w&quot; you need to take baby steps and this is one of those steps to conditionalize people to accept that in-game shops are normal and needed. Streamlining, especially is very slippery sloap argument. Afterall, you could always streamline people selling fully geared characters in ebay or whereever to the in-game shop.</div></div><hr />

So now you admit there is an advantage one which is only available to those with wealth. It is clear that Blizzard see that allowing too many people to use the feature would be bad for the game (something you cant seem to see) and so they limit its use by imposing a high fee. They could have done this via other ways but instead they chose to make money out of it. They are effectively making money out of poor content with no replay value. <br />
<br />
What they have done is made a 2 tier system making less well off players get level 90 characters in &quot;a less reasonable way&quot;. In other words the wealthy get a better in game experience which I feel is unacceptable in a P2P game. <br />
<br />
Interestingly, if you exploit your way to level 90 you would be banned, but the effect on the game is exactly the same as someone purchasing a boost via the shop. Why would you be banned?, for exactly the same reasons that allowing the skipping of content is a bad idea.<br />

<br />
Well, I guess we can argue about what your definition of &quot;wealth&quot; is. First off, everyone gets one free boost, so that eliminates that. Secondly, is $60 too much for a game that has a $15 a month charge, a $40-60 price for the expansion that requires broadband internet that runs at least $50 a month? Saying this particular $60 fee is suddenly an advantage is being a bit to cute. I'm not saying $60 is nothing, but the costs to play WoW (PC + Internet + Subscription + Expansion) is much greater than $60. And how come this subject never comes up about server transfers or buying a second account to RAF?<br />
<br />
But ignoring the money, it still doesn't answer the question, if you are a player today and have a 90, where is the advantage that people are getting with &quot;wealth&quot;? WoD is probably four to six months away, there is plenty of time for a current subscriber to get any number of characters to 90 prior to the release of the expansion. <br />
<br />
Personally, I will never pay for a boost, so I get you there. But it really seems like you're taking this to the extreme to try and find problems that don't really exist, or if they do you are greatly magnifying them to make them seem much worse than they really are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personal opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
with no replay value.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, then none of the game can be said to have any replay value. Why would you kill a boss again after the first time? The gear just makes you kill it faster next time, it won't be a new experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
What they have done is made a 2 tier system making less well off players get level 90 characters in &quot;a less reasonable way&quot;. In other words the wealthy get a better in game experience which I feel is unacceptable in a P2P game.<br />
<br />
Again, personal opinion. If the level boost was easier to get, I'd take it like I've said before. Not because I dislike questing (I actually like it), but because it would get me to the endgame faster which, to be quite honest, is where most of the gameplay is located in the game currently.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interestingly, if you exploit your way to level 90 you would be banned, but the effect on the game is exactly the same as someone purchasing a boost via the shop. Why would you be banned?, for exactly the same reasons that allowing the skipping of content is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Using the game in an unintended way can usually have some side-effects that are not always readily visible to an outside observer. And for reasons stated above, Blizzard clearly does not like the thought of making anyone able to skip to 90 as they please. But for other reasons they have also explained, they have wanted a catch-up method for a while. And that is why the expansion carries a free boost with it. And as they said just yesterday, people would surely buy more expansions in other to boost more characters. Blizzard likes to simplify things, if you believe what people are saying. Why should this be any different?<br />
<br />
<br />

If they were of that mindset, they'd start selling gear. If Joe buys a level boost to 90, Mark is no worse off than he would have been otherwise. Both still have to level 90-100 by themselves. They just arrive at the same destination a bit apart (and Joe has 60 bucks less to spend on RL stuff).<br />
<br />
If however Mark bought the Conquest PvP weapon if that were available to buy for cash, then Joe would be at a rather severe disadvantage in the game. There's a rather large difference between a purely convenience-based advantage, and a player power-based one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A long cool down could have limited it or reduce it to 1 per account. <br />
<br />
You would have a hard time getting people to pay money to skip a fun and rewarding part of the game - its a personal opinion but its shared by alot of others. What are Blizzard saying about the quality of the content by allowing people to skip it.<br />
<br />
Better in game experience a personal opinion? - you cant sell a lesser game experience for $60 (Do you think about what your saying before you post?).<br />
<br />
Don't hide behind side effects not readily visible. They don't ban leveling through exploits to protect from bugs they do it to protect the integrity of the game and its leveling process. Something that $60 makes them forget it seems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Allowing people to trivialize content is never a good design but if they do it it must be available to all. If that means it will make a mockery of the leveling process how does that justify it being there at all? The attempt to simplify things if anything encourages people to skip it.<br />
<br />
Your logic is twisted by your Blizzard supplied blinkers. You cannot claim that is now a level playing field. Those that can afford will skip content utterly undermining people leveling alts who cant afford it. In other words the wealthy have a better in game experience - In what universe is that a level paying field?<br />
