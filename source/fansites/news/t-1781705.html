Blizzard Q1 2015 Earnings Call - Developer Interview<br />
Ion Hazzikostas talked to GamesBeat (http://venturebeat.com/2015/05/14/dear-world-of-warcraft-players-heres-why-you-should-stay-love-blizzard/view-all/) about the recently announced loss of 2.9 million subscribers, Patch 6.2, and Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Subscriber Numbers<br />
<br />
The team was excited to see the number of subscribers increase with Warlords release, confirming they had selected the right idea and setting for the expansion.<br />
Their goal is to make a fun and engaging experience and not chase subscriber numbers, as they are confident that the numbers will follow in the wake of that. <br />
WoW released at the right time and has been a very adaptable game, which has helped to sustain it over the years. Other MMOs provide inspiration on how to make the game better.<br />
The loss in subscribers is partially due to the cyclical nature of the game. <br />
Players don't play WoW year-round anymore, they just come back for new content and then go off to play other games. To some extent that is okay. The team doesn't want to prevent people from playing that way. <br />
There was a large spike in subscribers for Warlords so they knew there was going to be a &quot;bit of a dip&quot; after that.<br />
The WoW Token hasn't had a drastic impact on the number of subscribers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
The new dungeons in Warlords were great, but there was no incentive to keep running them after the start of the expansion. <br />
Previous expansions had something like Valor Points to keep players coming back for more dungeons. <br />
It felt silly to run the same content over and over even as your character got stronger, which is why the dungeon rewards were removed, but they went too far in Warlords.<br />
Group dungeons are one of the greatest strengths in the MMO genre and it is a shame that there hasn't been more of a reason to do them recently. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Content and Patch 6.2<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 is one of the largest content patches ever released.<br />
Patch 6.2 adds Timewalking and Mythic dungeons, making group dungeon content relevant again.<br />
Patch 6.2 iterates on existing systems, polishes things, and adds some new content. <br />
Massive class overhauls aren't as likely to appear in content patches anymore, as returning players come back to find that their class has changed once again.<br />
The amount of content added in a patch is a balance between satisfying the hardcore players that go though content very quickly and the players that go at a slower pace. <br />
The team also has to make progress on future projects that are important while still working on upcoming content patches. <br />
Certain types of changes are reserved for expansions rather than patches to keep complexity in check.<br />
<br />
<br />
Accessibility<br />
<br />
Accessibility is a core value of the game and has helped WoW grow and sustain itself.<br />
Classes are more complex now than they used to be back in the day. Destro Warlocks in Burning Crusade raids would literally keep up one debuff and press Shadowbolt really hard and fast to beat everyone else. The game hasn't been &quot;dumbed down&quot; from that.<br />
Changes have been made to trim excess and keep things focused, but there is still a very high skill cap. <br />
Both more casual raiders (Normal difficulty) and hardcore raiders (Mythic difficulty) can now see the entire story. This wasn't possible in older expansions like the Burning Crusade. <br />
Accessibility means allowing players that have been playing for a long time to continue to enjoy the game, even if it is at a different level of commitment as their life changes. Many players started out as students and are now professionals with families.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids<br />
<br />
More people are doing organized raiding than ever before thanks to some of the conveniences that have been added recently.<br />
It would be nice if Mythic could scale with the raid size, but the team isn't sure that level of tuning is possible. <br />
Making specific mechanics and encounters for Mythic difficulty is possible now because of the fixed raid size, but if the raid had to scale down to 10 players that would no longer be possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Social<br />
<br />
The social aspect of the game is very important to the overall experience. <br />
The convenience features added over the years have made the game slightly less social.<br />
Sitting in town for an hour trying to find a tank in trade chat to go and do a dungeon was inconvenient, but it allowed you to make stronger social bonds. <br />
The Group Finder is an attempt to try and create environments where you can still meet new people without spending an extremely long time forming groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The group finder is getting lots of use for PvE and PvP content.<br />
Garrisons give players reason to log in for a short time when they wouldn't have had any reason to log beofre. It doesn't really take away from raiding, PvP, or other longer playtime activities. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - May 15 - 18<br />
We are hoping to have PTR login/access issues resolved by tomorrow, and are adjusting our planned testing accordingly.<br />
<br />
From tomorrow through Monday, we will continue our Hellfire Citadel raid testing, including both Heroic and Mythic raid testing. As is always the case with PTR raid testing, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt our plans. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic difficulty requires a fixed 20 players. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all PTR servers.<br />
<br />
Thursday, May 14<br />
<br />
CANCELED<br />
<br />
Friday, May 15<br />
<br />
Socrethar the Eternal - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 11:30 PDT (14:30 EDT, 20:30 CEST)<br />
Archimonde - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
After Heroic raid testing concludes on Friday, we will open the Bastion of Shadows Raid Finder wing, including Iskar, Socrethar, and Tyrant Velhari, over the weekend.<br />
<br />
Monday, May 18<br />
<br />
Shadow-Lord Iskar - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Hellfire High Council - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Account Issue<br />
We are aware of an issue affecting multiple users' PTR accounts and are actively looking into a fix. We will do our best to keep you informed of any status updates, and will let you know if the raid testing schedule needs to be adjusted or pushed back. Thank you for you patience while we investigate into this matter.<br />

On PTR says new glad mounts are account wide, I'm guessing this is a tooltip error?<br />
Correct. They are not account wide. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/595798906291748864))<br />

<br />
Partially, to some extent... <br />
Pretending they have some sort of control over it or it was intended by saying they don't want to prevent players from leaving if they want (what?!).<br />
<br />
Good luck getting players, who left in a blink of the eye in masses for a reason, to come back to do rehashed content, more garrison missions and boring LFR. Even if they come back they will leave again in no time because the content doesn't last.<br />
<br />
<br />
The social aspect of the game is very important to the overall experience.<br />

<br />
Yeah, keep telling yourself. Sidestep around the problem that the &quot;sandbox&quot; model just doesn't work, that there isn't much in the way compelling non-instanced content. You reach 100 and the world becomes almost redundant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm glad they acknowledge the problems with dungeons. I'd like to see badges back or an equivalent reward, I really miss having a reason to do 5 mans.<br />
&quot;Classes are more complex now - cherry picked example from tbc&quot;. This is the kind of thing that annoys me and feels really disrespectful to the audience. Anyone who has played the game for that long knows on balance rotations and ability choice are much fewer and simpler now. <br />
Like their assessment of Garrisons, it's been getting a lot of undue hate but I really think the problem is a lack of things to do outside the garrison rather than the garrison itself which has proved useful and a good design idea. <br />
The &quot;people don't play WoW all year anymore&quot; part and the weaker social environment sort of tie in with one another so I'm disappointed to hear they're &quot;ok&quot; with this style of play which in my view will weaken the game world for people who do want to play consistently for months or years as the game world will be filled with tourists looking for quick rewards and a quicker exit.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The fact that they raised the price of the expansion and pushed strongly for a 2 tier yearly expansion probably suggests they expected something like this. They know more of the audience than ever before are only interested in new expansion content and are pushing for a higher price on them and greater frequency of releases to cash in more on those people. <br />
I hope that's not the case where expansions have become cheap and quick cashgrabs that are poorly supported until the next expansion but it does appear to be heading that way. If true it means Blizzard would genuinely not care about the 2.9m loss since they'd be confident about getting them back (briefly) for the next expansion, which isn't long to wait in their new cycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If obviously true but it's also sad they admit having no idea on their own, no &quot;vision&quot; about what a mmorpg should be.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
_ Others mmorpg are doing housing ? Ok, lets do garrisons.<br />
_ Others mmorpg are doing dynamic events ? Ok, lets add random rare spawns à la Timeless Isle<br />
_ Others mmorpg have mercenary ? Ok, lets add followers<br />
_ Others mmorpg have guild events/quests/castle ? Ok, lets add a couple of guild perks.<br />
_ Others mmorpg have scalable content ? Ok, lets scale 10 old dungeons.<br />
_ Others mmorpg let you wear gear any way you want ? Ok, lets add transmogrification.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Notice the problem ? They copy other games features... but make them LESS COMPLEX, therefore less interesting/fun.<br />
<br />
Overall, it proves they don't know where they are going. Maybe tomorrow they'll focus on raiding... or maybe on daily quests... or maybe they'll try to add more social features... or pet battle... or maybe the opposite! Who knows ? Not them that's for sure!<br />

<br />
Lol, I started when I was 18 in vanilla, now I'm 28 and I have a kid go to school/work and I find the lack of content astounding. Garrisons is not really content, at all. Make us go back into the world, give us dynamic events, give us rep factions with useful/fun rewards. Give use new dungeons with every new tier release. Give use resources to gather in the world, be it gathering mats or valor points or coins. Give us real player housing, guild halls something cool we can customize. Give use reforging back, give us armor dyes... so much fun/cool stuff they could add.<br />
<br />
this game went from having to spend way too much time to gather stuff, grind for stuff to having to do nothing and stand in a small part of the map, instanced and que up for stuff.<br />

These 2 hurt so much, I had so much fun in Rift and GW2 with dynamic events. If done well, with proper resource/rep grinds/dailies/pvp, real dynamic events are the answer to open world content.<br />

He probably could. If you think WoW requires some special ability or talent, you might want to step outside and re-evaluate things a bit. WoW has been, and always will be, a casual game at heart. <br />

All raiding, even on the &quot;highest level&quot;, merely requires time and some modicum of patience when you wipe so you people learn where to stand and when to use their abilities which are now laughably few.

Then again you can say that about pretty much anything that might be considered &quot;skill requiring&quot;, especially in the case of video games.<br />
<br />
WoW is casual, but casual in playtime. If it was &quot;easy&quot;, all groups that tried Mythic would have beaten it, and yet you see many groups stuck in progress for weeks and weeks.<br />

<br />
It's not the game that's asocial, it's the community. The game &quot;helps&quot; that attitude linger, it's true, at least more than it did before all the instant speechless queues. The game only &quot;allows&quot; players to do it, players are still the ones at fault, not the game.<br />
<br />
Peopel ARE asocial - they just use the game mechanics that do not force them to be &quot;social&quot; as an excuse to do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
People make the game anti-social.<br />
Social is not simply pushing players into proximity with each other.<br />
Daily heroics in Dalaran proved that.<br />
Rarely would anyone say 2 words during a dungeon run.<br />
They still don't in random dungeons.<br />
<br />
Being social is WANTING to interact or talk to others.<br />
Not being forced to interact or talk with others, not because it is a necessity to complete a task.<br />
There are more tools, more options to form groups with random players.<br />
Better tools to continue communication with them across what would otherwise be difficult barriers like realms/factions/different games.<br />
Just people aren't willing to use them, instead blaming blizzard for their own lack of effort.<br />
<br />
I can go down the street yelling rude names at people.<br />
By most arguments because I am communicating with people that is called social.<br />
But here in the real world that is described as anti-social for a reason, because communication for the sake of communication does not equal being social.<br />
<br />
Players make the game anti-social, not blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Right right. When you bitch and moan towards the developer, you call it &quot;criticizing&quot;. Sugar coat it all you want, it's still whining. <br />
And despite this, you're still paying $15 a month for something you dislike. And even if you have unsubbed, you're on this forum douching up the place about a game that has no significance to you anymore.<br />

Yes, as a paying customer, I am rather disappointed with their performance, and this is why I'm informing them or discussing it with others.

No, I'm pretty sure the person douching up the place is the one who barges into threads with valid criticism linking crying baby videos that apply more so to his fragile self and goes &quot;ANY POST THAT DOESN'T AGREE WITH BLIZZARD IS WHINE.&quot;. So yeah, you're pretty much the dude douching it up, so long as this is not &quot;the Blizzard fanboy forums&quot;, you always be the one douching it up if you make posts like that.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to be the one douching it up, actually make some valid points, instead of just trying to be witty and linking some stupid video that more so befits your own behaviour than anyone else's.<br />

Actually, evidence supports their claims. This includes:<br />
<br />
There shift to more frequent expansions.<br />
The idea of releasing more content patches faster (albeit yet to be seen).<br />
Statistical and stochastic analysis of subscription trends.<br />

So without community Blizzard will be NOTHING! .... so if community is enjoying Blizzard games... Blizzard is happy and he is growing... but when major part of the community see what is going on with WoW NOW, we can see, that people are not enjoying the game anymore (I feel with you PVP Players). So Blizzard after many years tried something... they talked to each other and said: WoW has great community, alot of players playing WoW.. and WoD will be the biggest success in WoW history with over 10 milion players.... so we need money... We gonna try milk people via microtransactions... people are so passionate about this game and they will never quit it and they will forgive us this expansion. Let´s slack a little bit and let´s try to release rehashed content and some bullshit like selfie camera and twitter. We will make less effort to the content and at the same time.. we will make more money and game will be more profitable. ..... But Blizzard´s plan failed. Community is not happy about this and players cry out for more efficient content.... So Blizzard should start to do something before it will be too late. Because as Mike Morhaime said at Blizzcon.... Blizzard is there where he is thanks to US ... the Community. I know that game is OLD, but still has so many players who wanto to enjoy this game, but Blizzard ruining it in WoD. Thats my opinion....</div></div><hr />

Sidestep around the problem that the &quot;sandbox&quot; model just doesn't work, that there isn't much in the way compelling non-instanced content. You reach 100 and the world becomes almost redundant.<br />
<br />
It was at redundant at 80 and 85 as well until the Tournament and Firelands areas opened. At 70, adding the different flight accessible faction areas was interesting way to get players outside. At 90, the beach battle, thunder isle, and timeless isle were marginally okay. I expect Tanaan to be similar. Prior to the addition of these 'areas' the world is always redundant for level capped beyond their first gear up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arcaneshot</div><div class="date">2015-05-15, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All raiding, even on the &quot;highest level&quot;, merely requires time and some modicum of patience when you wipe so you people learn where to stand and when to use their abilities which are now laughably few. There is no magical &quot;this requires extraordinary ability, skill or understanding&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's hilarious watching people try to promote mythic raiding as some sort of 'high skill cap' activity when it's essentially repeating the same routine and merely learning the steps. I guess if you have no real talents in life, you have to try to patch it up in a game.<br />
<br />
Frankly in my head I'm completely awesome and Mythic is a pushover. <br />
<br />
But then in reality, I'm one out of 20 people and being that awesome in my imagination doesn't translate to reality.<br />
<br />
It's very easy to state that raiding is easy, but then once you're there that imagination that you're completely awesome is put to the test. And honestly I think that's the main reason why most of the &quot;raiding is easy&quot; camp actually aren't raiding because doing it for real would shatter the illusion that they're that awesome.<br />
<br />
And before you think you can make a smart comeback, people also think these sorts of things about sports, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it IS kinda impossible to be in touch with 7~10 million people with very different tastes.<br />
<br />
Some people will have loved WoD, while others hated it. Just like many people hated MoP, and many loved it. Same for every other state of the game / xpac. ANYTHING they can come up with, will be enjoyed by some and disliked by others. They can't please everyone, and they can't reasonably be in &quot;touch&quot; with everyone's wishes.<br />
<br />
If anything, they need to be more conservative when listening to feedback. 1, 10 or even 100 people voicing a concern/wish might mean something, but it also might mean absolutely nothing and lead them into changes a lot more people will dislike.<br />
<br />
You might say they've put themselves in this place for trying to catter to everyone, but it doesn't change the fact they are overall in a very hard and delicate position, not because of their work output, but because of the ammount of so different and contraditory expectations their playerbase has.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what the giant complaint about Garrisons is this time around. Were there this many river tears when flying combat didn't happen in Wrath? Frankly, Cata, MoP, and WoD have all been disappointments to me. Cata promised a return to difficult dungeons and failed to deliver; then they made them easier. MoP provided little in the way of dungeons and even less in WoD. Sure, the MoP and WoD dungeons have been great the first few times. But the number and rewards have been lacking. The complete removal of Scenarios has been depressing too. While I didn't use them much I liked the spirit of them and looked forward to more of that model. <br />
<br />
Whatever the case, I was one of the people who dropped the monthly payment in January. I bought WoD, leveled 5 toons to 100, collected some stuff, and quit for a few months. As of summer break I'm back in. Shit happens. I think people need more breaks from WoW.</div></div><hr />

This may be the biggest bit of bullcrap in the entire interview, since its just so blatantly wrong.<br />
<br />
Why bother going to collect crafting mats if all the crafting stuff is tied behind waiting on your garrison building to get you the proper material?<br />
All end game questing comes from and ends in your garrison<br />
Most of peoples gold gain comes from garrisons<br />
Most of the things players do, they do to upgrade their garrisons<br />
<br />
Garrisons do take awat from other activities because blizz put all the stuff you used to do outside of garrisons, in your garrison. And they're doing that shit again in 6.2. Why did they even do this interview? It's so fully of lies and question dodging that its just going to piss even more people off. If they had just admitted their faults people would have been glad of blizz, and blizz really needs some good pr right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Shift the blame onto the players for not wanting to play rather than accept the fact that you made a half-assed attempt of an expansion.<br />
- Claim that Patch 6.2 is the largest patch ever, when in reality, we'll be out of stuff to do in a week because they forgot to add a reason to leave our garrisons. Only allowing you to obtain Felblight through gathering means farming gold to buy it is a better use of your time. And you don't farm gold on Draenor, unless you're a masochist.<br />
- Classes are the complete opposite of complex nowadays. A spellbook with half of the original spells and hidden passives, removal of many stats over the years, and simplifying universal mechanics does not equate to more complex.<br />
- More people are currently doing organized raiding because there's nothing else to fucking do. I'd love to see the success rate per boss on Normal Highmaul for these groups made through the new tool. I can guarantee everything after Kargath is pretty low.<br />
- The convenience features added over the years have made the game so antisocial, I had to find the right kind of guild this expansion to make any sort of friends. I've still yet to make any long-term friends since Cataclysm hit. It might help if guilds weren't collapsing left and right expansion after expansion.<br />
- Garrisons give players a reason to log in for a short time when they wouldn't have had any reason to log in before because there is no other reason to log in. When you take away dailies, the reason to go out and mine/herb, the reason to farm dungeons, and any form of world content, you're left with what we have. Raid or don't play.<br />
- Group finder is an absolute failure at helping you meet new people when 99% of them are not on your realm. It might also be the fact that people only care about loot and will drop in and out on a per-boss basis, but what do I know. I'm just a random person playing the game and not a dev who seems to stare at numbers all day rather than actually play.<br />
- Pretty sure accessibility has hurt the game. When a new player can reach max level doing everything wrong, hop into content that he/she was never prepared for, and then get slammed by people who aren't willing to put up with that, you probably have one less player. How many tanks are we down to by the way?<br />
- Where the section with PvP? You know, that thing you touted as being this amazing new zone with our capitals at each end? Yeah, I thought so.</div></div><hr />

People certainly werent happy about the cut flying combat, but on the other hand blizz did add legit new content for pvpers, which they did not do in wod. Every expansion has cut content, MoP seems to have cut more than they added. Thats the big issue of wod: more steps back than forward, and no sign of it stopping.</div></div><hr />

I don't normally come out and just call someone an outright liar, but that is what you are. If you had played every class in TBC there is absolutely no way that you could say they weren't more complex, unless you don't know what complex means, but then that would just justify that you are too dumb to have even played one class, at least correctly in TBC.</div></div><hr />

If the world is so small and pointless and you're never out there, what do you people want to do on a flying mount? Sit on top of your garrison buildings?<br />
<br />
Because people are interested in doing some achievs etc but hates the game and cba when your stuck in spires of arak for get over a cliff and feel it's waste of time to return to the fp to fly past it for another fp and run back to it, or run around the cliff until you can get over it.<br />
<br />
it's fking waste of time and it is stalling your goals/things that you were about to do. so in the end when you do them, it doesn't feel like rewarding<br />
<br />
<br />
just because you decide to play the game just like checking your mails by logging on once a day or twice for check garrison stuff and then just portal to raids, doesnt mean everyone is doing the same as you.<br />
<br />
<br />
they promised us flying in 6.1 and some of us hated the fact that we had no flying from the beginning. <br />
<br />
and still no fking words about flying in 6.2<br />
<br />
if people doesnt like flying then don't fly. but i think it's retarded that does that likes flying are forced to play the same game that are fine with it, which is imo retarded.<br />
<br />
<br />
my to do list is still there once i get flying. and if blizzard won't release flying before next expension well fk it, im not going to do them then. so for me they can keep waste effort on releasing wierd contents as i just wont take part of them. and imo those things will then go under the &quot;no content, stupid game&quot; list.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit. Classes have NEVER been more simple. Also funny how he brought up spamming Shadowbolt, just look at Arms Warriors now.<br />
<br />
How can you even say classes are more simple now? Back in BC I played my hunter with a fucking macro. A MACRO. And there were no problems.<br />

Did you perhaps ever play a Ret paladin before Cata? How about a mage of any type before then? What in the hell gives you this mistaken idea that rotations were complex in the early days? You're either wearing nostalgia goggles or you never played pre-WotLK.<br />

Played Warrior, Mage &amp; Rogue since 2005, do you think the Arms rotation is more complex today? Do you think Mages are more complex when all specs are forced into 1 school of magic? This isn't just about rotations, but PvP utility etc. Classes have never been this stupidly easy to play.</div></div><hr />

The most important thing they could possibly learn is that you're never, ever going to please seven million people. So the best thing to do is ignore the vocal minorities and keep building a game their way, and not your way. I trust them more, personally. I'm having a blast in WoD. To be honest, the game has become even more casual, and it makes it easier for me to play in my limited free time as an adult/father/husband/professional compared to where I was back in 2006 or whatever.

Nice used of &quot;denied.&quot; I appreciate your dedication to sperging.<br />
<br />
My point (and blizzards point) is that the majority playerbase has changed over time. They grew up. The game is going to cater to the majority, because there's no money to be made in trying to please extremely vocal idiots who in reality comprise miniscule percentages of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Thus, casualization. A game that fits my busy schedule, and adapted so that I can still play with the friends I've had for ten years. Major kudos to Blizzard for doing it, too. Sorry you don't feel the same way.</div></div><hr />

Looking up where to spend 51 talent points to be &quot;MAX EFFECTIVE 1337 DPS RAIDERMAN&quot; is not complex. It's pointless.<br />
A rotation that consists of three extra variations of &quot;Do damage to the enemy&quot; is not complex. It's bloated.<br />
Having Scare Beast is not complex. <br />
<br />
Knowing that Thrill of the Hunt procs can change my marksmanship rotation when interacting with my 4p? Complex.<br />
Being able to squeeze more DPS out of a fight by choosing Crows over Stampede and sniping adds to reset the cooldown? Complex.<br />

You are so funny. Looking up where to put 7 talents is more complex than per say having 7 ranks of the same spell in your spell book? Just so you know, most specs in the game now have very few actual talent choices when it comes to dps/hps/tps. BUT YOU are probably smarter than all of those top end raiders that theory craft. <br />
<br />
PS the Rubix Cube is solved with a simple algorithm, its not that complex. Complex definition: consisting of many different and connected parts. So its me who doesn't understand complexity, its you.<br />

You realize there are plenty of classes that change talents from fight to fight, right? That NEVER could have worked in BC, because there was ONE optimal spec for everything. Just because every class isn't in the right spot for that yet doesn't mean it's not the right direction, are you even kidding me with your bullshit right now?</div></div><hr />

You literally show up in every single comment thread to bitch about the same goddamn thing you've known wasn't happening for months.<br />
<br />
Like...why do you even need to fly? I log into my garrison and take one of the ogre portals towards BRF and get there in a minute. <br />
<br />
If the world is so small and pointless and you're never out there, what do you people want to do on a flying mount? Sit on top of your garrison buildings?<br />
<br />
flying is freedom to do what i want and why i do this!<br />

Looking up where to put 7 talents is more complex than per say having 7 ranks of the same spell in your spell book? Just so you know, most specs in the game now have very few actual talent choices when it comes to dps/hps/tps. BUT YOU are probably smarter than all of those top end raiders that theory craft. <br />
<br />
PS the Rubix Cube is solved with a simple algorithm, its not that complex. Complex definition: consisting of many different and connected parts. So its me who doesn't understand complexity, its you.<br />

Careful you'll hurt yourself with such capitalized laughter. Using your definition of complexity, how isn't modern WoW complex? It is still made up of many different parts; you just don't have to waste your time choosing optimum builds from WoWpopular since trees consist of nothing but abilities now. All the worthless talents are now baseline. Like with my BC macro, you simply don't have to worry about anything, it just works.</div></div><hr />

As someone who used this macro to succeed in all aspects of the game during BC, I find your link quite nostalgic. I also find it quite hilarious that you actually believe there was an ounce of complexity to classes pre-Wrath. The most complicated thing people did was use different spell ranks because of mana issues. OOOOOOOOOOOO such complexity!!!<br />
<br />
Thank you for pulling out the actual hunter macro I was referencing BTW, since Solarth was asking about it and I was way too lazy to look it up. I'm gonna go do something else, fight the good fight : P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also:<br />
_ Others mmorpg are doing housing ? Ok, lets do garrisons.<br />
_ Others mmorpg are doing dynamic events ? Ok, lets add random rare spawns à la Timeless Isle<br />
_ Others mmorpg have mercenary ? Ok, lets add followers<br />
_ Others mmorpg have guild events/quests/castle ? Ok, lets add a couple of guild perks.<br />
_ Others mmorpg have scalable content ? Ok, lets scale 10 old dungeons.<br />
_ Others mmorpg let you wear gear any way you want ? Ok, lets add transmogrification.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Notice the problem ? They copy other games features... but make them LESS COMPLEX, therefore less interesting/fun.<br />
<br />
Overall, it proves they don't know where they are going. Maybe tomorrow they'll focus on raiding... or maybe on daily quests... or maybe they'll try to add more social features... or pet battle... or maybe the opposite! Who knows ? Not them that's for sure!<br />

<br />
&quot;Patch 6.2 is one of the largest content patches ever released.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is probably true, the trick is how you measure the patches. Check the Mb's ... I bet it is the largest as the patches are always getting larger and will always be larger than previous expansions because the models and art are better (bigger)</div></div><hr />

Summary: We will do the same garrison missions in every single expansion patch, we will do Apexis dailies, we will farm rare elites, and then .... we will play our characters without any changes..... so Now I understand what Blizzard means with achievement &quot;Time is a Flat Circle&quot;<br />

Last reply you get, because your special snowflake bullshit coupled with being as wrong as you can possibly be is really starting to grate my nerves.<br />

&quot;different and connected parts&quot;<br />
<br />
Take the Survival rotation. I have a Focus bar, a slowly regenerating resource. I have Cobra Shot, which generates Focus. I have Arcane Shot, which I use to dump the excess and apply a DoT. I have Explosive Shot, a powerful ability. I also have Black Arrow, another DoT. Black Arrow procs Lock and Load for free explosive shots on a somewhat random chance. I need to use all of these abilities as much as I can to do optimal damage while somehow not starving myself on focus.<br />
<br />
All of those abilities are different, yet they are completely connected to one another, and also connected to the ebb and flow of the focus bar. BUT WAIT, there's more! With my 2p bonus, I know that Black Arrow will cause a guaranteed Lock and Load. So now I have to plan my usage of these abilities in a way that allows me to use my most powerful skill the maximum amount of times. With my 4p, I know Explosive Shot increases the damage of my multistrikes, which means that with high multistrike chances (from my procs and gear set that I specifically tailored to my spec, but that's just gravy) I should prioritize Arcane Shot in certain situations because of it's higher initial damage...<br />
<br />
Compare this to my WotLK Marksman hunter. I had Chimera Shot, Aimed Shot and Arcane Shot. I also had Serpent Sting, Steady Shot, Silencing Shot, etc. So many buttons! But these abilities didn't interact with eachother in any sort of complex manner. It was a series of buttons I had to hit. There was never a situation where I went &quot;Damn man, I need to prioritize this over this because of my procs/what's going on.&quot; It was using abilities in the same order every single time. Shit, Silencing Shot was macro'd to every one of my buttons because fuck it, extra damage. On top of that, outside of 1-2 select gimmick fights, your resource of choice (Mana) was in literally zero danger of ever running out. There was no resource juggle.<br />
<br />
Which of these is more complex? The one with more buttons or less buttons?<br />

So at of all that, I guess you didn't have any set pieces until wod, I guess rapid fire was put in in wod..... Lets see, <br />
Chimera Shot -<br />
You deal 125% weapon damage, refreshing the current Sting on your target and triggering an effect: Serpent Sting - Instantly deals 40% of the damage done by your Serpent Sting. Viper Sting - Instantly restores mana to you equal to 60% of the total amount drained by your Viper Sting. Scorpid Sting - Attempts to Disarm the target for 10 sec. This effect cannot occur more than once per 1 minute.<br />

of money every month and dont even give that money back to costumers, you re going to justify every Blizzzard action as fair<br />
because you are a Fanboy, your logic is if i'm happy everybody should be happy, you re giving me as excuse connect the world together<br />

I see you're upset. It's a common side effect in people who are wrong and get called out on it. So Chimera Shot had exactly ONE baked in interaction, OK. And yes, there were set bonuses.<br />
<br />
(2) Set: Your Auto Shots have a 5% chance to cause you and your pet to deal 15% additional damage for 10 sec.<br />
(2) Set: Your pet deals an additional 5% damage<br />
<br />
There are some examples of the exciting and &quot;complex&quot; set bonuses that existed in WotLK. I wasn't even going to post them before because they just make you look even more foolish, but I'm getting pretty sick of your nonsense.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship in WoD is also lightyears ahead of Marksmanship in WotLK, but I wanted to use a really spiffy example so I went with my favorite spec. You don't want to see me break it down again, it'll be embarrassing for your sad argument :/<br />
<br />

<br />
They're getting more from Hearthstone and Heroes now for much less work. WoW right now became a &quot;bonus&quot;. And they're trying to make WoW go that route with only the initial xpac patch (6.0 for WoD for example) having major new stuff (and we pay some good cash on it on top of the sub). The later patches with less and less stuff just to keep it going (more and more reused stuff and easy to create content like new missions for garrisons) like a new raid here and there.<br />
<br />
WoW is just not the main product anymore, sry.<br />

I wonder when people will finally get to them about saying all that crap about &quot;content&quot; in their recent patches:<br />
<br />
&quot;New Content and Patch 6.2<br />
Patch 6.2 is one of the largest content patches ever released.<br />
Patch 6.2 adds Timewalking and Mythic dungeons, making group dungeon content relevant again.<br />
Patch 6.2 iterates on existing systems, polishes things, and adds some new content.<br />
Massive class overhauls aren't as likely to appear in content patches anymore, as returning players come back to find that their class has changed once again.<br />
The amount of content added in a patch is a balance between satisfying the hardcore players that go though content very quickly and the players that go at a slower pace.<br />
The team also has to make progress on future projects that are important while still working on upcoming content patches.<br />
Certain types of changes are reserved for expansions rather than patches to keep complexity in check.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not new content. Timewalking and Mythic dungeons are not new content. It's old content relevant again, not new content. It's like when they've tried to count lfr/normal/heroic as diferent bosses and extra content... 10 bosses in 3 difficulties are not 30 new bosses.<br />
<br />
System polishing is not new content.<br />
<br />
Class overhaul is not new content.<br />
<br />
A new map with nothing to do other than farming mats and do a few achievements/dailies isn't a &quot;largest content ever&quot;, it's the same as timeless isle.<br />
<br />
6.2 is, by far, not one of the largest content patches ever released. Any patch with a raid will match that. To claim that, it would mean that only 4 or 5 patches reached that, but if basically almost all patches have the same size/kind of content, then we can't say something like &quot;the largest ever&quot;... only 6.1, 5.1, 5.3 and a few other &quot;fix stuff/balance patches&quot; looses to 6.2 basically. All the patches with real content (like a new raid) are on the same size content wise.</div></div><hr />

It's a common side effect in people who are wrong and get called out on it. So Chimera Shot had exactly ONE baked in interaction, OK. And yes, there were set bonuses.<br />
<br />
(2) Set: Your Auto Shots have a 5% chance to cause you and your pet to deal 15% additional damage for 10 sec.<br />
(2) Set: Your pet deals an additional 5% damage<br />
<br />
There are some examples of the exciting and &quot;complex&quot; set bonuses that existed in WotLK. I wasn't even going to post them before because they just make you look even more foolish, but I'm getting pretty sick of your nonsense.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship in WoD is also lightyears ahead of Marksmanship in WotLK, but I wanted to use a really spiffy example so I went with my favorite spec. You don't want to see me break it down again, it'll be embarrassing for your sad argument :/<br />
<br />
Now go away, or go back to telling me I have Downs again (A+ class BTW) but please accept that the rotations for WoD are 5x what they were in earlier expansions even with less buttons. I'm done.<br />
<br />
Just gtfo of this thread you fcking fanboi. No person with any intelligence would come to the conclusion that you fanbois do. You bring up 2, 2 set bonuses and say see no interaction, never mind the 4 piece bonuses on those. Do you know why your bonuses are so good right now? Hunters would be shit without them. The bottom of the 4 pure dps classes. Why do we even bring a hunter to our raids, Fox and no one else can use a bow. That's it. Your logic, well there is no logic, only you seeing what you want to see. <br />
<br />
PS Chimera had 3 interactions depending on the sting you had on the target, which you dont even have a fcking sting spell anymore, its combined with arcane shotm but only for one fcking spec.</div></div><hr />

Also we get these shit naval shipyards that grant us the ability to do more garrison stuff. The exact same thing we complained about having or feeling like we had to do since the beginning of the expansion. While a lot of stuff remains unfixed. And these holiday things use stuff that is already in the game and that you have already probably been doing. They just add more rewards to them if you really need those types of rewards anymore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unbound</div><div class="date">2015-05-15, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you guys really think they do care about the 2.9m loss?<br />
<br />
While I do agree with most of what you wrote, you are wrong on this concept. The primary difference between 2.9 million subscriptions vs 30 million Hearthstone players is that the 2.9 million subscriptions represents a constant cash flow of over $100 million per quarter for little to no effort. 30 million accounts of Hearthstone likely only generates a few million (perhaps a couple tens of million tops) per quarter. While the effort to maintain / update Hearthstone may be less, it is unlikely small enough to overcome the massive profits of WoW subs.<br />
<br />
And it isn't the 2.9 million sub loss that has them heavily worried, because that is simply the number at the end of the quarter. Have they lost more since then? Blizz certainly won't give us (or their investors) an honest answer to that question. In fact, if there was any indication of the subscriptions having bottomed out earlier in the quarter and trending up, that is something the Blizz would have announced.<br />
<br />
So, yes, they really do care about the 2.9 million sub loss. In fact, this was predictable before the quarterly report was released. After messing around with selfie cams and twitter integration in 6.1, suddenly there is an explosion of lots of disconnected content that they want to release in 6.2. It reeked of desperation (it still does). Not all new content, but attempts to offer more types of content in the game because they very much want those subs with that sweet profit back.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, I didn't realize we were paying to play World of Tygor, and as long as hes satisfied we should be too. We have years of time investment in this game and we fight for it to be everything it can be. We don't take the BS like that interview as anything more than a slap in the face. So I mean tbh you knew what this post was going to be, if you just wanted to read the article fine, but don't get on your high horse and tell us to just throw away the last 10 years because you are enjoying the game in its current state....</div></div><hr />

Also looking at Blizzard Parato charter number of suscribed people was the highest ever (at WOLK). I remember when LFR was introduced we were all excited but that killed this game and took social part away. Reason im saying this is the following: back in vanila, BC and WOLK u had to find group to get your epics, by finding group you raid with that group for few night and if you click with people u ask to joined them and that was always sucess. Having LFRs, most new players will go into LFR and they will kill bosses for the week, they will see end game content and they will get bored. Reason they will get bored, its not only because they cleared end content cuz they have nobody to talk to. I remember when my guild that i raided with, we fell a part near end of Cataclysm and when i started Mop i could t find decent guild so i kept doing LFR, that got boring super fast and i quit until WoD was released. At release of WoD i found very cool guild and just by beeing and talking to these folks on daily basis is what keeps me playing. So Blizzard plz remove LFR next expension and bring social aspect back, let people earn epics proper way (u know what i mean by this) and let epics mean something like they use to back in the good old day. I have much more to say on this topic and if Blizzard lets me i would gladly talk about this at BlizzCon this year.</div></div><hr />

I really hate how skewed Blizzard's view is on literally everything to do with WoW. They spot something and you rejoice &quot;YES, its in their headlights. Finally they will do something about it&quot; But, nope, they somehow spin it so it appears to be a non issue, a positive or something out of their control<br />
<br />
<br />
The team was excited to see the number of subscribers increase with Warlords release, confirming they had selected the right idea and setting for the expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or, or, here me out... You baited them with promises, just like literally every other expansion. Only this time you delivered on even less of those problems. World PVP was shouted every 30 seconds by Holinka. Mythic was hyped up to be something new and exciting. We had Karabor and Bladespire. Garrisons were being talked about as if they were mailing every player a gold bar IRL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons give players reason to log in for a short time when they wouldn't have had any reason to log beofre. It doesn't really take away from raiding, PvP, or other longer playtime activities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously? Yes, of course it does. Because it was designed to be exactly like Farmville. It belongs on a web browser played by housewives. Yes, you spotted that Garrisons give you a reason to log in for a short time. What you didn't spot is that Garrisons remove all of the times you would log in to mine, collect herbs, do professions, go out and kill shit or just hang out in a populated area and talk. There is no reason at all to leave your Garrison because it simply is inefficient to do so. Inside Garrison = resources. Outside = NOTHING. Leaving your Garrison makes no sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
The convenience features added over the years have made the game slightly less social.<br />
<br />
<br />
SLIGHTLY<br />
<br />
<br />
The social aspect of the game is very important to the overall experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
But its only slightly less than say, WoTLK!<br />
<br />
<br />
More people are doing organized raiding than ever before thanks to some of the conveniences that have been added recently.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't forget the fact that there is zero other content for PvErs other than raids. Don't even say Challenge Modes to me, 8 dungeons that take a combined total of like 5 hours if you're good and a week if you're shit. 1 week out of 5 months. On the PVP front it is no different. PvPers are doing 3 year old - 11 year old battlegrounds and fighting lagging russians, ddosers and watching as their place in the rankings is bought by people with too much money. THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE TO DO OTHER THAN RAID.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes have been made to trim excess and keep things focused, but there is still a very high skill cap.<br />
<br />
<br />
If &quot;fun&quot; is access, then yes, you did trim it. Almost everything that defined a class is gone. It isn't a big one shot one kill style of fun removal. It is more a death by a thousand cuts. Every single spec in the game is now less fun than its WoTLK or even Cata counter part thanks to the efforts of Celes &quot;lol feedback&quot; talon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 is one of the largest content patches ever released.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh fuck off<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 iterates on existing systems, polishes things, and adds some new content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then they literally say that it hasn't got much content in the next line !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Massive class overhauls aren't as likely to appear in content patches anymore, as returning players come back to find that their class has changed once again.<br />
<br />
<br />
What about the hundreds of thousands (or millions) that quit because of class design? You got their expansion money, let them come back next expansion I presume? What about the near universally negative arms feedback? Do they have to wait too? Why paint everything with one brush, when it needs 34 different brushes?<br />
<br />
This is exactly the reason I unsubscribed. This feeling of lack of confidence and incompetence by the devs. They almost never even come close to focusing on the real issue and if they do, it is always spun into either a good thing, they ignore feedback or they just simply don't talk about it any more.<br />
<br />
We have saw this since the beta, where 6+ months of feedback was thrown in the garbage. Celestalons design philosophy of &quot;oh, it is universally hated now, but in 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months they will love it&quot;. Well Celestalon, we're over the 12 month marker now, and it doesn't look like many people are enjoying their classes, and do you know which ones aren't enjoying their classes the most? Thats right, the ones who complained the most during beta. Yes, what a coincidence, our minds haven't changed for an entire year despite everything.<br />
<br />
The complete sporadic nature of changes, removal of things etc. The best examples of course being pvp getting an out of no where blanket 10% reducation in damage taken across the board, to be removed a week later. Or execute being across the board nerfed, only to be reverted a week later and applied only to arms. HOW do these changes get through QA? When the average joe can instantly recognize why 10% reducation in damage is a terrible change that does nothing, why can't the devs? Did someone go into the office, throw that into the system and press enter? Do they even look at numbers at all? Do they have a basic grasp on the reality of the games state?<br />
<br />
Then you get Holinka. Everyone gives this guy shit, and fair enough, he made Ashran which we said would suck dicks from the get go (just like AV, just like IoC, just like WG, just like Tol Barad, just like Silithus, just like Zangarmarsh, just like Hellfire, etc) but at least that is half assed trying and it isn't going to ruin the core of the game (the classes) This guy must have the worst job in the universe. He has to sit in Celestalons unmoving shadow, hoping that he some how, beyond all reason, goes back on everything he has done in the past year and a half and let him make actual changes. God forbid if it hurts pve.<br />
<br />
The funniest part of the whole Holinka-Celestalon tip toe game, is that it gives the impression that Celestalon doesn't want any change at all. I would feel very sad if that was due to him thinking the classes are good right now. That would just be salt in the wound.<br />
<br />
TL;DR? Ignorance, incompetence and lies from the Devs. Near therapist like spinning of obvious problems to seem like they're actually not problems or that they're in fact good things. Yes, &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; is good, but when you're &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; while literally everything worthwhile is inside the box, your mind is in the wrong place. You could probably get better class and game design from Cleverbot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sliske</div><div class="date">2015-05-15, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like that they just expect subscriber loss now immediately after and expansion and like 2-6 months after a patch. That is so funny, especially when you look at older subscriber numbers. Vanilla, sure you can blow it off as new car smell or not reaching its peak. TBC too. But look at WoTLK. WoTLK grew and then stood at 12 million subscribers for 2 years straight without a single noticeable sub loss. It is only shortly after Cata, when most people agree that the game took a huge nose dive in quality that subscribers fell. <br />
<br />
Subscribers are directly indicative of the quality of the product in this case. It almost is a graph of how good the game is. While the vast majority of players enjoyed WoTLK the most, the subscribers meet that. While the second majority of the players liked TBC the most, the subscribers meet that. While most people disliked Early - mid cata and early mop. The subscribers meet that.<br />
<br />
Why, why do they try to pretend like these things aren't obvious. Surely it is a better route for everyone to go back to the WoTLK style of things? Take what is good from WoTLK and place it into the next expansion. Get rid of these boring talent trees. Give us our abilities back. Give us our professions back. Give us our reputations back. Give us our 5 mans from patches back. Give us new bgs, give us daily areas in expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some class's are boring and with a certain degree of issues yet they wont change that mid expansion because of possible returning players... they just don't care about the paying ones that kept playing, they want to please the ones that might return. Yet they claim &quot;It’s not about chasing numbers as much as [it’s about] making a fun game&quot;<br />
<br />
Unless something HUGE is coming in 6.2 that they are not telling us I don't see how adding something that was supposed to be there at launch, 1 raid tier, and re-tuning of older content is &quot;one of the largest content patches ever released&quot;. Hell, they didn't even bother with the Tier sets, they look terrible some of them being slightly modification of existing ones (Monk SoO head and HFC monk head).<br />
<br />
Making players not get locked out from boss's they have defeated contributed a lot to have more organised raiding, not the name change from Flex to Normal, nor Normal to Heroic. <br />
<br />
They claim they lose flexibility to make encounters if Mythic was 10 man, for instance they can't make encounters with 3 tanks for 10 man raids for mythic, yet they didn't have an issue with Dark Shamans Heroic in SoO where 10 man guilds did it with 3 tanks. What's the problem of guilds recruiting certain kind of class's I've seen that since I started playing in Wrath.<br />
<br />
I had no idea of this interview until I opened Mmo-champ but when I saw I had some sort of expectations that were shortly gone after reading it. Sounds like they don't play the game....<br />

It is instead the game itself in its current state (which is a giant improvement to be fair) that is pushing people off. <br />

Professions should be fixed tomorrow, 5 mans farming and Valor I thought was great personally, farming Reputation through either Tabards or Dailies was something to do that felt more worthwhile than farming mobs endlessly, and big expansive open zones instead of the more closed in cluttered mess that appears more recently.

Also, many people feel Shat and Dalaran are two of the best cities ever created and for some reason Blizzard have ran from that idea ever since. Do it again, it was awesome.<br />
<br />
Garrisons were also a great idea, but they kind of killed my desires to play alts. Same with the legendary quest lines. If I want to make an Alt now I have to level them, gear them, then also buy Blueprints again, get all of the followers (including the achievement ones) and level them then gear them again. Followed by collecting every part of the legendary quest line and trying to get it to the current point before the next patch is released. It just needs to be streamlined and made easier when being done on a second character.</div></div><hr />

This is 100% utter total nostalgia.<br />
<br />
Grinding 5 mans was boring as fuck.<br />
<br />
I did Violet Hold over 170 times in WotLK I would rather stick hot needles in my eyes than do that shit again.<br />
<br />
Yes I want more content, but I want more content like Harrison Jones quests and I actually now like the Apexis zones now they are not utter zerg fests there are actual fun mechanics (like getting transformed into a giant voidwalker @ Pillers of Fate).<br />
<br />
No I do not at ALL (ever ever) want to go back to grinding shity 5 mans over and over again.<br />
<br />
I want them to fix the reward structure which I 100% agree is broken, apexis gear itemisation is terrible and it is WAY WAY to expensive.<br />
<br />
I want them to add apexis rewards to everything we do (5 mans, Harrison Jones quests, pet battles etc etc).<br />
<br />
The reward structure around the weekly bonus events is a start imo.<br />
<br />
Also professions are better now than ever before (I will get flamed but hey I can have my opinion).</div></div><hr />

unsubbed? lol you played 5 days ago :cool:<br />
<br />
Playing 5 days ago doesn't mean that a person didn't unsub. They could have canceled their sub but continue to play until their game time runs out so as to not get boned even more. Or perhaps they canceled 5 days ago. :)</div></div><hr />

I just ran through a bunch of the old 5 mans yesterday on my 100, sure it was easy 1 hitting everything, but I still think a lot of those older 5 mans are pretty cool. It was also pretty painless to do Azjol Nerub or UK and be done in 10 minutes. Sure, it isn't the best system and it can feel monotonous but farming my dungeon a day for Valor was more stuff for me to do with some dailies sprinkled in. However, I will say I liked your other ideas. If the apexis system worked a little better and maybe it would have replaced all of that with a better idea. I don't know, I know we all have our own likes and dislikes but I'm just one of those people that enjoys having stuff to do in the game 5-7 days a week that keeps me logging on, whereas others want very little so they can raid on 2 nights a week and that's all.</div></div><hr />

Finally they will do something about it&quot; But, nope, they somehow spin it so it appears to be a non issue, a positive or something out of their control<br />
<br />
I agree about how wrong everything they said was, but I think even Blizzard knows that. What they say in public and what they think are two different things. Telling people &quot;Yeah we're greedy fucks who lost all the passion for games that made our company great 10 years ago, and it's kinda backfired with us losing 25% users in a few months&quot; will not make the stockholders happy, and it will not make the game more appealing to people.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will squeeze every penny out of this project. As the user base diminishes expect more store mounts and shorter expansions to compensate.<br />
<br />
Oh, and 6.2 having a lot of content? Adding more difficulties do now count as adding content. In TBC we got MgT, in WotLK we got ToC and the 3 ICC dungeons. In WoD we get the same dungeons instead but tuned higher. Double the developers, but less content than ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's like Blizzard is living in an entirely different reality now than the rest of us when it comes to WoW. Subs spiked with WoD because of how well they advertised and hyped it up. The setting helped, sure, but once people actually played the expansion, it was a totally different story. I was an adamant defender of the expansion, and now I feel like a complete fool for trying to justify Blizzards decisions with the expansion.<br />

<br />
You are conned. That is the whole issue. Billzard has changed a lot during last few years. 10+ years ago it was a driving force in the industry. Yes they did copy a lot from other games but they built on that and expanded things into an overdrive mode. When new Blizzard game was about to happen, you knew it will be THE thing. But the giant success of WoW started to devour it's creators. Blizzard turned into a fat and lazy slob who sits on his sofa all day long while chugging kegs of Mountain Dew bought for welfare money. They canceled Titan because it was a &quot;risk&quot;. Why take a risk if you can just keep milking 10 million addicted gamers? Why take effort to try and develop THE next best thing if you can throw out some silly card game developed in the basement during after hours and earn millions? Add some store mounts for good measure and the bank account will keep rolling. WoW was such a great game that it killed the passion and creativity inside Blizzard. I came to this realization after Titan was canceled. Instead we will get a MOBA which is a blatant attempt to steal some of the profits LoL is making. And the best thing they came up with to not waste all those Titan assets already produced, is a clear as day TF2 clone. Because, again, why bother, right? And then they come out and say that &quot;goal is to make a fun and engaging experience and not chase subscriber numbers&quot;? Ya dun goof'd.</div></div><hr />

This is not something blizzard can fix, nor should they. THey have given the tools to the players to form groups easily, if you are too lazy, dont have enough time or skill to do, there is nothing blizz can or should do to make it more accessible. <br />
<br />
They, instead, need to stop like raiding is the ONLY endgame, give the people who cant raid meaningful non raid content.<br />

To me this shows a lack of acknowledgment, they need to own up to what their mistakes are and reassure the players that they are moving forward with this knowledge and learning from it.

They're working on it. For starters they've banned over 100k accounts for botting some days ago according to this (http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/05/15/blizzard-hands-out-bans-to-more-than-100000-world-warcraft-players/). <br />
So that's another sub loss in the next quarter, albeit most likely a welcome one for the players who are still playing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-05-15, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted this on the other thread in the general forum:<br />
<br />
This interview was not done for the WoW player community. <br />
<br />
This article is from VentureBeat. Not a gaming site. An investor/tech blog. Who reads VentureBeat? Gamers? No. People who read VentureBeat either work in tech, or INVEST in it. <br />
<br />
This article is to appease any investors who may be uneasy with the sub loss. Period. Context matters here. This was not published in a space for gamers - the only reason the article is getting traction here is the journalist who wrote it posted a link to it. <br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard stock is at an all time high - and they want to keep it there. An executive at Blizzard dumped a million+ in stock last week, which is a big enough dump to warrant attention in the press...could be someone retiring and cashing out, could mean anything, but the timing is significant, like maybe an executive at Blizzard senses a top for the stock price, and is cashing in now. A lot of the analysts are bullish on Activision-Blizzard, or neutral. Another bad report with further sub losses in the future could tank the stock price, they need to send out an 'Everything is super!&quot; song and dance for them, and they did it, ably. <br />
<br />
That's why the interview with it's complete softball questions and no real insight or analysis makes any sense to us - it wasn't intended for us. It's intended for tech/gaming investors who don't actually play Warcraft but who threw down some cash for the stock. Ion is downplaying the sub losses for them, not us - we don't matter, when it comes to the stock price. <br />
<br />
Note that Blizzard has not addressed the sub loss to their own community on their forums or even on Twitter in any way, shape or form. That's mind blowing. They have an almost complete communication blackout with the players at the moment, the only info is dribs and drabs and one or two blue posts a week. <br />
<br />
I also looked at Ion's comments, and got that besides the &quot;cyclical&quot; spin, he's saying their audience has grown up. This is true, but does that warrant a complete redesign of the game? Of course not - and the loss of a 4 million sub windfall is the result. You SOLD the game right, but failed in delivery. Why? You're trying to cater to what you think new players will like, that kids only want farmville like experiences, and don't want to experience the leveling and questing aspect of the game, which I think is disastrously wrong. Kids are smart. They know that if they try an MMO, they know what they're getting into. They hear from their older siblings and peers about the Vanilla-Wrath experience, and want it for themselves, and when they sign up for WoW now...they don't get it. <br />
<br />
And, there's a reason why they didn't bring up PvP, they don't want to parade Holinka's failure in front of current and potential investors. Ion can't do a &quot;Everything is super - except PvP&quot; dance. <br />
<br />
Lets face it - Blizzard has a PR issue. Anywhere the game is discussed these days, it's not pretty, despite the efforts of white knights to drown out the complaining. Their sub numbers are in the tank. People are probably still leaving at a steady rate. The token, by their own admission hasn't effected sub numbers dramatically. If an investor or potential investor goes to their own forums, they'll mostly see unhappy players and a game that's so riddled with bots they had to ban over 100k of them. That's not a &quot;buy&quot; experience. Thus we get this article. <br />
<br />
You guys need to stop thinking everything is aimed at you. This article wasn't - you have to look at the context of where it was published, and who for. It's common sense that Ion is going to put on the Big Spin when talking to investors and potential investors. It's maddening, but it's a bigger game that only cares about you, the player, as a number to sell more stock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My faith in Blizzard has been rocked with the release of WoD.<br />
I came here to post pretty much the exact same when when I saw Hazzikostas trying to play it off with: &quot;The loss in subscribers is partially due to the cyclical nature of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
While there's obviously some truth to that, as everyone eventually experiences burnout and takes a break at some point, you hit the nail on the head that it shouldn't be happening this early in WoD. My burnout phase in MoP was a little in the middle due to World of Dailycraft until they made the appropriate changes, and then at the very end due to the longevity of SoO.<br />
<br />
But very early on in WoD, I found myself running out of fun things to do (and I'm a completionist achieve/pet/mount collector, so I'm usually not out of things to do). I ended up going to back to old content (like running ICC for Invincible, etc) or pet battles/archeology, the non-essential time-fillers that I usually save for later on in an expac. I found myself thinking, I shouldn't be running an old WotLK raid for content, when WoD is this new. I should've had more things keeping me busy like any previous expac, which we paid the same price for but got more bang for our buck.<br />
<br />
I realize they have to put a positive spin on it, but it's also irritating to think they're intentionally sticking their heads in the sand and ignoring the resounding outcry about the large lack of enjoyable, lasting content.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole &quot;published only to sell stock&quot; aspect... I get that. But we found out about it, we're the subscribers who pay money, and are getting used as a number by which they're selling stock to investors. They should be held accountable for what they're caught saying, even if it isn't directed at us, we still have a right to be miffed... even if it's a lie blowing smoke up the investors' collective behinds (which it might not be.)<br />
That's like if I told someone else I thought you were an idiot, you overheard, but hey I didn't say it to you so you can't be mad, right?<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; More people are doing organized raiding than ever before thanks to some of the conveniences that have been added recently.<br />
&gt;&gt; It would be nice if Mythic could scale with the raid size, but the team isn't sure that level of tuning is possible.<br />
<br />
I used to call myself a PvPer, but I haven't really done any this expac and gave up on Ashran. I only raid so much now because there's no alternative. I either raid, or I quit because I'm not going to pay monthly for nothing.<br />
I'd also love to do Mythic, but my guild can't quite muster the 20-man requirement. I frequently hear laments saying how they miss pre-WoD 10H raiding (which was essentially Mythic before the difficulty changes.)<br />
<br />
Not only has Blizzard failed to add much in the way of new content, but they've also gated, limited and/or ruined (PvP) other formerly enjoyed aspects of the game. This all contributes to the whole feeling that there isn't much to do.</div></div><hr />

As someone who has had that PR job, I can tell you that it's possible but not likely. Companies tend to hype themselves up even to their employees, so some of it depends on which end of that conversation the interviewee was on. There are also some who really and truly believe that they're always right and everyone else is wrong.<br />
<br />
The most likely scenario, however, is that it's a spin. While the person doing the spinning might not buy it, they're pretty darn confident that they can state it in a fashion so that the customer base will buy it. Keep up customer confidence that there's nothing wrong with the game, and they'll keep spending money. If your customer believes something is wrong with the game, they'll stop playing.<br />
<br />
In short: The chances that a Blizzard employee will ever come out and publicly say, &quot;Yeah, you guys are right. This game sucks as is,&quot; are slim to none. Yeah, it could happen, but it's highly unlikely.</div></div><hr />

I know a dozen people at least who have quit wow in the short term, 1 has said because of the above reason. All my other mates, including me left because the highlight of 6.1 was a glorified way to take a screen shot. <br />
<br />
At first, I was fine with no new content as the BRF was still reltively new, but you know what, it got two weeks into 6.1 and I clicked, Im literally doing the same couple of jobs a day, hoping for a epic, to make gold, to buy challenge mode boosts on all my alts (No I don't have a guild because Warcraft is the fucking worst game I've seen for people having drama in guild / clans / fleets), as well as running BRF. Then literally logging off. <br />
<br />
I might come back for 6.2 every few days when I check mmo I see a few things Id like, the time walker sounds amazing, then it said on holiday or bonus weekends, I could of swung for someone</div></div><hr />

I don't normally feel that way about one of their interviews so I am a little surprised at myself. I can usually see where they are coming from on most things when they do an interview, but this time.......wow. To me it was mostly horseshit.<br />
<br />
I can see how they expected sub loss. Hell, I did too. But sub loss of this magnitude so soon after an xpac release? I've never seen such a thing in my 10.5 years of playing WoW. And his response to it was just........clueless.<br />
<br />
6.2? Largest content patch? ROFLMAO!!! Garrisons keep people logging in once a day? Sure, but as someone who got very burnt out on raiding in Vanilla and TBC and no longer raids I want more to do than Garrisonville when I log in.<br />

So why, instead of making the same &quot;old&quot; dungeons relevant again, why not make new ones?<br />
<br />
Mythic dungeons is a really cool concept, but I don't think it will be relevant to our main characters for too long. Maybe for gearing up alts. But I would love to experience some new dungeons. Raids are the &quot;end game&quot;, but sometimes beeing able to do shorter contents in smaller groups is also interesting.<br />
<br />
Timewalking will give us some dungeon variety, will likely add some new challenges and bring some nostalgia to players, but how long will it be interesting?<br />
<br />
I know, making some entirely new dungeons must be some work, and eventually, the new dungeons are gonna become obsolete anyway, but I really wished for more dungeon variety in this expansion pack instead of just the initial ones. Pandaria all over again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toclafane</div><div class="date">2015-05-15, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Patch 6.2 adds Timewalking and Mythic dungeons, making group dungeon content relevant again.&quot; Nope.<br />
<br />
This was my thought on this. Two tiers for dungeons was good enough back in TBC, and people didn't get burnt out on them so darn much. We also had incentives for doing them through gaining rep or badges for items. This continued on through WotLK and Cata, and for the most part the community had no beef with it and even enjoyed it, aside from the &quot;welfare epics&quot; complaint from some raiders.<br />
<br />
WotLK also added the heroic element to dungeons and gave us two different raid sizes. This was okay, but players got burned out doing the same raids twice in one week, so Blizzard added a lockout for Cata where you could only do one or the other. Of course, when LFR was introduced toward the end of Cata, folks went right back to doing the same raids twice.<br />
<br />
We've since added Mythic raiding and Challenge mode dungeons, giving you yet another way to do the same dungeons. Folks are getting fed up doing the same raids and dungeons several times over, even if it's a different difficulty level. Two is fine. Three is pushing it, and four is overkill.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that they raised the price of the expansion and pushed strongly for a 2 tier yearly expansion probably suggests they expected something like this. They know more of the audience than ever before are only interested in new expansion content and are pushing for a higher price on them and greater frequency of releases to cash in more on those people. <br />
I hope that's not the case where expansions have become cheap and quick cashgrabs that are poorly supported until the next expansion but it does appear to be heading that way. If true it means Blizzard would genuinely not care about the 2.9m loss since they'd be confident about getting them back (briefly) for the next expansion, which isn't long to wait in their new cycle.<br />
<br />
This unfortunately sounds plausible, considering Activision.<br />

So far, what I've seen are a lot of people rightfully laughing at the &quot;this is our biggest patch so far!&quot; claim, and see the interview for the fluff talk it is. To you, that might be whining, but to me, the people who can't handle daddy Blizzard being criticized are the ones who are whining.<br />
<br />
First off, actually read the interview before failing to quote it. It said and I quote: &quot;I think 6.2 is one of the largest content patches we’ve ever released, between the dungeon features I talked about, our Adventure Guide, a raid zone, the Tanaan [Jungle] exterior zone, and the shipyard.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a difference between saying &quot;this our biggest patch so far&quot; and &quot;one of the largest content patches we've ever released&quot;. The distinction between these two sentences are in fact important, since one is factually incorrect while the other really isn't. 6.2 is a pretty large patch, but it is not the largest. That's a failure on your part to not understand what was said, not Blizzard's.</div></div><hr />

The team is fully non responsible for the dwindling subscribers' count, it's all external: cyclical nature of the game, change of habbits of players, and so forth.<br />
<br />
Also warlock and shadow bolt (wasn't it in vanilla btw?) to refute the dumbing down of the game. Because the class didn't evolve between then and MoP?<br />

Destro Warlocks in Burning Crusade raids would literally keep up one debuff and press Shadowbolt really hard and fast to beat everyone else. The game hasn't been &quot;dumbed down&quot; from that.<br />
<br />
Er...really? Not every spec was a 1-button spam spec like Destro or Beast Mastery. There were a lot of fairly complex classes, not just in rotations, but in talents and gear as well.<br />
<br />
Like prot paladins, how Reckoning was a shit talent unless you were Expertise capped. Yeah, it added lots of extra melee hits = more threat, but that also meant more chances to get parried which means more damage taken from parry-hasted enemy attacks. Therefor, you only took that talent when you had enough expertise to not get parried. And for actual gameplay, you had stuff like downranking Consecrate to save mana, or making sure to have a Righteous Defense macro and stuff like that. Whereas tanking nowadays is just....run in and spam your attacks on cooldown, and you get infinite threat on everything, it's literally impossible to pull aggro off the tank. Tanking nowadays is a joke compared to TBC.<br />
<br />
Or things like Surv hunter, where it has lower DPS than BM, but you provide a big boost to your raid's DPS by buffing other DPS' damage on the boss, and providing a good amount of utility to the raid through your stings and traps.<br />
<br />
TBC wasn't as dumb and straightforward as the devs make it out to be. Though that was partially due to clunky mechanics, weird talents, and bugs.</div></div><hr />

That is a giant load of horseshit. They have done literally nothing to differentiate 10m and 25m Heroic to 20m Mythic as they said they would at Blizzcon and as he suggests is happening in this Interview. Like, I don't really care all that much, but this shit killed my guild, this was after months and months of mass recruiting too. Mythic is pretty lame, sorry to say. If we actually got those unique mechanics and those unique encounters, it would be alright, if not better than heroic was, but right now its just 20m ONLY Heroic.</div></div><hr />
