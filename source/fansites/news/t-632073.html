Europe - Performance since Saturday<br />
During the maintenance in the morning of Saturday January 24th we did some tweaks to the load balancing for continents, raids and instances. While our continual monitoring of the realms do show improvements, we would also like to hear your personal experiences since Saturday. Please note that these tweaks deal with the performance itself, not the &quot;additional instances cannot be launched‚Äù matter.<br />
<br />
If you would please reply to this thread with a description of your game performance experience since Saturday morning, that would be greatly appreciated. Please include which realm you play on and what game content your feedback is about; raids, 5-man instances, Lake Wintergrasp, or other outdoor content (please specify which continent, e.g. Northrend).<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. <br />

Burst damage in PvP<br />
We have said we think burst is too high in PvP and we are working on changes. You can come up with different theories for why different classes are doing so well in PvP at the moment. Arcane mages can do a lot of damage in very few GCDs. Rogues can do a lot of damage quickly to CC'd targets. Death knights (probably more so before 3.0.8 ) had a lot of suvivability and paladins still have a lot of survivability.<br />
<br />
We don't want to announce changes here and there throughout various forum threads. When we are ready to announce the changes, you won't miss them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14637455103-can-we-please.html))<br />

Tanking Stats<br />

Developer Q&amp;A / Suggestions (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595170174-ghostcrawler-just-a-few-questions-plz.html))<br />
1. are all the locks tree's getting overhauled or just the demon tree?<br />
I am reluctant to use the word &quot;overhaul&quot; because that sets up an expectation for some players that is difficult to meet. We are changing some talents and spells in all 3 trees. <br />
<br />
2. like new pets for locks plz?? its been a long time some reg summons maybe switching 41 point to infernal and making fg a reg summon? we have no reg summons for 60 ,70 and 80 we need to keep up with other classes and lets make the game more fun for the people playing years<br />
Additional demons are something we would like to do at some point, but first we want to get all the current demons useful. Hunters have a lot more flexibility in which pet they pick. Locks need certain demons for certain jobs and we're not convinced yet that they are all there (particularly that female one). <br />
<br />
3. can we get a perma metamorph with a few nerfs for the QQers or will we have something new ? <br />
We think we have enough instances of characters turning into other forms already. <br />
<br />
3. faster dots? or cutting the dot timers down to make it seem like burst damage ? <br />
Adding some on-deamnd burst damage for locks is something we are looking at. <br />
<br />
4. maybe enslave demon being perma to kinda customize locks like the hunters ..im not asking to be as uber as hunters pets but we should almost match them since they are pet/burst class and we are pet/dot class <br />
Hunter pets are supposed to be more like life-long companions while warlocks tend to use and discard their demons as necessary. So we aren't really going for that one to one comparison. <br />

'cause it actually has changed since last time you played... just look in your temp folder, once you start the launcher it creates a copy of itself, with a new name everytime...<br />

&quot;Hunter pets are supposed to be more like life-long companions...&quot; Is that why they need stable space for five of them? Once Warlocks learn a demon's True Name, he becomes a life-long companion, too (until he kills the Warlock, that is).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hmm am I the only one that finds this odd? If we are ment to use and discard our demons as necessary shouldnt we have a HUGE selection to choose from? Why are we stuck with more or less 2 usefull ones (Imp and Felhunter and yea talking about pve)? If hunters are supposed to have them as &quot;life-long companions&quot; shouldnt they well... be life long? Alot of hunters I know are constantly chaning pets while I have had my imp with me.... well since I dinged 70 and stopped using my felguard. Plus when did you last see a lvl 80 imp in the &quot;wild&quot;? Why are we using such damn weak demons? Sounds more like the Imp has a life long warlock pet.. <br />
<br />
Also <br />
<br />
<br />
3. can we get a perma metamorph with a few nerfs for the QQers or will we have something new ? <br />

<br />
<br />
as a lock I say pff to that. Maybe like some half way ground? Wings or Claws or something that gives us a buff adds something unique to us but isnt a whole form? :P On that note there is probably a zero chance of us getting a demon travel form that we can fly in? :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenzimer</div><div class="date">2009-01-27, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I feel that having the ability to eternally enslave a demon sounds fun, the problem is it makes the class less unique. If warlocks want a ranged class with high pet damage they can go roll a hunter. However, it is a nice idea to bring back infernals, and even enslaving mobs in an instance. My thought is make it so that a Warlock can't banish and enslave at the same time, and make it so that Enslave Demon lasts for 3 minutes guaranteed. Then make it so that the Warlock can enslave again but with diminishing returns of -1 minute. This should allow Warlocks to keep an enslaved demon 6 minutes at the cost of 3 shards. This would be nice and fun for them, and would make certain trash pulls, and bosses really fun.<br />
<br />
The other problem would be something along the lines of it being required for good dps, but really from what I hear that spec is a little behind anyways, and in addition to that, because it would be just to hard to summon an infernal in arena then enslave it, it wouldn't affect PvP much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No matter how many times I try and discard my pet after i summon him, I seem to summon the same damn one over and over again ... must just be me.<br />
<br />
Srsly, that justification is weak as p*ss. Our demons are lifelong companions, moresothey will outlive us. We summon them from their native plane of existence, and then, when we are finished with them or their &quot;mortal form&quot; dies on our plane, they get &quot;banished&quot; back to their own plane, only to be re-summoned again later.<br />

Ditch doomguard. Who summoned this pet besides for fun? we have companions from game for fun. Do i want so many freaking companions from my abilities? <br />

Really ironic is, i only use IMP 24/7. At least now it survives this long that i can sacrafise it before he gets 1 shoted. And when do you sacrafise your 500 dps pet that gives you imba buffs? never!!!<br />
<br />
Does anyone use anything else? Felguard is good (to lol pvp and heroics) but thats about it. SO...we have 2 able pets. Using void on leveling is also laughuable, what does he do, besides receiving soullinks dmg? oh right, he can point out stealthed people? kmph* &gt;&lt;<br />
Why giving you a form, then saying too many ppl using forms already? LOL.<br />

<br />
Go summon him today, fully raid buffed the Doomguard has around 50k hp and crits for 5k on his melee swings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Additional demons are something we would like to do at some point, but first we want to get all the current demons useful<br />
<br />
Quite why we thought that removing Paranoia from the Fel Hunter and putting it on a Voidwalker who does next to no damage and can only be used in non-combat situations would be a good move in that direction, but hell lets just keep changing things at random until we get something right.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itsdarkandcoldoutside</div><div class="date">2009-01-30, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm was thinking with the locks what if we did get the ability to perminantly turn into demons but not in the same way as Druids etc. <br />
For example <br />
Imp form<br />
Turns the lock into an imp reducing agro by X amount but also reducing damage done. <br />
Succu/Felguard (think a different one depending on the chars gender could be fun :P)<br />
Increases melee damage but increases cast times too.<br />
VW<br />
Huge damage reduction but cant cast and or movement slowed<br />
Felhunter<br />
Alows collection of soulshards from all mobs killed that grant xp/honor but only able to use basic spells (those spells gained before you learn to summon the felhunter SB etc max level of the spell tho ofc)<br />
<br />
This way we get something very unique to our class, we are using and discarding demon abilitys and at the same time will spend most of the time in normal caster form since it does give the most damage. Some cd on changing probably needed but was generally thinking this could be a nice fun addition to the class while making us a bit more unique. <br />
<br />
Just an idea, what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />
