We want to give everyone an early heads-up regarding our plan to implement a guild relocation service for World of Warcraft. The idea is for a guild leader to be able to transfer a guild to another realm. The guild structure remains intact, including the guild leader, guild bank, ranks, and guild name (depending on availability).<br />
<br />
Guild members who decide to relocate with their guild may initiate their own paid character transfer. Upon a successful transfer they will automatically be part of the guild when they first log into the new realm. Their guild rank and guild reputation will be intact.<br />
<br />
Guild leaders who do not want a change of scenery may also choose to pick a new guild name using another new service. These services are in development and we will be providing additional details at a future point in time.<br />
<br />
As with all of the features and services we offer, we intend to incorporate the guild relocation service in a way that will not disrupt the game play experience. Please note that this feature will require extensive internal testing, so you may see bits and pieces of the service appear on the public test realms. We'll announce further details at http://www.WorldofWarcraft.com .<br />

Dev Watercooler: The View From 10,000 Feet<br />
So how is the view from way up here? It’s great actually -- we’re really happy with how Cataclysm is going so far, and we have big surprises on the horizon. On the other hand, there are details you can see at ground level that you can’t make out from 10,000 feet.<br />
<br />
When we started these blogs, the idea was to foster developer communication to the players without some of the inherent problems of posting in forums. Some players have pointed out recently, and we totally agree, that the blogs up until now have been from a very high vantage point. We looked for topics with universal interest that would feel important and newsworthy. That has worked overall, but we also feel like we’ve lost something from when I used to be down in the metaphorical trenches talking to players in the forums.<br />
<br />
So we’re going to try something a little different. We’re going to unleash some blogs that are much more conversational and less proclamational (that's a word now). If we deliver on this, it will hopefully feel like you’re eavesdropping on our design meetings. You won’t always learn a lot about exciting new features coming to the game, but you will (ideally) learn something about the design process itself. (When we have big, exciting news to share, or ‘State of the Game’ style blogs, we’ll still do those as well.)<br />
<br />
But to pull off this more casual blog style, let’s establish a few ground rules:<br />
<br />
1) No promises. I’m going to be talking about a lot of things we might do or things we could do. You shouldn’t interpret this brainstorming as patch notes. Our creative process is insanely iterative. We might pitch dozens of ideas before we find one we like. That can be really exhausting if you’re not used to it. If you’re more interested in final decisions and not idea churn, then this style of blog won’t be for you.<br />
<br />
2) Don’t read too much between the lines. I’m going to point out a lot of design flaws in our game. “Oh no! Goatcaller admitted WoW was deeply flawed! It’s shark-jumping time!” Look, Blizzard is very critical about our own designs. There is virtually nothing in World of Warcraft that could not be improved. That has always been the case and will continue to be the case. Just because I’m going to be sharing that more frankly with you doesn’t mean that the game now has more cracks in its foundation than it ever did. There is an old saying (misattributed, from what I understand, to Otto Bismarck) that laws are like sausages; it is best not seeing them being made. My old friend and mentor Bruce Shelley used to apply the same maxim to game design.<br />
<br />
3) No complaints about the topic. If we didn’t have an interesting discussion about a topic recently, e.g. shaman mechanics, I’m not going to invent one. That doesn’t mean that the class is perfect, or that we don’t love shaman players, or that the shaman class has no direction, or that the class design is frozen in carbonite. I’m not going to keep hash marks next to every class and spec to make sure I’ve covered their &quot;Very Important Issues&quot; lately in a blog. World of Warcraft design being what it is, we’ll probably eventually get around to talking about everyone on here, but it may take weeks or months or years. My team is responsible for areas of the game including classes, items, encounters, trade skills, achievements, combat, and UI, so my blogs will probably stick to those topics.<br />
<br />
Okay, all that preamble is out of the way now. I’ll probably refer back to it sometimes, if we have some players stomping all over the ground rules.<br />
<br />
One topic we’ve been discussing lately is the role of Hit and Expertise on tank gear (or more precisely, plate tanking gear). The conventional wisdom is that Hit and Expertise are threat stats, and you may need to swap them out with some of your mitigation stats depending on the situation. Realistically, unless you severely overgear the content, we don’t think that is actually true. Tanks almost always worry about survival first and foremost, which totally makes sense, and are willing to trade off threat stats for better mitigation in almost all situations. It’s much harder to progress if the tank explodes than it is if the cat occasionally pulls aggro. (It’s not quite that simple, but I’m going to gloss over details and exceptions since I spent so much text on the preamble up above).<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, taunts could miss, and so Hit was marginally more interesting than it is today. Once upon a time, having a boss parry your attacks could speed up its swing timer, which turned Expertise into a (often weak) survival stat. Boss parries felt very random though, both in the sense that sometimes the tank would suddenly take much more damage than anticipated and there was no easy way to know which bosses had parry speed up. (Today, you can assume none of them do.) Until recently, interrupts could miss, but asking a tank to stack a bunch of Hit just for those few opportunities when they were probably going to hit anyway but disaster would occur if they did not felt crummy too.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there aren’t a lot of stats that are interesting to tanks. Stamina and Armor are great, but their stat budget is often in lockstep with item level. (It would be interesting to consider if we could make that not the case once again, but that’s the topic for another blog.) We got rid of Defense as a stat that tanks needed to worry about. We have managed to make Mastery pretty good to excellent for tanks, so that’s at least one stat they like to see. Dodge and (if you’re a plate-wearer) Parry are good, and slightly interesting because of talents like Hold the Line. But beyond that, it starts to go downhill. Sure Haste and Crit can sometimes be fun, but really they often aren’t worth the trade off. That leaves us with Hit and Expertise. We’d like to make them more interesting to tanks. But how?<br />
<br />
One way is by turning them into defensive stats. They are defensive stats for Blood death knights, because the DK self-healing is tied into Death Strike, which can miss. It might be possible to do something similar for the other classes. Imagine if Shield Block had to actually hit the target. Presumably you raise your shield, but not high enough to intercept the incoming blow. Now hit becomes a mitigation stat for warriors as well. We might have to adjust the mitigation amount on Shield Block or give warriors a small Hit bonus so Hit capping wasn’t totally unreasonable, but you get the basic idea. You could do the same with paladins (make Holy Shield more interesting?) and druids as well (Savage Defense could proc on a hit).<br />
<br />
Is this a good idea? We’re not sure yet. You won’t see this change in the 4.1 patch for certain. There are trade-offs to making Hit and Expertise more valuable. Gearing as a tank might be more fun for experienced players, but it also might be more challenging for less experienced players. The number of struggling tanks in your Dungeon Finder groups might go up. Some less knowledgeable players (and to be fair, this stuff doesn’t exactly explain itself on the character sheet) might stack Hit way too high at the expense of a more valuable mitigation stat, such as mastery.<br />
<br />
It is the kind of thing we’re talking about though, and if you want to make a contribution to the tanking forums but aren’t quite sure on a topic, here is one potential possibility.<br />

So it's promising to at least see that being acknowledged.<br />
<br />
<br />
they sure have enough devs to make paid services compared to the amount of devs working on raid content<br />
Are you really comparing backend services to raids that require entire 2D/3D art teams as well as developers? You might as well complain they updated the armory's layout instead of doing another 5-man.<br />
<br />
<br />

They can do the same thing now (steal everything from bank, gdisband, etc) without it forcing them to use a credit card, if they get access to a Guild Master's account. Besides, if you run a guild that is even moderately big it's irresponsible not to have an authenticator.</div></div><hr />

I guess this means that if your GM wants to move, he will move and take the guild bank with him. Maybe you are not making good enough progress and he wants to try another realm. While giving a GM this power, the small guys like us ..... lose all our guild perks.<br />

Your guild membership is already at the pleasure of your leader. He doesn't need to change servers to dump you and place you on ignore.</div></div><hr />

Because backend coding is totally done by the same people doing encounter design and 3D modeling.<br />

Yup. <br />

guild transfer seems like a nice idea at first, then you realize it's a way to make more money with people with a lot more than the ridiculous gold transfer cap.<br />

<br />
That's what happens when you compare apples to oranges while using ridiculous assumptions with a &quot;hot topic&quot; like gold selling to try and make a point.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a business. Their first priority is making money. Believe it or not, appeasing the playerbase comes second. The only people that paid transfers will affect to the point of losing a subscription, are naive/ignorant kids that think making money is a bad thing. Stop trying to fight the man, because in an environment like this, the man will always win.</div></div><hr />

Don't you feel great? And we wonder why gold is able to be sold, and why paying to lvl a toon on a differnt server is so popular. i payed my buddy 20ucks to get a priuest to 85 for me in a week. saved me 5$ and gave it to someone in need. Do that guys. dont pay blizzard for garbage services. They arnt using your money to better the game. (Their budget is fixed) <br />

<br />
Well, making money is one thing, but remember Blizzard have to give something in return: a fun and fair game. I think providing this kind of service makes sense considering that guilds now have to be levelled up. Obviously, Blizzard doesn't want every guild to just start randomly doing it - that would ruin the experience for a lot of people. So, to make the experience best, they have to give some sort of disincentive to make sure you REALLY want it. The most obvious thing to do is simply charge for it, and make a little money out of it, but I'm sure the amount of actual money they get from it is pretty minimal compared to their other revenue. <br />
<br />
If you don't like paying for it, don't pay for it. It's not like 10 dollars/euros/etc is really all that expensive, and I'd say it's worth it if you've put that much effort into your guild. And it's not like you're any worse off if you decide not to use it. It's just nice to have the option, y'know?</div></div><hr />

Guildmasters can already do that (by just transferring their own character, obviously). They don't need to transfer guildbank to take everything out of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody up till now charged for such things as guild name change. Every MMO I was in, the game master changed the guild name propmt if you asked nicely. Whenever I asked a GM to change my guilds name I got a reply that this is not possible and is against the rules. Sometimes some people got lucky and the name change was done, assuming the original guild name was offensive or had something else that would suggest a rename. <br />
<br />
However now I will be able to change the guilds name at a price - which is laughable to say the least. If GMs can do it within a second or two (if they see fit), why would they demand money for that. Don't give me Blizzard is a company and want to make money answer, since there's tons of developers/publishers/companies that don't charge for such basic thing except for Blizzard ofc. I was quite quiet up till now with their grossly overpriced services for everything, but I just can't be quiet anymore - this has gone too far in my book. <br />
<br />
And since they are a company, doesn't mean I or we have to swallow everything they present us with smiles on our face, especially if it's so obviously greedy stuff.</div></div><hr />

Thats the point, what is stopping everyone doing it? If my guild decided to get up and leave, there would be no way on earth I would pay to change realms too. <br />
<br />
Think about it from a business move though. 15 quid * 25 players = 375 quid. Im sure people wouldnt batter an eye lid at 15 pounds, but I refuse to pay them any more money. <br />

Stop trying to defend the indefensible. There is a difference between making a profit and being outright greedy. Blizzard has become greedy.<br />
All you people blathering about &quot;a company has to make a profit&quot; need a lesson in morality.<br />
Blizzard is already making hundreds of millions if not billions in profit, when is enough enough?<br />

Since when is Name changing or Server changing ever been free? Your only an idiot if you think that it was going to be free. There's no conspiracies or evil plot behind this. It's common sense. Please remember you don't have to pay for any of these things it's just an Option for those That do. <br />

If you really thought this service would be free, what are you thinking? It's not any different than paying for a server change, only now you're paying a little extra to keep your guild in tact.<br />
<br />
People whining about how a guild leader can abuse this, hello? A guild leader can already take everything from the bank, disband the guild / kick you out of it, and then transfer to another server anyway. How does this service make things any different?</div></div><hr />

Don't think it works like that, you x-fer as the guild leader and your guild comes with you, not the players. They would have to x-fer themselves, and if they did, could retain their guild name and rep in that guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess this means that if your GM wants to move, he will move and take the guild bank with him. Maybe you are not making good enough progress and he wants to try another realm. While giving a GM this power, the small guys like us ..... lose all our guild perks.<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean the outcome would be exactly the same if that GM today did the same thing and looted the bank, scuttled the guild and then x-ferred to a new server on his own?!? Or just booted all the members and stayed on the same server. Or so on...<br />
<br />
D-bag GM's (and players in general) existed before, during and will continue long after WoW has run it's course.</div></div><hr />

You actually need a lesson in morality. A drug company charging ungodly amounts for AIDS meds after there R&amp;D has been paid for 20 times over is immorral. A game company who offers optional services and goods that are in no way required to play the game, or even to play it better than everyone else; a game mind you noone is forced to play. That isnt immoral its amoral. They are a business and a business has a duty to its share holders to profit. I cannot believe that people actually bitch about services that in no way effect game play. So you cant afford a guild transfer that doesnt mean you cant log in and play. The perks of guild rank offer items of convienience and not items that are required to be playable. I have an idea why dont't you stop qqing about something as irrelevant as this and actually focus your energies on something that matters. If you disagree with Blizzard's business model then show them by taking your 15 bucks a month a way. I am sure they will miss it.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure blizzard is just out to ruin the lives of its player base while they slip them poisoned apples and try to cook your kids. <br />
<br />
If these services don't concern you than, LOLYUMAD. As for all the guild leader xfer nonsense, they can already do all the things you are crying about. The can take your perks away and reset your guild rep ( lol kick and ignore ). They can take all the mats and gold from your bank and transfer with it ( lol get gold capped, keep valued items on my 10 26 slot bags, if there's left over gold buy stuff you can AH on new server ). <br />

Even those &quot;free-to-play&quot; MMOs will probably end up costing you money, especially if you want all the things that WoW includes as part of the subscription. Want an extra bag slot beyond the 2 free ones? $5 per month. More than one character slot? No problem, only $15. How about that new raid we just developed that drops all the new BiS gear? We'll unlock it for only $3 per month more. Or you can just give us $50 and we'll mail all that gear to you without you needing to actually complete the content.<br />

Free-to-Play MMOs are still run by companies that are looking to make a profit. The only difference is that instead of charging you up front, through a subscription, they charge a little bit for all the extra features. They are almost like a drug dealer, in that the first taste is free but if you want more it'll be $$. They are basically counting on a certain % of their playerbase being willing to fork over the cash for all the extras so that they turn a profit.<br />

Paying to play their game doesn't give you a right to a fair or balanced or perfect or morale game - it lets you play the game they are producing. <br />
<br />
Guild transfers are a great thing - if a group of people want to transfer with the GL, they don't have to throw away four months of leveling and 25 levels worth of perks. The downside? It makes guilds a commodity - now someone can sell their level X guild, and the buyer can take it wherever they want and change the name to something they like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem is that there is more than 1 way to make profit. 2 example I can thing of, either by trying your best, making it more attractive for customers, but not charging them more, or, trying to take the easy way out, and offering things that doesn't cost you much.<br />
In the last couple of months, I'm seeing more and more changes and announcements that requires less than before.<br />
now, if new items looked like vanilla's ones (way better looking), if models weren't reuse every Tier, if mobs models were actually created more than recolored, THEN I woudn't have this feeling.<br />
But when old successful raids are removed just so that they can put them back in and call it new content, when they make announcements such as this week, saying they want to tune down instant spell dmg and the day after you see them buffing it (so that they can say &quot;yes, that direction wasn't the best, so we'll remove the buffs; what changed in the end? yeah nothing), those are sneaky ways to keep players in, while doing the least amount of work.</div></div><hr />

First, Revenue != Profit. Second, Morality (as has been suggested in a few other posts) is absolutely subjective, especially in the business world. The value of a company is very rarely described as &quot;is it making money?&quot; Rather, it is &quot;Are they making as much money as they could be?&quot; It just boggles me that you think Blizzard's efforts to increase revenues is somehow &quot;evil.&quot; I mean, who loses out in this deal?</div></div><hr />

I have a bank alt guild on a server which I started for myself and my son when he first started playing.<br />
The server is neither in our time zone nor in our part of the country, so our latency can be vicious.<br />
So recently we rerolled on a server that better fits our needs and I would love to bring that guild over so that we have the supplies and mats and whatall we collected on the server that we no longer game on.<br />

I understand the fear that a GM would rip a functioning guild out from under it's members, and yeah, that would stink. But a GM who would do that would eventually screw everyone over anyway - one way or another.</div></div><hr />

It merely opens possibilities for those that are in a situation where this kind of thing would be great. The fee, yes, makes Blizzard some money but imagine there was no cost for this. Guilds would be transferring servers all the time and no body wants that. <br />

<br />
1. Several friends all want to switch realms so they can join the same 'better' guild. They all make a guild on their current server and pool money for a guild transfer instead of paying for individual transfers.<br />
<br />
2. A player has 10 85s on the same server, including a guild bank for their personal use. This will let me move my team of characters around much more freely.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see more details on this.<br />
<br />
If I'm understanding the concept correctly though, the BANK will move, but the characters will remain unless they choose to transfer. I was hoping it would work as you outlined in point 2. I have a crapton of characters (13 above 80) and my credit card gets REALLY pissed at me while I move my entire haul from an old server to a new server. Transferring 20 toons (10 of mine, 10 of my husband's) before the CC company starts calling asking if it's really me (had a woman in the security department who's husband played EverQuest, so she had a good idea of what was going on) gets really old. :(<br />
<br />
I was hoping for an option like &quot;Want to move your guild (characters included)? Here's the fee: (money amount here). Proceed?&quot; Instead I'm spending money to move a bank, and then money to move characters. If anything, would love Blizzard to implement &quot;spend XYZ money in our transfer store, get ABC transfers free...&quot; ;)<br />
<br />
Glad they are rolling something out though...I'll finally be able to reclaim a 6-slot bank on another realm that's been waiting for this functionality for years...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would never happen. If members cannot afford to come, then they can start over but to expect the GM to shell out 200$ vs (im just guessing 30$) would mean the service would never get used. I'm not gonna pay to transfer everyone else. If they don't want to come, why should I have to pay for it anyways? If they want to come, its still only 25$ to server transfer.</div></div><hr />

2. Ofc, this kind of things have to be pay! 1st its a lot information to process and if something go wrong need a GM to fix it. That extra work can cost money. 2nd being paid is like a filter to ppl don't use it &quot;every day&quot; or everyone use it because their server herbs are to expensive or stupid things like that. So is 2 in one. More money and act like a CC.<br />
3. This kind of think was not Blizzard idea. People made A LOT of posts on Beta asking for this because is a lot of work have to tranfer a guild to other server. I remeber ppl telling to blizzard to make special features like GM pay a bit more and choose 25 players to go with guild for free. Also many ppl QQ about this on beta also because the gm power but my 4.<br />
4. GM can allready kick all guild, ninja gold and mats, transfer, or just change the name and create a new one. Nothing change.<br />
5. If you're on one guild for perks don't worry you go guild go away you will find easly other guild with same perks. And for finaly point. If you are on a guild you trust your GM will not ninja guild if you don't trust why are you there?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I would really like to see a guild split option, where some players can branch off of a guild and keep all their perks (except any realm firsts, and bank tabs). If a guild does move servers, one should remain in place on the existing server, with the realm firsts, but no bank tabs. This way any players who don't or can't move still have their guild.<br />
<br />
Oh, and how long until we see a guild faction transfer :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, right? You can seriously tell who here has been weaned on the &quot;customer is always right&quot; idiom. Typical Western Civilization type feeling of complete entitlement. It's as if some of these youngsters think World of Warcraft is an all you can eat buffet - as much as you can handle for just $15 a month and we promise to keep you 100% satisfied forever! What the hell? <br />
<br />
People who are shocked and disgusted place too much importance on their WoW careers. I know that might be a cliche thing to say, but it seems to me that if I properly valued my time in WoW I would be able to make a decision to pay for extra features without much griping. Do I or don't I? Whatever the choice may be, I stand to profit either way. If I don't want the feature, I am not out the cash. If I do, I've got something special I didn't have before (be it an xfer, name change, race change, mount, pet). It's that simple. <br />
<br />
Perhaps this all shows that the general WoW community is of a younger age where things like respect and accountability are still forming. When someone gets gainfully employed and is a bit educated (either by sheer experience or simply college+), they tend to be a bit more pragmatic and have learned to expect things to have a price and to decide which things you need and which you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
And not to mention, guild leaders rarely &quot;out of the blue&quot; do stuff like this. It's largely up to you to have your BS detectors on when you notice something 'off' about one of your guild officers so you can proactively protect yourself from stuff like this. IE, cease donations to the guild bank and poke around for info among the officers if any are willing to talk to you. If you can't bring yourself to trust the officers enough with your stuff, then leave the guild. <br />

<br />
Anyways, people have been requesting the ability to have paid guild transfers for years. If this is something you don't like the idea of using, then by all means don't use the service. And additionally the liklihood of the service causing you any sort of inconvenience is unlikely unless you like to sit around in guilds where you're routinely treated like crap in return for your efforts to contributing to the guild. Wherein that case, what on earth were you expecting to happen?</div></div><hr />

<br />
One way is by turning them into defensive stats. They are defensive stats for Blood death knights, because the DK self-healing is tied into Death Strike, which can miss. It might be possible to do something similar for the other classes. Imagine if Shield Block had to actually hit the target. Presumably you raise your shield, but not high enough to intercept the incoming blow. Now hit becomes a mitigation stat for warriors as well. We might have to adjust the mitigation amount on Shield Block or give warriors a small Hit bonus so Hit capping wasn’t totally unreasonable, but you get the basic idea. You could do the same with paladins (make Holy Shield more interesting?) and druids as well (Savage Defense could proc on a hit).<br />
<br />
No. Just... no.<br />
<br />
Making abilities require stats that they didn't previously is not 'interesting'. It's a nerf. Nerfs are not interesting. Things like Hold the Line are interesting because they add strange and unusual bonuses to a stat you would have been gradually increasing anyways.</div></div><hr />

They would compensate elsewhere. Don't think that Blizzard would nerf them to a point where they are unable to down content, content that they also spent time on developing.<br />
<br />
Having to change the way you play/gear your character slightly != a nerf as it is completely subjective.<br />

People that are lazy and don't want to put in any thought as to how to gear their characters would see this a nerf.<br />

Oh. So your definition of fun is the old WotLK model where we crit, dodge, block, etc, the majority of the time making those stats diminish in value rapidly forcing us to stack 1 stat entirely.

I never join guilds like that but i have know many friends who did. Im not saying it should be free im saying they shouldnt get to transfer the guild unless like half the guild and the gm ok it and those characters are locked into the guild for 5 months or something. A guildie of mine was saying that he had a friend who would armory guilds make a name like the gms, pretend to be them loot the bank sell the items and gold then delete the account. Everytime he would do this he would make 500$. Now imagine a group of 5-8 good raiders transfering servers and changing the guild name building a good rep up and getting lots of people to join then kicking them and selling everything those people got them. A 50$ fee isn't really that important when your making $2-3k a year from the hard work of others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way:<br />
When defensive stats become strong for a given player they have more room to focus on getting hit and expertise capped. I would rather not see gimmicky mechanics that try and force this upon players, the other way this could be handled would be to give certain bosses mechanics that cause a wipe if the tank does not land specific hits. Regardless this would most certainly boil down to making tanking less enjoyable for up and coming tanks who are still in the process of gearing up for heroic 5 mans or raids.</div></div><hr />

I guess this means that if your GM wants to move, he will move and take the guild bank with him. Maybe you are not making good enough progress and he wants to try another realm. While giving a GM this power, the small guys like us ..... lose all our guild perks.<br />

What the fuck kind of guild are you in that you would even worry about that kind of stuff?<br />

If you're in a crap guild where you're worried the GM might take off just don't put anything in the gbank. That way if he ups and leaves you haven't lost anything bar guild rep and that'll be easier to gain in 4.1 so really, who gives a shit?</div></div><hr />

We want to give everyone an early heads-up regarding our plan to implement a guild relocation service for World of Warcraft. The idea is for a guild leader to be able to transfer a guild to another realm. The guild structure remains intact, including the guild leader, guild bank, ranks, and guild name (depending on availability).<br />
<br />
Guild members who decide to relocate with their guild may initiate their own paid character transfer. Upon a successful transfer they will automatically be part of the guild when they first log into the new realm. Their guild rank and guild reputation will be intact.<br />
<br />
Guild leaders who do not want a change of scenery may also choose to pick a new guild name using another new service. These services are in development and we will be providing additional details at a future point in time.<br />
<br />
As with all of the features and services we offer, we intend to incorporate the guild relocation service in a way that will not disrupt the game play experience. Please note that this feature will require extensive internal testing, so you may see bits and pieces of the service appear on the public test realms. We'll announce further details at http://www.WorldofWarcraft.com .<br />

Makes perfect sense. Especially since every server transfer and faction change is fully automated and the work which was put in to implement these functions have surely been paid of years ago.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should be more like the toll services of Norway. When a new bridge is built there are tolls on it. When the build costs are paid off with tolls money the tolls are removed and you are free to drive over the bridge. Alternatively they fee you toll costs for some years(2-5) after the costs are paid for, to collect money for future bridge projects. That's a great system</div></div><hr />

None of the shit Blizzard makes available through their store is game changing. The crap you buy through micro transactions in F2P games makes a massive difference. In terms of actual gameplay you pay a monthly fee and are on equal footing with the billionaire across the sea. That's what you pay the monthly fee for. Good luck being equal to that same guy in a F2P game if he can spend 1000 bucks a month on armor and whatnot and you have a mere 20 bucks spare a month.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't the only company charging for character transfers, renaming of chars, change of appearance etc etc in their MMO. ALL MMO COMPANIES DO IT. DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Previously you could only get a guild transfered with gbank etc intact if there was a free char migration open from your server. And even then it required talking to a GM for it to be done.<br />
<br />
This lets guilds transfer as they please, which is a huge perk if you find yourself on an imbalanced server. The guild I was in before quitting had 1.7 million gold in the gbank at the time. My guess would be that number increased by now. Most of our members were WELL over the gold cap for transfers. Now everyone can chugg their gold in the gbank and transfer all their cash along with just 1 or 2 characters instead of needing 10 char transfers or buying crap on the ah before a transfer.<br />
<br />
If you have a reliable GM this should not be an issue what so ever. If your GM is a tool, then what the hell are you still doing in that guild?<br />

Makes perfect sense. Especially since every server transfer and faction change is fully automated and the work which was put in to implement these functions have surely been paid of years ago.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should be more like the toll services of Norway. When a new bridge is built there are tolls on it. When the build costs are paid off with tolls money the tolls are removed and you are free to drive over the bridge. Alternatively they fee you toll costs for some years(2-5) after the costs are paid for, to collect money for future bridge projects. That's a great system<br />
<br />
This is a company not a public service branch. When Blizzard start collecting your tax money to create these services then you can start drawing such a bogus comparison. (just to clarify, you're forced to pay taxes but not your wow subscription (before you start claiming that your monthly fee is like tax money))<br />
<br />
If you want a good comparison take a sports club. You pay your monthly fee to be a member and get access to the pool, the fitness studio including the aerobic lessons, but if you want a tennis or squash court you have to pay a minimal fee to use them. Basically a reservation fee because you're planning on using something extra, that requires additional maintenance. The same applies to these new services. You can just choose not to play tennis and avoid the additional fees. Or you want to play and deal with the costs. Either way the club will make a profit and keep on existing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't in the business to break even. They're a goddamn company. How thick are you that you would think breaking even should be their goal? If they make a profit they make new games. If they break even they're stuck in a stalemate and no new games would ever come out of that company ever again.</div></div><hr />

A few years back my guild leader just asked a GM and they did it for free, but I don't see anything wrong with charging for a guild transfer. I'd much rather pay a little money to transfer my guild then I would just transfering myself and losing all my guild tabs.</div></div><hr />

The crap you buy through micro transactions in F2P games makes a massive difference. In terms of actual gameplay you pay a monthly fee and are on equal footing with the billionaire across the sea. That's what you pay the monthly fee for. Good luck being equal to that same guy in a F2P game if he can spend 1000 bucks a month on armor and whatnot and you have a mere 20 bucks spare a month.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't the only company charging for character transfers, renaming of chars, change of appearance etc etc in their MMO. ALL MMO COMPANIES DO IT. DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Previously you could only get a guild transfered with gbank etc intact if there was a free char migration open from your server. And even then it required talking to a GM for it to be done.<br />
<br />
This lets guilds transfer as they please, which is a huge perk if you find yourself on an imbalanced server. The guild I was in before quitting had 1.7 million gold in the gbank at the time. My guess would be that number increased by now. Most of our members were WELL over the gold cap for transfers. Now everyone can chugg their gold in the gbank and transfer all their cash along with just 1 or 2 characters instead of needing 10 char transfers or buying crap on the ah before a transfer.<br />
<br />
If you have a reliable GM this should not be an issue what so ever. If your GM is a tool, then what the hell are you still doing in that guild?[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />
.<br />
<br />
i dont have an issue with this since i dont play but what about people that are forced to transfer that way?<br />
<br />
example No1<br />
you go with a guild for years 90% of your wow friends are from that guild...eventually the guild decides to transfer you will follow even thought you dont want to transfer so much<br />
<br />
example No2 <br />
you are in a guild and manage to do sh!tload of things together you make a name for yourself you are somebody in that guild you are one the those guys...and the leaders of the guild decide to transfer you will go with them even if you want it or not because every wow achievement(not the game mechanic)you have is with them and you are actually someone among the sea of anonimity of wow <br />
<br />
example No3<br />
you are a last chancer most of the guilds you have found suck and you find a good guild with good lads and pretty reasonable progress for you it was your last chance as a &quot;faction name&quot;it was that guild or change faction since you know the server and they decide to transfer you will go with them because you found a place to enjoy the game<br />
<br />
in all of the above examples the GM and officers aren't mentioned as bad people or good ones they just took a decision that decision will cost you and 80% random$ thats why i think is not something good but then again i dont count since i dont play anymore and my examples are healthy examples of a vast number of wow players into that i dont give example of people that just want a guild and will stick to the 1st decent they find no matter what change they do...or people that care for loot and are on a guild that deliver what they want....it forces you to pay and the argument of you dont have to pay is not valid cause the pressure from your guild mates/wow friends will be a big factor for you and most people think hey its 25$(thats a random number btw)<br />
as for the F2P and P2P at least in F2P you know what you are doing in what blizzard does is treating you like a 12 year boy that will chew what ever it gives you and hope that people that are grown ups and dont actually care about the given amount of money will back it up...iam one of those if i was in a good guild hell 25 or 30$ would be a lot of money to give for that guild every now or then <br />
<br />
again to clarify myself i dont bitch about this i just think its the first bad micro transaction that blizzard will put in the game and in Greece we have a saying which ill roughly translate :P <br />

You do realise that all 3 of your examples already occur right now, yeh? This new service will not make any difference. The only thing this service offers is the option to take your guild with you (not the people in it) without having to empty the guild bank and spread it across characters in preperation of a transfer. The way I understand it, all members including the GM will still have to pay for a seperate character transfer.</div></div><hr />

Oh my bad, thought it was required. Oh wait it is required, the server transfers, name changes and in-game items are in fact core mechanics that change gameplay. Twist it how you will but it's still true. These services should be included for the price of our monthly fee. It's hardly justified by Blizzard, but there is nothing we can do about it other than complain.</div></div><hr />

Mounts and pets don't change gameplay. Not a single MMO offers name/faction/realm changes for free. Those are not micro-transactions.<br />
<br />
You don't have to name change you can just reroll. You don't have to take your current character to another realm, you can just level a new one. You don't have to transfer your guild, you can just create a new one.<br />
<br />
They don't have to offer any of those services. Be glad they do.<br />

15$ a month is no 'hefty fee'. I pay 50 bucks a month for my gym (it's a very nice gym). I buy a newspaper every morning for 1.50 bucks. And I get much less enjoyment out of that newspaper than I do out of a game.</div></div><hr />

I believe this will be a great service. We transferred our main toons from a PVE server to a PVP server to raid with some RL friends during the last couple months of WotLK. Both toons are Day 1 toons having well over 500 days played on each toon. Since the release of Cata we have seen a dramatic drop in membership due to the lack of raid progression. I will not get into the reasons for that because they have been dragged through the mud on so many other threads it would be pointless to bring them up here. With the release of Rift we lost the three main officers and the GM. They turned the guild over to my and I would love to be able to transfer the guild, including bank, rep, and rewards to a PVE server. I would love to not loose another guild bank, this one with 7 tabs, to a server change as we already have 2 guilds with 6 tab banks on servers we no longer enjoy playing on.<br />

For the most part (from a feral tank perspective) I avoid hit and expertise like the plague because it offers very little to no advantages for me. <br />
<br />
I currently run 10mans in which I am VERY constantly asked to kick for our runs to be successful. I love that, I love not only having to cycle cooldowns and maintain threat/make raid calls and positioning adjustments, but be able to go from a 'good tank' to a 'great tank'. The misses on kicks in P2 Nefarian make me hate that, but with the upcoming fix to interrupts that should be taken care of.<br />
<br />
My concern is the additional stat stacking that tanks already have too much of. As a feral we need a lot of stam, agil, dodge, mastery. That is 4 stats to stack (not mentioning armor because its tier capped anyways). On my lock, I only need hit, haste and int. Yea parts of crit/mastery can help, but they are not essential. If you make hit/expertise necessary for tanks (again just from a feral standpoint) we will need to have 6 different stats to stack. namely stam (more hps and higher vengeance stack for more self heals and SD procs), agil (dodge, and higher vengeance stack), crit(SD procs only on crit), mastery(higher SD cap) expertise and hit. <br />
<br />
To me 6 stats is a little far fetched for most tanks that play this game... I already see the average tank as sub par due to the LFG tool and having to deal with slow/bad tanks. Let alone requiring them to learn how to gem/gear correctly. It will be a designer nightmare that in my opinion would be better left alone</div></div><hr />

Technically the mount (soon to be mounts) do affect game play not significantly perhaps but they still do it. Consider the fact that by purchasing this mount you now have a mount on every character that works for every level of mount. This means you will save the gold for every level of mount that you would other wise buy. It's not a huge amount of gold, especially after the mount changes that made only your riding skill effect speed, but still it does effect game play to some slight degree.<br />
<br />
Any way the problem with more &quot;services&quot; of this kind is as mentioned previously that it is a pay to play mmo not a free to play one, this is essentially becoming pay to play and micro transaction bullshit on top of that. Not to mention that it's extremely poor value for money. Say I want to transfer my Horde character to play with my friends who are playing alliance on another server, well thats 20 euro for server chance and another 30 for faction change totaling 50 euro, I can get a brand new spanking game for that money and thats just to start playing, then I have to pay for subscription fees on top of that.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />
