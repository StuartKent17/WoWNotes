Five Player Blast Furnace Normal<br />
If Challenge Modes aren't challenging enough for you, you can always try and run raids with five players! Kief (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/frostmane/Kief/advanced) and friends managed to kill Blast Furnace normal and are getting close (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/30p56c/5_players_vs_blast_furnace_normal_just_because_we/cpuisk5) to killing Blackhand with an item level of 695.<br />

<br />
Armory Stats - Challenge Modes<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Challenge Mode achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 6.1 million characters from 3.1 million accounts. We also did this for the end of Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4584-Armory-Stats-MoP-Challenge-Modes-Blue-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month-DLC-469). <br />
<br />
The first chart looks at the overall percentage of players that have each challenge mode achievement. The second chart defines a participating player as one with the completion achievement for that challenge mode. <br />
<br />
You can click the titles in the legend to turn off and on different data types.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor introduced challenge mode weapons for transmog, rather than the armor sets offered during Mists of Pandaria (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/932-Challenge-Mode-Armor-Sets). The challenge modes also offer gear (www.wowdb.com/items/119032-challengers-strongbox#related:contains-item;_!) (item level 660 (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119010-doomchain-collar?bonusIDs=237,591) as of Patch 6.1.) from the daily quests (www.wowdb.com/items/119032-challengers-strongbox#related:reward-of-quest;_!), unlike the Mists of Pandaria quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Challenge Warlord (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8895-challenge-warlord) - 1.23% of players<br />
Challenge Warlord: Bronze (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8897-challenge-warlord-bronze) - 1.02% of players / 83.15% of participating players<br />
Challenge Warlord: Silver (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8898-challenge-warlord-silver) - 0.86% of players / 70.16% of participating players<br />
Challenge Warlord: Gold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8899-challenge-warlord-gold) - 0.63% of players / 51.32% of participating players<br />

Since heirlooms have a tab now, can it be possible to delete a character without having to delete the heirlooms too beforehand<br />
Thank you for the feedback. We'll look into it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/580767892095922176))<br />

The vast majority of people running around in Mythic pieces today have a solid idea, while Heroic have an idea. Anything below is just tuning for casual players that decided to try something besides LFR. I've heavily disagreed with this segmentation of the playerbase since they put it into effect officially with TOC, while experimenting with it in Ulduar. Easy&gt;Normal&gt;Hard&gt;Expert is all the 4 levels come down to, they have never tuned it around anything other than the gear people are wearing, rather than tuning it around player skill and aptitude. If it was tuned around those 2 things, we wouldn't see ilvl being a big deal. Even the guilds I pal around with in the US Top 20 still regard ilvl as being important.</div></div><hr />

The caster weapons are just underwhelming. Sword looks cool though. There were posters here claiming 2k dollars a month from MoP boosting, which attests to the demand those sets had</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're actually really easy to read... There's a legend of what each color means, there's a side that states what percentage of players have done, and there are bars for each instance.<br />
<br />
What's so hard to read here? Also, you do know that Blizzard isn't the one doing the graphs, right? <br />
<br />
Oh, and they're good graphs that tell a story and has very useful information. Just because you don't think so doesn't make it suddenly irrelevant data.</div></div><hr />

Rewarding players for the 'Go As fast As You Can' mentality was never something that I thought was a good idea, and given the subjective rewards of a mount and cosmetic gear, I'm not surprised at the numbers. I honestly think they need to rethink harder level 5 mans and just stream-line the system and bring them in line with raids. Just have Mythic 5 mans for people (like myself) who for one reason and another, don't have time or inclination to raid but would like a meaningful progression path offering comparable (but not as strong) raid gear. Actually, given the guys that 5 manned Furnace, isn't it about time we got 5 man (and scaling? What happened to the 6 man idea to push more DPS players through the LFG queue?) raids anyway? Would save the art and environment team a lot of work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the number of players we have come across so far, with it slowly increasing over time as we find more players. We don't track any of Asia, where more than half of subscribers are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm not mistaken, the 10 million figure includes East + West subs. I'm not sure if that means these 3.1 million accounts in the West all have a level 100, but that could be not too far from the actual figures [but it's a sample so probably not] That'd also effectively weed out the bot subs since they usually are level 90 or less. There could be plenty of active characters that don't show up for whatever reason. I know armory was bugged for a lot of people a couple of months ago on my some servers. With that said, I know nothing on the topic, other than to say Blizzard quotes east+west<br />
<br />
<br />
can't blame MMOC for having 'boring' WoW news when there's just nothing coming from Blizz to report on<br />

Everyone has a point. That doesn't mean it's a good point, that he is correct, or that the point is worth making.<br />
<br />
I've already answered at least 5 &quot;there's no content&quot; posts. I'll sum up my answer once more:<br />
&quot;There is content if you want to play that content. Content that you don't like != no content. Otherwise, WoW is a pretty sandbox-ish game if your imagination isn't limited and if you play it as an mMo, with capital M. Boring people get bored easily. Go work on that.&quot;<br />

There's really not enough people who actually completed current HC, and especially Mythic. Even BRF was introduced too soon after HM. There's some graphs on that topic in recent MMOc news I think. No one wants another SoO/ICC era but new raid every 1-3 months? Geez, it takes time to progress you know?</div></div><hr />

Yes, and 20% of the people making gold progress implies 20% having succeeded in silver, versus the average of 2%. The question is are people on this forum that much above the average or are there just a LOT of liars. And then there's the &quot;industrial engineer&quot; who can't read a standard bar graph, and who's punctuation and capitalization is... different... than any professional engineer I've ever met.

Fast forward to WoD and it's just a carbon copy of the old system, only this time the rewards are definitely more hit and miss, making it not worth the effort for most people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the graph is easy to ready - but its kinda weak graphical representation/interpetation of what it is represented - if your resoults are are oscilating around 1 % or few % and bars are pretty big in sense that 2 axis are really far away from one to another numebrs there should be some description under the graph to describe it clearly to anyone reading the graph - but there is none - the graphs are made this way to pretend that those 1-5% of chalenge mode/mythic raids are more significant then they really are which is a % close to this of statistical error from normal distribution.<br />
<br />
if they wanted to be honest they would put description of : &quot; this is purposedly made to appear bigger so that you could read cuause in reality graph showing resoult of 1 % would be not readable cause it would look liek this&quot; and there should be another graph right next to it which woudl show this 1 % as barely visible line on graph which woudl be better graphic interpretation.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't until later when they announced their removal (and the dungeons were effectively nerfed by class buffs and gem sockets) that a large portion of people started running them.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see what happens with WoD CMs once we have a clearer idea of when the next expansion is coming.<br />
<br />
In addition to the lackluster rewards this time around, I think a contributing disincentive to doing WoD CMs is how much longer the dungeons are compared to the MoP ones. In MoP, most gold times were in the 12-15 minute range. In WoD, there is only ONE dungeon under 15 minutes, with most in the 17-20 minute range, and UBRS capping out at 25. Five to ten extra minutes may not seem like much, but when you are repeatedly running these dungeons to learn them it really starts to add up. My CM team is finishing our last gold with UBRS, and we can only get about 3 good attempts in our allotted time each night after you subtract time for early resets. Asking players to stay focused and uninterrupted for 25 straight minutes is bordering on extreme, in my opinion. That's almost the time it takes to get the PG Endless titles. There's a reason that raid bosses don't take this long to kill.</div></div><hr />

Ok so we have 3.1 million subs, just for an example we split that up for EU and US and that's 1.55 million per region. Since EU and US can't play together and the 7 million people in the east using time cards can't play with us. We only ever play with one and a half million people. So when other mmos say they have 1 million, kind of puts things into perspective. Saying there are 10 million people playing but you only play with 1.5 of them is VERY misleading.</div></div><hr />

Exactly! I was really surprised when I saw a lvl. 100 char with 250+ k hp<br />
<br />
It looks as if stat squish never ever happened. <br />
<br />
On the other way stat rise from lvl. 90 to lvl. 100 is just abnormally (should I say retardedly) enormous. <br />
<br />
What exactly was the point of stat squish if tanks are already at 500k hp, exactly the same as in MoP?<br />
<br />
I actually though that Blizz devs would actually flatten iLevel formula for entire game (iL-120 at lv 90) not leave the old iLevel formula in effect (iL-450+ at lvl 90) . What where they thinking anyway? <br />
<br />

In the expansion when stat squish happened yet characters are already at nearly the same hp levels as in the last one (MoP)!!!<br />

Who is being misled? What is your point? Do you think you can discern more than 10,000 individuals in any group? What would you notice at 3 million that wouldnt be there in a group of 30,000 or 300,000?<br />
<br />
One obvious difference in the games would be the revenue 10 million generate vs. 1 milion. Its the main reason content generation should be noticeably faster.. All regions drink from the same creative well with minor variations.</div></div><hr />
