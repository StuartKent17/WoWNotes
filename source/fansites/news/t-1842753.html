It is confirmed you'll get 1 free level 100 when Legion launches. It was even quite clear before they announced that. It's definitively something they'll continue doing in the next expacs.<br />

Bigger questions is, what are CHARACTER_UPGRADE_100_TOKEN ? Looks as if these could be made available to sell on the auction house for gold</div></div><hr />

LOL, just to inform you, most of the things done in today's gaming have been already done by someone, so you can't really start yelling everywhere that blizzard stole a feature from another game, when that game wasn't the first to introduce it anyway, they way you're putting things it's ignorant.</div></div><hr />

There are mechanics like this in most games, you can grind your way in if you want the item immediately, or wait months/years until the gating is gone since not enough players do that anymore. The choice is yours, you can show your shiny mount when only a few have, or wait until it becomes mainstream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're the type of person who only thinks about the finish and not the journey...? Gotcha.<br />
<br />
No, you don't HAVE to farm that &quot;garbage&quot; if you indeed feel that it IS garbage. Subjective.<br />
<br />
Catch-up mechanics are a thing in WoW since a loooong time back, that's why there's also more prestigious rewards that you cannot obtain later on. If they followed YOUR logic, we wouldn't have expansion content to do from TBC, WOTLK, Cataclysm, MoP since it would've been removed to not hurt the special snowflake-needs of some people. You either play when it's current and have the stuff before everyone else, or you wait until it's been long outdated. <br />
<br />
Addressing the toxic community would also mean addressing people such as yourself. Your post isn't exactly a beacon of inspiration and fun.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think Blizzard is stupid for adding yet another store mount. It pisses everyone off and the quality of the mounts are always better than anything you can get in the game. Its just a slap in the face at this point. You'd think after losing 5 million customers they'd learn a thing or two.

Just goes to show that Warcraft still matters to Blizz even though people think it doesn't. Does this mean Diablo 3X2 isnt being announced at Bcon2015? Id have thought that would be the murlock if it were. Or WoW matters more to them further proving my point.</div></div><hr />

The mount looks slick. I do want it for my characters, but I'm not getting suckered (my opinion) into buying more items from the store. They have the resources to add these things to the game in fun and unique ways and have chosen not to in order to bring in more immediate cash. Their choice and they've made it clear they're sticking with that plan, but it's added to other reasons to make my burnout quicker each time I resub.</div></div><hr />

Step 1: Add stuff to PTR that appears to supplement ingame events with more rewards.<br />

Step 3: Claim you thought it was a good idea to get these rewards in now rather than wait until the week/month they were relevant.<br />
Step 4: If someone asks why don't you just push the flagged features, claim the legion strings have somehow messed up their implementation and they need to be fixed but don't worry you'll get a bunch of stuff when it goes live.<br />
Step 5: Show no major changes on the PTR till Blizzcon whilst citing that stuff still needs fixing and that the new hallows end stuff won't be available this year and simultaneously planning how to further delay the features.<br />
Step 6: Put Legion on Beta servers and suggest that the expansion will taking all you attention from the PTR so no more changes there.<br />

When you say &quot;weeks&quot; you mean 1~3(4 is a month, more than that and it's months). Otherwise they could have said &quot;seconds&quot; and it would still be fine. It's just blizz being assholes like they are used to now.<br />

Yay, that will make the legendary quest line really a lot of fun again! .. NOT. This doesn't really seem very fair. 20k Apexis is really a lot and 75 runes is only 1/12 of the quest requirement - and there are 3 other quests you need to do.<br />

I really hope they stop with these boring grinds in legion. I'd like to enjoy the story of an expansion, but these &quot;farm exactly 1238712789012470981 of X&quot; quests really make it hard.

It's not, it's a bit less than 3 days of Tanaan dailies. It's a lot compared to the old apexis acquisition rate, true, but not to the current. Of course, that requires you to spend one hour or more every day with that specific alt. But, eh, any bonus is a bonus.<br />

It's a lot compared to the old apexis acquisition rate, true, but not to the current. Of course, that requires you to spend one hour or more every day with that specific alt. But, eh, any bonus is a bonus.<br />
<br />
Or, you know, you can wait. It's not as if the expansion comes this fall, right?<br />
<br />
Well 3 days of dailies for 1/12 of the progress on elemental runes, theoretically that means 36 days of tanaan dailies for all the elemental runes you need for the quest. excluding the runes you get from lfr or garrison - but still that doesn't seem fair. besides there are much nicer things you can use apexis for than elemental runes, i.e. gear and the mount.</div></div><hr />

Then be a reasonable human being and make a choice based on your priorities. This is just ONE source to get them from. So your &quot;36days&quot; is irrelevant. They aren't meant to exclusively provide all the items. Just be an option to alleviate and speed up the collection for alts and others.</div></div><hr />

What? You do your 4 Tanaan dailies, send out your followers and ships, get your weekly tanaan apexis bonus in...and maybe build the portal building. That nets you like 10k apexis every single day(and since those catch up things are weeklys anyway, you got plenty apexis left over for other things)...and you are doing most of that anyway for reputation reasons. I made like 400k apexis since 6.2 went live...and I never farmed.</div></div><hr />

Grow the fuck up, on an alt you will be doing the dailies anyway, the rate you get these items is already high just from ship missions so they added these as a bonus, my god you're so entitled, you think they should just let everyone start on the final stage of the ring?</div></div><hr />

Names are one thing but once pics start showing up my excitement grows too much. That moose is GLORIOUS, and so is the Murkidan pet. <br />
And so GLAD that they're adding currency to Timewalking, gives me an incentive to actually run the dungeons since an extra seal per week just didn't feel like it was worth it to me. Mounts tho? I'm THERE! <br />

So you're the type of person who only thinks about the finish and not the journey...? Gotcha.<br />
<br />
No, you don't HAVE to farm that &quot;garbage&quot; if you indeed feel that it IS garbage. Subjective.<br />
<br />
Catch-up mechanics are a thing in WoW since a loooong time back, that's why there's also more prestigious rewards that you cannot obtain later on. If they followed YOUR logic, we wouldn't have expansion content to do from TBC, WOTLK, Cataclysm, MoP since it would've been removed to not hurt the special snowflake-needs of some people. You either play when it's current and have the stuff before everyone else, or you wait until it's been long outdated. <br />
<br />
Addressing the toxic community would also mean addressing people such as yourself. Your post isn't exactly a beacon of inspiration and fun.<br />
<br />
People like you seem confused. A &quot;toxic community&quot; is when players shit on other players for their opinions and the way they play (what you are doing). I'm criticizing a corporation for their shitty ideas, as you defend the shitty ideas with a white knight shield and shit all over your fellow players. And I'm the problem. Lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll ll<br />

Also, to the people harping about flying, I believe the original message said &quot;weeks NOT months&quot;, that second part being the actual important one. That technically gives them eight (8) weeks, since until then it's less than two (2) and still month (singular) and &quot;NOT months&quot; (plural).

All characters will need to reach Revered reputation with three Tanaan Jungle factions, including the Saberstalkers and the Order of the Awakened. Alliance players will need to curry the favor of the Hand of the Prophet, while the Horde will need to earn the trust of Vol'jin's Headhunters. <br />

This was already a thing, and I don't think they mean &quot;alts&quot; when they say &quot;all characters&quot;. I think they mean &quot;Horde and Alliance, but Horde have to do this, while Alliance have to do this&quot;.<br />

I know you need it for Pathfinder on one character but why said in such a way. It would be better to say/write &quot; if your character has &quot; Revered reputation with three Tanaan Jungle factions, including the Saberstalkers and the Order of the Awakened. Alliance players will need to curry the favor of the Hand of the Prophet, while the Horde will need to earn the trust of Vol'jin's Headhunters. &quot; all you other characters would have it as well.<br />

They give us another option to get the epic faster and yet you still complain ? if you don't like to farm Apexis nobody force you to , just get your ring like everyone else did by Raiding . Oh wait you mean Blizzard should just give you the ring without any work ... I get it.<br />

I'm laughing that this minor patch has more content than 6.1 already.<br />
<br />
I would'nt hang your hat on any possible anniversary stuff, that could come any time in the next week or two. No, I don't think they're releasing it next week. Neth's language is the kind they use when it's a couple weeks out. <br />
<br />
Look at it this way - they said they renamed (delayed) this, to include Legion build up stuff. So they're setting the stage for 7.0. If they were going to do another sizable patch after this, say 6.2.3, to set the stage for 7.0 more, why not wait until then, and not delay the flying update?<br />
<br />
Nope. This is the last substantial patch until 7.0, and it'll be a couple weeks before you get it. <br />
<br />
The first holiday of substance between now and 7.0 is what, Brewfest? It'll ship between now and Brewfest. Sometime in the next 6 weeks. <br />

FF14 let you send out your retainers (follower/Auctioneer) on missions in a similar way. Leveling is similar, but you'd outfit them in level appropriate gear in individual slots.

I'm not a fan of the fact is a reskin of mounts from last expansion, but I do really like it. I'll never have it though, never been much of a mount collector. <br />

First of all, there's no rule grammatical or otherwise that says you can't, and second there's no need to hurl insults. As far as I'm concerned that loses you the argument straight away--not that there was one since you are patently wrong to begin with. Have a nice life!</div></div><hr />

There is no grammatical rule to not say &quot;seconds&quot; when you mean &quot;next year&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of &quot;otherwise&quot; rules, though. Like, you know, logical ones. If you answer to an &quot;how long&quot; question with some time measurement people expect quite reasonably that it is the maximum expected timespan. I.e. you do not use &quot;minutes&quot; when you need 5 hours.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it is a non-answer. You could use &quot;seconds&quot; to every timespan over 1 second, be it 5 seconds or 500 years. You are willfully obtuse if you cannot see this.<br />
<br />
Also, as a sidenote, saying you have &quot;your head in your ass&quot; is not really an insult. &quot;Existence of words which can be used as insults in sentence != &quot;sentence is an insult&quot;. Did he call you an ass? Nope. He just said you have your head in your ass, aka you are not listening/thinking. It in no way different than saying that you have your head in the sand.</div></div><hr />

It's basic common sense, which you lack.</div></div><hr />

I do too, but I have somewhat of an issue with them continuing to award flying mounts for achievements if flying isn't supported in current content. Not that I won't spend the gold on a subscription to earn the thing...<br />

The only reason to use a smaller unit of measurement when describing something is if 1) it doesn't meet the requirement of the next unit of measurement up(in this case months) or 2) you're trying to be deceptive. If Blizz knew they weren't going to have flying in the game until at least the week after Blizzcon then weeks is appropriate for their primary announcement. If they knew they wouldn't be testing the actual final patch until then then they were being deceptive. In this case the later feels more true than the former. Blizzard will blame it on poor communication.</div></div><hr />
