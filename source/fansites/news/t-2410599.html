<br />
this is not even remotely close to a sign that the pre-patch is not coming next week. The fact that the 17th is 4 weeks til bfa launch is however a 99.8% sign that the patch IS coming next week.</div></div><hr />

They should let people know sooner than later though, there are things hinged on when it hits and whether someone will make more time available personally for things like Mage Tower and some achievements, also I don't want to hear this &quot;you had a year to do it&quot; crap that is just an elitist load of QQ and it makes people who say that sound stupid considering the weapons are getting more powerful making it easier right up until patch hits, which makes it easier to do closer to said date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, if you were worried about getting them in the past year or so, why wouldn't you have been trying to work toward them in that time? Trying to crunch it into the last few days of the patch seems silly, and leaves you too open to missing out.<br />
<br />
Also, there's plenty of evidence that points towards it releasing next reset. Nothing official, admittedly, but still a lot of evidence that we've had for quite a while now. Waiting even longer, and cutting down on available time you have, before doing the challenges simply because there isnt anything concrete is just showing poor time management skills on your part.</div></div><hr />

It's probably wisest to assume that it'll be next week and get as much done as you can so you're not blindsided, then you can be surprised and glad that you had more time after all and potentially chase more skins. For example, I wasn't completely sure it wouldn't drop yesterday, so on monday night I got my field medic achieve done and WW monk challenge. Now that there's another week I'm gonna try for brewmaster and try and have that done by next Tuesday.<br />
<br />
If you're wrong about when it drops, the stakes are high. Plus with a lot of the fights you have to learn mechanics too and its not just about brute force. Why have the worry of a couple of days deadline on top of that? GL on your challenges--its worth the effort I love seeing my toons with them.</div></div><hr />

Well I wish you could too, since BETA is not a DEMO. Meaning that if you have a different opinion about the talent tree you mentioned, you as a BETA TESTER have the ability to report and discuss such matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You misunderstood. I wasn't mad or disappointed. I was curious how the new talent tree looks like. I never logged back in, because it was 2 months to BfA then and why would I want to do anything on the PTR I'd have to redo in a short while. Not to mention I hate spoilers. I wish I could give it away to someone who would make more use of it.</div></div><hr />

Well, the last phase of testing is usually when they do stress tests, &quot;play with the blues&quot; events, and potentially other random fun community/dev interactions like spawning bosses in cities and whatnot. Not sure how much they do that these days, though, as I usually uninstall the beta around prepatch.</div></div><hr />
