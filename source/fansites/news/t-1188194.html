Well while I am sad that they changed it, I am glad it wasn't after it was put on live and had to adjust with them taking it away.<br />
<br />
With HR on a 30 sec cooldown and double time / Juggernaut PVP mobility is just fine, add to that Avatar and Bladestorm I think it will be just fine. As for the stun reduction on DR, meh, the damage wasn't changed so I can live with it as well. Shockwave is still the superior talent regardless unless you want some lulz.</div></div><hr />

I bet they were testing some raids, the Blizz team lock out skilled GC and he sent him to serve coffees and started a set of nerfs to make sure an unskilled mage will always out dps a skilled lock.<br />
I'm fine with locks overburden rotation and cd's/procs controls, but keeping those and still let us under perform damage wise is just nonsense (demo and destro, since aff seems to be ok if u play flawlessly, which locks always need to do if they don't want to hug the bench).</div></div><hr />

After 1 wipe we were able to kill him though (had the 2 mounts dropped, rolled 97 for the Life-Binder's Handmaiden, got beaten but a guildy with a 100! I was shocked!).</div></div><hr />

Level 90 scaling not level 85 scaling. Most of the balancing is due to certain abilities scaling better than others at 90 in epic gear. Until everyone is in epic gear in pandaria they cant really fully gauge what needs buffs but they are trying there best for now.</div></div><hr />

The amount of abilities on GCD now is just silly. They give us more abilities to use now making the class clunky to play. And before someone goes into omg hunters were so easy to play l2p.. the class is to 'clunky' to play which makes it difficult to use effectivley.<br />
The fact abilities are aren't even usable on some fights, they make BM the top spec to use but you have fights where its main dps spell 'kill command' isn't even usable. Yes new patch will have lots of issues but seriously people are getting tired to fuck of the never ending bugs that take so long to resolve. It feels like I'm playing a permanent beta realm.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if they released something that was fully playable for a change, tired of the excuses and sympatisers. <br />
<br />
Also Nerfing pets hard, I tried to solo the usual raids like voa, TK etc.. my pet has never died so much. One of the few things I found remotely enjoyable, even with flasks, correct spec/glyphs/tank pet and even trying to resort to 2 x T5 (haven't needed that in ages) still taking tons of dmg and dying in most cases.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting for the 'MOP' will fix all of the things.. just like cata would etc etc <br />
<br />
Also I wish people would stop using the shitty responce of 'no ones forcing you to play. you can always quit, l2p. QQmoar' ... if you haven't the brain power to argue your point or discuss something don't try take away from peoples concerns over the game/class/etc</div></div><hr />

The chain lightning change for example nerfed the initial damage by 17.5% but increased the damage that jumps each time, resulting in what should be the same damage done but more spread out among all targets. There was also a bug fix to frost's mastery that buffed dps so they needed to take dps from somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that they cant be macroed into your Cobra Shot or Steady Shot etc... people would macro hawk to instants and fox to casts. At least the bads used to do this... so Blizz apparently thought it was game breaking that bad hunters macroed stances so they nerfed it.<br />
So now bad will be horrid.<br />
<br />
Not sure why they felt the need to not only do this once before with a 1.5 sec GCD then leave it out, then bring it back now with a 1 second... <br />
Guess our Overlord Magus GhostilovemagesmostestofallCrawler thought that the sims with all 3 hunter specs in the bottom 5 for T14 wasn't enough and he wanted them as the bottom 3 with no question they would ever move up by adding this AND nerfing BM...</div></div><hr />

That's... pointless and stupid. Might as well not be there. 3 seconds was already abysmally short. If they really want to address the problem of &quot;Dragon's Roar being the favorite talent for that tier&quot; because it's instant DPS for PvEing and I'd say it even surpasses the others for PvP functionality, then they should address the damage, the armor bypass or guaranteed crit which makes it so appealing, or better yet, buff up the other talents in that row to be just as competitive. Not just... we're going to kneejerk nerf and not touch anything else.</div></div><hr />
