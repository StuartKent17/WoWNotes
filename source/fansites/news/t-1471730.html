<br />
Last week, we talked about squishing stats and pruning unnecessary complexity as part of our ongoing design goals for World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor. This time, we'll look at a few topics all related to one vital element: health.<br />
<br />
Player Health and Resilience<br />
In the next expansion, we’re planning several interconnected changes designed to provide better-tuned gameplay for healers and improve the healing dynamic in PvP.<br />
<br />
The high amount of base Resilience and Battle Fatigue in Mists of Pandaria currently causes characters to feel much weaker in PvP than they do in PvE. To address this disparity, we’re approaching Warlords of Draenor with the goal of shrinking that gap as much as possible. To reduce dependence on Resilience, we needed to increase player survivability against other players, and we chose to do this by essentially doubling (post-squish) player health.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/healthygameplay2.jpg<br />
<br />
On its own, that increase in health would make players more survivable in the world at large, so we’re also increasing creature damage and the effectiveness of healing spells to balance things out. The net result of these changes is that individual attacks will knock a smaller chunk off of a player’s health pool in PvP, but your survivability in PvE won’t be affected.<br />
<br />
Doubling player health gave us room to reduce Resilience and Battle Fatigue, but our goal was to be able to remove them entirely. In order to achieve that, we’re also reducing PvP spike damage across the board by lowering Critical Damage and Critical Heals to 150% of their normal effect (down from 200%).<br />
<br />
Our hope is that these changes allow us to reduce Base Resilience and Battle Fatigue to 0%. It’s possible that we’ll still find a need for some minor amount of Base Resilience and/or Battle Fatigue, and we’ll be testing these changes extensively and adjusting as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Retuning Healing Spells<br />
<br />
One of our goals for healing in Warlords of Draenor is to tone down the raw throughput of healers relative to the size of player health pools. Currently, as healers and their allies acquire better and better gear, the percentage of a player’s health that any given heal restores increases significantly. As a result, healers are able to refill health bars so fast that we have to make damage more and more “bursty” in order to challenge them. Ideally, we want players to spend some time below full health without having healers feel like the players they’re responsible for are in danger of dying at any moment. We also think that healer gameplay would be more varied, interesting, and skillful if your allies spent more time between 0% and 100%, rather than just getting damaged quickly to low health, forcing the healer to then scramble to get them back to 100% as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/healthygameplay3.jpg<br />
<br />
To that end, we’re buffing heals less than we’re increasing creature damage. Heals will be deliberately less potent compared to health pools than before the item squish. Additionally, as gear improves, the scaling rates of health and healing will now be very similar, so the relative power of any given healing spell shouldn’t climb so much over the course of this expansion. For those concerned about what this means for raiding, don’t worry—we’re taking all of these changes into account when designing Raid content for Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
It’s also important to note that spells that heal based on a percentage of maximum health are being effectively buffed by the massive increase to player health pools, so we’re lowering those percentages to offset the effect. That may make them appear to have been nerfed—however, the net result is that those percentage-based heals stay about the same as before relative to other heals.<br />
<br />
All of these changes apply to damage-absorption shields as well. Additionally, we're toning down the power of absorbs in general. When they get too strong, absorption effects are often used in place of direct healing instead of as a way to supplement it. We will, of course, take these changes into account when tuning specializations that rely heavily on absorbs, such as Discipline Priests.<br />
<br />
We also took a look at healing spells that were passive or auto-targeted (so-called &quot;smart&quot; heals).<br />
<br />
We want healers to care about who they're targeting and which heals they're using, because that makes healer gameplay more interactive and fun. To that end, we're reducing the healing of many passive and auto-targeted heals, and making smart heals a little less smart. Smart heals will now randomly pick any injured target within range instead of always picking the most injured target. Priority will still be given to players over pets, of course.<br />
<br />
Another of our goals for healing in this expansion is to strike a better balance between single-target and multi-target healing spells. We've taken a close look at the mana efficiency of our multi-target heals, and in many cases, we're reducing their efficiency, usually by reducing the amount they heal. Sometimes, but more rarely, raising their mana cost was a better decision. We want players to use multi-target heals, but they should only be better than their single-target equivalents when they heal more than two players without any overhealing. This way, players will face an interesting choice between whether to use a single-target heal or a multi-target heal based on the situation.<br />
<br />
Finally, we're removing the low-throughput, low-mana-cost heals like Nourish, Holy Light, Heal, and Healing Wave, because we think that while they do add complexity, they don’t truly add depth to healing gameplay. (We’re also renaming some spells to re-use those names. For example, Greater Healing Wave is being redubbed Healing Wave.) However, we still want healers to think about their mana when deciding which heal to cast, and so the mana costs and throughputs of many spells are being altered to give players a choice between spells with lower throughput and lower cost versus spells with higher throughput and higher costs. Here are some examples from each healer class:<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/healthygameplay4.jpg<br />
<br />
Druid Higher Efficiency: Healing Touch, Rejuvenation, Efflorescence<br />
Druid Higher Throughput: Regrowth, Wild Growth<br />
<br />
Monk Higher Efficiency: Soothing Mist, Renewing Mist<br />
Monk Higher Throughput: Surging Mist, Spinning Crane Kick<br />
<br />
Paladin Higher Efficiency: Holy Light, Holy Shock, Word of Glory, Light of Dawn<br />
Paladin Higher Throughput: Flash of Light, Holy Radiance<br />
<br />
Priest Higher Efficiency: Greater Heal, Circle of Healing, Prayer of Mending, Holy Nova (new Discipline-only version), Penance<br />
Priest Higher Throughput: Flash Heal, Prayer of Healing<br />
<br />
Shaman Higher Efficiency: Healing Wave, Riptide, Healing Rain<br />
Shaman Higher Throughput: Healing Surge, Chain Heal<br />
<br />
All of this discussion of efficiency may cause most healers to start worrying about mana regeneration and their mana pool. To allay those concerns, we’ve increased base mana regen a great deal at early gear levels, while having it scale up less at later gear levels. This will make all of these changes play well even in early content such as Heroic Dungeons and the first tier of Raid content, and also play well in the final Raid tier without mana and efficiency becoming irrelevant due to extremely high regeneration values.<br />
<br />
That’s a lot of big changes for healers: reduced throughput, more triage, less powerful “smart” heals, weaker absorbs, fewer spells, and a new focus on efficiency decisions. We’re confident that we can apply lessons learned from previous expansions to make this the best healer experience yet: more dynamic, engaging, non-punishing, and frankly a lot more fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instant-Cast Heals<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/healthygameplay5.jpg<br />
<br />
Over time, healers have gained a bigger and bigger arsenal of heals that they can cast while on the move, which removes the inherent cost that movement is intended to have for them, while also limiting players’ ability to counter healing in PvP. This left silences and crowd control (which we’re trying to curb—see &quot;Pruning the Garden of War&quot;) as the only ways to actually limit an enemy player's healing output. We're still preserving the option to instantly heal, but are reducing the number of instant-cast healing abilities overall. Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Wild Growth (Restoration) now has a 1.5-second cast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Uplift (Mistweaver) now has a 1.5-second cast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
Eternal Flame and Word of Glory now each have a 1.5-second cast time when specced Holy.<br />
Light of Dawn now has a 1.5-second cast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
Cascade, Divine Star, and Halo now each have a 1.5-second cast time.<br />
Prayer of Mending now has a 1.5-second cast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of these changes taken together are intended to make gameplay more consistent between PvE and PvP, and invigorate healers with more dynamic gameplay. <br />
<br />
These are only some of the many changes that you’ll be seeing as we continue development, and what we’ve shared so far is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. We hope that as we share more with you here, on the official site, the forums, and on Twitter, you’ll get a good understanding of what’s to come in Warlords of Draenor and the direction we’re working toward. As always, keep in mind that any of this information could change over the course of the testing process. We look forward to seeing your constructive feedback!</div></div><hr />

It'll also be nice how it will most likely complement healer play, seeing as it's more triage work then instant full in one cast. I am very very pleased with the need, for now, at looking at getting rid of resilience and battle fatigue. Vanilla days only without being fireballed once and pom pyro'd instantly after in an instant gib!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, that is NOT fun to me. I like things like big heals and smart heals. It's not like you don't have to pay attention when healing now, but at least at low damage times or easier content you can relax a bit. Won't be possible in WoD. And who thinks casting 10 tiny, tiny heals that you can't even see on the healthbar is more fun then one big heal, healing for 10 times as much? The big heals take longer to cast and cost more mana, so it's already a choice to use them or not, but in WoD even the big heals will do little. I'm sure I'm not the only healer not liking any of these changes :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was. However it felt very weak for shielding for about 10% of tank maxhp in the first tier - after shielding for 20-30% in LK.<br />
Looks like we're back to that amount. I'm a bit sad to see cast time on PoM, but I trust them to balance things around the new toolset, so no worries.<br />
<br />
Disappointing or not, I liked BC heals the most. Spam some downranked shit on tank and be scared shitless when you have to move as boss melee swings were actually fucking huge. Well not always, but most of the time.</div></div><hr />

I'm stunned to see so many bad ideas in one blog. My feeling is that healing in MoP has been the best it has ever been. Now they want to put healers back to where they were in Cata, ya know, the most fail expansion ever released. I realize that human beings are great at reinventing the wheel now and then but why does Blizzard always do it on the back of healers in this game.</div></div><hr />

That is the point that you position better before casting. Remember that there won't be that many CC's on PVP and healers had the less problems with mechanics in PVE during this expansion, that is because we can do our job easly on the move.</div></div><hr />

I hope PvE encounters won't include too much movement, then. It will take a long time to adjust to not being able to DPS or heal while moving anymore :(</div></div><hr />

Good to see Blizzard fixing what they screwed up. Took merely a couple of years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You WILL be more powerful as you gear up - very much so. They're simply stating that they're designing it with a goal in mind - to ensure that mana regen doesn't reach the point that mana ceases to matter, to any real extent.<br />
<br />
I don't really see how that's a bad thing. When a DPS player uses an inefficient/incorrect rotation, they'll do less damage. When a tank does the same, they'll be more likely to die. Why should healers be the sole archetype where no matter what they do, their resource/rotation isn't an issue, just because they're &quot;geared&quot;?<br />
<br />
I greatly welcome this change. Was a little tired of the same old pattern - OoM constantly at the start of the expansion, perfect balance in the middle, no point even having a mana bar at the end of the expansion. Glad they're trying to break this pattern (although yes, we've heard this before).<br />
<br />
Not sure if I like the cast time additions, although SOMETHING needed to be done about instants in PvP. It'll just feel awkward having a cast-time on Wild Growth etc, when it's been instant cast since it was implemented at the end of TBC. We'll see how easy it is to adjust to.</div></div><hr />

I healed on my shaman, tanked on my warrior and DPS'ed on my hunter main back then, and it was fun and immersive to heal back then. Punishing you for doing the wrong choices is how healing is supposed to be, giving you a get-out-of-jail-free card with smart heals isn't fun in my eyes and have deterred me a little from playing healers.<br />

<br />
Could be a better change to reduce their effectiveness in relation to cast time heals with a glyph to buff and add cast time. Adds choice, and doesn't neuter the feel that healing specs currently have on most encounters. I honestly couldn't care less if boss fights etc. Will be tuned/designed accordingly if the specs aren't fun to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healers do not keep players at 100% because the raiddamage requires us to, we started to keep everyone at 100%, because each individual possesed an incredible high chance of failure, thus we have to hold them at the save side. If they reduce that save side to 60%, that will just induce an feeling of insecurity for healers, without actually providing any actual benefit. <br />

Druid<br />
Wild Growth (Restoration) now has a 1.5-second cast time.<br />
<br />
Either the HoT nature will make this spell pale in comparision to its &quot;instant effect&quot; counterparts, or it brings considerably higher troughput/efficiency. In the first case, druids will just opt for Rejuvenation as we did in WotLK, in the later case, why bring anyone else.<br />
<br />
All in all what I get from this blog is: The only lesson blizzard learned is that those cheap/slow heals are an ambomination which wasn't required in the first place. Everything else will just be a repetition of cataclysm and mop healing, where you have a midpack, one overpowered spec and one underpowered spec. My guess currently: Druids #1 (HoTs without requiring people to be at 100%, go figure that one out), followed by monks, holy, shaman, paladin, disc at the bottom (who needs bubbles if people at 60% won't die?)</div></div><hr />

Bursty heals is what's killing healing right now in SOO. They can't make every boss do constant 600k unavoidable hits on the raid, so instead healers have basically nothing to because smart heals are OP and take care of everything. That leads to things like Garrosh being essentially 1 or 3-4 healed.<br />
<br />
This tier should have made it obvious that healing is not in a good state. With smaller heals they can have bosses do steadier, more consistent damage.</div></div><hr />

How are you going to be more powerful if the increase of your healing spells is related to the HP of the tanks?<br />
<br />
First tier Heal is going to hit for 1k (5% of HP)<br />

There's no such thing as better positioning in many cases. See random targeted boss abilities. If you are targeted, you are targeted and need to move, you can't avoid that most of the time. But yeah sure as hell the new raids will be designed with this in mind.</div></div><hr />

I mained a healer in Wotlk, stopped healing completely in Cata and only resumed in DS. Didn't play most of MoP, but Atonement healing is very fun, especially while leveling up in dungeons, and Druid / Shaman healing are very fun at the moment as well.<br />
<br />
Going back to purely DPSing in WoD.<br />
<br />
When will Blizzard start understanding that having no mana, standing in place and being shouted at by everyone because you couldn't heal enough to save everyone is NOT FUN? <br />
I thought they'd understood this after Cata, but now they revert to that exact same idiocy. -.-<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: and healers are already pretty scarce. Usually the one role that's missing when LFR is healers, and 50% of the time I get instant dungeon invite as a healer. This is only going to become a lot worse in WoD, with changes that make healing more difficult and less rewarding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing about more than just pressing buttons and letting your healing spell do all the work for you. Learn about positioning, moving out of shit and then casting. Healing has become a joke these days. When your top 2/3 healing spells are all smart heals it kinda defeats the object of choosing what spell to cast and when. You just blindly press buttons when they come off CD and throw a couple of castable heals here and there. <br />

I healed on my shaman, tanked on my warrior and DPS'ed on my hunter main back then, and it was fun and immersive to heal back then. Punishing you for doing the wrong choices is how healing is supposed to be, giving you a get-out-of-jail-free card with smart heals isn't fun in my eyes and have deterred me a little from playing healers.<br />

Going back to dumber-heals with some thought process thrown into the game is good in my eyes.<br />

Why would it matter more for a DPS? the increased damage they do will relate in the same way to how much more hp the boss of the next tiers have instead of the increased hp pool of the tank for the healer. Same scenario.</div></div><hr />

I think the doubling is already in. Correct me if I'm wrong but the Blizzcon character had &lt;40k health. That was with a SoO LFR weapon squished to the equivalent of a Wrath levelling blue. Unless you were a tank, you didn't have 20k health until after dinging 80.</div></div><hr />

That was met with very mixed feedback. I personally enjoy GW2 combat, played it exclusively for over a year and only got back into WoW recently. I like having both games offer something different. Many people love the holy trinity and hated GW2 for messing it up. I like pure healing when it's fun, which it doesn't sound like it's going to be in WoD. :(</div></div><hr />

No, thats a fix for current expansion. They are scaling down, item lvl, and everything that goes with that, and doubling hp pools, to address changes to res, battle fat, and reducing burst damage, so you cant get oneshotted by a rogue with two cool trinkets.</div></div><hr />

Also, we made everything hit like a truck, and the DPS who are used to AoEing everything down are going to take unavoidable damage. The wipes are your fault, you may as well swap to DPS now and learn to deal with long queues.) I also like that they're adjusting the regen curve as you gear to be a little less famine in blues, infinite mana in the last raid tier.<br />
<br />
Also, WoD doesn't have the &quot;heroics are hard and we didn't bother to put any easier content into the game, l2p baddie&quot; small group PvE mindset, so that should also make the adjustment easier. Hopefully this goes better than Cata did.</div></div><hr />

What wrong with tanking? Biggest change I have seen is that they are removing the offensive component of veng so the tanks are not doing more damage than the DPS; Seems legit to me. Not sure if this breaks healing... seems like it will actually bring some fun back to it now.</div></div><hr />

Games are meant to be a challenge, not faceroll. Blizz makes a change to make it more of a challenge and people immediately think it's a bad thing.<br />
<br />
One day all I hear is &quot;LOL WOW so easy, this game has become so faceroll, I'm gonna quit&quot; then they add a FEW changes that will make it slightly harder where you actually have to engage your brain and people go nuts shouting &quot;LOL WOW should be faceroll, not hard.

I don't know who's idea it was to implement such garbage, counterintuitive changes to begin with, but I am REALLY glad to see you guys are dialing it back in WoD. Healing was simply ridiculous in this expansion, for both PvP and PvE.<br />

u do realise this is needed cos atm a healer can be cc'd and smacked about and then boom instant cast back to 100% again if you dnt like it quit, these changes are needed in PVP cos healers are hard to kill even with 3 or 4 full S14 geared people. WOD is looking better everday since ghostcrawler fucked off its about time healers got toned down yes i understand the healers side how they shouldnt be killed by 1 player but you also have to understand the DPS side and it shouldnt take like a raid group to even try to kill you when u can instant 100% so sam you aint so wise are ya buddy</div></div><hr />

I have been healing since Classic WoW and with every expansion the same conversation ensues about revamping healing. Blizzards makes alot of claims about these drastic changes to healing and the new style of healing will be much better, while providing a new and exciting experience for healers. Then the xpak hits and the changes are adapted too in about a month, if not less. After the first tier of raiding is over healing is the same as always. My mana doesnt really matter too much if I play correctly and 1 or 2 healing classes are the FOTM. Warlords will be no different. Add the fact they are just recycling the idea of less bursty damage from BC or Cata and it just solidifies the development concept of recycling play styles. So after a fortnight, maybe a little longer then new style will be learned and adapted too. Then after 3-6 months the mechanics from the previous expansion will be a vague, albeit fond, memory. The change is nice though, for me it keeps the game intresting.</div></div><hr />

'We're confident we've learned from past expansions'.... Right!<br />

We're increasing health pools to makes players more resilient in pvp (Cata balance lol)<br />

Crit sucks for healers so we're increasing it 200% from 150%<br />
Crit is too strong so we're reducing it from 200% to 150%<br />
<br />
I completely agree it just seems really weird...like they added the mana efficient heals because they wanted healers to have one tool for every occasion...then they removed them because they don't feel they are necessary... <br />
<br />
There has been dozens of examples like this occurring as of late...it just feels like they hired someone to undo the work they have done over the past years :S</div></div><hr />

Do explain. I see nothing but PvEers claiming the game is going to be dumb downed. So what does blizzard do?

And Blizzard, bless their hearts for thinking ahead, went ahead in the same blog to write how they by far have not lost sight of PvE implications and that those will be absolutely addressed. But no, you aren't content.<br />

I can also turn your statement upside down in a blink of an eye and retort: and pve fucks the game again.

Seems to me that they're deliberately making it so you can just leave someone at like 60% HP and they'll be sweet, which doesn't seem right. The point of a healer is to get people to 100% HP, and now it seems like they're getting rid of that point? Quite disappointed in those changes really. I've rerolled to monk, and the fact that Monk's uplift has a cast time is seriously gnna slow down the feel of monk healing. I get this is for PvP, but can they not add a glyph of some sort or change uplift so that it hits 5 targets in range normally whether they have ReM or not, but takes like 2s to cast, and then make a glyph that makes Uplift instant cast, but now only affects players that are under the effects of ReM? I get the point of nerfing instant casts, cause it makes PvP imbalanced, but it seems like they're taking away the fast paced enjoyable experience of PvE healing, and not taking into consideration the effects that cast times will have on PvE.</div></div><hr />

As a currently unsub'd healer who hated where gameplay went after Wrath... I like the sound of these changes. They won't bring me back all on their own, but they're the first suggested gameplay change in a long, long time where I'm not negative or neutral, but actually like what they're talking about. (I have basically zero expectation that it will end up being successfully implemented, but hey, at least its talking like a step in the right direction.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Druidjezus</div><div class="date">2014-03-07, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely agree it just seems really weird...like they added the mana efficient heals because they wanted healers to have one tool for every occasion...then they removed them because they don't feel they are necessary... <br />
<br />

<br />
I dunno, I know people like to point out every time Blizzard basically undoes a change they made recently, but I think wise developers know when to abandon ship on a concept or a mechanic that isn't working. Not sure Blizz always DOES this (we still have class based tier tokens, for example) but it's not a bad thing when they do. I have three healing classes at max level, and while only one of them has the 'efficient' heal button, I never use it anyway. It's not even on the bar/keybinds, and I have forty eight keybinds so there is definitely room for it, it's THAT worthless.<br />
<br />
I do, however, see a ton of similarity between this stuff and what they said for Cata about healing being less spammy/whackamole and more decision based with less throughput and having to use the right tool at the right time. The ONLY difference seems to be that they learned one lesson this time around and will not be having initial regen be completely horrible. So the only difference this time will be healers probably avoid spirit if it's not that powerful and just go for throughput with crit/mastery/multistrike, etc (in PvE, I know crit will probably be avoided like the plague in PvP, for, in order for it to be at all balanced in PvE, it will HAVE to suck in PvP) <br />
<br />
So, long story short, pretty much the same stuff they said in Cata except initial regen stronger and regen shouldn't be as potent at the end of the xpac because spirit doesn't scale as well. Healers will focus on throughput and the end result is the same. Only way this changes is if the health pools really do scale at least as fast if not faster than the healing throughput, so they're always triaging. If Blizz can accomplish this, then kudos, will probably make healing (and raiding, since people will need to focus more on their own survival in a world where healers don't top them off every 1.5 seconds) much more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smart heals nerf is retarded, they need to nerf the actual amount they heal for rather than make them RNG dependent. At the very least make them not pick a target that's going to be overhealed. Attonement picking someone at 90% hp over someone at 10%, what?<br />
<br />
Cast time changes are interesting, Prayer of Mending is a bad choice to give a cast time to for priests unless they seriously increase the amount it heals. Before it was good to use on the run to get some healing out while moving, but if you have 1.5 seconds to cast there are always better options.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't listen to whiners who have no idea what they're whining about since the beta hasn't even started yet. Any changes that they may or may not make will be based on beta tester feedback (positive or negative).

WoD is looking to be the best expansion to date.<br />
Here's a novel idea;<br />
Why don't we have a system where DPS specs run out of resources if they don't properly manage adds and bosses - resources other than health. You know, mages run out of mana, warlocks run out of mana and so forth - force dps players to prioritize targets they kill and require team work to optimize debuffs to cause maximum amount of damage with minimum resource usage. <br />
<br />
How about that? Would that be nice?<br />
<br />
Also remove ALL self healing from ALL dps and tank specs (and yes, I know I'm a bear and that would hurt me like hell but it would also force me to play with other people instead of solo all non-raid content in the game).</div></div><hr />

Kiljaeden's Cunning was the best ability in the game, and I haven't touched my warlock since it was removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Between this and intentionally making you have to cast multiple heals due to weaker healing in proportion to health pools = least fun ever.<br />
<br />
All of the below creates a situation in which a healer always feels behind (Never being able to top off), feels weak (spending more globals to do one thing), feels like they have no choice (whack a mole lowest health player always) and feels like they are blamed for things (Because they will be by all but the very smart players since most players will now not see the cause/effect of their deaths being their own laziness and will instead just blame perceived &quot;bad healer&quot; when it's really them not using their mitigation)<br />
End result? Healers will feel stressed way more than they are currently and we'll have less people who want to heal.<br />
Less healers is bad for all.<br />
<br />
Here is why I think this will be the case. Thoughts/comments/corrections?<br />
<br />
<br />
You all know that most players will eventually notice that they can't be killed in a single hit anymore, thus when they know one is coming they know they won't die so they won't even bother to use a damage mitigation cooldown. Right now players actively need to assist the healers in their own survival. <br />
No longer the case in WoD.<br />
<br />
Issue two is that currently once we get people topped up, healers have a chance to relax and regain some mana and prepare for the next moment of intense activity. Knowing when NOT to heal is a fun mechanic rather than just spamming heals constantly.<br />
In WoD we'll have larger health pools in relation to our heals and so will be spamming heals 100 percent of the time with no point in which we have to decide &quot;Ok, time to regain some mana&quot;<br />
This also means healers (and we all know we don't want to already) will NEVER use raid utility because they always feel like they are behind.<br />
In my opinion removing smart heals will also bring back whack a mole. Instead of before when we would see &quot;oh, someone isn't topped off, whack! Done! NEXT!&quot;(Wrath and cata) now it's &quot;Ok who has the lowest health? Him....Whack! Next!&quot; (WoD) As soon as one person is no longer the lowest health, move to the new lowest health person, never topping anyone off ever because why would you? No ability is ever going to put someone in danger of dying if at full health. Which brings me back to lazy players.......If a player is never in danger of dying in one hit, they will &quot;forget&quot; or not place importance on mitigation. They'll just think in the back of their heads &quot;oh no worries, my global is better spent on something else, I'm not going to die here&quot;. This is a major issue because it makes it harder for people to see cause and effect. Effect? I'm dead. Cause? I didn't use mitigation cooldowns and the healer ran out of mana/globals/throughput to keep me alive.......over 30 seconds. Right now when someone doesn't use a damage mitigation ability. They die. PERIOD, and it's fairly immediate so they see &quot;hey I died because I didn't use such and such ability, next time I need to pay attention and actually DO something&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Right now heroic bosses in SoO require you to move CONSTANTLY. Orbs on malk, all the crap on siege crafter, add projectiles on Sha, etc<br />
If we can get raid encounters like Dragon Soul where you could actually stand still and cast spells then it will be ok. Honestly I'de rather focus on healing than just constantly moving and relying on smart heals / hots to keep people up.</div></div><hr />

I can't for the love of god understand all the whine coming from other healers. Either you're playing an OP disco priest or you have no idea how the heroic raiding scene looks right now. Single target heals are worthless because selfhealing from the tanks are too effective right now and good luck trying to get a 2 sec single target cast off with atonement and all the other smart heals going around. It's just not fun anymore. <br />
<br />
Going back to the old healing model that we had back in vanilla and tbc sure makes me excited where you actually had to think when healing. Compare that to the current model where are you as a paladin for example spam holy radiance 24/7 just because our mastery is the only thing making us remotely viable and you don't even care about overhealing, all you want are those absorbs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rizendragon</div><div class="date">2014-03-07, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically, for disc this means:<br />
1. Atonement is dead<br />
2. AOE heals are still shit (Holy Nova is limited by range, Prayer of Healing is limited by slow cast AND by raid groups, T90 talents by casting, Prayer of Mending by casting, offensive AOE Penance by that shit Atonement change, blanketing raid with PW:S not possible because dmg is less bursty and more constant)<br />
Bye discipline.<br />
<br />
I never understand why would they punish healers every single expansion and treat them like second class citizens while DMG dealers can still be braindead and nobody will notice it.<br />
<br />
Atonement should be dead. It's the most brain dead of all the healing specs. As a healer if you don't notice a DPS being stupid then you aren't being an attentive healer. Even as a DPS I can see people (including healers) doing things that make a healer's life harder.<br />
<br />
There are 2 things that matter in raiding to a DPS:<br />
<br />
1.) Doing the most damage possible<br />
2.) Taking the least damage possible<br />
<br />
#2 seems to be where most people fail (tank, DPS, and healers alike). I agree that healing needs to be changed. I like the way a few classes heal, but the smart heals thing has gotten out of hand. PoM, Chain heal and LoD were enough. We didn't need Atonement, Healing Rain, Efflorescence, and PW: Sanctuary too.<br />
<br />
I mained a Holy Pally for a long while, and I can say that only having 2 instant cast heals is a good place for the healing classes (when I mained a HPally it was HS and instant FoL on HS crits). This seems to be getting back to that kind of a healing mindset and I can't wait for it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moradim</div><div class="date">2014-03-07, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">imo, smart heals are the problem, not so much cast times.<br />
<br />
still not happy about paladin changes though, they now have 1 instant: holy shock. putting a CD on WoG/EF messes with Divine Purpose too. They would have to buff WoG/EF considerably to make up for the new cast time, imo.<br />
<br />
wasnt the EF/mastery nerf enough? :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree. Let me look at a bar and decide if I have time to drop the slow efficient heals to top this guy up, or if I need to spend the mana to heal faster.<br />
<br />
I likened it to downranking back in TBC, and it's why I was better than any other shaman on my server. I would cast the right rank at the right time for the least overheal/best heal per mana option. At the end of the fight when the other healers were trying to regen because they went OOM I was still going strong.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
What did you enjoy about it? The fact that it had NOTHING to do with triage and EVERYTHING to do with &quot;which heal can I afford to spam with my current gear?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's about making the right choices with limited resources. If I know that my efficient heal is both slow and weak, I have to make conscious decision to use it under the assumption that the target, and other members of the raid won't die. If a group spike is incoming, I know I need to spend the extra mana to top everyone off. Intelligent use of a limited resource, rather than what I do now, which is spam Healing Rain, Healing Stream on cooldown, and fill with chain heal. There's no thought to who or how I'm healing, it's just cast that shit over and over. Healing right now is the absolute least interesting it has ever been as a raider since vanilla.</div></div><hr />

Healing spells are too powerful. We can heal someone from 1% to 100% in one or two globals, and that's not counting the other healers in the group. Add in all the smartheals running around, and if players didn't take 90% of their HP in damage in every hit, they literally would never die.</div></div><hr />

Add a cast time on our main spells (aka eternal flame and light of dawn). The ones that we do every single time at least every 3 seconds or so. Why not add a cast time on rejuv or renewing mist ? <br />
I wouldnt mind a cast time on the prism or stuff like this (like it is for disc priest for halo and stuff)... But ffs, not eternal flame, again. It's already been pretty nerfed (A LOT but understandable) and light of dawn is not the spell of the year either. Meeeh.</div></div><hr />

Admittedly, I'm a DPS priest, so with these cast times, my &quot;utility&quot; as an off-healer just diminished by a lot, as I now need to sacrifice more DPS (and Shadow's already not stellar) to act in my utility capacity. NOT COOL.<br />

Apparently they never grasped Ghostcrawler's blunder. Screwing with Healing = Shitty expansion. This was the single biggest reason people despised Cataclysm.

You have to understand that people moved to Atonement healing, because other type of healing for disc was simply bad. It's not like it was a choice. The problem I have with it is that they simply nerf (remove) Atonement and say: &quot;Hey, we fixed disc now&quot;. IT DOESN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM WHY PEOPLE MOVED TO ATONEMENT HEALING.<br />
Priests moved to disc, because holy was bad. It's the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Atonement shouldn't be 100% dead but it also shouldn't be so abused as it is right now. It became our primary triage spell because there was literally nothing better. I'm interested in how Holy Nova could change some of this. <br />
<br />
The cast times to the lv 90 talents are also needed. Right now that's where the majority of disc healing comes from and as it stands we can cast it on the fly at any time with little consequence. There needs to be more thought in Disc healing decisions. <br />
<br />
The only change I partially question is the cast time on Prayer of Mending. I'm not sure that change is needed given how smart heals are changing in WoD to be more random.</div></div><hr />

If blizz really want to make healers strugle to keep people topped, they need to go back to the Wrath of the Litch King model, quick cheap heals, fast pase. Hard to keep up, lots of spamming. Over heals is and allways have been a part of the game. You can't change it to be like FarmWille!.<br />

Removing insta cast will make healers feel imobile, slow, back seat driving. It will not feel right. I've been a wow gamer since vanilla, ended in cata in sorrow for all the changes they made.<br />

The only thing you do right here, blizz, is to make the gap between pvp and pve smaller. But by doing that you destroy the essence of healing. Fine, you want to make it like it was in &quot;ye olden days&quot; But thouse days where horribru with one shotting rogues and priests using wands to damage stuff.<br />
<br />
The right way to go will be fast pase, it gives much more &quot;rewarding feel&quot; to top someone from 10Hp to 100%. To keep spamming heals on someone at 50% and moving 10% up and 5% back makes you feel like your a car with the parking brakes on trying to pull off. And if heals take ages to load, it will make the slow pase effect even greater...<br />
<br />
sure you want to make it more &quot;noob friendly&quot; as they say. But even noobs will be like &quot;i'm a noob&quot; when they spam heals on people and they barly feel them.<br />
<br />
You're best expansion yet (according to the amount of subscribers) is WotLK. That expansion had one thing in common between all roles. Fast pase. You hit the right buttons quickly at the right time, you where rewarded with loads of healing or damage. And if you where any good, you had low overheal and a long lasting mana pool with stronger heals.<br />
<br />
If any higher ranked Blizzard developer ever read this, i will ask them to re think their concept of less overheal at slowpase. This is wrong. It will not be more noob friendly, it will not make the skill cap higher for healers, it will not make people overheal any less than ususal, and it will most definetly not make it any fun to be a healer.<br />
<br />
But hey, i don't play this game anymore. But i do keep up with all the changes, big or small. It's been a long time since a blue post has made me want to puke multiple deathwings...</div></div><hr />

We will, of course, take these changes into account when tuning specializations that rely heavily on absorbs, such as Discipline Priests...<br />
- Smart heals picking random targets: not so sure about this one, my guess is that smart healing will be changed a couple of times before launch. Anyways, smart healing HAS to be changed, no doubt about that<br />
- WoD healing being stressfull: I don't think so. If you heal dificult content without proper gear, then sure, but otherwise you should have more time to plan your actions in advance and keep your party in reasonable health levels. Do people shout at you because of wipe? Well, either you suck at healing (you need more experience, so keep learning) or it was tank/dps fault (then whay they yell at you? You should be yelling at them) or the fight was long and you went OOM (not appropriate gear of tank - low mitigation, dps - low dps or healer - low mana regen and healing output)<br />
- cast times of certain abilities: Don't mind it, it slightly changes spell mechanic and for me when I have to adapt to different spell uses it's kinda refreshing<br />
<br />
Every person has different opinion. I personally liked Cata healing, but have to admit it was very challenging (and probably dettering) for majority of healers. I would love to be once again in a dungeon when CC really matters and rogue has to off-tank one add on evasion because tank would be overwhelmed...I know - PuGs sucks, for that I welcome Proving Ground silver medal requirement to be eligible for queue.</div></div><hr />

How often do you see a DPS bandage himself or eat between fights or even use his self-healing abilities?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duridi</div><div class="date">2014-03-07, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sceptical and positive to this at the same time.<br />
<br />
- I am sceptical because it sounds awfully similar to past changes, which they ended up reverting.<br />
- I am sceptical because I worry they've moved druid healing too far away from what kept me loving my class and role at the end of classic, through TBC, WotLK and Cataclysm. I was so unhappy with the changes they made to it during MoP, that I haven't been able to play it. No other class has been able to support my playstyle either, which means I haven't enjoyed group content. What I want from the changes, is that they go back to elements of the restoration druid which has followed it through the majority of time. My scepsism tells me I might be recieving a totally different main character. I hate the thought of this, as it makes group-play unplayable for me.<br />
<br />
- I am positive because I've always liked healthbars not filling up too fast, and managing my mana.<br />
- I am positive because they are cutting down spells. Only downside is, I fear they are cutting down the wrong ones. In my opinion, Genesis, Wild Mushroom and that spell from the talent tree which increases healing done for a set amount of seconds, and makes you do dmg at the same time, can go to hell(last one is optimal, but I tried it, and hated it). Last one is the reason why I never liked my restoration shaman alt. They had a spell like that in their core toolbox if I remember correctly. It just doesn't suit my playstyle. Gensis, a bit of the same deal. I don't find these types of spells fun. Cooldown spells that increases output during healing, is boring. Cooldown spells that work as direct tool, are cool. I loved the Tree of Life rewamp during Cata. Not tried the MoP version. Wild Mushroom I hate because it's clunky. It got better after they decreased it to 1 shroom for resto(if I remember correctly), but I still heavily dislike spells I have to place with my mouse cursor. Never liked it for AoE's either, but I've accepted it as dps. I just don't see it having a place during healing.<br />
<br />
I managed to turn my positive part into something negative, but another positive side is that I know these changes might potentially give me my main back. I'm worried, but I don't think it could get any worse than it currently is. Healing as a role I am confident will be much better than it was during MoP. As for my class, worst case scenario is that it stays as unplayable as it is now. best case is that I get my favourite class and role back!</div></div><hr />

No its the Healers who will be a in LFD/LFR group and having to deal with Tanks that will think it is Mists like content and get face smash, because they pulled the entire room. Same with DPS that do stupid crap. It happened with Cataclysm and it was nerfed into the ground because people did not understand Healing change back then. And the community will repeat that same mistake in WoD.<br />

It would be nice if that were the case, but if you're not the on sitting on the top of the HPS meter, it's a strong argument to bench you if the group needs extra DPS.</div></div><hr />

When was the last time you saw a DPS bandage himself? Players have the complete expectation that healers never have to stop or pause and can keep them all at full health all the time.<br />
<br />
That is something I'm concerned with. Getting DPS to watch themselves a bit more will take some time after the days of being healed to full while standing in crap. As a healer, I do not hate healing in LFR because it is &quot;boring,&quot; I hate it because a good chunk of the LFR'ers do not bother to learn mechanics and move/dispell/stop, etc. I am hoping the proving grounds to get into dungeons will include many mechanics to react to instead of just a DPS burn.</div></div><hr />

You mean when healers had 2-3 heals to use at most? And then use the 5 sec ooc rule to regen? Not that I didn't liked that way, I love simple rotations and few spells on hotbars...but the difficulty back then was the content, not the healing classes</div></div><hr />

From the begining of the expansion, I expect a lot of wipes because of inexperienced people or people still in MoP easy-mode farming. But I thing they'll quickly find out what they can and can't afford...<br />

Edit2: oh wait, I guess there is Glyph of Penance, which increase its mana by 20% but is castable while moving. Don't see a reason to have such thing on more than 2 spells across all classes - it would seem repetitive and Blizz would be accused from running out of ideas</div></div><hr />

As a long time healer and tank I love these changes. Healing and tanking, to an extent, have become bipolar where one minute you are falling asleep and the next you are having a stroke from spike dmg. The fun curve needs to be more steady.

Okay, I have missed that change, but haven't played in a while.<br />
<br />
Still don't think it's a fun spell though. I had far more fun with it being solely a DPS thing, which I placed around as healer. I liked having that option on certain encounters, just like I liked spamming wrath during ToL on certain encounters when I had the time(that's probably not gone away, but I decided to test other talents the little time I played this expansion). The changes made to the Mushrooms for MoP, took away that fun element.</div></div><hr />
