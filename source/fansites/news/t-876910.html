The spell was originally able to be used within dungeons and raids, however overnight there was a stealth fix on the spell that prevented it from being casted in every instanced area and is now only able to be casted while outside. <br />
<br />
It was hotfixed and that should be showing up in our hotfix tracking blog tonight or tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Essentially it was being exploited to bring entire groups to the summoner, who would stealth past a few bosses, allowing the group to skip them. Guild perks should be just that, perks, and aren't intended to be game-changing mechanics. We would like to make it so that regardless of where the summoner is, the summonees are always summoned to the entrance of the dungeon, allowing this to still be very useful but avoiding that exploit-ability, but that will require further development.<br />
<br />
We're also in the process of removing its use in Tol Barad while the battle is active.<br />

Ask the Devs - Answers #3 &quot;UI&quot;<br />
Long story short: you will be able to change the order of your characters on the Character Select screen in patch 4.2.<br />
Q: Do the developers have any plans in regards to overhauling the Combat Log so that players can easier examine the results after a battle? – Jito (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: The Combat Log needs some love for sure. It was originally designed with the intent of providing players with immediate feedback, sort of like an extension to scrolling combat text and the buff / debuff panel. It turns out to be much more useful after the fact, to figure out what was that thing that hit you so hard, or what caused that proc to go off. We would like to redesign the feature with more of a post-hoc analysis in mind. It can also be a resource hog if you have it up during combat and the filtering isn’t super intuitive. One thing we have done in the meantime is made it easy for the combat logs to be analyzed by third-party sites, which makes it easier to analyze results quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Some Addons are so powerful they simplified the game content to a degree (e.g., boss fights). Do you think that when the majority are using these Addons, the original reasoning behind the game design is violated? And isn’t it unfair for players who don’t use Addons? - 冷影幽光 (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: This really deserves a long answer. It sounds like a good topic for a future developer blog. To tide you over until then, we can say that some addons do a great job of providing information we really should be providing (and have long-term plans to provide).This includes information like threat, the distance you are from other players , when you have a killer debuff on you and things like that. On the other hand, when addons are too helpful, they are playing the game for you and you’re just doing what the addon tells you to do. When the mod tells you so much information about the fight that you don’t even really need to pay attention to what is happening in the world at all, then we feel that crosses the line. I don’t know that we could put the djinn back in the bottle at this point though. It would feel really harsh to prevent addons from tracking some of that information, and in some cases we’re not even sure how we would prevent it.<br />
<br />
We continue to try and come up with new mechanics that ask players to pay attention to the fight itself instead of just pushing whatever button the addon tells them to push. You might be alerted to when Atramedes emits a Sonar Pulse, but you don’t know where it is going to be. Sinestra’s Twilight Slicer requires you to look at the battle field and not just your UI. To be fair, we are also trying to do a better job of telegraphing to players when bosses will use predictable abilities. The Conclave of Wind and Nefarian for example do their special abilities at predictable intervals along their resource or health bar.<br />
<br />
It is a fine line to decide when an addon becomes mandatory. Ideally you could raid without any addons, and some players do. Information is often power in complex raid encounters though, and we agree that in some cases we don’t provide enough information yet. Does that mean Blizzard needs to replicate some of the screenshots produced by players who install thirty mods and completely overhaul their UI? Probably not. Our raid UI is a good example of what we are going for. It provides enough information for many players (and we have plans to add more to it overtime). It’s not going to incorporate the favorite feature of every raider out there, and for them, a very customizable third-party addon is a perfectly reasonable solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be changes related to the bank and bags system? E.g. for set pieces (wardrobe), quest items, tabards... will the 16-slot-standard-bag be extended? - Yenaeia (Europe [German])<br />
<br />
A: We think bags are about as big as we can make them. Imagine if you got rid of all of the folders or directories on your computer and just stuffed everything into one big directory. That feels like the direction we’ll head if we keep down the path we’re on. Instead, we think a better solution is to make it easier to find what you’re looking for and provide alternative storage for things you don’t use often. We do have plans to convert tabards into a manager similar to our Title UI on the character page. We also are exploring some ways to let players store old set pieces and the like that they don’t use often. We debate the quest item issue a lot. Our concern is that if quest items are squirreled away in some special UI that they feel less like items at all. Why require you to collect bear asses instead of just incrementing the bear asses counter? That might help solve your storage problems, but it makes quests feel even less like you are doing something in the real world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Previously, the character was not interfered by the nameplate because there was always some space between the character and nameplates. I don’t exactly remember when but suddenly the nameplate covered the top section of the characters making it hard to identify the character/NPC’s status. I’m just wondering it was changed to be like that. – 제임**메론 (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: [We’re assuming this question is referring to the V-nameplates. If not, this answer won’t make sense.] We changed the way nameplates work quite a bit in Cataclysm. One mistake we made was anchoring the nameplate to the top of the frame. This means that when you are zoomed in close to your character that the nameplate can obscure your face. In 4.1 we’re changing the anchor point to the bottom of the frame so that it will grow up as you zoom in instead of growing down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Milling and Prospecting are incredibly dull and very manual tasks at present, especially when you do them in bulk. Speaking as a scribe, the entire manufacturing process from herb to pigment to ink to glyph is both time-consuming, boring and sending me well on my way to repetitive stress wrist and index finger injuries. – Keb (North America/ANZ), googce (Taiwan)<br />
<br />
A: Yes, we totally understand why this is a problem. The reason we can’t make it work just like other trade skills, is that we don’t know which herbs and ore you want to use. If you have some cheap ore and some very expensive ore, we don’t want to accidentally use the expensive ore. There are a few ways to fix this. One is we just redesign Milling and Prospecting. If they were recipe-based, then we would know exactly which material to use. It would also add a huge list of repetitive recipes to your Professions pages. We could also make some kind of new UI (think of something simple, like the Reforging UI) to let you drag and drop the materials you want to use. The advantage of the “box” solution is we could also use it for Disenchanting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Would you please implement a feature that allows players to change the order of their characters on the Character select screen? – 흑풍육손 (Korea), Fanahlia (North America/ANZ), Perle (Latin America)<br />
<br />
A: Sure. Does 4.2 work for you? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to implement further things into the standard UI that we currently rely on addons to provide? More specifically I mean things like Recount and Omen. - Bauertehpala (Europe [English]), Актинидия (Europe [Russian]), 柴德洛夫 (Taiwan), Terini (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: We are experimenting with adding a threat meter to our new party and raid frames. Tracking DPS is a little trickier. We feel like it’s something we should offer but we’re still debating the right way to do it. It could be something that the combat log or the achievement statistics system (neither of which are anywhere as good as they could be) morphs into.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Any plans to improve the Trade channel to allow buying and trading directly from chat? – Abolita (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: Ultimately, if you want a centralized location where buyers and sellers could meet, we already provide that. If you’re trying to just circumvent the 10% Auction House cut, we don’t really want to encourage that. If you want to use chat channels to haggle, you can do that already. The one situation where we think the current systems don’t work well is for really expensive crafted armor and weapons. We understand that players may not want to waste the materials until they have a buyer. Nor do they want to pay the Auction House cut on a 20,000 gold item when the volume on these items moving through the market is always going to be low. We are exploring some ways to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Internal Cooldowns are pretty hard to track currently (I'm thinking of Nature's Grace, since it's an important element of my gameplay as a Resto Druid). Do you plan to add a feature in order to make it easier to track Internal Cooldowns? - Anyä (Europe [English])<br />
<br />
A: This is a difficult problem to solve without a lot of additional UI bloat. We could put a debuff on the player, which is the solution we sometimes take with long cooldowns like the 60 sec one of Nature’s Grace. We could also consider something like letting players put passive abilities on their action bar, and then provide an option to view cooldowns as numbers instead of the current ‘sonar wipe’. The way some of the third-party addons handle the issue is by just throwing up more UI in between the player and the character, which is the kind of thing we are very, very cautious about adding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to expand on the current mail system? It's rather cumbersome to have to withdraw, one-by-one, my mail when I have pages of it. – Patrïck (Latin America)<br />
<br />
A: This sounds like it is really an Auction House problem. The mail system is intended to be a little throttled and slow to discourage spam and junk mail, and works just fine for “real” mail between friends, alts or guildies. The problem is the design choice we made to hitch the mail system to the Auction House. Players dealing with a high volume of commodities have no choice but to deal with tons and tons of mail (and this is particularly bad for diverse commodities with low margins, like glyphs). We are discussing different ways the Auction House can work, but we’re not convinced the right answer is just to make the mail system more automated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Before Cataclysm launch, you talked about maybe giving the chance to players of increasing their main bagpack number of slots. Are you still having that in mind or did you forget about that idea? It has been 6 long years with the same bagpack! – Proenix (Europe [Spanish])<br />
<br />
A: Believe it or not, it’s just technically challenging. The original backpack just wasn’t coded with expandability in mind, and bumping it up now carries the risk of losing players gear, which of course would be catastrophic. It’s still on the list, but it’s not as simple as someone changing a 16 to a 24.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will the Defualt UI ever be moveable and re-arrangeable without the use of mods? – Ruind (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: We are taking baby steps in that direction. We already allow you to move the focus target, and in the 4.1 patch we will let you move your player frame (your health and resource bar) and your target frame as well. We also allow quite a bit of customization of size and position with the party and raid frames. If you consider what the screen looks like with every possible UI element turned on at once (including things like the durability dummy and Arena team frames) there is almost no space left to actually see the world. If we allow players to start moving every element around, it would be very easy to stack elements on top of each other and obscure information. More hardcore players probably understand this risk and how to fix things if they break the UI for themselves. The challenge for us is making sure that players who really shouldn’t be messing with their UI don’t stumble into it. If you aren’t in the game industry (or maybe even the software industry at large) you might think it’s as simple as burying the check box deep in the options or adding a big, red “I screwed up! Please reset me!” button. But we can assure you that it’s not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What if there was a separated target system? For example, if I can set defensive and offensive target at same time then I don’t have to switch target to use heal or other emergency skills for our friend no matter what target I’m attacking. I think this feature is especially useful for some classes, such as Retribution Paladin and Shadow Priest. – Whitewnd (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: We understand why that might be beneficial, and some games have gone that route, but we’re not huge fans of the idea for a couple of reasons. One, it just adds more complexity to the UI, which you can see from previous questions is something we’re trying to remain vigilant against. More importantly, we like players having to make the choice of who their target is. We don’t want to make the game so smart that harmful spells always seek out enemies and helpful spells always seek out allies. We do this in a few rare cases, like Discipline’s Atonement, but in general we want players to make the second-to-second choice about whether they are playing offensively or defensively.</div></div><hr />

It is sad that a minority who are so determined to avoid actually playing will ruin what was a useful tool.<br />
Nonetheless I will be pleased to see the end of it in Tol Barad as that has recently become an annoying and increasingly frequent event.<br />
<br />
This crafting UI for repetitive skills sounds promising so I look forward to see how that progresses.<br />
<br />
The character ordering has been hinted at for a long time, though this is the first mention of a deadline or real intent to actually implement it beyond agreement it was a good idea.<br />
<br />
I would hope to see an integrated OmniCC type counter on buttons, because as one user described you forget that it is not a default feature because it is such an obvious enhancement.<br />
<br />
Sounds promising regarding storage, though we have yet to see the strongly hinted at dedicated equipment manager storage I believe was brought up in a previous blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Right, its that type of gun-ho code by the seat of your pants that gets more people in trouble than anything else. If you try to quickly fix anything somewhat complex, you are liable to make things worse.

LOL at breach of ToS for that Korean guy's name: 제임**메론. It says &quot;James Cameron&quot;. Pretty sure even on Korean servers you shouldn't be naming characters after celebrities. It's like someone calling their character Chucknorris. :/<br />

Anyway, one thing I wanted to add that I don't think the guy who answered the adjustable UI question took into account, is that if you screw up your UI, just kill the client. You don't need a big red &quot;I screwed up. RESET ME!&quot; button. If you don't log out, it doesn't save your UI settings. This may be within a certain time limit (yes, we have all had days where we spent over an hour working on our custom UI setup), but so far as I remember, if your client crashes (or you kill it) without having logged out, no changes are saved. The same is true for any game settings.</div></div><hr />

have guild will travel hot fix=lame<br />
<br />
so i totally wanted to do bwl with a couple of friends. i was attuned, they were not. i figured it would be easy for me to just go there and then summon them so it wouldn't take forever with them messing around in ubers trying to get attuned<br />
<br />
lame.<br />

This only takes like 20mins to get attuned, also I am pretty sure it would just port them outside the instance.</div></div><hr />

1) The ingame log isnt usless. its just a horrible mess. there is quite a bit of useful info in there if you know where to look. <br />
2) Last time I checked bots arent addons, rather a 3rd party program.<br />
3) Dude when was the last time you looked all your bags w/o an addon of some sort. Its a freaking mess. &quot;We think bags are about as big as we can make them. Imagine if you got rid of all of the folders or directories on your computer and just stuffed everything into one big directory&quot; Thats sorta what it would be like if they kept getting bigger and bigger.<br />
4) Its a nice option to have. I would much rather have my main at the top of my Server rather than underneath my rogue which I bearly play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To not have to summon your entire raid indivudually and make sure all of them got their summon isn't an overwhelming benifit? I've always been the guy to fly out to raids and help with summons but after doing it for a fiew years even I wished there was an easier way. If you were the player who sat in Dalaran for the majoraty of the time you played and cried out for summons like a tipped cow then you have no room to speak imho.<br />
<br />
(Granted I was dealing with pugs mostly and nobody enforced their expectations on them... It would have likely beed much different in an organized raiding guild where people have to account for their actions more-or-less.)<br />
<br />
But what else do you want? It's a perk that WoW could certanly survive without, but because it's there and under any other circumstances you woulden't be able to do it, why not apreciate the perks? They're convienent bonuses for staying in the same guild and I find them very useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: We think bags are about as big as we can make them. Imagine if you got rid of all of the folders or directories on your computer and just stuffed everything into one big directory. That feels like the direction we’ll head if we keep down the path we’re on. Instead, we think a better solution is to make it easier to find what you’re looking for and provide alternative storage for things you don’t use often. <br />
<br />
The underlined makes no sense at all. Each bag acts as a folder/directory so why would increasing their capacity be like removing the folders and directories on your computer? All increasing the bag size would do would be increase the number of items held in each folder, not remove the folders. They really should answer these questions honestly without using horrid examples that make no sense in a bad attempt to justify not actually improving the game. The adjustable UI answers are just as bad. So many games have that feature built in and it doesn't cause any issues yet they pretend it is an issue. Sad that those making add-ons are better at programming for the game than the games actual programmers. (For those that want to whine about that comment, look at all the helpful add-ons they still haven't figured out how to make versus those that have done so for free... these add-on guys/gals should be getting hired.)</div></div><hr />

Oh and also why it's non-trivial to allow character listings to be altered and resorted by a remote user?<br />
<br />
Well, there just must be some very dirty table and field structure plus over-static client-side representation of the default bag. But really, being an Oracle developer myself, I can't really come up with a scenario, where expanding to some more slots can have such devastating effects. It's not like they are asked to shrink it from 16 to 12.<br />
<br />
Reminds me, when I was a kid and knew nothing about arrays, so if I wanted to program more than one of something, I had to define another instance of every variable, e.g. x1, x2, ... xn. That, plus copy pasting and replacing all blocks of code that used these variables :) Then expanding stuff was indeed painful.<br />
<br />
As for resorting, it's not just client-side. You need to actually save the character order in the database, if you want to allow users to keep their character order, if they log in from other computer or after reinstalling. Not that it is extremely hard, but it still requires both server and client side changes.</div></div><hr />

For example, if I can set defensive and offensive target at same time then I don’t have to switch target to use heal or other emergency skills for our friend no matter what target I’m attacking. I think this feature is especially useful for some classes, such as Retribution Paladin and Shadow Priest. – Whitewnd (Korea)<br />
<br />
A: We understand why that might be beneficial, and some games have gone that route, but we’re not huge fans of the idea for a couple of reasons. One, it just adds more complexity to the UI, which you can see from previous questions is something we’re trying to remain vigilant against. More importantly, we like players having to make the choice of who their target is. We don’t want to make the game so smart that harmful spells always seek out enemies and helpful spells always seek out allies. We do this in a few rare cases, like Discipline’s Atonement, but in general we want players to make the second-to-second choice about whether they are playing offensively or defensively.<br />

They didnt meant that it would be hard adding a bigger bag, thats done easy without trying, they are talking about the pros and cons for the bags, and I totally agree. Back in Vanilla I had 4x 10 slots and 1x 16 slot, thats 56 slots. Today you can have 4x 24 slots and 1x 16 slot easy, thats 112 bags, doubled from what you could do just fine with before. Lets see what you will need space to, and you can ba a pala.<br />
1 HS<br />
1 stack off buff food, 1 stack of flasks, 4-5 trash items (quest items, some greens?)<br />

<br />
Just a few reasons, why you can always have more bagspace:<br />
- Farming some old instances - the more bagspace, the less downtime<br />
- Doing some serious crafting<br />
- Posting a lot of auctions - the bigger bags, the less running from mailbox/bank = more afk time = higher gold profit per active playtime.<br />
- Any kind of stockpiling stuff that's is bound to rise in price.<br />
- Being a vanity item collectioneer. You know there are these people, who want to keep all their old tier sets (especially these, which can't be obtained anymore).</div></div><hr />

The character ordering has been hinted at for a long time, though this is the first mention of a deadline or real intent to actually implement it beyond agreement it was a good idea.<br />
<br />
I would hope to see an integrated OmniCC type counter on buttons, because as one user described you forget that it is not a default feature because it is such an obvious enhancement.<br />
<br />
Sounds promising regarding storage, though we have yet to see the strongly hinted at dedicated equipment manager storage I believe was brought up in a previous blizzcon.<br />

That's all a perk should do - improve some aspect of a game just a little bit, instead of providing a completely imbalanced feature that can be exploited.<br />

<br />
A: This sounds like it is really an Auction House problem. The mail system is intended to be a little throttled and slow to discourage spam and junk mail, and works just fine for “real” mail between friends, alts or guildies. The problem is the design choice we made to hitch the mail system to the Auction House. Players dealing with a high volume of commodities have no choice but to deal with tons and tons of mail (and this is particularly bad for diverse commodities with low margins, like glyphs). We are discussing different ways the Auction House can work, but we’re not convinced the right answer is just to make the mail system more automated.<br />

I like cleanliness on my char screen. Having an 85, second from bottom below low level toons and even my bank alt is annoying to me. I'm sorry if wankers like you are too close minded to consider that other people may have differing opinions to yours. I like the rest of the changes too btw. Just really happy I'll have a char screen that is nicely ordered.<br />

2) Do you REALLY think that blizzard cant script in a 250 slot bag if thats what they want to? It takes them 10mins and problem is solved. They didnt meant that it would be hard adding a bigger bag, thats done easy without trying, they are talking about the pros and cons for the bags, and I totally agree. Back in Vanilla I had 4x 10 slots and 1x 16 slot, thats 56 slots. Today you can have 4x 24 slots and 1x 16 slot easy, thats 112 bags, doubled from what you could do just fine with before. Lets see what you will need space to, and you can ba a pala.<br />
1 HS<br />
1 stack off buff food, 1 stack of flasks, 4-5 trash items (quest items, some greens?)<br />
Your offset to, which is 17 items more, and you like tabards so you can have another 5 items.<br />
I really dont see what more you do need that you cant fill your remaining 82 slots with.<br />
<br />
<br />
My bags (by memory):<br />
1 HS<br />
5 stacks of bufffood (2 for offspec to be safe, 2 for main to be safe, 1 hit for when I need to interrupt)<br />
3 stacks of cheap food to heal me up when I need it.<br />
2 stacks of flasks (main and off)<br />
15 offspec items (dps)<br />
15 pvp items<br />
About 10 items for mainspec and offspec which I swap in when I need them (different trinkets, a bit differently itemized stuff for more avoidance)<br />
About 30 random vanity items (transforming stuff, fun items such as a mini zeppelin, yoggs tentacle etc.)<br />
3 stacks of bandages (useful for chimaeron and pvp)<br />
several stacks of goods that you just keep on getting (cloth, the dusts from disenchanted items, volatiles)<br />
several stacks of vendor junk (trying to keep it below 10 stacks)<br />
About 1-2 items which I want to wear but which I haven't enchanted/gemmed yet.<br />
3 items needed for fishing<br />
1 stack of health potions<br />
1 stack of strenght potions<br />
maybe 5 quest items<br />
2 teleporting tabards<br />
<br />
I probably even forgot some things, and this is around 100 slots already, which doesn't really give much room for anything like playing the AH or crafting (especially since I'm using 22 slot bags, as the portable hole is too expensive for me).</div></div><hr />

Hah. On my main, a spriest, I have the usual 16-slot backpack, 3x26-slot bags and 1x36-slot herbing bag. I run usually with about 5-ish slots spare:<br />
1 HS<br />
4 stacks of mana drinks<br />
4 stacks of various buff food<br />
2 stacks of flasks<br />
between 8 and 12 stacks of various cloth types<br />
4 stacks of each volatile (yes stacks of 200 x 4. Per volatile) (the life goes in the herbing bag, mind)<br />
Gear:<br />
3 trinkets for mainspec (along with the 2 equipped) for different fights<br />
1 complete holy healing set (sans staff, cuffs and wand) - 11 slots<br />
1 complete PVP DPS set (sans staff and wand) - 12 slots<br />
1 complete PVP holy set (sans staff and wand) - 12 slots<br />
between 8 and 12 quest items<br />
That's 93 items so far (worst-case). Ironically there's 94 normal bag slots in the above. I have the herb bag mostly full (possibly ~25/36 slots), and since it stores my volatile earth I have exactly 5 general bag slots free.<br />
<br />
If I want to do anything else, such as archeology, I swap my herb bag out for a 26 slot bag that usually contains archeology related items. It's currently sitting in my bank pending more time...</div></div><hr />

This only takes like 20mins to get attuned, also I am pretty sure it would just port them outside the instance.<br />

When you have more than one character on 2 or more servers and they're not exactly on the same order when we talk about main/alts or your current character on each, you will understand.<br />

Q: Do the developers have any plans in regards to overhauling the Combat Log so that players can easier examine the results after a battle? – Jito (Europe [English])<br />
Ingame log is useless. Ok. But why not use the tools like most raidguilds do? World of logs is excellent for the job. Maybe blizzard could actually learn something from them.<br />
<br />
Q: Some Addons are so powerful they simplified the game content to a degree (e.g., boss fights). Do you think that when the majority are using these Addons, the original reasoning behind the game design is violated? And isn’t it unfair for players who don’t use Addons? - 冷影幽光 (Taiwan)<br />
When the mod tells you so much information about the fight that you don’t even really need to pay attention to what is happening in the world at all, then we feel that crosses the line.<br />
There are addons that dont need user attention??? Yeah, they are called bots... <br />

Q: Will there be changes related to the bank and bags system? E.g. for set pieces (wardrobe), quest items, tabards... will the 16-slot-standard-bag be extended? - Yenaeia (Europe [German])<br />
A: We think bags are about as big as we can make them. <br />
<br />
Lying into our faces without blushing. Herb bags 36 slots anyone? Yeah, right. The bag cant be programmed to be used as a normal bag... Either that guy is very dumb or thinks we are too dumb so think 1+1=2. They changed the warlock shard bags to usual bags. I dont believe the above blue poster that the 36 slot herb bags couldnt be adapted in the same way TO FINALLY HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM!<br />

For the HGWT fix, it's a classic example of why we can't have nice things, cause people abuse it. Thing they should do is remove it completely in 5 mans, and in raids check the position with the number of bosses killed. Say now BoT, if your up at the Ascendent Council, but you wanna summon to the middle of Valiona and Theralion's room, you can, but you can't hack your way twords the entrence to Cho'gall's throne, and try to summon everyone there, and any other example. Another one is summoning to BWL without needing the attunment, a warlock, or running through UBRS to get to the portal to get up into BWL.<br />
<br />
Just make all bosses and trash aggro when you attack the last boss without the ones you need to kill to open the way are still up (so you don't screw instances where we have optional bosses). LOL.<br />
<br />
At least that's what they should be doing anyway if they're there to protect their master... lol. Ok, we have some cases where some bosses would love to live while their master is killed, so they can take their place, but it's not that it's 100% hahahaha</div></div><hr />

1. Do you really need 30 vanity items on you all the time?<br />
2. Do you really need 3 stacks of bandages at all times?<br />
3. Can't you stash your trade goods in the bank or on a bank alt?<br />
4. Why not get an addon that will vendor junk for you? There are several out there. If they are greys you wish to keep for one reason or another &gt; bank/bank alt.<br />
5. Why not enchant/gem that gear now and start enjoying them?<br />
<br />
Just the above would clear out what seems to be at least 1/3+ of yours bags. In your case the issue does not seem to be size of bags but a bizarre compulsion to be overloaded with space wasting items. I get the distinct impression that if bigger bags were given to you, you would find more things to fill them up with and end up with the same lack of space. :)<br />
<br />
Edit : your post made me forget the reason I was writing in the 1st place...Awh no more winning Tb in less than 5 mins :o</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The underlined makes no sense at all. Each bag acts as a folder/directory so why would increasing their capacity be like removing the folders and directories on your computer? All increasing the bag size would do would be increase the number of items held in each folder, not remove the folders. They really should answer these questions honestly without using horrid examples that make no sense in a bad attempt to justify not actually improving the game. The adjustable UI answers are just as bad. So many games have that feature built in and it doesn't cause any issues yet they pretend it is an issue. Sad that those making add-ons are better at programming for the game than the games actual programmers. (For those that want to whine about that comment, look at all the helpful add-ons they still haven't figured out how to make versus those that have done so for free... these add-on guys/gals should be getting hired.)<br />
<br />
Because you really know how it was coded, right? And actually understand? Right? That's why you know they're lying...<br />
<br />
Oh wait...<br />
<br />
There is a big diference between a addon and hard coding it directly into the original code... if they're just copy pasting the addon to their game, why bother with it 1st? Just let the addon programmer do it.<br />
<br />
That's why you don't understand and say that many games have it... many NEW games have it... WoW is not a new game... if they create a new MMO from scratch, or even a entire new WoW from scratch, you can bet that all these features and even more would be there from day 1. It's easier to do it now while you're currently programming it than change something that was coded, like, 5 years ago or more (we all know that WoW wasn't created when they launched it, right? There is a entire developing process that can take months/years before the day when you go and &quot;humm this game looks good, buying it now!&quot;) and have another huge amount of coding over it.<br />
<br />
Guess what could happen if the actual solution is to get rid of that &quot;special bag&quot; slot, changing it to a normal bag slot (that you can change the type/size of bag, like the other slots), so you can finally get more than 16 slots? Ops... I think you just lost 16 slots with something you had.<br />
<br />
Ok, you can do some workaround, backing up the bag data of the entire player base (if i'm not mistaken, they only keep track of epic itens when you ask for them to restore your stuff when you're hacked, for performance/space purposes, imagine the huge amount of data you need to save and actually have a way to see if you're not loosing something) or some other solution that could work... I guess you're just not changing a &quot;(16)&quot; to &quot;(24)&quot; somewhere in the code anymore. And they are probably going to that route, changing it to a normal bag slot that you can change instead of giving a 20, 22 or 24 slot bag that in the future ppl can ask again to increase it to the new current max size.<br />
<br />
Remember the things ppl like you love to say (happens a lot when we get &quot;new stuff&quot; like ZA/ZG)... &quot;blizz is lazy and only do the easy stuff&quot;... if it was easy like that, they would have done it alread, right? It makes sense with the lazy/easy comment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one hope it's not going to be a static system. IE you go in you activate it on your account somehow either by a paid service or something you activate on your battle.net , you go in change the order and that's it.<br />
<br />
See what you've posted is fine. But I dearly hope it's going to be a lot more dynamic then that as that for IMHO that's where the true potential of this little features lies.<br />
<br />
I want to be able to dynamically change the order of my toons at the toon select screen at any time I choose just by dragging them around. The possibilities here are endless and not just in the sort them by level , class or race.<br />
<br />
I have 6 what used to be max level toons only 2 of which are actually 85 right now (lolz Archeology will eat your soul and time!) . I am often switching toons so there'll be times when I'm sitting at the toon select screen .... with no earthly clue as to what toon i wanted to log onto next. So I log some random toon then remember which one I wanted. With being able to dynamically change the order I can order the toons in order of &quot;this toon has this crafting skill , this one has that , this one is my bank toon&quot;.<br />
<br />
It could even change the next day or in the next few hours. Let's say I decided each day I wanted to log my main to get my dailys done, then my dorf to do an hour of arch then my druid or warlock to get back to levelling them. *Drag around* Main - Dorf - Druid/Warlock. *Ok i have my super rare troll arch. sword* *dorf goes to bottom of list* Order now Warlock - Main - Other toons - Dorf.<br />
<br />
Let's say you are raiding and have 2 alt toons to fill the raid as needed. Main toon - Alt1 - Alt2 or Alt2- Main - Alt 1. Then you could select which toon you wanted quickly simply by using the arrow keys to login. May only cut a few seconds off the logging back in time but every second is crucial in a Raid.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying it's a killer app feature. Just that there is plenty of potential there if Blizzard did the sorting of characters at login screen correctly.</div></div><hr />

More hardcore players probably understand this risk and how to fix things if they break the UI for themselves. The challenge for us is making sure that players who really shouldn’t be messing with their UI don’t stumble into it. If you aren’t in the game industry (or maybe even the software industry at large) you might think it’s as simple as burying the check box deep in the options or adding a big, red “I screwed up! Please reset me!” button. But we can assure you that it’s not.<br />
<br />
Thank you Blizzard for underestimating your customers. Strangely enough the above mentioned feature works well in other games, even with a simple &quot;reset UI&quot; button attached. Amazing, isn't it?<br />
<br />
What this reply tells me even more, is that the trend we see with WoW becoming more and more adapted to people who should probably stick to playing Farmville, seems to be based on the assumption that the average WoW player has no gaming or computer knowledge whatsoever, or that they are 10 years old.<br />
<br />
I guess that's what happens when a game becomes more industry than a game for gamers. But believe me when I say that we don't appreciate being taken for morons, Blizzard!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">woxingma</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyway, one thing I wanted to add that I don't think the guy who answered the adjustable UI question took into account, is that if you screw up your UI, just kill the client. You don't need a big red &quot;I screwed up. RESET ME!&quot; button. If you don't log out, it doesn't save your UI settings. This may be within a certain time limit (yes, we have all had days where we spent over an hour working on our custom UI setup), but so far as I remember, if your client crashes (or you kill it) without having logged out, no changes are saved. The same is true for any game settings.<br />
<br />
If you know how to do this, you know how to press a red button. The developers are talking about the brand new folks who just don't know all the tricks yet. I had a friend that tried out wow, but then quit all of a sudden because &quot;It was too frustrating&quot;.

I had this issue when I started. I had no clue what the red actually stood for either; there was no obvious indicator that it was terrible to have things highlighted in red. After all, in my mind my gear can be grey, green and even blue! So why not red? Hints are nice and newer starting zones certainly help, but not everyone comes to WoW as a veteran of MMOs.</div></div><hr />

You need to actually save the character order in the database, if you want to allow users to keep their character order, if they log in from other computer or after reinstalling. Not that it is extremely hard, but it still requires both server and client side changes.<br />
<br />
Most everything (except for macros, keybindings, and some general settings) is stored client-side. Why would that be any different?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowy</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because you really know how it was coded, right? And actually understand? Right? That's why you know they're lying...<br />
<br />
Oh wait...<br />
<br />
There is a big diference between a addon and hard coding it directly into the original code... if they're just copy pasting the addon to their game, why bother with it 1st? Just let the addon programmer do it.<br />
<br />
That's why you don't understand and say that many games have it... many NEW games have it... WoW is not a new game... if they create a new MMO from scratch, or even a entire new WoW from scratch, you can bet that all these features and even more would be there from day 1. It's easier to do it now while you're currently programming it than change something that was coded, like, 5 years ago or more (we all know that WoW wasn't created when they launched it, right? There is a entire developing process that can take months/years before the day when you go and &quot;humm this game looks good, buying it now!&quot;) and have another huge amount of coding over it.<br />
<br />
Guess what could happen if the actual solution is to get rid of that &quot;special bag&quot; slot, changing it to a normal bag slot (that you can change the type/size of bag, like the other slots), so you can finally get more than 16 slots? Ops... I think you just lost 16 slots with something you had.<br />
<br />
Ok, you can do some workaround, backing up the bag data of the entire player base (if i'm not mistaken, they only keep track of epic itens when you ask for them to restore your stuff when you're hacked, for performance/space purposes, imagine the huge amount of data you need to save and actually have a way to see if you're not loosing something) or some other solution that could work... I guess you're just not changing a &quot;(16)&quot; to &quot;(24)&quot; somewhere in the code anymore. And they are probably going to that route, changing it to a normal bag slot that you can change instead of giving a 20, 22 or 24 slot bag that in the future ppl can ask again to increase it to the new current max size.<br />
<br />
Remember the things ppl like you love to say (happens a lot when we get &quot;new stuff&quot; like ZA/ZG)... &quot;blizz is lazy and only do the easy stuff&quot;... if it was easy like that, they would have done it alread, right? It makes sense with the lazy/easy comment.<br />
<br />
You do realize that it isn't that big of a difference, right? The auction house &amp; barbershop and more are built in and are add-ons. Also, old games allow you to fully customize the UI as well so no, it isn't just these new ones. Guild Wars even allows you to fully customize the UI and it came out in 05'. Also, when it was in development versus when it hits the store has no correlation to them providing a basic feature that play made add-ons have been doing for a long time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you should take the time to read things instead of trying to defend Blizzard without reading what was stated, okay? They stated that increasing the bag space would be like removing the folders and directories on your computer so they would rather make a specialized storage. --&gt; &quot;to make it easier to find what you’re looking for and provide alternative storage for things you don’t use often.&quot; It has nothing to do with coding but rather what it would look like with all bags open. The Q&amp;A equates having more bag space to having no folders to separate items. Except in reality the bags themselves act as the folders and increasing their size increases the number of items you can store in them. Also for them keeping having to keep storage of items on a player, did you seriously just act like it would take up a lot of storage space to house what would be simple text data? O_o You should take the time to learn at least a little about coding and it's data storage and the use of tables. It would do you some good to learn at least a little of the basics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why require you to collect bear asses instead of just incrementing the bear asses counter? That might help solve your storage problems, but it makes quests feel even less like you are doing something in the real world.<br />
<br />
Are quests really supposed to to feel like real world? When did anyone collect bear asses in RL?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have any knowledge of databases, which I doubt, you would likely understand why this isn't as simple as 'adding a up/down arrow' as others have stated, or adding a client side reordering solution. The latter is possible, if they created a mapping, client-side, to how the server orders it, so the request to 'log in to character' remains the same, but that is needlessly complex and is the 'wrong way' of adding the feature. It is 'wrong' because when you add a feature of fix an old one, you want to make the new one as modular as possible so that in the future, it doesn't become even more difficult to fix. Adding an additional layer of mapping adds a level of complexity to the code, which can leave more room for future bugs, especially unintended.<br />
<br />
Now, onto a more likely fix scenario. If the database on the server-side is access via direct ordering, and there isn't an associated 'ID' field with each character, and the associated request client side also doesn't have it, then you need to fix the client-side, interweb interface command in/out and server side database. The client needs the new UI functionality (buttons, etc.) and needs to know about the new ID schema. The messages between the client / server need to include the ability to 'log in' by ID instead of 'log into 1st character'. The server side now needs additional columns in a table, and interface changes. You must be able to understand that altering a database field in which all our characters meta data are likely stored is risky. If you screw something up in the patching, or execution, oops we lost all your characters, sorry! You have to be EXTREMELY cautious when making such an update. <br />
<br />
So, as you can hopefully begin to understand, when editing a piece of code like WoW, it is NEVER as simple as you people imagine. 7 years ago when they were coding the feature, someone probably said, 'we can't waste 6 months designing the character selection screen, let's make it work'. Had they done absolute best practices from the get-go on every possible interface, we still wouldn't be playing vanilla. <br />
<br />
I could similarly go into the coding of the backpack and why it isn't easy, but I'm afraid it'll be a waste of my time. People will complain and argue why it should be easy without any understanding or willingness to read explanations, as they always do on this website.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also wondered how can be that hard to make characters sorted by level / name / class / custom - player choice on client side. <br />
<br />
Hard coded bag is tricky, because 1st next (modified) bag probably took space directly after &quot;16 spaces&quot; of the hardcoded one. (Along with &quot;header&quot;) In storage that means there is no reserved space for the increase. Data of modified bags need to be shifted (moved) by the increase of new bag.<br />
<br />
In theory it looks easy, but in practice not so. For this sole reason, entire character database need to be rebuild. Now image how many toons are there if every person has (on average) 6 of them.</div></div><hr />

Strangely enough the above mentioned feature works well in other games, even with a simple &quot;reset UI&quot; button attached. Amazing, isn't it?<br />
<br />
What this reply tells me even more, is that the trend we see with WoW becoming more and more adapted to people who should probably stick to playing Farmville, seems to be based on the assumption that the average WoW player has no gaming or computer knowledge whatsoever, or that they are 10 years old.<br />
<br />
I guess that's what happens when a game becomes more industry than a game for gamers. But believe me when I say that we don't appreciate being taken for morons, Blizzard!<br />
<br />
Apparently, the Ev &quot;answering&quot; these questions has no idea how WoW even works. The /fstack command (typed from the chat box) will let you figure out how to set the level of a frame so it appears where you want it to, relative to other frames. I now have 0 confidence these Devs know wtf is going on in their own game. Sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that some players aren't familiar with certain elements that are rather common in gaming but instead of avoiding a UI element altogether so as to avoid them being confused, why not teach them how to use it?<br />
<br />
There are certain concepts like the reset button for moving UI elements around that they're taking far too seriously. I'm not a pre-schooler, and I'd like to think the majority of players don't like being treated like they are.</div></div><hr />

Yeah...in theory, EVERYTHING looks easy - but when your dealing with millions of lines of interrelated code - most of it added on post release...nothing is anymore. Anyone who claims it is, or that Blizzard is 'lying' doesn't have the first clue about coding. To claim otherwise simply shows the idiot you actually are ;P</div></div><hr />

Летняя ночь <br />
<br />
Ах,как коротки летние ночи. <br />
Вот уже стал заметней рассвет. <br />
Но ведь прожил я хреново очень. <br />
Много ль,мало ль,пятнадцать лишь лет. <br />
Доброты и свободы не зная, <br />
Никого ни за что не любя. <br />
Ах,судьба ты моя дорогая, <br />
Я не мог вовсе выбрать тебя. <br />
А как ты прожила,я не знаю. <br />
О твоей я не ведал судьбе. <br />
Но я с горечью всё вспоминаю, <br />
Как отец твой меня гнал взашей</div></div><hr />
