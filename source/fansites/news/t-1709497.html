Patch 6.1 - Tweetin' While WoWin'<br />
We have a new feature coming in Patch 6.1 thatâ€™ll allow you to send out Tweets directly to your Twitter feed while playing World of Warcraft. It includes the ability to send out text-only Tweets; easily take, crop, and Tweet out in-game screenshots; and let your friends know about your recent accomplishments.<br />
<br />
Itâ€™s easy to get started; all you need is a Twitter account! Under the Social section of the in-game Interface options, just check the Enable Twitter Functionality option, and then the Sign In button. Youâ€™ll be taken to a standard app approval page that will allow you to send out Tweets using the in-game UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-tweetPatchWorstThanVoiceChat&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/twitterInte01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/twitterInte01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/twitterInte02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/twitterInte02.jpg)<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/twitterInte03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/twitterInte03.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/twitterInte04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/twitterInte04.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
Once youâ€™ve authenticated the app, you can initiate a new Tweet by typing /share into chat, or by clicking the small share icon thatâ€™ll appear in-chat next to Achievement and item drop notifications. You can also add an Achievement or item directly to a Tweet with the Twitter UI open by shift+clicking the Achievement or item.<br />
<br />
Tweets from within World of Warcraft are only ever initiated by you, and we will never automatically send out Tweets on your behalfâ€”weâ€™ve disabled Addons from sending them too. Our goal is to make it easier for you to Tweet while playing World of Warcraft, and more convenient to share fun moments with friends.<br />
<br />

<br />
Of course if you donâ€™t use Twitter or donâ€™t want to see any of this stuff, just donâ€™t check the â€˜Enable Twitter Functionalityâ€™ box and itâ€™ll stay out of your way.<br />
<br />
Weâ€™re excited to see how people enjoy this new feature, and encourage everyone to jump on the 6.1 PTR to test it and provide feedback.<br />

FAQ<br />
When authorizing the World of Warcraft app it says authorizing it will let you see who follows me, allow you to change my profile, and some other things; why do you need access to do all that?<br />
The Twitter app authorization system only has a few tiers of access that we as app developers can choose from, and the one we chose was the most basic with the least access required. It will list out a bunch of features this integration does not use, and have no plans to use, like those mentioned. The World of Warcraft Twitter app only exists to allow you to Tweet while playing WoW if you want to, and only you can initiate and send out a Tweet.<br />
<br />
So Iâ€™m going to see a bunch of Tweets in-game now<br />
No, thereâ€™s no in-game Twitter feed; this feature just sends Tweets outside of the game.<br />
<br />
What if I donâ€™t want to see anything related to Twitter in-game?<br />
If you donâ€™t authorize a Twitter account through the Interface option you wonâ€™t see anything related to the feature.<br />
<br />
Are you going to start requiring Twitter use for in-game activities?<br />
No, we just think itâ€™s a cool convenience feature for those who do like sharing their gaming activity on social mediaâ€”if you donâ€™t like doing that, no problem.<br />
<br />
Isnâ€™t this going to cause a lot of spam, or issues with people sending out inappropriate content from the game?<br />
This doesnâ€™t add any functionality that isnâ€™t already achievable through Twitter. This simply makes it more convenient to link items and share achievements and screenshots while playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/twitter10.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/twitter10.jpg) <br />
<br />
Is there a separate login per-character, or is this account-wide?<br />
Your Twitter authorization is Battle.net account-wide. Any WoW license (as well as any characters) within the same Battle.net account will be able to Tweet from an authorized Twitter account. Youâ€™d want to sign out of Twitter through the Interface options before logging out of the game if you donâ€™t want the authorization to persist between logins.<br />
<br />
My child uses my WoW account sometimes; will they have access to Tweet from my Twitter account?<br />
The Twitter authorization will remain active until you log out of it through the Interface options.<br />
<br />
I donâ€™t use Twitter, but I do use some other social platforms, when could this be implemented for those?<br />
Weâ€™re starting with Twitter, but the /share functionality certainly could be expanded to other social platforms if you would find it useful. Weâ€™d appreciate your feedback and ideas on where we could go next.<br />
<br />
This seems cool but I havenâ€™t tried Twitter yet, how can I get started?<br />
Twitter has a helpful guide (https://support.twitter.com/articles/215585-getting-started-with-twitter) to get you started, and we maintain a list of official and employee accounts right here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6933956493) that you can follow to start building your list.<br />
<br />
How moddable is this by Addons?<br />
The UI is fairly locked down to keep access to sending Tweets secure, and ensure that youâ€”and only youâ€”are choosing when to send them. Addons may still perform some light functions, such as helping to populate the chat field in customizable formats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that you mention it, I too find it strange they didn't include at least one for testing the feature like they always do.<br />
<br />
Something along the lines of &quot;140 characters, all of them lvl100! - Use the Twitter integration to share an achievement or selfie of your character to your friends outside WoW&quot;</div></div><hr />

How many months did it take for them to make this? Far too many I'd guess. Instead of a second raid tier you get twitter.<br />
<br />
So you are saying that this really DID cost us a raid tier. Fascinating!</div></div><hr />

But it doesn't bother me. I'm perfectly fine if there are things that I don't care about.<br />

Me too, it's just really becoming a big list of things I don't care about for me. So I will just cancel my subscription sooner than usual.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why they started with this. There is no one in game who gives a crap anymore what achievements others obtained let alone your friends on twitter and possibly in the future your friends on facebook. <br />
And I have yet to find funny WoW screenshots or clips on social media. I've seen a few pass by on facebook of GTA V but what is there to show in WoW?<br />
<br />
I just don't see a lot of people using this. I only see people here saying &quot;ah, cool tech&quot;. Yeah real cool, or I could just alt-tab and do the same exact thing... Or people who don't care about it.<br />
<br />
p.s. I would block anyone posting that crap on social media btw. I don't give a f*** if you got some lame achievement or how you character looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spoiler alert: Nobody cares.<br />
<br />
I think that's why some people think this feature is so annoying. For anyone actually on twitter, they'd probably find it irritating if someone posted about an achievement or a piece of loot they obtained. For anyone not on twitter, it's straying further and further from WoW's audience. The majority of this playerbase is mid to late 20s and older, and these are generally people not interested in using twitter for a video game.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has finite resources to spend on UI development, and instead of refining or fixing issues people have been complaining about they developed a new feature which a minority of users will take advantage of... Whenever people feel they are spending money on a product and it isn't going towards things they want, they will complain, plain and simple. People have a right to complain, and you have just as much right to ignore it, or tell them you like the feature, but everyone paying for the game has a right to complain when the money they send blizzard isn't used to improve their experience. But having the right to bitch doesn't mean you should expect change or special treatment.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I'm talking about. This feature wasn't developed by the people that make raids, zones, etc. It was probably developed by a very small team and has barely affected the development of other content. This supposed lack of content isn't due to the twitter integration, I'm pretty sure of that.<br />

I think its a better representation than what you see on their forums. Especially since any blizz bashing these days gets your perma-banned.<br />
<br />
If you call them out on any item where they have either contradicted themselves, or made some stupid arbitrary last minute decision under the radar that has a huge negative impact on the community as whole, or in the very least that new feature they are adding, it gets squashed/silenced. So what you see are their forums as everyone who plays is happy with their game, is skewed and censored.<br />
<br />
Bottom line &quot;bitter veterans&quot; or not you're get a more realistic picture as to how the game and its development is received.</div></div><hr />

Blindly hating? It's been documented that the average person's attention span is dwindling to zip.

The team responsible for developing this feature has nothing to do with fixing bugs, developing raids/dungeons, implementing new quests or whatever other types of content you'd like to claim you lost because of this Twitter integration thing.

Oh, well since you're clearly a Blizzard insider with detailed knowledge of how their development resources are divided up, how about providing some further information on the process?

I railed against Facebook because I realized it was a pointless, self-serving, circular method of people masturbating to the glory that is themselves. My experience on there personally? It was mundane. I was linked into a myriad of political and news pages so that I was being updated on events/discoveries but didn't care much for actually using it to socialize for the above reason.<br />
<br />

I'm not even against texting per say(you're now jumping subjects here buddy) but against this whole system of every waking moment having to be a catalog of your daily events.

Add in the influence of smartphones and you've got a constantly integrated system that is impossible to get away from. People are by and large absorbed in it and it IS hurting our society as a whole, whether you want to admit it or not. I funny enough don't really judge them as much as I judge the jackasses who want to fight me on the obvious details and rally to the defense of what is little more than evil in its sum.<br />

Very well said, I see things pretty much the same way. I think that there are others who do as well but they are willing to 'play the game' because it's not worth missing out on what their friends are doing. Which is essentially what you have to give up if you want to rid yourself of it.</div></div><hr />

OnT: I think it's fairly obvious that Blizzard are trying to lure more people into the game, and even though I hate to say it, this is a brilliant move on their part. People will essentially be advertising the game for them on social medias. Personally, I won't touch this feature with a cane.<br />
<br />
But I have to say that I do prefer Twitter over Facebook.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. This is just another indicator of the terrible direction WoW has been headed in for awhile. &quot;We can't maintain subs because we can't seem to create compelling content? We'll appeal to the mouthbreathing twitter youth!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I agree that the constant need to post about everything is annoying. Fortunately me and my friends only use facebook to quickly send messages and rarely anything else, so it really depends what kind of people you have on these sites.<br />

I think of social media sites as just another tool that's been misused by the wrong people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think of social media sites as just another tool that's been misused by the wrong people.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, those who misuse it and have garnered a sort of 'picture' as to how social media is now viewed, does not deter the usefulness of social media.<br />
<br />
Though I was somewhat harsh on Kelliak with the hipster comments lol, my issue is the constant 'oh great teenager 8 year old bullshit' comments constantly coming out of the more rabid posters in these forums. Furthermore, the threats of alienating those who will use the Twitter feature or anyone who partakes in social media, it's just childish. People have different tastes. Those tastes do not devalue them.<br />
<br />
I am not all that huge a fan of social media, but I can see it's purpose, not everyone who uses it is a hashtagger, or some social justice warrior, or some douchebag ranting and raving about his pecs and how awesome his life is.<br />
<br />
Just like anything media related, the negative is usually much more portrayed and garners a lot more attention than the positive.<br />
<br />
<br />
so when is the instagram and facebook patch? since we're appealing to 8 year olds now, and all.<br />
<br />
Example A. Though it's Moradim, his negativity could fuel a China sized army of angsty nerds that can never be pleased. Your posts do make me laugh though. Though I fear for your health, considering the amount of salt you seem to have in your body.</div></div><hr />

That is the thing using the services when needed is no problem, going overboard with using them well that's another matter.. Heck I have a Freakbook acc but rarely use it and when I do is only to send messages to friends and relatives.. I even have a Twitter acc as well never got the hang of it so stopped using it, tools like Freakbook, Twitter and so on are just that tools and when used correctly are completely fine..</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
They're misused by the majority and to such an extent that it is damaging in the long-term.<br />
<br />
I mean I am not anti-everything when it comes to social tools. For instance I use Skype, Steam, Battle.net, and Hotmail - the NSA likely has entire filing cabinets with my name on them. Different mediums for different folks basically. I even text on my phone, yes, my piece of shit can do as much. I just don't need internet on it and a several-hundred dollar price-tag attached to it.<br />
<br />
Twitter, Facebook, Myspace, and so on I avoid because they're the headiest form of this new poison and I've seen it firsthand. They've even influenced me in negative ways. Like I find it hard not to socialize now in a constant stream of back-and-forth(oh lord the wanton need for gossip). It's like I've been unplugged but my thirst lingers to be constantly somehow involved with other people. It IS improving though and I find myself slowing down more. Which is a good thing. Allows me to focus. Enjoy moments better and so on.<br />
<br />
It does however create this false image for many that I am somehow an 'outcast' or trying to be 'hip'. Hardly. I'm simply worried about my health and the health of others in an era where we're so suddenly bombarded with a myriad of mental disorders. Very complex ailments that can be utterly crippling and this digital age has done us a great deal of harm versus benefit. It's good to consider just how much and how one might be able to dial that back some.<br />
<br />
To me, the easiest sacrifices are sites like Twitter and Facebook; likely the most impacting for many too.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly how i feel about facebook. I gave it a try after listening my friends moan for few years about why im not in fb. Didnt see the point of it. People updating every mundane thing that happens in their life, went to gym, had a shit, cooked some food and went to sleep. Posting selfies and pointless links and those fucking fb game invites just so they could see how many likes they get.<br />

Deleted my profile few months after. If i want to get in touch with someone id rather call or meet them face to face.</div></div><hr />

Same, I don't want you spoiling every detail of your life to me over a site. It's nice to have something to talk about when I come over for a beer and grill. To me that's proper socializing and healthy.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of these kids today have mental problems due to the internet. It's becoming a massive medium for whoring yourself out for attention. Then when they don't get it or get really negative attention, it destroys them. Many parents aren't yet equipped to deal with this growing situation, hence why they're so ignorant and lost from what results in the end.<br />
<br />
Companies like Blizzard really should not be further encouraging it in my opinion. It is a brilliant marketing move but just... unsavory in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

Most of the posts that are against this feature can be summed into &quot;I'm afraid of change and I don't understand even the basics of game development and modern business practices so this feature sucks!&quot;<br />
<br />
And I don't care for this feature either, but if you think no one will use it, you're seriously mistaken. Twitter is a very popular app and implementing this feature will create even more publicity for Blizzard, which is essential for today's businesses.<br />

<br />
If you call them out on any item where they have either contradicted themselves, or made some stupid arbitrary last minute decision under the radar that has a huge negative impact on the community as whole, or in the very least that new feature they are adding, it gets squashed/silenced. So what you see are their forums as everyone who plays is happy with their game, is skewed and censored.<br />
<br />
Bottom line &quot;bitter veterans&quot; or not you're get a more realistic picture as to how the game and its development is received.<br />
<br />
Seriously? Where the buggery did you pull that from? Have you ever actually BEEN to the WoW forums before you made that bull up up? I mean really dude, I've seen some crap on the MMO C forums, but you just won the lottery of made up crap.<br />
<br />
It's literally nothing but complaining, 99% of the reason people go to the forums is to complain. X Class is OP, Y class is crap, you suck, unsubscribe, fix feature, crappy idea, nerf DKs! Nerf Pallys! something about complaining about something player doesn't understand, crappy idea, x class is op....and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
For all of you fanbois who says the integration of this turd and the selfie turd doesn't cost you a raid or content or whatever, you are wrong. I will explain it to you: In the big adult world, let's call it the real world, companies work with budgets. Thats a sum of money! Now they used this sum of money for this turd and the selfie turd. So like with your candy that you get from mummy and poppy you can only give it to either your brother or your baby sister. Same goes for the sum of money which went to the people who made this turd and the selfie turd. Now the people who make the quests and the actual content, well they did not get the sum of money so they can't make the quests. Is it all clear? Or should i make drawings?<br />
<br />
In your attempt to be condescending, you've just made yourself look even worse than the people you think are dumb, and the way you've gone about it just makes you look like a ignorant child who thinks he's part of &quot;the big adult world&quot;, yet clearly knows nothing about the subject he professes to be so versed in. Selfie camera would've taken any decent programmer five minutes. It's literally just turning the camera round and doing a screenshot, you can do it now with the mouse. Twitter intergration would've been handled by the UI team, it's not a massive feature and you're a fool to think that the UI team is the same team that work on the dungeons and proper content, heck it was likely the web development team, and they obviously don't work on the game.

Are you really comparing a patch that was put out in 2007... to something put out in 2015 wow we could give blizzard the benefit of the doubt because their team was much smaller and it was their first expansion so they were somewhat new at expansion patches. Nowadays though there is no excuse with the vast array of technology improvements, much larger wow dev team and having 5 expansions experience and sub rise and fall numbers under their belt.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard made a usually lengthy post about new thingy to the game.<br />
&quot;People&quot; see this post and then they think it automatically means blizzard spent 4 months making it and they completely wasted time doing that instead of new content.<br />

It doesn't have to be like that at all. They can make these blog posts for people who are having hard time to figure out what it is for and for what they can use it. If anyone thinks there are no people like this, consider yourself delusional. I think they could have decided to add this feature like in December and develop it in January, but that is because they are company. Any individual programmer could have done this within a week. <br />
<br />
So, do not worry, you will get your content and as you see, BRF was just released and you expect new content within 2 weeks?? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-02-11, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so when is the instagram and facebook patch? since we're appealing to 8 year olds now, and all.<br />
<br />
Oddly, the average age of Twitter users is 25, and female. There is no demographics for 8 years olds, social media is primarily for adults. A Facebook tie-in would be attractive, as I think 60% of social media users are Facebook users, but I haven't seen stats for 2014 yet. Facebook, if I still played WoW, would be a insta-unsub thing, as I don't trust Facebook, especially over privacy issues, and I suspect Blizzard wouldn't like the demands Facebook would have over access to player's info. I hope. <br />
<br />
I think, from my layman's viewpoint (and with 20+ years in marketing as a professional), this is being done for two reasons - exposure, and to bring in new players in the 12-18 bracket. They need to repopulate the game as older players drift off due to life and the demands of adulthood. The need the next wave of players, and they expect social media tie-ins, as they've been surrounded by it for most of their lives - it's &quot;normal&quot; to them, because it's always been there from day one. Kids in that age bracket use Twitter a lot, along with texting, Facebook, and Instagram. Kids in that age bracket have different expectations, needs, and interests than adults - like the somewhat new phenomenom of kids in that age bracket going nuts for videos on YouTube of toys and games being unpacked and opened. They also use Twitter and such playing the games they start out with - Minecraft being the big one. <br />
<br />
And, I think the most damning thing about this is, it's being trumpeted as a major upgrade/content as part of 6.1 - when it's not. It will be used (for now) by a small segment of the players, while the vast majority feel stiffed with the lack of playable, open world content. IF 6.1 had a ton of stuff that was exciting - quest hubs, a quest/daily scenario like Landfall!, or new dungeons, this Twitter addition would barely be noticed, or even commented on. <br />
<br />
Honestly, as an older player, it's like getting socks for Xmas in your first present...and there's only a couple more packages...with underwear. It's not exciting, but your parents are trying to act like it is. But, I could see a 12-18 year old thinking it's cool - and I guess the 25 year old female WoW players will love it, if demographics are anything to go by. <br />
<br />
And, for those who -correctly- point out that it's not the devs who make quests and content who put this together, other than the interface guys...so what's the content guy's excuses? All of the dev time from almost the beta of MoP, to now...resulted in 6.1? For all of the time we waited for 6.0 and 6.1...you'd think we'd have stuff being thrown at us at Wrath levels...but it's not.<br />
<br />
It just doesn't add up. <br />
<br />

Yup, I think the feature is useless since I do not care about social media, but don't make yourself look like complete morons by asking snide questions about &quot;where's the content&quot; during a in-between presentation of a side-project.

I don't think Blizz would do this at the expense of lots of other features for the game so I also think it's silly to say it is costing us content. :) The screenshot crop box seems to be actually useful for any screenshot; I hope some mods unrelated to the twitter functionality can make use of that.</div></div><hr />

The amount of hate that this has been getting pretty much proves that people will complain about anything given the chance.<br />
<br />

It certainly cost something. There is a serious amount of development effort in this feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The problem isn't the feature itself but the way it's presented and advertised. When your little silly thing that connects the game to twitter gets MORE hype, effort and attention than legit player concerns / other things that would benefit the actual game you only got yourself to blame when players get mad. It's the same way with pandas. I don't hate pandas, I don't hate twitter, but I do hate how both were shoved down our throats like it's the second coming of Jesus Dalai-Lama Christ. So you made a feature, fine, put a patch note in there but leave it at that, no need to make endless blue posts and videos to show us it's there when players want attention about more legitimate, game-related things and issues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2015-02-11, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People saying that this was a &quot;free&quot; feature lack some real knowledge from WoW, it's code, blizzard resources and all that they've showed us in 10 years of WoW.<br />
<br />
Just check the feature by itself. It's not just a lame 140 char text export to twitter. You can actually crop the image, link stuff, etc. they did put some effort on doing it on a 10 year old code. Remember how problematic for them was to just put up realid chat on the launcher? Remember how usually you have to adapt your code to create a conection to an external service like twitter (that is not owned by Blizzard, so it's a diferent beast that they have to learn and integrate into WoW's aging code) that wasn't supposed to exist years ago when most of the WoW code was created?<br />
<br />
So right there you've got some UI team and programmers doing that for some time. Sure they could say that they've put some time and effort to update the WoW code to be easier to integrate new stuff like that (unlikely), but it's the same UI/Programmer team that later says that they don't have enough time to put up some tabard tab UI/code for example (that we think it was updated to be easier on this). The same teams who took that long time to bring a heirloom tab UI/code (wich uses some of the assets already in the game from the mount/pet account system).<br />
<br />
And remember that they do exchange info and stuff (and sometimes even members) between the teams.<br />
<br />
When you sum all that, you can see that coding a marginal system (both in usage and game changer) like the twitter integration is kinda of waste of time &amp; resources from Blizzard's part. I would prefer them working on fine tuning their already existing system UIs, fixing bugs that do exist on them and keep developing those promissed systems, like saving action bar templates (so we have less problems with changing more than 2 specs) or like the tabard tab that they keep postponing. I would even enjoy some dancing studio instead of twitter integration hahahaha.<br />
<br />
The amount of resource/time wasted on selfie cam goes the same way. It's something they did just for the sake of keeping WoW on the trending topics, will get some really low usage and they have some stuff higher on priority that will have way more use and bring more to the game.<br />
<br />
And in the end, we have to read they saying that selfie cam, twitter integration, garrison soundtrack, BE updated models (pending stuff from 6.0), class tuning... are huge amounts of NEW CONTENT. The same way they tried to count LFR, Normal and Heroic versions of the same raid as new bosses (so a raid with only 6 bosses sudently became a raid with 18 bosses)...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliazer681</div><div class="date">2015-02-11, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So in reality, people aren't mad because twitter integration is what's causing them a &quot;lack of content.&quot; That's ridiculous, and anybody with half a brain and knowledge of the development cycle is aware that the people who worked on Twitter don't work on raid content. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
People are actually mad because this is another step towards &quot;Omg the evil casualization!&quot; Hardcores/tryhards (utterly interchangeable) are upset about a fun social media feature because it's just another way for people they perceive as &quot;non-geeks&quot; (their lifelong persecutors, if you ask them) are able to enter and enjoy their &quot;geek&quot; space (safe place). These are the same people that hated meeting stones, then random dungeons, then LFR: anything that makes the game more accessible to a wider (and in their mind intellectually &quot;lesser&quot; audience) is not a boon to them, but an insult.<br />
<br />
tl,dr: Lots of fascinating communication theory/sociology at play here, and a lot of insecure neckbeards who probably don't actually enjoy WoW that much anymore but cannot walk away, therefore must whine about everything/compare it to some idealized &quot;glory day&quot;<br />

Think of how many people are on twitter, sure, but think of how many people are actually on the internet. I'm not saying WoW is made up of some sort of &quot;hipster nerd category&quot;, and in fact that came from you and you alone. I don't think most people are saying that.<br />
<br />
If you said &quot;More than 5% of WoW players have used twitter at some point&quot; I'd agree with you, but I can virtually guarantee you that if you took a poll of how many WoW players actively use twitter, since that is the type of player that this is actually aimed towards and nobody else, the number would be below 5% easily. If you choose to disagree, sure, go ahead; there are no active statistics for you of how many WoW players have an active twitter account. But I really think you're way, way overestimating how many people actively use twitter. It's no Facebook, it's not mass appeal and most people who &quot;use&quot; twitter in those statics you'd likely show aren't people with actual accounts that post but instead simply people who have viewed or browsed the site.<br />
<br />
Also, please get off your imaginary high horse. If you don't have any facts to back up your insulting claims towards people, then don't say them or at least voice them in a slightly less immature tone. You're not &quot;intellectually dominating&quot; anyone, you're coming off as a late-teens kid with serious social issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Askmrrobot's team made : infographics which is the best thing what could happend with PVE players for a long time. WITHOUT asking money for that service.<br />
Blizzard made: implemented twitter what the wow players' 95% will not use. and all of us paid for this...<br />
(and #wow will their own commercial thing when you post something...)<br />
<br />
Well down Blizzard: The greed is real!<br />
Nowadays Blizzard is like governments they give a sh*t about the people's opinions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightHaawk</div><div class="date">2015-02-14, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem isn't the feature itself but the way it's presented and advertised. When your little silly thing that connects the game to twitter gets MORE hype, effort and attention than legit player concerns / other things that would benefit the actual game you only got yourself to blame when players get mad. It's the same way with pandas. I don't hate pandas, I don't hate twitter, but I do hate how both were shoved down our throats like it's the second coming of Jesus Dalai-Lama Christ. So you made a feature, fine, put a patch note in there but leave it at that, no need to make endless blue posts and videos to show us it's there when players want attention about more legitimate, game-related things and issues.<br />
<br />
You mean one blue post and one video. How many time do you people have to complain about it?<br />
