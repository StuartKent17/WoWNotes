PvP Season 16 Ending Soon<br />
After an in intense season of conflict in Arenas and Battlegrounds, the time is coming soon to see who has climbed to the top of the PvP ranks. Prepare to fight your last battles of this season, and remember—there is no substitute for victory!<br />
<br />
With the upcoming release of Patch 6.2, Arena and Rated Battleground Season 16 will be ending. Once the patch is live, we'll begin a roughly two-week process to determine end-of-season reward eligibility.<br />
<br />
All players who believe that they may have qualified for PvP Season 16 awards should note the following:<br />
<br />
In order to ensure you receive your award(s), please refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after PvP Season 16 has ended.<br />
PvP Season 16 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points at the end of the season, and any Honor above 4,000 will be converted to in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. A few other things to keep in mind once the season has ended:<br />
<br />
The Honor cap will remain at 4,000.<br />
Season 16 items with rating requirements will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
Rated Battleground and Arena matches will not be available during the break between seasons.<br />
We will confirm the start date of the forthcoming Season 17 in a post here in the weeks to come.<br />
<br />
<br />
In war, you win or lose, live or die—and the difference is but an eyelash. To the battlefield!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was the announcement for Season 13 ending soon. On August 13th.<br />
<br />
The patch came September 10th, almost a whole month later.<br />
<br />
It's not always 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
The fact that they also ALWAYS gave a &quot;as soon as X date&quot; before but didn't here should be enough to dissuade you from thinking &quot;GUARANTEED 23RD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it likely? Very much so. Is it guaranteed? No. And I bet you'll still be shitting on Blizzard for lying to you if it doesn't release on the 23rd, despite them not giving a date.</div></div><hr />

Admittedly the blue post, different from what you linked, about that one said the pvp season would end the 27th. (Idk if it did or not and there was a 2 week gap). Going to find it now</div></div><hr />

That doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
People say &quot;IT ALWAYS RELEASES&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that was DELAYED and it actually took longer than 2 weeks. The point I'm trying to make is that THINGS CAN AND WILL HAPPEN. It might not come on the 23rd due to a myriad of reasons and this is in no way a guarantee. As I said, it's very likely, but not guaranteed. But you guys are too busy jizzing over it.<br />

Sometimes they gave a longer warning because of bigger changes to PvP systems. Doesnt change 1 bit that the majority of times it was always 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you understand what always means. You're like fucking Brian Fantana. 80% of the time it was 100% of the time 2 weeks!</div></div><hr />

Personally I think it's unlikely to get pushed back just because of how last week went with 1/2 of normal being tested at once and I believe all mythic testing done except repeats. SoO was testing new stuff iirc right until the end. <br />
<br />
It could get delayed but, to me it looks like it would be something Major that would need to happen. There's bugs for sure, but that looks like that's all that's left. Last build was bare bones minus tuning.</div></div><hr />

I know it (like most other MMOs) isn't a wow-killer app, but it's amusing to look back at how many patch days line up closely with competing product releases. :P Predictably well-played, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

You didn't, but others are taking this as basically a promise that it will be 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
Listen, guys - they didn't give a specific date this time for a reason. Is it 99% likely the 23rd? Probably. But not 100%.</div></div><hr />

I understand that there's every single time someone like you posting about the same shit no one actually cares... but I'm going to rephrase it for you, its always been 2 weeks, except for the times where they announced 2+ weeks because of bigger changes to PvP systems.</div></div><hr />

&quot;It's always been, except for X and Y&quot;<br />

That is not always. That is MOST OF THE TIME.<br />

<br />
Ofc it isn't guaranteed. A nasty last minute bug can always delay stuff.<br />
But 3 major indicators point towards the likeliness of a 24th release now<br />
- major competitor releasing something big<br />
- RC candidate builds coming up<br />
- 2 weeks from PvP announcement</div></div><hr />

You can't say &quot;always, except&quot; - you're directly contradicting the first word with the second.<br />
<br />
I realize this is purely semantics and bordering on the autism spectrum, but that's what the internet is for mane. It's not always. I'm not sure how else to explain it.</div></div><hr />

But his point seemed to be that &quot;regardless of past events, it's always 2 weeks, thus it's guaranteed to be the 23rd!&quot;<br />

I don't think he was using always-except properly, he was using always and completely disregarding everything else.<br />

That's valid, certainly. And speaking of &quot;always&quot; rules, there are always people bitching and moaning that Blizzard lied to them after a patch. And that's an unqualified always. :P It's akin to a universal constant.</div></div><hr />

What did I already say? It's extremely likely to be on the 23rd and I actually count on it. But it's not guaranteed. I bet there were people back during 5.3 saying &quot;it's always 2 weeks guys! They said it was the 27th!&quot;<br />

Given that complainers are such cancer on the forums, this statement is terrifically on-point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure, the PTR is down for now. Season 2 honor gear may, or may not, be 670 though.<br />

<br />
Because FFXIV's expansion drops the 23rd. Cue the bullshit line from Blizzard that other companies releases don't govern their release schedule.<br />
<br />
Or maybe because most companies want to end their 2nd quarter with a big release and plan these things regardless of what the other company is doing. But no, it can't be because of investors; the narrative doesn't allow for that.<br />
<br />
Firelands patch also released at the end of June for the same reason.</div></div><hr />

http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10621491/pvp-season-13-ending-soon-8-13-2013<br />
<br />
This was the announcement for Season 13 ending soon. On August 13th.<br />
<br />
The patch came September 10th, almost a whole month later.<br />
<br />
It's not always 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
The fact that they also ALWAYS gave a &quot;as soon as X date&quot; before but didn't here should be enough to dissuade you from thinking &quot;GUARANTEED 23RD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it likely? Very much so. Is it guaranteed? No. And I bet you'll still be shitting on Blizzard for lying to you if it doesn't release on the 23rd, despite them not giving a date.<br />
<br />
That doenst mater soon by tradition is 2-3 weeks especially when you have release build like 90% of the tie that means exacly 2 weeks in some rare situations they can delay if notice some serious problem in PTR(thats why they say soon instead to givig us a date)</div></div><hr />

Just like they released a big content patch to counter Star Wars. I'm not arguing that doesn't also have a large part to do with it but don't insult our intelligence when it's obvious their content dropping the same day as competitors time and again is more than simply coincidence.</div></div><hr />

Already bought and paid for. There nothing in 6.2, but a raid, the rest of the stuff we been doing since launch. I might be back if they seem to make more than Timeless isle content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I wouldn't really call a game of &quot;Stomp or get Stomped&quot; (battlegrounds) and &quot;My CDs vs Your CDs&quot; (Arena) anything 'intense'. <br />
<br />
Combining that with the sour effect from playing warrior, dk, ret and rogue ... just to find out the &quot;general melee&quot; is the class we play. With the rogue having stealth....<br />
<br />
I think it's horrible how similar all the classes play these days. There is no &quot;rogues have to work the positional requirement, but have quickly regenerating energy and hard hitting expensive abilities&quot; or &quot;paladin can purge himself from all kinds of harmful effects and stuns and selfheal. He doesn't deal a high amount of burst damage though.&quot; or the all versatile warrior that could bounce around a battlefield only if stancedancing... <br />
<br />
Classes got so similar. I'd honestly call the last season the most boring pvp play wow ever had. Cookie cutter layouts previously was NOTHING compared to the 'even if different class, it's still basically the same'.<br />
<br />
And since they aren't going &quot;wow - 3 mill were allready bored out, the next content is not even a month of interest, after that only the hamsters have something to do (farm 4 difficulties) - let's change something radically!&quot; nope. Same shit, different patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
670 for honor, 705 conquest<br />
<br />

650 or 675 (if lucky) + upgrade to 695 (20k apexis)</div></div><hr />
