&quot;The passive healing bonus from Walk in the Light has been reduced to 5%, down from 15%.&quot;<br />
Apparently they were going to nerf Walk in the Light by 5%. But according to the wording, the healing is REDUCED TO 5%, and not REDUCED BY 5%. Would that be a mistake ? Otherwise, it might not be true that fixing Conviction will result in an overall buff to holy pally healing.</div></div><hr />

* The bonus healing provided by Conviction now functions correctly when healing other players.<br />
* The passive healing bonus from Walk in the Light has been reduced to 5%, down from 15%. This change is to balance against the fix to Conviction, but still results in a small overall buff to paladin healing.<br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1. About time they fixed Conviction.<br />
<br />
2. 15% to 5% is a 10% nerf. Conviction provides 9%, so it's a 1% nerf. -1% != buff. Am I missing something? I know a 1% nerf isn't much but it's just that they say it's a buff when it's not that bugs the crap out of me.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they were very specific about Walk in the Light being nerfed from 15% to 10% in the &quot;4% buff&quot; post. So either this is a typo, or it's an actual nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Previously you could ONLY loot the 372 tier from ChoGall and Nefarian. I.E. they did not drop the 359 tier token. Meaning that guilds running heroic mode CG and nef could not get the 359 tier item you need to get the heroic tier gear (the system works like the heroic tokens in icc). This is merely a fix to make it possible for guilds killing heroic mode endbosses to actually be able to use the heroic tokens that drop.<br />
<br />
Until now the loot table from cho'Gall hc would look like this.<br />
4-5 epics<br />
1-3 heroic tokens.<br />
<br />
now it looks like this:<br />
4-5 epics<br />
1-3 heroic tokens<br />
1-3 normal tokens<br />
<br />
normal mode loots tables were not changed.<br />
<br />
Also there are reports that Heroic chests are dropping off halfus 10hc. maybe the 25hc was a typo and they meant 10m?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to use upgrade tokens to upgrade the 359 pieces. However, the heroic bosses only dropped the upgrade token. Therefore, people who didn't get regular shoulder tokens before their guild started killing heroic Cho'gall/Nefarian were completely screwed.</div></div><hr />

They said that both changes will result in a 4% buff to paladin heals.<br />
<br />
Actually, its a 0.55% nerf. 105% x 109% = 114.45%</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget about Divinity in your calculations. Divinity makes the difference even smaller.<br />
<br />
Also, Conviction uptime wouldn't hurt.<br />
And Holy Shock's interaction with Crusade appears to be a buff due to the way the modifiers work.<br />
And Protector of the Innocent wasn't bugged with Conviction (Conviction still worked on self-heals).<br />
And Protector of the Innocent's beacon transfer would have to be reevaluated.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, the new spell linked on the notes by Bibi has Walk in the Light reduced by 5% to give 10%.<br />
http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85102/walk-in-the-light/<br />

Blizzard is trying to hide few more of those atm by talking of buggs beeing fixed. Its a well known trick.<br />
<br />
Taking an ability from 15% to 5% is a major nerf. Overall the result is that more mana is beeing used for less healing effect. Add that to 10% mana cost of many healing spells and the results are pretty obvious. <br />
<br />
THey are upping the needed skill level of holy paladins. Good holy paladins will still do great. The rest will suffer and probably not bother playing as holy.</div></div><hr />

Huh? What's the change? Those bosses have always dropped those items. Must be an error.<br />
<br />
The only change is that Magmaw now drops tier rather than Atramedes.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why they say 25-man. It was retarded from the start having harder bosses drop the items for 10-man anyways, but I guess Blizzard needed a month more then their players base to notice. Or 10-man just aren't on their priority list when they got vendor values on grey items to fix.</div></div><hr />

I couldn use dp evertime coz it was fucking 15s 50% less healing.. so ... now its only 9s and more reg ( 18% instead of 15)</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more, I thought one of the main changes in Cata was to rid the game of this archaic view that if you were killing stuff on 25s, you deserved better loot than 10s - guess I was wrong.</div></div><hr />

Instead of nerfing the spec that it in good place, they should fix the ones that are underpowered, imo.</div></div><hr />

An additional change to this functionality is slated for patch 4.0.6.<br />
<br />
err .. whats that mean? you can complete set (normal set, 359) only if you kill nef and cho'gall on HEROIC? that doesnt make any sense to me ..<br />
<br />
I think it means that they will drop the heroic token and normal tier aswell. Since top end guilds may just want to farm heroic to get there tiers, a lot probably still dont have reg tier, this way they can get reg tier while doing heroics at the same time and later be able to upgrade to heroic tier with no problem.</div></div><hr />

If Conviction did more healing to begin with, both changes could easily result in a net buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1. About time they fixed Conviction.<br />
<br />
2. 15% to 5% is a 10% nerf. Conviction provides 9%, so it's a 1% nerf. -1% != buff. Am I missing something? I know a 1% nerf isn't much but it's just that they say it's a buff when it's not that bugs the crap out of me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You were misunderstanding what Blizz had said in regards to 10 and 25.<br />
<br />
Blizz said they believed the loot should be the same ilvl (no longer required to run 25s for the best gear) but that there should still be an incentive for the people who put in the extra time to coordinate 25s (or at least not be at a disadvantage)<br />
<br />
The incentive came in the form on a higher chance of certain gear drops and a higher number of drops. This helps to counter the effect and time of having to gear 1.5x more raiders in 25 man than in ten.<br />
<br />
A guaranteed drop in 10s means a geared raid in 10 weeks whereas 25s means 25 weeks....double the time for 25s. In terms of progression ten mans would come out ahead since gearing would required only half the time.<br />
<br />
There needs to be a balance and sorry but this is the way to maintain that balance.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes that's why the top 10man guilds killed all heroic bosses well before the 25mans... oh wait... What was it? 6 or 7 bosses out of 13 dead? Total un-tuned 10man hcs, less loot for a HARDER boss? Yup, balenced. GG. The fact is you get about 12 loot for a hc boss max and 3 for the EXACT same boss (if tuned correctly) for the 10man, how can you call that BALENCED when they can get 4 times the loot? Half the raid can get loot in a 25man hc now, whereas a 10man 1/4 will get it, yup once again balenced. Please....</div></div><hr />

so much for having more freedom to place talent points, same old cookie cutter specs....<br />

That's not really how it is. You can't just blow off a core talent. That would be like me, as a raiding mut rogue, saying &quot;WTF BLIZZ? I have to take Cut to the Chase? What is this crap!&quot; You'd have to be an idiot not to take CttC. You can never have complete freedom from mandatory talents, that said, you still have a lot of freedom.

Im a PvPer and find there are more useful talents to spec into. Obviously for PvE its mandatory, but for me in PvP its a 10% nerf...</div></div><hr />
