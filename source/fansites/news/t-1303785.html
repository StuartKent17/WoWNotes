<br />
It'll still be more successful than the other MMO's by that time if the path it's taken so far is anything to go by.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am surprised at this, and I wanted to see Titan this year at Blizzcon, but I don't mind. If they feel like the path they took was bad and are going to upgrade it and make it better I can't fault them for it. Plus having more developers in other games will be nice.</div></div><hr />

To be honest I am, I was convinced it was pure vaporware. I'm shocked its even got to the stage where it can have a direction to travel in. Though after what Bliz did to wow, starcraft and D3, I'm not falling for it again, I'm definatly waiting to see what its like after it launches, and not buying into the hype for preorder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I think if they had given us ANY hints about what Titan was even about, then I would be more interested in it being delayed. But I don´t think there was ever even confirmation that it was an MMO.<br />
<br />
It must be hard for them to plan a big project that takes 5 years when things change so rapidly. You gotta think that something that failed in the past 2 years is what is causing them to have to reset.. Diablo´s RMAH? SWG? GW2? None of which have been huge successes.<br />
<br />
I was still guessing that Titan was going to be a FPS MMO in space, a way for Blizzard to get those COD people paying a monthly sub... but who knows.. we know NOTHING about what it was supposed to be, and now that isn´t even happening..</div></div><hr />

I mean, is the game going to be a hologram projection like in Star Trek or something, because that's the only reason for the game to be in development for so long and not even a teaser screenshot, nothing? <br />

How can you keep resetting the whole game?</div></div><hr />

That's at least the 3rd game Blizzard has cut their losses on (including the WarCraft Adventure game and StarCraft Ghost). Overall probably a good thing rather than releasing trash. (Leave Diablo 3 alone, LOL!)<br />
<br />
It does make you wonder where WoW would be today if more of those 100 developers had been working on it. Probably a few of the 3D modelers who actually knew their stuff (I'm not a fan of most MoP gear models, or Cata for that matter).</div></div><hr />

To be quite honest, I think Blizz should've revamped WoW to a 2.0 engine already... the game is still nice, but with the amount of cashflow they're generating it should be no problem to have WoW's graphics overhauled...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 4th season of Arrested Developement is a disaster. worst garbage ive watched in a long time.<br />
<br />
They should have ended it in season 3 when it was still good. <br />
<br />
Guess blizzard can just cancel Titan now and go bankrupt already. Nothing of value lost</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at where they say they're sending their devs<br />
<br />
WoW - In the middle of a disastrous subscriber decline, one of the largest they've ever had<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 expansion - D3 launch was a mess, it was received poorly for several reasons, and continues to have problems with things like the AH <br />
<br />
Blizzard All-Stars - repeatedly delayed, supposedly that one's been restructured already before.<br />
<br />
Battle.net - see above regarding Diablo III, it's also not been without problems in WoW and Starcraft 2.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Starcraft 2, that seems to be the only one of their current franchises which is doing fine, and isn't getting new devs.<br />
<br />
I also don't see a mention of Hearthstone, but it looks pretty good from the videos they've shown, and they've deliberately kept the scope of it fairly small, so it might not go way over time and budget.</div></div><hr />

Some other Blizz Guy: We need to scrap something but what..... Oh i know 99% of the playerbase knows nothing about titan, we can scrap it, tell them it got delayed, delay it again further down the road, and eventually people may forget about it!!!!<br />

<br />
Titan doesn't kill WoW, it was never intended to kill WoW. Im fairly sure their intention is to transition teams from WoW to Titan. The customer support would get trainings for the new game etc. I think you either misunderstood the &quot;crowd&quot; or the crowd doesn't understand Blizzard's business intentions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you keep resetting the whole game?<br />
<br />
Ever thought about that things like that are EXACTLY the reason why Blizzard made great games in the past? Not BECAUSE they hugely delay their games all the time, but because they WILL do it if they feel it's necessary.<br />

This whole thing is not great news for anyone interested in their next-gen MMO (like me), but there really is no &quot;doom&quot; here.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, frankly, the XB1 has me about as utterly unimpressed as 98% of gamers that even looked into info about it (let alone were sorely pained watching the actual press release) in that they said virtually nothing about games, and all about &quot;TV TV TV TV TV&quot; and how they got some major exclusive deal EA Sports. Whoop-dee-doo... I'd be perfectly fine without seeing the next game go multi-platform, cause with Blizzard's usual design timeframe, it won't be done within a fair time for half of those companies (see: StarCraft: Ghost) to even want it.</div></div><hr />

Wildstar? I don't know too much about the game, seems confusing though an interesting concept. However, I wouldn't be so quick to make it the next &quot;WoW Killer&quot; MMO. I know you didn't mention it that way exactly, but every year I hear about a new MMO that's going to top WoW and it gets a little sad to always be wrong lol. SWTOR, Tera, Rift, and Secret World to name a few.<br />

<br />
If we knew a bit more about it I might muster some emotion about it all. Thankfully we don't, and Blizzard handled this right from the start by keeping us in the dark, so we don't know what we're potentially missing. Better to keep it under wraps, reprioritize and do it properly and not rush it instead of releasing something half-arsed. We can wait :)</div></div><hr />

really ? delayed and rebuilt from scratch by the sounds of it in 3 years ? an MMO no less and you expect it to be high quality ?<br />
I fear that with Mr Wilson involved we are looking at another wasted opportunity for blizzard to release a quality game. It will be a rushed project to meet the 2016 deadline they have now set themselves, and will come out worse that Diablo 3 because there is a certain *** **** involved in it.</div></div><hr />

This was my thought as well. They did say that Titan was suppose to be more &quot;casual&quot; than WoW, if you can believe that.<br />
Not to mention the current design team of Wow has been in charge for what, an almost 4 million loss in subs? <br />

I always thought/believed that we would get 2 more xpacs for WoW and then Titan would be released to well take over in some way but now well damn.<br />
To me this means that Blizz will have to make some real changes to WoW or they are going to be in royal deep shit, what I mean is WoW is in decline and is their no.1 money maker and yes it will be for quite some time, 1-2 years it will still reign supreme (unless Wildstar really can pull the rabbit out of the hat).<br />
However despite this any company worth a damn must always have new projects in development in order for at least one to well take over when the current project expires, WoW will end that is a given but as W3 led to WoW it will lead to something else and the majority of us thought this to be Titan but that is now being sorta shelved (call it development hell like with movies).<br />
Blizzard will therefore need to either do a massive revamp to retain and even gain new subs or it is going to hurt them where it counts most their wallet, we all know cash is king and they are loosing it right now, they need to make sure that don't start to hemmoraghe or they will be fucked.<br />
So what does that mean for WoW, well maybe a new engine, add player housing, dance studio, path of the titans, all the cool stuff they mentioned and never delivered on plus a shitload more goodies or their number will go down.<br />
I like WoW it is my no. 1 game but hell even I know that changes need to be made, what those will be who knows only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am surprised at this, and I wanted to see Titan this year at Blizzcon, but I don't mind. If they feel like the path they took was bad and are going to upgrade it and make it better I can't fault them for it. Plus having more developers in other games will be nice.<br />

We've been waiting on more info for years and now they suddenly take a giant step, basically nullifying alot of the time thats gone into it, and we still know nothing!<br />
Moving 70 developers of the project cant be good for the actual project itself, sure it might be great for the other franchises but jezus, another 3 years for 'the next big thing'?<br />
We've officially known about the thing for 3 years already, with leaks and such going back to 2007 even.<br />
The original timeline had it scheduled for a release Q4 2013, now that seemed unlikely for blizzard standards but starting over again entirely while cutting out 70 designers?<br />
It'll be 2020 before we see a trailer at this rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you freaking serious?<br />
The downfall of WoW IS because Blizzard went to listen to player feedback!<br />
I so remember Vanilla and even TBC that Blizzard's feedback was so poor and changes made to classes were so slow and minimum, Blizzard did what they thought was best.<br />
People didn't like that their classes were unique and wanted to be able to compete with other classes in every way, so blizzard did that and that was the worst thing they have done imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at where they say they're sending their devs<br />
<br />
WoW - In the middle of a disastrous subscriber decline, one of the largest they've ever had<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 expansion - D3 launch was a mess, it was received poorly for several reasons, and continues to have problems with things like the AH <br />
<br />
Blizzard All-Stars - repeatedly delayed, supposedly that one's been restructured already before.<br />
<br />
Battle.net - see above regarding Diablo III, it's also not been without problems in WoW and Starcraft 2.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Starcraft 2, that seems to be the only one of their current franchises which is doing fine, and isn't getting new devs.<br />
<br />
I also don't see a mention of Hearthstone, but it looks pretty good from the videos they've shown, and they've deliberately kept the scope of it fairly small, so it might not go way over time and budget.<br />
<br />
StarCraft is the only franchise that's stayed true to itself. All the others people got a hold of them and decided to shake things up, take it in new directions, and we see how that's panning out.</div></div><hr />

They've seen their business change a lot in the last two years and while the changes haven't been good, they haven't come even close to driving Blizzard out of business or anything.<br />
<br />
Anyway with all of that perhaps they took a look at it and decided that what they thought it should be four years ago would be largely irrelevant in a couple of years. I agree with whoever said it was likely to be reconfigured for mobile. Probably F2P as well which it very likely wasn't intended to be to start with.<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll scrap it, maybe break it up into a bunch of smaller mobile games. Will be interesting to see what comes from this. Business conditions change; Blizzard is slow. They need to pick it up. I don't believe that taking 3-6 years to develop a title is a good way to do business any longer. Of course a side-effect of that will be the possibility of less polish or as polished but much smaller. Hearthstone-sized games are perhaps where they are going for the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have larger problems to deal with, WoW's not even a problem since subs are fine. Titan is supposed to be the next-gen of MMO, but what I don't see is how they will make it really successful like their other IPs because the other IPs have built in fanbases. This new title is ENTIRELY on faith and supposedly a brand new IP that will be marketed to existing players of their games in order to be a decent seller. By the time this title comes out their playerbase will have moved on... 3 more years is not a short time.</div></div><hr />

But, tbh i'm not surpriced a bit. How would they make a new mmo, that surpasses their current one in wich they've invested all their resources for the last 8 years? Even their current mmo is losing subscriptions! So, it cheaper to just revamp wow, instead of releasing a second 'old-fashioned-titan'. They'll probably start thinking about a new and cheap product that's easily made availlable in a short period of time, and wich is more in line with the current demand. Bit like dota2 or leage of legends. But for now, let's hope they incorporate all the good stuff into wow!<br />

<br />
So much this! +1 for you!<br />
<br />
Come on people, every game loses people. Why aren't you playing halo anymore? Because you have seen it already.<br />
So please cut the crap that MoP is bad and people are leaving because of that.<br />
If you have played this game for more then 200days you will know what i mean by in the end you have seen a game and you want something new.<br />
That has nothing to do with the game getting worse...<br />
<br />
All they did was making a way to play WoW without having no life.<br />
Difficulty has been the same or maybe even more difficult.<br />
Life has been made a lot more easier for every player.<br />
<br />
I'm really feeling that blizzard is getting back a bit with listening to players.<br />
A good example is the resilience revamp, they basically went back to Vanilla style that PvE players can also do bg's without getting 1shotted if you didn't got PvP gear which you must farm and takes time and you don't want that because you are giving plenty of time already to raiding.<br />
<br />
In Vanilla i did a lot of bg's and i loved it, then i needed to do PvP and Raiding in in every tier and that is just too much, people will choose for PvP or PvE most of the time and not do both anymore which in Vanilla was not the case.<br />
So they are making pvp more accessible like in Vanilla, but giving players who pvp a lot some prestigious stuff.</div></div><hr />

I know right?!?! ''OMFG I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS GAME'' How can you be hyped or excited about something you know nothing about literally... To me this is good, or doesnt bother me. First because I dont know SHIT about the game, the Real name is not Even Titan for gods sake. Im haveing lots of fun in WoW the warcraft universe has lots to go about, so more ppl can be good, as for Titan itself if they were'nt happy with it, Im glad that they stoped it and reboot it. Thats actually something I wish more companies would do, sadly, lots of MMo's and games launch because ''well i think it may be ready''. <br />
<br />

<br />
I don't understand this argument. MMO's are a genre of game, saying &quot;x game is a WoW clone because it's so similar, with some different changes and additions&quot;... so? WoW copied Everquest, Everquest took ideas from other games, Command and Conquer had things WoW stole. It's kind of hard to re-create an entire genre that has pretty much been this way...since the start. You get variations like MMOFPS, like Borderlands, but that is obviously not an MMORPG. The game has plenty WoW doesn't, but that's not enough for some people.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is that it's kind of like saying every FPS game is a clone of another FPS game because they all involve guns and shooting each other. What FPS game ever 'changed' how FPS were? They're all the exact same, with variations as well. You have your Quake and a similar game was Halo, you have your realistic, horrible CoD games. Every card game is the same because despite having different cards, it's still a card game. <br />
<br />
I'd guess 2016 is a number far too kind, I don't know what kind of problems they had, though. Keeping their MAIN people to change things, sending everyone else back to other games, bring them back later?</div></div><hr />

To be honest I am, I was convinced it was pure vaporware. I'm shocked its even got to the stage where it can have a direction to travel in. Though after what Bliz did to wow, starcraft and D3, I'm not falling for it again, I'm definatly waiting to see what its like after it launches, and not buying into the hype for preorder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Way too negative. What did Blizzard do to StarCraft exactly? StarCraft is awesome. Hardcore Brood War fans didn't like StarCraft 2 because they invested 10 years of their lives in Brood War and set the bar for a sequel WAY too high. StarCraft 2 isn't the #1 most popular &quot;eSport&quot;, but it's very strong, heaps of people watch it, and it's a fun game to play. The story was meh, but most of the time Blizzard stories are lame and cheesy.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't prove anything. They can easily just say that and people will believe it. If this article wanted to have any credibility they would provide an actual source. But people will assume there is no credible source because the employee's at Blizzard wouldn't want to lose their jobs if their caught leaking secret information in which case it doesn't make any sense for them to leak information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember a project called Diablo 3. It's still quite bad. Also, Titan was another MMO, despite what it may be about, they don't need another one. They need better writing, updated models/animations in WoW, and simply just more resources put into their current games to make them the best they can be. New titles can be exciting, but better content for older games to me is more rewarding for both the player and the devs.</div></div><hr />

Venturebeat broke the news earlier today (http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/28/blizzard-delays-unannounced-mmo-until-2016-resets-whole-project-exclusive/) that Titan has been &quot;reset&quot; and will be delayed until at least 2016. The decision was announced to employees a couple of days ago and sources close to the project gave us more details on the subject:<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard felt that Titan wasn't going in the right direction and decided to make significant technological and design changes to the game. This happened in the past with Starcraft and Warcraft 3.<br />
A smaller dev team will be in charge of redesigning the project and about 60 or 70 developers are being moved to other teams (WoW, Blizzard All-Stars, Diablo 3 expansion, Battle.net)<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard didn't officially comment on the subject yet, hopefully this is a step in the right direction and Titan won't have the same fate as Starcraft: Ghost.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mentioned this in the Titan thread; anyone who read my post saw this coming.</div></div><hr />

No....the bigger question is...What the fuck are you talking about?<br />
Do you not know your posting on a forum where everyone knows eveyrthing, a place where whatever you do someone here has done better and lets not talk about all the posters in this place that seem to think they work for blizzard...not only do they design/develop and invest in the company but on the side they are actual clairvoyance's!!! <br />

Blizzard has a bad track record with console games. Starcraft: Ghost, remember that? They should just give up on it and stay with the subscription PC game cash. It doesnt quite make sense that they are redesigning the game because it will be on a different system. All you have to do is change some programming, not the content of the game. And the new consoles are coming out this year, they will be old in 2016.<br />
<br />
Anyway it doesn't surprise me that they would scrap and redo Titan since they do it with every game they make.</div></div><hr />

...because they aren't human, and don't care about their jobs, and if things actually started to get to a point where they had to worry (which they aren't at yet), they would just stand around with their thumbs up their asses and not do anything about it and lose their jobs.<br />

Warcraft 4 hasn't been announced and is probably not in the works.<br />
<br />
SC2 recently had an expansion. I know it's your whole thing to mindlessly bash WoW but seriously? They don't run activision style releases with games like Starcraft and Diablo I wouldn't expect to see another Starcraft expansion for a couple more years, Diablo's will probably come sooner and even then the logical choice is to divert your resources to your primary source of income.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So glad there people like you else the forums might get boring after a while! <br />

But on a serious note, what does Activision have to do with this?? Blizzard thought their game was substandard so they pushed it back. It's not a practice that's unheard of. Very saddened by it but hopefully it's for the best.</div></div><hr />

To be honest I am, I was convinced it was pure vaporware. I'm shocked its even got to the stage where it can have a direction to travel in. Though after what Bliz did to wow, starcraft and D3, I'm not falling for it again, I'm definatly waiting to see what its like after it launches, and not buying into the hype for preorder.<br />
<br />
Oh stop. Blizzard is a public company. They cannot make statements like some big new product is coming and not be working on it. That would land them in major hot water including massive shareholder lawsuits.</div></div><hr />

How can people say this? We know absolutely nothing about Titan, other than its the next MMO by Blizzard. I know that being a Blizzard game alone gives it lots of praise but after the failure that was Diablo 3 and the direction that World of Warcraft is taking.

Of course it's vaporware, it hasn't been announced or confirmed as existing. Everything we know currently is all based on rumors including this setback. So why would you be getting your hopes up based on a name with no details at all what the game is about? It could be a children's game for all we know.</div></div><hr />

I've read quite a few articles in which the developers expect both MMOs to co-exist. From what I had heard Titan was completely different from WoW. The way in which it was described it felt like PlanetSide 2 (FPS) mixed with various mythos. If Blizzard could coordinate a WoW expansion release alongside &quot;Warcraft&quot; -- I believe subs could very well surpass previous records. As of April, we know Legendary Pictures and Duncan Jones are actively working on the film.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throrion</div><div class="date">2013-05-29, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading between the lines, it's almost like they feel they're dropping the ball on their current projects, while focussing on Titan, and are trying to get their existing business back on track as well as what they say about Titan<br />
<br />
Look at where they say they're sending their devs<br />
<br />
WoW - In the middle of a disastrous subscriber decline, one of the largest they've ever had<br />
<br />
&quot;Disastrous&quot; is a pointless word, not to mention inaccurate in every possible definition in this particular context. Yeah, their subscription numbers have been dropping, but the VAST majority of the people who quit have been from the Eastern markets (China specifically), where they basically pay breadcrumbs to play compared to what we do in the west. So, in terms of actual profit, they're doing just fine. Also the WoW dev team has been growing steadily despite the decreasing subscriber numbers, which says quite a lot about how ridiculously profitable it remains.<br />
<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 expansion - D3 launch was a mess, it was received poorly for several reasons, and continues to have problems with things like the AH<br />
<br />
Yes, the D3 launch was a mess. Blizzard have shown that they understand most of the issues though. Specifically with the PS3 announcement, it was pretty clear that they realised how the always online requirements and the AH issues were some of the main problems with the PC version. So, assuming they get that sorted out across the platforms, the only remaining major issue with the game will be the dreadful story / far too on-the-rails environments, which is the exact kind of thing a good expansion can rectify. That, coupled with the change in the top of the project management roster, means the D3 expansion has a very real chance of being able to redeem the game, at least in my books.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard All-Stars - repeatedly delayed, supposedly that one's been restructured already before.<br />
<br />
Uuh. You do realise they delayed and restructured the project because they turned it from a silly little SC2 mod / sideproject into an actual fullfledged standalone game, right? You are trying to make this out to be a... bad thing? lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.net - see above regarding Diablo III, it's also not been without problems in WoW and Starcraft 2.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you're even trying to say with this. The revamp of the battle.net interface in HotS for SC2 has been nothing but positive. In WoW, the recent battle.net infrastructure additions have allowed people to play with their friends across realm with no loading screens, which is fucking awesome. The ONE negative thing I suppose, if you really wanna scrape the bottom of the barrel, is that you can't show as offline in WoW yet, but... really? This just seems like conjecture.</div></div><hr />

No like we didn't know it would happen, but now they have pooled more resources back into WoW then it's defintely expected.<br />
I'd like to hope there is an increase of quality now due to the extra people, we can only hope.</div></div><hr />

EA is just as bad, if not worse.<br />

Getting some of the talents back on WoW and D3 won't hurt either after the catastrophy-clysm and some of MoP's massive issues.</div></div><hr />

It seems to me that they were making a Shooter based MMO. The problem with shooters is Hacking, you can't stop it no mater how hard you try. So they probably have to redesign the engine so they can do tab target while giving a shooter feel. <br />
<br />
The difference between a shooter and tab target is how the shots are registered to the server. In a pixel perfect Shooter like COD the client tells the server where the shot will go, and for how much. In most tab targets, the client says the user wants to do this shot to this target, the server than figures out if it is a hit and for how much. The reason shooters use that method is because of server latency and lag. the 0.001 difference can mean a hit or a miss. Where as a Tab Target the calculations can happen under heavy lag and latencies with out much difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Nobody wants this.<br />
You don't even know what the game will be about let alone any sort of particulars outside of a supposed genre. Hope this isn't one of the things that comes from your mouth when your first born is announced.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShimmerSwirl</div><div class="date">2013-05-29, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly think this is a case where Blizzard has realized the ultra-casual, accessible mindset is not a sustainable game design model. Look at what the Blues have been saying for the past few weeks, 25 man is more epic than 10, premade groups required for Heroic Scenarios instead of using LFD, hints of bringing back more class-specific content. All of this is a return to the olden days of 'hardcore' wow. <br />
<br />
Blizz originally announced that Titan was going to be even more casual than WoW. A 'core design change' to me in this case indicates that this may be changing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Penguin</div><div class="date">2013-05-29, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like they realized skimping out on WoW and diverting most of their resources to it was ruining the game. Maybe if we're lucky WoW will get it's own &quot;realm reborn&quot; remake. The only problem I fear is that if they do not return most of the designers that made the original WoW, and fire the ones that came in at Wrath's end and worked on Cata and MoP, the game can and will flop probably.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Planetarism</div><div class="date">2013-05-29, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bwahaha. It always baffled me how people would put so many thoughts and desires into thing that they know literally nothing about, except name. Hello! &quot;Titan&quot; is not some holy grail to replace and conquer everything else, it is just another project from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can only be a good thing. And since we knew NOTHING about it before or how far along it was, we're still in the same position.<br />
<br />
<br />
How is blizz able to build so much hype for a game we know nothing about amazes me lol<br />
<br />
Oh yea man it's like, we know -nothing- about Titan, it could be anything at all.. (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1246232-Megathread-Titan-Speculation?p=20708215#post20708215) Could be Hello Kitty, Twisted Metal, or even Katamari Damacy gameplay, etc.. right..??<br />
<br />
..hahahaa..<br />
<br />
&quot;[..] You play as one of three classes, a neo-anarchist groupie, a japanese style mecha-using cyborgish faction, and the overlord class. The overlords are related to the Titan in the &quot;Titan&quot; working title; they have come to earth to steal a resource that keeps life vibrant and flourishing. You can play purely as a non-combattant, on Wii, Psvita, and facebook, and apparently battle.net. The MMO part is Team Fortress, where you interact with the Titans, and then you have quests that allow you to interface with the non-combatants by leaving the Team Fortress-y area.<br />
<br />
All of this is done over a grand scale of time-travelling, and you server-hop or shard shuffle, however you wanna put it. So if you don't want what one shard has to offer, you pick and choose others.<br />
<br />
There is a combat side and a purely non-combat social aspect to Titan- you go out into a huge battle against mecha-esque constructs (Titans), you vie for resources. Everyone who chooses to fight a la Team Fortress, does so against EVERYONE ELSE in the game who is choosing to fight. You can do quests, and accomplish objectives in this realm. When you have had your fill of fighting, you pick a shard. Each shard is community owned, ran, managed, created, and controlled. If you like the community in shard alpha, you spend your time there, if not, shard beta might be more to your liking; it will not have the same layout or &quot;feel&quot; as the other shards. If all you wanna do is hang in the non-combat world, fine. You can have fun just as much as the next guy. But combat will never come to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;..I think this makes a -lot- of sense regarding all the bits Blizz execs have shared about this already. It all fits what their explicit &amp; implied goals are, audience aimed for, lessons learned from WoW's server infrastructure's limits, how they've been wanting to take advantage of consoles and social media networks' explosively far-reaching appeal &amp; integrated easy-of-use (several tens of thousands of Farmville/Cityville/etc monthly users for a few years.. from a seemingly pretty basic game design &amp; platform, too)..&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Bye bye Titan. Guess it's time for Blizz to take a long hard look at WoW because the cow certainly doesn't seem like it's going to make it that far (to 2016) or that much further in general actually. Can't imagine them squeezing much more than two more (serious) expansions out of WoW, not at the rate they're going anyways.<br />
<br />
Well that's definitely atleast 3 more WoW expansions.<br />
2014, 2015 and 2016. [..]<br />
<br />
Oh yea man definitely doesn't look like releasing expansions gives them record box sales &amp; 1-2M sub jump (for a short time) to stem that constant subscriber loss, every single time they release one.. (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1300436-Calling-it-now!-Emerald-Dream-South-seas-X-Pack!?p=21179688#post21179688) So most likely, no way we can have more than 2 additional expansions now.. yea.. (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1279177-Complete-Blizzard-Development-Timeline-Speculation-2013-2025)<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off ;p<br />
<br />
@ Kuthe ~&gt; Only 3 ?? &amp; Released this close to each other..?? Their WoW Dev cycles have gotten much faster/tighter lately, but not quite that tight.. 16-18-Month release cycles is about as fast as they can get, under present standards of quality/polish.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can very easily wait for something when I don't know what it is.<br />
<br />
Don't mind the delay. As they say, they're not making pizzas.<br />

Just more vaporware (i.e. purposely announcing a product several years in advance with no details whatsoever in order to hurt potential competition). Think about how many competitors were basing their business model off of competing with a big Blizzard release of a new IP in the very near future only to find out that they were getting had.</div></div><hr />

Last game Jay Wilson was in, took five of &quot;QUALITY&quot; to release THAT CRAP.<br />
<br />
What worries me most is the &quot;RESET&quot; speech. It's not a delay, it's not an improvement. It's a RESET. The SAME FREAKING CRAP they did more than once in Diablo 3.<br />
