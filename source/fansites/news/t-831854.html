Patch 4.0.6 PTR Notes - January 14 Update<br />
It's a bird? It's a plane? No! It's another PTR Notes Update! If you're looking for me, I'll be leveling my warlock. <br />
<br />
For those of you asking, Honor Trade Goods vendors are on PTRs but they don't have any item for sale, we'll have to wait for the next PTR build to get a list of prices I guess. (or a blue post, maybe)<br />
Guilds<br />
<br />
Once a guild hits level 23, the daily cap on experience gained is removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Racials<br />
<br />
The gnomish racial trait Escape Artist now has a 1.5-minute cooldown, down from 1.75. In addition, it is now possible to use and waste this ability when not snared or rooted. This is consistent with other dispels.<br />

Balance<br />
<br />
Fungal growth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/78789/fungal-growth/) duration has been increased to 20 seconds, up from 10. In addition, it should now be much more responsive when detonating Wild Mushrooms (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77765/wild-mushroom/).<br />
Moonkin Form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/24858/moonkin-form/) now grants 15% damage reduction instead of increased armor.<br />
Starfall (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48505/starfall/) will no longer strike targets that are not in combat and will now drop stars at a slightly faster rate.<br />
Wild Mushroom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77765/wild-mushroom/) is now instant cast, down from 0.5 seconds. In addition, the radius of detonation has been increased to 6 yards, up from 3, and damage done increased by 30%.<br />

Casting Trap Launcher (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77769/trap-launcher/), Distracting Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20736/distracting-shot/), and Scare Beast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1513/scare-beast/) now cancel Auto Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75/auto-shot/) when cast. This is to make it easier to crowd control creatures with Auto Shot while moving enabled.<br />

Mind Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8092/mind-blast/) damage has been significantly increased. It should be roughly 50% greater than Mind Spike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73510/mind-spike/).<br />

<br />
Fel Armor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/28176/fel-armor/) has been redesigned. It now surrounds the caster with fel energy, increasing spell power and causing the warlock to be healed for 3% of any single-target spell damage he or she deals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonology<br />
<br />
Demonic Aegis (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30144/demonic-aegis/) now increases the healing effect of Fel Armor by 50/100%.<br />

Slam (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1464/slam/) weapon damage percent (at level 80+) has been increased from 125% to 145%.<br />

<br />
Fury<br />

In addition to its current effects, Bloodsurge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/46915/bloodsurge/) now also causes the next Slam (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1464/slam/) to deal 20% more damage.<br />

<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
<br />
Mystic Cogwheel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/68660/mystic-cogwheel/) is a new Engineering Cogwheel gem which provides resilience rating and can be purchased from the Engineering vendor for 55 Honor Points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The Honor Commodities and Justice Commodities Vendors now sell raw tradeskill materials. These are not intended to be a cost-effective source of these materials, but an option for players with lots of Justice or Honor Points who have already purchased all of the gear that interests them.<br />
Lich King trinkets with bonus armor values have been adjusted using the new Cataclysm formula, reducing their armor values substantially.<br />
<br />
<br />
Set Bonuses<br />
<br />
The PvE hunter 4-piece set bonus has been redesigned. It now reduces the cast time of Steady Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56641/steady-shot/) and Cobra Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77767/cobra-shot/) by .2 seconds.<br />
All PvP 4-piece bonuses have had their flat stat values cut in half. Primary stats are very powerful in Cataclysm, so much so that players were considering using PvP gear in PvE just because of these primary stat bonuses.<br />
PvP hunter bonus change reverted<br />
PvP enchants are properly valued and attached to Honor Quartermasters and Tol Barad/Baradin Hold Quartermasters.<br />
<br />

/cancelauras and addons<br />
The patch note specifically refers to addons. A while back, we blocked addons from automatically (meaning without players pushing a button) removing auras. Our logic was that canceling auras should be a player decision and require player action. To be honest, we don’t want canceling auras to be a huge part of the game period, but it has some niche uses mostly among high-end players and we are okay with that.<br />
<br />
In any case, what the patch note refers to is that addons can now cancel auras automatically outside of combat. Outside of combat, players are just using it for convenience and not for any kind of combat benefit. In this sense it is a buff not a nerf, but either way players can still use /cancelaura for their own personal macros – they just have to hit the button.<br />
<br />
I'm probably just going to remove the Addon section from the patch notes. Those notes really only make sense to addon authors, and we have a direct line of communication with most of them where we can share any changes from 4.0.6 which may affect how they create/update mods.

The below post is correct. We will share additional information with you regarding our plans for Balance as soon as we can, though it'll probably have to wait until after the holiday weekend.<br />

Making Chakra a Stance<br />
We do see this a lot and understand why players find the idea so appealing -- it'd be incredibly effective to shift effortlessly between AoE or single-target healing at the push of a button. But if we were to go that route, why have Chakra at all? Holy priests might as well have both bonuses as passive effects because there's no real commitment.<br />
<br />
The intent of Chakra is that you commit to single-target or AoE healing. It provides a meaningful choice where you need to use your knowledge of an encounter and coordinate with other players, as well as draw upon your experience and gut instinct as a priest. At the same time, it's not a permanent commitment the way choosing between Disc and Holy is locked in during combat. If you picked the wrong Chakra, or the situation changes, you don’t have to wait that long to switch. It’s also possible to use AoE spells during the single-target mode – you’re just not using your full bonus.

Leaders of the Horde and the Alliance, an Epic Short Fiction Series Continues….<br />
King Varian Wrynn, Queen Sylvanas Windrunner, King Genn Greymane, and Trade Prince Gallywix—these are just a few of the leaders who continue to shape Azeroth's destiny. They are the embodiments of their races' strongest traits... and at times their greatest failings. In the coming months, Blizzard Entertainment will be releasing short stories that will peer into the hearts of these legendary heroes and offer insight into what new trials might lie ahead as they lead their people in a world forever changed by the Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
The second story of this exciting series, &quot;Lord of His Pack (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm/features/genngreymane.html)&quot; gazes into the mind of Genn Greymane, the strong-willed king of Gilneas. When his nation falls to the Forsaken, Genn and his fellow citizens set out across the perilous seas to find sanctuary with their night elf allies. It soon becomes apparent that the recent Cataclysm has not only ravaged the lands of Azeroth, but its oceans as well.<br />
<br />
In the midst of a great tempest threatening to tear the struggling fleet apart, the events that led to the loss of Genn's kingdom haunt him mercilessly. To weather both storms, Genn must come to terms with his past choices and face their results in his present.</div></div><hr />

It was overpowered (Averaged out to 96 stats). This nerf will bring it in line with other profession bonuses (80 stats). The nerf was justified. Be glad you're actually getting a str/agil bonus from engi at all.<br />

Hi Tavek, after doing heroics repeatedly since wotlk I believe that the reports of warriors doing insane damage are from players who can.. well, play. Other warriors wearing several epic items doing 5k dps on packs where they can cleave their heart out need these buffs, I hope that clears up any confusion you have.</div></div><hr />

I'm seeing heroic geared warriors quite comfortably doing over 10k dps on whatever trash / boss you care to pull in heroics. Any half decently geared warrior doing 5k dps really doesn't have a clue what he is doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was due to the huge buff that was given to Raging Blow which lead to people managing to get it to hit for over 140k, they look to have scaled it back down significantly (they brought it up to 145% recently on the PTR) in this most recent update. They've finally gotten around to buffing Slam, like people have been telling them to do since 4.0.1 hit, as a likely method of distributing the damage elsewhere to a decent buff, especially for Fury to where maybe now we'll start using it over Bloodthirst when Bloodsurge procs... Maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Looks like I've been missing out the last couple days, seems people have been managing to get Raging Blow to hit for 300k. O_O Also, yes, the Slam buff should be nice...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, when you're removed from a guild you shouldn't have a time limit to rejoin. 1000 people for a guild is really not that much, so people start kicking people who haven't been active in a month. Usually those people come back in a few months, so that means all that work they did is gone, when they come back. If you ask me, that's bullshit.<br />
<br />
Also doubling the gold rewards from greys is nice, since arch is so soulcrushing. What really needs to happen to archaeology instead is these things: !!!<br />
<br />
If the game sees you've completed a race, you should not have that race come up ever again. If they add things in the future, then the game can drop the race back into the queue. I finished all commons and fossil rares in 15 solves. Why am I getting a ton of these when I'm done?<br />
<br />
Tolvir and Nerubian sites need to come up in the queue more often, especially since there are extremely less of those zones than everything else in the game.<br />
<br />
Going to a dig site should not take 5 minutes of readjustment to find those three 3 sites in the dig giving you 3 fragments each time you need for a project that requires 150 of them. If you're going to do that shit at least fucking give a reward to being 525 in the profession by going &quot;by being a master archaeologist, you're able to better understand ancient cultures giving you a chance to find extra fragments on pickup&quot;<br />
<br />
The blue rewards are pretty awful and even for someone (me) who loves vanity items I'd just assume vendor most of these stupid gimmick shitty &quot;oh well you can see a dwarven riverdance for 30 seconds&quot;. Wow. That was so fucking worth the hours I put into it. At least give something we can use for fucks sake! Make the BtA items level with the user so you actually use it! Make the gimmicks not have such a low timer rate and high cooldown!<br />
<br />
So far, I have spent maybe 50 hours in this garbage, and all I have to show for it is some lameass blues, a fossil pet, fossil mount, a helm I can't use because my shaman is level 16, an axe my rogue can't use because she's level 28, a dress my mage can't use because she's level 80 not 60, oh and I have Ring of the Boy Emperor, a BtA level 85 ring I can't use because my mage isn't 85. The only things I want are zin rokh (maybe) and the mount and pet from tolvir. Maybe the naga and sithilid transformations but not really.<br />
<br />
Basically yeah I'm frustrated at how soulcrushing they've made this. If it wasn't for the fact I was doing other things while doing this, I'd have to say this is the absolute worst grind in the entire game.</div></div><hr />

This i don't like. Having extra armor helps when you get extra mobs on you and gives you time to CC or barkskin or just run away. Making boomkins squishies is no fun. IDC about this in PvP but in PvE i better have all the survivability in the world. Make it 50% damage reduction and it will be good.<br />

Too much work. It'd mean they have to design 10 new matching sets of items and they don't feel like doing that.<br />
<br />
Sarcasm aside, I always wondered why they took Dungeon Sets out in wrath. I liked them a lot.<br />
<br />
Edit: And yes, I agree with Nathiest. I will continue only using Divine Storm for clearing packs of trash when soloing. As it is right now, with our main nuke based off Holy Power, Divine Storm is not too user-friendly. If it gave a guaranteed Holy Power, I'd be happy, regardless of the damage it does. But it doesn't.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually just referring to the Justice Point sets that already exist. They could just make a generic bonus for each that applies to all classes that cross over (like +150 agi on the hunter/enh shaman mail to match the pvp set bonus post-nerf)<br />
<br />
It'd solve the issue of pvp gear being used in pve fairly swiftly. (though personally I think the pvp set for my class is far prettier than that blue set, and that's part of why I went and did so.)<br />
<br />
And I'm puzzled why they removed them, too. I loved the concept of them, and I do think that it makes plenty of sense to have a pre-raid &quot;tier&quot; with bonuses for putting in the effort to collect them..</div></div><hr />

If Blizz make all 3 mushrooms to be single cast (with a CD).Its pointless casting them on 3 diffrent places when you must blow all at the same time.If Mushrooms have auto triger mehanics like hunters traps and alow us to target them so we actually can have some real benefit from Fungal Growth.Then this gona work</div></div><hr />

Warriors have it in their stances ( even if it looks different) Druids with their shapes and DK with their pressences, we can argue that paladins have it aswel, but their's so weak it's not worth to mention ;)</div></div><hr />

It's like killing arms warrior PvP because they probably didn't realize that their fail changes to charge put it on DR with itself. :confused:<br />
The nerf frost mages deep freeze damage? This only nerfs PvE damage where frost is already below par. :mad:<br />
<br />
Blizzard is so clueless about its own game, it's not funny any more. They should axe Ghostcrawler before this game goes totaly down the drain. <br />
If I have to read another blog entry by him defending the Tol Barad design I will have to puke<br />
<br />
Kalgan is in charge of PvP. He should get the axe! HTF can blizz keep a retarded fish-frog like him employed for 6 years?!?!?....and they even promoted him....WTF!??!?!?!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would love to hear the reasoning behind that....<br />
<br />
Likely because once you're leveling through 23 and 24, it takes so much exp that the rate cap stops being necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The sell value of all common artifacts has been doubled, while a small subset of common artifacts have had their sell value increased far beyond that.<br />

Of course, its kinda repeatitive, and the process of getting to random digsites sucks, but thats not the point.<br />
<br />
The only thing im learning about lore. And I like the lore. Is digging it up sucks. Its boring, repetetive, and the mechanic sucks. It has to be possible to make it interesting. say Clues? or something.</div></div><hr />
