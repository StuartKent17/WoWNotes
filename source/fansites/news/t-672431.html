<br />
General<br />
Dazed: Creatures attacking a player from behind can no longer cause players level 1-5 to be dazed, and have a reduced chance to cause players level 6-10 to be dazed.<br />
The existing /welcome emote now greets/welcomes targets (character says “hello”), while the new /yw is for saying &quot;you're welcome.&quot;<br />
Many of the tail sweeps with knockback effects will no longer hit players’ pets.<br />
Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel<br />
The Forge of Souls and Pit of Saron in the 5-player dungeon are currently available for testing.<br />
Additional Icecrown Citadel dungeon and raid content will be made available in future test builds. For more information and testing schedules please visit our Test Realm forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11572&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
Area-of-Effect Damage Caps: We’ve redesigned the way area damage is capped when hitting many targets. Instead of a hard cap on total damage done, the game now caps the total damage done at a value equal to the damage the spell would do if it hit 10 targets. In other words, if a spell does 1000 damage to each target, it would hit up to 10 targets for 1000 each, but with more than 10 targets, each target would take 1000 damage divided by the number of targets. 20 targets would be hit for 500 damage each in that example.<br />
Default Equipment: Starting weapons are now more uniform. Rogues now start with a pair of daggers equipped. All other classes except shamans start with a 2-handed weapon equipped and the required skill already known. Shamans start with a 1-handed weapon and a shield, as they benefit more from the shield than they would from a 2-handed weapon.<br />
Glancing Blows: The mage, warlock, and priest classes no longer have an increased chance for their melee attacks to be glancing blows; and the damage penalty due to their glancing blows is the same as for other classes.<br />
Health and Mana Regeneration: These regeneration rates have been increased by up to 200% for low level characters. As a player’s level increases, the regeneration rates gradually reduce, returning to normal rates at level 15.<br />
Pet Resilience: All player pets now get 100% of their master’s resilience.<br />
Spell Mana Costs: These costs have been reduced for almost all lower level spell ranks. In general, if a spell decreased in cost with a higher level rank in patch 3.2.0, that spell now has the decreased cost at all ranks. In addition, spells learned before level 20 with reduced cast times and/or durations have even further reduced mana costs, proportionate to their reduction in cast time or damage.<br />
Taunt Diminishing Returns: We’ve revised the system for diminishing returns on Taunt so that creatures do not become immune to Taunt until after 5 Taunts have landed. The duration of the Taunt effect will be reduced by 35% instead of 50% for each taunt landed. In addition, most creatures in the world will not be affected by Taunt diminishing returns at all. Creatures will only have Taunt diminishing returns if they have been specifically flagged for that behavior based on the design of a given encounter.<br />
<br />
Races: General<br />
Orc and troll shamans now have their own unique totem art.<br />
Racial Attribute Bonuses: These bonuses have been recalibrated to even out the amount of starting health on the various races. All races start with a standardized level of stamina, except for orcs, dwarves, and tauren who now start with 1 extra point of stamina. For each class, bonuses and penalties to all attributes have been adjusted so that each race has an equal attribute total.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
Battleground Experience: Battleground experience gained is now based on the level of the player gaining experience, rather than the highest possible player level in that Battleground.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle: There is now a 1-handed version of this rune in addition to the current 2-handed rune.<br />
<br />
Unholy<br />
Night of the Dead: Now reduces the damage your pet takes from area-of-effect damage by 45/90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
Scourge Strike: Redesigned. The base ability now deals 50% weapon damage plus an additional amount as physical damage. However, for each disease the death knight has on the target, the target will take additional shadow damage equal to 25% of the physical damage done.<br />
Unholy Blight: This talent now deals only 10% of Death Coil damage as a damage-over-time effect on the target.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Prowl: This ability no longer has multiple ranks and penalizes movement speed by 30%.<br />
Rejuvenation: Rank 15 of this spell was providing a 15-second duration. It has been correctly reduced to 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pets take from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Call Stabled Pet: Cooldown reduced from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.<br />
Deterrence: Now also increases the chance for ranged attacks to miss the hunter by 100% while under its effect.<br />
Misdirection: Redesigned. Instead of having finite charges, it now begins a 4-second timer when the hunter using Misdirection performs a threat-generating attack, during which all threat generated by the hunter goes to the friendly target. In addition, multiple hunters can now misdirect threat to the same friendly target simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery<br />
Intimidation: If the hunter’s pet is in melee range of its target, the stun from Intimidation will now be applied immediately instead of on the pet’s next swing or attack.<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance: This talent has been replaced by Culling the Herd. Hunter pets now innately take 90% less damage from area-of-effect abilities like all other class pets. This does not apply to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
Cower: Redesigned. This ability no longer affects threat, and instead reduces damage taken by the pet by 40% for 6 seconds with a 45-second cooldown. While cowering, the pet’s movement speed is 50% of normal speed. Cower now only has a single rank and is available at pet level 20.<br />
Culling the Herd: This pet talent has replaced the Avoidance talent in the pet trees (Hunter pets now gain that benefit automatically without expenditure of talent points). Culling the Herd increases pet and hunter damage by 1/2/3% for 10 seconds each time the pet deals a critical strike with Claw, Bite, or Smack.<br />
Demoralizing Screech: The attack power reduction from this ability has been increased by 40%, equaling the maximum possible attack power reduction from the abilities of other classes.<br />
Improved Cower: Redesigned. This ability now reduces the movement penalty of Cower by 50%/100%.<br />
Venom Web Spray: Range increased from 20 yards to 30 yards.<br />
Web: Range increased from 20 yards to 30 yards.<br />
Wolverine Bite: This talent is now enabled when the pet lands a critical strike rather than from the target dodging the pet’s attacks. In addition, this talent no longer has a prerequisite.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Arcane<br />
Arcane Empowerment: This talent now also grants 1/2/3% increased damage done by the mage’s party or raid for 10 seconds after the mage gets a critical strike with Arcane Explosion, Arcane Missiles, Arcane Barrage, or Arcane Blast. This effect is exclusive with Ferocious Inspiration and Sanctified Retribution.<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pets take from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Protection<br />
Divine Guardian: This talent no longer increases the amount of damage transferred to the paladin from Divine Sacrifice. Instead it causes all raid and party members to take 10/20% reduced damage while Divine Sacrifice is active.<br />
Divine Sacrifice: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now limited to 40% of the paladin’s health multiplied by the number of party members. In addition, the damage transferred to the paladin is now reduced by 50% before being applied to the paladin. Finally, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been fixed. Divine Sacrifice will now cancel as soon as its maximum damage value is exceeded in all cases.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Shadow<br />
Mind Flay: The range of this ability has been increased to 30 yards, up from 20.<br />
<br />
Pet<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pet takes from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Dual Wield: Rogues now know this ability upon logging into the game at level 1.<br />
Stealth: This ability no longer has multiple ranks. While active, the single rank of this ability (available at level 1) allows rogues to move at 70% movement speed.<br />
Vanish: For the first half second after this ability is used, neither Vanish nor Stealth can be broken by taking damage or being the victim of a hostile spell or ability.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
Affliction<br />
Improved Felhunter: This talent now also reduces the cooldown on the felhunter’s Shadow Bite ability by 2/4 seconds.<br />
<br />
Demonology<br />
Decimation: Redesigned. When Shadowbolt, Incinerate or Soul Fire hit a target that is at or below 35% health, the cast time of Soul Fire is reduced by 30/60% for 8 seconds. Soul Fires cast under the effect of Decimation cost no shards.<br />
Demonic Pact: This talent now also increases the warlock's spell damage by 1/2/3/4/5%.<br />
<br />
Destruction<br />
Conflagrate: Redesigned. This talent now consumes an Immolate or Shadowflame effect on the enemy target to instantly deal damage equal to 9 seconds of Immolate or 8 seconds of Shadowflame, and causes additional damage over 3 seconds equal to 3 seconds of Immolate or 2 seconds of Shadowflame.<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pets take from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
Doomguard/Infernal: These pets now innately have Avoidance like all other warlock pets.<br />
Shadow Bite: This pet ability now provides 15% increased damage for each of the warlock’s damage-over-time effects on the target.<br />
Summon Imp: This ability is now available from the trainer for level 1 warlocks and no longer requires a quest to learn.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
Victory Rush: This ability is now trainable at level 6.<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
Damage Shield: This ability will no longer trigger any chance-on-hit effects from the warrior or the opponent it damages.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
Enchant Weapon - Black Magic: This enchantment now sometimes increases haste rating for the caster rather than inflicting the caster’s target with a damage-over-time effect. It is also now triggered by landing any harmful spell rather than inflicting damage with a spell.<br />
Enchant Weapon - Unholy: This enchantment now inflicts Shadow damage in addition to its original effect.<br />
<br />
First Aid<br />
The training costs for most bandages have been reduced.<br />
<br />
Mining<br />
Enchanted Thorium: This ability now uses the Mining skill and is learned from trainers at a skill level of 250.<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Weekly raid quests are now available from Archmage Lan'dalock in Dalaran. Every Tuesday at 3 AM the Council of Six will choose a different strategic target that must die from either: The Obsidian Sanctum, Naxxramas, The Eye of Eternity, Ulduar, Trial of the Crusader, or Icecrown Citadel.<br />
For the various Icecrown Bomber quests at Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate, players can now choose to eject from their bomber seats mid-run. If you do so, a rescue vehicle will transport your character back to the safety of your infra-green platform.<br />
Azure Drakes and Dragons will now attack back when attacked by characters not riding Wyrmrest Defenders.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Death Knight Tier-9 4-Piece Bonus: This set bonus no longer grants Frost Fever a chance to be a critical strike. It still grants that possibility to Blood Plague.<br />
<br />
Glyphs<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Glyph of Icy Touch: Instead of granting additional runic power, this glyph now causes Frost Fever to deal 20% additional damage.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Glyph of Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Glyph of Fire Nova. This glyph now reduces the cooldown of Fire Nova by 3 seconds.<br />
<br />

<br />
Classes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Infected Wounds: This ability is no longer considered to be in the magical defense category; therefore spell hit no longer applies to its activation.<br />
Nature's Grace: The tooltip now correctly indicates that it will not be activated from periodic spell critical strikes.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Concussive Barrage: This ability is no longer subject to spell reflects.<br />

<br />

Inspiration: The tooltip now correctly indicates that it also functions with Prayer of Mending.<br />
Mind Flay: The rank 1 tooltip has been corrected to indicate the accurate damage and snare effect.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
Curse of the Elements: Rank 4 has been increased to 11%, up from 10%.<br />
Drain Soul: This spell now deals 4 times the normal damage for all ranks. Previously it was only ranks 6 and above.<br />
Suffering (Voidwalker): Ranks 5-8 had the incorrect taunt radius of 5 yards and have all been adjusted to a 10-yard radius.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Unholy DKs are looking good,&quot;<br />
&quot;But what about ret paladins?&quot;<br />
&quot;What about ret pallys?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ret paladins aren't getting enough gear the DKs are taking it!11!11&quot;<br />
&quot;Lets Homogenize it to be the same as blood!&quot; <br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
On the subject of the FF glyph, why not just have a Double-barrel'd Glyph something like Increase the damage of your Frost fever and blood plague by~ 7-10% would be more rounded and a good use of not nerfing bonuses ect.</div></div><hr />

Keyword: spells. Rogue AOE was never capped and still isn't (a good illustration would be Onyxia's whelps) but spells like Arcane Explosion, Hellfire and the like had ridiculously low damage caps that rendered any bonus spell power useless to more than ten enemies when more than 800 spell power was obtained.<br />
<br />
Example: Arcane Explosion, pre-3.3, has a damage cap of ~35k.<br />
<br />
A new standard AoE pull has 40 enemies. On average, an ArcExp hit deals 560 damage before spellpower and talents. That's 22400k damage. Suppose said mage has 2000 spell power. 2000 * .2128 = 425 after being rounded down. Arcane Explosion would now deal 985 non-crit damage to each enemy, again, before talents. 985 * 40 = 39400. However, the damage over 35k is ignored, so 35k is now divided amongst those 40 targets, leaving 875 per hit. This means some of that 2000 spell power is now being WASTED.<br />
<br />
The change now makes spells less effective against fewer targets, but damage is no longer capped.</div></div><hr />

Heck with divine sacrifice being party wide, it means that if I (the tank) am in a party with people unlikely to take damage, I can actually pop divine sacrifice to trigger Guardian for the rest of the raid. It would be most interesting for holy ofc, if only they actually had enough talents to pick in prot, but right now it looks like a waste and they are better off going for ret still.</div></div><hr />

I think it will do same damage.<br />
<br />
For example, 4k non crit will be now split into 3k burst and 1k over 3 sec<br />
and 8k crit will be split into 6k burst and 2k over 3 sec.<br />

It still takes a modest amount of spell power to reach the caps on exotic pulls such as Onyxia whelps, Ulduar multi-pull comedy, or taking the whole instance with you when doing strat farming runs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the current hard cap for AoE is, so I'm wondering if this new change is a detriment or an improvement.<br />
<br />
It's a huge detriment to pulls where you aren't supposed to be AOEing (such as taking an entire room of Naxx mobs) in which you have fewer than 20 mobs to hit, but obvious AoE situations such as whelps and possibly waves of Scourge zombies in ICC aren't going to have AoE spells hit the cap.<br />
<br />
Fan of Knives isn't going to be affected, but on average you can activate it only every 4 and a half seconds and encounter design and netcode isn't going to allow a situation where it'd be superior to casting AoE.</div></div><hr />

In any way. I'm trying to say if you want difficulty don't complain about normal modes PERIOD. They're easy for a reason *cough bads*. Also, the idea of a few challenging and many easy has been in since BC, remember 2.3 and the gigantic amounts of 4/5 4/9 guilds that only spawned because Kael and Vashj were no longer needed? I do agree there should be more challenging encounters though - but do it through mechanics and not &quot;X HITS HARDER ON HEROICS!&quot;.<br />
<br />
*sigh* I miss BC style cockblocks. I'd love for Bolvar/Saurfang/WhoeverIceCrown'sDKBossIs to be super hard in the sense it requires every raid member to not fail, similar to Archi.<br />
<br />
Editz: I probably shouldn't be posting this tired, bit dilusional.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normal mode indeed means nothing. I was responding to the way you told him to link the achievements for those certain bosses which has frankly been something being word to word repeated whenever someone brings up the game difficulty as a topic. Concentrating on assuming an amount of bosses possible to be counted with the fingers of one hand that are actually challenging to a very big part of the player base means it doesn't matter how the rest is balanced is just something I find delusional when it's brought up over and over again.<br />
<br />
The ideal is a bell curve.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to &quot;attack&quot; you with this as you brought the discussion bit away from that in your following posts. It was just that first post of yours.</div></div><hr />

And because Divine Sacrifice only absorbs 30% per tick (they don't change that i think) it means that my party members would have to take 3.33x 160% of my hp (533%) before the effect expires. So with my 25k hp my group members would have to take 130k dmg before it expires, and I don't think that often that kind of damage is coming within 10 seconds, so ds would be up for the whole duration most of the time. Hopefully people would understand even half what I'm trying to say.<br />

<br />
sorry destro. no more instagibbing everything around you. not so much a pve dps loss but a nerf in the ability to execute in pvp. which is understandable I suppose. double critting for 12-13k each in the span of 2 seconds with cb and conflag has made skill less of a factor in getting a kill.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keoren</div><div class="date">2009-10-08, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm just too tired to apply logic to any given sentence. Unfortunatly the bell curve hasn't really been applied in my eyes since... well... ever. See: Vashj&gt;Kael&gt;Hyjal. Hard goes to harder goes to easy as piss. Bit of an extreme example but you get the idea. Also - how &quot;hard&quot; toc10 is compared to the bosses of uld10 (both norm). Seems to go a step backwards. It would be pretty awesome if they could master the curve in a way that we would see progressive difficulty, but I think thats a bit beyond what Blizzard are capable of whilst retaining content viewable by the entire customer base ._.<br />
<br />
*wishes it could and would be applied*<br />
<br />
Edit: a true bell curve would mean the intermediate content would be harder than the final wouldn't it? Might need to add in some limits, heh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, ToC seems more like a soft gear reset to get everyone prepared for Icecrown instead of a progression continuation for Ulduar.<br />
<br />
As for bell curve, if the content would increase in difficulty in a steadily rising &quot;line&quot;, humans themselves would create the curve. Majority of the people would be around the middle area of progression. <br />
<br />
The way bell curve could work in WoW would be to have the normal progression as easy as ever (because that is what seems to be the devs' ideal) with hard modes keeping on picking up from where the last hard modes in the previous raid ended, creating the true progression. I'm saying the last &quot;hard modes&quot;, because I think 1-4 &quot;teaser&quot; or &quot;reward&quot; hard modes that are harder than the first hard modes of the next tier are healthy for a raid and overall progression. Otherwise we would either only start facing truly challenging hard modes in the second last and last raids or all the hard modes should be more balanced around challenging the gear instead of the players.<br />
<br />
When I look at Ulduar and ToC hard modes, I don't think the curve has been that much off, because ToC also brings the efficiency aspect into play. One thing that, however, has gone wrong is easening the curve bit too much. For example Vezax hard mode was made way too forgiving compared to its previous state, unless the devs wanted to bring another ladder to lower-middle-end hard modes. In my honest opinion, the state of the high-end Ulduar hard modes pre-nerf was quite promising and hit the right spots with an encounter being just slightly easier than another, but harder than another. It had its flaws like the big leap to Yogg0 which had its flaws of supporting certain classes and rng (depending on tactic) bit too much, but overall not bad.<br />
<br />
I guess that comes also down to whether you want the curve to last from the first raid to the last or basically reset with each raid that becomes current content.</div></div><hr />

For the various Icecrown Bomber quests at Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate, players can now choose to eject from their bomber seats mid-run. If you do so, a rescue vehicle will transport your character back to the safety of your infra-green platform.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fex</div><div class="date">2009-10-08, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Divine Sacrifice change is a bit of a two-edged sword for me. It's always wierd to see PvE nerfs with PvP ramifications, but in this case, it's a good thing.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, as a holy paladin, I loved being able to provide the raid with BubbleSac in a pinch (Anub-Heroic P3, for example). It was nice to have a raidwide ability that was almost as desirable as, say, Heroism.<br />
<br />
The new effect is unarguably better for those affected, but the fact that it is party-only is irritating (as all party-specific buffs are) - not necessarily because it affects fewer people, but because party-specific buffs are a hassle to manage. With a little bit of clever raid positioning, though, I'm sure that the new effect will be put to good use. I definitely believe that prot will still be the sub-tree of choice for holy paladins, over ret.<br />
<br />
And of course, on the other hand, the new Divine Sacrifice is going to be amazing in PvP. Popping Divine Sacrifice early on in 5v5 (or even 3v3, depending on the comp) is always a risky move without Bubble, since there's a pretty legitimate chance you'll put yourself in a dangerous position with all of the redirected damage. The new built-in reduction mechanic means that a portion of the redirected damage simply disappears, and the larger health cap (120% in 3's and 200% in 5's) should help DSac from falling off early, leaving you open to CC. Every little bit of mitigation helps - especially when it doesn't trigger Forbearance.</div></div><hr />

Protection<br />
Divine Guardian: This talent no longer increases the amount of damage transferred to the paladin from Divine Sacrifice. Instead it causes all raid and party members to take 10/20% reduced damage while Divine Sacrifice is active.<br />
Divine Sacrifice: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now limited to 40% of the paladin’s health multiplied by the number of party members. In addition, the damage transferred to the paladin is now reduced by 50% before being applied to the paladin. Finally, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been fixed. Divine Sacrifice will now cancel as soon as its maximum damage value is exceeded in all cases.<br />

Ouch. :'(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love Unholy, I've loved it since Wrath hit. And like everything that is new in this game, it was complained about, over, and over, and over, and FUCKING over. The nerfs post 3.0 that happened needed to happen, hybrid specs kind of strike me as cheating. But ever since then, players would whine, and then our tree's would get cluster-fucked, especially unholy.<br />
<br />
Hey Unholy DK's, we're going change Unholy Blight so you have some good single target!<br />
<br />
DK's: Thanks blizz!<br />
<br />
Btw, it sucks.<br />
<br />
And thennnnn,<br />
<br />
Hey Unholy Dk's, we're nerfing Scourge Strike to the ground, you have to use Obliterate now and get armor pen gear!<br />
<br />
So I took it with a smile and started accumulating armor penetration, but it was followed by this:<br />
<br />
Hey Unholy DK's, we're bringing Scourge Strike back, all that armor pen gear isn't worth shit for you now!<br />
<br />
So I've replaced it with good ole' haste.<br />
<br />
And NOW.<br />
<br />
Hey Unholy DK's, we're changing Scourge Strike to physical damage, GET MOAR ARMOR PENZ<br />
<br />
Honestly?<br />
<br />
I don't care if we need armor pen, or if we don't, but WHY THE FUCK can't you developers make up your mind? Now when ICC hits, I'm going to do mediocre damage for at least a month while I try to get new gear. Every damn patch has completely turned the Unholy tree upside down, everytime we get something worthwhile it gets ruined in a month. Thanks for nerfing unholy blight, guess I can fill out desolation and dark conviction since it won't be worth a damn now, when it wasn't that great anyway. SS will probably hit a lot harder, but why rejoice when the trend shows it won't be that way for long?<br />
<br />
I love playing a Death Knight, but rerolling has never looked so good. What's the point in balancing my gear/stats, dedicating time to be a good dps , looking up stat weights, strats, and trying to better my playstyle if every patch I have to start over?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In Onyxia I got Killing machine proc and used it to get 26 crits with howling blast on the whelps. It did over 100k damage. This change will probably make it do only 60-70k. This change will nerf everyone's traditional AoE damage, and just puch DK's farther ahead on AoE as pestillence is not a standard type of AoE.<br />
<br />
As for the 4-piece set bonus, I'm not bothered as this patch is released with the new raid instance, and the first thing I'm going to be doing is getting the 2-piece bonus from the next tier.</div></div><hr />

Rofl you do realize they removed the aoe affect from players and not npcs, as in your Bladestorms 3rd hit will most likely kill the pets anyways. Bad warrior is bad.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. Not to talk about them nerfing t9 4p bonus after finally have given unholy a nice place in the dps-frame. but nooo, they just couldnt let us have that fun. they want us to go back to that boring stinking piece of shit called bloodspecc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you can see, this patch 3.3 PTR notes was released in Oct 7, 2009. Contents include 2 ICC 5-mans only. So no Halls of Reflection and the ICC 10/25man instance. The Patch 3.3 was released Dec 8, 2009.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I think the developers for 4.3 is quite ahead in terms of content. Oct 13 patch notes contain 3 5-man dungeons and two (2) DragonSoul bosses. That's good news! That would mean that there is a possibility that Patch 4.3 may be released by end of November! or Thanksgiving weekend? Hurray! :)</div></div><hr />
