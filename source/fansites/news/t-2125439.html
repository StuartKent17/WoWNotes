Patch 7.1.5 - Legendary Vendor on the PTR<br />
You can hop onto the PTR and test out the new legendary items coming in Patch 7.1.5 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=23038&amp;filter-quality=32)!<br />

Mischief the Fel Kitty Delayed<br />
We were hoping it'd be available today, but don't worry folks, Mischief is coming soon! Keep an eye on the news page for when this fel kitty invades!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1.5 - Secondary Stat Changes<br />
The changes to secondary stat ratings in 7.1.5 have a few goals, and certain pieces are not yet in the current build.<br />
<br />
Goal 1: Increase the importance of item level as a guideline for upgrading items. Moreso than in the past, large item level increases are not a reliable indicator of an upgrade due to the variance in power of secondary stats on an item. Increasing the amount of rating that you need per percentage of a secondary stat tips the balance of an item’s power more heavily toward primary stat. We’re okay with very small item level upgrades being a tougher choice, but some specs are currently passing up 15+ item levels in favor of secondary stats. That shouldn’t be something players are encouraged to do – with the occasional exception on rings and necks, which brings us to our second goal.<br />
<br />
Goal 2: Improve rings and necks. The removal of primary stats from those slots on Legion gear means that your choices of secondary stats there are impactful, which we like. However, they still suffer from the problem of secondary stat distribution dominating the choice of which item to equip. We’ve increased how heavily item level affects the amount of stats on Legion rings and necks in 7.1.5, which will make significant item level jumps a clearer indicator of an upgrade on these slots. You’ll still find situations in which secondary stat choice is more important than item level for rings and necks, which is intentional; we’re just dialing it back a bit.<br />
<br />
Goal 3: Don’t lower player power. This is a key part of the overall strategy that isn’t yet complete. Right now, on the PTR, player power is definitely down a few percent compared to live. The next build will have changes that increase the total amount of stats given by all items above level 800 to account for this gap, such that the overall power of your equipped items should be about the same (if not slightly higher) than it is currently in 7.1. <br />
<br />
As you might expect, these changes will affect some classes more strongly than others. More overall character power will come from your primary stats than it did before, so all of your abilities will hit harder, even if they crit less or happen less frequently. Additionally, as we continue tuning for Patch 7.1.5, we’ll make adjustments as necessary on a spec-by-spec basis.<br />
<br />
Apologies if I'm reading this wrong. But it sounds like the plan is to make us require more of a secondary stat, then provide us a higher value of secondary stats on existing gear. Isn't this counterproductive or am I just derp?<br />
It's a tough bit of mathematical gymnastics that's tough to explain succinctly, but the long and the short of it is that the way that the item's primary stat (or sheer amount of secondary stats, in the case of rings and necks) make the higher-ilevel piece an upgrade more often.<br />
<br />
I think they need to look into specs that rely on extreme cases of secondary dependence and adjust those specs accordingly. This blanket nerf is going to cause more problems.<br />
That's what I was getting at in the last paragraph <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1.5 Feedback - Survival Hunter<br />
Sorry for the delay in replying to this. Long story short, we agree with the concerns laid out in this thread: Waylay as a damage mechanic isn’t playing well, and the increased trap cooldown is a nerf that undermines other utility upgrades. We’ve been discussing exactly what we want to do about it, and can share some details:<br />
<br />
For starters, the Trap cooldown is going back to a baseline of 30 seconds, just like it is in Patch 7.1. We had initially increased it to 40 based on some concerns that Hunter crowd control might end up too powerful in some situations, but after further consideration, we don’t think that’ll be necessary.<br />
<br />
Regarding Waylay, the original intent of the passive was to reinforce Survival’s niche as trap experts (especially with other Hunter specializations getting traps again) by rewarding clever placement of traps when you’re able to anticipate your enemy’s movement. After all, the very nature of a trap is a hazard set ahead of time for an unsuspecting victim, whereas traps today often end up feeling more like lobbed explosives. However, in group gameplay, the movement of your targets is largely outside of your direct control, and any sort of rotational damage benefit of Waylay is likely to be far more frustrating than fun. We’re going to remove the damage-increasing benefit that Waylay provided to Explosive Trap and let its bonuses focus purely on utility. With the Freezing Trap and Tar Trap cooldown now unchanged, this makes Waylay simply a new utility perk over what Survival has on live, and we’re excited about some of the potential ways Hunters can make use of it in both PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
As an aside (and this is relevant to all classes and specs), part of our goal to keep patches coming at a steady pace in Legion means that you’re likely to see more half-completed ideas and strange experiments on PTR than even veteran testers might be used to in previous expansions. Just because a change shows up in a PTR build does not mean that it’s something the team views as a final design (or even a design we’re necessarily happy with). This has been especially true with 7.1.5, and we’ve done a poor job of communicating that thus far. We’d like to apologize for that failing, and it’s something we’re actively working to correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Changes and Developer Notes<br />
To maybe give a little more hope, we had several meetings and discussions yesterday about ways to improve our internal processes so that we can converse more freely and immediately on in-development changes. Some of those improvements have already been made, and I'm personally hoping the difference will be noticeable over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
As a guy who works in Dev, the amount of reasons for silence, from &quot;We have no solution and don't want to bring it up without one&quot; to &quot;Policy to not talk about changes until finalized&quot;, is sometimes ludicrous.<br />
We've typically shied toward the former more than we probably need to. Historically we've wanted to be able to say how we're fixing an issue before we say anything, but I think that &quot;we're going to fix this, just haven't decided how yet&quot; is still a good message to get across in the meantime. <br />
<br />
Just a side suggestion: Why not follow the HotS, OW and SC model, and do small explanations with each change in the changelogs? Is it because there are just too many different specs in wow and too many changes for it to be viable?<br />
That's part of it. We typically do add those explanations for major hotfixes or release notes. Agree that we need more of that for PTR changes.<br />

Those specs have existed since Vanilla. Before a few months ago, no one thought to themselves, &quot;Hmmm.......I really like playing melee, maybe I'll play a hunter and one day hope they'll make one spec melee.&quot;<br />

I actually played my hunter as a melee/trap spec in vanilla (with most talents in Survival); was quite fun, 'though I do get what you mean.<br />
<br />
A tank spec for warlock would have been nice (Demo retuning; and thus semi-melee), but I think Vengeance has replaced that idea almost entirely. Could still work, however — if Blizzard wanted it to, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shuffled</div><div class="date">2016-12-02, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a mage and a mostly m+ player, and semi-retired mythic raider, I'm just becoming more and more disheartened with these changes as I read them. I had already cancelled my sub and was just playing out the month and a half I had left in hopes that the PTR and communication from blizzard just made me feel more at east about the direction the game was taken. As it stands I feel like, rotation wise, my class is going to feel less organic and fun. With the changes on PTR my crit has dropped to the point where I crit less often enough than I can often build fireblast charges without managing them. This makes the class feel like I'm constantly capping resources instead of managing cooldowns and building charges for a purpose (that fat combustion), and spend way too much time casting a filler spell that honestly does almost no substantial damage and therefore doesn't feel good. <br />
<br />
Add in the fact that the ability to deal with random mechanics is being shifted to a single legendary item and the devs are still completely silent on where when and how they are going to fix the RNGesus of legendaries and how not fun, punishing, and spec limiting the items are. Volcanic is going to feel insanely punishing as range, to the point where I wouldn't want to play more than my weekly 12 those weeks, unless I somehow gets those boots. I can't switch to frost or arcane because all my DPS legendaries (Bracers, which I was insanely lucky to get and Belt) are for the fire spec. Even if I switch there are like four I could get for any spec, and only 1 of those I actually want, and 1 I feel like I have to have despite not really wanting to use it in favor of others.<br />
<br />
Blizzard could have simply fixed fire mage by making Critical Mass give crit scaling on intellect vs the current flat crit (as it was long ago compared to now) instead of all these gymnastics they are doing to make certain secondaries (crit for mages) less important. I understand the damage buff that happened, but even after that fire mages have lost about 25% single target DPS (I've currently dropped 100k DPS at ilvl 876).<br />
<br />
I know PTR isn't over yet and there will be more changes, but I really don't like the direction things are going, I don't feel like the real problems players have with the game as it is are being addresses, and I don't think the changes that are being made amount to me having more fun. I have faith things might turn around for the better, but as it stands when my sub expires in about four weeks that is going to be it for me. I don't like these big changes being made with a total lack of communication, and I don't like how tight lipped they are about legendaries and how they are affecting the game given how obviously important they are.</div></div><hr />

This way you could change a +10 ilvl item with bad stats to a +10 ilvl item with better stats that improves your char over the old item.<br />
<br />
The real overhaul like less power from secondary stats would come with a new xpac - makes more sense IMHO...<br />
If you do different numbers now and they have to rebalance the stats again and again because of it, it would suck. Maybe you can't even balance them like they should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That and they added a new melee class the same expansion they decided to make one of the specs of one of the 3 purely ranged classes melee. Legion is melee overkill. <br />
<br />
Seriously, many many many many things in legion so far; while it's a fun expansion..to a point; it feels like they just had ideas and shoved them in with no forethought or fleshing out. Like the devs hands were forced by stock holders or investors who were gun-shy of another subscription loss so just shovel out content and fix it later.<br />

I don't remember seeing anywhere that people was complaining about reforging, socketing ect. Honestly it was much more exciting getting a crap higher ilvl piece of gear cause reforging would make it a slight upgrade, now getting a crap higher ilvl piece of gear is the same as getting trash loot. I just dont get why do all the work they are doing in 7.1.5 when they can just flick a switch bring back reforging and that would fix it for everyone. Their biggest thing in removing reforging was that when you get an upgrade that it feels better just to equip it and go on. Actually it makes no difference. When you get an upgrade you have already killed the boss without the gear so waiting until you reforge it enchant it and gem it was not a big deal and did not take away from my gaming experience!</div></div><hr />

Have you ever had an opinion that wasn't awful? I have never seen you say a positive thing, and yet you have been here for years, bitching every day. Go do something else if you're unhappy with literally goddamn everything, it's pathetic.<br />
<br />
I personally love the variety of having a melee spec, coming from a guy who has been a hunter since about two weeks after launch. A little variety never hurt anybody.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xcruiser</div><div class="date">2016-12-02, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With respect to Survival Hunters and the discussion here in the comments, I agree that adding a melee spec to the class I've purposely played for 10 years to get away from melee was an unwelcome change from my point of view. As others have said, the perfect storm of Demon Hunter being added, melee still being disproportionately punished by encounter mechanics, and changing one pure ranged DPS class' spec to melee, in aggregate, was a fundamentally flawed strategy.<br />
<br />
A potential solution, if Blizzard insisted on bringing back that type of functionality in the Survival role, would be making melee possible with an outlier combination of talents, similar to how it was with the original talent trees. Not mainstream, but certainly viable if you were curious enough to put that quirky mash-up of talents together. That would have been in the spirit of how Survival used to be without taking over a third of a ranged class' options. <br />

If traps are SUCH an issue of contention for the other two bereaved specs, and such a delicate tuning knob for SV, I say abandon traps altogether, give MM/BM back everything they desire (traps, pets, etc) and break a little flavor to make SV more Dragoon-centric, with jumping downward smashes, and leaping thrusts, whirlwind spear twirls.

Their goal is not to make characters weaker and make secondary stats less desireable, then they lower our ratings so we HAVE to get more secondary stats to get to the same level and with breakpoint specs this will be a fucking ordeal and we have to start gearing from scratch all over again ????? Profit. This change weill NEVER get us to equip an item 15 lvls above just because of primary stat, if it has useless stats, it doesnt go in the garbage now granted, but in to the bank to when we can get 3-4 more items of the same level so we can get THE FUCKING SAME values as we previously do in breakpoints. This whole idiotic thing will achieve exactly the opposite of what they think it will. Oh and what about dps requirements? Mythic ursoc needs a fair amount, not to mention freaking Guarm, I guess raiding just has to take a hiaetus until Blizzard sobers up.</div></div><hr />

Speak for yourself. I am overwhelmingly happy that Blizzard brought back melee abilities for hunters after literally removing the OG survival tree, and I'm glad that this playstyle divergence is able to exist happily in its own talent tree. I wish they'd do something similar for things like Gladiator Warriors or Shockadins.</div></div><hr />

Don't you know it's World of MeleCraft for quite a while, anyway? :P</div></div><hr />

As others have said, the perfect storm of Demon Hunter being added, melee still being disproportionately punished by encounter mechanics, and changing one pure ranged DPS class' spec to melee, in aggregate, was a fundamentally flawed strategy.<br />
<br />
A potential solution, if Blizzard insisted on bringing back that type of functionality in the Survival role, would be making melee possible with an outlier combination of talents, similar to how it was with the original talent trees. Not mainstream, but certainly viable if you were curious enough to put that quirky mash-up of talents together. That would have been in the spirit of how Survival used to be without taking over a third of a ranged class' options. <br />

The 7.0 changes gave us Unholy DKs who were basically 1 core melee ability away from being a ranged spec.. maybe Survival could have been something like that but in reverse, with some optional melee-range talents to replace ranged abilities?</div></div><hr />

I actually think that it was good while I leveled it(it was actually very powerful while leveling). I have no idea or nor do I really care to how it performs at end-game, but yes that is an issue that has to be dealt with nonetheless. Having 3 specs on a character and they all being the same, ie ranged or pure dps, I always thought that was such a weird design to begin with. The same of course applies to classes like the mage for example, they should have turned one of those specs into a healing or tank spec. The same goes with the rogue. The most important thing is to have the specs feel like a big difference and not just the same. A change like on the hunter made perfect sense to me and was something that should have been done long ago. I just hope they do something similar with the other 3 dps spec classes or preferably turn one of the specs into tank or healer.</div></div><hr />

They added yet another melee class to the game, and then what do they do? Removed a ranged spec to turn it into melee. They have yet to add a ranged DPS class since this game came out, but they've added plenty of melee. Would be nice to see that changed.<br />

I'm enjoying melee hunter so speak for yourself, thanks. If you want ranged hunter there is BM or MM. No problem.<br />
Survival hunter is ton of fun. MM is most boring spec on the earth and I need to play it for raids atm.</div></div><hr />

I never said anything about the quality of the spec. I said it's dumb to remove a ranged spec when there's already so few of them compared to melee. As someone who's struggling to recruit ranged for my guild but is getting close to the point where we'll have more melee than we'll know what to do with, it's a problem. Turning Survival into an interesting new and different kind of ranged would've been preferable. Instead, they make another melee. It seems like it's decent, but it doesn't help this game's imbalance.</div></div><hr />

But survival never was true raid spec, mainly used for PvP. So they would need to change it that way when you have already hunter raid spec (MM).<br />
And it is the same now, survival is great in arena but due to his mechanics not so viable in PvE so far.<br />
<br />
I just don't see problem with one hunter spec being melee when you have other two ranged. It's not fault Blizz fault that people are playing melee even if you have less ranged specs in game which is right. If someone rly want to play ranged anyone can and don't tell me that survival being melee is such a breaking point.<br />
So many people were saying how survival is trash and they would never took him for raiding, always mm. And now it seems like there was no better spec in the game :)<br />
<br />
I have no problem playing survival and MM both together. And most of people have more chars now, its completely upon them if they choose melee or ranged or both.<br />
Yes, ranged variety is not so rich as melee but it never will be.<br />
<br />
But if Blizz going to add another spec into the game believe me it will be or at least will have option to be also ranged. I think they are aware of this situation.</div></div><hr />

Ride a pet into battle, use your polearm like a medieval knight, abilities that let you jump on and off, or something, I dunno. Could have been really freaking fun and a unique twist on tanking.<br />
<br />
Instead we got another melee class. And the class they added, which reasonably should have HAD a ranged spec (Demon Hunters throwing glaives using magic, etc)...didn't. Just another melee class and they had to stack it to the nines with cool shit they stole from other classes' specs so that it would be shiny for their new expansion.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt really care about Survival existing as a melee spec except that they gutted the other two 'real' specs to give Survival tools. Which just made the whole class kinda fall over.</div></div><hr />
