Sure, the tabard was okay, but a mount? It is just unfair to force people to buy the cards just to gain this mount. This is just like PAYING real cash for in game items.</div></div><hr />

There is already the Riding Turtle in-game. It's 0% speed increase so stop the god damn whine. The spectral tiger is nothing compared to a flying mount. It might even be 0% speed increase, too.<br />
<br />
Edit: seems that is epic speed.</div></div><hr />

Even if they did this mount rare drop you wont have more chances to get it anyway.And at least you have chance to buy code from an greedy dude who got lucky card.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what it is. Sure, I'd like to have it, but I'm not buying boxes upon boxes of trading cards for the thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuggle</div><div class="date">2007-07-12, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I think I'll try my luck with 1 box at most, if I get it, I'll be styling. If I don't, I wasted a few bucks. No big deal. I'd never fill the ol' shopping cart at walmart with them though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what I might do as well, 1 box and see what happens.... it looks like boxes are 60$ , how much would someone sell that tiger for? over 60$? 120? ...might it just be better to buy the card and for for the sure thing? (unless they use the code and then sell it...)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how much the turtle cards were going for at the time? <br />
<br />
Also is there any resale value for the cards?. Buy a box, get what you want, then sell the opened box/cards for 1/2 price? or will the marget be flooded?... I just don't care about the cards :P<br />
<br />
A rare card ... what's the % chance? 1 out of 200 packs? ... or is it just classified as rare? with no % chance listed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are not GAINING ingame benefits from playing the card game, you're gaining a novelty item, which is opt-in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who knows, but perhaps just as rare as the rare mounts in game 8)</div></div><hr />

<br />
just to clear up a few things for you:<br />
<br />
The loot cards arent rare, they are Legendary!<br />
<br />
your chance of getting 1 is approximately 1 in 300-500 booster packs (thats 1 in about every 20 BOXES!!!!(but may be higher or lower, as ude havent made an official announcement yet))<br />
<br />
the resale value of the remaining contents of the box will vary wildly depending on what cards you get (although if you sell soon after they come out, the resale will be higher, because people will want cards to complete sets for tournaments that are happening just after the new cxards become competion legal.)<br />
<br />
i would expect the cards to fetch very high prices on ebay to start with, but drop considerably when they get a bit more common ( those of us who play the card game competitively buy MANY boxes a month!)<br />
<br />
