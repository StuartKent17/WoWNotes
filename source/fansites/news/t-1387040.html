There has to be some net gain from the events here, something we use to battle the old gods, or Azshara, or the BL at the end of the day. If the entire expansion was just an interesting side quest with no bearing on current or near-future events, then when that happens, i will happily agree that time travel was retarded. But right now, we only know it is a tool to get us somewhere the story advancement needs us to be.<br />
<br />
The issue with the time travel naysayers just seems to be the story isn't going where *you* want to it to go, it sucks. To which, I say, go write your own story, get it picked up for a game world, and do better. Or cancel, both WoW and these forums, so the people who do enjoy it can do so peacefully.</div></div><hr />

it looks like they're sizing up a pretty good xpac. whether it'll stay that way is a different story. but with everything they just said i see a lot of potential for great things, and great failures.<br />

We aren't going back in time, the Dark Portal is turning red, bad guys are coming through. We look at the Orc Clans as they were, but things are happening now. The end of this expansion will launch the next one.<br />
So, uh<br />
<br />
Are the characters who were on Draenor and are still alive (Would that just be Velen now?) just going to have Elseworld clones running around?<br />
<br />
For that matter, is there now an Elseworld Azeroth that you could theoretically build a portal to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far all I see is a Mini-expansion.<br />
<br />
Everyone getting hyped up for this game sees some cool content (Player Garrison, Models, etc…)<br />
and maybe an interesting story!<br />
Hey it might work, it might not.<br />
<br />
What I see is:<br />
<br />
Every expansion has had smaller leaps of content than the last. From Vanilla to BC -&gt; a Whole new world and lotsastuff. BC -&gt; WOTLK an Amazing Story from Wc3 and Content -&gt; Cataclysm was the progression of NEW story and content -&gt; then we hit MoP. Mists had content that SHOULD have been in the previous expansions. Content such as: Transmogrification (Which was wanted since BC (but not screamed for)). Obvious things that make a good game better were made in MoP, Which actually wasn't a lot. I didn't really care for the story, but Pandas were acceptable. A whole expansion on them? Sure why not. It's more story. But the actual story of World of Warcraft? Didn't really appeal to that.<br />
<br />
What I saw was the word:<br />
<br />
&quot;Expansions&quot;<br />
Expansions (S)<br />
(S)<br />
<br />
SSSSSSS<br />
<br />
See that?<br />
<br />
Yeah I see this expansion as a MINI expansion. It's more of a large patch in my opinion as of right now. You have to remember that they will eventually run out of creative juice for newer interesting content that is still Warcraft. For the next 2-3 expansions that they have lined up, expect them to be more like patches, with content they purposely withhold to keep some attention.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to sound negative. But a Burning Legion expansion would have been way more interesting than this. I am -so .. sick… of Garrosh…-<br />
<br />
This expansion isn't ABOUT time travel, it's the catalyst for content. I think it's stupid they have to resort to messing with time to bring in a new antagonist. And if they are messing with time (Garrosh at least). Then F*** it. Go back in time, keep Arthas alive. Bring Illidan back. Throw Vashj into leadership of a Naga Invasion. It's just stupid in my opinion. No main villain is really dead if (GARROSH OF ALL CHARACTERS) lore characters can use time travel to mess with everything. Why can't others? <br />
<br />
Blizzard has had too many WRONG curveballs.<br />
Sylvannas should have been the one to silence Arthas. Illidan should make another appearance. Vashj should have had a bigger role in Outland. Deathwing really was not that big and badass as a giant slime bucket of lava (endgame, one of the most disappointing endings to an expansion (the fight)). And an ENTIRE expansion about Pandas who drink beer and kill innocent animals (Kill mother turtles for their baby eggs, YEAH! KILL ALL THE ANIMALS AND DRINK BEER). Was stupid as shit.</div></div><hr />

That opens a whole different can of what the hell.<br />
<br />
It sounds as if they're still struggling with the concept of just how to handle getting us into all the stuff they want us into. It almost seems like they're split between &quot;the players travel back in time to Draenor&quot; and &quot;Garrosh travelled back in time to Draenor, preventing its destruction, and now the present of Draenor has been changed&quot;. But both of those require an alternate universe explanation to not vastly change the present of Azeroth...<br />
<br />
Either that or old Draenor is somehow rebuilt from scratch a-la H2G2. That would be a bit of a cop-out... But it might actually be the most usable of the ideas, as it doesn't get into timey-wimey problems at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrosh is the only one that goes back in time. Him preventing the Orcs from drinking the demon blood changed the course of history. Because of this, Draenor is still intact and the Iron Horde are on our doorstep in OUR OWN TIME. When we go through the portal, we are not traveling back in time - we are experiencing the events on Draenor taking place in the current timeline due to Garrosh's influence.</div></div><hr />

From what they have said still sounds like time travel more than a parallel universe. It's kind of confusing but paradox's and time travel are suppose to be. Silly idea still IMO should have stuck with a different idea but same sort of theme.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so what you mean to say is, they didn't go to Azeroth in that altered timeline during the first and second war. In fact staying all those years on Draenor, not butchering the Draenei for the legion, in stead building up a massive invasion army all that time, better trained, more organized then before?<br />

<br />
That's what's happening here whether blizz wants to say it or not. Garrosh goes back to before Draenor became Outland in an alternate dimension. Their dark portal gets connected to our dimension. So no we are not changing anything from our wow lore. We are changing what happens in that other place. Maybe even preventing some of the shit that happened to us from happening to them (blood of mannoroth ect).<br />
<br />
It is weird, as much of a fanboy i think i am even i struggle with it a bit. but I'm loving the features. Only time will tell if this will be good or not.

So far it sounds like Garrosh is the only one time traveling, and we're meeting up with the pieces of his 'tampering' via the strongest, most alien object on Azeroth, The Dark Portal. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How did he escape?<br />
<br />
Well, in the Timewalker's quest line, we see a scene where Garrosh is in his cell and meets Anduin as a visitor right? I've got a feeling it's going to be tied to that incident(someone suggested it's Wrathion using 'ye olde' Dragon Shapeshifting..).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrosh is the only one that goes back in time. Him preventing the Orcs from drinking the demon blood changed the course of history. Because of this, Draenor is still intact and the Iron Horde are on our doorstep in OUR OWN TIME. When we go through the portal, we are not traveling back in time - we are experiencing the events on Draenor taking place in the current timeline due to Garrosh's influence.<br />
<br />
There cannot be a current Azeroth if Garrosh changed what happened on Draenor. There would be NO HORDE in Azeroth like there is today. There would be no Thrall, no Arthas, no Tauren, no Darkspear Trolls, everything would change.<br />
<br />
There HAS to be a traditional timetravel scenario, otherwise we could not play our characters the way they are now if at all. You are underestimating just how important timelines are in history; did you not pay attention to all the bronze dragonflight content throughout the game? It doesnt matter if it involves a different world, they all share the same existence in the timeline, especially since the events that happen on Draenor and Azeroth are interconnected over a span of years.<br />
<br />
The ONLY way a &quot;non timetravel&quot; scenario can work, is if the dark portals changing color signified an alternate universe; at that stage both timelines would remain intact and separate from each other. Considering Garrosh went back in time to before the blood curse event, it signifies that it IS a time travel situation. How much of one depends on how blizzard plays out the beginning story.<br />
<br />
But no, theres no way that Garrosh could mess with the events on Draenor and have it NOT affect everything on Azeroth that we know today. Its not as simple as &quot;he stepped on a bug...big deal&quot; he fundamentally changed the entire course of history and events by keeping the orcs from drinking the blood, which caused the wars and invasion afterwards, which gave the legion their foothold in Azeroth / Draenor, which is how Warcraft 3 and everything after it came to be.</div></div><hr />

Look at the number of bosses instead of the raids...honestly i whined about MoP, i whined about almost every patch in MoP....even some in cata...but for once i have NOTHING bad to say about what i saw at blizzcon, i'm a casual raider, i do raid finder with the occasional normal (Can never find a flex group so i don't count that), the story of WoD makes up for it's time travel shit, it's a brutal, serious storyline at long last! No more 'RAWR DRAGON' or 'RAWR PANDA' or 'RWAR YOU ARE NOT PRE-' or even..'RAWR MEERLY A SET BACK', this seems to redefine what WoW is all about and i am looking forward to it, i wanted to see garrosh escape and threaten the world just to slap those silly panda's in the face, he's pretty awesome for a bad guy, rivaling the lich king himself imo, and it's 7 dungeons, not 6 and one of them is the most loved of all time, plus it's DRAENEI lore, which alliance have been nagging for forever, sure their's some orcish thrown in there. But it isn't 'RAWR ORC' anymore, their is more if a tribal-political feel to it all now and thats what i'm loving.<br />
The zones, models, story, graphics, story, lore, did i mention story ? all of it is so rich and wonderfull and i couldn't be happier.</div></div><hr />

Can't we just have story continue properly, you know....Major lore characters to DIE, others to take over, old ones to come back, just have an evolving normal story. Next we will go back to save Thrall's grand-grand-grandma through the Dark Portal, which will be, in fact, some FUTURE reality, no? And then Thrall will die, which will actually happen 1000 years back, and we will resurrect Arthas' father, which again will happen in a future reality, and then Arthas' father and Thrall's mother will find each other, fall in love, marry, live happily ever after and that will end the conflict between Horde and Alliance and everyone will be happy. And then we will go back in time to steal a Black Dragonflight egg and put it in a future dimension and then bring it back in the current time and will will have Wrathion as the son of Thrall's mother and Arthas' father and...................<br />

He will likely not be successful with it. Or we will have a certain little dragon show up at the end of the expansion, do a time travel and kill Garrosh before he can change anything.

There were other races on Draenor. One of the ones that has always been mentioned in lore as existing was the ogres -- they are native to Draenor too. I expect the same will be said of the Arrakoa, and I expect we won't see many, if any, Ethereals showing up.<br />
<br />
But still. Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey indeed. They really don't seem to have a handle on it at all.<br />
<br />
I also wonder if the question about GROM's age was answered with a response about GARROSH's age. Saying that Grom is 'now' old enough to be Thrall's father makes no sense -- either he was always old enough to be Thrall's father, or he was never and can never be old enough to be Thrall's father.</div></div><hr />

Yes ... Its Blizzard way of telling a &quot;story&quot;. Its their way... or dont bother. I have already desided I will pick the latter one and will not touch this expansion.

Yeah... First Thrall sees Grom's death &quot;I mourn thy loss, dear friend, you will always be remembered!&quot;. Years later (if we supposedly DON&quot;T stop the Iron Horde in WoD) some Grom jumps into Azeroth and Thrall is supposed to be &quot;Oh, hello, thee, dear friend! Nice to see you!&quot;. Cause Groms Hellscreams rain from the sky every second Thursday!<br />
<br />
I say Thrall gets his current Aggra, then goes back in time, fixes some stuff, in a parallel universe there's a different version and timeline of Aggra, until a point when she jumps into Azeroth, so that Thrall can have 2 Aggras at the same time, for a threesome.<br />
<br />
No matter how they present it, it will be utter crap. <br />

At the moment it doesn't feel like they're showing us the lore. It feels like they're trying to convince us that the lore is cool and reasonable and valid, even though we all know it is not... Meh.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if that's going to be explained because of the Bronze Drakes. The Bronze Drakes are lords over time...ON AZEROTH. It always seemed like Azeroth was on it's own 'plane' of time from everything else. So Azeroth itself was protected, but 'shifted' off from Draenor's timeline. Think of it as a 'picture' in an art gallery being 'tilted' from the rest.<br />
<br />
I fully understand what they're trying to do(this ain't my first 'parallel universe/time travel rodeo'), and I applaud them for it, but I think we need to get a flowchart or something up here fast(not unlike Bioshock Infinite's flowchart, XD).</div></div><hr />

<br />
somebody halp me pls<br />
<br />
It all depends on how much Garrosh told them. I think that's the thing. There are two Velens. One that escaped to Azeroth when the original Draenor exploded, and one that remained on the new Draenor because it didn't blow up. There are two Gorehowls. One that came to Azeroth and was abandoned in Pandaria, and one in the new Draenor still in Grom's possession.<br />

<br />
I fully understand what they're trying to do(this ain't my first 'parallel universe/time travel rodeo'), and I applaud them for it, but I think we need to get a flowchart or something up here fast<br />

It's pathetic how many people can't grasp the concept and how this is NOT a time travel expansion:<br />
<br />
Garrosh is the only one that goes back in time. Him preventing the Orcs from drinking the demon blood changed the course of history. Because of this, Draenor is still intact and the Iron Horde are on our doorstep in OUR OWN TIME. When we go through the portal, we are not traveling back in time - we are experiencing the events on Draenor taking place in the current timeline due to Garrosh's influence.<br />
<br />
For me its one of the worst arguments to tell anything, basicaly they are sending us to a universe of &quot;What if...&quot; (marvel fans will get it)<br />
<br />
<br />
Think back to the DBZ scenario. Time isn't linear. It is a big ball of...well, you know the quote.<br />
<br />
The problem here is that all the time in the caverns of time blizzard sell the idea of a linear timeline universe: &quot;If u dont help Arthas to kill people in sthratholme, the world will colapse&quot; &quot;if u dont help thrall to get his freedom, there wont be any horde, so the legion wins&quot; &quot;if u dont help medivh to open the dark portal we are going to die&quot;, that means u didnt had to do anything (and the bronze dragonflight either), those things would only create alternate universes, no problem for our timeline (thats #!%/ to me)</div></div><hr />

Good question! There should be two of them. One from Azeroth, and the alternate one still on Draenor. Since he hasn't been mentioned (and Orgrim has), I suspect he'll be a nice little surprise ingame.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps Garrosh's method of time travel is different to the Infinite Dragonflight's. Or perhaps he never actually arrives in OUR past, but a slightly different version of our past, meaning any changes he makes don't affect our own timeline.<br />
<br />
I think the Infintes have more knowledge of time travel, and would be able to better work things so they will actually change history. Garrosh, though, probably just created a splinter timeline because he doesn't know how the Caverns work (if he even uses them). The Timewalkers and Bronzes don't want to take the risk, though, and they don't want to allow people to use alternate timelines as footholds to launch invasions, like the Iron Horde intends to do.</div></div><hr />

So far the only possible explanation for why every single event of the warcraft universe since the blood of mannoroth hasn't been cancelled (with the elimination of things such as the exsistence of blood elves, green orcs, and the discovery of kalimdor, the destruction of lordaeron, ect, basically every single event of the warcraft games is GONE), is the &quot;changes on one planet doesnt affect the other planet&quot; theory, which still leaves a huge, gaping, plothole:<br />
<br />
THE DARK PORTAL DOES NOT EXSIST IF THE ORCS WERE NEVER CORRUPTED! The orcs did not figure out themselves how to create the dark portal, and garrosh certainly has no clue on how that kind of thing is done, nor does anything suggest that nozdormu or wrathion know how to create interplanetary portals (which btw, was never created by medivh in this timeline, since the azeroth timeline did not change apparently.), meaning that there is no actual way for the iron horde to even contemplate an invasion of azeroth.<br />
<br />
Blizz has once again shown that they should stay far away from anything resembling timelines and time travel, they dont have the skill to write a story involving them, or they are just too plain lazy to do it in a way that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

I will spell it out for you: IT IS NOT A TIME TRAVEL XPAC. We don't travel *back* in time. The ancient Draenor *is brought* back from the past to the present. Changing anything there won't affect history. But since they were brought to our time, they will be able to invade us!<br />

Check out my diagram here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1387750-Dark-Portal-and-Warlords-of-Draenor-timeline?p=23410249#post23410249). That might shed some light on things. Even though Draenor changes, Azeroth's history remains unaffected because they are separate planets and those events already happened. NOTE: It's only a theory based on what Blizzard said today. I'm not claiming to have the right answers. EDIT: haha, I misread and didn't notice you said that was the only possible theory that makes some sense. :cool:<br />

<br />
<br />
According to this official page (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#questing):<br />
<br />
Gul'dan:<br />
Indebted to a demonic lord and pitted against the mentor he betrayed, Gul’dan is one of a handful of fel orcs on Draenor, his visage and shamanic power twisted balefully by demonic communion. The outcasts he leads, the Stormreaver clan, now fight to wrest their “rightful” place in the Iron Horde from Gul’dan’s former master Ner’zhul . . . and to tempt a great army of orcs into infernal corruption.<br />
<br />
Could it be perhaps he had knowledge of constructing the Dark Portal to share before being kicked aside from the Iron Horde? I was pretty perplexed myself about how a Dark Portal could exist on Draenor without Legion influence, then I found that profile.</div></div><hr />

If that's actually the case, it sounds like a ridiculously big friggin' retcon. As in... Garrosh changed history, so now Draenor never became the ruined Outland, so anything your character &quot;did&quot; while leveling through Outland, you never actually did. Thrallmar and Honor Hold? Never existed. Black Temple never even happened, it's still the pristine Karabor, and who the heck knows what happened with Illidan and Kael'thas... In fact, preventing the orcs from drinking Mannoroth's blood probably would've prevented the first invasion from happening when it did (especially if Garrosh is building up the Iron Horde to return for his own vengeful purposes), which would prevent the modern day Horde from existing, etc... so much paradox.<br />
<br />
It seems like it changes too much, it has to be an alternate timeline for any of that to even be possible. And that's just getting so convoluted that I don't like it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eugoogolizer</div><div class="date">2013-11-09, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen all the same dimensional, time paradox, time travel, temporal displacement, temporal duplicate fiction as everyone else and I'm still failing to grasp this. So by preventing red orcs from drinking Mannoroth's blood and becoming corrupted tools of the Legion, would he not have also stopped the first orc invasion through the Dark Portal? Therefore what happens on Draenor, does not necessarily stay on Draenor. Without the first invasion we should, in theory, have no orcs on Azeroth if that action was prevented. One could even surmise that we would have no Dark Portal at all, because without the Shadow Council bent to the Legion's will, Sargeras would have no real use for using Medivh to even create such a thing. <br />
So then, with no orcs what would would the Alliance races have been able to do on their entire continent with no orc invasions to worry about? Garona wouldn't have killed King Llane Wrynn. Varian likely not captured by anyone and put into battle. Maybe he wouldn't have turned out so tough. <br />
Then, to cap it all off, there would likely also have been no Scourge invasion at all. Ner'zhul obviously isn't trapped in a helmet and controlling armies of undead. So if that never happened, then there's no Forsaken, either. So we have Varian and Arthas chillin out at the taverns, hittin on the wenches for their 20's instead of fighting for their lives and... massacring civilians. Would Kel'Thuzad have even turned to evil without the Lich King (ner'zhul) swaying him? Dalaran and Quel'thalas lived on to be boss magical cities flourishing. Lordaeron is undead-free and ringin bells and whatnot.<br />
<br />
But let's say KJ found some other powerful being to be the Lich King, then how do we defeat Archimonde? Could the races of Azeroth have fought him off without Thrall to unite the Horde? Because again, no orcs. Maybe Archimonde gets his way and burns everything. But we can explain that away with the human forces, able to have built up strong over the years without orcish invasions to worry about and maybe Vol'jin was able to unite Trolls with the Tauren they were all able to hold off the Legion until the wisps made him all sparkly and we win another one for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Then we'd have things mostly the same up until Deathwing. A Horde with all the same races, except for orcs. Thrall was made out to be the pivotal character to save Azeroth from Deathwing. Could the Aspects have found another to control the Dragon Soul? Maybe they did.<br />
<br />
But really, it's a causality paradox. He went back in time to stop the orcs from becoming Legion tools, but in doing so it would erase him from the timeline that caused him to make the decision to change the past in the first place.<br />
<br />
Unless the Blizzard universe exists where temporal paradoxes are all okay and just splinter harmlessly into separate dimensions. Like the mirror universe in Star Trek. Then yes, our Azeroth could exist just as it does, however it would have also created a second Azeroth where the orcs didn't invade, etc etc as laid out above. Then the Iron Horde of Draenor, using Gul'dan and Ner'zhul's knowledge could create the other side of a portal from their dimension that connects to ours. Then I'd be very interested to see Azeroth-2, since Draenor would just essentially be Outland-2 by another name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrosh breaks free and goes back in time. Let me say here that the bronze Dragon flight lost there powers in Cata so whatever power they have now are a shadow of what they once had.<br />
<br />
Garrosh's action cause a parallel universe story to happen (been done loads like the TV show Fringe!) possibly because of the diminished powers of the bronze flight.<br />
<br />
Garrosh convinces the Horde leaders to form the Iron Horde. (and here is where it gets interesting...) He Tells Gul'Dan of another world (Azerorth) that is ripe for plunder, fulfilling the role that Medivh plays in the original timeline. Gul'dan already the first warlock and in communication with demons (as mentioned in his official bio on WoD site) has knowledge of how to create the dark portal.<br />
<br />
The Iron Horde decide to conquer the whole of Draenor first to then be unopposed when they invade this new land and construction of the Dark portal begins. At this point they kick Gul'dan out of the iron Horde (as per Bio)<br />
<br />
Fast forward to WoD... This Dark portal in the Parallel universe will *also* connect to our Dark portal thus allowing alternative reality Iron horde access to our Azeroth unchanged by its current history tied to Outland..<br />
<br />
We go via an event at Dark portal to this parallel universe to stop the iron horde form completing its conquest of Draenor to protect Azeroth. In some sense we are acting a bit like WarCraft 2: Beyond the dark portal on a larger scale in to a parallel universe... That's where we will start as players...<br />
<br />
Also worth noting reading the bios on the Site. Durotan is not with the Iron horde and Grommash is 50/50 with them which will be a nice subplot for Horde.<br />
<br />
Blizz has some tidying up to do over all that but essentially i think that's what Metzen was going with....</div></div><hr />

<br />
In order to garrosh to be ABLE TO GO BACK IN TIME, he need to exist, the horde needs to exists and to live the events of SoO ect. So our current timeline MUST STILL EXIST for Garrosh to go back in time.<br />
<br />
So when he go back in time he create an alternate universe where orcs never invaded Azeroth, ect. But Draenor intact is not in OUR universe, it is in an ALTERNATE universe. Otherwise the very existence of Garrosh-time-traveler would be wiped out from the beginning. After that, Garrosh finally connect the Dark Portal, but because he's the one who connect it, it connect to OUR universe, and it connect to the first point in time where he can be opened : right after Garrosh time-traveled. So for years and years he can't connect it simply because the fabric of the multiverse dosen't allow him to do so. The Dark Portal turning red means the connection has changed : instead of connecting to OUR draenor, which is Outland now, it connect to ALTERNATE Draenor, which is still intact and with the Iron Horde.<br />

I would laugh if Garrosh cross first and is killed at the start of the expansion when we defend against the Iron Horde !<br />

I think they're following the Time Travel rule that what happens in the past cannot be changed because it already happened (unlike say, Back to the Future where Marty started fading from existence because of past changes). But also because Azeroth and Draenor are two separate planets and thus share two separate timelines. What happens in Draenor's past doesn't affect Azeroth, because on Azeroth the Old Horde already stepped through the Dark Portal setting everything else (my &quot;bunch of stuff&quot;) into motion. It's already part of Azeroth's history. Changing Draenor's past affects/creates a new alternate reality for Draenor only. If someone went back in time and murdered a baby Arthas on Azeroth, then it would either 1) create a paradox for Azeroth or 2) create an alternate Azeroth. Since Blizzard said there is no paradox associated with WoD, this is the only THEORY I could think of that would make sense.<br />
<br />
And yes it IS a theory, by definition (&quot;Theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking. Depending on the context, the results might for example include generalized explanations of how nature works.&quot;-wikipedia) Time Travel doesn't exist in real life. It's not a real thing. So you're my newest dumbest person I know for thinking there are only three specific theories of time travel when any old science fiction writer can make up whatever they want. :cool:</div></div><hr />

If someone went back in time and murdered a baby Arthas on Azeroth, then it would either 1) create a paradox for Azeroth or 2) create an alternate Azeroth. Since Blizzard said there is no paradox associated with WoD, this is the only THEORY I could think of that would make sense.<br />
<br />
And yes it IS a theory, by definition (&quot;Theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking. Depending on the context, the results might for example include generalized explanations of how nature works.&quot;-wikipedia) Time Travel doesn't exist in real life. It's not a real thing. So you're my newest dumbest person I know for thinking there are only three specific theories of time travel when any old science fiction writer can make up whatever they want. :cool:<br />
<br />
You are totally right, we cant explain azeroth with our own physics; but the fact is that blizzard already give us an explanation and its hide beneath the caverns of time, the bronze dragonflight and the struggle to defend any change on time from the infinite dragonflight; that means we know (or at less we knew) that time travel in Azeroth is like back to the future, in wich anything u do in the past affects ur own present (why do u have to travel on time to help medivh, arthas and thrall if thats not it) and now, out of nowhere, they change that to make us belive that garrosh went back in time and the changes he did created a paralel universe?... #$%&amp;!<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless the Blizzard universe exists where temporal paradoxes are all okay and just splinter harmlessly into separate dimensions. Like the mirror universe in Star Trek. Then yes, our Azeroth could exist just as it does, however it would have also created a second Azeroth where the orcs didn't invade, etc etc as laid out above. Then the Iron Horde of Draenor, using Gul'dan and Ner'zhul's knowledge could create the other side of a portal from their dimension that connects to ours. Then I'd be very interested to see Azeroth-2, since Draenor would just essentially be Outland-2 by another name.<br />
<br />
the problem is that, so far they made us belive we dont live in that kind of universe (caverns of time) Im so mad about that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The worlds in WoW are probably like the ones in The Chronicles of Narnia. The Great Dark Beyond probably isn't exactly like our space, but lets you travel/see other universes, somewhat like that corridor universe that allowed travel between different worlds in &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot;.<br />
<br />
We can see that it probably works that way, as the Exodar is a dimensional ship, not a spaceship. There may be some special connection between the Draenor Universe and the Azeroth Universe, as there is between Narnia and Earth<br />
<br />
Since each world exists is in its own universe, the laws of time would function independently in each world (again, think Narnia vs Earth).<br />
<br />
<br />
Why there is Outland and New Draenor:<br />
<br />
Universes in WoW work different than they do here. <br />
<br />
Each &quot;Universe&quot; could be a Multiverse all by itself. <br />
<br />
We can see the Emerald Dream as its own universe in the Azeroth Multiverse, a pristine back-up copy of the Azeroth we live in now.<br />
<br />
Garrosh's going into the past spawns off a new universe in the Draenor Multiverse, and that's the one the Iron Horde is invading from.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Bronze Dragonflight<br />
The Bronze Dragonflight would be in charge of time in our universe alone.<br />
<br />
The Bronze Dragonflight's job is to prevent the spawns of these random universes in the Azeroth Multiverse. They keep real (as opposed to possible) universes in the Azeroth Multiverse to as few as possible (the Emerald Dream and the main Azeroth we live in).<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is New Draenor locking onto our Azeroth as opposed to the Azeroth in their universe?<br />
<br />
The fact that the Iron Horde is Stargate locking into our Dark Portal means that there ISN'T an alternative Azeroth with a Dark Portal (remember portals need to exist on each side).<br />
<br />
Since every world is in it's own universe, and nothing has been changed in our universe, New Draenor's Dark Portal is just locking onto the only Azeroth Dark Portal there is.</div></div><hr />
