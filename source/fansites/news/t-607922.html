<br />
I'm really hoping Kil'jaeden is going to be the fight those hardcore raiders have been waiting for, the &quot;impossible&quot; fight, with like 12 phases, each more harder than the one before, stuff that has to be timed on the second, boss that crushes for 30k at a point, etc. etc.<br />

It won't be though ;D<br />

What?? A Tanking weapon?? ur kiddin me. u know how slow it is?? faster weapons get Threat like 70% faster because of fast strikes, now building 5 sunders with a warglaive is gonna take u ages :P</div></div><hr />

Agree with you that a faster weapon is better for tanking, but that is because you can get more heroic strikes in, since they are &quot;next attack&quot; kind of ability. Sunder armor, or devistate are instant abilities and will be stacked just as fast with a slow weapon as with a fast one.<br />
<br />
One might say that a fast weapon build rage faster, but in a raid tanking perspective by far the largest part of rage comes from incomming damage, and not the tanks white damage. Over time a faster weapon dosnt generate more rage if they have the same dps, since the rage gain is normalized around the weaponspeed and damge per hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may be true, but this isn't about Incoming rage, it's about outgoing threat, if your in an unlimited rage situation you will do more threat with a faster weapon due to being able to use Heroic Strike more. It's why all of the tanking weapons in TBC are faster speeds.<br />
<br />
Thing is, using a slower weapon at the begining of the fight until 5 devestates could be a good way to cement initial aggro, with both SA threat and Dev threat, but once your getting no additional threat from the sunder stacking your faster weapon is going to do more threat</div></div><hr />

<br />
How will that be possible?<br />
Top raiding guilds do 25-30 tries a night. Considering 5 raidings days that's 130-150 tries. Just how much do you think is needed for them to get used to a fight? 1500 tries?<br />
Do you know how much 150 tries are?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kilssii</div><div class="date">2008-05-21, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">150 = 3?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
...no wait!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynhard</div><div class="date">2008-05-21, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand, why people hope the boss won't die fast.<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard outsourced time sink in form of the gate system. <br />
2. If a guild like Nihilum, that &quot;is going to&quot; raid for more than 16 hours a day (http://nihilum.mousesports.com/en/news/648,nihilum_is_recruiting/), won't kill him whithin a week, the boss tuning was a joke and no guild will ever kill the encounter.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kilssii</div><div class="date">2008-05-21, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe people want a challenge since BT and MT. H. was ez and if KJ dies in 2 days then it's not just hard enough since there are lots of phases and you need to learn each and every one of those. Every encounter is doable and KJ should be the hardest 1 of SW-bosses, so he should need perfect playing from every1 raid and that's not something you learn in 2-3 days.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharandris</div><div class="date">2008-05-21, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please don't forget that's more about finding the right tactics.<br />
If Blizzard gave them a manual &quot;How to beat the final boss of sunwell&quot; we would see him die on day 1. Doing something right in WoW isn't so hard.<br />
<br />
However, guilds like Nihilum and SK don't have ANY infos on the new encounters. They just have to try everything. Let's say, phase 2 of the encounter includes 3 hard hitting mobs, so bringing 3 tanks might be advisable and works pretty fine.<br />
However, phase 6 is the hardest dps race WoW has ever seen and there is no way you can fit the two bonus tanks in there.<br />
Suddenly they are back in phase 2 and try to manage this one with 2 or just 1 tank.<br />
<br />
This example isn't very good, I admit, however I think you'll get my point.<br />
Making up a good tactic is the one thing, but to decide wether this tactic just isn't working OR you just have to be an inch better is the other.<br />
<br />
Didn't it occur to you that you killed a boss with the tactic you came up first with after trying dozens of others?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
As a result, 150 tries on a single boss aren't that much. However, once the boss is killed, you shouldn't need more that 20 tries or even 10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Professional in the way they have sponsers sure, in there playstyle nah not really<br />
<br />
And yeah wouldnt surprise me at all, they may be a good guild but most of them have shit attitudes and make up crap like &quot;We are not a hardcore guild&quot; and &quot;only the endboss counts&quot;, Well Illidan isnt the hardest boss in BT its just a long fight, And sure they are not hardcore after clearing all the content just like every other guild who only raid twice a week after fully clearing it ;)</div></div><hr />
