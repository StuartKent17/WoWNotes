Patch 5.4 Raid Finder Item Level Requirement<br />
Currently on the PTR the Siege of Orgrimmar raid requires item level 496 to queue. Keep in mind this can and will likely change, as it started at 500 in a previous build.<br />
<br />
Vale of Eternal Sorrows - Venture through the scarred Vale of Eternal Blossoms, exploring unearthed mogu ruins to discover the source of the destruction.<br />
Gates of Retribution - War has come to the gates of Orgrimmar, as Alliance forces and the Darkspear Rebellion seek revenge against Garrosh Hellscream.<br />
The Underhold - Within a secret Kor'kron base carved into the sweltering caverns beneath Orgrimmar, Garrosh is assembling his ultimate army.<br />
Downfall - Wielding the dark power that lay dormant beneath Pandaria, Garrosh seeks to bring a new order to Azeroth. He must be stopped!<br />
<br />

Qiraji Guardling Spawn Rate<br />
Increase the spawn rate of the pet that spawns only in summer in Silithus please, with CRZ, there are just too many ninjars so there's no point even trying. <br />
It's supposed to be fairly rare. The spawn rate is determined while factoring in things like zone population (including how many people are coalesced cross-realm). Competition is to be expected.<br />
<br />
These are things to consider when frustrated by not catching a rare spawn within the first few hours it starts spawning for the season.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between &quot;supposed to be rare&quot; and frustrating game design. Frustrating game design is saying we're ok with having 100's of people farming the same location for hours, days, months, years...etc...because...we want it to be rare. Not frustrating game design is when its rare but you're only competing with a few people because you chose a server to begin with that is not high pop - just medium. <br />
You make a good point in your first couple of sentences, and that's something we're evaluating. That said, I don't agree with your conclusion that the &quot;good game design&quot; option is the one where the world is just under populated to the point that competition isn't much of a factor. Having low-pop realms wasn't a design decision -- it's a symptom of numerous variables. It's not acceptable for us to say that game design should be such that players can decide how rare something actually is by choosing the most accommodating realm to play on.<br />
<br />
What we want to do is continue to ensure the world feels populated, but that seeing people around you doesn't always feel like a negative thing. You've seen some of this in the way we've been experimenting with mob tapping the last couple of patches. Seeing people from your own faction in the world, especially, should be more of a positive thing. It's part of the fiction that you're supposed to be allies, not nuisances to each other.<br />
<br />
We don't have any specific plans to share for how we might change the way rare pet spawns work, though competition is likely to remain an inherent factor. But we'll continue to look for ways we can mitigate some of the annoyances of competing for some types of rare spawns with large numbers of players.<br />
<br />
It's important to note, however, that tinkering with these types of design decisions requires a metaphorical scalpel, when most of the feedback we get is akin to demanding the use of a butcher knife. No, we're not going to hastily redesign entire systems in the game because people are interested in catching a rare spawn, and can't all seem to succeed within less than 24 hours out of the (approximately) 2160 hours it has a chance to spawn this year.<br />
<br />
Why? What benefit is served by having open world pets be so difficult to find? <br />
There are hundreds of pets out in the world, most of which are easily caught. Rarity is a big part of what makes some pets more valued and desirable than others. <br />
<br />
Follow-up questions:<br />
<br />
Do you need this one? Should everyone be entitled to obtain any pet in the world with ease? <br />
<br />
If it's a pet that spawns during a 3-month window, what percentage of people who try to get it in the first 24 hours should succeed? Even if it's 99%, would this thread not still be filled with complaints from the 1% who keep failing? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/263040-too-many-ninjars-for-the-summer-pet/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9344634609?page=12#226))<br />
<br />
Raid Mount Drops<br />
There is a difference between removing a reward without advance notice, which is something we do indeed want to avoid doing, and introducing rewards that are stated up-front as being limited-time-availability (e.g., Gladiator mounts, the Kor'kron War Wolf, WoW Anniversary companion pets, etc.).<br />
<br />
We want to strike a balance between permanently available rewards that encourage players to go back and revisit content at a later date, and carving out some things that signify an accomplishment in a particular time and place. Years from now, when people see you riding a Kor'kron War Wolf, they'll know that you defeated Garrosh when he was the biggest threat to the safety of Azeroth. There's something to be said for that.<br />
<br />
There will be two other mounts from the Siege of Orgrimmar raid that will be available via more conventional means: First, there's the Reins of Galakras from the &quot;Glory of the Orgrimmar Raider&quot; achievement, which will no longer require Heroic boss kills, and thus be available to any interested players who can pass the various skill checks involved, on Flexible mode or above. (This also lets Heroic raiders who want the achievements or associated mount pursue those goals without compromising their Heroic progression or gear needs, as many of our &quot;kill the boss in an unusual way&quot; achievements have unfortunately tended to be nearly impossible to do on Heroic while the content is relevant.)<br />
<br />
Second, there will be a separate 100% drop mount from Heroic Garrosh, which will eventually be reduced to ~2% once the fight can be overpowered, in the same vein as Invincible or Mimiron's Head.<br />
<br />
Not a fan of removing the heroic kill requirement from the Glory meta. The glory metas have been a nice reward for heroic raiders in previous tiers when there wasn't a 100% heroic drop mount.<br />
But there is a 100% Heroic drop mount (yes, more than one will drop on 25-player kills). And we'd like to offer those more consistently going forward. I'd say it was a misstep on our part that Heroic Sha of Fear and Heroic Lei Shen did not offer one.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Glory of the ____ Raider&quot; achievements honestly have not made much sense or worked out particularly well for quite a while now. That structure was designed in a world with a single difficulty (3.0 Naxxramas), where guilds that had the zone on farm could make things harder and more interesting for themselves as they pursued those supplementary goals for a cosmetic reward. <br />
<br />
But nowadays we have Heroic mode, and as I mentioned above, a good number of achievements aren't really compatible with Heroic mode when done at the intended gear level (I'd like to meet the group that did &quot;Like an Arrow to the Face&quot; on Heroic mode during 5.0/5.1). The result is that the people who get Glory of the Raider achievements are a subset of those who finish the entire zone on Heroic while it is relevant. And often those people don't even get the achievement during that tier. Guilds will either take a week off from Heroic clearing after completing the zone and do an achievement run (often to the chagrin of raid members who don't particularly care about achievement points or mounts and would much rather have a chance at a Heroic Thunderforged weapon upgrade), or wait until the next tier entirely, and then go back with a smaller group and get the achievements on Normal. That really isn't what the &quot;Glory of the Raider&quot; achievements were intended to be.<br />
<br />
Without the need to worry at all about even the pretense of making them fair or completable on Heroic mode, we can also make sure that the achievements generally require a certain baseline level of execution (a la &quot;Show Me Your Moves!&quot; or &quot;The Mind-Killer&quot;) that will keep them feeling challenging and rewarding. The original Wrath of the Lich King 5-player dungeons were not terribly challenging, yet many of the original Glory of the Hero achievements certainly were in their time.

Patch 5.4 Hunter Changes<br />
So what do you guys think of the readiness change? I personally think they are finally tackling the problem and readiness and other class equivalents makes balancing the game extra messy, but I'd like to hear your views!<br />
Having 3 “trinkets” was definitely messy; I think hunters really needed this change. We just need to make sure that this isn’t one of those cases where something was so overpowered that its removal means we have to buff it somewhere else to keep everything in balance. <br />
Feedback from the PTR will be very important at this stage, if you have the time please do tell us what you think, is there a need to compensate for this nerf somewhere else, or is there any other class/ability that you think might be flying under our radar?

Which leads me to again state, off the official forums this time, that they really should have a Blizzard Workshop (like Steam Workshop), where they hold all rights to use whatever is submitted in any of their games should they choose to.<br />

I have to agree. I just feel like they implement the flexible raid lock that also awards achievements, mounts and gear that is has a higher item level than Throne of Thunder heroic for probably nowhere near as much effort as normal/heroic and then they say they want capturing a pet to be difficult?</div></div><hr />

&quot;But there is a 100% Heroic drop mount (yes, more than one will drop on 25-player kills). &quot; That means = min: 3 mounts drop/ kill in 25 or 10 man raids are far better... because 10players/1 mount in 10mode, and in 25 mode 25players/2 mounts ? WTF this is not math.... and wtf will do the other 5 ppl in the 25 raid team? they will leave and make a 10 man raider guild... to get chance for the mount...<br />
Gz Blizzard destroy all 25 raider guilds... they are epically rare, without RF the 25 raid mode is out of order...<br />
<br />
I want to see their next quarterly Report how lose more subs, because of this. They have no idea what players want, they just destroy their own game.<br />
Rare pet means for the blizzard = People need to spend more time to get the pet (more paid months) and blame other players instead of blizzard managers... Who want their money without work.</div></div><hr />

Eh? Not sure what you are complaining about. It will either be 3 mounts per 25 man, which would give incentive to do 25s, as it will only take 9 weeks to get everyone a mount vs 10 for 10 mans. That or there will be 2 that always drop and a 50% chance at one more, which give it 10 weeks (9 if you are lucky, 13 if very unlucky). I don't think most people will switch raid sizes just for changing their odds at a mount though.<br />
<br />
As far as the rare pet goes though, the problem is that it is the final step for many people for the zookeeper achieve, while previously, you could focus on one of many rare pets. Also, I don't recall the snowy owl (which only appears in winter) being rare.</div></div><hr />

That's really not the point.<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure why people are bitching about things being rare, ESPECIALLY when they're something as trivial as battle pets. <br />
<br />
Everyone likes to have rare things, but they don't have to want to put in effort to get them. You don't get to &quot;pick&quot; the difficulty of how rare you want something to be. That's just idiotic. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, this is the same with recolor... Great job for the lazy graphic employee. I think it was a 1 hour job for him and bum we can sell it like a new patch, brilliant.<br />

It's not a recolor in the slightest. The two look similar, but the shoulders and helm aren't the same model in any way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are stuff like the Qiraji Guardling that they can't simply defend, it's a bad design in all of their bad decisions about it:<br />
Deciding to make it stop spawn one week before it could be captured by players, then restrain it to a small patch of land, then making it respawn VERY VERY slowly, and as a cherry in the top, making it limited to a time frame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude tell me about it. I think the sets from vanilla, tbc, and wotlk were all pretty much great. Cata had some great ones too especially in Firelands, but man these sets from Pandaria raids have been just kinda sad imo. The mage one looks like a combination of the old Time Lord Regalia as others have said mixed with the rogue set from Throne lol. <br />
<br />
Also is anyone else sick of these tiny two handers we've been getting? I remember during Cata Blizzard stated they were going to go back to making two handers bigger and epic again but to this day they still have not done it. If you don't get what I mean just compare the Ashkhandi from vanilla to the one from Cataclysm. Pretty huge difference.<br />
<br />
And for laughs, try on some of todays two handed swords on a female blood elf character. Talk about turning a two handed into a dagger rofl<br />
<br />
In regards to Hearthstone... I didn't even know the beta had started for it yet so I'm shocked. Guessing MMO-C didn't post when it started? Or maybe I just missed it somehow. Dang</div></div><hr />

Mind telling which ones are actually small? I honestly think that most of them are big enough, maybe except for the axe from Lei-shen. <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with armors too, some colors are abit off, but it doesn't really matter...</div></div><hr />

And of course the share of people stuck in 2006, thinking that parroting what IGN say make them cool.<br />
<br />
Yes, people think they entitled to have a POSSIBLE way to finish their goals. Not a model where chance dictates random people to finish and others to see the opportunity ripped from them for another 9 months.</div></div><hr />
