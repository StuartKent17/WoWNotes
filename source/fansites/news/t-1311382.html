Patch 5.4 Warlock Changes Update<br />
We're going to try keeping Fel Flame as an instant, slightly buffed, with no DoT refeshing. Intent wasn't to nerf Fel Flame on top of nerfing Kil'Jaeden's Cunning. As long as locks don't become backpedaling Fel Flame spamming machines, we think this change should work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
From strictly a design perspective, why does every class need a viable dps spec?<br />
It doesn't. You could design the game without. Overall we reacted to feedback from the community that they want viable DPS specs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340949151082762240))<br />
But you could say e.g. priests are just healers or you could have buffer or support classes with low DPS. Just a different design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340949342137491457))<br />
Interesting, thanks! Followup: could you see WoW as ever having a class with a role other than tank/heal/dps in the future?<br />
Yes, but it would be a big change. Another challenge for the blogs and forums out there to discuss. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340960365020078080))<br />
<br />
I think GC has hinted previously that he thinks hunter specs should be more different<br />
Yup. Hunter and rogue specs play too similarly in our opinions. (Don't expect massive overhauls.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342530392877846528))<br />
<br />
what would make a raid leader chose a rogue over all those classes? not mentioning they are the only melee single role<br />
I don't know that you *need* a rogue or any class. We don't see rogues being sat though. Plenty of every class raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340912605436715008))<br />
<br />
WW monks need healing to be less of a dps loss?!? How about spriests? (just read icy veins interview)<br />
Our thought was that Shadow has a lot of other utility for a group. Healing is one of Windwalker's main contributions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340185188741033986))<br />
Healing WAS shadow's main contribution. Nerfed to the ground for the sake of PvP.<br />
It's not fair for them to have healing, mana, dispels and things like life grip on top of great damage and survivability. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340195217678413824))<br />
<br />
I think Homogenization is good for core things like interrupts, but is bad for more iconic abilities.<br />
That's actually what we aim for. We don't always nail it 100%. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339993472306126848))<br />
<br />
(I will mail you one of my summer reading recommendations if you address that one and clarify the Icy Veins response.)Neina was right. It was energy capping during AR. Low GCD helps burn energy, but not a solution we will use often. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339753189488345088))<br />
We are a bit defensive about GCD. Players always want less, because fast, responsive combat is fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339753430786658304))<br />
And while WoW combat is responsive (hint one of the secrets of our success) we are a server game and can't do Street Fighter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339753592250593280))<br />
<br />
How do you balance CC that breaks on DMG when moves such as Howling Blast AE's everything and is apart of main rotation<br />
Don't use HB if you absolutely can't afford to break the CC? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343793601119145984))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Questing is designed for dps specs?<br />
That was more true in Vanilla or BC. You can quest with just about any spec these days. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340946437825253376))<br />
Even if you can't kill things as fast as DPS, you don't spend 100% of your time in combat and Ts and Hs have other perks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340946998549172224))<br />
<br />
I guess the officers in your guild don't mind if someone doesn't gem, enchant and reforge their gear as well?<br />
That is expected because it is much less work and meaningfully impacts performance. Getting a belt slower does not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342642800510246912))<br />
<br />
Problem with caps: They make it feel like you need to meet them. If I get 500 VP one week, that's 500 VP gone forever.<br />
Totally. And they aren't there as a target. They are there to discourage dude with too much time from grinding 10k a week. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342640735960584192))<br />
Because the next thing we'd hear is: How am *I* supposed to grind 10K a week?! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342640912570150913))<br />
do you find lesser-&gt;elder charm system worked well? And have you thought making Valor similar? (i.e limit SPENT, not GAIN)<br />
Yes and yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342282957857378304))<br />
<br />
Really enjoying the 5.3 Barrens questing. Weekly VP quest, random escorts, commanders, epic item drops are all fun!<br />
Cool! If feedback is good, we'll certainly do more of it. Not all outdoor adventuring needs to be blue bangs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339751648534593536))<br />
<br />
Many players hate dailies - are you absolutely sure, game needs them?<br />
No, but the game does need something to get players out of queuing for instances from Org /SW. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339059302910279681))<br />
<br />
I'm tired of doing dailies?We are all tired of doing this.we play game to have fun,not tired.<br />
So don't do them? What is the specific reward that you feel requires you to run so many dailies? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333289889850351616))<br />
Honestly dailies are the quickest way to get lesser charms, I know there are other ways, but rng on those, dailies are boring<br />
I'm not sure that's true. Last week I got my charms by making a group and farming Barrens bosses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343427828185956352))<br />
GC seems to be missing the point, what is the difference between farming barrens and dailies? Same thing.<br />
If you never want to leave instances, just understand you're going to have a lot less content than other players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343479332372631553))<br />
<br />
There was nothing wrong with the rep tabard system. You changed it to dailies and dont like the fallout. GG<br />
I've explained before why we didn't like the tabard rep system, but once again: (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343800712809037825))<br />
1) It removed the world from WoW by letting instances provide all rewards in the most efficient way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343800808212684801))<br />
2) It made you manage a bunch of tabards in your UI. &quot;Oops. Left the one I wanted in my bank.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343800891536723968))<br />
The champion system lets you get some rep from dungeons without item management. We like it better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343800977549324289))<br />
<br />
Also making you get rep with GL before SP was silly. If you didnt want ppl to be overwhelmed. Make GL have 5 not 12 a day.<br />
It hasn't been that way in some time though. If you're still worried about GL rep, you might be missing out on a lot of content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343448255687974912))<br />
We're gonna be in 7.0 and people will still be crying about GL/dailies being mandatory<br />
Just remember this tweet in a couple of weeks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343475265931997187))<br />
<br />
I don't find dailies fun and don't find coming in lower on the DPS chart than I should because I didn't do them fun either.<br />
How is your DPS lower because you didn't do dailies? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343426025432182784))<br />

Wait a second! If I recall correctly, during Vanilla and early BC some Shaman and Paladin specs were only brought for the buffs and Bloodlust, so they were neither tank/heal/dps. Blizzard decided that this was bad game design, because it led to &quot;bring the class not the player&quot;. They rectified this flaw by making every spec of every class somewhat viable as either tank/heal/dps, &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; was born. And now this?</div></div><hr />

You're assuming blizzards route is to either keep tanks, healers, and DPS, or go back to stat stick players. I'm fairly certain other avenues for a fourth role exist.</div></div><hr />

What the fuck are you people doing that you need all these Lesser Charms of Good Fortune? I get all that I require just by doing the Tillers dailies (5 QUESTS A DAY OMFG!!11oneone), killing the shit required to complete those dailies, and killing random shit and rares. If you can't get these charms over the course of an entire week by doing these 3 things, you're doing it wrong. It doesn't require any effort whatsoever and you certainly don't fucking need to do every daily in the game. Shut the hell up already with your constant whining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I loot 50-60 of them in 1 and half hour by killing mobs in Barrens. Its even faster. So yeah whining about it is totally pointless.<br />
<br />
Also the hunter set is awesome. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I do still struggle a bit every week to get these 50 charms. I used to do tillers long time ago, but after a few weeks it gets boring, same for any other dailies. Right now I'm not doing any except sometimes pet battle dailies, since they give 2 charms + a chance to get way more (winning battle can give you up to 6 charms), also getting some from rare mobs.<br />
<br />
I kind of like the last changes on these, now I don't find myself being forced to do dailies, and can choose to go rare hunting / pet battles to get them instead.<br />

I don't think any more changes are needed on this, people who farm a lot will still have hundreds/thousands of them and don't know what to do with it, while not forcing other players to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having experienced the pain and confusion of leveling a new character to 90 in 5.3 (after a dix month break), it's a huge pain in the ass to figure out where you have to go, what rep you have to farm, where you have to do dailies, what faction you should spend your VP on and much more.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is your DPS lower because you didn't do dailies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dailies grant rep. Without that rep, you can't buy VP items. If you can't buy those VP items, your gear won't improve. If your gear doesn't improve, your DPS won't either. That's how dailies affect your DPS. Especcialy if you are unlucky in LFR, HC Dungeons and HC Scenario's, like I've been. I did 22 HC Dungeons in a few days and I got one item from it. ONE! Every boss dropped plate. I could have geared up a plate class to full 463 twice. Then there's LFR. Increased drop chance my ass. I've cleared all LFR's twice now and I got a total of 2 items from it and that includes bonus rolls on almost every boss.<br />
<br />
So, with that bad luck streak, all I have left are those damn dailies.<br />
<br />
Speaking of bad luck, I also hate it that Assassination requires daggers. I really wanna play Assassination, but I can't, because I've only ever had Fist Weapons drop for me from dungeons and LFR. Rogues are boring. It just feels weird as Combat to spend 5 combo points on Slice and Dice, feels like a huge waste, or on Rupture for that matter, which is only does 3% of your damage at best. Maybe it's my gear (501 ilvl) or the fact that I only have the tier 14 (2) set bonus, but Rogue is the complete opposite of what I thought it would be.</div></div><hr />

I was running ToT Normal 3 weeks after hitting 90. Number of factions grinded: 0. No, you don't need to do dailies anymore, not with perfectly fine Barrens weekly gear available. Are they perfect? Probably not, but it's all going to be replaced anyway. Between Barrens weekly, pre-ToT LFR, Heroic dungeons, world bosses, and the random scenario bags, the reps are no longer relevant.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot to mention the 502-ish item level boots you get from the Sha of Pride, help the old man up the mountain quest and the 522 item level neck you get for being neutral with Shado Pan Assault. They're basically giving you everything you need to walk into current content within 3 to 4 weeks of hitting level cap.<br />

Stop whining, healers had to re-learn their class every single expansion as it always changes tremendously. Warlocks just got hit by a big change when MoP was released, and now they're modifying it a bit. <br />
<br />
That said, DPS classes in WoW = select target, roll your face over the glowing animated buttons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not fair for them to have healing, mana, dispels and things like life grip on top of great damage and survivability.*<br />
<br />
Did I miss anything? Dispels? Got nerfed. Mana? Got nerfed(about the only class that can go oom at all). Healing? Got nerfed. Survivability? 15% less damage nerfed, dispersion nerfed. Life grip? Nerfed(was never used much in pve anyway...and for pvp it's dead).<br />
Why is a class that is so overpowered according to blizz...about the LAST to solo any type of hard content? I mean, that's not very logical, is it?</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure that's true. Last week I got my charms by making a group and farming Barrens bosses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343427828185956352))<br />
<br />
<br />
What the fuck are you people doing that you need all these Lesser Charms of Good Fortune? I get all that I require just by doing the Tillers dailies (5 QUESTS A DAY OMFG!!11oneone), killing the shit required to complete those dailies, and killing random shit and rares. If you can't get these charms over the course of an entire week by doing these 3 things, you're doing it wrong. It doesn't require any effort whatsoever and you certainly don't fucking need to do every daily in the game. Shut the hell up already with your constant whining.<br />

Well, his major in college was Computer Science for a while, later changed to Communications. He's displayed familiarity with gamer culture and slang in the past. He's had guests on to pitch major consoles and video games, as he did last night. I think it's for real.</div></div><hr />

I've explained before why we didn't like the tabard rep system, but once again: (Source)<br />
1) It removed the world from WoW by letting instances provide all rewards in the most efficient way. (Source)<br />
2) It made you manage a bunch of tabards in your UI. &quot;Oops. Left the one I wanted in my bank.&quot; (Source)<br />
The champion system lets you get some rep from dungeons without item management. We like it better. (Source)<br />
<br />
Does anyone see the problem with the above statement? Hint:its at the end... Last four words.<br />
<br />
I could care less myself. I don't do dailies, way way way to fucking boring! Its like death by a thousand cuts. I log on do heroics pick herbs, fly around.. Look for treasures in ponds lol. Raid in LFR. If my guild can get 10 people(usually short on healers and tanks) the normal raid. NO DAILIES!</div></div><hr />

You are confused, there is no problem, as it is their game, not yours. The tabard system was broken, simple as that. All people did was logon, farm dungeons, logout. Maybe raid, if you were into it.<br />
<br />
The current system may not appeal to you, but you have many options to gain your rep/charms, and if none of them appeal, maybe you need a new game, not an entitled attitude toward making the devs change the direction of their game to fit your needs.</div></div><hr />
