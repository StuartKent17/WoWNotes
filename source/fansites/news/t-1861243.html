Battle.net Mobile Authenticator Updated<br />
The Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app has recently been updated for both iOS and Android, and it’s been rebuilt from the ground up to make it faster, more efficient, and easier to use. You’ll also notice some extra shine and polish, including a brand-new design that displays a new piece of art from one of Blizzard’s games every time you load a code.<br />
<br />
Android<br />
Players using the iOS version will also now be able to use iCloud to make it easier than ever to back up and restore your Authenticator, streamlining the setup process whenever you need to recover or switch to a new device.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-bnaAndroid&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/thumb/bnaAndroid01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/bnaAndroid01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/thumb/bnaAndroid02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/bnaAndroid02.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
iOS<br />
Don’t have an Authenticator on your account? Download the free Battle.net Mobile Authenticator application for iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows devices here (http://us.battle.net/account/support/mobile-auth-download.xml?rhtml=y), or purchase a physical Battle.net Authenticator from the online Blizzard Gear Store (http://gear.blizzard.com/index.php/default/blizzard-gaming.html). Visit the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=bnetmobile) for more information, or head to the setup page (http://www.battle.net/bma/) to get started after you've downloaded the application.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
can anyone confirme that rares are only lootable once a day, even on TIMELESS ISLE? thanks^^<br />
This is only the case from WoD onward and does not affect timeless isle outside of a few chests (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/639487827034574848))<br />
<br />
Just wondering, what are your thoughts about maybe an infinite dragonflight mount in the future?<br />
Would be awesome, needs to make sense in context though (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/639578786174926848))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
if developers are confined by budget restraints, and they can't talk about them publicly, can they ever be honest?<br />
Being honest with players and having 100% transparency on all things are two different beasts. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/639470560389390336))<br />
<br />
wow is pretty tightly constrained by balance concerns. Wonder how wow might have developed without logs dbm or meters<br />
Better. I think have all separately expressed frustration with the &quot;Min/Max&quot; obsession.<br />
Yeah, when differences are 30%, I get it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/639469971211333632))<br />
When the balance &quot;problems&quot; are 2%, it's time to pay attention to real problems. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/639470236907900928))<br />

Android phones can be hacked without the user being aware simply by sending it a text message.<br />
<br />
IPhones are secure, but Droid is not. Just need the phone number and you can pwn a Droid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering its from one of the new zones in Legion, yeah, it does make sense in context. An infinite dragonflight mount though when theres been no infinite dragonflight content since Cata and none planned in the near future would make zero sense and be entirely out of context.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelanna</div><div class="date">2015-09-09, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Android phones can be hacked without the user being aware simply by sending it a text message.<br />
<br />

<br />
Saying that iOS is more secure than Android is like saying that driving sports cars result in more fatal crashes than pickup trucks. Yes, that may be statistically true (or not), but correlation does not equal causation. The fatality count has way more to do with the psychology of sports car owners (the driving habits of the kinds of people who buy sports cars) and the physics of the situation (you're more likely to survive a crash in a truck).<br />
<br />
So yes, while you see a larger number of hacked devices that are Android over iOS, the cause isn't in the operating system being inherently less secure. The culprit is far more likely that Android users tend to be more &quot;power users&quot; than iOS device owners, and are more likely to root and sideload apps than iOS owners are to jailbreak their devices. Since most sources of smartphone hacks are from malware that are sideloaded into devices, you can see why this might cause the statistics to show more hacked Android phones. Another culprit is Android's distributed update system. 3rd party manufacturers often lag behind in core updates while Apple has the ability to push updates to all their customers at once, thus if you aren't using vanilla Android, you may have problems picking up regular security patches. There has actually been significantly more vulnerabilities found in iOS than Android, something on the order of about 30%.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, Android gives you more rope to hang yourself with, the cost of giving you more freedom to do whatever you want with your phone. If you choose to use one, then it's on you to be more tech-savvy and security minded; blaming Android for having more hacks is somewhat unfair. If you want something that is is mindlessly secure, then iOS may be a better choice for you and there's nothing wrong with that. Just be aware that if you choose to jailbreak and sideload apps, then you are willingly giving up that security layer.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as an aside? iPhones have similar vulnerabilities that only require a text message to be received and not even read to trigger. (I can't seem to post URLs, but you can easily find the news article by searching for &quot;iphone hacked by text message&quot;.) Yes, I'm aware that crashing a phone isn't the same as compromising its security, but they're both news points from this year and it's food for thought.</div></div><hr />

That's true, but it's still more safe to download WinAuth (from its official source) and setup a two step protection on your account than to just rely on your password and IP range.<br />
<br />
I personally keep a copy of WinAuth in case something happens to my phone. At this stage, I'm more concerned about losing my phone and not being able to login than I am about getting hacked.<br />
<br />
Also, setup a unique email address with a unique password and use that only for your battle.net login.</div></div><hr />

You need to use the new Icon to access it now. Rather odd.</div></div><hr />

Yea the location I guess they could argue improves security (i.e. flag your authenticator if it suddenly pops up in Russia or something). But the rest smells like targeted ads incoming.</div></div><hr />
