<br />
<br />
Yep, right there with you. Didn't do a whole lot for me, especially since the ending of Arthas wasn't really known lore wise. I guess I shouldn't have been expecting anything at all, but I wanted something more epic. It was alright, but not what I was hoping for :*(</div></div><hr />

For me atleast, it was all epic up to where the ghost of Terenas disappears, then it kinda goes downward. Probably just me, in addition to reading the spoilers long before this.</div></div><hr />

Frankly put the way it's put there it's indeed made to be very very open to interpretation. Going from nothing is gonna change to Bolvar probably will end up being a boss right before Kil'jaeden when we go whoop his ass on Argus.<br />
<br />
Cinematicly, it's very well done in my opinion. But it feels empty due to lack of many key characters. 'keep it a secret' ugh. Sealing himself on the top of a spire which is a conduit for the Old Gods most likely.<br />
<br />
All in all, it looks nice, is a closure, but it feels way to much as a kick in the nuts due to how little it actually closes. Once again, we the heroes, have achieved... nothing.</div></div><hr />

I guess the issue is that it was blatantly obvious to anyone who pays any attention to what Uther says in HoR and what Arthas and Tirion shout when you start pulling in ICC. It didn't have that, &quot;Holy shit, did Arthas just pull a Saurfang on a Saurfang?

<br />
Gah.. This got me pretty angry. Blizz could have made 2 separate cinematics, one - where they'd show arthas death, second - bolvar becoming the lich king.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How bout no? If Ner'Zhul was dead there would be no Lich King. Try reading some lore sometime. Ner'Zhuls body diminished in the frozen throne but his essence lived on. It/he seduced Arthas, merged and became a new entity known as the Lich King but he was/is not dead. The same way Arthas became this new entity is the same way Bolvar does - by merging with the spirit of Ner'Zhul when placing his armor, specifically the helmet, on his head.<br />
<br />
To the rest: The expansion is about the &quot;fall of the Lich King&quot; and since a great deal of his abilities is tied to the soon to be broken Frostmourne he has indeed fallen. It's not the &quot;end of the Lich King&quot; it's the FALL. Meaning no more major threat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now they introduced a wall banger too due to the master-slave nature of the Lich King's dominion, thus a benevolent Lich King would effectively neutralize the whole Scourge unless Kel'Thuzad and his followers go the same way as Forsaken and make the whole sacrifice completely pointless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaire</div><div class="date">2010-02-01, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This ending tells me a lot of things<br />
<br />
1) Tirion helps you during the lich king fight.. possibly being the one to tank arthas himself most of the fight while your raid tanks deal with mini-bosses and/or adds<br />
<br />
2) Darion, if he does help during the fight at some point some how, dies. &lt;- this one is doubtful since darion really is just there to help you craft shadowmourne TO fight the lich king<br />
<br />
3) Tirion is not over joyed at Arthas' demise, Tirion's helmet is off, ashbringer is sheathed.. its a hollow and sad victory, when he yells after the faction champions fight in ToC and calls it a tragic and shallow victory and is being very snide? Take away the snideness and add actual emotion to him... something major happens DURING the fight that shakes everyones resolve for killing Arthas, even Tirion's in someway... killing Arthas was not a moment of victory for Tirion, and the events afterwards are just icing on the cake to show how truly sad all of this has been<br />
<br />
4) Tirion will perhaps be a key player in later expansions since Bolvar says his destiny lies elsewhere (and because they drug bolvar out of freaking no where to join this expansion anyway when they could have just as easily used Tirion)<br />
<br />
5) The Scourge may be involved in later expansions... though, I doubt it, Bolvar calls himself a &quot;jailer&quot; at the end, as if his purpose is now solely to contain the undead and hold them from doing much of anything.... he is a noble soul to be trusted to oversee the scourge and control them, not someone who will eventually bolster an army against us. MAYBE a long long time from now Bolvar will go insane and need to be destroyed as well, but it won't be during WoW, it would be during warcraft 5-6 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Been looking forward to seeing how Arthas was going to die since the end of the Frozen Thone.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I don't play WoW anymore, that ending was absolutly appauling. Blizzard's talent at storytelling has really gone downhill, I can only hope things get better with Starcraft 2 / Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
This goes back to my third point, the video itself isnt all that amazing (about as amazing as the events that happen at the end of the kil'jaden fight in sunwell, in cinematic form), it doesnt clear up a lot of whats going on with Arthas... meaning that what happens to explain everything happens DURING the fight itself rather than in some long overdone 10 minute video at the end. This video is simply to show what happens with Bolvar, Tirion, and the Lich king immediately after the battle ends to make sure the scourge doesnt run free... there, however, will be lots and lots of storytelling and explanations that go on DURING the fight itself</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aswed</div><div class="date">2010-02-01, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was pretty cool.<br />

It takes the crown to be the King, Frostmourne was never the conduit for controlling the scourge. Think of it more as the tool that lead Arthas to his end.<br />
<br />
Really an enjoyable cinematic, sure it may not have had all the key players, but we don't know how the fight goes down. I'm sure there will some sort of Illidan/Akama element that will require a number of the &quot;heavy hitters&quot; to prevent the scourge from climbing the spire to assist Arthas. From the footage we can guess Tirion (and maybe Bolvar) will provide the final smackdown, though i wish Jaina and Sylvanas were there.<br />
<br />
It's also safe to say, Ashbringer &gt; Frostmourne.<br />
<br />
Also, Goldeneye's!</div></div><hr />

Deep down, he really is a good person. If he weren't the prince of Lordaeron, he might've turned out to be a great paladin like Tirion. I'll be sad to see him fade away. <br />
<br />
Either way, Bolvar is insanely epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gah.. This got me pretty angry. Blizz could have made 2 separate cinematics, one - where they'd show arthas death, second - bolvar becoming the lich king.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want supa' imba unbeliveable deaths, go read any legend of the saints.. You want fireworks and 10 min clip of coughing Arthas?<br />

Ner'zhul IS gone, Arthas made sure of that on the Rise of the Lich King book. What was left of him was simply the Lich King entity.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, Blizz decides to retcon in the future and make Ner'zhul the one that was posing as Uther and Terenas, but for now, the lore stands as it was written on the book, Nerz'hul is gone.</div></div><hr />

I mean, all these lore characters congregate with the sole mission of killing Arthas, and only one of them make it into the cinematic? And the one lore figure that does show is Tirion?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I like Tirion, but I sincerely hope they have some lore set up to wrap up the Jaina, Sylvanas, Varian, Muradin, and other loose ends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, we all knew Bolvar will be the new LK. But pay attention to the subtleties.<br />
<br />
Facts:<br />
1. Nerzhul is one evil mofo.<br />
2. Nerzhul's body died, but essence remained. Yes, Arthas thought he killed off Nerzhul's essence, but let's face it, you can't kill off evil like that easily.<br />
3. Nerzhul had initially seduced Arthas, who is, deep down, a good guy, but his love of his people made him weak and blind. Hence, he was seduced into becoming the LK.<br />
4. Arthas's struggles with Nerzhul probably pissed the orc off quite a bit. Especially Arthas &quot;destroying&quot; him.<br />
5. Bolvar is less complex than Arthas. He's more black and white. And pissed beyond belief at the LK. Wants to kill him, with nothing standing in his way.<br />
6. Alexstraza f'ed Bolvar up, badly. Burned him to a crisp. But he survives, into something... else. Not human. But more importantly, she prevented him from killing the LK. Bolvar does not like her.<br />
7. Nerzhul wants someone less &quot;idealistic&quot; than Arthas. Someone more single-minded. Someone stronger to dominate.<br />
8. Arthas dies. Nerzhul needs a new vessel.<br />
9. Enter illusions and tricks, promises and threats. Tirion is not the man. He's too much like Arthas. We need someone more.... controllable.<br />
10. Listen to the voice of &quot;Bolvar&quot; at the end. And listen to the command. &quot;Speak of no one. Tell everyone Bolvar died.&quot; Look at the ghost of Terenas (Arthas's dad) when he makes his proclamation, and how he disappears. Look at what happens when the crown is placed on Bolvar's head. It's never been Frostmourne that made the Lich King. It's always been the crown.<br />
<br />
All in all, freakin' AWESOME!!!!</div></div><hr />

If you try reading some lore sometime, you would realise that Arthas killed Ner'zhul's essence in a dream state within the 'Lich King's' mind. It is in the Arthas novel which Chris Metzen has declared canon in regards to lore.<br />
<br />
The Lich King is an entity on it's own. Ner'zhul is no longer.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
You need to look up what a metaphore is and you will be a truely smarter person. Ner'zhul was not killed his controlling power was. Ner'zhul is the helm his spirit is in the helm the only way to kill him would be to destroy the helm itself. <br />
<br />
Im disppointed with this because arthas deserved a better send out. I wish they would have given him some lines to follow up the &quot;Is it over&quot;. Is what over? This seems to indicate that arthas was in some sort of dark dream. This spent about a minute of watching people move and not enough dialog. This clip is suppose to be about the lore not about the children wanting to see something cool happen or blow up. If you want that go see a micheal bay film.</div></div><hr />

The way he looked at the crown , the way he excluded everyone but himself to carry &quot;such a burden&quot;. Seem to me he almost hessitated in giving Bolvar the crown.<br />
Also if you listen carefully Bolvar's voice gets more and more thicker to the point he sounds like Ner'zhul in the end. <br />
I believe this. Nerzhul is gone , Arthas is gone . Bolvar is atm in the state the lich king was in We tft . He is no more than a pile of ice giving command right and left to the scourge . The only way for him to get outta there would be by chosing a champion so he can pull off another &quot; we are now one&quot; move , which would be lame.<br />
There are still alot of questions to answer. <br />
1. How did Bolvar sneak up on the throne? It's obvious Tirion gave the finishing blow , but he seemed suprised when he saw Bolvar's new form. How is that possible?<br />
2. Where's Sylvanas , Jaina ? I can imagine Jaina going crying in a corner , but Sylvanas? She would kill the entire Alliance and Horde to get her revenge. Did they die?<br />
3.This may be a silly one but. Frozen throne is frozen cause ...well the temperature is low. Bolvar seems to be bursting flames. He locked himself inside the house like Ner'zhul was locked by Kil'jaeden when he created him. Logically speaking ( lol logic in wow ) , how long will that barrier last if the man is fire itself, wont it melt?Eventually?<br />
4.What's Tiron place in lore now?Yo be quite honest he probably should have just died. His only objective was to kill the lich king. What does the Argent Crusade fight for now? against what exactly?. As we see from the video Tirion will just say that the lich king is dead and that bolvar died with him.<br />
5.So Tirion goes back down to the citadel and goes &quot; Hey dudes , lich king got pwned , bolvar hit the wall and we succeded.Hurray!&quot;. Can't believe noone would look up and notice that A FREAKING LAVAMAN took the helm and put it on his freaking head and that the scourge isn't going rampart at all .<br />
That's about what I could think at this hour , could come up with around 20+ questions about why's and how's , but wouldn't really count. Till we see the fight we cannot know for certain anything.</div></div><hr />

Also how did Bolvar become LAVAMAN tortured by the lich king???Wouldn't , you know , make SENSE for him to be a undead abomination of some kind?<br />
I am 100% sure that is Deathwing , they removed it cause it was ment for the expa pre-event for cataclysm when Deathwing will &quot;visit&quot; and destroy some areas.<br />
Again I am convinced and know for SURE Lavaman is Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Edit: tell me ONE reason why that guy can be Bolvar?Because he's called immolated champion in Ulduar?Seriously?<br />
The lich king is known for ripping his enemies apart and putting their parts togheter to form beast aka Thaddius.Mutating them , turning them into evil dks.What I wanna say is that if he could make lava men you would have seen a undead lava guy , mob whatever by now<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragonshardz</div><div class="date">2010-02-01, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Expected but pretty epic nevertheless. I especially like the twist they gave with Arthas and his father... probably meaning he got rid of the Lich King's influence and redeemed his soul (something I quite can't fathom after all he has done in the name of the Lich King, power controlled or not). <br />
<br />
The ending is especially great due to two things:<br />
<br />
1. Like someone mentioned before me, it gives Blizzard a chance to toy more with the future of the Scourge. There can be a new faction later on (or in WC4) which will be &quot;good&quot; (as opposed to Scourge being evil and all) or &quot;bad&quot; (the Lich King's spirit takes over Bolvar and there's a new Wrath). <br />
<br />
2. We (as players) are being brought even closer to the actual events of the story, not just by physically being there and defeating one of the biggest and badass bosses (lore and PvE wise), but also observing the encounter and getting to feel the reactions and drama between the main characters. It's just... awesome.<br />

Ya know what he's gonna do...nothing, not a dang thing. Why? Because his ass r an ice cube...for now anyway. <br />
<br />
My one hope, with Bolvar being the new lich king...as that when cata launches, the scourge that are remaining in azeroth be removed. Those zones(pl's) need something new going on. The scourge angle is over for now, so how's about we get their asses outta there lol</div></div><hr />

It seems that he died at the Wrathgate -&gt; in ICC: We must save him. By the light so it must happen -&gt; End: And the LK is dead.. and Bolvar Fordragon died with him. For such an end we cleared 1) Trial of the (Grand) Crusader 2) 11 bosses in Icecrown Citadel... great end &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you should look up how to spell 'metaphor'. It's all about interpretation. If you want to interpret the dream scene as Arthas seizing power from Ner'zhul rather than killing him all together, that's your interpretation. I prefer to interpret it as Ner'zhul ceasing to exist. Kil'jaeden created the Lich King from scratch using Ner'zhul's spirit and I interpret him as a seperate entity to that of Ner'zhul. Once Arthas destroys him in what I interpret as the Lich King's mind, he is gone and Arthas becomes the Lich King.<br />
<br />
So yes, I may have been hasty to judge before, but still Ner'zhul wasn't pulling the strings after Arthas gutted him.<br />

2. Nerzhul's body died, but essence remained. Yes, Arthas thought he killed off Nerzhul's essence, but let's face it, you can't kill off evil like that easily.<br />
3. Nerzhul had initially seduced Arthas, who is, deep down, a good guy, but his love of his people made him weak and blind. Hence, he was seduced into becoming the LK.<br />
4. Arthas's struggles with Nerzhul probably pissed the orc off quite a bit. Especially Arthas &quot;destroying&quot; him.<br />
5. Bolvar is less complex than Arthas. He's more black and white. And pissed beyond belief at the LK. Wants to kill him, with nothing standing in his way.<br />
6. Alexstraza f'ed Bolvar up, badly. Burned him to a crisp. But he survives, into something... else. Not human. But more importantly, she prevented him from killing the LK. Bolvar does not like her.<br />
7. Nerzhul wants someone less &quot;idealistic&quot; than Arthas. Someone more single-minded. Someone stronger to dominate.<br />
8. Arthas dies. Nerzhul needs a new vessel.<br />
9. Enter illusions and tricks, promises and threats. Tirion is not the man. He's too much like Arthas. We need someone more.... controllable.<br />
10. Listen to the voice of &quot;Bolvar&quot; at the end. And listen to the command. &quot;Speak of no one. Tell everyone Bolvar died.&quot; Look at the ghost of Terenas (Arthas's dad) when he makes his proclamation, and how he disappears. Look at what happens when the crown is placed on Bolvar's head. It's never been Frostmourne that made the Lich King. It's always been the crown.I'd like to refute most of those.<br />
1. Ner'zhul did evil acts yes, but either he thought he was doing good and being led by the legion to some other purpose(see: genocide of the spacegoats) or he was doing it for his own survival(which was his actions in WC3, he knew that the dreadlords were really on Azeroth to ensure that he didn't break from their plan.) Remember, Kiljaeden tortured him into submissiveness.<br />
2. Yeah, as to that whole dream sequence, let's not forget that LK Ner'zhul &gt;&gt;&gt; Arthas in terms of power.<br />
3. Seduced? He was at first trying to save his people, then he was purely focused on revenge against the dreadlords and finally he went power-mad. The lore certainly gives the suggestion that Ner'zhul was more pacifist than Arthas ended up.<br />
4. I'd say given the cinematic that Ner'zhul used arthas as a puppet the whole time, Arthas only thought he destroyed him.(Arthas' &quot;Is it over&quot;, then Bolvar at first speaking alongside Ner'zhul, then Ner'zhul alone telling Tirion to go away.)<br />
5. Dunno if that is true anymore. Bolvar says that the world of the living has nothing for him now. Doesn't seem to have the huge revenge thing that was Arthas' real only deal.<br />
6. If she hadn't burned him he would have died like the rest, or been turned like Saurfang Jr. He probably realizes that she saved his life in some way.<br />
7. That I agree with, Ner'zhul probably wanted someone smarter than Arthas.<br />
8. I'd say this might have been Ner'zhul's plan, he thought he had a good host, but realized that Arthas was not up to par.<br />
9. Note that Bolvar was Fire to Ner'zhul's Ice, definite imagery there.<br />
10. Yup.<br />
<br />
Other notes of mine:<br />
-Arthas' &quot;Father, is it over&quot; to his dad suggest that Arthas wasn't as evil or as in control as he thought he was, or that his humanity comes back to him during the fight.<br />
-Frostmourne's shattering looks like it released the spirits inside it as well, his dad comes down out of the swirling spirits.<br />
-Ner'zhul most certainly isn't dead. Unless Bolvar was having a bit of fun at the end of the video and perfectly imitated the voice of an orc. You can listen to the change yourself at 3:25 to 3:35. Starts as Bolvar, then you get both, and ends with only Ner'zhul.<br />
<br />
Ner'zhul aint dead.</div></div><hr />

Dont worry I dont think anyone will miss you :P RIP ARTHAS!!! I think his ending symbolizes that there is no turning towards the light for him in the end. He only sees darkness as in there is no hope for any sort of redemption.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malefic</div><div class="date">2010-02-01, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me that felt that Tirion was power hungry in this video? The way he looked at the crown , the way he excluded everyone but himself to carry &quot;such a burden&quot;. Seem to me he almost hessitated in giving Bolvar the crown.<br />
Also if you listen carefully Bolvar's voice gets more and more thicker to the point he sounds like Ner'zhul in the end. <br />
I believe this. Nerzhul is gone , Arthas is gone . Bolvar is atm in the state the lich king was in We tft . He is no more than a pile of ice giving command right and left to the scourge . The only way for him to get outta there would be by chosing a champion so he can pull off another &quot; we are now one&quot; move , which would be lame.<br />
There are still alot of questions to answer. <br />
1. How did Bolvar sneak up on the throne? It's obvious Tirion gave the finishing blow , but he seemed suprised when he saw Bolvar's new form. How is that possible?<br />
2. Where's Sylvanas , Jaina ? I can imagine Jaina going crying in a corner , but Sylvanas? She would kill the entire Alliance and Horde to get her revenge. Did they die?<br />
3.This may be a silly one but. Frozen throne is frozen cause ...well the temperature is low. Bolvar seems to be bursting flames. He locked himself inside the house like Ner'zhul was locked by Kil'jaeden when he created him. Logically speaking ( lol logic in wow ) , how long will that barrier last if the man is fire itself, wont it melt?Eventually?<br />
4.What's Tiron place in lore now?Yo be quite honest he probably should have just died. His only objective was to kill the lich king. What does the Argent Crusade fight for now? against what exactly?. As we see from the video Tirion will just say that the lich king is dead and that bolvar died with him.<br />
5.So Tirion goes back down to the citadel and goes &quot; Hey dudes , lich king got pwned , bolvar hit the wall and we succeded.Hurray!&quot;. Can't believe noone would look up and notice that A FREAKING LAVAMAN took the helm and put it on his freaking head and that the scourge isn't going rampart at all .<br />
That's about what I could think at this hour , could come up with around 20+ questions about why's and how's , but wouldn't really count. Till we see the fight we cannot know for certain anything.<br />
<br />
<br />

10 pages, 10 pages I had to read through to find a post that comments on how fucking power hungry Tirion looks when he picks up the helm.</div></div><hr />

Probably because nobody has fought the Lich King yet, why not WAIT until that part is shown?<br />
Then I guarantee the cinematic will make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's face it. Any random could've picked up that crown and let the Scourge just kill eachother. Threat gone. Why were they even held in check by Arthas anyway? He just liked doing nothing, waiting to get owned in the citadel? And why does Bolvar get frozen all of a sudden?<br />

<br />
What happened to Darion?<br />
What kind of entity is in the helmet now? <br />
Something must have happened to Nerzhul in the fight? <br />
What happened to Bolvar's voice? When we enter ICC it sounds like himself and as Lavaman he sounds different, I figured the dragon's flame that burnt him was Alextraza's at the wrath gate but perhaps not?<br />
<br />
I'm assuming most of this will be answered in the Lich King fight inside ICC, if not it will be a little disappointing.</div></div><hr />

I believe this was always pretty clear on the written lore and the Warcraft gameplay/cinematics.<br />
Arthas was never merged with Ner'zhul before he putted the Crown on. Before that he was just being manipulated by Ner'zhul through Frostmourne.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont remember KT in vanilla had a vid and no1 moaned.<br />
I dont remember illidan/KJ having one either.<br />
Those were also &quot;endbosses&quot; of a whole game/xpac and it never felt problematic till now.<br />
All you got so far was some more or less lame onliners before the foes beat the dust.<br />
<br />
Now you get all what you would have gotten from any bosskill BUT you get a video.<br />
So, as stated, you can ofc like the vid or not, but moaning that it is to short or anything, is argumenting in a way i cannot understand at all, since its the one and only time so far, you even got a vid.</div></div><hr />

It's all about interpretation. If you want to interpret the dream scene as Arthas seizing power from Ner'zhul rather than killing him all together, that's your interpretation. I prefer to interpret it as Ner'zhul ceasing to exist. Kil'jaeden created the Lich King from scratch using Ner'zhul's spirit and I interpret him as a seperate entity to that of Ner'zhul. Once Arthas destroys him in what I interpret as the Lich King's mind, he is gone and Arthas becomes the Lich King.<br />
<br />
So yes, I may have been hasty to judge before, but still Ner'zhul wasn't pulling the strings after Arthas gutted him.<br />
<br />
C<br />
x<br />
<br />
<br />
haha yeah i noticed that but im dealing with a bad comp and slow connection so i didn't go back and fix it. My point is you cannot kill something spiritual unless you destroy the spirit that is trapped in the armor. So until we get an official notice that hes dead as is gone from the story then he is still a force. But im betting they will just ignore him and hope we forget him. I found it really dumb that the voice was the same just before the ice covered him up. Its like all of a sudden you have to have this magical helm to control the scourge and thats not how it works. Kil'jaden created ner'zhul to control the scourge not a helm to control the scourge. When Ner'zhul joined with arthas he did it so he could move around and arthas decided he didnt like sharing power and since its his body he took the power and told ner'zhul to sit in a corner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would mean he wasn't evil in a mass murdering lunatic kind of way but in a &quot;I want my revenge and I'll destroy everything in my way&quot; way. Which, when just looking at intention, is less evil then I thought he was. It could also be an explanation for the Lich King's pansy behaviour in Northrend, if a stupid one.</div></div><hr />

Further proving the point that there's someone behind the mask! Ner'zul's power remains it seems. I bet he is even stronger that the time before he merged with Arthas. I think this will turn out similar to Diablo 1's ending twist.</div></div><hr />

Q. Will Ner'zhul appear at any point in 3.3 or the near future?<br />
<br />
A. Well, he is a chunk of the Lich King now. But if you mean will he appear as an orc, we're not ready to tell his story just yet. We have a lot of stories left to tell, but his is a good one.</div></div><hr />

The human was Tirion Fordring.<br />
The guy that put on the crown was Bolvar Fordragon (aka Lavaman).<br />
The ghost was indeed Arthas' father, Terenas Menethil II.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no. Bolvar can tell vast majority of the Scourge to jump into a volcano, be done with it and not have to bother with the popsicle jailor stuff anymore. Naturally there will be those with strong enough will or already free willed (Kel'Thuzad, Cult of the Damned) who will just tell him to sod off and disconnect theirselves from the Lich King and continue from where they left off. <br />
<br />
Seriously, Bolvar's sacrifice is just pointless. Why seal the evil in a can when you can destroy it? Unless you really want it to get free eventually.<br />
Another explanation would be that Bolvar is not what he seems and cheated Tirion into saving the Scourge instead of destroying it. Ner'zhul in Bolvar's body maybe? Wouldn't be first time an orc's spirit was stuffed into a body of a human.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nerz'Hul spirit is destroyed. Read the book. Arthas and him have a fight in their minds and arthas wins. I think the nerz'hul just sits quiet-idea in a corner is kinda silly. if you look at the words used in the book, it doesnt hint at that.<br />
<br />
Frostmourne corrupted arthas, not the helm. The helm is used to become the lich king, give you power over the undead.<br />
<br />
Frostmourne is destroyed, so i dont find it likely for Bolvar to be corrupted.<br />
<br />
The change of voice after he puts up the helm is not so surprising.<br />
<br />
Arthas, when he was lich king, had that voice too, even after nerz'hul was destroyed in the dream. I just think it goes with the whole lich king thing.<br />
<br />
Imo nerz'hul is gone and there is only the new lich king imo, where it's mind is only Bolvar, and not some lunatic orc too.<br />
<br />
EDIT: my thoughts on the video:<br />
<br />
too little we see of arthas or other major lore characters</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steveo</div><div class="date">2010-02-01, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do they need to keep it a secret? If the Arthas has been defeated and a good guy is in charge now, shouldn't that be something that makes people happy? <br />
<br />
I don't get it</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rulerx</div><div class="date">2010-02-01, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How bout no? If Ner'Zhul was dead there would be no Lich King. Try reading some lore sometime. Ner'Zhuls body diminished in the frozen throne but his essence lived on. It/he seduced Arthas, merged and became a new entity known as the Lich King but he was/is not dead. The same way Arthas became this new entity is the same way Bolvar does - by merging with the spirit of Ner'Zhul when placing his armor, specifically the helmet, on his head.<br />
<br />
To the rest: The expansion is about the &quot;fall of the Lich King&quot; and since a great deal of his abilities is tied to the soon to be broken Frostmourne he has indeed fallen. It's not the &quot;end of the Lich King&quot; it's the FALL. Meaning no more major threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're wrong, just wrong.....<br />
<br />
Ner'zul was a shaman of the horde. He then got corrupted and joined The Burning Legion. Then KJ renamed him to The Lich King and made him rule over the Scourge who would prepare Azeroth for the coming of the Legion. Arthas( who was a noble prince) got corrupted by the Lich King( who was a merge between Ner'Zul and this entity who was evil and wants to eradicate Azeroth) to become the existing instance of the Lich King. So the Lich King had 3 identities- Ner'Zul, Arthas and the Lich King(originally put there by KJ). But The Lich King destroyed the other two( you can read about this in the book). So do not get confused by those 3 names.</div></div><hr />

In the story no body but the Tirion and the champions who killed Arthas know that Bolvar is the new Lich King.<br />
So with that everybody else in the story will think that the Lich King is dead while it is really Bolvar trying to hold the scourge back.</div></div><hr />

Nerzhul playing some part in all this makes it a bit more understandable. Still doesn't explain Tirion's reaction of just walking away after Bolvar goes weird evil style. Why not ask him to let the Scourge blow eachother up?</div></div><hr />

Nerzhul playing some part in all this makes it a bit more understandable. Still doesn't explain Tirion's reaction of just walking away after Bolvar goes weird evil style. Why not ask him to let the Scourge blow eachother up?<br />
<br />
Because that would make sense. (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragonshardz</div><div class="date">2010-02-02, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">here it is to clarify it all up:<br />
<br />
Nerz'Hul spirit is destroyed. Read the book. Arthas and him have a fight in their minds and arthas wins. I think the nerz'hul just sits quiet-idea in a corner is kinda silly. if you look at the words used in the book, it doesnt hint at that.<br />
<br />
Frostmourne corrupted arthas, not the helm. The helm is used to become the lich king, give you power over the undead.<br />
<br />
Frostmourne is destroyed, so i dont find it likely for Bolvar to be corrupted.<br />
<br />
The change of voice after he puts up the helm is not so surprising.<br />
<br />
Arthas, when he was lich king, had that voice too, even after nerz'hul was destroyed in the dream. I just think it goes with the whole lich king thing.<br />
<br />
Imo nerz'hul is gone and there is only the new lich king imo, where it's mind is only Bolvar, and not some lunatic orc too.<br />
<br />
EDIT: my thoughts on the video:<br />
<br />
too little we see of arthas or other major lore characters<br />
<br />
<br />
First thing's first: The power of the Lich King, that power originally was given to Ner'zhul. HOW? Kil'Jaeden torn apart Ner'zhul's body, piece by piece, but keeping his spirit intact. His intention - to create a merciless being of unlimited necromatic power which will serve as the creator of an Undead force that will prepare Azeroth for the coming of the Burning Legion. The moment Kil'Jaeden transfered Ner'zhul into the Icy Casket and gave him the necromatic power, it was the moment where the Lich King was born. That spectral being, the one soul that can harness countless undead and bind them to its will... its called Lich King. So, ultimately, the Lich King/ Ner'zhul found a host in Arthas, and although it seems (in the god damned book) that Arthas killed the vision of the old shaman, you can't think that he kills the power - the power of the Lich King (NER&quot; FUCKING ZHUL)!<br />
<br />
And one more thing: remember how that little kid Mathias got spliced in half in the book, but still happen to give couple of quests in WOTLK? And yet you people claim Ner'zhul was vanquished forever... please...</div></div><hr />

If the Arthas has been defeated and a good guy is in charge now, shouldn't that be something that makes people happy? <br />
<br />
I don't get it<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it..<br />
<br />
Maybe Bolvar is ashamed of what he looks like now and what he will become and doesn't want to be remembered that way?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walexia</div><div class="date">2010-02-02, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, right there with you. Didn't do a whole lot for me, especially since the ending of Arthas wasn't really known lore wise. I guess I shouldn't have been expecting anything at all, but I wanted something more epic. It was alright, but not what I was hoping for :*(<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;<br />
thank goodness i am not alone, i feel like the people makin the video were a little clueless as to how to properly end this saga, not knowing that to properly end a saga all avenues of explanation must be satisfied for example would be nice to see the iconic wow characters in wow in the cinematic i mean it's the finale isnt it? what about the explanation as to why there has to be a lich king?<br />
<br />
sorry to say guys this cinemtaic would be good enough to impress small pre schoolers, but not intelligent awesome fans which have watched such epics as the lord of the rings<br />
<br />
(this isnt a &quot;hate against-the-game&quot; post btw , i wll still enjoy the game and i will buy cataclysm , i just think the pple in the story department need to be much much more inspired)</div></div><hr />

the power to control the undead comes from the helmet not Ner'zhul's spirit.<br />
<br />

<br />
thats not to say Ner'zhul is out the picture just that he is not the source of power over the undead. <br />
<br />
and orginally the nercomatic magic comes from the Nathrezim which is why the Legion could create such a thing in the 1st place.</div></div><hr />

Nerz'Hul spirit is destroyed. Read the book. Arthas and him have a fight in their minds and arthas wins. <br />
<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
Why does no one seem to remember this? Even people who claim to have read the book!<br />
<br />
Basically while Arthas was all frozen and cold on the throne he was having an internal battle between himself, his good side (represented by that little boy) and Ner'Zhul. Eventually Arthas casts out the boy, his good side. And Ner'Zhul thinks he won but then Arthas manages to get rid of him too! So it's only Arthas in there. That's it. He's corrupted yes but Ner'Zhul is gone. <br />
<br />
And at the point he casts Ner'Zhul out is when he awakens from his slumber (aka the Wrath of the Lich King expansion trailer).</div></div><hr />

<br />
correct, for the most part.<br />
<br />
I agree KJ didnt just put nerz'hul there and he became the lich king. He gave nerz'hul those powers to begin with and then sealed him away in the frozen throne.<br />
<br />
But that remains a question, no1 but blizzard itself can answer. Was there arthas and nerz'hul or arthas, nerz'hul and lich king in their fused mind?<br />
<br />
If it was the first, then nerz'hul being destroyed in the dream makes sense. Bolvar is just bolvar now then, not a fused mind. He just has the powers now contained in the helm.<br />
<br />
If its the latter, its complicated. Who's to tell the lich king presence is now also in bolvar, maybe it died with ner'zhul, cause that was the first being that was infused with those powers. i mean, its intelligent mind dissapeared, not his powers.</div></div><hr />

The track is entitled &quot;Arthas, My Son&quot; from the Wrath of the Lich King soundtrack.</div></div><hr />
