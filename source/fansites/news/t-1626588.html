You will be paired with a Resto Druid from the Burning Crusade era.<br />

<br />
Its like comparing hero's of the storm to dota 2<br />
The thing that really bothered me was how unoriginal the engineer dwarf thing was. FFS the sentry gun upgrades 3 times and looks very similar to tf2(level1 has one barrel, level 2 has 2 barrels, level 3 has 2 barrels and device to shoot rockets). The only thing that separates it is the hero powers? They seem kind of broken, not sure how that will be balanced at all. A sniper with heat vision? Does the gun aim itself and shoot for you also?</div></div><hr />

I actually like the 2d anime concept art (the old style actually reminds me of Daft Punk's Interstella), but we'll see how well it translates into 3d.<br />
And also the 6v6 limitation is very unappealing. I like larger-scale PvP, for the very same reasons that Arenas in WoW are my least favorite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that doesn't mean the game is &quot;trash&quot;, or terrible, or going to fail. It means I - merely one of 7 billion people in the world - won't play it. Blizzard won't care. And that's fine. Why on earth do people seem to expect to play EVERY Blizzard game? Why should every game appeal to every person? <br />
<br />
And honestly the &quot;it's for kids&quot; thing used as a criticism makes NO sense. Kids are humans too - humans who will one day be adults... can't fault Blizzard for doing what they can to bring a new generation on board. Kids these days aren't too interested in RTS and MMORPG, and Blizzard is a company not a public service - they have to do whatever it takes to chase the money or they'll have no future. Maybe if this doesn't appeal as it's too kiddy, just shake it off and accept you're a grown ass adult and there are upcoming generations that are in a lot of ways more appealing to game makers right now.</div></div><hr />

I don't know, I think they've done a really solid job with their other F2P games so far. At least you get to try it out first and see if it is for you, then if you enjoy it drop down the money for the price of a typical PC game and unlock a ton of content. That's how I handled Hearthstone and HoTs and it's worked out perfectly.<br />

<br />
Well, consider HotS... there's no basic &quot;push lanes and win&quot; MOBA style map. The game is all about objectives, and ignoring them will lead to a swift loss. The objectives add more dimensionality to the gameplay than just rote &quot;do this until you win.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Looks like another TF2. Players didn't seem to live longer than in other shooters either. If they manage to make every char really unique and still keep them all balanced it may have a chance...elseway this game is just another copycat.</div></div><hr />

Brink was twice as good as TF in both balance and game modes...but the game wasn't very known and had to shut down pretty fast. If this game comes even close to what Brink had to offer (or more) I'll gladly try it.<br />

I love people like you, are you honestly that naive that you believe Team Fortress is original? It has a solid concept and easy to drop in gameplay, which is good...but drop the fanboy act.<br />

What the actual fuck does this even mean?? Like how do you even form this thought in your mind let alone actually type it out and hit submit?<br />
<br />
And once again, lol @ people calling it a &quot;copy cat&quot; or a &quot;rip-off&quot;. Just because devs are influenced or inspired by other games (like pretty much every single game ever made is), it automatically means they're copy/pasting apparently. Didn't know TF2 had this many classes, this many abilities, this much mobility and ultimates. Hmm. Or maybe you saw the visual style and traditional elements of a team-based game with classes and immediately decided to compare in a negative way.<br />
<br />
Also, fuck having options, right? Who wants Blizz to put their spin on something that previously worked well, make it better, make it theirs and give us something polished and new to enjoy? Fuck those greedy bastards.</div></div><hr />

Or like, TF2 on crack. The hero abilities and kit are a huge part of the game and they're really huge and game-changing.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, based on earlier &quot;Titan&quot; leaks regarding sci-fi based online FPS, I think it's safe to say some of those ideas were incorporated into this game. They probably just dropped the MMO aspect.<br />
<br />
If you watch the stream and read what they've previously said about Titan, the only things they have in common is being set on Earth instead of another fantasy planet.<br />
<br />
They were asked specifically this in the Q&amp;A and the answer was that they shelved Titan to work on something different and that different thing was Overwatch. They might've recycled some minor concepts but that's where the similarity ends.<br />

No RPG or MMO elements whatsoever. This is an FPS. The heroes at the moment do not have any customisation either, the emphasis is on the heroes themselves. Of which there are currently 12 and apparently there will be a lot more.</div></div><hr />

I'm into shooter games but this one looks like a one I would play (I think I've found my main already, *looks at Mercy*). I don't really understand the hate coming on it.<br />

The one thing I don't like is switching heroes during a match. That HAS TO be gone. Like... yesterday. The game could use a bit more skills also. 7 would be nice instead of typical MOBA-style 4-5.</div></div><hr />

Here the conclusion of it: We Should stop making new game cause it will be always base on a game or an other genre etc. <br />
<br />
Jesus people, Like any blizzard game, you like or you dont. Stop the hate. Like we should said to Team fortress developer that there was a rip off of CTF game on real life or Deathmatch in the Roman collosieum, or whatever the hell you write. Yes, it does like similar to TF, but it's like any game, they will have their own difference, strong point and weakness as the other genre of game. So, stop the hate, when the game goes to beta, we will be able to make real comparaison. Everyone, will make there own idea of the game and decide to play it or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">construkt</div><div class="date">2014-11-09, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me preface this by saying that I love Blizzard games. They have a level of polish and ease of access that are unparalleled anywhere else in the gaming industry. When they make a game, I know it's going to feel responsive, there will be easy to handle hotkeys, ability bloat will be under control, and it will be very easy for me to get into it.<br />
<br />
However, I do not like the direction they are going. To me, this looks and sounds like their modified version of TF2. It just gives me the same feel. I think they are going to add in some UT2k4 level survivability to extend combat and allow for the finesse and timing of skilled players, but I don't feel like this is going to add anything to the genre.<br />
<br />
I felt that way about HotS when I started playing the alpha. It's like LoL, but without all the depth. They had a chance to cash in on the MOBA market years ago, but never did, and they missed the boat. HotS is not a good game compared to the others that they attempted to imitate. <br />
<br />
I think they had success with Hearthstone, which really could be summed up as a Warcraft version of Magic the Gathering Online, and now they think they can keep making polished renditions of other really popular games. I just don't think it'll work, and I really want to see them come back with real AAA, huge content games. I feel like D3 should have been much larger than it is, even. I'm not sure if this is a tightening of their belt, or a new financial strategy, but I'm really not a fan. What they're doing is played out and nothing feels original. Hell, even D3 is just a highly optimized, yet dulled down, Path of Exile (much better game, IMO, if only the desync issues got fixed). <br />
<br />
With that said, I hope Blizzard comes back with some large, original games that really bend the arms of other devs backwards and force them to look at making newer original content. WoW started a fairly dumbed down and easy version of Everquest. It evolved and now is most definitely it's own game that really defined an entire generation of MMO's and made everyone think differently about what the community wants. I hope they stop trying to rehash things that are already done and try to avoid looking at what makes other games succeed, and start looking at what makes failing games fail. Then they can fill the gap in the market. Until they do that, they are only damaging the entire industry for the gamer population which is starving for a paradigm shift.</div></div><hr />

I stopped reading there. If you don't understand the difference between a hardcore niche game and a max-audience game, you &quot;analysis&quot; will be &quot;slightly&quot; inaccurate.</div></div><hr />
