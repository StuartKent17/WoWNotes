<br />
Patch 4.1 Hotfixes - May 4<br />
May 3-4<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
An issue was preventing some players from properly mailing account bound items to other characters on the same realm and Battle.net account. If you are still experiencing this issue, we recommend you log into both characters before sending the mail. The characters don’t need to be online at the same time for this to work.<br />
Children’s Week quests should no longer be unavailable to players who recently transferred factions.<br />
Flying wisp form and flying mounts, both living and dead, can enter bodies of water smoothly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Spells or talents which provide pushback protection should now be functioning correctly (i.e. Burning Soul for mages or Suppression for warlocks). This time we mean it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Shadowstep is instantly teleporting players behind their target when the target is in motion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
Call to Arms rewards will now be displayed in the Dungeon Finder UI while a player is in the dungeon so they know what rewards they will get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throne of the Four Winds<br />
<br />
Damage from Ice Storm in phase 1 of Al’Akir is ticking twice per second, which was causing excessive damage on Heroic difficulty. To compensate, the damage per tick has been reduced for Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Players are now able to get a random Darkmoon card inside of a Sealed Scroll Case, instead of always getting a Darkmoon Card of Destruction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
<br />
The Innkeeper's Daughter can no longer be targeted for healing or harmful effects.<br />
Players now fail The Crucible of Carnage: The Earl of Evisceration when killed by Lord Geoffery Tulvan during the encounter. Players are able to pick up the quest after it is failed and the event starts again without issue.</div></div><hr />

Wtf? Really? Seems like really shit dps bonus. More like dps decrease if you're trying to get that on every cd. Its good for start of the fight. And when moving you can refresh it but from aside from that. Seems pretty useless. Well dk's get same but 4set is proc chance when other plate dps has 100% to do that dmg.

Wtf? Really? Seems like really shit dps bonus. More like dps decrease if you're trying to get that on every cd. Its good for start of the fight. And when moving you can refresh it but from aside from that. Seems pretty useless. Well dk's get same but 4set is proc chance when other plate dps has 100% to do that dmg. So if rng is a **** you could end up not hitting at all.<br />
<br />
Seeing as how the DK bonus is essentially the same idea and lasts for 2 minutes, I would probably guess that the warrior bonus would last just as long<br />
<br />
Making the tier bonus essentially up all the time for just keeping your buff up</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enhancement 2 Pieces - Your Lava Lash gains an additional 5% damage increase per application of Searing Flames on the target.<br />
Enhancement 4 Pieces - Your Stormstrike ability also increases Fire damage you deal to that target by 6%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration 2 Pieces - Your periodic healing from Riptide has a 40% chance to restore 1% of your base mana each time it heals a target.<br />
Restoration 4 Pieces - Your Chain Heal spell will jump to one additional target.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Elemental 2 Pieces - Your offensive spells have a chance to reset the remaining cooldown on your Fire Elemental Totem.<br />
Elemental 4 Pieces - Your Lava Surge talent also makes Lava Burst instant when it triggers.<br />
<br />
Enhancement looks good for both bonuses, but the resto 2-pc is meh and its 4-pc is plain stupid. Don't know enough about elemental to comment on it since I don't play that spec, but I've got my fingers crossed for you guys.</div></div><hr />

Rereading the 2 peice.. 40% proc seems high but 1% of base mana is a miniscule amount. Not sure its even gonna return the cost of single spell over the duration of a lifebloom. We'll see though.

Same. Since I am mainly healing 10mans I find myself snipehealing 90% of the time and Chain Heal spam is very rare for me. If this 4pc bonus is going to be useful at all in 10mans they better remove the range limit on the spell, period.</div></div><hr />

it's so that people can see throughout the dungeon if they're still eligible for the reward, as there were complaints that they way it is advertised thus far has been false. CtA doesn't occur when you queue, it's when the final boss is killed. so if one queues when, let's say, healers called, that doesn't necessarily mean that healers will receive the reward. this is just to clarify who will receive what. though it may well mean that people hold off killing the final boss till they get &quot;called&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yes cause it's so common for a 4p set bonus to require raid participation. How would any kind of DPS feel if their 4p bonus was something they randomly put on the floor in front of boss and other raid members must go click it so he gets a dps boost - it's retarded to say the least and so is the healing priests 4p bonus.</div></div><hr />

What if it just keeps adding it? Like you pop berserk, build up 5 combo points and hit FB, you get +2s, gotta build up more combo points, FB, then another 2+s. Would Berserk eventually run out still? Obviously if you can extend it indefinitely that's not how it would work, it would be way to OP, but what if it allows you to keep it up quite a bit longer, while changing what we do to add in FB instead of just Shred spam?</div></div><hr />

How would any kind of DPS feel if their 4p bonus was something they randomly put on the floor in front of boss and other raid members must go click it so he gets a dps boost - it's retarded to say the least and so is the healing priests 4p bonus.<br />
<br />
It's retarded just because you and your raid doesn't use lightwell. I use it everytime i see it down - requires 0 effort, only a mouse click. the set bonus summons lightwells by himself - heals on demand as needed. Your tanks will be happy i can assure you.</div></div><hr />

Tanks using the lightwell should get killed. The Hot vanishes if you get hit for more than 30% of you hp..... which basically any boss is able to.</div></div><hr />

Didn't know about this, really. Anyway the set bonus gives a direct heal, which should be fine. We need to know if the flame pops out randomly placed, near the priest or tnear the healed target. I imagine it's the last option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now something you have to look for and then click on is a direct heal? <br />
<br />
It boils down to other players to utilize it. If no-one utilizes it, it's as if this bonus doesn't exist on my set, so yeah it's shit, even if it's 90% utilized it's still shit as all the other 4p set bonuses up-till-now were always 100% utilized. <br />
<br />
A) It's a random chance that the Cauterizing Flame spawns (shit)<br />
B) You can't count on it to heal people 'cause it's random (shit)<br />
C) You can't count on it to heal people 'cause it might spawn away from everyone, and moving to it is not an option (healer standing away from group for various reasons, if it spawns on the healer)<br />
D) People have to find it and click it (shit)<br />
<br />
The list goes on...<br />
<br />
As said come back and join the debate when your DPS/Tank class has such a 4p set, that requires others to actually make it viable; Leave this discussion to the healers and foremost priests.</div></div><hr />

CtA doesn't occur when you queue, it's when the final boss is killed. so if one queues when, let's say, healers called, that doesn't necessarily mean that healers will receive the reward. this is just to clarify who will receive what. though it may well mean that people hold off killing the final boss till they get &quot;called&quot;<br />
<br />
Dunno where you got that idea, cause there's nothing like that in the hotfix notes.. I remember there was some problems with ppl getting the satchel, but you get it when final boss is killed, no matter what the CtA is atm. If healers have CtA when you queue, you're gonna get the satchel no matter what the situation is when the dungeon is completed. What Sofii is saying is exactly what i've been thinkin when i read that. Showing tanks (and healers) what they're gonna get when they finish is a bad idea, cause it's gonna lead to a lot of quitting for not getting what you want. For top geared tanks/healers the gold + blue gem/potion ain't gonna be reason enough to run with randoms, but not knowing what you will get has the excitement to pull it off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Valid points, but until we know where it positions itself, there's not really any point trying to judge it, as that will determine the use. Random is not shit, it's like bundles of the other sets - and having to click it is not 'shit' it means that you can take that heal whenever you want it. And before you rant about the priest thing, yes, I have 2 raidhealers, no neither are priests. My priest just broke 80, though, and I do raid with priests, so it's not like I'm talking from zero experience here. If the well spawns by the priest, I'll join you in disliking it. If it spawns by the target... that's better, but could still be an issue on some fights. The thing I would point out is that Lightwell is a huge heal, so it's not really analogous to other set bonuses at all - if this was just another proc, it'd be something far less dramatic that a lightwell charge.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not going to dwell on this - peace, guys. Looking forward to 4.2 already :D wonder what they'll reveal next that rocks hard?</div></div><hr />

The fact that we are the only class where, in order to maximise the 4piece, we require player interaction seems crazy. The other healer set bonus', especially shammies and druids, as such huge throughput increases to well used spells that it seems like the only way we can keep up is to go for the regen boost through a more frequent SF.<br />
<br />
Regardless of if the ember scales with spellpower or spawns and follows etc is not the point. The point is that it is out of our control. It is up to the player. In a world where its about looking where to move next, looking at boss timers and looking at spells to get your rotation right, no dps is going to be looking for an ember floating around because it will help out the poor priest. <br />
<br />
2 holy set<br />
2 shadow set<br />
Spec switch to veiled shadows and stack haste all the way. The boost in regen every 2 and a half minutes will help us try and compete with the other healers int he fact that we can keep on trucking for longer with increased output from the haste. <br />
<br />
So far, im really dissapointed with this patch in relation to healing priests. the tier looks shit, and now so is the set bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If not player utilizes it, it's the players' fault, not yours or of the set bonus.<br />
A) It's random, but it's free.<br />
B) You must not count on it. Intelligent people will use it to reduce strain on healers.<br />
C) We don't know where it spawns, obviously we will use it if it's near not if it pops over 9000 yd from us. That's why i say that it SHOULD pop near healed target. For the rest, read B.<br />
D) Read C; again, clicking something like lightwell requires 0 effort. If you cannot do it, you are dumb, really. I feel sorry for you.<br />
<br />
Don't call shit a design which is, in fact, intelligent. It's meant like this because you DON'T NEED TO RELY ON IT. Skilled players will make a good use of it, dumb ones will simply ignore it and tunnelvision the boss. Like always :)<br />
<br />
edit: i healed a lot with my priest. and i love this design. another barrier to separate bad players from skilled ones.</div></div><hr />

What in &quot;FREE HEAL&quot; is not understandable? Some will use it, some will don't. Do you lose something? No. If you wipe because people take damage and don't use it, it's players' fault. If you wipe because the tank dies from unavoidable damage, it's healers' fault.<br />

also do these fire damage abilities count as diseases when a dk uses them? Since critical rating is our least important stat(as unholy) and our 4pc basicacly requires crits<br />
If they did count as diseases that would be an interesting mechanic since your next ability for the next 4 sec will do 25% more damage but i guess im gettint ahead of myself it would be a cool idea though</div></div><hr />

Because it not this is going to buff mages and warlocks dps way too much.<br />
<br />
Enhancement 4 Pieces - Your Stormstrike ability also increases Fire damage you(?) deal to that target by 6%.<br />
Mage 4 Pieces - Your spells have an increased chance to trigger Brain Freeze, Hot Streak, or Arcane Missiles. In addition, Arcane Missiles is now castable while moving.<br />
Warlock 4 Pieces - Your Shadow Bolt and Incinerate spells have a 5% chance to increase all Shadow and Fire damage you deal by 20% for 8 sec.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Balance 2 Pieces - You have a chance to summon a Burning Treant to assist you in battle for 15 sec when you cast Wrath or Starfire.<br />
Balance 4 Pieces - While not in an Eclipse state, your Wrath generates 3 additional Lunar Energy and your Starfire generates 5 additional Solar Energy.<br />
<br />
I'm quite disappointed with those set bonuses especially if the treant is a fire version of one of the treants summone by Force of Nature <br />
(Treants damages sucks) especially compared to a 100% uptime buff like the 5% crit given to our dots (usually present on more than one target) also what is the internal cooldown? What are the Burning Treant damages?<br />
Is it another stupid proc-pet that we can't control when we switch target ?<br />
<br />
The 4set bonus is quite...meh IMHO<br />
With insect swarm and moonfire/sunfire moving the eclipse bar we will exit faster from eclipse....the four set bonus only compensate for this nerf...so no buff involved here...the t11 4pieces is a lot superior.<br />
WTF is 5 energy per starfire ??? after FOUR starfire we get the extra energy that one would have generated ?<br />
Did Blizzard forget that now we can no longer multidot while in eclipse? and that the few eclipsed dots we manage to put up will crit 5% less often without the 2piece t11 bonus ??<br />
Did the Dev forget that without the 100% crit, our starsurge after the 20% nerf is almost worhtless?<br />
Our dps may increase because of extra intellect from the new gear, but without the actual bonuses our dps will lack behind other classes.<br />
See shadow priest with spammable Shadow Fiend, and lol3secCd Mind Blast.<br />
<br />
Shadow 2 Pieces - Your Shadowfiend deals 20% additional damage as Fire damage and its cooldown is reduced by 75 sec.<br />
Shadow 4 Pieces - While you have Shadow Word: Pain, Devouring Plague, and Vampiric Touch active on the same target you gain Dark Flames, which reduces the cooldown of Mind Blast by 3 sec.<br />
<br />
No one will take BalanceDruids in raid because now shadowpriest can deal the same aoe damages and after the patch their single target damages will sky rocket.<br />
Everyone will only want Resto druids because of the new amazing healing capabilities (even better with the t12 bonus and the godly ToL+Lifebloom spam)<br />
<br />
I hope they change the set bonus to make it baseline because it only balance the dps loss we get from the new DoT's energy gains<br />
- Do something for our AoE damages that will drop by a ton (always because of the DoT's energy gains)<br />
- Fix the damned starfall number of shooting stars dropped on single target (we still miss 10 stars on single target)<br />
- Increase our treant damages (they are still the same as wotlk)<br />
- Give us a decent 4p t12 bonus because our Starsurge SUCKS without it.<br />
- Have They noticed that a starfire for 2.2 sec cast time while out of eclipse and self buffed only deals 12k damages?</div></div><hr />

HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS !<br />

The 2pc is really great if you really think about it : in normal situation , you'll get free mana sometimes (you always end to pop some heal on the beaconed tank) , and if you're running low on mana , you just spam holy light on the beaconed tank and you get looooot of mana (in less than 10 seconds you'll get 10 % of your max mana with it ... and since in this time you're not going to do a lot of useful heal , you can aswell pop your divine plea ...)<br />

Haven't played my sham for a while, what wep enchs did they use again? And what are the biggest dps sources they have?</div></div><hr />

The 2pc is really great if you really think about it : in normal situation , you'll get free mana sometimes (you always end to pop some heal on the beaconed tank) , and if you're running low on mana , you just spam holy light on the beaconed tank and you get looooot of mana (in less than 10 seconds you'll get 10 % of your max mana with it ... and since in this time you're not going to do a lot of useful heal , you can aswell pop your divine plea ...)<br />
<br />
And the 4pc is just crap , i mean 20 % ? it's just a ridiculous low amount for a 4pc set , which need you to get at least one token ...<br />
<br />
So much fail in one post.<br />
First - it's 2% BASE MANA, not MAX MANA. It has 40% chance to proc, and still you have to heal your beacon which happens rarely.<br />
Second - 20% is kinda huge. It's 6-7k with current gear.</div></div><hr />

I noticed it, simple dmg increase. Also, i found the procs on wowhead and they are only for hast, crit, mastery. The best situation possible :)<br />
<br />
You are an ignorant slob really. <br />
<br />
Does a shaman need people to click on him to make his chain heal jump another player? NO?<br />
Does a paladin need people to click on him to get the 20% passive healing on friendly players? NO?<br />
Does a druid need people to click on him to get extra major healing on 2 players? NO?<br />
<br />
So please drop it. We already have a talent spell that requires people to click it - it's called Lightwell and people use it and it's enough. We don't need another worse Lightwell one is enough.<br />
<br />
I don't even doubt that it will get changed, cause as it is, it's complete and utter crap, weather you can understand that or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I depends on playstyle. I always try to not heal the beaconed target for better efficiency (150% Heals) so thats why i dont like it, I didnt say it is bad ;) (ive got 63 holy power over Tower of Radiance in a whole raid / 2/3 talented) But in the end, its free mana but it isnt much...2% Basemana....its about what a judgement regs.. and with 40% proccchance its (theoreticly) 0.8%....<br />
And your holyligh spamming idea doesnt work, holy light costs more or about the same to what u get back from the 2 pc...<br />
<br />
<br />
and the the 4pc is a 20% increase in DL which is about 30% of my overall healing done and its a smart heal which wont land in overheal(unless everyone is @ 100%hp) It will hit about 4.5-5k.</div></div><hr />

Seriously why is the 2 set always more appealing then the 4 set. And why cant they make a more attractive 4 set bonus so that for once we actually go for it. I thought the point of making sets was to gain something extra while not changing your playstyle. Here i have to consider making more finishing moves maybe ending up in less dps then more dps. And the setbonus we have now when our mangle wich is not nessesary in our rotation at all gives us 3% ap at max stacks. Sure its a dps increase if you change your playstyle and can handle 1 more timer to think about. It was always a big talk about how to make it easier for feral druids to keep there rotations. The setbonuses we have and maybe will have if you keep this aint helping at all. Im sure there is plenty of other good 4 set combos to use with making rake, shred, rip, savage roar, auto attacks etc. Not using a 3 min cd ability and if you plan to keep this you should make all classes have simular boosts to there 3 min abilities. Please oh please try to make the 4 set more attractive and more equal between classes.</div></div><hr />

It's even worse than lightwell because it'll just pop up unexpectedly and randomly. &quot;REMEMBER TO CLICK MY LIGHTWELL, AND MY CAUTERIZING FLAME THAT MIGHT SPAWN&quot;<br />
<br />
Why won't people need to click the blooming flower on the ground to receive the extra lifebloom proc? Why must only priests suffer?<br />
<br />
Also, it makes no sense to give this to priests who already have the lightwell. If they gave this to another healer class, at least it would serve to educate the broad masses who don't click the lightwell, if another class also started nagging people to click the thingy.<br />
<br />
Give it to shaman instead - it seems a lot more like a shammy thing anyway (totem-like... fire...), and have priests get another 4p-bonus.</div></div><hr />

Here are mine 5 cents<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral 4 Pieces - Your finishing moves have a 20% chance per combo point to extend the duration of Berserk by 2 sec and your Barkskin ability grants an additional 10% chance to dodge for 12 sec.<br />
<br />
I believe Ferals will suffer again and won't have a good 4 piece set bonus. Sooner or later there will be a lot of maths and due to Tiger's Fury which is unable to pop during Berserk we will go out of energy and our Berserk will be extended by a maximum of 4 sec. Really confused about this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage 4 Pieces - Your spells have an increased chance to trigger Brain Freeze, Hot Streak, or Arcane Missiles. In addition, Arcane Missiles is now castable while moving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cool thing. I remeber when I saw a guy in the net cafe playing on a private server. He was playing a mage who could cast that while running/jumping and he was killing everything just with that. Haha.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Retribution 2 Pieces - Your Crusader Strike deals 15% additional damage as Fire damage over 4 sec.<br />
Retribution 4 Pieces - Increases the duration of your Zealotry ability by 15 sec.<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladins have gain again most powerful set bonuses, after 4/5 of t11 which was increasing Inquistion, we have now Zealotry increas almost by twice it normal duration. Sick.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow 2 Pieces - Your Shadowfiend deals 20% additional damage as Fire damage and its cooldown is reduced by 75 sec.<br />
Shadow 4 Pieces - While you have Shadow Word: Pain, Devouring Plague, and Vampiric Touch active on the same target you gain Dark Flames, which reduces the cooldown of Mind Blast by 3 sec.<br />
<br />
Ok, have I said that the other bonuses are sick? We know that Spriest were a bit weak, but this is huge. Spamable Shadowfiend, Spamable Mindblast, NICEEEEEEEEEEEEE</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you. Having one lightwell is enough although i do like the way in which the idea operates. What if it was changed to something like:<br />
<br />
Holy/Discipline 4 Pieces - You have a chance when you cast a helpful spell to summon three Cauterizing Flame patches on the ground. Friendly raid and party members can stand on the Cauterizing Flame patch to be instantly healed for 4625 to 5375. Lasts for 45 sec sec or 10 charges. After being Cauterized, players cannot benefit from it again for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
It would certainly make things more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
2-Piece - Your periodic healing from Riptide has a 40% chance to restore 1% of your base mana each time it heals a target.<br />
<br />
We got Teluric Currents to use now in Cata... ofc its often hard to use when the things aren't going fine but thats whole fun! That 2set is cool but personally I'd love to see some more cohesion in shammy changes, something with Teluric Curents or Unleash Elements. With<br />
<br />
<br />
4-Piece - Your Chain Heal spell will jump to one additional target.<br />
<br />
it will make us even more Chain Heal spammers then now (25mans). For the other hand at least both of that are usefull for me and not as like now where T11 2tier buff is mostly useless in 25 man environment.<br />
<br />
Shammy enhancement:<br />
<br />
<br />
2-Piece - Your Lava Lash gains an additional 5% damage increase per application of Searing Flames on the target.<br />
4-Piece - Your Stormstrike ability also increases Fire damage you deal to that target by 6%<br />
<br />
<br />
= never forget your searing totem. Never. Cool for single target. I was expecting also more cohesion here. Perheps something related to Unleash Elements? Why the hell buffing fire dmg if we going to kill fire elementals and Ragnaros? They should be resistant to fire. This changes will not affect my current rotation at all.</div></div><hr />

Again, imho it's a good thing to have other people to be aware of the surrounding enviroment. I can understand the feeling &quot;i don't have control on it&quot;, and as i said, if it demonstrates to be underpar in raids compared to other bonuses, it will be changed.<br />

You might not agree with his insulting way of a reply, but he is right. If you think the bonus is good then unfortunately, your wrong. You ask what we loose if people don't click on the spawn, we loose throughput. While others gain it passively, and in a great deal, ours is totally out of our hands. That said, the 2set shadow is just too good for us anyway. The potential amount of regen we can gain is huge and as we go further into firelands, the bosses will be become longer. We could see 3 shadowfiend uses in some fights. That gives us regen that no other healer has. Couple that with mana tide, we have the ability to seriously pump out HPS on a constant basis. <br />
<br />
The 4pc will be changed. Probably not much or to what would be best, but it will be changed. They won't allow all the healers worth their salt to go with 2/2, its not in their design philosophy.

<br />
Holy/Discipline 4 Pieces - You have a chance when you cast a helpful spell to summon three Cauterizing Flame patches on the ground. Friendly raid and party members can stand on the Cauterizing Flame patch to be instantly healed for 4625 to 5375. Lasts for 45 sec sec or 10 charges. After being Cauterized, players cannot benefit from it again for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
It would certainly make things more interesting.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah. Interesting for sure. If this were how it worked, my guild would probably lose a good hour trying to wrap their heads around that fact that standing in fire really DOES give you more HPs now.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Believe me...there will be tons of tanks that will join a random heroic, check what's in the bag if they succeed in the heroic...and leave if the right pet or mount isn't in it. Not that damage dealer or healer wouldn't do the same if they had the chance...;-)<br />

<br />
Maybe...although I don't see the sense in that because...well...if you join while the call to arms button is active then you already know that you will get the bag, right? ;-)<br />
And at the current situation it basicly means that tanks will always get the bag anyway...;-)<br />
So it wouldn't actually be a noteworthy change in my book.</div></div><hr />

If you think the bonus is good then unfortunately, your wrong. You ask what we loose if people don't click on the spawn, we loose throughput. While others gain it passively, and in a great deal, ours is totally out of our hands. That said, the 2set shadow is just too good for us anyway. The potential amount of regen we can gain is huge and as we go further into firelands, the bosses will be become longer. We could see 3 shadowfiend uses in some fights. That gives us regen that no other healer has. Couple that with mana tide, we have the ability to seriously pump out HPS on a constant basis. <br />
<br />
The 4pc will be changed. Probably not much or to what would be best, but it will be changed. They won't allow all the healers worth their salt to go with 2/2, its not in their design philosophy. We could also see the shadow 2pc be changed to make sure. Time will tell, but the general response is that it's just not good enough.<br />
<br />
This is a better explanation. I agree, if going 2holy/2shadow is better, they will either make more appealing 4holy or move 2shadow to 4shadow.</div></div><hr />

If the chance is high, we can have the fire elemental up all the time (provided you don't get stuck in fights where it somehow disappears, or simply stops attacking the target you want it to) since its on cool down when you summon it, and with a 2 minute duration, it gives a lot of chances for it to proc. Or if its really low, it forces using it in the beginning of the fight for a chance to do a good chunk more deeps.<br />
<br />
If the proc chance is high enough I would probably use it in restro spec along with the 2 piece restro bonus.</div></div><hr />

I can see the shaman tier bonus that has a 40% chance of riptide heal to cause us to gain 1% of our base mana to be seen as alittle over powered due to riptide being able to be placed on 3 targets at a time. But i can dig it :D<br />
<br />
Druids have similar for the lifebloom heals, and while lifebloom (outside of Tree of Life form) only hits one target, it heals every second, where I believe riptide heals every 3? So we're at least looking at the same regen as them.</div></div><hr />

If people in your raid (or other healers, or raid lead, or you yourself) aren't making good use out of it and reminding people to click it, that's your problem. It is a great spell. I love it.

<br />
I completely agree. How I see it is that this is similar to giving every other raid member one more spell to use, only that it is not on the action bar but on the ground. Complaining about not being able to use it is in a way like complaining about a new spell added to your class like: &quot;My action bar is already full and can't fit this new spell so it gives me no DPS, other classes have simpler rotations so they get more buff.&quot; If you cant fit your raging blow or necrotic strike on the action bar because its full of undress or spit macros its not Blizzard's freaking problem, just deal with it.<br />

I remember there was some problems with ppl getting the satchel, but you get it when final boss is killed, no matter what the CtA is atm. If healers have CtA when you queue, you're gonna get the satchel no matter what the situation is when the dungeon is completed. What Sofii is saying is exactly what i've been thinkin when i read that. Showing tanks (and healers) what they're gonna get when they finish is a bad idea, cause it's gonna lead to a lot of quitting for not getting what you want. For top geared tanks/healers the gold + blue gem/potion ain't gonna be reason enough to run with randoms, but not knowing what you will get has the excitement to pull it off.<br />
<br />
It doesnt say it will tell you whats in the satchel. It says it will tell you what you can expect to receive at the end of the run. So it should say something like &quot;70 VP, X Gold, Satchel&quot;, not &quot;70 VP, X Gold, Green proto from satchel&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st bonus - proc which can proc you yet another buggy, stupid, uncontrolled images which usually do the exact opposite of what would you expect or want them to do. they also scale terribly.<br />
<br />
2nd bonus - even now AB is 85% of our dmg and with every tier (more Int) it is going to be slightly more and more. Arcane spec is total fail we all know that. But if Blizzard is incompetent to erase this spec as a whole (and start over) or at least completely rebuild this spec :-) then they should at least give us some REASONABLE BONUSES!<br />
<br />
Arcane missiles are 5 - 10% of our dmg per encounter and in general: more AM you cast less dps you do :-) Proccing of AM is COMPLETELY OK right now and we DO NOT NEED more of them.. To be able to move with this sh**y spell is cool but it is like 1% DPS increase tops and this is for P4T12 absolutely inacceptable.<br />
<br />
For PVE Frost it is kinda better but for Fire it is again fail. Fire mages depend on mechanism of Hot streak which in most cases (when you have reasonable amount of crit) do not let you to lose any of those procs. What blizzard plans to do is put MORE F***ing RNG into the most RNG spec ever made in WoW and it will also cause more &quot;Hot Streak&quot; munching because P4 will proc from 1st crit and Tier4 talent Hot streak will proc from 2nd crit and you will most certainly NOT cancel another fireball and then cast previously procced pyroblast - DPS wise it is better to lose this proc. And now blizzard - why are you pushing us with next P4 Tier into such stupid decisions?<br />
<br />
And btw why we are forced to use for endgame progress such a sh**y spec like Arcane? well, i just hope that at least raids will be as challenging as hard modes in this raiding tier are :-/</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes it did because its a JOKE of a change people have been asking for more slots for a long time hell we are even prepared to pay for them but no we get it so we can move are characters up and down sounds more like an option for lazy people who cant be bothered to spend the extra second it takes to find a character<br />

@prankstar, Obvious troll detected. You can get an additional 10 character slots on your realm for another $15 a month. Plus this great addition allows you to play more than one character at a time.<br />
<br />
You'd be stupid not to pay for it.<br />
<br />
Or poor.<br />
<br />
first i have 2 accounts<br />
2nd i dont want play 2 accounts at once <br />
third go look up the definition of troll<br />
fourth having more slots on 1 account is what i want and as ive already said id pay for them as they are more practical and it saves having to keep logging in and out and adding authenticator details over and over</div></div><hr />

<br />
I raid rshaman (used to raid d/h priest), and whenever I see a lightwell down I wait until damage is hefty and call out over mumble for people to click it (sometimes specific people). It gets clicked. I even go back into logs sometimes to make sure people clicked it. If I'm too wrapped up in healing to call for it, then the raid leader calls for it.<br />
<br />
If people in your raid (or other healers, or raid lead, or you yourself) aren't making good use out of it and reminding people to click it, that's your problem. It is a great spell. I love it. The new four piece sounds awesome, and when one of my priests gets their 4 piece you bet your arse I'll be looking for it and calling it out.<br />
<br />
Another person who just doesn't get it. Call over mumble to click it is fine, doesn't mean people are going to click it. In addition, these are fire bosses, we're going to have a fire flame, who says your going to be able to see it? who says its actually going to do enough healing?<br />
<br />
But what you don't get is that the shadow 2piece is just...better. it's a huge amount of regen that is ON DEMAND. We control it. Scroll through logs all you like, i have better things to do that look for a flame on the ground in a bunch of flames. The set bonus is bad.</div></div><hr />

I'm not very happy with Resto Shaman's 4 set, but the 2 set is so good I'm going to overlook it. It might even get nerfed...(I hope not). The rest of the healing 2 set bonuses are just ok, but I don't see anything wrong with any of the healing 4 sets. People just like to hear themselves complain.</div></div><hr />

You consider 6% crit damage increase and a CONSTANT 25% statbonus to a random combat rating useless? You realise the 4 set lasts 30 seconds and tricks has 30 seconds cd, do you?</div></div><hr />

Clueless player is clueless. go reroll another class, i don't want you among rogues.<br />
<br />
Just to give a comparison, this set bonus is as powerful as 4t6 or 4t8, which were the best bonuses hands down for rogue. If they stay like this, we can already say that is could be worth to keep the bonus over 391 pieces. It scales so well that if t13 bonuses are not good enough, we can keep it.</div></div><hr />

ontop of that how to we place or control where the cauterizing flame will spawn &gt;.&lt;<br />

I noticed it, simple dmg increase. <br />
<br />
A damage increase to crit. It will turn our useless crit into a more viable stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, i found the procs on wowhead and they are only for hast, crit, mastery. The best situation possible :)<br />
<br />
Umm, it's the ONLY situation possible. It would be pointless to add hit or expertise and there aren't any other sub stats.<br />
