Patch 5.4 will add a a new raid difficulty: <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Raids in World of Warcraft have a long history of not just challenging players, but changing and evolving as the years and expansions go by. As with everything in the game, we’re always thinking about what more we can bring to raiding to improve the experience for an even wider range of players. While Normal and Heroic Raids are a great fit for many, we feel there’s another gap worth filling—and to that end, we’re currently working on the development of a new type of Raid for the next major content update: Flexible Raiding.<br />
<br />
One Size Does Not Fit All<br />
While it’s impossible to fit every player into a neat, tidy archetype, we recognize that we could be providing a better experience to one broad category of raider: social groups comprised predominantly of friends and family, and smaller guilds that do their best to include as many members in their Raid outings possible.<br />
<br />
During the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, the 10-player Normal difficulty served these groups of players pretty well, but the unification of 10-player and 25-player into a single difficulty effectively eliminated that niche. While Raid Finder mode is extremely accessible, it doesn’t provide smaller groups with a tight-knit social experience while progressing through the content. In Patch 5.4, we’re planning to introduce a new mode of raiding that allows us to deliver the sort of experience that we think these players are looking for.<br />
<br />
/Flex<br />
To fill this void, we’re in the process of developing a new Flexible Raid system, which includes a new difficulty that sits between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty, while still allowing friends, family, or pick-up groups to play together. This difficulty will be available for premade groups of 10–25 players, including any number in between. That means whether you have 11, 14, or 23 friends available for a Raid, they’ll all be able to participate.<br />
<br />
The Flexible Raid system is designed so that the challenge level will scale depending on how many players you have in the Raid. So if you switch between 14 players one week and 22 the next, the difficulty will adjust automatically. Keep in mind that unlike Raid Finder, no matchmaking is available, so you’ll need to make sure you invite people to attend—but if some can’t make it, it’s not the end of the world (or the Raid). You’ll also still be able to invite Real ID or Battle.net friends cross-realm. Who you choose to bring and what Item Level gear they’ll need to join your merry band is up to you, too—there’s no Item Level requirement for this Raid difficulty.<br />
<br />
Dressed to Kill<br />
A new Raid difficulty also means a new Item Level. Flexible mode will award loot with an Item Level that falls between Raid Finder and Normal quality, and will use the Raid Finder’s “per person” loot system, specialization choices, and bonus rolls, so you won’t need to worry about bringing the “wrong” person and having them win that piece of gear you’ve long been waiting for.<br />
<br />
You Have the Keys<br />
We plan to unlock the Flexible Raid difficulty in wings, similar to Raid Finder, but on an accelerated timetable. This new difficulty also has a separate Raid lockout from Raid Finder and Normal difficulty, allowing you to take part in all three if you so desire. You’ll also be able to complete portions of your “Glory of the Orgrimmar Raider” raid meta- achievement in Flexible mode as well as in Normal or Heroic to earn cosmetic rewards such as an epic mount. This will allow Raid groups the opportunity to switch off nights between raids to complete achievements. Finally, taking part in Flexible, Normal, or Heroic difficulty will provide access to additional rewards that won’t be available in Raid Finder.<br />
<br />
Getting Down to Brass Tacks<br />
As with any in-development feature, we’re continuing to refine how the Flexible Raid system will work, and we look forward to hearing your constructive feedback from your experiences on the Public Test Realm when the new system goes live.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, luckily this doesn't affect heroic raiding at all. If getting more people to raid means that the dev teams will focus more on awesome raid content then I'm all for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ishayu</div><div class="date">2013-06-07, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a pretty good idea but I can't help but feel it's accomplishing what LFR tried to accomplish but in a much better way. It's a great way for the PuGs and the social players to get to see the raid content.<br />
<br />
However, I think 4 difficulty levels is too many. This thing is like LFR but way better in every way. It has all the strengths of the accessibility - especially with it being &quot;flexible and cross server&quot;. However, it also doesn't let people play like utter crap and escape all social responsibility.<br />
<br />
This is what LFR should have been, and I applaud it for that reason alone. LFR needs to be axed, though. It was pretty bad.</div></div><hr />

I hope it doesn't become too big of a deal for normal/heroic raiders to do each week though. <br />

I really like that you can in as a group of 15 or 20 now and still have a good time.</div></div><hr />

I feel like this is a sort of balance between normal and LFR (okay it is) but there's something about it I can't put my finger on. Like they should have done this from the start, or at least for LFR. the main benefit of LFR is that you can find other folks, so people without a guild can still raid. <br />
<br />
Anyway, seems like a good idea. Interested to see how it pans out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always thought these were the origins of the problem. Ulduar was fun. No LFR, no Heroic, only adjustable difficulty via special mechanics or achievements.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't know if that new flexible thing is needed. People will also complain that they &quot;need&quot; to do everything in order to get the best gear they can for progression.</div></div><hr />

NOPE. Instantly not interested in it at all. A terrible and flawed system that needs to be abolished, not encouraged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should remove 25 man raiding and make all raiding 10 man except for LFR.<br />
<br />
Normal mode should be like flex, allowing you to invite friends and scaling to how many people you have. Limit is 10 people.</div></div><hr />

Remember when people used to run 25m PUGs on your server in Wrath? Remember when servers had a real community other than &quot;in my guild vs. random cross server people IDC about&quot;?<br />
<br />
Really hoping this brings it back!!! Great idea Blizz!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for wanting it to scale below 10, there are probably logistical considerations -- fights still needing two tanks etc -- that make it easier to set that as the lower bound. The whole point of this is to pug a bunch of people from trade and get better stuff than LFR.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">balir</div><div class="date">2013-06-07, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they could work it to scale with 7,8,9 players that would be great.

Here's how to improve it: remove 10 man normal, remove 25man normal, add flex size normal. Done.<br />
<br />
Screw 4 ilvl tiers, 3 lockouts and 4 difficulties.</div></div><hr />

.@Binkenstein @Warcraft As @Ghostcrawler said, pick the feature in 5.4 you like best and *that’s* the big expansion feature. There’s a few.<br />
<br />
So if you don't like this one there's another there's &quot;a few&quot; to chose from.</div></div><hr />

Yeah guys lets take away wotlk style raiding where 10 man was rewarding lower ilvl loot by a fraction and was a little easier for people to play with their friends in in favour of sharing lockouts for 10 and 25. Then lets chuck in raid finder and make it compulsory to gear so that anyone who wants to raid has to do it to get anywhere in the first place. And now lets make ANOTHER mode of the same encounter when all we have done is whinge about how we can't balance 10 and 25 man to be equal in difficulty yet we now can miraculously with any number between 10 and 25...<br />
<br />
Seriously.. what the hell??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too hard for LFR ppl. Not for normal ppl.<br />
<br />
But that won't fix it. They don't care about socialization, managing groups, etc. most complainers just want the higher ilvl without the increased challenge from normal or heroic.<br />
<br />
Most will see that the gear is still lower ilvl than normal mode and will find that offensive.</div></div><hr />

This is actually pretty huge. People can bring 15 people to a raid instead of 25 and instead of 10. Imagine if they later add this mode to normal and heroic. No more benching of players. This can be game changing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes having only 8 or 9 people to raid is the reason some raid groups fall apart.<br />
<br />
Agree, seems kinda pointless to me as a 10-man guild as it won't be something we can do when raids are cancelled/finish early because we ended up a few players short.<br />
<br />
Seems kinda good for cheesing glory achvs and not a lot else - kinda not happy with the idea of needing to do LFR, LFR+ and normal raids every week if we're after trinkets/tier bonuses. Having normal modes scale would have been far more appealing so you could run 12 players for 10-man without the need to sit guys each week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are some things to think about: Raids usually need 2 tanks, at least 2 healers, etc. Wonder if you can still run it with 8 (even though it would scale down to 10), seeing as it's a different difficulty level. Essentially 8-man it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is actually pretty huge. People can bring 15 people to a raid instead of 25 and instead of 10. Imagine if they later add this mode to normal and heroic. No more benching of players. This can be game changing.<br />
<br />
Indeed! Its a great concept, and a good way to test it out on live servers. If its not balanced properly then oh well it only drops sub-normal gear.<br />
<br />
And hey, if it works out then its a step in the right direction for old raid challenge modes. So be positive and quit your whinings!<br />
<br />
Or better yet, lodge your protests by not using it when it goes live. I dare you. And stop using LFR as well. Infact stop being a wimp and just do nothing bar heroic once you unlock it after week one. Play the game hardcore, don't farm normal modes if you get stuck on a hard boss, or stop your bellyaching!</div></div><hr />

Considering that it will be EASIER then Normal, it should also drop lower ilvl then normal.<br />

It wasn't answered, so I'm wondering- will it share a lockout with LFR, with Normal/Heroic, or seperate lockout? with Normal/Heroic, then I don't care about it for mains, but great for alts. With LFR, then its pretty good all-round. Seperate lockout entirely, and it becomes another timesink for gearing up for the first few weeks :(</div></div><hr />

I'd personally love to see flex work down to 5-man level or even allow solo content (but scale the items down to way below LFR - perhaps by as much as 20 points), but I imagine they won't allow that.<br />

Yeah guys lets take away wotlk style raiding where 10 man was rewarding lower ilvl loot by a fraction and was a little easier for people to play with their friends in in favour of sharing lockouts for 10 and 25. Then lets chuck in raid finder and make it compulsory to gear so that anyone who wants to raid has to do it to get anywhere in the first place. And now lets make ANOTHER mode of the same encounter when all we have done is whinge about how we can't balance 10 and 25 man to be equal in difficulty yet we now can miraculously with any number between 10 and 25...<br />
<br />
Seriously.. what the hell??<br />
<br />
What is there not to understand? <br />
<br />
There are guilds who raid 10 as hardcore as there are 25 guilds. Just because people don't want to commit to 25 doesn't mean the loot should be worse. A lot of players in top 10 man guilds are just as skilled if not more as top 25 man guilds, so why punish them? Blizzard realized that, and also noted that there's a lot more interest for smaller groups (10 men) as for (25 men) thus the gear was equalized and so were the raid difficulties too - before that 10 men raids were a lot easier compared to 25. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't want to raid 25s, but I still want a challenge and be adequately rewarded for completing that challenge, lower ilvl just feels like a punch in the face for doing the equivalently hard content as my fellow 25 raiders. I had my fair share of 25s, and I don't like it, you always miss people here there, guild repairs suck the bank dry in like couple of raids, you don't have much close contact with most members since there's just to many etc. <br />
<br />
But back then, when you wanted a challenge your only option was to find 24 other people and raid 25s, which a lot of people didn't like and started doing 10s even for worse loot, but most became vocal about 10s being too easy and the loot being crap - so Blizzard listened and did what they did. <br />
<br />
25/10 Normal/Heroic are fine as they are now, this new Flex mode is more than welcome for people who don't feel the need for a challenge and are under time constrains, not for people who want a challenge still but don't want to raid 25. It's fine, there's a bit messy with how many raid modes there is and how many levels of loot there is, but we'll get used to it like we did for every feature up until now.</div></div><hr />

I bet that's an eventual result. Back in Wrath there was ample opportunity to pug raids and the biggest limitation would often by that you could find 15 or 16 people, but not enough after, and then people start dropping, etc. With this, &quot;shout in trade&quot; for pugs works again and it can go with pretty much any reasonable composition. Renders Looking For Retards obsolete, hopefully.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First thought. wanna-be hardcores are going to complain about being forced to do another difficulty level. You know, the same fake-hardcores who are ´forced´to run LFR.<br />
<br />
My biggest excitment for this is not for those ´casual´ guilds.. it is for the semi-random puging. With the loot system they implemented, this will feel much more like doing world bosses. You can pug with one group one night, a different group for a different wing the next night.. and there will be no loot drama.<br />
<br />
IMHO.. this should replace normal modes, not LFR. LFR is still for the people who don´t want to form groups, or for realms that maybe can´t support a raid-pug.. but this really could just be normal mode. Heroic raiders blow through normal mode anyway..<br />
<br />
I don´t know. I totally guessed wrong about the new feature (thought it was going to be the abiltiy to scale down to run low level dungeons).. which was something that would not affect me much.<br />

Disappointed it doesn't support group sizes smaller than 10. Adding more lukewarm bodies isn't always hard, and speaking as someone who's already finished CMs, I want something I can do with the 4 people I like and not a ton of garbage pugs I keep on btag through stockholm syndrome.<br />

No it doesn't. <br />

If you are doing normal mode. Why are you in LFR? Normal mode is designed to be beaten with last tier's gear. Cheesing it with LFR gear is just being a wuss.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't answered, so I'm wondering- will it share a lockout with LFR, with Normal/Heroic, or seperate lockout? with Normal/Heroic, then I don't care about it for mains, but great for alts. With LFR, then its pretty good all-round. Seperate lockout entirely, and it becomes another timesink for gearing up for the first few weeks :(<br />
<br />
Did you read the announcement? The lockout will be independent of LFR and Normal/Heroic...</div></div><hr />

LFR is not required to raid, being a halfway decent person who isn't a halfwit when talking to other people is.

What's next? When can we expect the difficulty that is slightly more heroic than normal but not as hard as heroic? We have to cater to the semi-pros after all.<br />

The point is :<br />
<br />
Best gear = heroic<br />
Worst gear = lfr<br />
<br />
Easy = lfr<br />
Hard = heroic<br />

Who cares about how many tiers there are between heroic and lfr? As long as the ultimate goal is heroic gear and achievements it's fine.</div></div><hr />

Renders Looking For Retards obsolete, hopefully.<br />
<br />
Nah. Getting groups to kill world bosses on some servers is like pulling teeth. Stand around for half an hour spamming trade chat isn't exactly fun. LFR will still be needed as a &quot;reliable&quot; way to raid. Flex will be something the LFR crowd do on the side if a PUG raid starts up.</div></div><hr />

Most interested in the &quot;you can do the achievements in this difficulty&quot; part myself. Sounds like an awesome addition. I've often thought that if WoW started from scratch then something like this would be the way all raiding works.<br />
<br />
My only concerns are the complexity of having 4 difficulty levels (and 3 different sizes) and the ILVL bloat... although they did say they're going to slide the ILVL in between LFR and NM so... I wonder if they will expand the difference between LFR and NM to accomodate it or if the gap will stay the same.</div></div><hr />

Don't like it, don't do it. Please don't say it's to gear up for normal/heroic. Do those in normal/heroic gear from the previous tiers. Man up and stop trying to cheese the challenge. The challenge is why you are doing normal/heroic no?<br />

It's a real concern since they alread messed with LFR ilvl because of that. This will be required to run for normal/heroic raiders as LFR used to be.<br />

<br />
I'd much prefer size scaling<br />
Give the option to raid with x members where 6&lt;= x &lt;= 25<br />
and scale the enemies HP/Damage and loot in [5 member brackets]<br />
<br />
So<br />
6-10 members in raid?: You're raiding 10man (go with less than 10 if you're good, want to challenge yourself and have more chance at loot)<br />
11-15 members in raid? You're raiding 15man<br />
16-20 members in raid? You're raiding 20man<br />
20-25 members in raid? You're raiding 25man<br />
<br />
There's no setting for raid size, the raid adjusts to your group size automatically when you cross a subzone trigger before a raid boss.<br />
(think zone trigger dungeon quests, zone trigger events like gauntlets etc for the mechanism) <br />
<br />
Basically take what Blizz is doing now when scaling raids from 10 -&gt; 25 in terms of HP/dmg/loot, <br />
make it instead 4 brackets and make the raid adjust itself automatically to your raid group with no player setting for raid size.</div></div><hr />

If you question that, you're clueless.<br />
<br />
Ppl going for HM or even the harder Normal fights will want any kind of upgrade that they can manage to get. gap between LFR and Normal was increased for a reason.<br />
<br />
There will always be a OP tier set bonus, OP trinket effects, etc. that are totally worth farming for any kind of ilvl.<br />

If you take into consideration the ilvl upgrade feature + a higher ilvl than LFR (without sharing lockouts). Things will get crystal clear, even for you.</div></div><hr />

Same here. I want to get the same item level rewards from Normal so much, but when Blizzard used Looking For Retard as an excuse to up Normal to &quot;where it should've been&quot; (or so it's claimed), guess what? That really laid the hurt on raiding in general, even more so than the Cataclysm changes had. And this is their solution? To add yet another difficulty tier with sub-par gear as usual?<br />

Don't let that sentence misguide you I agree with you.<br />

Also, I can't help but think that this is something expected to bring back that &quot;niche&quot; that was 10man in WotLK, the expansion with the biggest number of subs, even thought I dont think that people is a &quot;niche&quot;, niche refers to a small ammount of elements in the sample, and I don't think that group was so small...</div></div><hr />

LFR isn't required. <br />

If you can't beat normal mode, tuned for normal mode gear, without &quot;help&quot; from LFR. Maybe the problem is between the chair and the keyboard. <br />

Nope since it's not the same raid lockout.<br />

It would be really stupid if they did it like that considering that they're designing linear raids.<br />

Can't wait to see the kind of mess it will be when they think about the mechanics and all the balance thing. They'll probably have to abandon some encounter mechanic ideas for example.<br />

And the fact that you can do glory of the raider achievements in it... not looking good. Totally stupid achievements since by default this new setting is easier than normal or even extra achievements... great :P</div></div><hr />

well it says part of your glory achievements, and those (since the introduction of hard modes / heroic modes) require heroic kills. So still you might manage to get some of those achievements but probably not all.</div></div><hr />

if you can't even get 10 man together, then it is not raiding you want, but challenge mode dungeons. That's why they added them.<br />

If you can't beat normal mode, tuned for normal mode gear, without &quot;help&quot; from LFR. Maybe the problem is between the chair and the keyboard. <br />
<br />
You should consider &quot;downgrading&quot; to flex when it comes out if you find normal &quot;too difficult&quot;. One shouldn't tap talents they don't have.<br />

I'm just saying it's your choice to do LFR. You don't have to. Blizzard doesn't required you too. LFR isn't part of the &quot;progression&quot;.<br />
<br />
You choose to do LFR, choose to cheese the fights. That's your choice to &quot;cheat&quot;. This is fact.<br />
<br />
PS: Gear gap between normal and LFR ... won't be surprise they increased it because Flex was already in the pipeline when they start itemising ToT.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also suggesting, that if you have so much trouble in normal that you have to resort to &quot;cheating&quot; - then whine about how much work is required to to &quot;cheat&quot; LOL. Just do Flex then. It's a game. Why kill yourself over it?<br />
<br />
Oh, and please don't compare yourself with top guilds who are trying to get world 1st heroic kills. They clear raids while being severely undergeared. Those guys entered 5.0 heroic raids in blues.<br />

<br />
Unfortunatelly it's not your choice when you're playing with others. That's a old lesson alread learned by so many years of MMOs out there.<br />
<br />
Remember. You farm all possible gear from 5man heroics to start raiding. You don't grab your quest gear and jump to raid. Even LFR ilvl requirement shows that. You need to grab anything you can to reach that ilvl to queue.<br />
<br />
And yes, LFR is part of the gear progression, Blizzard alread stated that anytime you need to fill a slot of gear that you could never get from normal mode or even heroic 5man (or previous raid tier since now we don't have new 5man heroics), you should try it from LFR. You're not cheating for using anything equal or lower than the normal mode ilvl. You would be &quot;cheating&quot; for using heroic gear in that.<br />
<br />
And that brought all this problem right back to them.<br />
<br />
Don't dream that they increased the gap because of a future flex mode. Ppl alread asked why and they alread answered that it was an atempt to make LFR gear less atractive to normal raiders. There will always be a OP tier bonus, OP trinket effect, etc.<br />
<br />
Just check the gear lists from class/specs, you will find LFR trinkets ranking higher than a lot of &quot;this should be next in the rank&quot; trinkets. Because it doesn't matter the ilvl, the effect is insane anyways.<br />
<br />
Even weapons (and you can't deny that for some classes, weapon is everything). So why you're wasting your time and your raid team member's time using that 463/450 weapon when you could farm one from LFR instead of waiting forever for one to drop in normal (not to mention that weapon could go for another player with the same bad luck since you could grab one just a little bit lower from LFR)?</div></div><hr />

Thats your opinion? Where id LFR fail tell me that. Yea its dumbed down, but ppl were asking for a easy way to raid and blizzard gave them just that.<br />
<br />
And in the end i didnt say everything added to the game is great but what i did say was at least give them time to form it to something good.<br />
<br />
Personally i dont see anything wrong with LFR.<br />
<br />
What i dont do is bitch about things like you do aka i dont mind pokemon beeing in the game, i dont care about it and you know what?<br />
I dont even touch that part of the game, just like pvp. Its diffirent parts of the game, some ppl love pokemon and some love pvp.<br />

<br />
Try to see it in a positive way instead.<br />
<br />
You can find those 2-3 pugs to do the flexible mode 10 man and maybe just maybe youll find 2-3 new players to your roster. Dont have to see everything negative. There are probably ALOT of players that are stuck between lfr and normals atm. They will get a chance to rise through this system.

Fix servers and most of the issues with this and fielding the appropriate amount to begin with will go away besides the gearing issue which made me laugh a little. <br />

<br />
Exactly, if you cleared last tier, then LFR and probably Flex will offer you no real upgrades. Any guild that forces you to spend 3 hours for the hopes that you upgrade your bracer from 496 to 502 should just fall apart anyway.<br />
<br />
To be honest, a guild would be much better off if they forced their members to watch videos of the rights rather than doing something they hate for 3 hours for a very minimal upgrade. And this ´real raiders will do anything possible to get better gear´ is nonsense. Unless you are going for world first, you don´t have to kill yourself</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SodiumChloride</div><div class="date">2013-06-07, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunatelly it's not your choice when you're playing with others. That's a old lesson alread learned by so many years of MMOs out there.<br />
<br />
Remember. You farm all possible gear from 5man heroics to start raiding. You don't grab your quest gear and jump to raid. Even LFR ilvl requirement shows that. You need to grab anything you can to reach that ilvl to queue.<br />
<br />
And yes, LFR is part of the gear progression, Blizzard alread stated that anytime you need to fill a slot of gear that you could never get from normal mode or even heroic 5man (or previous raid tier since now we don't have new 5man heroics), you should try it from LFR. You're not cheating for using anything equal or lower than the normal mode ilvl. You would be &quot;cheating&quot; for using heroic gear in that.<br />
<br />
And that brought all this problem right back to them.<br />
<br />
Don't dream that they increased the gap because of a future flex mode. Ppl alread asked why and they alread answered that it was an atempt to make LFR gear less atractive to normal raiders. There will always be a OP tier bonus, OP trinket effect, etc.<br />
<br />
Just check the gear lists from class/specs, you will find LFR trinkets ranking higher than a lot of &quot;this should be next in the rank&quot; trinkets. Because it doesn't matter the ilvl, the effect is insane anyways.<br />
<br />
Even weapons (and you can't deny that for some classes, weapon is everything). So why you're wasting your time and your raid team member's time using that 463/450 weapon when you could farm one from LFR instead of waiting forever for one to drop in normal (not to mention that weapon could go for another player with the same bad luck since you could grab one just a little bit lower from LFR)?<br />
<br />
Maybe you should find a better guild with a less &quot;hardcore&quot; attitude ...<br />
<br />
If what you say is true, Blizzard is even trying to discourage normal mode raiders from farming LFR with the ilvl gap. LFR should be the last resort if a weapon refuses to drop - since everything else can be either bought or crafted. <br />
<br />
Remember, you don't need LFR gear to clear normal. I repeat, it's your (and your guild's) choice to cheese normal with LFR gear. <br />
<br />
PS: Sorry if I come across as a troll. I was trolling a little by playing along with self-proclaimed superiority of the typical raider that whines about LFR on these forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you want 2 tanks 2 healers and 2 DPS? Too much boss health = snore-fest for healers. Too little boss health = mana never an issue, there is still *SOME* kind of requirement on how many mimimum players you need in a raid. <br />
<br />
I cant beleive people even bother to comment here without thinking two steps ahead. Let me tell you what will happen once 5.4 is released.<br />
<br />
- guilds that will do this NEW raid difficutily will probably recruit between 15-25 people. HENCE they can always raid cuz they will ahve between 10-25 people online.<br />
so those of you who want it scaled down to 7 or something. Just merge with another guild. Or stick to LFR/5 mans if you are THAT casual in logistics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for wanting it to scale below 10, there are probably logistical considerations -- fights still needing two tanks etc -- that make it easier to set that as the lower bound. The whole point of this is to pug a bunch of people from trade and get better stuff than LFR.<br />
It's not, they said the &quot;new feature&quot; will cater around old content.</div></div><hr />

Here's how to improve it: remove 10 man normal, remove 25man normal, add flex size normal. Done.<br />
<br />
Screw 4 ilvl tiers, 3 lockouts and 4 difficulties.<br />
<br />
This is what I expect the next expansion to be. It is going to go LFR, Flex 10/25 Normal, Flex 10/25 Heroic.<br />

LFR hit in Cata, then went for everything in MoP. I expect this to hit in MoP, then go everything for the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And in the end i didnt say everything added to the game is great but what i did say was at least give them time to form it to something good.<br />
<br />
Personally i dont see anything wrong with LFR.<br />
<br />
What i dont do is bitch about things like you do aka i dont mind pokemon beeing in the game, i dont care about it and you know what?<br />
I dont even touch that part of the game, just like pvp. Its diffirent parts of the game, some ppl love pokemon and some love pvp.<br />
<br />
Why do you even bitch about lfr? Arent you raiding normal or heroics? Really dont get it<br />
<br />
I guess you could easily go and back track some news posts from MMOChampion and blue posts from Blizzard. They've got all your answers about &quot;why LFR failed&quot; covered. From Killing guilds groups, going into killing social aspect of a Multiplayer game (social! shocking!), passing by not letting ppl see the stuff since it's all about &quot;GO GO GO GO YOU TARDS!!!&quot; and not correctly preparing for normal raiding.<br />
<br />
You're saying it's &quot;bitching&quot;, wich is not, and by the way, crying out about &quot;bitching&quot; is one of the lowest things someone can do, showing their lack of arguments. (finishing with &quot;arent you normal/heroics?&quot; is even worse).<br />
<br />
Guess we reached the point were we can say wotlk ppl are just thinking of it with &quot;rose-tinted glasses&quot; and pure nostalgia like classic/tbc players. Raiding there wasn't all that happiness and perfect. There was bad players just like there are now. Pugs failed a lot in 10 man mode (&quot;perfect&quot; pugs were mostly, guess what? Formed from 25 man raid players trying to get specific itens from 10, because, we need to be honest, things were worse then since 10 and 25 mode had diferent loot, not only diferent ilvl. So you could have your BiS trinket in 10 instead of 25 for example). And almost all 25man pugs failboated before saurfang (4th boss) in icc for example.<br />

For 10 man you need 2 tanks 3 heals and 5 dps<br />

Seems like a lot of complexity/confusion to understand how many additional healers, dps you need to be successful with flexible sizes between 10 and 25<br />

Will be interesting to see how this pans out<br />

Might be simpler to re implement the wrath 10/25 mans with separate lockouts... heck they still do that for china... although I know this would not address group sizes between 10 and 25</div></div><hr />

You dont work at blizzard, you dont know shit about how this will evolve or have an impact on the game so stop acting like it.<br />
The overall negative energy just makes me puke sometimes. Jesus see some positive things. <br />

Raiding has evovled, if its cause blizzard made normals hard ot whatever it doesnt matter. Clearly this is game changing if it ends up beeing like<br />
<br />
LFR<br />
Normal Flexible<br />
Heroic Flexible<br />
<br />
as its probably might end up in the next expansion. It will open up a whole new dynamic to raiding.<br />

PS: Sorry if I come across as a troll. I was trolling a little by playing along with self-proclaimed superiority of the typical raider that whines about LFR on these forums.<br />
<br />
Ok, let's all ditch our friends, bye bye, because they asked you to do something. Like asking you to also help them in LFR (to avoid so much bad players making them stack determination istead of killing the boss 1st time), or now even in flex mode. &quot;No guys, sry, i only raid once, don't want to go again&quot; good job dude.<br />
<br />
We all could say &quot;dude, just find a better guild with less bad players, so you could finally down normal bosses&quot;. Wouldn't you tell me that you shouldn't ditch your friends just because they're bad enough to not kill the normal mode boss?<br />
<br />
As Blizzard alread stated so many times, it's their job to be the ones imposing some limits, to avoid this kind of thing. Instead of having ppl arguing, fighting, etc. about that inside the guilds, they just put limits like valor caps, 10/25 lockouts, huge gap between LFR and Normal ilvl, etc.<br />
<br />
Lower ilvl gear isn't cheesing, stop saying that, it's kinda of stupid since cheesing something means outgearing/outleveling it.<br />
<br />
You're not out leveling something with lower ilvl. It's higher than heroic 5man gear and lower than Normal mode gear. It's fair game. Or you would be cheesing by entering T15 with T14 gear. See?<br />
<br />
Grabbing valor gear would be cheesing. It's not normal mode drop.<br />
<br />
See?<br />
<br />
In a ideal world you don't need most of the things in the game. You don't need to do dailies, you don't need to do LFR, you don't need to do heroic 5man, you don't need to cap valor... (you don't need normal mode gear if your thing is just &quot;LFRing&quot; and &quot;dailying&quot; and sitting in your capital city since we're at what you don't need or need).<br />
<br />
But... do we live in a ideal world? Guess not.</div></div><hr />

It is an option, but not the intent behind the 4 different Raid Levels. LFR is for seeing content and not having to worry about the details of the raid comp and who isnt doing their job. This Friends/Family casual type raid lock out is for everyone who wants to raid but can't commit to a real raiding guild/group due to time restrictions. Normal is for your average daily player who can be at a raid every week without an issue, and Heroic is for the elites who want difficult content and a challenge. However, I think they could have accomplished the same goal with 3 raid levels. Personally, I think instead of introducing this new raid tech into its own level they should have just rolled into into the current raid system and removed the 10/25 designation all together(but keeping the 10 min and 25 max in places) but just having the raids scale based on the number in the raid group.</div></div><hr />

Now if they allow this flexibility in just Normal as well, I'd be pretty happy. Keep Heroic locked at 10/25 with realm-only; let Normal be 10-25 region-wide too :(</div></div><hr />

The only group this really gives any benefit to, is people who already do Normal raids, but don't want to deal with LFR, but want to gear up the rest of the guild. This is basically a fix for having two separate 10m raid groups, and moving 10m raiding out of LFR.<br />
<br />
I doubt many people who aren't in a raiding guild have 10+ people on their friends list, who are 90, who are on at the same time, who also want to actually raid.<br />
<br />
If it were smaller, say 4-7 people? I'd be stoked (though it still doesn't seem to be a groundbreaking thing), because THEN more people might be interested, but the 10+ feature just seems to cater to a staggeringly small audience.</div></div><hr />

Not that I think anyone needs to or should do all three, but there will be people that will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will be very interesting how this will work though, take Lei-shen for example; in 25man like 6 blue soaks spawn per platform, in 10man like 2, so what will be cutoff be, will 12 man raid spawn 1 more? or 13 etc? Will be hard to really balance.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Somebody</div><div class="date">2013-06-07, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a really cool feature, but it won't bring me back to WoW. The friends I used to have had all stopped playing in Cataclysm and ever since LFR I have never really felt the need raid with guild in normal mode 10 or 25. I was in a big guild for a while and we raided 10 man, but I never really knew the players in the guild so raiding with them wasn't fun or adventurous, I was just there to help out.<br />
<br />
Well if this is the new feature, then I feel this will benefit current players, but it doesn't benefit those who have quit. Frankly, I don't see how this feature is fun, its really only helpful for when 25m raids are short and when 10m raids have several people who really want to go on bench.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twerking As Intended</div><div class="date">2013-06-07, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can understand why it's a separate difficulty: if it was applied to normal/heroic raiding we'd eventually see an end to 25man raiding. However I don't see how it will resolve the ongoing issue of dwindling realm populations, both caused by and contributing to a lack of normal/heroic raid progression. It may actually discourage players from trying normal/heroic content.<br />
<br />
Also consider how it would exacerbate the current issues of:<br />
<br />
balancing 10man and 25man content,<br />
the gearing process aimed towards normal/heroic endgame,<br />
the tedious comparisons of loot in multiple tiers/modes, <br />
the challenge of finding enough healers based on the raid's size<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
25man guilds could see it as an alternative in case they can't fill their rosters. On the other hand, I don't think a 10man guild, which is experienced with normal/heroic raiding and only raids 2-3 nights a week, would sacrifice a progressive raid night for a lower level of difficulty and loot just to accomodate a couple extra guildies.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how it will work, but my first thoughts are that this could bring smaller guilds together for some fun times.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eschatological</div><div class="date">2013-06-07, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they should open this up below 10 people. I think 10 people teams with constantly only 7-9 people on during raid night should expand their circle of friends a little bit. One of the main detriments of having a &quot;bench&quot; in friends/family type groups is you don't want anyone to feel left out. Now? Not an issue. Have 15 people in your team, say &quot;Show up Tuesday at 9 to raid.&quot; All 15 show up? Great. 12 show up? No problem. 10 show up? Still good to go. But if you can't get 2/3rds of your group, which presumably got together with the desire to actually raid together, to show up, then yes, maybe you should cancel the raid night.<br />
<br />
As a heroic raider, all this means for me is we can do our meta achievements with our full roster (14 ppl) and not lose a heroic kill to guarantee the achiev on normal mode. Plus, we won't ever have to balance again for &quot;Oh, I need in to get this achievement...&quot; now we just need to balance our comp for gear soaking. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For 10 man you need 2 tanks 3 heals and 5 dps<br />
What do you need for 12 man? 15 man? 20 man?<br />
<br />
Seems like a lot of complexity/confusion to understand how many additional healers, dps you need to be successful with flexible sizes between 10 and 25<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually since the difficulty scales linearly, after 10-man you would add 1 healer for every 4 non-heals. Just keep the same proportion it is in 10-man. Sooo..<br />
<br />
15 man = 2 tanks, 3 heals, 10 dps... <br />
20 man = 2 tanks, 4 heals, 14 dps...<br />
<br />
11 man you use 2 heals.. <br />
12 man you use 2 heals..<br />
13 man you use 3 heals..<br />
14 man you use 3 heals..<br />
etc..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seefer</div><div class="date">2013-06-07, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a pretty good idea but I can't help but feel it's accomplishing what LFR tried to accomplish but in a much better way. It's a great way for the PuGs and the social players to get to see the raid content.<br />
<br />
However, I think 4 difficulty levels is too many. This thing is like LFR but way better in every way. It has all the strengths of the accessibility - especially with it being &quot;flexible and cross server&quot;. However, it also doesn't let people play like utter crap and escape all social responsibility.<br />
<br />
This is what LFR should have been, and I applaud it for that reason alone. LFR needs to be axed, though. It was pretty bad.<br />
<br />
I agree with this whore heartedly.</div></div><hr />

And i only do LFR on my alts, it has its place atm. I would say there are things missing more then saying lfr is a failure. But yea i think its here our thoughts are seperated. <br />
And yea there IS a difference about bitching (you were bitching) and giving constructive feedback.<br />
<br />
You dont work at blizzard, you dont know shit about how this will evolve or have an impact on the game so stop acting like it.<br />
The overall negative energy just makes me puke sometimes. Jesus see some positive things. <br />
<br />
Raiding has evovled, if its cause blizzard made normals hard ot whatever it doesnt matter. Clearly this is game changing if it ends up beeing like<br />
<br />
LFR<br />
Normal Flexible<br />
Heroic Flexible<br />
<br />
as its probably might end up in the next expansion. It will open up a whole new dynamic to raiding.<br />
<br />
Dynamic is usually good when a game is dropping in subs.<br />
<br />
Sorry, it wasn't bitching, because if it was, it would be no more, no less than you. Were you bitching?<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly, this isn't the right place for constructive feedback, since this isn't Blizzard foruns, so yes... it's just discussing about it.<br />
<br />
I also do LFR on my alts since I don't want to bother with pugging things just for an alt (I don't get pissed because another guy has better gear on his, let's say, monk, than I have on my monk alt, but clearly tons of players do get), but unfortunatelly had to run LFR on my main a few times for the extra legendary quest item drops (and thankfully they made it shared drop later. And you can bet some ppl complained that they now don't have the freedom of choice to run both LFR and Normal/Heroic for extra quest items) or the final set piece for a stupid OP set bonus because everyone else asked for it &quot;dude, that set bonus could really help, it's OP and it would be one less rolling on it when it drops, could you try to get it from LFR please?&quot;. Sure I could just go asshole mode &quot;no, screw you all&quot;. But... anyway.<br />
<br />
The game now is even faster than before. So you can't just sit there waiting for a drop in normal/heroic if the next content is almost out there. And if you don't care about killing boss X or Y before it's over, then why even care about after finishing the story in LFR or anything else? You're lying to yourself if you're stepping into normals or even heroics and saying you have the same mentality of a guy who just log, do a few pew pew here and there between dailies, random bgs and lfr and logoff.<br />
<br />
The game is old. Ppl do get tired after 7 years. MMO genre as a whole is going down. Trying any crazy idea isn't going to bring players back to gold times. One thing that wotlk taught us and you can be damn sure it's right is that getting burn out is one of the fastest ways to get ppl leaving the game.</div></div><hr />
