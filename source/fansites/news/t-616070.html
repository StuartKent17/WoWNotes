Icecrown/Arthas Cinematic<br />
I don't really like to spoil lore, and the video below contains A LOT of spoilers. This is the cinematic related to the Arthas/Icecrown storyline, we didn't really talk about this kind of lore on the front page because I don't think it's useful to spoil it, it kinda breaks the fun (especially in WotLK where a lot of work has been done on the lore)<br />
<br />
Watch the video at your own risks - Download Link (http://files.filefront.com/WOW+Wrathgate+1024avi/;11881764;/fileinfo.html) (No embed yet, don't want people to click it without reading) <br />

Sylvanas has betrayed the Horde, and the Alliance. <br />
<br />
It is now the scourge vs the forsaken (and their new plague). The Alliance and the Horde have been thrown in the middle. Sylvanas just doesn't want the scourge destroyed, she wants to destroy the living races (&quot;death to the scourge and death to the living&quot;). <br />
<br />
This seriously sucks.<br />

This is not the case at all. There has always been a speculation that the Royal Apothecarial Society had been creating a plague to destroy the living without Sylvannas' knowledge of blessing. Now we know that this is true with the Battle for the Undercity questline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vigilance changed from 5% dodge to 3% less damage taken, nothing major but a small common sense buff.<br />
<br />
Storm Earth and Fire changed from a 10% LB coef. buff to a 2.5 second CD reduction on Chain Lightning. I haven't spotted(yet) any other talent having the LB buff folded into it, so unless the base numbers were changed(and even then) we're looking at an elemental nerf.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is. There are some videos on BlizzPlanet that shows you the whole quest line where Varimatrhas betrays the Horde and You along with Thrall, Vol'Jin and Sylvanas are reclaiming the Undercity.<br />

It's true that he expects her to attack him, but he mistook the rogue faction of the Forsaken for the real McCoy. That's why he said her name.</div></div><hr />

speculation? Most of the early RAS quests have you testing things out on living things to see that the development plague actually works. What it didn't work on up to now are actual scourge. Also, there is a short quest chain that starts at the tower to the east of Darkshire where you kill a human informant to cover up the dealing of the RAS. The intention of the new plague has been known from the very beginning.<br />

<br />
1. Sylvanas isnt the one betraying, its Varimathras and Putress that are betraying.<br />
<br />
2. The Alliance finds out about the plans to kill everything and make the Forsaken the only race alive (as far as you can call it alive). So the King of Stormwind attacks Undercity (Alliance Battle for Undercity questline) to kill Putress.<br />
<br />
3. Thrall and Sylvanas dont know about this &quot;plan&quot; to kill everything, and they just want to take the city back from Varimathras.<br />
<br />
4. Alliance and Horde will meet in Undercity as part of the Questline and it is there that the King of the Alliance declaires war with the Horde (he is kinda pissed of because he was forced to be a Gladiator slave for the orcs).<br />
<br />
5. The red dragonflight burns down all the corpses so that they cant be &quot;ressurected&quot; for the scourge.<br />
<br />

If a level 10 player knows what is going on in the storyline, then it isn't much of a secret what the RAS is up to. Sylvannas suddenly caring about all the non-high elf living races &lt;edit&gt; and more importantly, not having a clue about what is going on &lt;/edit&gt; is a major retcon imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How the hell does that work or even mean?<br />
<br />
i asked myself the same question. maybe now it's some kind of debuff you automaticly put on a mob if you hit him (not like using ability and so on) but that doesn't sound right either...<br />
and man...i don't now. they change paladins like: -nerfing substained dps with the seal changes, then give them more burst with the crit changes and then again buffing there substained dps with the 2h-specialisation...<br />
and somehow i can't find the buff of hammer of righteous that they announced to make them &quot;let the warlock take the spelldmg weapon again&quot; or something like that...</div></div><hr />

You sunder something(by using the ability, it's not becoming some retarded buff or whatever you people are pulling out of your asses), and it stays sundered.</div></div><hr />

That would really be an idiotic change if true, since the damage (and thus the threat) generated by devastate is dependent on having sunder armor stacked on the target.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sylvanas has betrayed the Horde, and the Alliance. <br />
<br />
It is now the scourge vs the forsaken (and their new plague). The Alliance and the Horde have been thrown in the middle. Sylvanas just doesn't want the scourge destroyed, she wants to destroy the living races (&quot;death to the scourge and death to the living&quot;). <br />
<br />
This seriously sucks.<br />
<br />
A huge plot twist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sylvanas did not betray the Horde. Ever since the original WOW launched, she's been having her Apothecaries engineer a plague meant to specifically destroy the Scourge. Apparently, the Apothecaries, under Putress, engineered one that would destroy all life instead. Varimathras and Putress used this ambush to both usurp control of the Forsaken and to start a war between the Horde and the Alliance.<br />
<br />
The only reason the Lich King mutters Sylvanas' name is because he knows she's out for vengeance and not even he could fathom that she'd presumably go to such extreme lengths to exact it. This was an attack meant to cause mass confusion between the Horde, Alliance, and the Scourge, which plays right into Varimathras' plans to take total leadership of the Forsaken.</div></div><hr />

I think it suits her. She was a dragon before she was an aspect, and she is pretty powerful.</div></div><hr />

Also anybody notice the Forsaken is wearing a Warlock set? I posted it on the official forums and got banned, it doesn't seem to be t7 so I'm guessing its the T8 set which if it is SUCKS!</div></div><hr />

Oh my that sounds wrong, but i love it...<br />
<br />
Varians swords...<br />
The dk mount looks as good but rather similar to the charger now.<br />
And sylvanas looks much better now, beautiful in a deathly way, much more like my view of a high elf banshee :)</div></div><hr />

You sure that won't mean that it simply doesn't allow you to drop other totems? :P <br />
<br />
I hope it's as you say though, just worried by Blizz's ambiguous wording at times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a simple change really, any relic acts as your 4 totems whether it is equipped or not. Tested on my level 70 beta character.<br />
<br />
I was able to switch relics while the totems were down, unequip my relics, etc. When I put ALL my relics and totems in the bank, I was not able to drop totems.</div></div><hr />

HE IS (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sargeras)<br />

And &quot;distant voice&quot; make me think to he, aswell as the voice in the head (http://www.wowwiki.com/The_Diary_of_High_General_Abbendis) of High General Abbendis<br />
<br />
<br />
Reading helps.<br />
<br />
Copy-paste:<br />
<br />
Kil'jaeden the Deceiver is ..... Since the apparent banishment of Sargeras, he has assumed the role of supreme commander.<br />
<br />
Sargeras is the *founder* of the burning legion, but he isn't the *leader* because he is AWOL right now. We only know that he is banished in the Twisting Nether unable to contact anyone.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Now please don't whine about it, there were enough people whining about the first edition of these being available through badges ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the questline after the movie makes heavy use of Phasing, and the final quest rewards are blues (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?quest=13267), I guess it's safe to assume you will be able to do that quest even a year after launch.</div></div><hr />
