Except for poor Warriors and Druids (LOL).<br />

Although they did dominate season 1,2,3 and 4, so they cant really complain :)<br />

I play Hunter, and i lol at the fact 99% of the Rogues are skilless after seeing RMP's dominating these charts. All the QQing that has been going around from Rogues, Priests, Warlocks are false :D and thats funny to me. No matter what u say, this made my day.<br />

<br />
wow pvp will never be really balanced...it is more balanced now then alot of you think though<br />
<br />
and enough of this stupid crap about u.s. being flavor of the month...does anybody think about that hey maybe the good players actually play that comp because they want to win(and well they might just like that comp and they are very skilled players and since that comp is naturally good....then of course they are going to win)....and don't give me some crap about face rolling...you don't facerole your way to winning an arena tournament..while dk-pally-whatever is definately a little(one could actually argue very in place of a little) overpowered there is no reason any 3 skilled players couldn't beat them</div></div><hr />

<br />
That clearly is a sign. Like a bright light at the end of a tunnel that foretells better times to come. I have a feeling that embracing all the little changes to our and other classes we shall once more rise to hamstring and mortal strike our way to victory. ;)<br />
<br />
And yes, the above poster is right. You need the skill weather your class is a bit stronger in the given metagame or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Blizzard said they balance around 3s. ::)<br />
<br />
ouf right... i imagine you were playing a warrior or resto druid or warlock...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't pvp cos i'm crap at it, but what's the skill factor in this season? Are the players at the top people that would be there whatever class is strongest, or is the class imbalance in pvp overruling skill?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymrohd</div><div class="date">2009-04-09, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also suck at PvP but judging by the fact that as the tournament progressed class representation got a better distribution, i'd probably guess skill is the more of a factor than class imbalance. I'd rather see a bigger sample though, Top 10 is too small. I'd want to see a Top 20 or even better a top 5%.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-04-09, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wasn't a conspiracy theory. Just stating how smart companies make thier MMO games work.<br />
<br />
Your arguemnt fell apart when you made the assumption DK's were OP btw. (because this statement was your opinion, not based on any factual evidence)<br />
<br />
In fact the &quot;official tournament stats&quot; show that they arent anywhere close to being OP.<br />
<br />
The rest of your statements could loosley be argued as being correct though, bar a few things. For example if lets say preists dominated in population numbers, it might not necessarily mean they are most enjoyable, it could mean a number of different things. Maybe you need priests to complete certain game challenges, or maybe people rolled priest at the start of their game time and simply not rerolled.<br />
<br />
I know more than one Shamen who plays Shamen simply for the fact he/she rolled one to help complete Sunwell easier. And has been playing it ever since, and not necessarily because he/she enjoys it the most.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ye i edited my post so im saying they should balance classes while keeping in mind of the population :). But claiming DKs are not OP is like saying icecream doesnt melt in the sun tbh.<br />
Made a new team yesterday pala/dk/hunt never played together before, 48 games played and allready 2k rated within 1 hour. We are good players, but comon things never were THIS easy.<br />
If players want to populate a sertian class wich is not fun to play or is nerfed to shit, its their choise. Blizzard would not know if the players are unhappy about it, thats why the forums trolls are active.<br />
<br />
And playing shaman/priest only to help out on sertain challenges, well thats why theyve taken the road of &quot;bring the player not the class&quot;. A good thing for the players that can finally ditch their boring shaman. The population of Shaman would then drop though, giving a signal that maybe shamans arent as fun to play. (just an example).<br />
<br />
But i doubt they buff a class just to populate it. Thats what i got from your 1st post. I hope they buff a class because its not competetive in PVP/PVE. <br />
(thats why Rogues dont get buffs! get it?)</div></div><hr />

Everyone knows this. However very interesting to see a resto druid in the top 6 teams in EU with a very strange setup. (Dru, Warr, Lock)<br />

<br />
You statem Shamans are boring, yet many people also enjoy them. (I happen to think they are good fun too).<br />
<br />
Buffing a class because they arent competitive almost alwyas comes hand in hand with their population numbers anyway. (ie people dont play a class they cant compete with, which naturally decreases population numbers therefore justification for a buff).<br />
<br />
And dont get us started on rogues :)<br />
<br />
Rogues have dominated in one form or another every single season of PvP. Including season 5. Many many people play rogue. Most rogue opponenets dont enjoy being stunned to death. That means the chances of rogue getting PvP buffed atm is virtually zero :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think we are agreeing on the same thing :D population and competition = balance. And about shamans being boring, that was just an example since you said u know ppl that play shaman to overcome sertain challenges, that seems kinda odd to me. If you dont like a class, dont play it.. the numbers in population will show.<br />
How you said it in your last post seems correct to me, but previously you said: &quot;they balance classes around population. Why do you think new classes are powerful when they are first relased.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanne bet even if DKs were a complete shit class it still would get populated insanly fast, because its something new.<br />
And yes Rogues do not need buffs at all, neither do priests, warlocks and mages. And hunters dont need nerfs, but that ship has allready sailed.</div></div><hr />

2k is nothing these days. Almost everyone below 2k are bad players, or have at least 1 really bad player on their team that you can exploit.<br />
<br />
You can faceroll to 2k with 3 good players as long as you're not something dumb like 3 healers (3 dps is a good bit more difficult, but I'm sure 3 good players can get to 2k with it).<br />
<br />
Getting into glad range is a lot more difficult.<br />

Strange for WotLK. It was the definition of FOTM before 3.0 came out. WLD was probably the most OP you could get in TBC, considering it came into being as a strategy to beat RMP, the long standing champ before WLD arose.<br />
<br />
That warlock is Inflame, a sponsored player who won multiple LAN tournaments with that exact comp in 2007 and 2008. I wouldn't be surprised if the other 2 players are the rest of Nihilum Plazma, which means they are all players of the highest caliber, AND extremely familiar with the comp's playstyle.</div></div><hr />

Well 2k isnt hard i agree. You forget however only a handfull of ppl can actually obtain it. Glad rank in 3v3 = 2220 on my BG, and require rank 1/33. Atm im ranked 150 after 1 hour playing, and am sure to get glad in the next 6 days left of S5.<br />
Conclusion could be, my bg is bad, thousands of ppl are bad, the players in my team are good, or the classes in my team are OP. I think its a combination of a few factors.<br />
Whatever satisfy your needs, doesnt take away that almost everyone is below 2k ratings, and only a few thousand (compared to millions) are above 2k. Just because you are good doesnt mean others are bad.</div></div><hr />

As crappy as arms damage is, they do bring a higher percent of immobilizes from hamstring which helps with the peel factor. The benefit of having a reliable MS (cuz honestly lol@furious attacks) is quite significant.</div></div><hr />

The bigger chunk of classes are more or less equal in representation, however having two classes over-represented (DKs and pallys) and two classes under-represented (druids and warriors) doesn't fare too well in my book. Nice way of sending out a clear message:<br />
<br />
- Roll class A or class B to insta-win<br />

<br />
<br />
I look at it this way. Druids got a double whammy in WotLK to make sure they didnt dominate in arena, but instead made them under-represented.<br />
1) Form shifting is increasingly more punishing now<br />
2) Over-representation of DKs makes druid healing nearly impossible (plague strike)<br />
<br />
Warriors - have always always always had survivability issues. Why bring a warrior when a ret pally or DK offers better survivability + added utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I would say a lot of the kneejerk reactions and just regular old &quot;we feel bad for X class, lets buff them to hell&quot; by Blizzard are responsible for warriors and Druids being under-represented in S5. It is just not fun to play one nowadays - they are ineffective compared to others.</div></div><hr />

I don't pvp cos i'm crap at it, but what's the skill factor in this season? Are the players at the top people that would be there whatever class is strongest, or is the class imbalance in pvp overruling skill? <br />
<br />
<br />
Well since there are a limited number of classes, and they will inevitably meet the same team make up more than once throughout the tournament, skill will always be the deciding factor when it comes to this kind of thing regardless if certain classes are overpowered or not.</div></div><hr />

Viewing these chats make me feel like Death Knights and Paladins really don't need the &quot;nerf bat&quot; like people are saying. Somewhat yes, but a major beating like many are asking for no. These charts prove that other team builds have found ways to beat the current cookie cutter without the nerf. Death Knights are new, it is a lot easier to find ways to beat people with the new class than it is to beat the new class at first.<br />
<br />
IMO this tournament has proven that all classes (maybe druids and warriors need some help still) are able to compete. The level of ability has, again, won out the top seeds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
8 Pally, warlocks, 7 DK, 6 hunters,mages, priests, rogue, shamans. Hardly &quot;overrepresentation of DKs&quot;. Yes, warriors and druids are underrepresented, but they are THERE. Apparently at least 3 ppl know how to play that class. Oh..and we talk 60 players of millions. Obviously there are classes that are easier to play and thus are attractive to more players.<br />
<br />
To whoever said it is easy to reach a 2000 rating. Well...obviously it is impossible for everyone to have a 2000 rating, because for somebody to win, somebody else has to lose. There is no way everybody can have a 2000 rating, so it is a cheap claim to say everyone who has a 2000 rating is bad. Maybe everyone at 2000 is good, at 2300 excellent and below 1000 bad. Most people are mediocre....which is the why we have words like &quot;normal&quot; because it just represents the majority..the unwashed masses, the average Joe^^</div></div><hr />

Druid lacks a kick, escape spells and most of all, a healing debuff.<br />
<br />
Yeah, feral druids prop have bit higher burst than a rogue, but lacks many tools to have succes. Burst isn't everything.</div></div><hr />

Restos didn't dominate four seasons it was mainly S3 and a bit of S4. Season 1-2 barely count since it was all new and people were most fooling around, it was in S3 when people started focusing on ratings and arena points.<br />
<br />
Clearly pvp is about exploiting any advantage your character has over another, very rarely can a pro enhancement shaman beat a pro Death Knight(ofc it happens once in a while but on average)<br />
<br />
Did the rogues and warriors lose skill from season 3/4 to season 5? no they didnt lose their skill or their reflexes slowed down, their ability to exploit another character was either removed or countered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the way i see it, the only reason the numbers are swayed so highly in favor of paladin/dk is because everybody and their mother has a DK and anybody who even read about WOTLK beta knew that paladins were buffed to extreme and re-rolled paladin.<br />
<br />
thats why there are plenty of pally/dk .. add to it skilled players behind the characters then you have a killer combo...<br />
<br />
does this mean that all other classes are shit? no, again look at the numbers... those same people rolling DK/Pala were probably the exact same people rolling Warrior/Druid... i bet if you get a graph like that made for pre-wotlk arena you will see that there are very few paladins and duh, no DK's...<br />
<br />
also the fact that A druid or warrior made it that far.. means they are doing something right.. and &quot;U R DOIN IT WRONG!&quot;<br />

Hunter is most definitely a part of the current FotM. Not as much as pally/DK, but sham/hunt certantly ain't far behind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silvytreehug</div><div class="date">2009-04-09, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone who only pvped casually before wrath, i gotta say this data is a visual representation of what ive been qqing over recently.<br />
<br />
I have 2 characters who are 80 and ready for bgs and they are a Druid and a Warrior. Pvp had pretty much no influence on why i chose these characters. <br />
<br />
Every time i open my mouth, everyone launches into the whole &quot;qq you are a druid and dominated pvp up til now. no free gladiator qq&quot; <br />
<br />
Well, every non-druid who thinks druids are op or ever were should really try playing one before they say anything. The form switching is extremely hard to get perfect every time, and perfection is what it demands. Pallys have it soooo much easyer. Personally i wish paladins had to like, switch stances or something akin to form switching if they wanted to heal, costing mana and reducing defenses greatly.<br />
<br />
So i always loved seeing the best of the best pvp druids dominating. Like any delicate art form, when a druid is played perfectly it seems unkillable. I love the thought that people play druids BECAUSE they are hard and still capable of dominating.<br />
<br />
It's been said plenty before, but heres my two sense again for balancing:<br />
1 - plague strike does THREE things at once, melee damage, disease, and removes a hot. Thats just insulting. <br />
2 - paladins can stun/sap from a distance. ive never played a pally so i really dont know everything, but seems like they should be melee range for that.<br />
3 - the bubble/heal move paladins do is like, the most UNgraceful frustrating thing ever. That should be limited to holy pallys. Like, that should be a 40 pt talent.<br />
4 - Deathgrip, Strangulate, Frosty interrupt thing. Pick ONE[1] of these for each spec. Having all three means every dk ever will kill me. Any two DKs will kill any 3-5 non-dks it seems in BGs.<br />
5 - Why in hell does a melee class need a melee pet? Like, warlocks and hunters make total sense. In addition to this gripe, i think elemental shamans should get the summoned wolves. Anyone who played wc3 remembers that thrall is basically an elemental shaman with 3 skills, Lightning bolt, chain lightening and feral spirit. Idk i dont play a shaman, but that would piss me off if i did.<br />
<br />
So yeah, nerf dks. Nerf them in a way that makes druid their primary threat. heres some thoughts:<br />
- Make the pet classified as a beast capable of hibernating, with no trick to wake him up<br />
- Barkskin makes you immune to diseases/poisons<br />
- Cheetah and cat are immune to the slowing aoe effect thing<br />
- all DK's diseases are now poisons -OR- give druids &quot;Abolish Disease&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, it sucks that a mediocre DK can pwn a pro druid. I know there is no means of proving noobness, but DKs have several direct counters to druids. Hunters [explosive/poison/heal reducing shots], Shaman [purge], Mage [spellsteal], and Lockes [fear/dot] all have their druid killing moves that ive experienced over and over. None of them come CLOSE to being a guarenteed death like the DK. Cant use hots, cant dispell disease, cant risk getting interrupted, cant run away, and then theres the silence. <br />

A stun/interrupt to remain would be fine with an MS thrown in there imo but right now it's just oh cast? deathgrip oh another cast? mmm mindfreeze ohhhh man ya wanna try again?

Its just funny m8. Every blue that comes, rogues go like: again no rogue changes -.-<br />

They are fine, and we even got stats to proof it. RMP is still fots (flavor of the season). Any good rmp can beat a good pala/dk/hunt setup. Happends to me loads of times by our rank 1 rmp. CCing a Pala is childsplay.</div></div><hr />

The #2 2v2 team in my BG is the classic arms warrior/resto druid team. Id be willing to bet people who don't check their facts would say that's impossible.

<br />
I'm four (or five) pages in now on the posting. Which means my entire point will be considered moot due to laziness on the reading side. Folks will read a few posts and respond to the initial few posts. Either way, I think it's important to realize the use of these tournaments.<br />
<br />
Players in these tournaments are looking to win. It's like chess to them -- all strategy. I doubt anyone on the tournament is playing a specific class or race because 'they enjoy it.' They play for class counters and racial abilities. They want to win.<br />
<br />
That being said, the transition between class representation by-week says a lot more about counters than it does about true class representation, druids and warriors barred from that. I think both of those classes need reviewing, but beyond that the only useful information that can be received through fluctuation in class representation can be summed up as: the counter category. Not true class representation. No overpowerness of specific classes.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The ability to punctuate in any specific language, in my biased assessment, does not detract from the ability to play a video game well. I watched a video of an individual hitting 2500 in three versus three arena-based combat with a randomized macro for talents/abilities of the deathknight.

<br />
Stupid, Stupid, Stupid, Silly, Skillless, Lol, Lol, Rogues!! Learn to play without insane CC + dmg. Looks like some of you tried and were succesfull.<br />
Same with Priests and Warlocks, biggest QQ community. Rogue: &quot;Amaged 4 seasons we were able to faceroll and now we have to try!&quot; /target self /golfclap.<br />
<br />
Druids and Warriors are shit and need buffs, other then that seems pretty balanced to me. L2stop cry and start play! :-X<br />
You're so full of it Mute. I've read most of your comments in this thread and all I hear is crap. I also noticed you like to talk a lot about the rogue class. They are not fine. They screwed up the talent trees when WotLK came out and now there is no survivability whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Another thing, in an arena tournament, teams would expect to you play with cookie cutter comps. This is $$$ we're talking about. They have to play new setups in order to counter this. Simple as that. In my opinion, arena tournament shouldn't be a valid reason to say x class needs buffs and y class is OP. Check this out from SK-Gaming. I see rogue twice...in 3v3 as RMP / Shaman Rogue and Warlock (5.6% representation). And guess what? They're not even the FOTM. 3rd and 5th down the list. I'm sorry, but I just got tired of your non sense. <br />

And these are teams over 2000 rating. It might be easy to reach 2000 with one class, but not every class.<br />

Just that, druids. &quot;Druids were OP, druids are blablabla&quot;.. Lissen, there are like 3 sub-classes to druid, they differ from each other as much as your rogue from your paladin. And i've NEVER f'n EVER seen feral and balance doing remotely well in arena. Feral got the burst in WOTLK and has finally started to be somewhat viable, but, LOL, it gets some severe NERFS in 3.1.. GG Blizz.. You nerf the MOST underpresented spec of the most underpresented class.. Where is the f'n logic in that? &gt;.&lt; <br />
<br />
And let me guess.. Those 2 druids in charts are all resto.. And that's even before all the retarded feral nerfs in 3.1..</div></div><hr />

They really represent the average class distribution in this tournament. Yup. I especially like to make judgments about balance and the state of 6 or 7 entire classes based on this top TEN data.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can agree and disagree here. I do think we need a closer look at the top tiers of this tournament and not just the top 10. If there are 1000 teams, then maybe a look at the top 100 or 200 for class distribution. This would give a truer sense of the what is working and what is not.<br />
<br />
However, if we see all the top 1000, it will show us also people in that 1000 who utterly failed in the distribution, and as thus will not show a true look at what classes are working and what are not. Meaning a team could join the tournament but because they sucked and got beat, they'd be added to the distribution table, but without knowing this it would skew an OP class distribution table.<br />
<br />
Also add, that sure showing a class as whole is also misleading. We need to break thing down a bit farther, and begin to look at specs for classes as well.</div></div><hr />

Only 1000 did not play, this is the POST qualifying round. They already weeded out all the failures by moving only the top 1000 on to the next round.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Your sarcasm got lost in terrible grammar and text-based conveying.<br />
<br />
Actually I did catch the sarcasm but the grammar was so terrible I couldn't tell if you meant hunters are strong or weak. However, given the fact that everybody thinks their class sucks I was assuming you said strong, thus meaning weak. Sorry for misunderstanding you, and good luck with your Engrish in the future.</div></div><hr />

therein lies my main point. Let's just not see the top 10 of the qualifiers from that 1000, or whatever the hell number, but everyone that did qualify. I'd guess it's more than 10. Let's see them all. It would give us a better picture of what's working and what's not.</div></div><hr />

Edit: edited my 1st post since it seemed unclear i was thinking as a Rogue 8)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh no dont get me wrong, I never QQd about rogue being underpowered. After all I dont pvp. All I wanna see is some assas love in pve other than buffing hfb (which is boring) over and over again. Well this is sorta outa topic but just saying I never QQd about rogues being underpowered in pvp. But we aint op either in s5. We are right where we need to be and blizz has stated that b4.</div></div><hr />

I've read most of your comments in this thread and all I hear is crap. I also noticed you like to talk a lot about the rogue class. They are not fine. They screwed up the talent trees when WotLK came out and now there is no survivability whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Another thing, in an arena tournament, teams would expect to you play with cookie cutter comps. This is $$$ we're talking about. They have to play new setups in order to counter this. Simple as that. In my opinion, arena tournament shouldn't be a valid reason to say x class needs buffs and y class is OP. Check this out from SK-Gaming. I see rogue twice...in 3v3 as RMP / Shaman Rogue and Warlock (5.6% representation). And guess what? They're not even the FOTM. 3rd and 5th down the list. I'm sorry, but I just got tired of your non sense. <br />
<br />
And these are teams over 2000 rating. It might be easy to reach 2000 with one class, but not every class.<br />

<br />
<br />
So your basically saying classes shouldnt be balanced around representation from the good, if not best players that make it into the top of the arena tournament because they understand and master every aspect of their class? Oke, lets balance classes around qqing rogues and locks then like urself. Or maybe your just to bad, and thought u were good in previous seasons.<br />
<br />
I cant help having a hatred against the Rogue class, they counter ever Hunter ability ingame and then qq about Hunter OPnes and the lack of their own survivability. Play a Hunter once, and then come back to be about that subject. In 1v1, sure their lack of skill wont win the fight when im down at 8k of my hp and their countless ccs are fading, but Rogues often are lowlife backstabbers anyway, hidden in stealth waiting to get that last 2k hp of a player that just won a fight against someone, only for a hk. Play bgs and you know what im talking about.<br />
<br />
That being said, Rogues are fine in PVP, if not even a bit OP atm. <br />
Blind should be 6 seconds, and with that all breakable cc's should be 6 sec.<br />
Disarm should be 5 seconds without having to waste talents or an enchant to get the reduce.<br />
Hunters mark shouldnt be removed so easily by the Rogue himself.<br />
Trap dismantle range should be 5 yards, and should have a chance to fail making the trap able to proc.<br />
Flare should actually work, so a Hunter cant get sapped while standing right in the middle of it.<br />
Track Hidden should work on Rogues when they come withing 5 yards of the Hunter.<br />
Hunter pets should be able to see a rogue when hes on defensive stance, making the Rogue think twice before engaging combat with a Hunter. Wich they so eagerly do, because Hunters cant counter them for a big portion of the time.<br />
Besides that, all CC abilities should stack diminishing returns on eachother. Then you would actually have to think before spamming ur cc's, and maybe use some tactics on how to cc a person the best way.<br />
<br />
Then Rogues would be fine. I dont mind them getting buffs that work vs DK's or other classes they are teribad against. But every class change they have gotten since wotlk seems to be aimed to screw Hunters. At least i know how to write a proper qq post instead of just saying &quot;Rogues are not fine.&quot; Why are they not fine!? Or wait, u cant think of anything other then, Rogues do counter every Hunter ability.. maybe i should l2play. Blizzard agrees.</div></div><hr />

At the moment we are tied for last place with warriors in most arena rankings, and warriors are getting HUGE buffs for 3.1. Outside of a singular 3v3 comp in RMP (which can't crack top 10 on American tournament realms), rogue doesn't have a single top comp in any bracket. Is your message &quot;unless you can't find a top mage + priest, don't play arena as a rogue?&quot; It sure feels like it, because in all other comps, you can replace the rogue with another class and achieve superior results.<br />
<br />
Rogues have the worst mobility, survivability and damage of any true melee classes in PVP. Other classes are seeing big PVP changes for 3.1, we need help before it is too late! So far all you have given us, is more PVE damage. I have watched patch after patch after patch gone by on the PTR, today's patch had changes for 9 out of 10 classes, guess which class was left out?<br />
<br />
Lower Mobility Than Plate:<br />
<br />
Warriors have 15 second intercepts plus snare/root removal + instant intercept CD refresh on a 45 second cooldown. Feral druid's have unlimited snare/root removals, plus 15 second CD feral charges. Rogues have . . . two sprints (useless against snares), two vanishes (often need to be saved for survivability/offense), or a 30 second CD shadowstep (which forces you to sacrifice a ton of damage) that can't even be used in root. Why is a light armor melee class less mobile than a heavy armor melee class? There is no easier class to kite than rogue, even death knights have 20 second CD death grip's, and paladins have 20 second CD blessing of freedoms.<br />
<br />
Lower Survivability Than Cloth:<br />
<br />
Rogue is the only class that can't survive a single stun. Kidney shot, hammer of justice, intercept, you name it, you can play the entire game perfectly, and a single intercept can bring you from 100-0 that is with almost 800 resilience and 3/3 deadened nerve on my rogue. Against any team with a rogue, the strategy is train the rogue, because good things will happen when you do it (like a out of mana/CD healer, or more often than not, a dead rogue).<br />
<br />
Dodge is supposed to be our saving grace, yet even evasion itself is useless against the WOTLK melee classes, death knight and retribution paladin both have a ton of damage that ignore our evasion. You gave warriors 1234567 more ways to activate their overpower. And unless you want rogues to outmuscle plate armor, most of the time we are chasing a cloth/mail while a heavy plate like DK is hammering us from behind all game long, ignoring our dodge completely.<br />
<br />
Lower Damage Than . . . Every DPS Class<br />
<br />
Let's see, if I don't wear heavy resilience, I go down in 2-3 hits. If I do wear heavy resilience, every DPS class in full PVP gear does more damage than me. Blood / Shadowfrost DK? It is more like &quot;do they outdamage me by 50% or 100%&quot;?. Fury warriors? They actually kill healers if left to go 1v1 with them, we don't. Hunter/warlock/mage? Full damage from range that can't be stopped at all, vs a class that has to run for his life (or kited all game long)? Did I mention we are easier to CC than any other melee class? Warrior/DK/Feral Druid all have fear immunes. We have absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
No Unique Utility<br />
<br />
Healing debuff and snare? Warrior/hunter's don't go down in a single global (or in the case of shaman/druid, it doesn't even cost them a full global). Stuns? What class doesn't have stun duration reduction, or stun damage reduction, or ability to break stuns on demand? That would be . . . rogues! And you took our signature ability, the kidney shot, which cost us a huge chunk of burst damage to use, and made it share DR with all other stuns. Oh yes, you gave paladins, the most popular healer in the game the ability to remove stuns on demand for anyone on his team. Expose armor? Used to be good against cloth/leather/mail, now you made it worthless against EVERY CLASS. With warriors getting an ability to remove invulnerability, where is our niche? Even retribution paladin's hammer of justice is a superior stun to kidney shot.<br />
<br />
Suggested Changes:<br />
<br />
1) Delete Sleight of Hand from subtlety (who the hell came up with this talent? Did they really think subtlety rogues needed improved feint?), replace it with nerves of steel, which clearly doesn't belong in a PVE tree. This is our anti-stun talent, it makes us in-line with all other classes. Move enveloping shadows to where nerves of steel is, it is a PVE talent that should be in a PVE tree.<br />
<br />
2) Delete Filthy Tricks, and give us improved shadowstep which lowers the CD by 5/10 seconds, preferably reduce the energy cost by 50/100% as well.<br />
<br />
3) Swap deadly brew and improved poisons, and buff improved poisons for PVE rogues. Every rogue PVP spec deserves deadly brew, it is our only defense when our poisons are gone in one global or less against any class. Make the cripple poison proc from deadly brew instant. <br />
<br />
These are just a few suggestions... I can go on if you'd like?<br />

Your comparing Rogues as worse melee class with Warriors or DK's and Ret palas. As i said, dont mind them getting buffed vs DKs and other melees. 2v2 in my opinion is not PVP. Arguable ofc, but its grossly imbalanced atm. I do play it, although not actively because its not worth the frustration.<br />
<br />
About Rogues not being able to survive a single stun, well thats just bad play tbh. As im talking 3v3 here, i TNT stun, root, cc shot, disengage, rocket boots Rogues while CCing a mage while my DK tries to gimp the priest, he always always manage to get on me somehow combined with the help is a descent skilled mage. Although its dependant on the Arena map.<br />
And yes the single TOP comp in 3v3 is RMP. If you dont like playing that, im sorry but the combo just works and has been working for 5 seasons. I would not teamup with a resto druid and an enh shamman either.<br />
<br />
Very often Rogues are able to sap and start the fight whenever he wants, giving the rmp combo a advantage over all other combos. A bad RMP will go for the Hunter and wins, a good RMP will often go for the DK and spam chains of CC on the pala wich is really easy, i do it all the time in 3v3 and i only have 2 ccs on a long cooldown.<br />
<br />
With dodge supposed to be your saving grace, a Hunter will miss 90% of the dmg he does. Yes paladins and dks dps will just ignore that ability, thats poor gamedesign.<br />
But its nothing to qq about when u take a hard look at deterrence 100% chance to parry and 100% chance to spell deflect on a 5 min CD and a mesily 5 second duration.<br />
Unable to do anything while under its affect, only works from dmg comming from the front, and require a melee weapon to activate. Also dots, paladin seals, dk curses, hunter dmg go straight through it. I often refer to it as the suicide ability, and it only comes in handy against RMP where its more like a 5 sec delay to my death.<br />
<br />
I agree with you that cloth these days has a WAY to big survivabilty. As a mail class i can die within 4 seconds while a mage for example has 4k dmg absorbing shields, 2x iceblock to reset the fact they are bad, get topped up, and try again. Mail these days = lolarmor vs cloth and leather, since those classes have ways to survive while a Hunter has not.<br />
<br />
Rogue dmg is lower then any other class in pvp. Arguable, wear PVE gear maybe like the DKs and Warriors that are hammering on you. A flaw from Blizzards side tbh. Chances are you die faster, but 2v2 is not PVP its fotm based. Your main thing in Arena is your utility, wich has some of the best ingame.<br />
<br />
Kiting is actually pretty damn hard in those small arena maps where you can just rocket boot, 2x sprint, evasion, vanish, blabla to someone, while a mage spams frost novas, his mirror images randomly sheep someone (lol) and iceblock me to stop me from trying to run for my fragile life. Los is an issue for most ranged classes, so your healer should make use of that.<br />
<br />
Stuns. What class doesnt have a stun removal? Hunters! After trinket its all shitlol for them, masters call ur slowing poison, and qq hes helpless vs anything unless being spammed freedom and disengage. But gues what, a running Hunter cant do the same amount of DMG as when he would stand still. Thats why Melees have the advantage as well. Yes Disengage is nice, i really love it. To bad it can screw a Hunter as well when disengaging on Blades edge bridge or dalaran sewers where theres a big chance of failure due to the los issues those badly designed maps have. Often i find myself running like some retard around the map while the DK uses his imbalanced ass to nuke someone before i drop dead. This doesnt feel very Hunter like to me tbh. Yes rets, warriors, and dks are a better melee class.. what you want me to say? At least i dont have to run from them to avoid being completly stunlocked to death. Somehow their dps feels way lower to me then rogue/mage, and im most of the time free as a bird to gimp one down.<br />
<br />
Face 2x DK with a Holy Pala i survive because i can respond to their attacks. VS RMP completly locking down 1 person when ccing the other = 3vs1 in the 1st 10 seconds, wich is often enough all that it takes for them to win. Make a mistake, blow your cooldowns without gimping someone = lose. But that same fact goes for DK/Hunt/Pala cause they only rely on burst and just a little on the CC.<br />

<br />
So you measure skill with the difficulty a class is played? Read my Blizz quote signature again. Your argument would fit better when comparing Rogues harder to master then the 4 button Ret paladins or DKs.<br />
<br />
Counting the 21 keybinding on 1234, q,e,r,t,f,z,x,c,v, ctrl 1234, ctrl e,r,t,f, and the 7 on my middle mouse click, ctrl middle mouseclick, shift middle mouseclick, ctrl + middle mouse scroll up, ctrl + middle mouse scroll down, schift + middle mouse scroll up, shift + middle mousescroll down, and the 15+ macros that are trying to combine the countless abilities the Hunter class has into a single keybind, i would stongly reconsider ur statement. And yes i do use all 28 keybindings every arena match.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just find the argument Hunter is easier to master then Rogue bullshit statement. It takes skill with every class to get high ratings, theres tons of average and bad players, even bad DK's how odd that may seem to you. 90% of the ppl wont even make it in the top 10% of arena, let alone the top 0.5%. No class can roll his face over the keyboard to achieve that rly.</div></div><hr />

WoW pvp is not about player skill, its about maximizing your luck factor. Seriously though the problem with wow pvp has nothing to do with mechanics but rather the demographic of the players. Most people who are &quot;skilled&quot; gamers dont play MMOs and if they do, they left wow a long time ago.<br />
<br />
P.S. I played a 2k+ hunter over 2 seasons and it wasnt even my main, I used 7 keybindings.</div></div><hr />

Well thats either because your bad, or played a BM hunter.<br />
<br />
1. BW,Rapid, killcommand macro<br />
2. Aimedshot<br />
3. Arcane shot<br />
4. Steady shot<br />
5. Intimidation<br />
6. Traps<br />
7. Viper sting<br />
<br />
So you didnt use Concussive shot, Multi-shot, Serpent Sting, Wing Clip, Feign Dead, Flare, Hunters mark, Pet commands, or managed to play a proper MM or Surv spec, especially since they raised the lvl cap to 80 and added + 5 new abilities. Aka your bad, or just a clicker. I boosted one of those to 2.3k in S3 as well. Luck is a factor in every game you play. PVP does take a fair amount of skill, good clickers will always be bad.</div></div><hr />

Mute is not playing a Hunter at all. He's just trolling. He claims to play a Hunter because he knows that doing so will cause nerdrage to some of you. Imho, he prolly plays a Lock or Shaman, and spends his days whining at the forums about &quot;poor Poor Shamans&quot; and &quot;Poor Poor Warlocks&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh and, please remove Arena from the game altogether. That way, we will be saved of players such as Mute. You know, the 12 year olds that spell &quot;you are&quot; as &quot;your&quot; and so on.</div></div><hr />

Second off it sounds like everything you're saying(as usual) comes from a 1v1 perspective, if you can't toy with a rogue with a paladin backing you up then somethings terribly, terribly wrong. You have all the utilities you could ever want combined with them to make the fight go LAWLLLLL CHASE ME ROGUE CHASE ME! while you jump up and down around the trap, the ideas for flare are dumb as hell as is the disarm trap. You make it 5 yards you make it pointless vs the only class it has a use for, your flare is rediculously overpowered, always has been a retarded utility in the game, we might get a sap on one of you but the flare takes us out after and here's the real complicated part of this. Trap then, proc it, disengage, lawlfaceroll. It really, really isnt hard or maybe your BGs full of pro rogues that can use some super awesome skill to not get slowed by the massive aoe frost trap that I never learned about. And please god don't say &quot;just shadowstep out of the frost trap&quot; that spec is terrible unless your team is unbelievabely coordinated in burst. Not really our fault for hunters playing like idiots and blowing the trap every time the CD comes up and capitalizing on it to get the opening advantage.<br />
<br />
To summarize, your ideas are dumb and would make you even more gods vs a class you already have a joke time with in any non 1v1 situation. Then again I have a natural hatred for ranged classes with severe advantages designed around countering melee(HUNTERS) that mash two buttons in consecutive motion and drop me. Don't say hunter pvp is complicated, because we all know it isn't. Flare, Hunters Mark(rofl), Sting, Explosive, Aimed, Concuss, Scatter, Trap, Wingclip, Disengage, Wyvern wooooo 11 whole keybindings, all of which have fairly decent cooldowns so it's completely manageable! and don't include pet commands or aspect switches in that list as that's beyond basic. WoW pvp has always involved very little skill and more reliance on basic knowledge of what you're up against, of your own class, and playing the correct cookie cutter comps, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

It's obvious that MuTe will never give up on any debate. RMP is not fotm and I already gave her the statistics from 3v3 from SK-Gaming. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your comparing Rogues as worse melee class with Warriors or DK's and Ret palas. As i said, dont mind them getting buffed vs DKs and other melees. 2v2 in my opinion is not PVP.&quot; Of course, who else am I going to compare them to??? And why do you keep bringing up 2v2? I said nothing about 2v2 in my argument. <br />
<br />
&quot;And yes the single TOP comp in 3v3 is RMP. If you dont like playing that, im sorry but the combo just works and has been working for 5 seasons.&quot; How can it be the &quot;TOP&quot; comp when it's 3rd on the list? Look at the statistics again. You keep denying yourself. I never said that it didn't work. I'm saying that it's not the TOP comp.<br />
<br />
&quot;With dodge supposed to be your saving grace, a Hunter will miss 90% of the dmg he does.&quot; A little overboard, maybe? I don't get it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your main thing in Arena is your utility, wich has some of the best ingame.&quot; Yeah, maybe in TBC. As I stated in my previous post, almost as if you never read it. UTILITY: Healing debuff and snare? Warrior/hunter's don't go down in a single global (or in the case of shaman/druid, it doesn't even cost them a full global). Stuns? What class doesn't have stun duration reduction, or stun damage reduction, or ability to break stuns on demand? That would be . . . rogues! And you took our signature ability, the kidney shot, which cost us a huge chunk of burst damage to use, and made it share DR with all other stuns. Oh yes, you gave paladins, the most popular healer in the game the ability to remove stuns on demand for anyone on his team. Expose armor? Used to be good against cloth/leather/mail, now you made it worthless against EVERY CLASS. With warriors getting an ability to remove invulnerability, where is our niche? Even retribution paladin's hammer of justice is a superior stun to kidney shot.<br />

Season 1-2 barely count since it was all new and people were most fooling around, it was in S3 when people started focusing on ratings and arena points.<br />
<br />
Clearly pvp is about exploiting any advantage your character has over another, very rarely can a pro enhancement shaman beat a pro Death Knight(ofc it happens once in a while but on average)<br />
<br />
Did the rogues and warriors lose skill from season 3/4 to season 5? no they didnt lose their skill or their reflexes slowed down, their ability to exploit another character was either removed or countered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually they pretty much dominated in s3 and s4 because almost everyone started having all slots with PvP/Resilience pieces. This allowed their hots to dominate :) Druids will be back to being decent sometime soon.<br />
<br />
At least for now I play my druid alt with the Feral/Resto spec to survive all the melee burst and it's not too bad. Kinda fun being able to use all the CC again before the moved the charge down the tree.</div></div><hr />

Every class is in the game is slowing turning into a universal class. Almost every class since WOTL has either a stun, hot, dot, cc, or a decent direct heal, and most importantly, burst damage. its the main reason why ele shammies arnt so hot anymore. They were amazing for 5s mainly because they could do like 5k damage in 2 global cooldowns, (enough to drop someone if they were low) Now everyone can do a shit load of damage in 2 global cooldowns. Personally, this is why I think the pvp side of wow is getting ruined. There is no more uniqueness to the game. Almost every class i can think of has a proc stun or some sort of stun that can buy them enough time to LOS the dps and heal up or get out combat, pretty much just LOS the dps so you dont die. Every healer nowadays can pretty much just run and keep themselves up the entire time. (2v2 basis, possibly in 3s too) Before, only druids could. Pallies had to keep moving around LOS any CS's or cc's and than cast a heal, run around to the other side of LOS, cast a heal etc. It made being a pally so fun and entertaining. This game is all about timing, good reaction time, communicating, not being dumb, and RNG events. I dont understand why anyone says pvp requires &quot;skill&quot; I personally dont think neither of the things I mentioned should be considered a &quot;skill&quot; RNG, you cant do anything about. The main issue of this game is its completely RNG. Crits are RNG, your cc reseting is RNG, your stun resisting, your conterspell resisting is RNG, your massive crit heal that just saved the day is RNG, a resist on a snare is RNG, and anything else you can think of is RNG. You can't stack and stats or where any pieces of gear to prevent this because it will still happen regardless of whatever your doing. This game requires no skill at all. And no, this isnt coming from a scrub player. I've been glad for 4 seasons as a pally and including merc glad in 3s on Rampage BG. <br />
<br />
To the people who want to play a competitive game will actual skill is envolved, play Counter Strike. Good money to be made and requires a very high level of skill to be the top players in the world. hand eye coordination, able to make good strategies, etc</div></div><hr />

You can very well do alot about your RNGs. Get more % on what u need to become a better player. If you have 35% crit ull crit 1 our of 3. Only thing random about it is Wich of the 3 is a crit, and wich 2 are not. Stacking more % = more chance to be succesfull. Its hardly that random as you claim it to be, and in long term its even very consistent. But bad player will be bad.</div></div><hr />

Nice way of sending out a clear message:<br />
<br />
- Roll class A or class B to insta-win<br />
- If you play class C/D/E/F/G/H, make sure you pair up with classes A/B to win<br />
- Don't bother with class X or class Y at all<br />
<br />
<br />
You are speaking the truth!<br />
<br />
Just as an example: Let's say A is a DK. Almost any setup can do well with a DK.<br />
But as class C - Let's take a Rogue, that seems to only do well in RMP. Tho It exist a SLR team.<br />
And then in the end, class X that is an warrior.. You can easly take a DK or Ret pala instead, since they bring better utility (or whatever).. instead of an warrior.<br />
--<br />
<br />
But the fact is, its just way easier with A and B to get a good group then X and Y.. as you said.</div></div><hr />

Guys dont believe on those charts they cant come up with any new topic. Like is said before seeing those chart is like me vesting in Madoff.

<br />
And what game were you playing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Pallys were more than viable in 3s and 5s either as ret or holy throughout TBC. Hell, even ret/rogue and ret/mage tore things up in 2s even though it is a fact that people like you have magically forgotten. Of course, I don't expect people like you to adhere to facts and truths when you've managed to cry so hard on your blog about how gimped the paladin class is that a ignorant reader would think it is the worst class in the game (hint, it's far from it).<br />
<br />
So tell me one time where you have judged the state of your class by looking at the entire game and all of its classes instead of through the narrow lenses of just you and your class. Go ahead, I'll even believe you.<br />
