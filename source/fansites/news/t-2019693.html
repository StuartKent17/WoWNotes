Only problem is having to have a sub. Let mine lapse again because there's nothing for me to do currently. Guess I'll be skipping this one. :&lt;<br />

You need to kill it this week, not just in general. Hence my comment in reply to Socialhealer.<br />

Hmm. Maybe, but the other contests didn't require that as far as I am aware. Could totally be possible though. If so, might actually be worth resubbing with gold.<br />
<br />
Oh wow, either I can't read or that was changed in the last few minutes. Probably my inability to read, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Killing him on multiple characters on 1 account will not get your more entries and trying to enter on multiple accounts will get you disqualified entirely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, for a couple of wowhead ones there have been multiple chances per account. <br />
And i did read the first few words, i also read the part about entering on multiple accounts, i just wanted to make it clear i was not intending to do that</div></div><hr />

You can enter regardless of when you killed archimonde. Its an issue with their b-tag linking system.</div></div><hr />

I logged in my battle net. My name in the top right corner changed correctly to my battle.net tag.<br />
Then it just keeps on saying &quot;Your characters are still updating! Refresh this page in a few minutes.&quot;<br />
It's been like this since morning. I've pressed update over 20 times i think. Still updating...<br />
And yes i've killed archimonde on mythic yesterday. <br />
In the last 3 contests it managed to refresh the characters, but said that i wasnt prepared... even though i was.<br />
<br />
Did you log off your character? Armory doesn't update till you log off so it wont actually show you killed him till then.<br />
<br />
the 3 contests that required and achievement or kill worked fine for me. It's odd that this large of scale people have issues with this.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever sent me your battletag to check?<br />
<br />
edit: I see why, you denied us access to your profile, so there are no characters attached to your account.<br />
<br />
Try disconnecting MMOC here: https://battle.net/account/management/authorizations.html and then logging out and in on the contest site. Be sure you disconnect MMOC, as that page is bugged and will always remove the first item on the list, so you have to keep removing applications until it actually removes the right one.<br />
<br />
After that log back in and don't deny us access to your profile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone is having issues signing up after killing Archi. Log off MMO champion, then go to your browser history and clear all your files. Try logging back in and see if that helps. I've been trying to get signed up for 2 days now after killing Archi on two different characters. Finally tried the clearing history part and thank goodness it worked cause I'm really not sure I could handle another LFR Archi lol. My raid team is on raid break atm so my only way unless I wanted to pug it or go to Hyjal.</div></div><hr />

I had to wait half an hour for it to work but it worked. I was wondering if it had to be linked to my MMO-Champion account but it didn't. I wonder if they have picked any winners yet</div></div><hr />

This week it will be fast like the first one, no hardcore vetting necessary since Battlenet login is handling the log of entries. They just gotta pick 500 people randomly.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure the site was run from Europe in the good old days when Boubouille was still doing the news. But yeah, this will probably be the American timezone to give a fair chance to everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm used to not getting into beta from nearly every previous expansion, but this one feels more frustrating than past ones since so much of each spec is tied to an artifact weapon that won't be available on ptr or on the pre-patch. Harder to get a feel for which class I want to play. Boomkin is usually my main but with the Legion changes Boomkin will now be a builder/spender class and the primary resource builder is tied to the artifact weapon, rendering the class virtually unplayable on the ptr and during pre-patch. It would really be nice to get a feel for how the classes actually play...not just incomplete versions of each class available for public testing.</div></div><hr />
