The Crimson Halls of the Icecrown Citadel unlock this week!  
 
The Blood Princes and Blood Queen Lana'thel will be unlocked. 
You will get 15 attempts to defeat the final boss of each wing (Putricide / Lana'thel). So far we assume that the amount of attempts is shared between bosses. (And I'm sure blue posters will clarify that a hundred of times)

Changes to PPM procs<br />
We changed the way PPM procs work to make sure many of the weapons and trinkets did their expected performance in Icecrown instead of proc'ing too much for some specs or classes or forcing players into unusual behavior to try and fish for the procs. This change also affected some older mechanics in the game too such as the Berserking enchant. For the most part the intent is that these systems all proc off of attacks and they are balanced with that assumption.<br />
<br />
At this time we're happy with the damage that characters are now doing after these changes, though we'll continue to monitor and adjust damage overall and that includes the proc-based items. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418707360-ppm-behavior-nerf.html))<br />

Addons - Bejeweled and Peggle<br />
You probably spent a lot of time waiting for an instance group since the release of Patch 3.3, it's time to mention Bejeweled and Peggle (http://www.popcap.com/promos/wow/) on the front page again!<br />
<br />
About a year ago, Popcap released a free version of their games that you can download and install like any addon, both games run smoothly and will keep you busy while you wait for an instance. Of course, I won't be responsible if you play that DURING the instance. (or if you waste 2 hours on Peggle when you are supposed to write a news post for your front page &lt;coughs&gt;) <br />

Anyone know if this affectes the Nibelong staff in any way?<br />
or is it only old things with internal cooldown ?<br />
<br />
I got Nibelung for my elemental shaman, and has been quite sad to find that is procs verry sedom for me since I have long casting time on my spells and it seemed to be the only proc thing that just had a low ( 1%) proc chance and no internal cooldown.<br />

<br />
Already mentioned that you can attempt Blood Princes w/o touching the other wing, but I'm not sure I agree with thinking they'll be harder than Putricide. CBA to find it, but the blue post said that the final boss of each wing would be a step up, or harder than the bosses before it. This may mean Lana'Thel &gt; Putricide &gt; Blood Princes &gt; Fest/Rot etc.<br />

True, the flow chart doesn't add the weeks in between the frost wing unlocking and the Lich King encounter unlocking. Is it safe to assume there will be a pause? Or can we just head to Arthas right after steamrolling Sindragosa? ;P</div></div><hr />

Yeah, except if they dont block it somehow, people plow through the content in a few weeks then QQ about how they have nothing new to do for however many months until the expansion. If they make the content harder, people cry until it gets nerfed anyway. They cant win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a difficulty setting, really. You'll eventually clear the encounter if you keep at it for a couple weeks, but what it's supposed to distinguish is between raids that learn from their mistakes quickly and adapt and those that don't. It's going to be the same for hard modes too, where the most skilled guilds are going to clear it first because they adapt quicker and don't get locked out--not because they have more time to invest on it. What people need to be on the lookout for, however, is 100% dependency on their attempts system to make an encounter hard. It should go on top of existing difficulty to meter guilds. Otherwise we end up with a disappointment like Algalon all over again.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the idea of what they're trying to do. It's not a bad design because it cockblocks people. From fight mechanics a lot of fights historically cockblocked people for over a month purely by the fight being hard. But it can become a bad design when it becomes the centerpiece and most important aspect of every encounter, where RNG &gt; the raid. (Icehowl + Lag maybe?)<br />
<br />
The bigger issue is that some players are too used to clearing normal modes the night they're released. It happened because the last tier was so easy and because the first wing of ICC set expectations about the rest of the tier. Players seem to feel that they should be exempt from the pains of progression altogether, clear the instance instantly, and get out of there so they can jump around in circles at the south bank in their shiny new epics. But I ask this: If you don't like progression, are you bored of raiding? Because that's been the focus of raiding since the beginning of MMORPGs.</div></div><hr />

Cockblocked? I'm in a very casual 10man raiding guild made up of mostly reallife friends. Yet we downed Professor Putricide on our 5th attempt the night we killed Rotface for the first time.<br />
<br />
I reckon real &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds will down him in 2-3 attempts on their first night. If you however mistake much time to raid for skill, then yes, you might be cockblocked. And actually it would be a good thing.<br />
<br />
Blocked my ass. IMHO Rotface was harder than the Professor.<br />

Dude you have no idea what you're talking about. 10 man content is a joke. pure joke. go try putricide in 25 man and come back here again. Ofc he's a joke in 25man too but the limitation of 10 tries is just a poor way to extend the already poor content. <br />
For the last almost 6 months all we have to raid is ToC. A small, silly raid instance with just 5 easy bosses that drop high quality loot, making ulduar and nax totally useless. So for 6 months we farm toc and then all we get from ICC is 4 ridiculously easy and not challenging bosses for another month (in my guild we kill them in less than 1h and then we do toc again). And after these 4 we get 3 new with the 2 abominations being kinda easy and putricide being just challenging. So for the first challenging boss in months we get just 10 attempts?!?! To prove what? that we're skilled and concentrated ?? The stupidity of this argument becomes even more clear if we consider factors like the TERRIBLE servers that cause HUGE lag spikes and simply cant handle the workload they get (at least the euro servers. i dont have a clue about usa).<br />
<br />
WotLK was very promising at start. Great content while we leveled up, great stories to be told, all classes and specs became fun and viable etc. However the raiding content was disapointing from the 1st day. The main raid for months was nax, an old and already used raid instance that droped old and already used models of armor. Simply disapointing. After that came ulduar which was really nice and enjoyable but then came a poor designed instance like ToC and ruined it. None set foot in ulduar again. Everyone and i mean everyone, my grandmother her dog and her dog's pet got dressed in t9 (which is ridiculous) and all we had to do was to wait for ICC and hope.<br />
<br />
ICC is here and it's a big disapointment so far.Bosses that got puged from the 1st week, armor so bad designed that makes eyes bleed and the only challenging boss has a limitation on the attempts we have on it....<br />
<br />
Poor content is poor.<br />
<br />
Edit : Just thought about comparing the raid content between vanilla-TBC-WotLK in terms of different bosses. Let's see :<br />
<br />
Vanilla : MC-10 + BWL-8 + AQ40-9 + AQ20-6 + ZG-10 + Nax-15 + Onyxia-1 + 5 outdoor (3 emeralds - kazzak -azuregos) = 64 different bosses<br />
<br />
TBC : Karazhan-12 + Gruul's lair-2 + Magtheridon-1 + ZA-6 + TK-4 + SSC-6 + Hyjal-5 + BT-9 + Sunwell-6 + 2 outdoor (doomwalker - kazzak) = 53 different bosses <br />
<br />
WotLK : Nax (no new bosses here),Onyxia (nothing new either), VoA-3 + OS-1 + eye of eternity-1 + Ulduar-14 + ToC-5 + ICC-12 = 36 different bosses<br />
<br />
<br />
Concerning armors in Vanilla we got 3 different tiers, in TBC 3 different tiers and in WoTLK 2 and a half since t9 wasnt designed for each class seperately which means less variety for us and less work for the developers.<br />
<br />
Conclusion : In wotlk we got great improvements for all classes and specs, the game interface evolved and with tools like the dungeon finder, the dual spec etc it became a joy to see and play. However, despite having all those great improvements and tools at our disposal, we have nothing to use them on. Content is significantly less than before and much easier. The word &quot;challenge&quot; has been eliminated from WoW's vocabulary. Lets's hope that Cataclysm will be better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your guess is poor just like your reading skills probably. my guild has killed putricide and my objection is that 10 attempts for a challenging 25man boss are too few especially when you have to deal with blizzard's poor servers.</div></div><hr />

Unless you overgear the encounter its very very difficult, it is insanely tuned.<br />

lol we killed the 7 bosses on 10men in less then 2 hours the week after its release, and it took us only 2-3 wipes on the professor. I don't know what you mean by overgeared but if every person in the raid knows its class and knows the tactics for every boss, then you will see you are not right.

Yes, because bosses like Golemagg and Sulfuron were totally well-designed, engaging boss fights that Blizzard clearly put a lot of thought into.<br />
<br />
EDIT: RE: t9, you'll disparage Blizzard for sharing armor designs across similar classes, but ignore different armor designs for the factions, as well as ignoring the fact that weapon designs are way, way ahead of anything they've produced in the past?

&quot;10 man is a joke herpaderp. Go try 25 Putricide. I mean, it's a joke too, but 10 attempts suck and the content sucks&quot;<br />
<br />
I find it pretty funny that your point is to whine about their poor tactics creating and extending content, and you didn't make any mention of the tiered wings and hardmodes being delayed release (at least there, where you cried about it), and instead whined about &quot;joke encounters I'm too terrible to down&quot;. Hah.<br />
<br />
To summarize your post:<br />
&quot;Hey guys, I've hated the content from Naxx till now. This game sucks. Blizzard sucks. But since my life contains nothing of substance, let me whine about (on a non official board, ie: giving no criticism or suggestion, just crying) how much it personally offends me that this video game I voluntarily play, pay for, and support Blizzard with everytime I hit Accept, sucks so much. And after watching Blizzard systematically nerf the game for casuals for the last 3 years, I'm hoping Cataclysm will change that!&quot;<br />

In conclusion, you're a thick headed twit that needs to control his addiction to a video game. Get over the fact that this game was intended to be designed for, and is continued to be designed for the average player. The fact that you can't kill this &quot;joke boss&quot; in less than 10 attempts (you've had 20 now total, 10(15?) more tonight), just goes to show you are one of those average players anyway. Stop your crying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;10 man is a joke herpaderp. Go try 25 Putricide. I mean, it's a joke too, but 10 attempts suck and the content sucks&quot;<br />
<br />
I find it pretty funny that your point is to whine about their poor tactics creating and extending content, and you didn't make any mention of the tiered wings and hardmodes being delayed release (at least there, where you cried about it), and instead whined about &quot;joke encounters I'm too terrible to down&quot;. Hah.<br />
<br />
To summarize your post:<br />
&quot;Hey guys, I've hated the content from Naxx till now. This game sucks. Blizzard sucks. But since my life contains nothing of substance, let me whine about (on a non official board, ie: giving no criticism or suggestion, just crying) how much it personally offends me that this video game I voluntarily play, pay for, and support Blizzard with everytime I hit Accept, sucks so much. And after watching Blizzard systematically nerf the game for casuals for the last 3 years, I'm hoping Cataclysm will change that!&quot;<br />

Ok let me summarize your post<br />
<br />
&quot; Hey guys, i'm a troll who cant read other people's posts and says things that are illogical and contradict the common sense. Also i never complain about anything even if it needs improvement&quot;<br />
<br />
In conclusion your a retarded nub that has iq lower than a chicken and your absolute enjoyment in your pathetic little life is to try to insult people through the internet. Gratz you're one of those awesome players that are full t9 etc. Go on with your trolling you've earned it after all</div></div><hr />

Just cleared out the 7 available bosses (entrance and unholy wing), and Crimson Halls isn't available. Saurfang is still saying that it opens 13 days after the first.

He actually summarized your post perfectly!<br />
And you're just making youself look even more bad by keep sprewing out your shit here.<br />
You allready lost this discussion when you posted your QQ about how sucky this game is, and how they need to improve it. If you are serious about your crap, then go to the official forums, and post it there.<br />
Also, if you think the game is so crappy, then quit playing, no one is forcing you to play it... it's just a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So in your opinion there is nothing wrong with the current wow content and you're totally satisfied by doing the same old instances again and again for months.<br />
You also think that writing about this specific problem (lack of raiding content) means i believe that the whole game sucks.<br />
On top of that you try to tell me what to do, where to post my comments and you close with a laughable comment like &quot;Also, if you think the game is so crappy, then quit playing, no one is forcing you to play it&quot;. <br />
Plz answer this question : Are you for real? Do you ever use your brain before saying - writing something? <br />
Ofc it's my mistake that i bother to answer to someone like you who cant even grasp the meaning of words like forum, discussion, opinion etc. so i'll stop it. It's as pointless as trying to make a conversation with a brick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, can anyone else point me to a game and/or development team that provides the kind of content and updates in a video game that people like Nienor are looking for?</div></div><hr />

I doub't many have seen the old one @ 60. We've gotten alot of new people in WoW.<br />
And gz u can clear the 7 bosses in a hour or 2. We haven't killed Putricide yet. I do not find him a joke. Sux to be me? No. Tailored to my kind of playing, and for most of the wow people.</div></div><hr />

more like 99% of the playerbase hasn't seen 60 naxx. IMO, It was new content.</div></div><hr />
