Ghostcrawler is back and gives a few more details on what's going to happen in 3.1 for some classes. I wouldn't be surprised to see the patch hit the PTRs this week, stay tuned? <br />
Patch 3.1 Information Compilation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=38462.0)<br />
Making decisions while healing<br />
My point was more that when it all comes down to it, healing is generally limited by one of three things: 1) Running out of mana, 2) Running out of GCDs, and 3) Just doing the wrong thing in the wrong situation.<br />
<br />
The type 3 fights are generally the most interesting for a healer, but you're also not going to find every fight like that, and it might be exhausting if they were. I am generally referring to fights where you shouldn't heal at a certain time, or you need to move at a certain time, or you need to heal the right person at exactly the right time.<br />
<br />
Currently we think the game has strayed too far towards the type 2 style of healing, where if you miss a single global, your target might die. This may not be the case if you are on Naxxramas milk runs, but it was certainly the case in Sunwell and other more challenging content. Since you must heal for your max amount every GCD, and the penalty for failing that heal (i.e. wiping) is probably worse than the penalty for overhealing, the healing game feels very spammy. More situational or efficient heals lose out compared to heals that maximize throughput. Coordination among healers doesn't feel particularly necessary because overhealing isn't a big deal. Paying attention to what is going on in the fight is a luxury because you need to keep those max casts coming.<br />
<br />
However, part of backing out of that means carving enough bandwidth out so that players can make decisions about who to heal and which spell to use. The key word is &quot;decisions.&quot; A rogue makes a decision about when to blow cooldowns or pop a Healthstone. A warrior tank makes a decision about when to blow Last Stand or sometimes even Taunt. If all a priest is doing is using CoH and PoM on every cooldown and filling in the space with Flash Heal, or if all a paladin is doing is spamming HL and using DP every cooldown, those aren't interesting decisions -- in fact they are the kind of thing that can be macroed and macros are often (though not always) a warning sign that the player isn't or doesn't have to decide which ability to use next.<br />
<br />
There will always be some simple &quot;gear check&quot; style fights. Those have their place, particularly to communicate to your group that perhaps you aren't yet ready. But they don't all have to be that way. <br />
<br />
[...] Here is a great paladin decision: &quot;Should I heal that guy who likely won't die in the next couple of seconds or does that dependable druid have hots on him already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Currently the answer is: &quot;I can afford to waste the mana, so who cares?&quot;<br />
<br />
Note that I am not saying you need to necessarily look at the target's active spells to know the answer. If you heal with the same people for very long, you form a good idea of what they are doing. In pugs you might need more explicit rules for who heals whom, but again, you can currently afford to be so sloppy with your mana that it's not worth the effort.

Dual-Specialization not available to lower level characters in patch 3.1<br />
With new features we have learned that players tend to be much more forgiving if we are too stringent at first and relax requirements over time, than if we give away too much and end up having to &quot;nerf&quot; a feature that turned out to be overly generous. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14990657573-dual-spec-disappointment-healing.html))<br />

Blood Plague and HoT removal<br />
This (the hot removal of Blood Plague) is something we are definitely taking a hard look at for 3.1. Plague Strike is intentionally weak because of this ancillary effect, but that also leads to DKs not wanting to use a core ability except when doing PvP against hot-based healers (which pretty much means druids). DK survivability and utility in PvP are definitely not something we are overly worried about at the moment. [...] I meant that DKs have plenty going for them in PvP even if they could no longer remove a whole stack of Lifebloom.

Why was Mutilate nerfed instead of Overkill/Dirty Deeds/Glyphed Vigor?<br />
An Overkill change would have required more redesign of the talents and abilities than we were willing to make for a small patch like this. We're also unconvinced it would have fixed the problem alone.<br />
<br />
Basically, it might have helped stealth burst, but wouldn't have helped with unstealthed burst, which was still too high in our opinion. Two Mutilates and a Cold Blood Eviscerate within one Kidney Shot duration is a ton of damage, and is possible with unglyphed Vigor and no Overkill. Add a partner or an interrupt or whatever and it can mean death for most players in very few GCDs.<br />
<br />
Overkill and glyphed Vigor are something we will probably look at for 3.1, depending on how the current changes shake out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990477144-why-didnt-you-nerf-overkill.html))<br />
<br />
Dirty Deeds / Mutilate bug<br />
There did seem to be a bug with Dirty Deeds affecting Mutilate damage, and I believe it was hotfixed yesterday (13 Feb). Mutilate should now be doing lower damage vs. poisoned targets in all cases. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990476035-rogue-dirty-deeds-bug-confirmed.html))<br />
<br />
Rogue poison damage / Consequences of changes made to Mutilate<br />
Rogue poison damage had at least two bugs in the system when Lich King launched. When we fixed those bugs, rogue damage dropped significantly. There is speculation that the same thing is true of Dirty Deeds -- that because Dirty Deeds was inflating poison damage more than we realized that rogue damage will drop too much with the Mutilate changes and Dirty Deeds bug fix.<br />
<br />
We do not have that concern at this time. We are happy with Mutilate's extra damage to poisoned targets to be 20% with or without Dirty Deeds. We plan to increase rogue PvE damage in other ways, such as through the announced (but not finalized) Hunger for Blood, Killing Spree and Lightning Reflexes changes in 3.1.<br />
<br />
I suspect the Dirty Deeds bug was introduced at the same time as the Mutilate nerf in 3.09, but can't know for sure without a lot of digging. (I say that because I suspect the Dirty Deeds talent had to recalculate bonus damage and we neglected to change this calculation when we changed Mutilate itself.) I'll report back when and if I have time to investigate or if someone else at Blizzard knows the answer off the top of their head.<br />
<br />
We are skeptical that the Mutilate change and Dirty Deeds hotfix will be the death knell for rogues in PvP, but we will keep an eye on what happens with these changes in place. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990475915-now-that-youve-fixed-the-dirty-deeds-bug.html))<br />

Using Voidwalker to tank raid content (Sartharion)<br />
I would not expect the Voidwalker to continue to be an excellent tank for challenging raid content.<br />
<br />
The health boost was largely for PvP reasons and the damage avoidance was to make up for limitations in pet AI and master control, not to let you opt out of having to manage tons of incoming damage on your main tank.

Tanking and disparities between classes<br />
We still are not convinced that warrior tanks are operating at some huge deficit compared to other tanks. There are going to be situations where one or the other classes are going to feel easier as tanks, just because the abilities and mechanics are still different despite all of our homogenization (and we really don't want to homogenize any more).<br />
<br />
I think there are some quality of life issues we can improve for warriors. Heroic Strike is definitely one of them. It does its job in letting you convert excess rage to threat without consuming a global cooldown, but it requires a lot of extra button pushes. It is something we are discussing.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-02-16, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does Blizzard feel that it is necessary to balance raid content on the back of healers? They want to make it harder for healers to spam and set up macros but that is all that dps does. Tanks do the same but need to be more visually aware. It seems like Blizzard is asking a lot of a role that is already the most uncommon role. Allowing for healers to carry less weight made it easier to get a lot of new people interested in healing. If they go down the road where healers have to constantly be on top of their game then those new healers will simply go back to being dps. After raiding as both a tank and a healer I can honestly say that the only time I have actually enjoyed raiding is as a dps because it didn't feel like I was carrying the weight of 24 other people on my shoulders. The goal for Blizzard should be how do we make healing more fun and easier instead of how do we make healing carry even more weight than it does now.<br />
<br />
Warrior tanks are still lacking in aoe threat. They are above druids in over all aoe threat but they are still way behind paladins and dks. The fact that every group has gotten rid of cc and just wants to aoe everything down now means that warriors need a boost and so do druids. Maul should hit 2 targets with a glyph to hit 3 (not 1 to 2). Warriors need an ability that hits 3 targets at the same time as well (on top of thunderclap and shockwave). If that was done then druids and warriors would be on par with paladins and dks when it came to tanking. Until it is done they are way under where they need to be on threat. That does not mean that some very well played warriors can't hold threat to 3 mobs at once, but they definitely have to work harder to do so then paladins or death knights. <br />
<br />
As a boomkin (we thrive on aoe) that loves to spam hurricane for trash I cringe when I'm grouped with a warrior tank because my over all dps takes a nose dive when I end up tanking one or two mobs. I avoided wasting points on talents that reduced my own aggro because they really should not be needed and are not needed in any boss kill and on most trash packs in raids. When I group with paladins or dks (even undergeared ones) I can go all out and not even once have to worry about getting aggro. That has shown me that there is an issue with warriors when it comes to aoe threat. Blizzard needs to either boost the threat of TC and SW or add a new ability similar to hammer of righteous that allows the warrior to hit 3 mobs at a time (maybe an ability that makes sunder armor hit 3 mobs at a time even).</div></div><hr />

Meh about Plague Strike nonsense, although as 51/0/20 it does feel a little off to run a diseaseless rotation it requires both solid gear to pull off and falls quickly behind in AoE fights. The sad part is most likely they'll end up nerfing the crap out of Obliterate / Heart Strike co-efficients while only mildly buffing the diseases.</div></div><hr />

While I'm all for a little extra challenge, the regen nerf really doesn't help anyone. Way to encourage hybrid classes to heal instead of specing DPS or tank; the message is now just too obvious. If you want to heal, you must be a masochist (or desperate for a raid invite, whichever happens first).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Think of the group not yourself. Paladins don't need shield wall. I very rarely use divine protection. Being &quot;block capped&quot; is huge as compared to other tanks. Our &quot;last stand&quot; is on a 20 minute cool down and gives up back 100% health. In most raid situations, a 20 minute cool down (which can be talented to 16 minutes if you chose to go into holy) is normally enough that it always comes up during the next boss fight.<br />
<br />
Our &quot;charge&quot; (Pursuit of Justice) is 15% speed increase and 50% reduction on disarm affects. It is much more useful then actual charge will ever be. <br />
<br />
We don't need vigilance because we already do more threat (even single target) than a warrior and all vigilance does is redirect the threat of the person doing the most aggro and in cases of aoe aggro its still not enough.<br />
<br />
After 3.1 we will have more interrupts than a rogue. We don't need spell reflect. <br />
<br />
Warriors need help to be on par with paladins not the other way around. Paladins already take the least spiky damage and have the best threat as compared to all other tanking classes. Sure they don't have as many tools for pure avoidance and mitigation but they are balanced so that what they do have is more passive and doesn't require cool downs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Threat is NOT an issue AT ALL for warriors. TBC, yeah we needed CC (minor) and the ability for your group to follow an FF order. To say now that we are lackin threat is just annoying. Sorry tanks you cant pick one target... and just tank that and use TC and SW every time its up and hold a bunch of mobs. Try actually changing your target and rotate SS, REV, CB, HT... ya know.. mix it up a bit maybe?<br />
<br />
I cant wait until Blizzard comes out with some stupid passive ability where the amount you are healed is actually applied to your threat multiplied by the number of tears that fall off of horrible tanks. Maybe then you wont have any problems.<br />

Oh hell, lets just get rid of threat all together... how much easier is Blizzard going to make it for bad tanks to feel they are actually good?</div></div><hr />

Do you think rogue+healer has that much burst ? I think blizzard isn't really getting to that part... people are talking about rogue burst cuz of double dps not single dps... anyway just my thoughts.<br />

Wow, i'm still impressed they haven't talked about some underpowered and disappeared classes on PvP (resto droods and (non-resto) shammies)<br />
<br />
About the dual-spec... i'm starting to have my doubts either on them or how much later will the 3.1 come.<br />
<br />
I don't understand a thing of warrior but still our MT is a warrior and we haven't got any porblem with him yet at all (though i do not know his prespective).<br />
<br />
My wish: Plz take out rogues burst and give buff to mutilate... on raids mutilate sometimes DOES LESS DAMAGE than Instant Poison... it's just stupid... -.-. It means a rogue that just has HfB and SnD up and auto-attacking &quot;almost&quot; has the same damage as one struggling to get his DPS maxxed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
First, if you don't like the pressure of being a tank or a healer, dont role one. I guarantee you that only the people who thrive on this pressure are decent at their roles. If you aren't comfortable with it, its not the role for you. That being said, making these roles simple to the point of being elementary doesn't reward those people who actually ENJOY their crucial roles with a) pleasure at completing a challenging task and b) recognition between themselves (a skilled healer) and the horrible healers they are carrying.<br />
<br />
At the moment, healing is an absolute joke. There used to be a time where a raid was able to tell (very easily) if a healer was amazing or horrible. There used to be a time when people had different strategies to both keep their assignments alive and also manage their mana. People had different downranked spells to prevent overhealing. They could fashion their own rotations to maximize their mana depending on who or what kind of damage they were healing. There was decision making involved. And there were consequences if they failed to make the right decisions. <br />
<br />
Even with the constant spam style heal of content like SWP, good healers were easily identifiable. <br />
<br />
Every quality healer i know is utterly bored with what healing has become, and some have even quit the game till things change. They are loathe to pickup dps classes because comparing that to what healing used to be, its boring and routine.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedalon</div><div class="date">2009-02-16, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is doing it all wrong when it comes to healers atm. They think that reducing their mana regen will make them more aware on what they heal. Its still leaves ppl spaming their heals and running out of mana. And then everyone is unhappy !<br />
<br />
Best way to prevent this is to turn overhealing into extra threat. So if a person is for example spaming to big heal or a group heal when not needed he will get directly punished for it. Person throwing out 5 chainheals doing 5% healing and 95% overhealing should pull agro of any tank. The person doing things wrong will get punished and die - Everyone will see what he did wrong and if he doesn't learn from it in 3-4 deaths he will not be picked again for raids. <br />
<br />
This way its very easy to control the ACTUAL needed heal instead of making it depend entierly on mana. Beeing OOM does not nessiserily punish the person that runs OOM. He might be doing is job 100% correctly while some other nub is throwing out overheals in all directions. THe person running OOM will get punished for not doing his job while a another one that did not do his part gets ignored for his part.</div></div><hr />

Best way to prevent this is to turn overhealing into extra threat. So if a person is for example spaming to big heal or a group heal when not needed he will get directly punished for it. Person throwing out 5 chainheals doing 5% healing and 95% overhealing should pull agro of any tank. The person doing things wrong will get punished and die - Everyone will see what he did wrong and if he doesn't learn from it in 3-4 deaths he will not be picked again for raids. <br />
<br />
This way its very easy to control the ACTUAL needed heal instead of making it depend entierly on mana. Beeing OOM does not nessiserily punish the person that runs OOM. He might be doing is job 100% correctly while some other nub is throwing out overheals in all directions. THe person running OOM will get punished for not doing his job while a another one that did not do his part gets ignored for his part. <br />
<br />
<br />
no one is running out of mana however. I'm not defending the MP5 nerf as a legit way to make healing interesting, dont get me wrong, but at the time, there are a minimal number of encounters that require a constant spam of heals on the order of sunwell - any spam that may happen is more born out of &quot;i have the mana so why not?&quot; attitude. I side with the idea that penalties that at some point distinguish the bad healers from the good ones, but I'm unsure of what form that takes.<br />
<br />
The threat idea is interesting, but i really dont see it happening.</div></div><hr />

Its enough easy as it is for warrior to ae tank now. I find it OP as it is, who says warrs are hardest tanks to handle? those days are over. And people who have trouble with it: do you tank boss in same gear as trash? If you do, then no wonder. Get that ap and block UP and crit like madman. Or reroll paladin and yawn at it.<br />
<br />
Puting pressure on healers and tanks is good! Less slackers, more &quot;on your toes&quot; players around. (image from AQ ae raid healing and maintaining your mana there comes to mind)<br />

But you see sir, overhealing is a very important thing. A lot of people look at overhealing as a waste, however it really is additional healing that could be done, if the damage was there. I imagine if all the healing I did was dealt in damage the raid would constantly die because people don't understand the necessity of prehealing and non canceling idk. I honestly miss the days when mana was an issue. Potting on CD made fights more interesting, nowadways you get enough mana pots running 2 heroics to last you the week.. and thats probably popping a few in PVP.. Although I love to heal, anyone that heals against me gets beat terribly, and I wonder what they are doing exactly, having that x-factor as a healer is a great feeling. <br />
<br />
Anyway.. All in all I feel that your average healers are average because they lack the control and ability to access the knowledge on how to become above the pack.. This is not blizzards fault, terrible people are terrible. Hopefully Ulduar will require much better healers.</div></div><hr />

If you're having trouble aoe tanking as a warrior you need to do something better. I've never had a problem on my warrior tanking aoe packs in both 10 and 25 mans.</div></div><hr />

Paladins don't need shield wall. I very rarely use divine protection. Being &quot;block capped&quot; is huge as compared to other tanks. Our &quot;last stand&quot; is on a 20 minute cool down and gives up back 100% health. In most raid situations, a 20 minute cool down (which can be talented to 16 minutes if you chose to go into holy) is normally enough that it always comes up during the next boss fight.<br />
<br />
Our &quot;charge&quot; (Pursuit of Justice) is 15% speed increase and 50% reduction on disarm affects. It is much more useful then actual charge will ever be. <br />
<br />
We don't need vigilance because we already do more threat (even single target) than a warrior and all vigilance does is redirect the threat of the person doing the most aggro and in cases of aoe aggro its still not enough.<br />
<br />
After 3.1 we will have more interrupts than a rogue. We don't need spell reflect. <br />
<br />
Warriors need help to be on par with paladins not the other way around. Paladins already take the least spiky damage and have the best threat as compared to all other tanking classes. Sure they don't have as many tools for pure avoidance and mitigation but they are balanced so that what they do have is more passive and doesn't require cool downs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lots of good points here. I play a warrior tank and a pally tank. I enjoy both. I am still getting used to the pally as it's my newer tanking toon. One thing I'd like to point out is the fun factor of the warrior charge. I love it. While 15% speed all the time might be better than charge it certainly isn't as fun.</div></div><hr />

Soap box much? Please explain to me oh great one how you rotate through 4 mobs with single target threat while spamming your aoe threat with your rage bar less than full.

It is as close as you can get to a hint at a nerf without straight out saying look for this to get nerfed in 3.1. Till 3.1 its probably going to stand though because I don't see them hot fixing it (although they might). After 3.1 no one is going to be that worried about 3 drakes.</div></div><hr />

I guarantee you that only the people who thrive on this pressure are decent at their roles. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty damn decent at it as well and I can handle the pressure. I'm just tired of having no tanks and no healers when we try to do content. Tanking/healing all the time gets exhausting after awhile. I apologize for not having as big of a epeen as you, but I have tanked in all end game content, so watch who you are saying can't handle. I have healed in all end game raiding content as well, so you are wrong there too. What you fail to realize is that eventually new tanks and healers need brought into the mix and for you to say that if you can't handle the &quot;pressure&quot; of tanking then don't roll a tank is like telling newer players that they should just roll a dps. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you aren't comfortable with it, its not the role for you. That being said, making these roles simple to the point of being elementary doesn't reward those people who actually ENJOY their crucial roles with a) pleasure at completing a challenging task and b) recognition between themselves (a skilled healer) and the horrible healers they are carrying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me guess you are the great one that carries everyone? Give me a break. If you feel the need for something to be hard just so you can brag about how great you are then you need knocked down a peg. Stop assuming everyone but you sucks because it is simply not the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At the moment, healing is an absolute joke. There used to be a time where a raid was able to tell (very easily) if a healer was amazing or horrible. There used to be a time when people had different strategies to both keep their assignments alive and also manage their mana. People had different downranked spells to prevent overhealing. They could fashion their own rotations to maximize their mana depending on who or what kind of damage they were healing. There was decision making involved. And there were consequences if they failed to make the right decisions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Care telling me when this time was? Healing in TBC was an absolute joke as well. Most guilds took one extra healer than was actually needed and as long as you were geared for the content then you were fine. That lasted all the way up to SWP (maybe that is what you are talking about) where Blizzard had to implement a nerf on the classes just to make the content difficult (sunwell radiance or whatever it was called). Healing in vanilla was even easier, so if your argument is that healing in WoW was hard for all of 3 months that was SWP then maybe I will give you that one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Every quality healer i know is utterly bored with what healing has become, and some have even quit the game till things change. They are loathe to pickup dps classes because comparing that to what healing used to be, its boring and routine. <br />
<br />
<br />
Then they would have quit anyways. If they quit because they can't brag about their epeen then they should have quit anyways. They can use whatever excuse they want. What you fail to realize is that new players have to learn to heal to replace the old ones. Blizzard wanting to make it harder on healers is not the best way to encourage new healers. Most guilds have a lack of healers that are consistent in raiding, so Blizzard needs to address that in some matter instead of making it &quot;easier to tell the good healers from the bad ones&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that priests thrive off of over healing correct? You do realize there is a reason that shamans only cast chain heal correct? This idea is a direct nerf to both priests and shamans. Any paladin or druid will be fine because the druid doesn't really do over healing and the paladin has ways to drop threat to 0 even when spamming heals. Not to mention, over healing in and of itself is NOT a bad thing. Its over healing constantly when you don't have the mana to back it up that is the bad thing.</div></div><hr />

first of all, YOU'RE the one that said you didn't like having the &quot;weight of 24 other players&quot; on your back, not me. That being said, any inferences made on your part of me flexing my e-skills is purely your own insecurity talking. I never said &quot;you're bad,&quot; i said people who thrive on that pressure make the best tanks/healers. The people who dont like that pressure will find themselves in a position later on where they ARE responsible, to at least some degree, for other people. Whenever that time comes, they better as hell step up or they will find that they've been pigeonholed in a role that they're not capable of playing well, or that stress them out to the point of being unfun. This wont be the case of the good healers that I know personally, who enjoy this and play best when a lot is expected of them. Its not about bragging about yourself, but people like to be appreciated, and unlike tanks and dps, who have quantifiable ways of displaying how well they're doing (ie a dps meter), assessing the relative skill of a group of healers is much more nebulous. Its not a lot for these exceptionally good players to have a way to a) be recognized as being good at their job and b) not getting confused with people who dont play as well but who's performance is harder to gauge. <br />
<br />
Starting content has been easy enough to introduce new raiders to healing, how to heal, and some (albeit very little) situational events where healers need to think on their feet. If bliz plans to then step it up a bit and ask more of healers in the future, what is wrong in that? Even among casual raiders, many players in WoW feel that most of the content is a joke, and when content doesn't have the satisfaction level of challenges (for dps, tanks, AND healers) there is very little fun associated with raiding at all. The lack of healing in my guild as well as many other guilds on my server can be attributed to one major thing: its not fun, there is very little satisfaction in it at all. If anything, bliz needs to do something to get people who played healing classes but are now dissatisfied with what it has become BACK into the game playing the roles they loved to play in the first place.<br />

I don't agree. What you are saying is people that don't thrive on that pressure are bad tanks. That is not the case. You do not have to thrive on pressure to be a good raid tank. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Whenever that time comes, they better as hell step up or they will find that they've been pigeonholed in a role that they're not capable of playing well, or that stress them out to the point of being unfun.* This wont be the case of the good healers that I know personally, who enjoy this and play best when a lot is expected of them.* <br />
<br />
<br />
Good for you, good for them. The point I'm making is that when the role is the most underplayed in the entire game and is still one of the most needed in the entire game the focus should be on encouraging new healers not making it harder to heal so the &quot;good healers&quot; can test their skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not about bragging about yourself, but people like to be appreciated, and unlike tanks and dps, who have quantifiable ways of displaying how well they're doing (ie a dps meter), assessing the relative skill of a group of healers is much more nebulous.* Its not a lot for these exceptionally good players to have a way to a) be recognized as being good at their job and b) not getting confused with people who dont play as well but who's performance is harder to gauge.* <br />
<br />
<br />
I actually agree with most of this. Measuring the worth of the healer normally comes down to rather the tank died or not in a boss fight even if the healer had no real outcome on rather the tank died or not. If the tank stands in a fire and dies you get blamed. If the tank was under geared you get blamed. If the tank isn't doing their mitigation/avoidance correctly you get the blame. That is just part of being a healer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Nothing. This was never the point I was attempting to make. My point was that they shouldn't balance raid content on the back of healers. They are getting farther away from this by balancing it more on the backs of dps (fights where if you don't have the dps you can't get it down do to enrage or similar mechanics). They rarely actually balance on the back of tanks because threat is a joke now so as long as the tank can pick up mobs quickly then all is well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even among casual raiders, many players in WoW feel that most of the content is a joke, and when content doesn't have the satisfaction level of challenges (for dps, tanks, AND healers) there is very little fun associated with raiding at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is truly sad that you believe this. The fun in raiding should come from the 24 people you are raiding with not your ability to push buttons quickly in the correct order. If the only fun you get from raiding is having to push buttons faster in a better order than you should go play console.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Harder =/= more fun for most people. It might = more fun for you, but I don't think the majority of people want to push themselves to the limit every raid. They might complain that stuff is to easy, but the opposite is the situation where 10% of the population actually raids because it is &quot;to hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
btw, &quot;pretty damn decent&quot; is just another way to say &quot;completely average.&quot;* so grats on being mediocre.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't know me, you have never raided with me, you have never seen what I can do, so grats on having a bigger epeen than I do, but I already agreed with you on that one. We can't all aspire to be on the perfect level like you claim to be. Grats for achieving that though.<br />
<br />

<br />
I can tell healing is pretty boring unless there is very few healers in raid. Most healers are that bad that guilds are required to take 7-8 healers in Naxx.<br />
Tanking is not boring on some difficult encounters like Sart+3 or Malygos 6 min where you have to compete with DPS.<br />
DPSing becomes boring also but I can't say it is less responsibility. If your guild doesn't require you to push 5.5-6k+ DPS then it's your guild where you don't have responsibilities. A lot of guilds stuck at Patchwerk in beginning of WoTLK and it's because DPS was so terrible. Much more guilds stuck at Brutallus in TBC because DPS was not good enough.<br />
<br />
There is check-fights for each spec in game and superior raid-DPS oftenly helps to make content much easier.<br />
E.g. for Sart25+3 you need some good tank and healers if your DPS slack and you are not killing Tenebron before Shadron lands, you are too slow to kill Shadron and Vesperon+Shadron phase lasts for too long. You maybe feel like you weight 24 other players because your DPS was bad and you had to heal more cause of that. If you came on difficult encounter with excellent DPS you will see there is not so much to heal.</div></div><hr />

As for PvP burst...anyone really with mind can imagine how rogue + healer is bursting Dk + Holy pala? lol even without a nerf it was impossible...but with this DK + DK or DK + Pala is just dead setup for any rogue+healer setup...rogue+healer is dead in 2v2 from this moment..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cobrakai</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never said I didn't like it. I said it was a lot to handle. Stop attempting to twist what I say to what you wanted me to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can honestly say that the only time I have actually enjoyed raiding is as a dps because it didn't feel like I was carrying the weight of 24 other people on my shoulders&quot;<br />
<br />
thats what you said. the only time you enjoyed raiding is when you didn't have those responsibilities. You didn't say it was a lot to handle, you implied that the role was not enjoyable. thats not me twisting your words. Thats what you said.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't agree. What you are saying is people that don't thrive on that pressure are bad tanks. That is not the case. You do not have to thrive on pressure to be a good raid tank.<br />
<br />
you're telling me people who do a job and get stressed out or irritated by it will do better than a person who enjoys it? <br />
<br />
<br />
Good for you, good for them. The point I'm making is that when the role is the most underplayed in the entire game and is still one of the most needed in the entire game the focus should be on encouraging new healers not making it harder to heal so the &quot;good healers&quot; can test their skills.<br />
<br />
because its entirely impossible to think that people who are new to the game would enjoy playing a role that has some challenge associated with it. not everyone needs to be coddled.<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually agree with most of this. Measuring the worth of the healer normally comes down to rather the tank died or not in a boss fight even if the healer had no real outcome on rather the tank died or not. If the tank stands in a fire and dies you get blamed. If the tank was under geared you get blamed. If the tank isn't doing their mitigation/avoidance correctly you get the blame. That is just part of being a healer.<br />
<br />
my point is that if people can get recognized with the same sort of pointedness that an amazing tank or an amazing dps'er can, it makes healing more fun, and would encourage more people to play the role (rewards are good).<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing. This was never the point I was attempting to make. My point was that they shouldn't balance raid content on the back of healers. They are getting farther away from this by balancing it more on the backs of dps (fights where if you don't have the dps you can't get it down do to enrage or similar mechanics). They rarely actually balance on the back of tanks because threat is a joke now so as long as the tank can pick up mobs quickly then all is well.<br />
<br />
it needs to be balanced on the backs of ALL roles in a raid, not just healers or dps or tanks. downing a raid boss like this is actually fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is truly sad that you believe this. The fun in raiding should come from the 24 people you are raiding with not your ability to push buttons quickly in the correct order. If the only fun you get from raiding is having to push buttons faster in a better order than you should go play console.<br />
<br />
if all bliz plans to do is make fights more mana intensive then yes, thats bad. What i'm saying is that it needs to be a number of things, of which mana management should always be a part of. <br />
<br />
<br />
Harder =/= more fun for most people. It might = more fun for you, but I don't think the majority of people want to push themselves to the limit every raid. They might complain that stuff is to easy, but the opposite is the situation where 10% of the population actually raids because it is &quot;to hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
theres a difference between content that requires the bleeding edge and content thats challenging enough to be satisfying when you complete it. As ulduar is only t8 level my hope is that it is consistently the latter w/o getting too easy too fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't know me, you have never raided with me, you have never seen what I can do, so grats on having a bigger epeen than I do, but I already agreed with you on that one. We can't all aspire to be on the perfect level like you claim to be. Grats for achieving that though.<br />
<br />
once again, you're inferences, your insecurities. I said nothing about myself, and I only quoted what you said.<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realize that it is hard to take anything that you say actually seriously when your signature is for a level 70 huntard. At this point I am just assuming you are a forum troll that is not worth my time.<br />
<br />
<br />
clearly i am worth your time, b/c you took your time to respond to my post even with a sig i've been too lazy to update. http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Burning+Legion&amp;n=Cobrakai if you're interested in assessing what i've seen and what i haven't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have everyones life in your hands. That means the success of the group often comes down to whether everyone survived long enough to do their jobs.<br />
<br />
Instead of this question being answered by content difficulty, it's usualy answered by a second question:&quot; how retarded are the dps?&quot;<br />
<br />
The only time mana is an issue is when all the melée are standing in blizzard or all the huntards get hit by flame wall repeatedly. I guess the point is: people who are currently spec'd to heal enjoy it. Making it harder to heal retards through self inflicted damage will get your healers in even more of a position of power when they refuse to heal groups of dumbass dps. I know I'll be less inclined to heal pugs, even with dual spec if I don't have the tools to save people from their mistakes.<br />
<br />
As far as the guy throwing warrs and Druids in this &quot;aoe threat deprived tanks&quot; group.. Speak to what you know. Druids have great aoe threat. Naxx 25 dps does not wait at all for threat and they don't need to. A properly geared feral Druid dishes plenty of aoe threat, and does a large amount of dps as well. A warrior that is having trouble should probly look in his spellbook (hint) and start reading those tooktips for talents he bought.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zn</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior tanks are still lacking in aoe threat. They are above druids in over all aoe threat but they are still way behind paladins and dks. The fact that every group has gotten rid of cc and just wants to aoe everything down now means that warriors need a boost and so do druids. Maul should hit 2 targets with a glyph to hit 3 (not 1 to 2). Warriors need an ability that hits 3 targets at the same time as well (on top of thunderclap and shockwave). If that was done then druids and warriors would be on par with paladins and dks when it came to tanking. Until it is done they are way under where they need to be on threat. That does not mean that some very well played warriors can't hold threat to 3 mobs at once, but they definitely have to work harder to do so then paladins or death knights. <br />
<br />
As a boomkin (we thrive on aoe) that loves to spam hurricane for trash I cringe when I'm grouped with a warrior tank because my over all dps takes a nose dive when I end up tanking one or two mobs. I avoided wasting points on talents that reduced my own aggro because they really should not be needed and are not needed in any boss kill and on most trash packs in raids. When I group with paladins or dks (even undergeared ones) I can go all out and not even once have to worry about getting aggro. That has shown me that there is an issue with warriors when it comes to aoe threat. Blizzard needs to either boost the threat of TC and SW or add a new ability similar to hammer of righteous that allows the warrior to hit 3 mobs at a time (maybe an ability that makes sunder armor hit 3 mobs at a time even).<br />
<br />
<br />
Absolutely agree. The other option would be to re-introduce CC to the game. Personally I miss CC. Makes the game seem like a child's game (for pallies and dk's), while making the other 2 tank classes seem incompetent from the aoe dps - and healer's - perspective. <br />
<br />
When you make a change to the game as drastic as removing the need for cc on trash pulls, don't forget to compensate the 2 tank classes that don't have automatic aoe threat abilities. thankyouverymuch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mushin</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way to prevent this is to turn overhealing into extra threat. So if a person is for example spaming to big heal or a group heal when not needed he will get directly punished for it. Person throwing out 5 chainheals doing 5% healing and 95% overhealing should pull agro of any tank. The person doing things wrong will get punished and die - Everyone will see what he did wrong and if he doesn't learn from it in 3-4 deaths he will not be picked again for raids.<br />
<br />
This is possibly the worst change I can imagine.<br />
<br />
Raid healing already requires being aware of more things than dpsing and tanking, and adding yet another thing to watch on top of raid health, raid debuffs, group mana, and the constant lava waves, adds and other shenanigans that Blizzard designs encounters around wouldn't challenge healers, it would break them.<br />
<br />
How do you fix people spamming spells? Stop designing encounters with constant damage. The balance issues behind that are even worse than the current ones healers are facing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You wanne go back to those trash mobs which needed cc and took ages to clear!? I can tell you, as a DPS class im happy to aoe my way through those trash mobs. TBC trash used the be the most boring thing ever. Especially in BT where it could take ages. Im not a tank, but saying u want aoe threat fix and wanne remove it from other tanks, and remove aoe groups seems kinda selfish.<br />

I actually went to bed, then I got back up because this bothered me so much.<br />

If you think making content easier will equal more healers your wrong. You'll get new unexperienced healers, but those of us who have been here for 4 1/2 years are alienated? <br />
<br />
Why am I even playing a game if my skills aren't tested? What's the point? I guess it's to get those elite ilevel 213 naxx loots that my buddys alts get in PuGs. <br />
<br />
I really don't think I'm the minority here, I know so many people on my server that I still raid with or know in about every guild have been here as long as I have. Blizzard can't actually think they're serving a different customer than they were serving when they made BWL or AQ40?</div></div><hr />

Not really.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment announced World of Warcraft on September 2, 2001. The game was released on November 23, 2004. (4 years ~2 1/2 months)<br />
On February 11, 2005, World of Warcraft launched in Europe. (4 years). Anniversary last week.</div></div><hr />

Well, that actually is their goal I think, to serve a different customer. A broader customer. The problem is that they're failing at it. It isn't really their fault, they'd just have to dumb the content down SO much to incorporate everyone into raiding that you literally walk in and press ANY buttons and win. I know it feels like it's already there for some of us, but you know, when you go in raid instance and Mr. Deathknight in 2 pc valorous/2 pc hero's is pulling 1000 dps you see firsthand the scope of this game's user base. If you run with a halfway decent guild you're in a bubble unfortunately. The majority of this game's players are still pretty bad at their classes. I am still seeing mages stack crit before hit, warlocks stacking stamina until their balls explode, tank warriors stacking god knows what stat before defense. <br />
<br />
If only blizzard would do something like the department of public safety and have a &quot;driver's license&quot; for your toons ;p</div></div><hr />

They arent failing at it :D. Alot more ppl are raiding, and so are you probably. So they have succeeded in adding another customer type to the player database. I also think ur overeacting a bit about the difficulty on raid content. For example last week i was in some pug for VOA 25, one of the easiest and pugable bosses. Most the ppl in the pug were like: This is easymode, lets just GO! We ended up wiping 4x and eventually disband the pug. I then started a new pug, and we killed em on a 2nd try.<br />
<br />
Ofc you can say, why go pug? Why inv ppl that just dinged 80? Etc. Compared to TBC its easy yes, but just pressing some buttons randomly, which some ppl clearly do dont get you anywhere. They introduced the raid achievements for the more &quot;hardcore&quot; raiding guilds, and i expect Ulduar to be more like BT or Sunwell.<br />
<br />
Eitherway, the &quot;noob&quot; or &quot;casual&quot; player base is much much bigger then the &quot;hardcore&quot;, so it has been a good decision if they wanted to expand the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did not say the content was that easy yet. I'm saying for them to reach the broad customer base they aspire to, that's where content is headed. The reason I said that is because of what I see every time I pug a group. Usually, a healer can carry bads like this through content because mana regen is pretty overpowered right now, so long fights where dps is terrible, or a rogue is hitting a raid boss from the front, or where the entire group is getting slammed by avoidable damage aren't going to ruin your day. The point is that they're changing healing to make putting up with these players pretty unappealing. At least right now it is a challenge that can be overcome. Depending on how they handle the change to mana, it will be back to only healing for guild where you can at least hold others somewhat accountable for doing retarded things.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dr. D</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think of the group not yourself. Paladins don't need shield wall. I very rarely use divine protection. Being &quot;block capped&quot; is huge as compared to other tanks. Our &quot;last stand&quot; is on a 20 minute cool down and gives up back 100% health. In most raid situations, a 20 minute cool down (which can be talented to 16 minutes if you chose to go into holy) is normally enough that it always comes up during the next boss fight.<br />
<br />
Our &quot;charge&quot; (Pursuit of Justice) is 15% speed increase and 50% reduction on disarm affects. It is much more useful then actual charge will ever be. <br />
<br />
We don't need vigilance because we already do more threat (even single target) than a warrior and all vigilance does is redirect the threat of the person doing the most aggro and in cases of aoe aggro its still not enough.<br />
<br />
After 3.1 we will have more interrupts than a rogue. We don't need spell reflect. <br />
<br />
Warriors need help to be on par with paladins not the other way around. Paladins already take the least spiky damage and have the best threat as compared to all other tanking classes. Sure they don't have as many tools for pure avoidance and mitigation but they are balanced so that what they do have is more passive and doesn't require cool downs.<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll have silences which dont work on bosses, and whats going to happen with the exorcism glyph isnt clear yet. You have to put alot of useless points into ret tree to get PoJ - charge is baseline.<br />
<br />
Warriors dont need buffs.</div></div><hr />

Yeah its a joke. But I'm forced to believe that they want DK's and palas to be OP, or else they would have changed it by now. Probably all the devs now play dks and palas, thats why they dont get nerfed.<br />
<br />
But Blizzard, just don't fucking nerf rogues anymore because you need to do SOMETHING okay? Go make more achievements, we need more of those!</div></div><hr />
