Guess there's no real story to support it but it would be fun :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gore</div><div class="date">2007-06-22, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont understand hyjal much :S is the idea u are defending the towns and then after a certain number of waves the boss comes, how come theres bosses at alliance towns? if were hrode we defend that too :o :o</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-22, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the whole point of the battle actually, horde and alliance fighting together to stop Archimonde. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gore</div><div class="date">2007-06-22, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also just to let you know, i did the old jump into hyjal in azeroth trick /pray no gm's are here and got to that southern part. Theres a isntnace portal u can walk through into a lair which looks like onxyias but is much bigger, possible 25 man in the future i think :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-22, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, it's been here for some time, a huge part of Hyjal is unused anyway and they'll probably add something related to the scourge according to the layout of some of the empty zones.</div></div><hr />
