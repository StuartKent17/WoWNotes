<br />
Patch 4.3 Hotfixes: December 6<br />
General<br />
<br />
Transmogrified items should always lose their transmogrification when mailed.<br />
The Darkmoon Firework no longer has a duration, is now holiday-bound, and requires Darkmoon Faire to be active.<br />
Darkmoon Faire revelers who enter an off-limits area in ghost form should now be properly ported out.<br />
Entangling Roots, Freeze, and Frost Nova should now properly break when the affected player takes damage while a damage absorption effect is also active.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />

<br />
Kill Command should now always consume the Resistance is Futile! buff, regardless of whether the target has Hunter's Mark or not.<br />
Reverted a bug fix that caused Bombardment to be consumed by the next Multi-Shot. Fixing this bug proved to be a significant dps loss, so Bombardment once again lasts for its full 6 second duration regardless of the number of Multi-Shot casts. The tooltip will be updated in a future patch to reflect that this change is intended.<br />

Darkmoon Faire Items Are Too Expensive<br />
Thanks everyone for your feedback. To hopefully clear up some of the confusion over time investment vs reward costs we've broken down exactly how many tickets you can obtain in a single Darkmoon Faire week. The design intent of the Darkmoon Faire is that it’s available for one week out of the month, and in that one week we expect you to be able to obtain a significant amount of tickets. To clarify the OP’s point of how long it would take to obtain an entire set of cosmetic gear, the math presented was incorrect, and it would in fact only take 4 Darkmoon Faire weeks to complete an entire set. That’s of course still no quick task, and the intent is not for it to be. There are plenty of rewards that can be obtained in one or two weeks of the Darkmoon Faire, but we expect that an entire set will take a few events to obtain. Here’s the breakdown: <br />
<br />
Tickets Per Faire<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon: 40<br />
Heroic Dungeon: 15<br />
Raid: 10<br />
Tradeskill quests (primary): 8<br />
Tradeskill quests (secondary): 12<br />
BGs: 15<br />
Kill Quest: 10<br />
Mini Games*: 35<br />
<br />
Total Tickets per faire: 145<br />
<br />
* 5 mini games, available daily: 7*5=35<br />
<br />
As an example, here are some options that you can choose over the course of two Darkmoon Faires (2 weeks over 2 months):<br />
<br />
<br />
Prioritizing mounts/pets: 1 mount + 1 pet, with 20 tickets to spare<br />
Prioritizing pets: 3 pets, 20 tickets to spare<br />
Prioritizing cosmetic armor: 4 pieces of cosmetic armor, with 30 tickets to spare<br />
Prioritizing heirloom armor: 1 piece of heirloom armor + 1 heirloom weapon, with 20 tickets to spare<br />
<br />
<br />
Keeping all of this in mind we don’t feel the current ticket acquisition rates or reward costs are out of hand, but we’re interested to hear your thoughts after reading this information and considering the longevity of the content, as well as the ‘once a month’ format of the faire. We’ll be continually evaluating it, and we’re looking forward to incorporating more goodies to be won, and more activities to the faire, in the future.<br />
<br />
We're not attempting to recreate the time investment that was originally seen to obtain these items when they were relevant. They exist for transmogrification/customization choices, not necessary power increase requirements to be able to progress your character.<br />
<br />
If they were part of a progression path we'd definitely look at the acquisition rates and standardize them, but as they're show-off pieces the acquisition rate is usually gated a little higher so that the appeal and worth of showing them off remains high. <br />
<br />
Just to clarify one point, the quest drops that happen in the dungeons/raids/BG’s happen all the time, even if the faire isn’t in town. Think of it sort of like the Darkmoon Card redemptions. You’re out playing all month, while you’re doing stuff you’re getting chances at the items, then when the faire is in town you turn it all in. (It’s also worth pointing out that the turn-in items aren’t soulbound, so just like the cards I’d expect some people to farm them just to put them up on the AH.)<br />
<br />
It’s really just this first week and appearance of the faire that’s off because the Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide wasn’t available for the 3 weeks prior. When it rolls around next month there should be better feel for how the whole system and ticket acquisition rate feels. <br />
<br />
Why is there a perception both within the community and from the developers that there should be a lower acquisition rate for people who want to customize how their character looks compared to those who simply want higher stats?<br />
<br />
It's a simple fact of the intent behind the vanity rewards and people's desires to customize their appearance, and do so in a way that they are unique from other players. To be unique, or close to it, the desire is to have something to show off that no one else has, or at least very few people have. Secondarily (or in some cases primarily) the appeal of the item can simply be due to some very difficult-to-reach goal. &quot;Look at me, I did X&quot;. To achieve that from our side there needs to be a high barrier of entry to obtain the item or else everyone can get it, the item loses its special 'show off' value, and as a way to be unique from other players it has completely lost all value. This isn't just a dress up game, the items have significance attached to how they were obtained. Some things, like pets or mounts, have alternate values through achievements and such though, so things can get a bit more complex.<br />
<br />
Obviously it doesn't apply to everything, there are nigh unlimited amounts of ways now to customize your character with transmogrification. The vast majority of customization options don't require a ton of time investment. But if you look at these items in the Darkmoon Faire, or the mounts or pets that are hard to obtain, and you really want them to dress up and show off, I think that's proving the exact point of why they're difficult to obtain.<br />
<br />
I'll bring up the sparkle ponies. When they came out everyone wanted one and sure enough on the first day the sky was filled with sparkles, and ponies, but now days you rarely see anyone bring theirs out because they became too common. You see people, usually, on their rarest/most difficult to obtain mount, because that's the satisfaction of obtaining these things and then displaying them in a social setting. &quot;This is who I am, and this is what I've achieved.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hold on, hold on. Aren't you guys the people who have, for years, told everyone who complained about other players getting rare things easier after time had past that they shouldn't complain because, after all, they had those things and got to enjoy them longer than players who are now able to get the items far easier?<br />
<br />
Time changes all. We're not going to be able to keep everything in the game relatively &quot;difficult&quot; to obtain from now until forever. There are going to be game changes or a progression of player power that simply makes some of their acquisitions easier. We can try to build in gates, such as lockouts and timers to help mitigate them, but it's very possible that at some point in the future the Darkmoon Faire items become substantially easier to obtain through some change.<br />
<br />
As time goes on more and more people will naturally be able to achieve these desired 'show off' items, and so as time goes on it makes sense to continue to introduce new ones. Being the first, or one of a few is awesome, but unless we do something like the AQ gong event again (never) we're not going to literally gate items to a specific number of people.<br />
<br />
Such is the reality of a constantly moving and evolving game. It's a big reason why we use words and phrases like &quot;currently&quot; and &quot;at this time&quot;, we can't speak to how we're going to be thinking or designing the game a year from now, or what items will be available and at what cost. <br />
<br />
I understand the intent of obtaining items to customize your character, and I would absolutely argue that it is not devoid of wanting to appear special/unique to those around you. World of Warcraft is not a strict 'roleplaying' game, in that the majority of focus is on cooperative or competitive group-based content, and much of that is to obtain and earn prestige through displayable rewards. Because of that our intent is largely going to be to create methods through which that prestige can be obtained. That doesn't mean everything has to be some kind of crazy long time investment, and it's a fact that World of Warcraft asks very little in that regard for 98% of the content, but surely there needs to be some that are very difficult to appease those who are looking for it. I would also argue the Darkmoon Faire and its items are not one of them, though, and do not ask an out-of-the-ordinary amount of dedication to obtain the rewards. <br />
<br />
We were not requesting the items be very easy to obtain, we're requesting that the time it takes to acquire such items be reduced by adding 2-3 more tokens to the daily rewards.<br />
<br />
We're more than willing to take feedback on how the rates could be adjusted, but at this time we feel four months to obtain a full set seems about right, should you choose to not seek them out through other means (trading/AH). Of course should we decide to make any adjustments we'll let you know as soon as we do. <br />
<br />
This, it seems to me, is related to the assumption on Blizz's part that the only &quot;valid&quot; purpose for Transmogrification is prestige-- to show off the armor we earned, preferrably in an attempt to look more powerful and awesome. But many of us are not in fact motivated by that-- we're motivated by the desire to customize our characters to make them look the way we want, according to our own feel for our characters-- whether that feel is &quot;powerful and awesome&quot; or &quot;silly and quaint&quot;.<br />
<br />
No and I apologize for using that phrase, my intent wasn't to devalue character customization it was to make a point that the items don't just exist in the world for baseless customization, but they're either obtained by killing a boss, being great in the Arena's, or even putting time into gathering enough tickets so you can look awesome.<br />
<br />
Like I said before there are tons of customization options that are very, very easy to obtain, and the combinations and customization potential is really insane. But, there are going to be restrictions and requirements to get what's considered the higher prestige items because that's in no small part what makes them prestigious, and drives people to obtain them. I understand that may not be why you play the game, but it is why the majority of people play, and the majority of the content that's developed.<br />
<br />
We're in the infancy of transmogrification though, and so I don't think we really have any idea where we'll be six months or a year from now and the various venues we could have available to obtain pure-customization options for your character.

Expand the LFR Loot System to all 5 Man Instances<br />
I just wanted to let you all know that we would indeed like to expand this loot system to 5-player dungeons as well. However this is something we are looking into for the future, but we would like to see how the loot system holds up in a raiding environment first. So hopefully we may introduce this to 5 man dungeons soon™ (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/208382/suggestion-expand-the-lfr-loot-system-to-all-5man) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3061917103?page=1#17))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaeleena</div><div class="date">2011-12-07, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tl;dr of the Darkmoon Faire discussion is that they don't really care about how you may have been really lucky and been able to farm out the Dungeons Set 1 and 2 gear in a single week before they removed it from the game. All they care about is ensuring people who want the same opportunity to reacquire those armor pieces now are locked into a 4 month subscription before they can even use the full set for transmogrification purposes. That's low Blizz. Really really low. You can easily collect a full set of tier from any set in a month or so and you want people who just want the look of gear that they probably used to have to take an inordinate amount of time to get.<br />
<br />
There's no prestige in transmogrification if the items are still available in the game. If you wanted to put them back in the game, you should've put them back into the game on the same bosses you took them off of originally. Sticking them on vendors and only allowing players to attain a single piece of it for transmog per month just smacks of greed.</div></div><hr />

Yup, they should.<br />

US First would imply they weren't world first. This kinda thing happens all the time.<br />

Europe gets a world first, it doesn't get classified as &quot;EU First&quot;, it just gets world first.<br />

Youre wrong.<br />
EU servers are still under maintaince. <br />
When theyre up the race begins, EU still has a chance to get world firsts, they just have to be faster to kill the HC bosses after the server got up, than BL.<br />

Sounds like the have-nots trying for things they've already lost. Disadvantaged by Blizz is no excuse to complain.<br />

Pulleeeezee. Don't you realise that the LFR bug was intentionally left in so that top guilds would abuse it, get banned, and be forced to put off progression for a full week, so that the world first Deathwing would still be in contention while SWTOR is released? The slashing of prices confirm this! The whole thing is a conspiracy I tell you.<br />
<br />
If not for the bug, Paragon and Ensidia would kill Deathwing this week and then quit WoW for SWTOR, true story.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but trying to downplay the people who didn't cheat like low-life scuzbuckets isn't going to work with anyone who has a brain. These are the types of players that deserve to be held up on a pedestal.

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dieing<br />
<br />
And WoW ain't DYING slowly, it's simply on a decline. All games go through it, but WoW is THE BIGGEST ever in it's field and as uch, the numbers are greater.<br />
<br />
WoW don't need a new graphics engine, people obsessed with &quot;realism&quot; can go to other games...WoW is still on top and will be for nobody knows how long, but certainly not 1 year or whatever crap the haters throw around them.<br />
<br />
Other MMOs have been online and active for decades, so the fact some people think that WoW will die from declining subs = there's a lot of proper derps around.</div></div><hr />

Actually it makes them better all the way around for NOT cheating the system. Those other guilds got what they deserved and hopefully lost their shot at world first, if you can't do it honestly you shouldn't get it at all. If those &quot;other&quot; guilds wanted to win so much they should have used commonsense instead of greed.</div></div><hr />

When you first enter darkmoon faire talk to the undead npc and get your toon a &quot;darkmoon faire adventure guide&quot; the name might not be exact but it's the only one there so you'll know when you have it, it will say that it will allow you to find things that you might of missed otherwise, in dungeons , battlegrounds etc . Please look on wowhead for the achievement &quot;Darkmoon Despoiler&quot; , a big comment there by a user will let you know of all the quest starting items and where they drop, you can only turn ONCE, one of each , every month i think. So with those you get to the numbers he mentioned there. Hope it helped :)<br />
<br />
Edit : Also you can find those quest items at AH too , but overpriced most likely since they do drop in lower dungeons , most of them.</div></div><hr />

I think they are talking about the +100 roll bonus for MS, rather than the one roll per boss. I am sort of liking this, as I have been trying to get the tanking shoulders since patch release, and my fear is that some plate dps will roll and win them when they finally drop. 14 Arch Ben kills and counting ...</div></div><hr />

Reverted a bug fix that caused Bombardment to be consumed by the next Multi-Shot. Fixing this bug proved to be a significant dps loss, so Bombardment once again lasts for its full 6 second duration regardless of the number of Multi-Shot casts. The tooltip will be updated in a future patch to reflect that this change is intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
How exactly does a bug change the tooltip to start with?? can't they just admit they were wrong nerfing it and they just reverted the nerf??</div></div><hr />

No it means nothing because they didn't beat them on an equal ground. They are still not better than the other guilds. Paragon is still the the best guild. Just like Ensidia's LK kill didn't matter because they used an exploit.</div></div><hr />

Transmogrified items should always lose their transmogrification when mailed.<br />

<br />
Wow, so it was a bug that you could sometimes mail transmogrified heirlooms, not a bug that it sometimes didn't work? I wasted nearly 1500g trying to transmog my BoA helms and cloaks, since they vendor for 375g/300g each.

Not that I care for this world first nonsense, but how can someone be world first if the rest of the world can't even do content, because it's not available. <br />
<br />
<br />
This would be similar to a race, where only one driver is allowed to start, while rest are kept in the pits until the guy who started alone drove 50 laps already. And then he would be champion of the race... doesn't make any sense what so ever. <br />
<br />
<br />
They still might earn world first status, afaik once the times of kills from the EU and rest are in.</div></div><hr />

I think someone.. maybe even mmo .. should/could make a special clock that puts the difference between US going live and EU going live.. to calculate the time competatively... Jus an example... US Blood Legion (World First +8hrs from EU launch..) or something like that... then wait 8 hours from the EU launch.. and if at that exact time (8 hours after the launch) .. look at the EU guilds.. if a EU guild kills the boss 8+ .. then obv US has the REAL world first.. the competative one.. if the EU guild kills the boss under 8 hrs.. then EU guild wins the REAL world first... Simply adding the hour difference in the tables.. would make the &quot;Competative&quot; Calendar more accurate.. obv US guilds will always get atleast the first boss world firsts.. cuz they have a go at the boss faster... but not the Competative world first... sry for my bad english...</div></div><hr />

Don't get me started on the Yearly pass, because it's clearly another plan for them to tie in players until... the Titan Beta. Are you prepared for you next dose of virtual CRACK!?<br />
<br />
This time around if you sign up for the year pass, you get Diablo 3 and guaranteed access to the MoP Beta, in Q4 2012, they will announce that if you sign up for another year, you will get access to the Titan beta (which will be launched in Q4 2013 (http://media1.gameinformer.com/imagefeed/featured/blizzard/blizzardproductslate.jpg)).<br />

That is pretty wrong and dangerous. Uninformed people like you are always dangerous, you guys try to spread your opinion based on misinformation. BL used an exploit on this years Blizzcons Live Raid (Mage died, because Beth tilac was fixed on Blizzcon). <br />

Every Guild, who killed Atramedes in the first weeks used an exploit, because he wasn´t killable without using an exploit. There are many more examples...<br />

<br />
Lets look at the Tour de France, a team-focused race where doping, and thusly getting busted for it, is probably more frequent than any other pro sport ... <br />
<br />
If a favorite or leader is caught doping while the race is going on, and removed from competition, it doesn't soil the victory for the person who winds up winning. If you cheat, and get caught, you simply are no longer &quot;competition&quot;.<br />
<br />
You'll just have to accept the fact that for this tier, the guilds who were banned aren't considered the best players, by their very own actions. 5.0 will probably bring a different picture.<br />

To the best of our knowledge the Miss Universe Pageant has representatives from every known species of Human in the Universe. I'm certain that in the future, when we have Extraterrestrial Humans, they will be allowed to participate.<br />
<br />
Having a &quot;World&quot; Series, knowing that there are other countries in the world not competing is misleading at best, blatantly arrogant arrogant at worst. Coming from Ireland, I could declare that we have the best Hurling teams in the world, and that would be true, but laughable, as we're the only country that plays it competitively. <br />
<br />
This is why any attempt to discuss world first with US vs EU is always going to fail because there will always just be so many people trolling. Anyone who logically tries to express the concept of different maintenance days just gets the comment &quot;lol butthurt, QQ moar world furst = world furst, noob&quot;.

Cute :) Pretty sure it was done like twice and only 4 extra items were looted. Was that deserving of a ban? I don't think so. Also, Kay and Taeyeon were not in the raid and it was kind of an extra-curricular thing, where like 20 people participated.

I agree with you, it is misleading, but the name was coined long before the world became as globalized as it is now. The US (and Canada) was pretty much the World to those players back then. On the topic of world firsts, I probably don't understand the complexities of it all, but couldn't we just count the EU kills as date-of-kill-1 (or vice versa) to account for the disparity between US and EU? Then if someone in the EU got a kill a day after, but at an earlier time, than the US kill, the EU guild would be creditted the world first?<br />

ETA: Thanks to whoever posted the wowhead comment bit about the non-faireground-related Darkmoon tickets. I've been sitting here frowning at my screen thinking I wouldn't have enough for the one bit of replica gear I'm after.</div></div><hr />

No one does the bloody place to begin with, so why not leave it as is. haha. I'm trying to hit exalted so it's lame that they took that out. The faster I'm outta that place the better, but what can you do. It is what it is.</div></div><hr />

Additionally, I had planned to suspend my account after I got them until Mists of Pandaria came out. Unfortunatel Blizzard has nerfed these quests to string us along and artificially cause us to deal with the darkmoon faire longer. Instead of giving us more quests, more dailies, or more content to hold our interest they've decided to make the content we've got last longer and be more drawn-out.Shame on you blizzard. At least the Argent Tournament had levels, and branches of quests, and rep to g as well as an instance.</div></div><hr />

It sucks that they made everything so much easier for 10man so far.<br />
<br />
On normal mode at least I found lootship easier on 25m, so maybe the last bosses will be that way. I hope so anyway. 10m world firsts are just disappointing to me...they feel less epic somehow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets look at the Tour de France, a team-focused race where doping, and thusly getting busted for it, is probably more frequent than any other pro sport ... <br />
<br />
If a favorite or leader is caught doping while the race is going on, and removed from competition, it doesn't soil the victory for the person who winds up winning. If you cheat, and get caught, you simply are no longer &quot;competition&quot;.<br />
<br />
You'll just have to accept the fact that for this tier, the guilds who were banned aren't considered the best players, by their very own actions. 5.0 will probably bring a different picture.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because Tour de France = WoW and doping = using an exploit in a videogame.<br />
<br />
Let's say the top 20 of the Tour the France is out of the race. Do you really give the number 21 credit for winning because he is so awesome? No, no one would care anymore because the whole race is fucked up because you know that those other 20 guys are better in a fair race.<br />
<br />

I am going to laugh real hard when another guild gets DW WF.</div></div><hr />
