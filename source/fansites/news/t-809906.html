A couple of guilds are leading the world progression, almost all the normal modes are down now and only Nefarian is left for 4 of those guilds. Apparently there wasn't any shortage of level 85 players and most of these kills seems to be in 25-man mode (according to Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/)'s website at least, not sure about the other guilds).<br />
<br />
The progression is faster than what I expected from people who barely had time to run heroic instances, and it will be interesting to see how things go when people start working on heroic versions of the encounters next week. <br />

World of Warcraft Cataclysm Performance<br />
Tom's Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.com/) posted a very useful performance guide for Cataclysm. The entire article is a must-read (http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm-directx-11-performance,2793.html) if you plan to upgrade your computer anytime soon, keep in mind that this article is only about performance in WoW Cataclysm and things can be very different in other games (mostly thinking about multi GPU cards here). <br />
<br />
There's also a few comparisons of DirectX9 vs DirectX11 performance, if you have an high-end GPU card it looks like you will definitely want to activate the DX11 Support to get even more FPS! To do that, simply edit the config.wtf file in your /WTF/ folder and add SET gxApi &quot;d3d11&quot; to it.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Justice/Valor Points and Epic vs Rare Items<br />
If this is coming from a sense of blue&lt;purple then it's something that you should get used to. Epics are intentionally more epic again, they're not thrown at you as soon as you walk in the door like in Wrath. And, because of that, you're going to need to equip what you can to progress. <br />
<br />
Could you speak a bit on the topic of what the intended role of JP is, right now?<br />
To be the lower currency, that's always its role.<br />
<br />
Right now it's giving you heroic blues, valor is giving raid epics, when the next tier hits JP will buy those old raid epics (as well as the heroic blues), and valor will buy the new hotness.<br />
<br />
It's exactly the same as Frost/Triumph except instead of introducing a new currency each time and making it a confusing mess it's the same two currencies (Valor and Justice Points) and they simply rotate down once there's something new.<br />
<br />
[...] At the release of a new tier all Valor points are converted to JP. It's in effect the same, as I said, as Frost/Triumph. Valor becomes, essentially, a new currency with each tier. JP continually collects the old items and points as it moves along. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142360/valor--jp-points-wait-a-second-what))<br />

Uldum Quests Hotfix<br />
We're currently working to address this issue with a hotfix and ensure that players who accidentally leave Obelisk of the Stars before accepting Field Work can still continue the quest chain. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142488/harrison-jones-uldum-quest-line-problem))<br />
<br />
Transmute: Living Elements in Deepholm<br />
We're aware that performing Transmute: Living Elements (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/78866/transmute-living-elements/) while in Deepholm does not currently yield any Volatile Earth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52327/volatile-earth/) and are working to apply a hotfix as we speak.<br />
<br />
Please note that once this hotfix is applied, you will no longer receive both Volatile Air (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52328/volatile-air/) and Volatile Earth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52327/volatile-earth/) when using the transmute in Uldum. Instead, you will only receive Volatile Air (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52328/volatile-air/) (excluding bonus procs). This was an unintended side-effect and will be addressed shortly. Thanks!<br />

Honestly, I'm surprised Nefarian isn't down yet. :o I'm sure they all have near full raid level epics now from vendors and from the two weeks of raiding (EU got an extra week in from tues to wedns).<br />
<br />
This must mean that Nefarian is actually REALLY hard on Normal.<br />

Either of two things will probably happen, a fail safe kicks in and it reverts to default, or it simply wont run.<br />
<br />
That said, DX11 on my GTX 570 SC gave me a huge increase in FPS, not surprised to see the same results posted by Toms Hardware. Game runs so perfectly flawless even though I've got a CPU bottleneck.</div></div><hr />

Hey man! USA had it's first world kill also! It was that dragon dude in that raid next to Obsidian Sanctum, because European realms where offline for a day lol.<br />
<br />
But i agree on those &quot;first kills&quot;, personally i don't care about minor ones. The only &quot;first kill&quot; i respect is Yogg+0 by Stars, because it was not about who gets there first and sits longer. Come to think of it... I think that's the only kill i liked =? &quot;Just beat it! Just beat it! Au! You gota show them that you really don't care...&quot; sorry, got carried away for a lil bit :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, if you buy 580, you either 1)play it on ZOMG WTF BIIIIIIIIIIIIG RESOLUTION (&gt;2560x1600) or 2) at least 1920x1200 and 3D. <br />
<br />
If you buy this card and play at, say, 1920x1200 without 3D ― gz, you just totally wasted money, instead you coulda bought GTX 460. ;)<br />

Because it does better in everything that ISN'T WoW. <br />
<br />
http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/162?vs=180<br />
<br />
You DOUCHEBAG, 460 is mid range card, while 5870 is hi-end. GTX 480 or GTX 580 is the hi-end. Here, even 480 beats the crap out of your ATi: http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/162?vs=158. And please don't link 5970, it's just 5870 on CF in single card, we should compare that to 480 SLI... aaand nVidia would win. ;)<br />
<br />
ATi has craptardic drivers (especially on Linux/Mac OS X), are slower. But they produce less heat and, IIRC, uses less watts. And (a little biass here) provide better quality for multiple monitors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Resa</div><div class="date">2010-12-11, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding Dx11:<br />
DX11 mode is available to users with DX10 &amp; DX11 cards, running Windows 7, or a fully up to date Vista install (requires SP2 and a specific update afterwards). Wow will internally switch pixelshaders, etc based on what type of card is installed (Dx10 cards will run 4.0, DX11 cards will run 5.0). <br />
<br />
Also note those running Windows 7 with a DX11 card shouldn't need to enable it, as the engine SHOULD be automatically setting you to this (whether it is or not is another story).<br />
<br />
Enabling DX11 mode on an XP system will have the game engine reset the setting to DX9.<br />
<br />
Devs are still learning about optimizing for DX11, and are actively working with Microsoft to optimize the game engine further for those able to use DX11 mode.<br />
<br />
All of this is from what Blizz reps have stated time &amp; time again in the US Wow Tech Support forum.</div></div><hr />

Granted it would probably need a seriously major render engine overhaul, but then again, it would be about time, considering the game is updated regularly, why not also update the now really old render engine as a whole, not just adding modern features once every expansion.<br />
<br />
It would look better (not saying different, but better) and it would certainly run a lot better too. It's not a small project, but then again Blizzard isn't small either. <br />
<br />
As for the test, I didn't go to Tom's but 1650x1080 test, don't interest me, as this resolution is dead on desktops, and even notebooks/laptops are going past it really fast. I would also like to see how WoW perfroms on a Radeon with 3 monitors in &quot;eyefinity&quot; at 1920x1200 each, to exchange my aging Matrox TH2G and nvidias 295GTX as it only allows me to push that dreadful 1050 res for a total of 5040x1050, 5760x1200 sounds much better for conformity.</div></div><hr />

Why would you post an image from wowprogress for top 5 world when the EU got to raid and kill bosses last reset but US didn't. Paragon got 35 epics and then all those valor points for being EU. Its unfair imo and you should use top 3 for each region instead of a top 5 world.</div></div><hr />

The string gets moved in the Config.WTF. If you placed it at the bottom of the config file it's unlikely to stay there after you run the game. It moves further up the config file. Perhaps that's it ?</div></div><hr />

Wow I find myself almost agreeing with such an angry post. It makes me feel dirty, but I kind of like it. <br />
<br />
Honestly though, on topic who really cares about &quot;hey cata has been out a week and we finished it&quot;...well awesome for you. You just paid 60$ plus 15 a month to say you beat it in the first week. I would rather take my time and enjoy it. I guess if you want to be the type to &quot;race&quot; to the end then that's cool. It isn't really a race though when you have a head start, and a map showing where each pitfall is. The other guys are having to start normal, plus they are stumbling their way through it. So meh, I think they should get some credit. Realistically that isn't going to happen. There is just no way the owner of this site could go through all of that information and be like &quot;well this guy l eft guild X that was in the beta to join Y so Y can't be on the list&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Multi-GPU setups can significantly increase FPS, particularly when you start pushing water and shadow visuals.<br />
<br />
us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1305770941<br />
<br />
Those are benchmarks that I personally did using a Radeon 5970. Tom's Hardware's article just seems way off. A few of us over in the Tech Support's live chat (#wowtech) have been discussing the results as of late as well. The numbers just don't add up. Other players have found more positive scaling with multiple GPUs as well, and I've not found any claim to completely back up the AMD/Intel CPU differences.<br />
<br />
I would take the Tom's Hardware results with a huge grain of salt. Something wasn't done right. If they were playing in windowed mode, multi-GPU setups will get lower FPS than they should, but the difference shouldn't be that large. Not using Catalyst Application Profiles + DX11 doesn't show what multi-GPU systems are truly capable of. There are many factors to take into consideration, but no matter what way you cut it, something just isn't right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree with half of your post. I agree that people like Athene who pledged his reason why he got to 85 first is a bid retarded. I would be more impressed if he did it all by leveling by himself instead of requiring people to help him. <br />
<br />
As for the disagreement, I disagree that paragon, ensidia and all the guilds who got their kills deserve it. The reason is because their goal was to test shit out for Blizzard so that they can make sure that everyone has no problem running the bosses. Also Nefarion isn't hard; according to an ensidia post, they said that Nefarion is bugged at the moment. Which further proves my point on why Paragon and the rest deserve their kills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. But they also raided most of these bosses on a regular basis in the Beta didn't they? Sure they're better than most of us, but I'm still not all that surprised/impressed that they've progressed so far so quickly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buzzinjoe</div><div class="date">2010-12-11, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering that WoW is a game from 2004 with some major and minor engine revamps, those cards should be able to push 600fps if so desired, but sadly Blizzard will not put the stress on the GPU but rather occupy the CPU. Granted it would probably need a seriously major render engine overhaul, but then again, it would be about time, considering the game is updated regularly, why not also update the now really old render engine as a whole, not just adding modern features once every expansion.<br />
<br />
It would look better (not saying different, but better) and it would certainly run a lot better too. It's not a small project, but then again Blizzard isn't small either. <br />
<br />
As for the test, I didn't go to Tom's but 1650x1080 test, don't interest me, as this resolution is dead on desktops, and even notebooks/laptops are going past it really fast. I would also like to see how WoW perfroms on a Radeon with 3 monitors in &quot;eyefinity&quot; at 1920x1200 each, to exchange my aging Matrox TH2G and nvidias 295GTX as it only allows me to push that dreadful 1050 res for a total of 5040x1050, 5760x1200 sounds much better for conformity.<br />
<br />
I love how you complain about a dead resolution being tested (1680x1050) and then go to talk about how things should be tested in 1920x1200, which also happens to be a dead resolution. Seems a bit contradictory doesn't it?<br />
Everything is being streamlined to 1080p.</div></div><hr />

If I learned one thing being in the the last Beta, it's that there is a significantly higher concentration of self-important, egotistical &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders in the beta.

<br />
That said, so much butthurt on this thread. These guilds didn't ruin anything for themselves, they were doing this content back when everyone else was sitting around Dalaran with nothing to do. While we all are doing T11 they will be betaing T12. Also, most of these guys actually do have lives but make space for a few weeks of hardcore raiding a few times a year. No different than anyone else who is intense about a hobby. When content is on farm they raid less than bad guilds because it is a quick clear.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how just because EU guilds are better at raiding than yours, that means we don't get the appropriate amount of &quot;pussy&quot; as you like to call it.</div></div><hr />

It's the same mistake all over again. Gear reset EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PATCH IS BAD. Stop it. You have great 5 man content right now, why oh WHY must you ruin it along the way and return back to Wrath's faceroll? That's just fucking stupid and makes no damn sense.<br />
<br />
It actually makes perfect sense; heroic and 5-man only players need progression too. Imagine if all you did was heroics, and eventually you got all the blue gear and had your character kitted out in every heroic blue you had access to. Great... now what? Yes, you can still keep running heroics for fun, but you no longer have a &quot;goal&quot; to work towards, a carrot on a stick if you will. Gear is only one such &quot;carrot&quot;, but it is a carrot; it's less about OMG GEEEEAAAR GUYZ and more about, &quot;I want an opportunity to improve and advance my character and work towards a tangible goal.&quot; Thus, it makes sense to unlock new gear after a certain amount of time so that heroic-only players will have new goals to work towards.<br />
<br />
Not saying that that is the only way it could be done, mind you, but one thing that somewhat annoys me about people who say that heroic-only players should never get &quot;raid&quot; gear is that they don't suggest what they should be getting instead (after they get all the heroic blues, I mean). Some reasonably decent alternatives might include more 5 man content every single patch (and if they did that, I *sincerely* hope raiders would not complain that &quot;OMG they're wasting resources on 5 mans!&quot; while still thinking heroic-only players shouldn't get new gear) or to have more trade goods or vanity items available only with Justice Points so that heroic-only players could set themselves up as sellers of reagents and cute pets. If you have another alternative to these, I'd love to hear it.<br />
<br />
Also, consider that, if nothing else, the system set forth by Blizz is much kinder to alts. Unless you genuinely want to keep running older raid content in order to help new players and alts gear up (and if you do, that's genuinely fantastic, but I sometimes feel that the players who rail against raid-gear-through-heroics would also complain if they had to help walk newer toons through the entire raid progression to help them catch up... so what are fellow guildmates trying to catch up supposed to do then?)</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify our kill, it was made in a 10 man raid, because of an issue with a soft reset despawn. Every other boss was done in a 25 man version. Anyway, at least in a 10 man raid this seems to be a world first and according to blizzard 10 and 25 man raids are equal. Attaching the link with a screenshot below<br />

<br />
You got vertical sync on? But anyway if you fps is higher than 60 means yout card over-performs your current setting and you should try a higher setting, since technically you cannt see the difference between 60fps and 60+fps.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the guy doest give much useful information like recommand settings for each card but nevertheless interesting read.</div></div><hr />

Shall we say attitude problems? They shouldn't be expected to be competitive in the endgame until they get their act together and perhaps some semblance of standards in regard to how they handle exploits. <br />
<br />
Not to rag on Ensidia, they got some impressive kills especially at the start if Wrath, but if they were that good why is there all this heating drama?</div></div><hr />

Nobody and I mean nobody gives a flying fuck about a guild who was ON BETA cheating their asses off on live to get where they are. How about you post guilds that were NOT on beta and I might give them grats.<br />
<br />
Hell, how about not post guild progression at all. Why does the world need to see the e-peen stroking shit? Europe got ages ahead of USA in everything thanks to release times.. Paragon can DIAF and so can that faggot Athene. Who didn't earn that 85, he had people power level him.. Nice earnings their pal.<br />
<br />
You have a solution to determine who was in beta and who wasn't? From your point of view people should go not prepared. But it is sport to get to the TOP. Just like football teams does a lot of training, planing and learning before going to World Championship, those people do theyr training.<br />
<br />
And by the way, everyone is able to join them. For example Экзорсус requires only to have mic, logs to demonstrate you know your class and time (and that means: WoW &gt; real world job).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZeroWashu</div><div class="date">2010-12-13, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering that WoW is a game from 2004 with some major and minor engine revamps, those cards should be able to push 600fps if so desired, but sadly Blizzard will not put the stress on the GPU but rather occupy the CPU. Granted it would probably need a seriously major render engine overhaul, but then again, it would be about time, considering the game is updated regularly, why not also update the now really old render engine as a whole, not just adding modern features once every expansion.<br />
<br />
I have to agree, it does not stress GPUs all that much, case in point, I run at 2560x1440 using a 512mb 4850 in an iMac. I do just fine, rarely dipping below 30fps unless it is just insane spell graphics and the like, most areas I am capped by refresh (I guess I could remove the synch and see how high it goes). What allows this to work is a quad core i5 (2.66) and 8gb of memory. Even under Windows7 its pretty good.<br />
<br />
The memory comes in great when I dual box on the same machine. Usually run one session at 1920x1200 and the other at 800x600. The 8x6 has all graphics options off as well as sound, but the 19x12 window is normal. Don't notice any graphic slow down again, so its mostly processor based issues with WOW (at least on the Mac)</div></div><hr />
