There is a good reason for that - you are part of a small (but vocal) minority that has that &quot;problem.&quot; In other words, it is a &quot;problem&quot; that the devs don't believe is in fact a problem...which seems to be true as I only see a portion of HC raiders complaining about it - usually (not always...)the types that like to get &quot;BiS&quot; and then AFK the rest of a tier on top of a Mailbox in the major hub of the expansion trying to showoff their gear to make them feel relevant/superior than everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Never said it's a problem for me, but I do know quite a lot of people who want to feel &quot;done&quot; for once. In Legion every second you're not farming is wasted time and potential lost loot. This devaluates people playing Alts properly since any time wasted on your Alt is time you couldn't make your Main stronger.<br />
Thanks for the answer though.</div></div><hr />

I do agree with that - it does take away time from alts. But their reasoning for TF to exist are sound - an unpleasant side effect for some people is they technically are never &quot;done&quot; which despite my previous response I do sympathize as I love playing alts too.... I just get my gear &quot;good enough&quot; - upgrades are just nice when they happen. I am glad that a few slots can not Titanforge as there *should* be some sort of difference between a LFR/Normal/Heroic/Mythic raider (though personally the fancier looking Mythic gear would be enough difference for me if I cared to raid Mythic.)</div></div><hr />

It is more story driven than grinding driven.<br />
<br />
<br />
This doesn't make any sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
If you want it to be story driven rather than grinding driven, why is randomly grinding out the previous expansion's factions to exalted -- which takes over a week, and cannot really be rushed even then -- a requirement?<br />
<br />
I don't personally have an issue with it, as getting exalted is not terribly difficult, but this statement just feels totally backwards.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Spec restricted transmog for artifacts is disappointing. I wanted to use Apocalypse with my Blood DK.<br />
Let's be honest though, did you really think they were going to allow that? The artifacts were all connected to different specs, so it's only natural that they are bound to them.<br />
<br />
The only one I would have issues with, if it all, are demon hunters ... simply because there are barely any glaives in the game as it is, and the vengeance demon hunters in particular didn't even use traditional glaives as their artifact. But it is what it is, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Because Darkspear and Zandalari troll druid forms will work fine to suit their fantasy with the tusks and the minor added flavor of travel form raptor to distinguish them apart aside from when they're not shapeshifted at all. Dinomancer fantasy will have to a while still :(<br />
Aside from that I'd be fine with the boomkin form being the only one getting updated and upgraded in BfA. Looks like they're not touching it this time either smh.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, if they keep adding classes, it's a lot of work for not much.. considering artwork is the bottleneck in development, not sure it's such a bad thing.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume you will get one set per xpac now, instead of 3, and will be link to challenge stuff like the Mage Tower or MOP Challenge Modes, but not one with every raid tier.</div></div><hr />

Warlock and mages look the same and Priest will look the same too? That is so stupid. Just remove Sets overall and lets all wear ONE armor for every type.

In MoP we saw them turn into Direhorns on the Isle of Giants.<br />

Something is impossible until it happens. It not happening before is not an argument for it not happening at all.<br />

How you compare the azurite gear bonuses to AP is beyond me... it is far more comparable to the Artifact Traits, Legendaries, and Tier Bonuses that it is replacing. And thankfully so!<br />

Sets are not always 100% the best, plenty of times over the course have sets been so useless that people don't use a 4p, sometimes even a 2p.<br />

And it's all in balancing, yes. Trinkets were wonky in the beginning, now though, raids give the best.<br />

no, you just have reading problems. set bonuses were good because the only option was to use them or not. The new traits will have to compete with non raid verisions. Its like taking all the traits in your artifact and spreading them out, locking 1 behind a raid. The chance of the raid one being the best, with blizzards known balancing abilities, is low. You can reference trinkets, talent rows, and legiondaries for this. There WILL be a BiS set up, if it doesnt come from the raid, then it doesnt fill what set bonuses did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They are not trying to &quot;balance&quot; the traits to try and make them equal. They are going to make the raid traits CLEARLY better. That is not a hard thing to do.<br />
<br />
You are also ignoring the fact that it is guaranteed to be BiS item level from raids because they dont titanforge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'll need to be very powerful to ensure guilds go to the effort of putting raids together and keep people turning up, because it's much easier to grind mythic +<br />
<br />
Smaller groups, shorter runs, and you can repeat them just by finding people with keys.<br />
<br />
As to titanforging, they'll never get rid of it because it's an incredibly cheap carrot to keep numbers of hours played up without actually doing anything at all. As is mythic + really, all they do is crank up the difficulty dial on what are otherwise absolutely unchanged dungeons.<br />
<br />
I don;t go with abandoning tier sets either. Tier sets were always a visible trophy with a power reward that told everyone &quot;yeah, I've done raids&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact that you can cobble together tier sets using LFR is a lame excuse and it wouldn't be viable at all without, yep, titanforging. Th eobvious answer is to increase th epower levels of tier sets based on raid difficulty and remove them from LFR. But that conflicts with the &quot;everyone should be able to get a pass&quot; philosophy that is designed to retain subs by telling casuals they can have darn near everything in the game.<br />
<br />
There's a bit of a &quot;we honestly don't like people having to grind dead content&quot; in a game that is designed to encourage that going on here. I mean jeez, these were the devs who just brought in that dumbass thing where you can wear 4+2 mixed tier sets to get three bonuses even though it was blindingly obvious that it would encourage people to grind dead raids for titanforged tier pieces (which was the whole idea, of course - mor ehour splayed for zero outlay) as well as introducing a whole heap of new class balanc eissues since tier armour very often has a strong 2 bonus counterbalanced with a shitty 4 bonus (or vice versa).</div></div><hr />

The real question though is what quality will the sets be if they create more? Is it just going to be a dozen shitty leveling plate sets? or will they be tier quality artwork?

The point he's making is that unless the traits compete with mythic+ available ones, there's less incentive to raid because mythic+ pieces will be much easier to obtain; dungeons are so much smaller and faster to run through, you only need a grou pof five, and you can endlessly repeat them so long as you can find someone with a key, which is exactly what guilds will do, they will just swap out keyholders and rerun the same + until the desired item drops.<br />
<br />
Moreover, given the way M+ operates, it's hard to see how they are going to avoid high key levels competing with raid items, unless they apply special rules to Azerite items. I'm talkign about base ilevel here. Mythic 10 drops ilevel 915...and so does heroic sargeras.<br />
<br />
And mythic 10 was a damn sight easier than heroic sargeras was, to start out. The most powerful and unqiue gear items were....tier sets. Becaus eof the set bonuses.</div></div><hr />

It just sucks that classes are not seperated by one of each other and all will look the same based on armor type... so a DK looks like a Pala and vica versa? Wtf... that is just wrong. Warlock and mages look the same and Priest will look the same too? That is so stupid. Just remove Sets overall and lets all wear ONE armor for every type.

<br />
&quot;They really prune everything right. Now TierSets.&quot; What Ion was saying is that they will be outputting the same amount of armor sets, but the theme won't be tied to classes specifically. He mentioned the fact that all of the gear in Emerald Nightmare were just recolors of the tier pieces that would drop in Nighthold. With this new approach, it would be similar to if Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor and Nighthold had their own (Raid Tier Quality) armor sets that weren't tied to specific classes.

What? That was not what he said, he was asked if there will be ONE set for every armory type, and he said yes. That means, one set for cloth, one for plate etc. therfor that would mean, they will look the same for their particular armory type. And that is horrible</div></div><hr />

No that is not what is stated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
•There will be one appearance per armor type per zone, but more variety across zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4 total armor sets for 1 raid (cloth, leather, mail, plate). No idea WTF they he's referring to when stating &quot;more variety across zones&quot;. I mean the sets already look different between current raid tiers, so no change there.<br />

Only things that bug me about this are his comments about the Argus trinket and how to unlock Nightborne. Both of my characters that are Exalted with the Nightborne are Alliance. Does this mean I have to do that grind/play through that long-ass questline on a Horde character too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. One armor set for each raid. That is why he mentioned the fact that EN had recolors of NH sets. In BfA, that won't be the case. He specifically said that since they aren't making tier sets for every class, they are able to use those extra art resources for different armor sets for each environment.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
No that is not what is stated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4 total armor sets for 1 raid (cloth, leather, mail, plate). No idea WTF they he's referring to when stating &quot;more variety across zones&quot;. I mean the sets already look different between current raid tiers, so no change there.<br />
<br />
Honestly this change seems like a major cop out and will be very lame. Classes will not be distinguishable.<br />
<br />
4 armor sets for one raid, yes. Not one tier. We already know for a fact that there is a troll raid and Azshara raid in the first &quot;tier.&quot; There could also be a Trial of Valor type raid as well, but we don't know. What we do know is that they intend to have different sets for different environments. But raids have multiple environment types. Ion talked about the first raid of BfA being Troll/Titan/Old God based and is the Emerald Nightmare of the tier (small), where the second raid will be High Elf/Naga based and being comparable to Nighthold (larger). It isn't impossible that there could be more than one set for each armor type in the Azshara raid, making a minimum of 3 armor sets for each type.<br />
<br />
The last bit there was more speculation, but Ion did acknowledge the fact that without making armor sets for each different class, that frees up there art resources to work on other armor types. So they aren't just making less armor overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. This is retarded in my opinion. <br />
<br />
I'm all for weapons staying class specific, but why the hell shouldn't a paladin who worked their arses off in legion be able to move forward and and transmog the ashrbinger on to a 2h healing mace or the artifact 2h mace to their ret spec? <br />
<br />
Same goes with pretty much any casters with staffs. Does it really make a difference if an affliction warlock transmog the destro staff?<br />
<br />
<br />
Total character slots per account will not be increased from 50.<br />
<br />
This also seems silly to me. How long have we had 50 character limits? If you're going to open up another 6 slots for allied races (and bring in more allied races in future) to me it would make sense to increase character slots.<br />
<br />
And before I get bashed! I have 26 characters which I've invested time in, some are level 60, 70, 80, 85, 90 twinks, while others are leveling in progress, some are old mains on another server etc. No they aren't all active, but they are all character I've invested time in with a purpose. I also have another 12 characters which I use for for things like guild competitions or socials like scavenger hunts. <br />
<br />
Then add the rest of my characters in (granted they are lowbies which I wouldn't mind deleting) my total count comes up to 46 characters. Now, my play time is restricted and so far in legion I've focused on a handful of characters, but if I can hit 38 upwards characters as side projects here and there over 11 years, then you can bet theres a fuck ton more players out there who have hit the cap and hit the cap with characters they've invested time in. <br />
<br />
This no change won't effect me personally at the end of the day, but tbh it should be increased.</div></div><hr />

Well, the light likes to corrupt everything it touches, so why not make the set have tentacles surrounding it, but instead of all slimy and gross, they are light infused and dripping bright shiny holy goo, so the paladin's armor would be holy tentacles wrapped around the armor and constantly moving.<br />

No matter the raid size, 10-400, when it comes to world first there will always be class stacking, the issue lies in when you get past world 100 and it's still going on.</div></div><hr />

No, they said they will be doing the same number of armor sets overall, potentially even more, but that they won't be class-themed.<br />
<br />
They said there will be a tier quality set for each armor type for each zone/raid tier, plus separate faction-themed sets for PVP and Warfronts.<br />
<br />
They specifically cited the following themed sets for each armor type: Zandalari, Kul Tiran, Titan, Horde, Alliance, and naga/highborne.<br />

A set for every Zone and Raid. Sounds good to me, since generally you get 1-2 sets for each armour class then only &quot;class&quot; sets. Will be nice to have Multiple different plate sets etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The plan is to go back to weapon drops. Compared to the old days, there are so many more sources of loot, so it isn't as hard as it used to be to get a weapon.<br />
<br />
I think its a mistake to be this restrictive. Holy paladins can't transmog their two-handed hammer over the more traditional sword and shield that they've used for so many years, but perhaps they'd enjoy the option to use the Holy artifact skin as Ret? What is so wrong with that?<br />
<br />
Would it be so horrible to allow a BM hunter use the MM artifact skin? Perhaps an Arms warrior would like to transmog his weapon using the Fury skin? Why not?<br />
<br />
Would it open Pandora's box to let me transmog the Scythe of Elune as Resto on my druid? Would that break the game?<br />
<br />
Your job as developers is to make an expansion that sounds fun and exciting. Allowing Arcane mages to use the Frost mage staff for transmog is a small thing that people would be excited for.</div></div><hr />

Yes. I play 50 characters with some frequency. I have a variety of RP characters with established backstories on RP servers, I play challenge series on PVP servers (like leveling an alt on a critically unbalanced server as a very rare race/class for the underdog), I have a few achievement characters who have done something insane in the game (I skipped outland pre-cata twice by doing ONLY pre-60 quest chains, once on alliance, once on Horde), I have Ironman characters. And I have two full servers of &quot;main alts&quot;, one horde, one alliance, that I literally roll a d10 and see which one I play that day.<br />

50 isn't enough. Thanks. It'll never be enough. And I hate that I end up having to delete characters I've enjoyed playing (and would play again!) simply because if I come up with a new RP character, I have to sacrifice someone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Azerite system does not lock you into pieces like tier. Tier locks in pieces because the bonus is based on having multiple pieces of that set equipped. The bonuses for the Helm/Shoulders/Chest pieces are a part of each individual piece. If you have a heroic raid quality shoulder/helm/chest and then you get a mythic raid quality shoulder from your weekly mythic+ chest, you can equip those shoulders and you still keep the traits that you already had from your currently equipped helm and chest piece. You only lose the traits you had for your old shoulders and gain the new traits from your new shoulder piece. There is no penalty from replacing an Azerite piece from a raid with a non-raid Azerite piece other than losing it's unique traits for different ones.<br />

Not necessarily I'm just saying that quantity isn't the same as quality, and simply stating &quot;there will be more&quot; doesn't mean that it's a better system. I'd also like to add that I love class themed sets so anything that isn't that even if it's impeccable will be of lesser quality in my personal opinion</div></div><hr />

Only if you think about it that way, really you only need enough to get into what you want (IE if you want to get into mythic raid) you really don't need to get BiS+ titan forged + socketed on every piece. You can be fine with just getting to x ilvl and doing mythic.<br />
and having a few pieces TF wouldn't hurt that<br />

Except they said they will be putting the love of class sets into the raid and dungeon sets, so more like 200 varieties of pizza.<br />
That being said class sets are not in this xpac, but we are getting diverse armor sets in each raid tier also probably from each dungeon as well.

<br />
Yes. I play 50 characters with some frequency. I have a variety of RP characters with established backstories on RP servers, I play challenge series on PVP servers (like leveling an alt on a critically unbalanced server as a very rare race/class for the underdog), I have a few achievement characters who have done something insane in the game (I skipped outland pre-cata twice by doing ONLY pre-60 quest chains, once on alliance, once on Horde), I have Ironman characters. And I have two full servers of &quot;main alts&quot;, one horde, one alliance, that I literally roll a d10 and see which one I play that day.<br />
<br />
50 isn't enough. Thanks. It'll never be enough. And I hate that I end up having to delete characters I've enjoyed playing (and would play again!) simply because if I come up with a new RP character, I have to sacrifice someone else.<br />
<br />
Wish I had the patience for 50 active characters. I barely keep up with the 13 (12H/1A) I have now.<br />

the problem is not with people using 50 toons consistently - the problem is with people who play this game for over a decade and dont want to delete toons they leveled over the years . <br />
<br />
its really not that shocking - have over 40 toons myself and with pre legion event it took only couple of hours to get them up to level 100. thats why i have now all old alts on that level whhile previously they all were on various stages between 20-90</div></div><hr />

1. You don't know that yet<br />
2. Think about it: If there is only 1 plate set, that means that there are going to be 4 sets per raid. Compare that to the 12 sets they used to do before.<br />
8 Sets must be a lot of work, especially when I consider their overall quality since legion.<br />
Also consider that the team no longer needs to design artifact weapons, and they only need to do one 2-h axe per raid instead of creating multiple 2-h axes for one simple specc.<br />
That would be 8 less sets and a hell of a lot less weapons to do. Do you seriously think Blizzard will just drop all these items and give everyone on the art team longer vacation times?<br />
<br />
No they will most certainly use these resources somewhere else, by either spending much more time for every single design, or implement more stuff in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm all for weapons staying class specific, but why the hell shouldn't a paladin who worked their arses off in legion be able to move forward and and transmog the ashrbinger on to a 2h healing mace or the artifact 2h mace to their ret spec? <br />
<br />
Same goes with pretty much any casters with staffs. Does it really make a difference if an affliction warlock transmog the destro staff?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This also seems silly to me. How long have we had 50 character limits? If you're going to open up another 6 slots for allied races (and bring in more allied races in future) to me it would make sense to increase character slots.<br />
<br />
And before I get bashed! I have 26 characters which I've invested time in, some are level 60, 70, 80, 85, 90 twinks, while others are leveling in progress, some are old mains on another server etc. No they aren't all active, but they are all character I've invested time in with a purpose. I also have another 12 characters which I use for for things like guild competitions or socials like scavenger hunts. <br />
<br />
Then add the rest of my characters in (granted they are lowbies which I wouldn't mind deleting) my total count comes up to 46 characters. Now, my play time is restricted and so far in legion I've focused on a handful of characters, but if I can hit 38 upwards characters as side projects here and there over 11 years, then you can bet theres a fuck ton more players out there who have hit the cap and hit the cap with characters they've invested time in. <br />
<br />
This no change won't effect me personally at the end of the day, but tbh it should be increased.<br />
<br />
Well, I currently play 12 characters actively - 1 of each class - to collect class-specific things like artifact HS and challenge mode skins (done with class campaigns and mounts for some time already). I have 6 of RP and profession alts, which sit at 110 and don't do much except some WQs now and then and world bosses, with 4 in the range between 100 and 110 (will probably get to 110 by the end of the year). This is all Horde side. Then I have a dozen of Alliance characters at 100 which also will be leveled to 110, and one (my old Alliance main) will farm reputation in Argus to get access to the new Allied races in BfA. Then I have 5 characters between 60 and 100 to level (H&amp;A) which I want to keep and level for various reasons, and about 10 level 1 alts which will be mostly sacrificed to get the new races (except that one draenei shaman I did not get to level yet and which cannot be remodeled as a LF draenei since these will not get shamans). <br />
<br />
So, I have wiggle space of 10 characters left, which will be enough for now, though I am not happy about deleting characters at all except some RP projects which are totally done. If they keep expanding on the Allied Races theme though, then I will surely need more than 50 characters on my account.</div></div><hr />

If you want it to be story driven rather than grinding driven, why is randomly grinding out the previous expansion's factions to exalted -- which takes over a week, and cannot really be rushed even then -- a requirement?<br />
<br />
I don't personally have an issue with it, as getting exalted is not terribly difficult, but this statement just feels totally backwards.<br />

That is not a game systems issue Blizzard can fix. That is a very specific personal issue you have that has some deeply seeded psychological deviations. There may be 5 people in the world who approach the game in that way and sacrificing talent and programming hours to satisfy this illusion of you enjoying over 50 chars - which I am going to guess it’s bullshit, since I doubt you even know the names for a third of them - seems like a colossal waste. <br />

He mentioned the fact that all of the gear in Emerald Nightmare were just recolors of the tier pieces that would drop in Nighthold. With this new approach, it would be similar to if Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor and Nighthold had their own (Raid Tier Quality) armor sets that weren't tied to specific classes. In that instance, there would still be multiple armor sets per Armor Type, but they wouldn't be themed around a specific class.<br />
<br />
I don't know where you read about there being multiple sets per armor type because everything I read days there will be 1 set per zone, per armor type. Meaning when the raid drops it will be like WoD LFR, which no one liked.</div></div><hr />

No, you are wrong. This is not a &quot;deviation&quot;. This is working as intended for an RPG game with such a long lifetime. Just because some people are not into the RPG element and see one character or a handful as sufficient, it does not mean that this is the norm. In an RPG, you have players - which corresponds to people with one or few characters - and you have gamemasters - which develop the plot and have many characters - and this corresponds to people with many characters.<br />
<br />
Example: I am a guild master on an RP server with a RP guild of a specific concept. Every player there has a bunch of alts, and I have many characters to fill up the rooster of different positions in the guild. Since we have a very specific concept, and I view my characters to some degree as NPCs regarding the guild RP, to keep the tone of the setting on the spot of the guild concept, I need many character slots to achieve this. RP is also a reason why I have multiple characters of the same class in my guild. An undead priest is per definition a different breed than an BE priest or a Troll priest or a Tauren priest in the RP context. Sometime, gender also makes a difference. When you also take specs into account... you get a vast potential for variety on a single server / account. <br />
<br />
Edit: I also play since the end of 2005, so I have a bunch of characters which are really old and have a high level and which I don't want to delete. And I already have deleted many characters which I really did not want to use anymore. Another characters got a gender or race change so I could play a different RP concept without losing character progress. But when you finally settle on one characer, then you will eventually run out of slots if you play this game as an RPG over such a long time.<br />
<br />
We are already limited by the number of characters per server. And I see actually no problems in increasing the overall level regarding the logistics side of it. If there are not many people who are actually limited by 50 characters per account, and the system can detect that about 40 of these characters hit max level and others are in the leveling process, then they probably could unlock additional slots. Only few people will hit the limit, anyway, and I don't think that goldseller / bot accounts will profit much of the increase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part of the problem with the character cap system is that it is derived from a game much different a decade ago than what we play today. Your RP concept of playing many roles did/does not fit with the pre BC model because back then leveling was an unbelievable grind, so having more than one character was rare (raiders with 2 max level characters was considered an achievement). You would have to gear and maintain them, something that was also a monumental task. Furthermore, the developers took very seriously that your character was your persona, and they frowned upon switching too much. This has been documented in interviews, and it manifested in things such as how hard it was to change specs and how few RP servers existed. Lastly, there is also many technical aspects to account sizes. Not only does it provide some level of security against bots, but it also keeps the data on the servers to a certain size - remember, file sizes on average were many, many times smaller a decade ago than what they are today.<br />
<br />
With all that said, the game has evolved a lot since then. Leveling is easier, gearing is easier, respecing is easier, and games in general are built with stronger engines on much larger servers. Asking for the cap on the number of characters to be increased would probably be more easily doable now and fit with some of the mechanics of the game, but I think what stops the increase is the philosophy of the developers. They still believe that your character is your persona (less so than a decade ago), and try to encourage you to play that character over others to some degree. Put simply, your way of playing the game does not align well with the intended goals of the developers.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I am not trying to belittle how you and your friends enjoy themselves, but you must understand that the game designers have an emotional attachment to their game and want it played in a certain way. If someone with a spoon is trying to cut a loaf of bread, the spoon-maker will shake his head in disappointment. You are free to keep trying with the spoon, but you also can't make the spoon-maker change his wears to fit your needs. What you need then is to either learn how to use a spoon or go find a bread knife/a different game - hold up! Before you virtue signal me to death, what I suggest you need to do next is what pre BC players did. You need to prove that a very large community of people want something, enough so that blizzard is convinced to act. However, based on the developers data of over a decade, that level of demand will never exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;How should RP servers be played on then?&quot; a very vague and hard question with no good answer. I personally would say that they were intended to be played like the other servers, but you RP as you go through the game. Instead of discussing how to min max your dps as you focus down the dragon, you tell your men to circle the beast as you put your life on the line to stop its breath from reaching them. You play the game as Blizzard being the DM and you are one of the players playing their campaign. You don't sit there with 50 character sheets pretending to be different people during the campaign, you have 49 friends who play with you, listening to the DM named Blizzard. Its just my opinion, nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoceb1073a651</div><div class="date">2017-11-17, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the problem with the character cap system is that it is derived from a game much different a decade ago than what we play today. Your RP concept of playing many roles did/does not fit with the pre BC model because back then leveling was an unbelievable grind, so having more than one character was rare (raiders with 2 max level characters was considered an achievement). You would have to gear and maintain them, something that was also a monumental task. Furthermore, the developers took very seriously that your character was your persona, and they frowned upon switching too much. This has been documented in interviews, and it manifested in things such as how hard it was to change specs and how few RP servers existed. Lastly, there is also many technical aspects to account sizes. Not only does it provide some level of security against bots, but it also keeps the data on the servers to a certain size - remember, file sizes on average were many, many times smaller a decade ago than what they are today.<br />
<br />
With all that said, the game has evolved a lot since then. Leveling is easier, gearing is easier, respecing is easier, and games in general are built with stronger engines on much larger servers. Asking for the cap on the number of characters to be increased would probably be more easily doable now and fit with some of the mechanics of the game, but I think what stops the increase is the philosophy of the developers. They still believe that your character is your persona (less so than a decade ago), and try to encourage you to play that character over others to some degree. Put simply, your way of playing the game does not align well with the intended goals of the developers.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I am not trying to belittle how you and your friends enjoy themselves, but you must understand that the game designers have an emotional attachment to their game and want it played in a certain way. If someone with a spoon is trying to cut a loaf of bread, the spoon-maker will shake his head in disappointment. You are free to keep trying with the spoon, but you also can't make the spoon-maker change his wears to fit your needs. What you need then is to either learn how to use a spoon or go find a bread knife/a different game - hold up! Before you virtue signal me to death, what I suggest you need to do next is what pre BC players did. You need to prove that a very large community of people want something, enough so that blizzard is convinced to act. However, based on the developers data of over a decade, that level of demand will never exist.<br />

OK you're right. In Classic, I only had 2 max level characters (mage and rogue), of which only one was raiding (my mage in MC, ZG, AQ20). But I also had a bunch of characters in the range of 20-60 which I also heavily used for RP beside questing and dungeons (holy priest, resto druid, holy paladin, BM hunter, affli warlock, for some time also a disc priest), Alliance only (had some Horde alts but they did not get far). Then, in TBC I had 3 Alliance max level characters (still only 1 raiding, others did WQs and heroics), and then I switched to Horde with a new mage main, followed by a rogue, then druid and priest, warlock, warrior etc. At the same time, I also played Alliance now and then, added some Draenei characters there. Wrath got me some more Horde characters, especially a DK and Paladin at max level and occasionally raiding, just like raiding mage (main) and disc priest. In Cata, I also made a Goblin and a Worgen character. MoP added some monks / a panda. WoD had not that much content for me, so I found myself with 32 level 100 characters transitioning to Legion, including a bunch of DH characters on H/A and different servers (three cheers for heirlooms).<br />
<br />
Long story short: Each addon added some more of characters to my account. Leveling from last max level to new max level is relatively easy, and while I don't play these characters in high end content (which is not my focus anymore), I do have them, and I would like to keep them. I could probably racechange some, but I don't know if this would fit in the case of Allied Races, especially if you need to level at least one character to get the transmog armour set. For RP purposes, you don't need to be decked out in BIS items, technically max level is enough to be able to transmog most things, and to get to all places. Though my most important characters are at item level 900 and up to 936 on my main (again, without any organised raid content and almost no mythic+ activity). The rest got Argus 880 gear tokens and a favorite transmog and is &quot;done&quot; for RP purposes.<br />
<br />
Anecdotal thing: Back in Classic, I was part of an RP raid which met weekly in Zul Gurub. We never got far, usually only the couple of the first bosses, but it was awesome. Unfortunately, I don't have time for such an extensive activity anymore, so I focus on RP with my guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely just as it was in WoD, still get the (titanforged) BiS weapon or &quot;bad&quot; weapons problem.<br />
<br />
i.e : How many sources or options like m+ is quite irrelevant when the weekly loot pinata &quot;BiS&quot; arcanocrystal exist.<br />
<br />
For melee(and hunters) weapons has always been very important upgrade for character progress.<br />

<br />
I work 50 hours a week and other commitments that prevent me from being able to raid, even though I'm skilled enough on an individual and leadership level.<br />

I play DPS and Prot warrior. In the past there was *no way* I would invited to higher level 5-man content (or even some heroic PUGs) with any degree of consistency while DPS spec due to my iLVL being too low.<br />

Now, due to M+ (loot + chest) and TF I am *so much closer* to those guys that raid Mythic and I'm actually able to compete. Guess what, I smash 99% of them in this environment. <br />

So the argument that &quot;casuals do not deserve this gear&quot; is a fallacy. There are plenty of deserving players who cannot commit the time to an organized raid who deserve loot equal to their ability. M+ and TF provide that opportunity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't you do the same thing right now with relics? Right now, each class has some BiS relics that they farm and hope to TF. All that re-introducing weapon drops is changing that from going after 3 BiS items and hope them to tf to going after 1, doesn't it? The traits on relics can easily be compared to the stat distribution on a weapon, if you just look at how they are classified (trait X being equivalent to an ilvl increase of Y, which we had similarly before).<br />
<br />
However, when you think back at older expansions, it was often hard to get any weapon in a new raid tier. I remember farming ICC over and over on my feral tank to get a good two hand weapon, which were rather rare on the agility side of things. But if I had had mythic plus options etc back then, it would have been much easier. That's what Ion meant there.<br />
Min-Maxers will always find a BiS item and farm that for TF, that is inherent to the TF system. Doesn't change much whether you farm weapons or relics.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dembai</div><div class="date">2017-11-18, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is not a game systems issue Blizzard can fix. That is a very specific personal issue you have that has some deeply seeded psychological deviations. There may be 5 people in the world who approach the game in that way and sacrificing talent and programming hours to satisfy this illusion of you enjoying over 50 chars - which I am going to guess it’s bullshit, since I doubt you even know the names for a third of them - seems like a colossal waste. <br />
<br />
I’d sooner bellieve you just randomly kept making chars up to the cap and they became a problem to delete them cause you need to empty their mailbox.<br />
<br />
Okay, I'll bite. Servers are down, so let's see how many I remember.<br />
<br />
Horde server:<br />
<br />
Dembai, Dembones, Satyran, Hailxenu, Freespirit, Klitzkrieg, Grimalkin, Winespritzer, Yatokya, Suntap, Spriggit,<br />
<br />
Alliance server:<br />
<br />
Dembai, Feizui, Turbokillah, Braidstorm, Bubblehooves, Wazzat, Frostagg, Nakedbankelf, Thicclock, Demblitz, Jestarr <br />
<br />
Leveled to 68 without going to outland, pre-cata quests only, no PVP, no grinding:<br />
<br />
Alliance: Stagg<br />
Horde: Creepycow<br />
<br />
Other Challenge characters:<br />
<br />
Cowgoesmoo - druid only wearing the full pre-cata WC set, no deaths, only got him to 40 so far, but I have to be super careful.<br />
Rarestspawn - Dwarf Warlock, always wears silver, has silver hair, put on a PVP server massively unbalanced towards the horde.<br />
Corpsesafari - Undead hunter, aims to get every undead-looking pet, no-hierlooms chalenge.<br />
Datfatowl - Troll Druid leveling as a moonkin, hadn't come up with a challenge for her yet.<br />
<br />
Corpse runners - a set of 10 characters that when I would die (due to PVP), I'd play the next one in order, and naturally they all had funny names about being dead or would be funny to find, like &quot;Probablydead&quot; and &quot;Hordeinside&quot; and &quot;Femaledwarf&quot; and &quot;Sorryabouthat&quot; and &quot;Handlebars&quot;...<br />
<br />
RP characters:<br />
<br />
Wrendis - Bar-frequenting old lady who talks crap.<br />
Rethistraza - red dragon who has lost most of her magic. <br />
Llew - Pally leveled with my husband (also a pally).<br />
Piano - Priest leveled with my husband (who was a warrior)<br />
Wazzat - (a different one) a draenei warrior with PTSD.<br />
Dembe - a nelf from an alternate timeline where the Dark Elves never became Trolls, another tribe did instead.<br />
<br />
Remembrance character:<br />
<br />
Englishmajor - for my brother who passed away.<br />
<br />
<br />
So...that's 40. Of 50.<br />
<br />
If I gave it more time, I'd probably remember more. So yeah. <br />
<br />
I think there's more than 5 people in the world who are capped out and unhappy that we can't play more characters. I know it's weird to you, but I like having a depth of experiences, and even when I'm not actively typing out a roleplay, I do always roleplay in my head as my characters go through these things. <br />
<br />
My only annoyance is when I come up with a new idea, and I can't even play it - because as much fun as it would be to make a character who would just farm ONE set of gear, simply to look awesome in it, I have to give up on a character who has a history for me. And that's NOT fun.</div></div><hr />

People have gotten riled up about this before, and Blizzard corrected them saying the same thing. Don't ask me to provide context or sources for this, as I am not going to look up something as vague as this through years of posts. The point is, this has been done before and got the same response, so expecting it to suddenly change is foolish. Hoping it will is another story entirely, though.<br />
<br />
One way or another, what's done is done. I do hope Blizzard reconsiders class sets, as that class aesthetic is what personally excites me about raid sets. Without it, it's just random crap in raids that I care nothing about. This screams laziness to me; Blizzard can surely do better. But, if they choose not to, that's their choice. I dislike their choice, but I can live with it; most tier sets are meaningless to me anyways.</div></div><hr />

What if they instead turned down the power gap per ilvl? A 10-20 ilvl difference would mean a 10% damage difference, which would mean high skilled players would be able to narrow the gap even further. Today, your skill in playing affects the ability to perform a lot less due to the power level of gear. I personally think that doing the same amount of damage as a whole raid only 2 tiers ago (in the same expansion) is insane. (EN vs ToS)</div></div><hr />

At the very least then they should try to make Direhorn for guardian form. For feral they could use jaguar form and it would still somehow fit. <br />
They could use already existing model and animations, just rename few skills (but add original name in the bracket) and it would somehow work. <br />

Depends which you mean, I actually like half of them. Zandalari, Highmountain and Dark Iron and I will make for each one I will make a character. But in case of druid class it's more tricky to me. Nothing should be pushed by force, if they can't do something right then they should drop it. really. <br />

Zandalari, Highmountain and Dark Iron and I will make for each one I will make a character. But in case of druid class it's more tricky to me. Nothing should be pushed by force, if they can't do something right then they should drop it. really. <br />

I wanted them to be implemented as unlockable extended customisation options &gt;_&gt;<br />

Well let's see how it works out first. ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therealbowser</div><div class="date">2017-11-18, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the very least then they should try to make Direhorn for guardian form. For feral they could use jaguar form and it would still somehow fit. <br />
They could use already existing model and animations, just rename few skills (but add original name in the bracket) and it would somehow work. <br />
<br />

<br />
But if they refuse to do this little to make this combo believeable then they shouldn't even add this as there was no other support for Zandalari druids.<br />
<br />
Maybe. How do you justify anything other than feral* form zandalari trolls, though? (*meaning, guardian and feral)<br />
<br />
Honestly, Zandalari Druids are a pretty big stretch -- even if they had dino forms somehow, it wouldn't make sense in lore beyond feral forms, really. Why do they have moonkin form? Why do they have space lasers? Why do they have druidic-healing magic?<br />
<br />
My best guess is that they have vague ties to magic similar to druidism (not necessarily dinomancy) and learn proper druidism from their darkspear or tauren friends. Honestly, it's even a bit odd that highmountain tauren can be druids, given that the tauren learned from night elves. I have to assume all of them are being taught.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well moonkin only fits night elves anyway, it can be glyphed out and using nature/ arcane spells could somehow work. For resto you no longer have to be in tree form all the time. <br />
And how to justify it? As usual &quot;Loas give powers&quot;. Troll deities are very diverse and can revard their followers with various powers, especially nature ones as Loas are in the end Wild Gods.<br />
<br />
But personally I really woldn't mind if Zandies didn't have druids at all. I'd rather if devs would redesign Darkspear forms instead (nd give them race specific glyph to morph to direhorn) and give Zandalari paladins class. It could show how both tribes channel Loa powers in different way.</div></div><hr />

I already hate that blue sets right now are this way. They can do sets inspired in the zone AND in class, it doesn't need to be one way. Look at Antorus Hunter set, is huntery and naga, so it would have fit in this expansion, in Azshara's raid. It's not that difficult. The Antorus shaman one is also more suited to the Zandalari raid.</div></div><hr />

No. Just no. Zandalari 'freethinkers' are not paladins. The entire concept was to imply that there are Zandalari that chose to stand for their beliefs instead of participating in traditional zandalari culture. They had some traits of paladins, but not their abilities. More practically, it was an excuse to justify tier gear in Zul'Gurub for paladins. It's no surprise that these 'freethinkers' were never heard of ever again past that point.<br />
<br />
You might as well ask for lightforged draenei warlocks at this point.</div></div><hr />

That is not comparable lol, <br />

Those mobs are harnessing powers of Loa, they're a thing. This is not singular NPC but actual military unit. And it fits this race as they're priest/ scholar society, their city is big temple complex.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mootygrimes</div><div class="date">2017-11-21, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What if they instead turned down the power gap per ilvl? A 10-20 ilvl difference would mean a 10% damage difference, which would mean high skilled players would be able to narrow the gap even further. Today, your skill in playing affects the ability to perform a lot less due to the power level of gear. I personally think that doing the same amount of damage as a whole raid only 2 tiers ago (in the same expansion) is insane. (EN vs ToS)<br />
<br />
That's not really true, though, man. This is because performance is relative.<br />
<br />
Each tier when a new raid goes up you'll go through wclogs and see that the people with 90p+ parses are simply outperforming others. This applies to both the Overall and iLvL rankings.<br />
<br />
So what I'm saying is that if you, today, are parsing 80p and are putting our more damage than an entire Raid Group from two Tiers ago that's well and good, but you are still competing against other players are who seeing those same big TF rolls and as a result your true skill is still being surfaced.<br />
<br />
I think what you're trying to comment on is the number-bloat that the game is seeing (~3 Million Executes? lol), which is a different Problem Statement altogether. One that I completely agree with: I'm totally with you on this, but I think you replied to my post which was meant to speak to the other problem (It's cool, dude!) It's fun to feel like your character is becoming more powerful and can do more stuff, faster just because they are stronger -- that's great feedback from a game!<br />
<br />
The problem I'm having now is that the numbers are (again) getting super wonky. It's to the point where the numbers don't even feel personal any more -- they're just out there in comic book land. This is why the developers are pushing their second item squish into the game to bring these back to readable values. The other, possibly more exciting thing they're doing is iLvL Squish. This will make it so that we're not running around with ilvl 1400 gear by the end of BfA, and is a good chance. <br />
<br />
So, my point: Even in this new system your skill (relative to others) will be visible, and would require an extreme amount of TF luck to be able to change it -- even then, if you're not skilled and are not making the right decisions situationally you're not going to break the highest percentiles.</div></div><hr />

That's the only iteration of a 'troll paladin' I've ever seen or heard of. It's a huge stretch, but at least it has some vague sense of ground to stand on. I still think it would be ridiculous to add it based off of the concept of 'free-thinkers', or this single npc, but it's nice to see at least a case where something indirectly related to the concept of troll paladins actually existed.<br />
<br />
I still am heavily against it, but slightly less than I was previously.</div></div><hr />

Well I would agree with you in regards of freethinkers, as it doesn't even sounds as class. Prelate is another story, I like the idea behind this class, and that it's not like Holy Light Church stuff, but warrior that serves with zeal his religion that is Loa Pantheon and he is there to protect the high priests and carry Loa's will, no matter if it would be seen as good or evil by outsiders. <br />
<br />
I'd love if few spells would be renamed in a way that let's say you have Mark of Loa and in bracers you would have original name. Similar to Heroism in Alliance where the original name was Blood Lust. <br />
<br />
Combine that Zandalari live in golden city temple complex, and they can have mounts covered in gold aswell (like this dino mummy in golden amulets :<br />
<br />

<br />
And with the heritage armor they would look amazing.</div></div><hr />

I will say that if any troll could have something akin to royal knights or paladins, it would be the Zandalari. They have always been and always will be the most advanced and ancient troll culture. Maybe they could have paladins, but it would still be one hell of a stretch. I will admit, though, that this is literally the only class that could feasibly separate Zandalari from trolls (as opposed to Zandalari just having less classes that Darkspear all have access to). Since, you know, Darkspear can be every class except for paladins and demon hunters, and the latter will obviously never be playable on any troll race.<br />
<br />
That doesn't need to be done, though, and isn't being done for Lightforged Draenei, Highmountain Tauren, or presumably Dark Iron (unless Dark Iron suddenly get access to druids or demon hunters, lol). Even Void elves are using the same classes blood elves have access to, minus paladins, death knights, and demon hunters. Only nightborne -- if compared to night elves and not blood elves -- have classes to differentiate themselves.<br />
<br />
In short, I still highly doubt it will ever happen, but I'm not entirely against the concept. I still think it's a poor fit, but not one that would really upset me if it happened. It would still need to be done right, and done convincingly. I will admit that you make the idea sound like it could work, troll paladins aren't a complete joke combination to me like draenei warlocks, undead shaman, dark iron druids, etc now, just a highly unlikely one.</div></div><hr />

Yeah this is why, if troll paladin would be a thing, then it would only fit a Zandalari as they managed to keep their empire in pristine form, other troll tribes had to forsake order and live in riches because of constant strife with other races, and be more into pure survival way of living. This is why I would agree that it wouldn't fit other troll tribes, as they don't even have a means to properly train them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe they could have paladins, but it would still be one hell of a stretch.<br />
I disagree, they have much better background than Sunwalkers, even if I like the concept of Sunwalker, but not really the way they were introduced and how they were handled. Zandalari has much better chance to be done right.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will admit, though, that this is literally the only class that could feasibly separate Zandalari from trolls (as opposed to Zandalari just having less classes that Darkspear all have access to). Yea, I would rather for Zandalari to have paladins than druids, and leave druids to Darkspears to show those two tribes harness power of Loa in different. Darkspears surely also have Shadow Hunters, but I doubt Blizzard would use their potential seeing how they wasted their most prominent one without even having one cinematic that would show what kind of powers they have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since, you know, Darkspear can be every class except for paladins and demon hunters, and the latter will obviously never be playable on any troll race.<br />
Well Zandalari had Demoniacs, that work similar, but truth to be told, I'd rather for trolls to stay away from fel/demon crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, I still highly doubt it will ever happen, but I'm not entirely against the concept. <br />
Well I have my hopes based on leaked mounts. Three default raptors + one with extra tag &quot;Gold&quot;. It made me believe that this will be unique paladin mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
I still think it's a poor fit, but not one that would really upset me if it happened. <br />
I understand that you prefer Paladin to be more human aligned stuff, that when you hear Paladin you think of cathedrals and the Holy Light. But this is also the reason why I couldn't level one past lvl 30 althought I did tried on every alliance race. And to me on the other hand Alliance shamans except pandaren does't feel right at all to me. Neither of them is tribal or primal. Pandaren at least have special bound with elementals and their balance mentality works fine for me. <br />
<br />
<br />
It would still need to be done right, and done convincingly. I will admit that you make the idea sound like it could work, troll paladins aren't a complete joke combination to me like draenei warlocks, undead shaman, dark iron druids, etc now, just a highly unlikely one.<br />
<br />
As I said I would understand your issue if it would be about other troll tribes, but not Zandalari. It really fits their culture, they have a background for it, and with Heritage armor they will look truly outstanding, take some weapons from ToT and + golden raptor and we're at home. Go and fight for the empire, smite down the heathens that defy Loa's will and protect the High Priests.</div></div><hr />

In that case, disgusting idea.They are saying that they will makes sets based on where they come from - based on who we are looting them from - which makes perfect sense. So instead of Warrior, Pally, and DK sets, we would have sets for each instance and each zone.</div></div><hr />
