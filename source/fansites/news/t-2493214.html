No one is immune from death—no one except the people of Mechagon. At least, that’s what the stories say. Most gnomes think Mechagon is just a far-fetched legend, but not the old, scarred explorer Kervo. After years of obsessive research, he has set off on what might be his final adventure: a daring gambit to find Mechagon and uncover the secrets of immortality before his own time runs out.

Poor old fool... he wanted immortality so much that he was willing to leave everything and everyone behind. Then again, maybe he thought it would be worth it, that the change would be welcomed? Now he's just a malfunctioning robot.</div></div><hr />
