<br />
I agree, but the appearance of the word 'often' in the tooltip worries and annoys me in equal measure. I had understood that this glyph would make Dire Beast only summon stabled pets. I don't really want to see random world beasts functioning as my Dire Beasts at all. Would it really have been so hard to make it only summon stabled pets?<br />
<br />
It could be unclear wording, or it could be that the tooltip is wrong, but I really want to see what this glyph actually entails in practice.</div></div><hr />

Every expansion has some nice music and I doubt it will change this time. Even Pandaria with its bit frustrating music at times was still pleasant. There are lots of wishes and &quot;but&quot;s about new expansion but I honestly just want to play it for some fun, explore new places, dungeons, maybe even again go on a raid (thoug guild raiding is long past for me). I don't expect to play Legion more than 2 months and I would be very surprised if Blizzard managed to make Legion so nice that I would play it consistently through a year. <br />
I'm a bit worried about changes to holy paladin class as it seems it wont be as mobile or as strong as in the past but in worst scenario I may fall back on my resto druid or holy priest. Hope they just won't make mistake like in Cataclysm where healers had to MB every fight and were expected to heal up people between fights so nobody else would need to have food and so they would constantly go for new mobs while healer was struggling with mana breaks.</div></div><hr />

well the fun part is it has 2 colors and one of it (Red) is very prominend used for the nightmare . its far reach but my guess is we fight in his mind (dreams) and clense it from the coruption of it after the fight his tatoo color change to the more Arcane looking one.</div></div><hr />

It's not entirely a bad thing, it lets guilds progress to the level they want to. But this really should be implemented on 5 mans, too. Oh, wait, my bad, everything in the game is now focused on raid instances. <br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see how many actually use it, and how far. It could be great, or it could fail spectacularly - depends on the the loot, really, and they're already dangling the carrot...<br />

wow, more shit from diablo<br />
<br />
so interesting<br />
<br />
The Diablo team has done a remarkable job saving the game after He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named left, from a bad game, into a very, very good game. They get the people who play it, care about the game, and have managed to keep it interesting. WoW could definitely borrow a lot from their ideas, and are. <br />
<br />
Again, the Greater Rifts...er, keystones and Mythic + are not necessarily a bad idea. <br />
<br />
And, before anyone starts whining, Diablo 3 isn't perfect, but i didn't claim that, so take your rustled jimmies elsewhere. There's plenty of room for you in that grotesque yet hilarious &quot;vanilla server shut down&quot; thread in General.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this is, in my view, why there are so many red flags: Wilson joined the WoW team for WoD which first introduced randomized stats onto gear (previously only seen in Diablo) and the more Diablo crossovers we get in WoW, the more this feels like Wilson is trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole. WoD has already left a bad taste in many mouths; Legion has to do much better and I'm not really convinced that cribbing from D3 is the best approach.<br />
<br />
At some point if this trend continues the only reason people will play WoW is for the raid content; they'll play D3 for solo/small group stuff.</div></div><hr />

??? This is for 5 men dungeons...which is just pathetic...Normal, hc, mythic, mythic+...same content over and over again..This is World of Diablo now...<br />

<br />
I agree that the D3 team has done a great job with it, RoS is a fuck ton of fun. But things that work for Diablo do not necessarily work for WoW. Greater Rifts? Sure, people love dungeon running and it gives people with less time something challenging to do, high scores for people to shoot for, etc. It doesn't really effect the status quo, just adds to it. <br />
<br />
But randomized gear is pissing annoying, speed, avoidance and leech are pointless. Warforged /kinda/ worked, in that it at least just gave 1 variable. World Legendaries are far too powerful, they're designed like Diablo legendaries, despite the fact that it's a completely different style of game.<br />
<br />
You're right that borrowing ideas from things that do well isn't a bad idea, but you need to consider what is going to actually fit into the world you're transposing it into. Jay Wilson doesn't feel like he's doing some things because he thinks they'll work, just that he sees them doing well in D3 and wants a piece of it because he got the boot, without consideration for WHY it works in D3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't this impossible? I read somewhere that the way the goastlands where designed, they would totally overlap Stratholme, which is the reason why it was not included on the main map in the first place<br />
