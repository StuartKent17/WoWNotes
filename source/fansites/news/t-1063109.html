However, it will now trigger approximately 3 times as often. This is intended to keep overall DPS the same while reducing burst damage, especially in PvP.<br />

Other MMORPG Games<br />
“The real game doesn’t start until you’re max level”.<br />
Before I begin, I should clarify that the following post is composed entirely of my own, personal opinions. I think that games in the MMO genre tend to transform at the level cap, mostly because leveling has ended, which heralds a slight change in basic gameplay.<br />
<br />
In World of Warcraft, many of the same experiences that are available when leveling up remain available at the level cap (questing, exploring new areas), and you also gain access to new experiences and challenges. The motivations and goals tend to be a bit different and less single minded. Rather than pursuing a new level, and the new abilities and talents that can come with it, instead you might be seeking a powerful item, trying to defeat a more powerful enemy in PvE, or achieving a milestone in the PvP game, among many other goals including completing achievements, finishing collections, capping professions, etc. Gameplay broadens, from the relatively simple road of questing and leveling, into a broad plain of possibilities.<br />
<br />
The leveling experience awaits once again with a new character though, and playing a game with a new character class can offer an entirely new gameplay experience, especially if you select a different class role than the one you're already used to. Of course, expansions also offer the opportunity to experience leveling again for end-game characters. Some would say that there's an unfortunate tendency for players to plow through expansions as quickly as possible to pursue end-game again, because they have a pre-conception that &quot;it's the only thing that matters&quot;.<br />
<br />
Honestly, that is what tabletop gaming is for. Players and their game masters (GMs) spend hours creating characters that are unique to the player. And then the GM creates a story that the players follow. But while a (good) GM might have an overall plan for his/her players the path they take is determined by the players not the GM.<br />
I absolutely adore table top gaming, and it's a popular pass time here at Blizzard. <br />
<br />
I believe that a good game master, with the help of a group of players who are willing to invest themselves in the story and their characters, together can create an experience that is truly thrilling, engaging, cathartic and satisfying. Even a not so serious game can be outright hilarious, and I don't think I've ever spent as much time laughing as I have around the gaming table. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215805-are-all-mmorpgs-like-this/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3881721982?page=3#53))<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria: More of a Patch than an Expansion?<br />
Challenge Modes - A progression of achievements, hardly revolutionary.<br />
It’s quite an awesome feature as I see it; after not too long a dungeon becomes too easy or simple because of out-gearing it or a number of other reasons. These challenge modes will allow you to compete on par with other players who have better gear as everyone will have a fixed Ilvl when inside challenge dungeons. <br />
<br />
This means you are all competing for the prestige of being the fastest to complete these dungeons compared to others. <br />
<br />
Pet Battles - No comment<br />
This particular mini-game may not be for everyone, and it’s not designed to be. We want to be sure that there is something in the game that each player can enjoy doing, be it PvP, PvE or even pet battles; pet battles are being implemented to create a fun, new type of activity that all players have access to and offering an alternative to increasing the power and strength of your character specifically.<br />
<br />
New Zones - I always love a new zone, but think it's all a bit stale now. Same models, same textures, same trees, it's just not exciting anymore<br />
Just as it was in BC, WotLK and Cataclysm, the setting is changing. I don’t think that the look and feel of any expansion to date has been like the previous, they have all had a very unique feel, this is true for Mists of Pandaria as well.<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria will be on a continent which is largely based around Asian culture, this differs greatly from any previous expansions. BC was a very demonic setting, WotLK was in a cold and frigid Northland, and Cataclysm was set where the world was beginning to literally falling apart as can be seen in the landscapes. So we assure you that it will be different <br />
<br />
I think the only thing that will make me buy the expac would be no flying in the new zone. It's the only way to bring back PVP, I purposely rolled on a PVP realm for 1 reason, I want to skirmish WHEREVER and WHENEVER I want, not when I queue for a BG, that's what PVE realms are for.<br />
Well, we are taking several initiatives to try and bolster world PvP and bring it back to everyone! For one, we are not allowing flying in Pandaria until level 90. This means that there will be no people suddenly taking off into the skies when you approach them, unless they have reached the max level. We are re-introducing optional world bosses which players will fight each other for. There are also many more initiatives that are being taken so we hope that world PvP will once again be bustling with activity.

It's never been an exploit. Notice how Stars didn't get banned? It did mean the heroic instance was not ready for prime time, so they kicked them out till next week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the 7th week of Dragon Soul. At this point in time you could have killed all normal bosses at most 7 times and heroic bosses at least 6 and any combination in between. Имбос has killed multiple bosses 8 times. Yor'sahj and Ultraxian 9 times each. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has stated multiple times that you are not allowed under any circumstances that you can loot any boss more then once her raid week. He will get banned, they will get removed.</div></div><hr />

When I see logs from EU and any NON-US servers I dismiss them as quick as I see them.<br />
Don't let a single incident from a guy with a name I can't even read effect you and your WoW experience. They have their servers, we have ours.<br />

People did it in ICC for shards for shadowmourne, admitedly i did it once as well to finish it before expansion.. but also mostly because i had to pug most of mine, the quality of runs left on my previous server was diminishing as people were doing more 10man and less 25 man. ITs not an exploit as its been in the system for ages and was happening in ICC.. the same discussion was held then, and nothing got changed. If he can afford to do it and is dedicated enough to do it.. good on him The simple fix is that blizz could just lock raids and not reset them when you faction change, same with server xfer.</div></div><hr />

Имбос has killed multiple bosses 8 times. Yor'sahj and Ultraxian 9 times each. Blizzard has stated multiple times that you are not allowed under any circumstances that you can loot any boss more then once her raid week. He will get banned, they will get removed.<br />

<br />
Well, there's no way this was done legit.<br />
<br />
7 resets account for 56 boss kills. For simplicity's sake, let's say that he got 2 clusters from all bosses (which isn't even close to reality), 112 clusters in total. Now, if those clusters were to hold the average of 6 gems per cluster you'd need 56 clusters for 333 gems, which would leave 56 clusters for phase 3 (not even the legit rogues are close to this).<br />
<br />
The only real possibility for him to have done this legit if he would've gotten an average of 7 gems from each of the clusters, and if he would've gotten an average of 2 clusters per boss from all 56 kills (which I highly doubt since the average drop rate for clusters is 1.8 per boss), which would mean that he would've gotten the daggers with 103 clusters (52 boss kills if all bosses dropped 2 clusters).<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the guy has 9, yes, NINE kills of Ultraxion and Yor'sahj when you combine his normal and heroic kills, although the patch has only been out for 6 weeks (7th reset going now).</div></div><hr />

Yep, makes me sad. 100% of WoW sites ignored the fact that Exorsus exploited server transfer. Hell, i even got banned for simply stating the truth here, @ noob-club.ru and other places.<br />
That helped them to get 8/8, wf glory and now, wf legendary daggers. Actually, when they first exploted this, i predicted that Имбос will get his daggers wf.<br />
<br />
Just count character's boss kills and available lockouts of 4.3 patch.<br />
The same thing as LFR - more than 1 boss loot per week, still no bans or any kind of punishment.<br />
<br />
What a disgrace. Help spreading the word.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc7f082fdd70</div><div class="date">2012-01-13, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be fair, I just don’t get why people keep on talking about the non flying thing in Pandaria, and how it will bring world PvP back. There are several questions I ask myself: 1.	aren’t people not wanting world PvP being forced to participate into something undesirable, each time they go into the world trying to get things done? 2.	People on PvE realms who don’t PvP flag themselves, how do they benefit from such a thing? 3.	people that want to participate in world PvP, would they fly if they had the ability? As for question 1: I play on a PvE realm, and I have no desire whatsoever to engage in PvP. I rarely do PvP as I dislike it. I freak out when I see a dick standing on top of quest givers with their PvP flagged on (and most of the time sitting on a huge mount, blocking your way to getting the quest), in the hope to lure someone into accidentally engaging in PvP. And the worst part of it is that they are opposing faction, and you cannot call them out of their dick behaviour. On PvP server, the matter is totally different, as people chose to be pvp flagged. But on my PvE realm, the only thing I see is having to ride instead of fly. So because some people yelled hard: bring back world PvP, I am forced to ride instead of fly to get to my destination, basically tripling my travel time. (more If I have to take a detour because of mountains/rock/water I cannot cross) As for question 2: I guess the answer to this is: not at all, they triple their riding time. As for question 3: let’s assume I like PvP, but I am in a mood in which I just want to get my things done without too much interference. People on PvP realms that take their flying mount show they do not wish to participate in world pvp, right? Well, since they cannot fly, they are forced to participate. And you can argue: well that is the point of a PvP server. But I think even players on PvP realms have the desire to just pass for the action from time to time. (which is proven by the lack of it during Cata, since players just fly) I think it is amazing how people yell about the flying when they have all the possibilities to not take a flying mount, and ride to their destination instead, while being ‘vulnerable’ to world PvP. And when they ride to their destination, they can attack other people who have the same desire for world PvP as they do, while all those that do not have that desire, can just fly to the destination. So my answer to all those yelling PvP players is: thanks for nothing for making my travel time take 3 times longer and for screwing over my already limited playing time.</div></div><hr />

That and you forgot to mention that this supports level 90 players ganking level 85-89 players, because they have no means of escaping anyone with a mount 3 times as fast as theirs.

The fact is he plays on a NON-US Server. It wasn't a US server so they can keep their Europe, Korea, China, Venus, Narnia achievements.

This is the 7th week of Dragon Soul. At this point in time you could have killed all normal bosses at most 7 times and heroic bosses at least 6 and any combination in between. Имбос has killed multiple bosses 8 times. Yor'sahj and Ultraxian 9 times each. Blizzard has stated multiple times that you are not allowed under any circumstances that you can loot any boss more then once her raid week. He will get banned, they will get removed.<br />
<br />
He won't get banned, and they won't get removed, just like nothing has nor will happen to the guild.<br />
<br />
Blizzards stance on server transferring is that it's perfectly acceptable. Stars got hit because they did it in the first week of release, to start heroics in week 1, that's not intended.<br />
<br />
After week 1 you can server transfer every week and get 2 lockouts legally, in blizzards eyes. Everyone is able to do it if they wish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was this done with the help of an exploit that resets the raid CD when you make a character transfer (I don't know the specifics)?<br />
<br />
Or it's really possible to get the legendary daggers within 5 weeks of farming in a 25 man raid?<br />
<br />
One interesting fact about this guild and the rogue that collected the daggers:<br />
<br />
He apparently sold his character about a month ago for 500$ (~19 000 rubles), then he called Blizzard and recovered it without returning the money. So basically he scammed someone for a nice sum. Not only that, but the guild also invited him back and now they collected the daggers for him.<br />
The guild master knew he was selling the character as he was the one to advertise the deal.<br />
So you can't even trust the &quot;top guild&quot;.<br />
<br />
The hilarious part now it seems that they used this money to make transfers and get double loot per week :)<br />

Yeah this is true!! Actually it is horribly RNG based how many gems and clusters you get. So you can get unlucky and only get 1 cluster per boss and as you´ve mentioned those clusters can also drop a low amount of gems.</div></div><hr />

Flying is one of the best things they could have implemented.

They look fine imho. There's only so much you can do with a pair of tiny daggers. Besides, you still get a nice wing effect.</div></div><hr />

Top 25 Man guilds that have done it legitimately are still 2-3 weeks off completing the fangs. Why would it be &quot;kick in the balls&quot; for for 25s to get them first? Having 1 in 10 man would be more beneficial than having 1 in a 25 man.</div></div><hr />

Yep Methods rogue has stage 2 and still needs 30 more crystals for the legendarys. This means 2-3 more weeks total http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/xavius/Xerofour/simple I saw it yesterday on his life stream he´s 32/60 now</div></div><hr />

<br />
so..basicly your saying that 10m guilds aren't allowed to compeat to a world first even if it happens to be a legendary?<br />
25m is not harder..than 10m, yeh more people, more damage, more health..MORE damage per second from the raiders.<br />

You can’t buy gold because it’s cheating unless you get it by selling in store pets from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
You can’t gain loot from a boss more than 1 per raid lock out through an exploit because it’s cheating unless it’s an exploit that involves paying Blizzard for a faction change.<br />

It's not because of that they made legenaries Harder/longer to get in 10 man. It's because if you made it take the same time to get in both 10 and 25, 25 man guilds would rather set up 2-3 10 man raids to get 3 legendaries within the same time as 10 man, blizzard actually stated this when they released the staff.</div></div><hr />

Was this done with the help of an exploit that resets the raid CD when you make a character transfer (I don't know the specifics)?<br />
<br />
Or it's really possible to get the legendary daggers within 5 weeks of farming in a 25 man raid?<br />
<br />
One interesting fact about this guild and the rogue that collected the daggers:<br />
<br />
He apparently sold his character about a month ago for 500$ (~19 000 rubles), then he called Blizzard and recovered it without returning the money. So basically he scammed someone for a nice sum. Not only that, but the guild also invited him back and now they collected the daggers for him.<br />
The guild master knew he was selling the character as he was the one to advertise the deal.<br />
So you can't even trust the &quot;top guild&quot;.<br />
<br />
The hilarious part now it seems that they used this money to make transfers and get double loot per week :)<br />

You know, the &quot;great and best&quot; world PvP means in 99,99% of all cases, that you get raped by a group of 3 or more a**holes, who think that they are so great just because they have the advantage in numbers. Such bullshit is great PvP? I wish, WoW would get rid of PvP completely and only keep Battlegrounds and Arena for that matter. <br />
<br />
There is no thrill anymore left, it's only annoying, wasting my time.<br />
<br />
Seconded and thirded... And if the ganger is only one character, then he has some great advantage. Like being 5 levels above you and in full PVP gear, or you are on 20% hp fighting group of mobs. World PVP of today is not about fun but about making the opponent's gaming experience as bad as possible. I'd welcome some world PVP fights like Wintergrasp (after main battle) or even good old Tarren Mill fights. Just something which you actively join, where you are the player, not the victim...<br />
<br />
BTW I know in Tarren Mill fights were &quot;victims&quot; who were just leveling in the wrong place... but the focus of players was to fight the enemy's combatants, not hunting lowbies... (at least the normal players)</div></div><hr />

No you can't. It entirely depends who you are playing with.<br />
<br />
Either that or you are the top dps in the world and healing wise you solo heal every fight for top hps too. I don't think either is the case.</div></div><hr />

First dragonwrath took 41 days 2011-06-28 to 2011-08-11<br />

Yeah and bare in mind that this rogue and his guild actually had more lockouts because of faction change and so most of the other rogues in top guilds are still 1-2 weeks away of their legendarys. RNG is also involved same with the staff.</div></div><hr />

I guess i was wrong!<br />
<br />
Still, kind of laughing about the ease of the first part of the quest chain. it was kind of a slap-in-the face that rogues can buy there 39(whatever) weapons for 10k and they have them on day 2 of the tier, whereas most classes (in my example, a feral tank) has to get to, and kill, deathwing. THEN defeat the RNG gods to see the drop, then defeat the RNG gods again to win the roll for it.</div></div><hr />

This player - Имбос is scammer, prooflink on http://www.prestige-gaming.ru/imbos_kidala_-t25719.html<br />
<br />
He deceived a man after selling his account for 19,000 rubles, returning it to yourself.<br />
<br />
Also, he is use transfer abuse (when player is transfer his cooldowns on raid is reset)<br />
<br />

Everyone in russian community can. What about transfer abuse, his armory confirms it totally/</div></div><hr />

Yeah they can confirm it. I mean if you look at his armory you can see that he has killed more bosses than would have been possible since the patch release. So yeah he has clearly abused it. The ID reset has been fixed by Blizzard in the meantime so I don´t see why he does not get removed gained benefits :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imbos (or Imbas) - or, spoken, &quot;I'm BOSS&quot; - obtained the Worlds First Legendary Rogue Daggers by:<br />
<br />
Cheat: Using a bug introduced with patch 4.3 where raid lockout did reset with (paid-for) character transfers. The bug was fixed only 3-Jan-2012.<br />
<br />
Lie: He offered his account for sale, claiming he wanted it no more.<br />
<br />
Steal: He then phoned Blizzard to get his account back, but did not return the money ($500).<br />
<br />
Cheat: He and his guild then paid Blizzard with this money to do character transfers.<br />
<br />
Rogue daggers, indeed.<br />
<br />
I am only amused how angry many others here are, thinking that you can obtain rogue daggers LEGALLY :cool: - the irony of it all seems to escape most here :)</div></div><hr />

It goddam brings them money. If they do something about it, it will bring them money only once. If they don't do anything about it, 10k more freakin rouges will do it, and 10k more freakin rouges will bring Blizzard money. Figure it out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwendion</div><div class="date">2012-01-14, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right - and what's more: It was a traditional heist in best &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot;-style. The only person who got hurt is one who tried to do something illegal (buying a WOW account), while Blizzard was made by them, unwittingly, &quot;partners in crime&quot;. They can't ban someone for something they got paid for, right? Very clever, indeed.<br />
You can all moan hard about the fact you didn't think of it first - they did, they planned it and then executed it. In my view: Truely world's first rogue daggers wielder. Honorable? no. But he got the job done :)<br />
Edit: Just to point it out again: The &quot;back door&quot;, the &quot;loop hole&quot; is closed now. It was used for the world's first, it cannot be used anymore ;)</div></div><hr />

Nah it is probably because Blizz gets lots of cash from those faction transfers so they have not banned the guild and this rogue yet :( Silly</div></div><hr />

Most 25 man guilds will be either next week or the week after depending on luck. I'm most likely getting mine in 2 weeks, but ya to get it this week there was probably some transfer shenanigans.</div></div><hr />

Yeah they had 2 extra resets due to the transfer. Most of the other 25 man guilds will get their daggers in 1-3 weeks like you :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm late to the party, but yea, it still works as of 4.2. I cleared FL in a guild run on a Wednesday, server transferred off after the raid (was changing guilds anyway) and was able to go in and do Firelands with my new guild on Thursday night. It was a realm transfer too (no faction change involved).</div></div><hr />

No, because they support cheats when they can make some cash out of it.</div></div><hr />
