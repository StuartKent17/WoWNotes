While Mists of Pandaria already comes packed full of some of the most diverse and expansive World of Warcraft content to date, we’re staying true to our goal of delivering new content faster. With that in mind, we’re pleased to share that the first major Mists of Pandaria content update, Patch 5.1, is well underway.<br />
In fact, our plan is to release a build of patch 5.1 on the Public Test Realms soon so you can experience it for yourself! Initially, the PTR build won’t include all of the 5.1 patch content, but here’s a glimpse of the major features that are already in the pipeline.<br />
<br />
Patch 5.1 Features<br />
<br />
Pandaria and the War of Conquest<br />
While members of the Horde and the Alliance have been busy exploring the exotic continent of Pandaria, Garrosh and Varian have been gathering their forces in preparation for the struggle to exert the influence of the Horde and the Alliance over these long-lost lands. Players who have quested through Pandaria will see forces of both factions arrive in force on the shores of the unspoiled continent, bringing the tensions between the Horde and the Alliance into sharp focus. New daily quest hubs and faction reputations will be available to adventurers eager to do their part in the brewing conflict.<br />
<br />
Brawler’s Guild<br />
Underground fighting rings have sprung up in Stormwind and Orgrimmar that will give brawlers a chance to earn bragging rights by testing their solo PvE mettle against some of the toughest creatures found in World of Warcraft. The first rule of brawls is you don’t talk about brawls. The second rule…<br />
<br />
Pet Battles Improvements<br />
Several UI and other improvements will be added to the Pet Battles system, including a way to upgrade the rarity of pets that you’ve captured.<br />
<br />
Item Upgrades<br />
You will be able to spend Valor Points to improve the item level and quality of gear you already own.<br />
<br />
The Quest Continues<br />
Wrathion is keenly interested in the conflict exploding between the factions on Pandaria’s southern shore. He’s sure to have additional tasks for players to complete as they continue their quest for Legendary gear.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is only a taste of what’s to come, and that there’s even more in store. Stay tuned for additional details as we prepare release Patch 5.1 for testing!</div></div><hr />

I wonder if your gear will be downscaled alla challenge modes for it!<br />

And w00p @ Item Upgrades really hope this is the system that stays in place rather than Valor Vendors!<br />

Dungeons + Raids for gear Valor Points to upgrade them!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not for me:) Having over 400+ pets so far, and over 50+ caught rares, it was not so much fun, as much as it was beginning to be a pain, not fun(then again I'm more a collector than a -must have all rare pets and be uber- type of person), having a good basis of rares, I like the idea of having the ability to upgrade other pets, so long as its not just a *oh i can make all 400+ pets of mines rare* button, then it sounds decent:)<br />
<br />
Guess we will see how they implement it^</div></div><hr />

I don't think he is saying that there isn't any raids in right now, which there will be 3 here shortly. I think more so pointing out that the first major patch of this xpac will come without a raid unlike the others. Granted in 4.2 we didn't get a new raid, but nearly every other major patch we have had new raid content added. There are exceptions of course during Vanilla and BC.</div></div><hr />

If they keep giving us this much content, my family is going to leave me...<br />
<br />
I saw Brawlers Guild, and thought &quot;are we going to queue for 1v1 PVP?&quot; and then read it was solo PvE... hmm, that seems like an odd addition for an MMO, but I'm excited to see what it's going to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's the &quot;proving grounds&quot; idea they were discussing, it might be based on spec. For example, you might have an NPC ally you have to keep healed rather than fight if you're healing spec.<br />
<br />
It's interesting, though.<br />
<br />
Also, Ghostcrawler had said at one point they were hoping to do more frequent, smaller, patches with a raid, no raid, raid, no raid pattern being possible. I kinda like that idea.</div></div><hr />

4.1, actually, was Rise of the Zandalari and only featured the revamped ZG and the rehashed ZA. So far, only Wrath had a raid in every content patch, one of which was the widely reviled Trial of the Crusader. TBC had the often-forgotten patch 2.2, the introduction of in-game Voice Chat.</div></div><hr />

Please don't make it like that again. If you must implement dailies &amp; reputations please make it so we can share tokens and/or rep with alts on the same account. I wound up with nearly 200 unused World Tree Marks on my main after doing all the Molten Front stuff and my alts could've used those to close gear gaps from unlucky drop rates. Please also don't make it so these new dailies will be required to remain raid competitive like Molten Front was initially. Brawler's Guild sounds cool though, same with item upgrades (this is much better than the Firestone version from Firelands. We never saw a single Firestone drop that entire patch. And still haven't even after it was no longer current content and we were getting a guildmate's legendary staff). Valor Points are definitely a much better choice for upgrading items.</div></div><hr />

I'm gunning for that 150/175 mount achievement.. Hopefully they give a cool mount reward, like an infinite drake... The dragon hawk felt a little hackneyed. <br />

If you stepped out of azeroth, you'd realize that other devs have released as good, if not better quality updates in shorter time periods than blizzard. Take off the goggles and see what's really happening. There's a reason mop was one of the least hyped xpacs out there, and it's blizzard's track record from disappointing people. Diablo 3 was in the works for years, that game should have been the end all be all mother of all games, but look at what we got.<br />
<br />
Thus, blizzard has a long-long way to go to win people back. WoW isn't going to do this. It's too dated, and a fresh coat of paint over rust doesn't fix the problem. They'll introduce their new mmo this year, even though that has went through some critical issues in it's development. If they don't show it this year, they have nothing, and they're in trouble.</div></div><hr />

Did I just read a complaint when it comes to faster content ?!?!?!? While you may have a point that the quality of content may drop the faster it is released, I would just rather have those faster patches rather then sitting on the same content for months waiting for the next big patch.<br />
<br />
If they do it the patch cycles like this, <br />
<br />
5.1 - Dailies / additional quests / other content etc<br />
5.2 - New Raid / Heroics<br />
5.3 - more other content outside of Raids, maybe focus on PVP somewhat (gotta throw them a bone here and there)<br />
<br />
I would be pleased, as content doesn't take long to stagnant in an MMO, whether it is a raid or having to do dailies etc. I will welcome faster patching at all means.</div></div><hr />

I'm THIS &quot;--&quot; interested in your oh so original post filled with subjectivity, theories and biased arguments. :). People have been pulling your story since TBC, get over it. Those other companies might release content faster, but at least to me, that content ain't worth squat since I don't enjoy their games.<br />
<br />
And as for the rest, it wasn't a complaint about the content, it's a concern with how it'll pan out in the long run. Will it affect WHAT we get and how often? Or is this simply a new approach to releasing smaller patches with actual content between the big ones where we get tiers? <br />

While I can agree to your reasoning, for someone who wants to collect all the pets in the game and wanting them all rare, with the actual way of getting rare pets, it would take months and months of grinding. This is a fine alternative, as long as they don't make it too easy to make them rare.</div></div><hr />

The way they are doing patches in MoP is splitting each patch into 2. You'll have the 'casual' patch with the dailies and whatnot and then the 'raider' patch. Overall there would be 6 patches if they do this with all 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeh, i welcome the change aswell. But i hope it's some kind of training (could be a battle pet quest for example) to uppgrade it. Maybe a daily quest to let you uppgrade 1 each day.<br />
<br />
Cause it's not that hard to get rare pets even now, just need to look for pets with more HP then they usualy have in that area ;D</div></div><hr />

Please don't make it like that again. If you must implement dailies &amp; reputations please make it so we can share tokens and/or rep with alts on the same account. I wound up with nearly 200 unused World Tree Marks on my main after doing all the Molten Front stuff and my alts could've used those to close gear gaps from unlucky drop rates. Please also don't make it so these new dailies will be required to remain raid competitive like Molten Front was initially. Brawler's Guild sounds cool though, same with item upgrades (this is much better than the Firestone version from Firelands. We never saw a single Firestone drop that entire patch. And still haven't even after it was no longer current content and we were getting a guildmate's legendary staff). Valor Points are definitely a much better choice for upgrading items.<br />
<br />
Just so you know in an interview recently the molten front thing was addressed and they said it was too cumbersome and took far too long to progress to each area, and they will be doing it again but it will take far less time to progress. They also talked about the progression possibly being reputation based versus using an obscure currency so when you gain a new reputation level you gain access to the new areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, I believe his point was that he doesn't want to sacrifice quality for speed. As we've seen in plenty of other games recently, pushing out a Day One DLC is pretty common these days. So while I'm happy that Blizzard is putting out 5.1 so quickly, I hope they can keep up the pace and still advance the story.<br />
<br />
I've been very happy with most of MoP so far, it's much better than Cataclysm from what I've seen so far (lvl 89.5 with my main, lvl 44 with my monk), so let's hope they can keep it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may explain why they are doubling rep gains from revered to exalted. That said, once you are revered with factions there's little rush to get to exalted as most of the offerings are for vanity purposes. I am planning on saving some of those grinds for later in the expansion when I don't have so much else to do.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that Blizzard is really embracing the idea of adding replay value to the game through the addition of leaderboards. I think it is a pretty solid idea and am curious how it's going to play out in the long run.</div></div><hr />

to me any content patch that doesnt involve a new raid isnt a content patch. <br />
<br />
I admit brawler stuff could be fun but it might as well be crap. I dont like to speculate but out of all the things they announced this seems the most acceptable.<br />
<br />
wrathion questline is always nice but it hasnt been a secret that with every patch that comes out his questline will continue so its no surprise and therefore not really worth it to announce?! Its going to be fun but legendary quests usually last about what... 1-2 hours at max? and you can do it only once per character so overall thats very little content to hold you over until 5.2 comes.<br />
<br />
Pet Battle improvements. I know there are a lot of people out there who enjoy pet battles and once I start doing them I will probably enjoy them as well but again. This is not content. its an improvement to a recently added feature. some people dont even do pet battles or are annoyed by it or feel its too pokemon-y. those players cant get anything out of this.<br />
<br />
Item upgrades.<br />
I dont know when 5.1 hits but if Item upgrades come out after most of the guilds have cleared 16/16 heroic then what do they need the upgrade for? This seems like a good implementation overall but why not release it with the raid that (hopefully) comes after that? I guess item upgrades will be available for any future real content patches but they seem pointless to implement into a raidless time.<br />
<br />
overall I am very sceptical about this patch. It can be very good but it can also be very bad. The last time I said this about a patch was the zandalari patch 4.1 and it turned out to be one of the most horrible things that have ever happened to WoW. Since theres nothing I can do about it I just hope that its gonna turn out at least better than 4.1</div></div><hr />

Self centered bastards, this is exacly what WoW needs, things to keep it fresh and moveing forward while they work on the next major raid / season etc. For gods sake people you are whats wrong with this game, when something benefitial and GOOD happens to this game you dis it and complain.<br />
<br />
Also if you were actually smart you would know that there are 2 more raids in Tier 14 (the tier we are at the moment). i guess 16 bosses is not enough for you huh? ''eyeroll''</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lefrog</div><div class="date">2012-10-05, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">overall I am very sceptical about this patch. It can be very good but it can also be very bad. The last time I said this about a patch was the zandalari patch 4.1 and it turned out to be one of the most horrible things that have ever happened to WoW. Since theres nothing I can do about it I just hope that its gonna turn out at least better than 4.1<br />
<br />
I wonder if you didn't like 4.1 because you didn't like the content that was added, or because of the content that should have been added but wasn't. I already had my pre-4.1 amani bear, and while I didn't really care about getting the new one, I did like jumping back in there with my guildies and reminiscing. Same goes for ZG. I also enjoyed having a steadier source of maelstrom crystals. <br />
<br />
4.1 for me was only bad because of the content that was missing and desperately needed. I have a feeling 5.1 will be like 4.1, but that they are going to put it out in half the time. Meaning that when we had 4.1 in cata is about when we will be seeing 5.2 and a new raid.</div></div><hr />

its funny how you talk about me not being able to read when you didnt read my post yourself. I already mentioned 16/16 heroic so you can safely assume that I know that there are 16 bosses in the game even though they are not all accessible yet. try reading AND understanding a post before you go lash out on me, thx &lt;3<br />
<br />
I know that this isnt the whole patch but do you really think if they had more important things to announce they would hold them back? Do you really think a day before 5.1 hits blizzard is gonna be like &quot;oh btw we also added 12 new bosses and they are awesome, have fun with them tomorrow&quot;? I hope they love you in that dream world youre living.<br />
<br />
I didnt diss anything or anyone. I said I am skeptical about this patch because it can be very good but it can also be very bad. I said it again here because you seem to need a few attempts at reading a post in order to understand what people are actually saying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, you say that I am what is wrong with the community. All I did was share the concerns that I have with this patch, they are very reasonable (if you actually read them) and this is what a forum is for, to share thoughts and look at the pros and cons, which I did. The rest of your post was an insult and a complaint which ok when it comes from you but is satans work when it comes from others. Again, your dream world, I hope you like it there because sadly I dont think youre going to leave.</div></div><hr />

it depends on how you look at it. ZA and ZG werent bad or anything but they removed the actual ZA and ZG for it. some people didnt like that, I didnt care for it. If I roflstomp through ZA I dont really reminisce of the countless times we tried the last 2 bosses and how triumphant it was for us to actually kill them. the gear it rewarded was outdated the moment it dropped.

mostly, I didnt like 4.1 because of the lack of raiding content and I though 4.2 was fairly weak and didnt give us enough to do. they should have delivered 4.2 with 4.1 and it would have been great and nobody would have complained ever.</div></div><hr />

i just dont see how you can compare this to 4.1. sure there isnt any new raid content but the content that is there is all brand new content. blizz said not every patch in mists will be a raid patch they said they would like 1 or 2 patches with smaller content like scenarios and questlines they can pump out quickly inbetween raids.</div></div><hr />

going by what you just said how can you NOT compare 5.1 to 4.1?<br />

it was only re-hashed content for those who had already played ZA and ZG. I guess thats why they rehashed it to begin with. Not many people got to see those 2 raidinstances and with 4.1 they got the revamped version and for them it was all new stuff.<br />

new daily hubs, scenarios and all that is fine, as I said I am looking forward to it. but in my opinion it is not enough to be called content patch. the world events like brewfest and childrens week also had new dailies, items and in some cases a new boss or even world boss (think Omen back in the day) but they didnt call it content patch and they didnt make a big thing out of it because it wasnt a big thing.

and you know that how? wheres your source? and how long is it going to be until 5.2 comes, the hopefully real content patch? Or better yet how long from 5.0 to 5.2?</div></div><hr />

Think you need to be a bit careful saying only patches that have raids are &quot;Real Content&quot;.<br />
<br />
Look we get it, you hate everything single thing in WoW other than raiding, god forbid they give you a patch that does not please your exact requirement.<br />
<br />
For crying out loud it is less than 2 weeks since MoP is released and your already going &quot;OMG they are releasing a patch that does not contain a Raid&quot; that is not &quot;Real Content&quot; really?<br />
<br />
I love raiding, but you know what I want stuff that give me something to do other than on the nights I raid, I don't want wow to fell stale I want it to fell like something is constantly going on.<br />
<br />
I would MUCH rather have<br />
<br />
5.0 Raids<br />
5.1 Other Content (2-3 Months In).<br />
5.2 Raid (2-3 Months Later)<br />
5.3 Other Content (2-3 Months Later).<br />
<br />
I do think there is going to be a 5-6 month gap between raids.<br />
<br />
I am hoping T14 lasts for 5-6 months (16 bosses) then we get smaller raids but more frequently (maybe 4-5 months between raids)</div></div><hr />

4.1 was a lazy patch, pure and simple. You can defend it up and down, but it existed only to keep the fanbase from losing it waiting 7 months for Firelands.<br />

He was wrong about Jade Forest, it's actually Krasarang Wilds, and how much it'll be changed is completely up-in-the-air. But that's the point. We know very little about this patch, and you're already complaining about lack of content. The daily hub could be the best thing since sliced bread, and the Brawler's Guild could breathe new life into the single-player experience. Or they could be complete throwaways (like the holidays you mentioned). And they said that's not all to the patch. The fact is, we don't know anything, most of us are just happy that we're hearing about another patch so soon. So I ask you, WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT?</div></div><hr />

I think you might be setting the bar a little high :)<br />

As long as the current tier does not last in months longer than the number of bosses (AKA DS 8 bosses for 10 months) it will be an improment step in the right direction!<br />
<br />
That raises an interesting question though.<br />

I had suggested that they do something similar to the FF7 Battle Square where you just go up against mob after mob after mob in one on one battle where it gradually gets harder and maybe you get status ailments or random silences or something. Looks like they were listening (so what if they weren't. In my book, this was my idea!).</div></div><hr />

People have been pulling your story since TBC, get over it. Those other companies might release content faster, but at least to me, that content ain't worth squat since I don't enjoy their games.<br />
<br />
And as for the rest, it wasn't a complaint about the content, it's a concern with how it'll pan out in the long run. Will it affect WHAT we get and how often? Or is this simply a new approach to releasing smaller patches with actual content between the big ones where we get tiers? <br />

Blizzard has tried their hardest to fulfill all of your complaints yet you keep complaining. I'm convinced that there is nothing blizzard can do to stop the whiners. The funny thing is that the majority of the whiners DON'T EVEN PLAY WOW. Please just go back under whatever bridge you came from and let us enjoy our game. MoP is hands down the best expansion to date, and blizz just keeps on surprising me. Brawlers guild sounds like loads of fun. I love having single player content to do because sometimes I like being alone. Thank you blizzard for putting out in my opinion the best game I have ever played. If you keep this up I will never go outside again :P.</div></div><hr />

Yup pretty much. No matter what new stuff they give people they'll always whine. Maybe threatening to stop making content would get...a quarter of the complainer's attentions.</div></div><hr />

Look we get it, you hate everything single thing in WoW other than raiding<br />
<br />
how can you say that when in my last post I stated:<br />

<br />
new daily hubs, scenarios and all that is fine, as I said I am looking forward to it. <br />
<br />
you really dont get where I am going with my posts, maybe you should stop reading them alltogether. they will just make you angry if you dont understand what youre reading.<br />

<br />
4.1 was a lazy patch, pure and simple. You can defend it up and down, but it existed only to keep the fanbase from losing it waiting 7 months for Firelands.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
dont worry I will never defend 4.1 patch. I think 4.1 was the beginning of the end that led to blizzards subscriber loss during the last expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I ask you, WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT?<br />
<br />
I am not complaining about anything. I said that any content patch that does not include a raid is not a real content patch in my opinion. This is a definition and not a complaint. I know that this was just an anouncement and we know very little about what actually will come in 5.1. <br />
Again if you had read my posts then you wouldnt have to go all captain caps lock on me but here you go:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I didnt diss anything or anyone. I said I am skeptical about this patch because it can be very good but it can also be very bad. I said it again here because you seem to need a few attempts at reading a post in order to understand what people are actually saying.<br />
<br />
<br />

5.1 is a minor content patch.<br />
5.2 will be a Raid patch. <br />
5.3 will be minoir.<br />
5.4 will be a Raid patch. <br />
And etc. <br />
Stop QQ. We gonna get raid every 4 month. And minor patch every two month!<br />
<br />
I wish you were right but this is just complete speculation and not a reasonable one at that. If MoP lasts lets say 18 months until a new expansion comes out then according to your calculation we would be at patch 5.9 after 16 months. Do you really think there will ever be 9 content patches during one expansion? I highly doubt it.</div></div><hr />

Not speculation. Blizzard have said numerous times about MoP that they want to make the patch cycle faster, with more numerous patches. However to be fair, they said the same in Cata, and we all know how that went. One would think, however, that they have learned their lesson and step up their game now that they actually have to compete for it; if there's one thing the Cata subscription drops showed, it's that they can't get away with such an abysmal content release rate.</div></div><hr />

The way they phrase it, it seems that the changes will only be there for people who have already reached level 90.<br />
<br />
If you go to Krasarang Wilds, there are a couple locations there which are currently empty, and most likely those will be converted into the new quest hubs.<br />
<br />
We've also had some indication from interviews that the blood elves and the Reliquary faction is going to be involved in the Horde side in this patch, and that Lor'themar Theron (who?) would be doing something.<br />

That boost back to 10 million + subscribers must have given them a big moral boost.<br />
They actually have been working on Patch 5.1 and 5.2 simultaneously since work on 5.0 started finishing up. They're essentially working two patches deep now, instead of just one at a time, as was the case before. Plus preliminary work (namely art and story direction) on their next expansion has already begun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, to the guy who asked if anyone thinks they'd ever have nine patches in one expansion? They had 13 in Classic WoW, some of which were as small as a new BG or dungeon, while a few added new raids. Their development cycle is probably gonna be closer to that. They've indicated that they want new raid tiers every 4-6 months or so, with minor content patches in between.<br />
<br />

I hope that they announce the Warlock faction at this patch.<br />

And that is what I have a problem with.<br />
<br />
So they could release a patch with 2 5 mans, 1 scenerio and a new BG and it would not be &quot;Real Content&quot;.<br />
<br />
So in your opinion Vanilla only had 4 &quot;Real Content&quot; patches? Even though they released 12 content patches.<br />
<br />
This statement can be read as &quot;I want a new raid every content patch&quot;.<br />
<br />
I would much rather this was NOT the case.<br />
<br />
I want the world to fell alive, I want constant changes I don't want 6 months of no change then a MASSIVE patch which is amazing, then we play through the new content and in 2 months we are bored and only running raids.<br />
<br />
They have stated this is the aim (and that you will NOT get a raid every patch).<br />
<br />
Will they manage to do it?<br />
<br />
No idea but I really hope they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah that part is correct. I was just pointing out that one cant say that we are guaranteed to get a new raid tier every 4 months, blizzard never stated anything along those lines and I think it wouldnt be possible for them anyway.<br />
I am all for new patches and the quests, scenarios and dungeons that come with them but I just know that any &quot;content&quot; patch that doesnt come with a new raid tier will look just awful compared to one that does.</div></div><hr />

It will come in 2 months time and we just had MV opened this week, with 2 more raids coming in about a month. If blizzard would release new tier in 5.1 it would made all this raids pointless as people would skip as much as they could to get better gerar from latest one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just nitpicking. If a common pet has stats x and y and then you upgrade it so that it's stats are x+1 and y+1 then it will be more rare than the regular version with lesser stats.</div></div><hr />
