<meta name="description" content="AVR Mod Broken in 3.3.5 
This is a notice that we&#8217;re making changes in 3.3.5 in attempts to break the ability for the AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) mod to continue functioning. For those unaware, this mod allows players to draw in the 3D space of the game world, which can then be shared with others who are also using the mod. In some cases this manifests itself through drawing/tagging/defacing the game world, but more popularly is used to give visual guides for dungeon and raid encounters.

This is a notice that we&#8217;re making changes in 3.3.5 in attempts to break the ability for the AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) mod to continue functioning. For those unaware, this mod allows players to draw in the 3D space of the game world, which can then be shared with others who are also using the mod. In some cases this manifests itself through drawing/tagging/defacing the game world, but more popularly is used to give visual guides for dungeon and raid encounters.<br />
<br />
We&#8217;re making this change for two reasons. The invasive nature of a mod altering and/or interacting with the game world (virtually or directly) is not intended and not something we will allow. World of Warcraft UI addons are never intended to interact with the game world itself. This is mirrored in our stance and restriction of model and texture alterations. The second reason is that it removes too much player reaction and decision-making while facing dungeon and raid encounters. While some other mods also work to this end, we find that AVR and the act of visualizing strategy within the game world simply goes beyond what we&#8217;re willing to allow.<br />
<br />
The change we&#8217;re making in attempts to break the functionality is light in its touch and approach. When blocking any functionality we run the risk of affecting other mods, but we&#8217;ve targeted the changes as carefully as possible. If we find that the AVR mod (or any mod attempting to replicate its functions) are usable after 3.3.5 we will take further, more drastic steps. <br />
<br />
If you do not remember what AVR is, here is a small reminder.<br />

This isn't a lot of information but it's the most we can get these days!<br />
It is 100 yards. The new implementation isn't a totem, but an effect that radiates from an existing totem.<br />

Let people use AVR to &quot;draw on the world&quot; for pre-combat strategizing, etc. Once you pull, though, the &quot;AVR is broken&quot; code comes in.</div></div><hr />

Again: why? Why do you think that DBM is okay and AVR isn't? DBM plays instead of you too! It visualizes the cooldowns of the boss for example...<br />

DBM says: FIRE, MOVE!!!<br />
AVR says: Fire, move over here (shows safe spot), then go there (again, shows spot) for next phase, stand here (same thing) to avoid aoe damage and jump here (and again) to avoid mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a big difference between an advanced Raid Warning telling you to get out of fire or to run away and the RL being able to draw the radius and area of a Boss's ability right into the world and sharing it with everyone else simultaneously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You didn't have to use it so why it annoyed you?<br />
Then every Blizzard UI users should be annoyed because of healbot/Grid users?<br />
Every manual decurser should be annoyed because of decursive users?</div></div><hr />

Besides, it's not like we wont just use an addon that makes a chat bubble appear over someone's head saying &quot;EVIL SPAWNING ON ME, RUN AWAY!&quot;</div></div><hr />

You still have to think while playing with DBM because you can run in 360 degrees, but AVR takes this thinking away.<br />
If you play with both DBM and AVR you know when, how and where to move and yes, that takes away a lot of thinking!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How you can compare AVR with DBM? <br />
- The one is timers the other is visual marks<br />
- The one it's telling you &quot;Defile in 3 secs&quot; the other is telling you &quot;Hey retard here is a circle don't step into it&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
DBM also makes you able to yell if you get bombs for example.<br />
And what decides the border between the addons that play instead of you? What makes an addon that warns you when you should move away acceptable and an addon that tells you where you shouldn't stay unacceptable?<br />
Of course Blizzard does that! And if the decide that AVR should be banned it should. My only problem is only this attitude. Everybody says, that AVR is for monkeys, etc, but I am sure that they all use DBM for example, or grid, decursive, etc...</div></div><hr />

Imho the difference is in telling you what to do as on the edge of acceptable and how and where to move as over the edge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not true. See the sample video. Without AVR do you really have to &quot;THINK&quot; about where to run? No. You'll have absolutely no idea where to run, just run the hell out of the boss. Not thinking, just brainless running... :)<br />
With AVR you get a visualisation where goos will explode and you have to do and extremely fast THINKING about where is the best position to run.<br />
So AVR makes malleable goo managing a mindgame, it is normally a brainless run away game.</div></div><hr />

And what decides the border between the addons that play instead of you? What makes an addon that warns you when you should move away acceptable and an addon that tells you where you shouldn't stay unacceptable?<br />
Of course Blizzard does that! And if the decide that AVR should be banned it should. My only problem is only this attitude. Everybody says, that AVR is for monkeys, etc, but I am sure that they all use DBM for example, or grid, decursive, etc...<br />

Well,there is no player in the world that doesn't use any addon,even in top world guilds while they are farming bosses. But i guess then even Marrowgar normal mode would be hard for casuals if there is no dbm for example.</div></div><hr />

When I saw that AVR is drawing a circle for every possible position target of the malleable goo, was obvious that is the end of the addon. I am sure that Blizz would have left it if it was usable only out of combat and/or is not using players coordinates while in combat.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard does not understand or did not articulate difference between AVR and AVRE in first place. Blue post indicates they are killing AVR drawing abilities together with the encounter part. They are also singling out AVR when there is so many other addons doing the same job just less well. Blizzard has always protected its game integrity by limiting interaction of addons with game mechanics but now it goes beyond technicalities. AVR was not pressing buttons for player like auto-bots or Decursive could in the past. The threat at the end of post is also blunt spit in the face of mod community. WOW raiding would not be where it is now without all those people developing addons for free for our benefits. <br />

Actually, from my understanding, there is PLENTY of ways they could break AVR without impacting hardly anything else at all. Easiest way would be to turn off / prevent addons from reading player coordinates during boss fights. Boom. AVR irrevocably dead.</div></div><hr />

Never used it...does it show to anyone not using the mod? Does it change the code of the game in anyway? I'm guessing not so it isn't a hack and this is a change in policy that can be debated...lets debate it.</div></div><hr />

The problem there is with the concept, and the author not blizzard stance towards it.<br />
As long as authors produce a scoring system then the problem will never go away.<br />
<br />
Breaking AVR is more about the drawing in such a way that something relates to the surface of the game world.<br />
That is what will be broken, so other more traditional boss mods will be unaffected.<br />
Being able to calculate the camera pitch is one feature I am sure they are breaking for that reason, but there could well be others.</div></div><hr />

Smoke Flares<br />
Jewel prism laser things<br />
Target Dummies<br />
Tonks<br />
Hunter's pets<br />
Hunters marks<br />

Back in classic it used to be a case of either naming mobs and hoping people remember or, more commonly, having everyone follow the hunter's mark. These days we have so many more tools that it shouldn't be an issue.<br />

Unless thinking makes your brain hurt, in which case i'm very sorry for your loss in AVR.<br />

Seriously, shut up about it, people. The company that made the add-on didn't force millions of fickle baddies to suddenly form a cult over flashy, colored numbers. You verbally force blizz to take away this helpful add-on and you're just going to get 5 million wow-heroes.com groupies again. Simmer, bitches. &lt;3</div></div><hr />

probably disable GetPlayerMapPosition(&quot;unit&quot;) or disable it in instances...<br />

Since Wotlk i nearly can´t see anything as a tank or melee, the game is full of new lightningeffects, blinkblink etc....without any modification i couldn´t play harder encounters. <br />
AVR is a brilliant Addon to keep up a little bit more overview and if it makes some fights to easy, then Blizz make the fights simply harder....but that would cost blizzard work, so its cheaper to ban a realy nice addon....i realy hope the AVR creators keep up their work, there will be always ways to keep this addon working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because I have seen it on my server. Not that I would use the term noobs though. Lot's of 10m teams stuck on 9/12 heroic, then they got AVR and are now beating their head against LK hc. And yes, they praised AVR as the main reason they learned to move in the Sindra fight and so on. <br />
<br />
But as you say, I don't care. The players I have seen using AVR for their advantage, are nice people but without the big raid experience. AVR helped them get pass the hurdle, and that is fine. It worked for them, and gave them some pretty drakes. They would no doubt have beaten the encounters in the end, AVR just made it a tad more easy, and they got there a faster. <br />
<br />
None in my 10m wanted to use it, so we just didn't, and in my 25m our raidleader laid the big NO-AVR rule early on. We play for fun, not for competition, and AVR takes the fun away for many of us.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm glad to see AVR go bye bye</div></div><hr />

Easiest way would be to turn off / prevent addons from reading player coordinates during boss fights. Boom. AVR irrevocably dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually they did it by removing the camera features, such as cameraDistance and cameraPitch. It destroys AVR's ability to detect the players movement/facing and thus would not be able to render anything in the right place. I don't see blizzard disabling map coords right now because that would be entirely too far. Unless blizzard finally decides to implement an api for a real range finder, they won't mess with coords because one of the most important features boss mods offer is the range finder, since blizzard puts SOO many spells into encounters with very specific spread ranges and no api to speak of to do it besides mathematical calculations using the map or other hacks like bandages, inspect, and trade.. Very common range finders for ICC though are 8 and 12, which you can only get with map coords.</div></div><hr />

Are you fucking serious? If I was the creator of AVR I'd be well pissed off. This game is so patheticly easy, you don't really need any addons to play it, even on the top levels. <br />
<br />
How about you retards @ Blizz figure out that banning addons is not the way to go, instead make instances a challenge like they used to be back in TBC. Kudos to AVR creator, I wasn't using the addon for more than one raid because it just seems like you're playing some sort of old DOS game rather than WoW, but nonetheless was funny to draw penises and send them to the whole raid.<br />

Everyone did that, right?<br />

Gearscore doesn't go against the regulations where as AVR apparently does. Not only that but gearscore doesn't interfere with the game whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, I hate gearscore just as much as you do !<br />

and even if you can name one, then please name one that will draw into the game world on its own.<br />
there, now you see why it shouldnt exist<br />
<br />
You fail at understanding of what is really going on. Nobody is really bothered that an addon can draw pictures into a game world of another user using the same addon. Blizzard expressly stated they do not like the way AVR-E (E is important although Blizzard failed to note that in their blue post) simplifies the decision-making process. Tinfoil hats on, Blizzard is getting into your head!!<br />
<br />
AVR does not modify game files or game graphic engines. Drawings made in it are only visible to other AVR users. AVR communicates the same was as Recount or DBM does--understandably the traffic is a lot heavier that is why the addon is not good for slow machines as it can significantly lower performance.<br />
AVR does not draw out of its own, all those shapes, spots and routes must be drawn by a person. Only then they can be saved and used by AVR-E to be projected to other addon users in game based on events happening ingame. AVR-E is nothing else than DBM it is just more advanced. Where DBM show you an arrow on Thaddius, AVR-E would show nice circle with big modeled arrow showing you the way.<br />
<br />
It is disturbing that Blizzard expends effort to stop an addon instead of learning from its creators on how to make useful UI on its own. Absolute props to the creator of AVR as he was able to create addon providing lots of added value to those willing to use it.</div></div><hr />

Don't know if it's actual sarcasm or not but I'll bite. Quite easy, just pick a PUG who isn't actually asking for GS. Or even better, start your own PUG ? If a RL of a PUG relies too much on GS, something isn't right. Armory the guy and check his overall gear and/or achievements and make your own conclusions.</div></div><hr />

It's not like DBM that simply tells you you're standing in the fire. Besides, even the default UI now has pop-up warnings, DBM just makes it easier to see them. <br />
<br />
On a side note, I'm seeing a lot of people saying that GearScore(GS) needs to be broken. This confuses me for several reasons. Every item has an ilvl. Even without factoring in spec, gems, enchants, etc, your gear will still have an average and total ilvl score, or more commonly known as &quot;gear score&quot;. They added the ilvl to the tooltips on gear several patches ago, so the only way you could &quot;break&quot; GS would be to remove that particular bit of information from being accessed. Blizzard is not known for removing functionality after it's been implemented (they've done it, but it's extremely rare). Also, even if they removed access to the ilvl information, coders would still be able to &quot;assign&quot; a value to the item, thus keeping the GS addon alive.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that confuses me about the people saying it needs to be broken is why you're mad at the addon and not the morons that abuse its purpose. As plenty have said everywhere else, before GS there was Armory, before Armory there was /inspect and before people widely used /inspect there was DamageMeters, Recount and other methods of measuring people.<br />

<br />
<br />
Picked this one out of all the &quot;gg AVR is broken lol sucks to be you l2p you suck if you use AVR&quot;. <br />
<br />
I have a good feeling about claiming that most of you have never done the fights where AVR really brought some handy aspect to it. Sure, I dont need AVR to path a way to the bonespiked people..people would need glasses if they can't see spiked people. Ofcourse I don't need AVR to put a circle under MCed people at Lady D, since they grow 3 times their normal size. I don't need circles at Rotface for the explosion, just leg it. <br />
<br />
However, the circles it uses for the spores at Festergut are handy, but not necessary, the icons &amp; spore graphic above the people suffice. But where AVR really shines, is the Unbound Plague on Professor heroic.<br />
<br />
You're doing the fight, dodging Mallable Goos, getting chased by a Gascloud, whilst hugging an Ooze, with explosive flasks on the floor, and green puddles appearing everywhere. On top of that, there's a disease that needs to be transferred over to someone else every so few seconds. Do it too soon, and you'll run out of people to transfer it to. Do it too late, and you're dead. Now, with crap flying all over your screen, whilst watching your rotation, a small blackcloud appears on the person who has it. Does a big orange circle with a timer make this easier? Yes, it makes a very, very hard fight a little bit easier. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying that I think it's bad that AVR needs to go, I do understand it, and I'm fine with it. It's merely the pure hate of the people who think they are so good and never used it whilst usually those people are average players.<br />
<br />
And for the people yelling &quot;lol a monkey could play WOW with AVR&quot; and &quot;you're a robot if you use AVR&quot; .. then why not disable Auctioneer as well? Decursive? Questhelper addons? Gearscore? These are all addons that automate stuff that players can do themselves, but these addons are classified as efficient I suppose. However, when it comes to raiding, people yell that addons make it too easy. Sigh. Some of you are shortsighted &amp; narrowminded fools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter how the wow coding works. AVR uses systems used by other mods aswell, if they want to kill the drawing, expect tons of addons to get nuked down, since its basicly the same as drawing panels on the screen, just more creative. If they kill its targeting mechanisms, except every form of range check in the game to go away. They could also kill the option to find out what a boss is targeting with say malleable goo, but that not only hurts mods like DBM, but will also have an effect on those who don't use addons since usually that kind of data is available anyway (debuffs, bosses targeting someone and so on).<br />
<br />
Its most likely that they will remove the coordinate system looking at these posibilities, I don't think this will hurt too many addons but it will hit some for sure.</div></div><hr />

Without AVR do you really have to &quot;THINK&quot; about where to run? No. You'll have absolutely no idea where to run, just run the hell out of the boss. Not thinking, just brainless running... :)<br />
With AVR you get a visualisation where goos will explode and you have to do and extremely fast THINKING about where is the best position to run.<br />
So AVR makes malleable goo managing a mindgame, it is normally a brainless run away game.<br />

You instinctively dodge to the left or right because the car is coming from 1 direction aka malleable goo or icehowl.<br />

It's funny to see a ton of people who use one hand holding mod (which I do as well) railing against another hand holding mod because it's doing hand holding in a slightly different way.<br />
<br />
What I really hope is that the makers of AVR just make it require that everyone in the raid have flares in their backpacks and auto aim them to mark things. Despite what every Joe WoW thinks about AVR, it was a natural evolution of DBM, and a pretty cool one.<br />

You still have to think while playing with DBM because you can run in 360 degrees, but AVR takes this thinking away.<br />
If you play with both DBM and AVR you know when, how and where to move and yes, that takes away a lot of thinking! <br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know which version of DBM you are using but my DBM also tells me where to go. For example in the Putricide fight it shows an arrow so you dont get hit by the goo. Same was true for Thaddius when it told you if you need to switch side. And using Powerauras you can also have boss abilities (mostly debuffs on you) visualized. Btw in my humble opinion the timers are mutch more ubar the AVR drawings. So I dont get the point.</div></div><hr />

Timer bars, range checks, and warning noises are a crutch. Then they can take away threat meters, since a good player should know how their threat is without an addon. Maybe take away grid after that, it totally oversimplifies the game. Next would be cooldown bars and their ilk, since graphical representations of when abilities come up are obviously only used by terrible players. Real hardcore players know when abilities come off CD instinctively.<br />
<br />
After that? Bye bye Auctioneer, scanning the whole auction house and suggesting prices just ruins the game. Auctioneer plays the auction house for you, I don't want that junk. Maybe Prat will fall next, since Prat makes it way too easy to read and organize chat. And we definitely have to get rid of Carbonite. It tells you exactly where to quest, where to go, who to talk to. Makes the game WAY too easy.</div></div><hr />

The only issue Blizzard seems (i,e all that was communicated) was that it crossed the line into interfering with the user interface, or the 3D space.<br />
<br />
- DBM/BigWigs/DXE timer bars are not guilty of such actions (Nor are arrows based off timers/presence of debuff/buff)<br />
<br />

<br />
AVR can provide any information that is viewable from your mini-map and debuff bar. It can also talk to any other AVR player to make a decision. Relying on AVR alone would be like playing with just your interface (and mini map) turned on, without seeing any of the game world. Now AVR takes that data and projects it onto the screen using the camera angle to try and overlap it with the terrain. AVR does not know what height you are at (although provided you aren't floating in mid air that could be programmed in) or if your camera is closer than it is naturally due to having a wall close to your back.<br />
<br />
AVR cannot tell you any details that are only visible from looking spell effects (such as Mimiron's rockets). It can't tell you where the ghosts are in Lady Deathwisper, or what direction to run if they hit you.<br />
<br />
I want to know how blizzard is breaking AVR, and what they mean by similar mods. The easiest way to break AVR without affecting most other mods is to prevent the query of the camera's angle. If they do this you can still use mods like Hudmap (still in development) which provide the same functionality, except its like having a giant mini map on your screen showing you the same stuff AVR does, but not augmented on the ground. It would be difficult to break that without breaking the range checker. Although they could simply remove the ability to get coordinate data and instead provide a simple 'distance to player in your raid' function instead.</div></div><hr />

Also AVR putting a circle under a player with malleable goo is different from DBM putting a marker on the player with it... how ? It's the same thing, one is more visible than the other.<br />
<br />
IMO, AVR was esentially identical to DBM - the difference being it made a more visual message rather than text, i.e. circles instead of markers, both annouce the same thing, just in a different fashion.<br />
<br />
For a lot of us, it had nothing to do with being monkeys, when the bomb explodes in Festergut(?) and you all run away, I know when to run and am able to guess the proximity of the blasts, but why run 20 yds to be safe when AVR tells me 10yds is enough? Why keep a text based range check on screen, when AVR shows a circle instead? Why keep grid to track debuff markers tell me who isn't infected in Putty HM when AVR will place a marker on whom isnt? People are overlooking the fact that we already use addons to do everything AVR did, it was just more convenient and lightweight.<br />

Did you read the blue post? No, seriously. Did you? If you need, I'll repost the relevant parts here.<br />
<br />
This is a notice that we’re making changes in 3.3.5 in attempts to break the ability for the AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) mod to continue functioning.<br />
<br />
We’re making this change for two reasons.<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
The second reason is that it removes too much player reaction and decision-making while facing dungeon and raid encounters. While some other mods also work to this end, we find that AVR and the act of visualizing strategy within the game world simply goes beyond what we’re willing to allow.<br />
<br />
Essentially saying that they don't like people seeing too much information in an easy to use visual format. Odd considering those pointy arrow type dealies in some addons also tell you where to go.</div></div><hr />

Answer: you can't without seriously messing up the functionality of countless other addons, unlike the AVR situation where presumably they're making instance coordinates inaccessible to addons again, which pretty much only affects AVR. In any case, the people with bad gear would just go back to being rejected through armory rather than gearscore even if that addon was removed.<br />

No, it doesn't. Those arrows that appear using DBM don't adjust their direction based on pitch or camera angle. The things AVR puts on the screen, however, do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I think the point is that there is a visual information in the 3D world. Not how the data is gathered. You could make DBM update the arrow more often so it would be the same as in AVR.</div></div><hr />

So or bubble of yell or a red circle is same.<br />

AVR....see a circle of range<br />

That's kinda the point people are trying to get across to the AVR fans. I couldn't care one way or the other about the addon, but ignorantly comparing two addons that use massively different function calls just erks me.

AVRE is a glorified range checker. It also puts coloured circled around people, which is just about the same as marking them.<br />
<br />
I think that bossmods make this game a lot easier as AVR does. On a lot of fights AVRE doesn't even do anything note-worthy. It doesn't tell you when something bad is going to happen, it doesn't scream alarming sounds when you need to move really quickly.<br />
<br />
AVR is like having a second monitor with a screenshot of the position tactics of your current boss fight. AVRE is having a ranged check that actually works by looking at the game, rather then looking at 5-10 moving bars.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prag</div><div class="date">2010-05-21, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you read the blue post? No, seriously. Did you? If you need, I'll repost the relevant parts here.<br />
<br />
This is a notice that we’re making changes in 3.3.5 in attempts to break the ability for the AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) mod to continue functioning.<br />
<br />
We’re making this change for two reasons.<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
The second reason is that it removes too much player reaction and decision-making while facing dungeon and raid encounters. While some other mods also work to this end, we find that AVR and the act of visualizing strategy within the game world simply goes beyond what we’re willing to allow.<br />
<br />
Essentially saying that they don't like people seeing too much information in an easy to use visual format. Odd considering those pointy arrow type dealies in some addons also tell you where to go. <br />
<br />
<br />
If the arrows cross the 3D space that AVR does, they should be disabled.<br />
<br />
Also, I like how you &lt;snip&gt; out the first part. Clever way to make your point. No, seriously. <br />
<br />
I don't need to be directed where to go. Forming a strategy within my Guild is really all that's left of the fun in Raiding these days. If DBM is guilty of that, then I've somehow managed to use it this entire expansion without that portion being enabled. <br />
<br />
All you can see on my DBM bars are timers. I use them because I'm a Tank and, because of encounter design this expansion, not using a CD to correlate with a Boss ability (i,e Soul Reaper) has devastating results.<br />
<br />
If you want to take issue with the fact that Boss Timers are required at least for Tanks/Healers, then take it up with Blizzard. They're the ones who let our gear scale so fast and so well that they have to make bosses hit for 60k in a single ability. Without a CD of some sort, no Tank will survive it. Period. <br />
<br />
Now, back to making excuses as to why you need pretty green circles to tell you to run left or right. Go ahead, make more excuses smart ass. Quote more Blizzard posts while clipping out the most important part (You know, where they state that interference with the 3D world from ANY addon has NEVER been allowed). <br />
<br />
No, seriously.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiki420</div><div class="date">2010-05-21, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gearscore will not go away because there is nothing wrong with it, nor does it go against any addon rules, and is based/calculated off of a number system that is already in game, item level.<br />
<br />
If you dislike gearscore, it is most likely because of one of these reasons:<br />
<br />
1. You were trying to get into a raid you weren't geared for. Shame on you. Do more heroics or Pug ToC 25. Someone asking for a high gs(5000+) for ToC? See #2.<br />
<br />
2. Some idiot is asking for a score way higher than needed. Make your own raid. If you can't be asked to do that you are acting 'lazy' in a video game. There are usually plenty of people in the raid that have been there countless times who know what to do when, so having to manage the raid shouldn't be an issue had you been through the encounters a few times. Pugs are not there to teach you the fights, and flaming the guy in trade makes you look like a whining child.<br />
<br />
3. Someone thinks an item is a direct upgrade on gearscore alone. Blame/inform the player, or find someone who knows their class well enough to make upgrade decisions through other means. New to the game? Don't PuG, find a guild. It's understandable that a new player would want to use gearscore for upgrades, but it's the job of the community/guild to point that player in the right direction for finding information. They should be expected to read and study their character, but it isn't always super easy to find said information, again, especially for someone new to the game.<br />
<br />
4. Someone is forming a raid based solely on gearscore. This is no different from TBC or Vanilla, except they were asking for different things that could be easily attained through gear; such as Bonus Heals, Max HP, or DPS. The latter being unprovable to this day aside from just bringing them and finding out first hand. When you guys have a formula for figuring out how fast a person reacts, their connection speed, and how well they perform in a fight, tell Boub so he can put it on the front page. Elitist group is close, but is also another addon that should be used in addition with gearscore.<br />
<br />
5. Any idiot can get a high gearscore. While this is true to an extent, if you do not have the gear, you will not progress far into the instance. I will take anyone over 5k gs into ICC Normal 10/25. With the added 15% buff, gearscore requirements should be going down. If you see someone asking for 5.5k GS+ they are usually looking for people who are geared enough to clear a bit in one night (as pugs rarely continue on another day,) which can be achieved easiest by... having higher itemized gear. ::)<br />
<br />
It is an awesome tool and has saved me countless minutes forming raid groups, successful raid groups. Not to mention the added /gs command that let's you browse their gear, which will tell you which spec their gear is currently best for.<br />
<br />
Or just use it AND elitist group like I do (shows gems/enchants/gear type and if it fits their spec, was on MMO-Champs front page a while back.)<br />
<br />
Don't blame the addon, blame those who abuse it on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
(And if I have missed a point of argument please bring it up, but be legible and constructive if you could, QQing/Raging gets no one anywhere.)</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that it was drawing shapes on the 2D UI plane in such a way to make them &quot;look&quot; like there are in the 3d world. Now if it is drawing in the real 3d world, then yep, break it. All of the normal AVR (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) does nothing to the &quot;real&quot; world simply draws a calculated picture in front of it, and tends to be very CPU intensive. As for telling you where/how far to move, DXE does something like that, with the arrows. Determine vector to malible goo target, find distance, if less than X, point arrow in directly away from the person. Same thing for spores on Festergut. DnD on deathwhisper, I'm sure you could make it do it for boiling blood. All AVR was doing different was drawing shapes instead of arrows. I would like bliz to publish a list of allowed actions for boss mods(or ban them and add something to the stock game), not a list of <br />
<br />
For those against AVR, turn particle effects all the way down, and disable projected textures, and then let me know how easy it is to see things on the floor. I think blizzard needs to fix that. All video settings should provide enough info to play the game. If you need &quot;projected textures&quot; to see boss effects, just force enable it, and up the minimum requirements, or change the way things like DnD work.</div></div><hr />

For example, there is a OH in HoR-H that is BiS for spriests, good luck telling that to the pug leader getting an ICC25 together. It's also an issue for other classes/specs that &quot;have&quot; to use lower ilvl gear, to min/max. Sure you could make an argument about the stam on higher ilvl gear, but tell me this, is any unavoidable dmg going to one shot me? yet most will still 2 shot me even with the extra stam; I will still need topping off the same amount regardless. so yes, GS doesn't mean you can play. or that you can avoid the fire. It is a nice, quick, way to get a rough idea of gear though. The mage with a 1800 wow-heroes GS should not come to ICC, even if he is the best mage in the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He doesn't understand coding? No, drawing circles on the screen is not the same as splashing text. It is, however, exactly the same as drawing a dialog box. There are extra libraries on top of the basic drawing libraries to make it easier to draw dialog boxes, but those higher level libraries call the lower level drawing libraries. AVR simply accesses the lower level drawing libraries, while other addons use the higher level dialog libraries. Removing access to the low level library will break the high level library, unless they do something fancy to allow high level libraries to access low level ones, but not user generated code. That sounds like a pain, if it's not impossible (hard to say without knowing how Blizz implemented the addon libraries). <br />
<br />
On the other hand, disabling the player location function will break *a lot* of addons too. More than the OP realizes, I think. Map addons, DBM and Bigwig's range check, quest helpers, all kinds of stuff. Someone mentioned disabling some of the camera functions and that makes a lot more sense.</div></div><hr />

Yet again.... There is nothing wrong with GS. It's the players that abuse its purpose that you're really angry at. Same players did gear checks, Armory checks, DPS checks, etc before GS.<br />

<br />
After using DXE for an extensive period of time on multiple encounters you will realise that you shouldn't really trust those arrows since more often than not they're very very inaccurate and the safe distance they visualize is completely wrong on every encounter.<br />
<br />
I've got arrows turned off on DXE for exactly those reasons.<br />
<br />
And to all those people complaining about AVR being broken but not DXE/DBM/BW: I dare you to even attempt a LK 25m hc kill without cooldowns on the abilities. Enjoy wiping till the end of time. You don't need a mod to tell you where to move or what cooldown to use (just hypothetically), just that you have to move and that a cooldown may be needed when an ability comes off cd.<br />
<br />
Especially with the LK 25 hc example: You cannot kill him without throwing cooldowns at the tank getting Soul Reaper each time. And in order to throw a cooldown at your tank for him to survive you need to know when said ability becomes available for use to the LK.</div></div><hr />

I love people that can't tell the difference of a DBM and AVR mechanic.Actually that is not what AVR does. If you are talking about fire that can spawn somewhere and you need to move away from it, this is how it will go:<br />
<br />
DBM:<br />
- Fire spell countdown<br />
- Big warning sound when firespell is cast<br />
- Even bigger warning when you are standing in the fire<br />
<br />
AVR:<br />
- Nothing, because AVR does not draw anything automatically.<br />
<br />
AVRE:<br />
- Probably nothing either, no point in painting a red circle beneath a fire.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how big bad flashing screed of Doom that yells &quot;don't stand in green fire!&quot; is not altering environment.<br />
<br />
The truth is, most boss encounters are both poorly designed and visualized. Take LK for example: instead of visualizing defile cast, the LK silently targets you and BLAM, after 2 sec a pool of black mud appears. This design implies you have a mod that will /y defile_on_me and show you what? Right, the big bad flashing screed of Doom. That is, designing encounters with bossmods in mind at its worst.<br />

I won't miss the avrE, but it was really handy to use avr to explain tacs. No silly <br />

<br />
<br />
Maybe, just maybe, it's because they cannot break GearScore. Players will always find new ways of ranking gear. So instead of throwing time at breaking something that will instantly come back they can just leave it be and do other stuff.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prag</div><div class="date">2010-05-21, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After using DXE for an extensive period of time on multiple encounters you will realise that you shouldn't really trust those arrows since more often than not they're very very inaccurate and the safe distance they visualize is completely wrong on every encounter.<br />
<br />
I've got arrows turned off on DXE for exactly those reasons.<br />
<br />
And to all those people complaining about AVR being broken but not DXE/DBM/BW: I dare you to even attempt a LK 25m hc kill without cooldowns on the abilities. Enjoy wiping till the end of time. You don't need a mod to tell you where to move or what cooldown to use (just hypothetically), just that you have to move and that a cooldown may be needed when an ability comes off cd.<br />
<br />
Especially with the LK 25 hc example: You cannot kill him without throwing cooldowns at the tank getting Soul Reaper each time. And in order to throw a cooldown at your tank for him to survive you need to know when said ability becomes available for use to the LK.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm so glad I'm not the only one thinking of more than just DPS with addons like DBM.<br />
<br />
It's really a shame that the people arguing the relevance between the two don't know enough about the encounters to realize that you Will. Not. Survive. Them. without knowing the abilities. <br />
<br />
Sort of reinforces the fact that, even with AVR/E, these people were still your typical tunnel-vision'd DPS that stand in Void Zones. <br />
<br />
My biggest beef with AVR/E (and I made a post when it was focused on front page the first time) is that it just caters to people who don't review strats prior to the first pull. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's cool. We'll just load up this here addon and it'll tell me where to go.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2010-05-21, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can understand AVR/AVRE being broken. It's not like DBM that simply tells you you're standing in the fire. Besides, even the default UI now has pop-up warnings, DBM just makes it easier to see them. <br />
<br />
On a side note, I'm seeing a lot of people saying that GearScore(GS) needs to be broken. This confuses me for several reasons. Every item has an ilvl. Even without factoring in spec, gems, enchants, etc, your gear will still have an average and total ilvl score, or more commonly known as &quot;gear score&quot;. They added the ilvl to the tooltips on gear several patches ago, so the only way you could &quot;break&quot; GS would be to remove that particular bit of information from being accessed. Blizzard is not known for removing functionality after it's been implemented (they've done it, but it's extremely rare). Also, even if they removed access to the ilvl information, coders would still be able to &quot;assign&quot; a value to the item, thus keeping the GS addon alive.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that confuses me about the people saying it needs to be broken is why you're mad at the addon and not the morons that abuse its purpose. As plenty have said everywhere else, before GS there was Armory, before Armory there was /inspect and before people widely used /inspect there was DamageMeters, Recount and other methods of measuring people.<br />
<br />
/end_soapbox<br />
<br />
<br />
I completely second this.<br />
<br />
I just can't fathom why people rage against gearscore instead of stupid morons who think you need 5,5k GS for trial of the (not grand) crusader and the likes. <br />
<br />
Not taking that random guy with 3,5k GS into your random ICC raid is perfectly valid - and gearscore just saved you a few minutes of checking his armory there.<br />
Not taking that random guy with 5,2k GS into your random ICC raid because you only want people with 5,5k GS is completely retarded though.<br />
<br />
I've seen DPS with 5,8k GS (the worst example, a fury warrior with 2 best in slot trinkets, 2x Bryntroll the Bone arbiter and other sweet items) doing 5k DPS on 25man nonheroic festergut. <br />
I've also seen DPS with 5,0k GS do 8k DPS on the same fight.<br />
<br />
Which player would you rather want? The 8k DPS guy of course. But moronic pug leaders would take the 5,8k GS guy without a doubt.<br />
<br />
People arguing that Blizz should ban GS should at the same time be arguing that Blizz disables seeing other peoples health. Because when a tank has under 40k Health for a TOC25 raid he usually gets booted from the raid.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: Can't ban stupid. Well you could, but stupid still pays his subscription.</div></div><hr />

Expect more incoming censorship from blizzard now when it comes to addons. I would also expect things like power auras to break if blizzard is trying to break AVR because they both work on the same principle.<br />
<br />
[edit] For all those skeptics and haters of AVR, check it out DL it for 1 raid and see what it really is before its gone, so you can understand why this potential censorship worries some addon designers and lovers.</div></div><hr />

I like this guy. Blizzard should better visualise and not overpaint the raider's screen.<br />
Also tools to explain wtf2do in game are pretty much limited. Tbh last time i actually learned from encounter itself was in vanilla, since then there are too many players inclining to &quot;we one shot this boss or i leave&quot; and the requiments for that is you watch boss tactic x times on youtube, you read y articles instead of, hey, the fire under you is burning, get out, you are taking too much dmg when standing near this guy ...<br />

There used to be a mod that allowed you to draw on the map just like AVR to help teach and show how encounters worked but I would have to assume that it will be broken as well come next patch</div></div><hr />

<br />
GearScore is just a souped-up version of adding gear ilevels of all your gear (to put it simply). Blizzard provides ilevels of all gear in the game. Besides, all GS does is help raid leaders build pugs more quickly because they don't have to alt-tab to WoW Heroes or some other web-based gear checker website ... or manually inspect every piece of gear on you in the game.<br />
<br />
Sure if GS were banned it'd cut down on the craziness of requiring absurd gearscores for all the various raids and other activities, because many people would be too lazy to manually inspect or alt-tab, but it wouldn't eliminate gear-checking.</div></div><hr />

As a returning player, starting over in the game, I haven't leveled a toon high enough to raid in the last 2 weeks yet. So I haven't even got to use AVR and was fascinated when I saw the mod on WoWinterface. It's sad to see it go before I have a chance to use it, since it seems interesting.<br />
<br />
I think that it it good for people who have a bad memory, or who have a bad concept of space and time. And even for people who are a little &quot;slow&quot;, either because they are mentally retarded or have some other disability. I, for example, have Fibromyalgia- so sometimes I am a bit hurp durp durp. Especially because of my medication (Neurontin) that makes me a little hurr durr at times.</div></div><hr />

That statement kinda contradicts the fact that you obviously use AVRE. Claiming it is no different is admitting ignorance and to some extend stupidity.<br />
<br />
A mod telling you where to move when is completely different from a mod telling you to move full stop. The former requires you to play connect the dots for 5 year olds and the latter actually requires you to use half a brain.<br />
<br />
And yes, with this I ackowledge that WoW only requires half a brain to play well. Also one of the reasons I cannot comprehend how bad some players are. Some players are serious cases of &quot;How the fuck does that guy make it through life?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's not an interesting mod though. It turns your players into mindless zombies that the moment the mod fails have no comprehension of what's going on.<br />
That's the reason we banned it from use in our guild. Any guild that encourages the use of this mod will never have decent enough players to tackle all the challenges in the game.<br />
<br />
It turns easy content into brainless farming and sucks all the fun out of encounters. Other than completely ruining the scenery of course.<br />
<br />
I'm glad this mod is being shut down. Maybe the average skill level in the playerbase will rise again now that people actually have to think again.</div></div><hr />

you obviously have no idea how the addon works or how it comes out of the box, Even with AVRE in not a single fight does it show you where to stand. It may show you where not to stand in some cases just like you said tells you to &quot;full stop&quot;. Also By knee jerk reaction I mean this addon has only existed for a month or so, the addon hasn't even had time to show any effect on wow. The addon hasn't had time to really integrate into the community.</div></div><hr />

LOL some people would think you have no choice and that the author held a sausage to your cheek and slapped you until you installed it.<br />
<br />
Was AVRE utterly pointless and braindead? YES!<br />
Was AVR? HELL NO!<br />
<br />
Sorry that some gimps cant comprehend how a tool can be used for effective planning. Remember back in the day a raid guide was ENTIRELY a picture of the boss room and MS Painted lines/circles drawn on top? Hmm yeah funny how those weren't for noobs yet AVR is.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see nothing will actually stop such a mod from working aside from a total clampdown of all mathmetic functions. seeing as how thousands of mods need to do math to work, blizz isnt going to do that. If you have ANY basic comprehension of math then you will know why they practically either disable modding full stop, or it will stay around.<br />
<br />
You hardly need any data at all to start working out some values when you are good at math (like the AVR guy).<br />
<br />
Seems to me that a simplified version of this tool would be amazing, just disable it im combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
