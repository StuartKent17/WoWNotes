Player vs. Player<br />
Unrated Battlegrounds<br />
Unrated BGs aren't going away. In fact, you'll have access to slightly more than you did in the past even just through unrated bgs. So, it should continue to be a great way to spend 30-40 minutes when you don't have time to organize with others. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/19595519472-blizzard-ideology-is-flawed-re-rated-bgs.html))<br />
<br />
Arena System<br />
Arenas are very effectively serving exactly the purpose they were created for. The arena system might be failing to provide you personally with good gear, but the system itself continues to be successful. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/19595519472-blizzard-ideology-is-flawed-re-rated-bgs.html))<br />
<br />
No PvP Weapons available for Honor points<br />
...because we make the assumption that since WoW was engaging enough for 80 levels of play to get to the scenario you mention that most people aren't actually that horribly offended by doing pve content (which is arguably the core of the game).<br />
<br />
We may need to reconsider that particular philosophy if doing heroics is indeed that unappealing to many players. Although, I'm not sure how &quot;many&quot; players that really is TBH... forums like these are a surprisingly poor way to actually figure out what percentage of players think what about a given issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/19595379811-kalgan-your-here-pvp-weapon-answer.html))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm<br />
Argent Tournament after Cataclysm<br />
One thing to keep in mind is that not everybody will be purchasing Cataclysm on day zero, so the content and stories for the previous expansion(s) needs to be there for those players as well as be there for any characters leveling up.<br />
<br />
Because of how well the Argent Tournament allows you to gain reputation with city factions, I think it will continue to be relevant. I know some people who still head to Netherwing Ledge and get their repuation/drakes because they want to do it on a new character.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking - spending a lot of time on new content and then making it end and disappear is not something we like to do and have to be very careful on when and how often we do it. We are changing some of the classic continent because they have been there for 5 years so we feel it's okay to change it around after all this time.<br />
<br />
The Onyxia example is a special circumstance for the 5 year anniversary. This isn't something we plan to do for every instance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19595069701-fate-of-the-at-designing-obsolescence.html))<br />
<br />
Goblins Models<br />
I think if you're expecting the &quot;standard green short guy&quot; to be the Goblins in Cataclysm, you're either going to be disappointed or pleasantly surprised, depending on whether you want them to be the same models as they currently are in game or not. Sure, they are not quite as different as the TBC Draenei were to the degenerate ones found in the Swamp of Sorrows before TBC launched, but they aren't purely recycled old models either.<br />
<br />
From some of the concept art, I get the impression that what we've seen of the Goblins from the BlizzCon sneak peak was just the beginning... but only time will tell! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10711091122-worgen-can-transform-why-not-goblin.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I think it's too early to say whether all current NPC goblins will also get the new models. But with the pre-TBC High Elves being updated to use Blood Elf models, one can't be too sure the same won't happen for goblins too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10711191338-grinning-goblins-a-thing-of-the-past.html))<br />
<br />
Paid Race Change and Goblins / Worgens<br />
We may add the new races to the Race Change feature, but it will probably not be something that is available immediately after Cataclysm's launch. We are putting large amounts of work into the flow and feel of leveling in the new expansion. Thus, we would be doing many players a disservice by allowing Race Changes to circumvent the leveling process early on in the expansions natural life cycle. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19595520172-ok-im-confused-on-the-whole-race-changing.html))<br />

Leveling as Balance<br />
We are aware that a lot of things in the original continents need some changes and this is part of what brought around the plans for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
I leveled as a Boom (or pew pew) kin and ended up using cloth almost the whole way. It doesn't affect the leveling too much though as I was rarely in a situation where a little extra armor would bail me out - whenever I died I was pretty much way in over my head.

So mid rankers will still always have 80 less resilience (or weaker stats if they gem for the res) than those with s5 weapons/off-hands and get faceplam back when they get close to the rank for weapons. :(<br />
<br />
EDIT: I mean its fine for no walfare pvp weapons when a new expension just come out, but now its unfair to those without the last season weapons and facing someone who have.<br />
<br />
AND what about the pvp relics and totems? So, hardcore pve players will still have to grind honor do well in arena to get the best &quot;flash heal&quot; relic/totem.</div></div><hr />

Not sure is it true as well for US/EU servers but S6 have just ended and I dont see much Ulduar hard mode weapons used in the high brackets, esp. for caster and healers.<br />
<br />
Ulduar hard weapons tends to have too much &quot;useless&quot; spirit and less spell power than s6 weapons, while normal 25man weapon have lower spell power than s5.<br />

<br />
I think it's more about the faces and facial appearance than the physique of the Goblins... doubt the majority of players would want to see 500 Gadgetzan Bruisers running around on The Lost Isles during release...<br />
<br />
As for the Worgen/Goblin race change it's a bit stupid that they're saying &quot;we may&quot;, cause obviously they'd have to add them eventually... At the very beginning wouldn't be very probable though, and thank god for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're a moron. While PvE weapons do have more offensive stats than PvP weapons even with arena being the only place to get PvP weapons they are still much easier to get for a PvPer that is new than for a raider that is new. No one runs old content anymore unless its in some sort of a fail pug, and the stats on the new arena season weapons far outweigh the weapons in Uludar even in offensive stats. Welfare epics was a much needed system that was abused because while it allowed some people to prosper unfairly it still managed to give people a leg up if they came late to the party or GOD FORBID left the party for a little while and everyone else in the party moved on without them. Blizzard has done a failure job at letting people that have lives keep up with people that don't, and that was a little better in TBC with badges of justice and last seasons gear being purchasable with honor. If they don't get back to that they have will have a problem alienating players. Right now, it seems easier to just come back for the next expansion if you take a break in the game then to try to catch up, and that means if someone needs to take a break between patches they might as well wait 2 years to play the game again. That doesn't go well for the player base or for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Self-esteem issues mostly. People like this I feel bad for. They seek methods to cause others stress/pain to help take their mind off their own. They might not be as bad IRL but its hard to say, the internet provides a buffer zone removing responsibility for their actions, allowing them to live out their inner anger.<br />

While PvE weapons do have more offensive stats than PvP weapons even with arena being the only place to get PvP weapons they are still much easier to get for a PvPer that is new than for a raider that is new. No one runs old content anymore unless its in some sort of a fail pug, and the stats on the new arena season weapons far outweigh the weapons in Uludar even in offensive stats. Welfare epics was a much needed system that was abused because while it allowed some people to prosper unfairly it still managed to give people a leg up if they came late to the party or GOD FORBID left the party for a little while and everyone else in the party moved on without them. Blizzard has done a failure job at letting people that have lives keep up with people that don't, and that was a little better in TBC with badges of justice and last seasons gear being purchasable with honor. If they don't get back to that they have will have a problem alienating players. Right now, it seems easier to just come back for the next expansion if you take a break in the game then to try to catch up, and that means if someone needs to take a break between patches they might as well wait 2 years to play the game again. That doesn't go well for the player base or for Blizzard.<br />

I said practically the same thing in LK beta when they made the changes to BGs/Arenas.<br />

...because we make the assumption that since WoW was engaging enough for 80 levels of play to get to the scenario you mention that most people aren't actually that horribly offended by doing pve content (which is arguably the core of the game).<br />

And there it is. Whenever there is an argument about PvP just being a sidegame/minigame and WoW is a PvE game, just shove this in their face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said, doing it once would be funny as hell, doing it repeatedly would be pretty sad and pathetic. I can't help to laugh, and I might be upset about it when it happened, but I would laugh about it later. I would compare what this dude did to the mage portals that get opened on the portal to WG from Dalaran. Both are annoying at first, but both are also funny as hell afterward. Hell, it also creates memories. I remember very little in this game compared to when I was grinding WG for the helm that has hit rating on it and got ported to Theramore. It pissed me off at the time, but I laugh about it now. Some people just take this game way to seriously and need to learn to laugh more.</div></div><hr />

Actually, arenas just heighten the class imbalances in this game and after constant nerfs and buffs that just centered around arenas they are still the least popular part of the game, and only about 10% of people actually do them. When you are buffing and nerfing classes based on an aspect of it that is not a major part of it and only affects 10% of the people then something is completely wrong. Also, even with all these buffs and nerfs its quite obvious that the class balance still hasn't evened out.

The moment you arrive you're asked to install a plugin you know nothing about and then the page hangs while it tries to load the streaming content. What ever happened to links?<br />
<br />
<br />
I know it sucks, but here's a quick workaround, if you have GreaseMonkey (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/) and a script that's used on every page, like Linkify (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1352):<br />
<br />
if(t=document.getElementById(&quot;gametime&quot;)) t.parentNode.removeChild(t)<br />
if(t=document.getElementById(&quot;octopv_stuffDiv&quot;)) t.parentNode.removeChild(t)<br />
In the case of the Linkify script, add these lines after <br />
(function(){ try {<br />
(since that stream stuff is added through a script, it needs to be executed after the page is loaded)<br />
<br />
The stream may appear shortly, but are removed when the page finishes loading. The second line removes the overlay &quot;Do you want to install this annoying plugin?&quot; that may have come up already. (Try it without that second line, it gets even worse...)</div></div><hr />

Stupidly pointless comment, and the thing is you pulled it from somewhere else. If I'm wrong then prove I'm wrong. Show me where more than 1.1 million people even bother with arena. Its not a made up statistic. Its generally accepted, and even Blizzard has said that much fewer players are doing arena in WoTLK than that did in TBC and less than 1/3 actually bothered with them in TBC. Just because you are having fun with arenas (assuming you are), don't assume everyone else is.</div></div><hr />

You should be running flash blocker anyways. You see, the problem with flash it that it is INCREDIBLY not secure, and you basically have two choices to counteract that. You can either use flash blocker to keep things from popping up that you don't want to or uninstall your flash plug in. However, lets be honest, the internet is the number one source for adult content, and that content requires flash, so most people don't uninstall their plug in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I don't think I would change my race/class combination that I have had all through TBC and all through WotLK. It just doesn't feel right to play anything other than my night elf druid. However, you might be in a minority if you are one of the people that doesn't want to level a new class just to see the new content. I'm personally looking very forward to checking out the new content although I will probably end up still playing my druid at 85. I've leveled so many alts in this game its not even funny, and it will be nice to see all the new changes. Besides, LEVELING IN WOW IS NOT HARD. I can get from 1-20 in about 10 hours. I can get from 20-80 in about 4 days played. Its not exactly rocket science, and if you switch around a lot (try different zones) its not even all that grindy. Its not like they ask you to hit a target dummy or use a skill 2,000,000 times while logged in the whole time because god forbid the process be automated (yes I'm talking about you UO and god how the games have improved since you).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And balance druids are fine, some guy over at blizzard levelled one up once some time ago, no need to worry. And honestly guys, those weapons you get from heroics are pro, you don't need good weapons to pvp, whats all the fuss about.<br />
<br />
<br />
God, you must be sarcastic here. See, the problem isn't that balance druids can't level its that the lower levels completely favor melee specced characters. It takes much less time to level in cat than in kin and that cat gets gear specifically designed for that spec/class as well as rogues, and that boomkin gets to steal all that cloth gear while the clothies bitch about it. To make things even worse, crafted leather and quested leather are ridiculous. The good pieces require someone to farm for a month (exaggeration) to get the recipe to drop. <br />
<br />
What they need to do is make all old world, TBC and WotLK recipes trainable after Cataclysm comes out. They also need to work on a badge system for lower levels and they need to make items RNG but also have the same items be purchasable with badges. So, you can grind through an instance 50 times looking for a piece of loot or you can grind through one 25 times and buy that piece of loot with badges if it hasn't dropped yet.<br />
<br />
You are kidding yourself if you think a rogue with duel relentless daggers isn't 100% more powerful than one with rare/epic (of the crap daggers) that drop in heroics. Of course, in WG and even battlegrounds this makes little difference. In arena, however, this is part of the flawed system that doesn't allow new teams in after the first season because the learning curve is way to high and for them to actually make a decent gear matching system in arenas the queues would take at least a week.</div></div><hr />

You have to be kidding me if you think Uludar hard mode and Trial of the Grand Crusader are like candy. Its nice you are that incredibly powerful and so is your guild that you have Uludar hard modes and Alagon on farm and will have TOC on farm and will have no problems with heroic TOGC. Good for you. That is great.<br />
<br />
Assuming you are not one of those people and one of those guilds (like the vast majority of the players this game are not either) then stop talking out of your arse.</div></div><hr />

What post? After my post on the bug report forum, people were using that method to get insta-rank 2 on every server.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fix came on the 27th, while your videos were made back in early August. Also on your video you yourself claim that the rank exploit was fixed back before the 18th.The fix to ranking before the battle starts WAS fixed on the day I commented on my YouTube videos. Its the one vehicle per 2 minutes thing that was changed (I don't consider it a fix) on the 27th. Obviously Blizzard didn't like either of them, but the ranking before the battle starts thing was easier to change (fix). My video clearly shows me pointlessly making an obscene number of Siege Engines with my ill-gotten rank 2 and Blizzard clearly saw it 1) on the day my thread in the bug report forum got a blue post and 2) the day &quot;inspector.corp.blizzard.net&quot; started watching the YouTube videos, as shown on the statistics page.<br />
<br />
Face it, I twice caused Bliz to balance WG, both well before whatever you started doing or posted about on the 23rd.</div></div><hr />
