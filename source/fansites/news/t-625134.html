Dual-spec switching<br />
When they are actually in the game we'll have more details for you, but the idea is that you'll be able to switch between two specs much easier than porting to a home city, resetting talents, clicking a whole bunch, and setting up the new abilities on your action bars.<br />
<br />
Simplifying mana regeneration stats<br />
This is something that is totally on our radar. Mana regen requires looking at a lot of different numbers and we'd like to simplify it, without losing any of the interesting gear options that players have. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129077831-please-simplify-mana-stats.html))<br />
<br />
Ooooh, it'll reset the action bars too? <br />
It's something that was brought up as a possibility, but it isn't a guarantee until it's in the game. I just listed the process as it is right now and we want to make things go smoother. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13129077930-how-do-dual-specs-work.html))<br />
<br />
Malygos Vortex (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56105) nerf and class diversity<br />
The Malygos Vortex is the kind of thing we have to do to challenge AE healing because otherwise groups can pretty much trivialize it. This is one of the reasons we think Wild Growth and Circle of Healing need to be nerfed. If those spells aren't so powerful, then vortex and similar moments don't have to be so intense either and we'll be able to nerf it if needed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129076593-so-gc-we-just-did-malygos.html))<br />
<br />
Gotta Go! (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1860)&quot; Achievement<br />
We're going to add some time to the completion timer in an upcoming patch so obtaining the achievement won't require the more extreme group compositions and strategies being used. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/13129153683-gotta-go-achievment.html))<br />

Druid scaling<br />
-- When you talk about scaling, you have to separate a few different issues:<br />
1) Does the class / talent / spell scale?<br />
2) Does it scale well once it has good gear?<br />
3) Does that gear actually exist?<br />
4) Is it readily available or is it hard to get?<br />
-- Some classes complain about having too many stats and others about not having enough stats. They are just different class styles. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.<br />
-- Our goal is not that every stat is useful for you.<br />
-- Our goal is not that only stats which are useful for you appear on your gear.<br />
-- One of the interesting things about resto seems to be that there is some player preference involved in how you heal. Some use Regrowth a lot now, others use Healing Touch, and others stick with rolling blooms. While it may end up that someone can prove one of those strategies sufficiently trumps the others, for now it is cool to see the experimentation.<br />
-- That said, we do worry if Nourish's niche is too narrow. We'll see. It is getting compared to heals with very good glyphs affecting them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12454677501-the-druid-dilemma-worst-healers-postnaxx.html))<br />

Holy Paladins<br />
I think it's a bit premature to declare that Holy paladins (or any healer really) can't keep up. In situations where a paladin can really benefit from Beacon, it may in fact be hard for others to keep up, but that won't be every fight.<br />
<br />
If you look at the guilds who are doing the (current) end game content, they are using a lot of Holy pallys and those guys never seem to run out of mana. So presumably there are plenty of situations where they really shine. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129067595-i-feel-a-bit-worthless--.html))<br />

Warlock Rotations<br />
We have been talking about a couple of different approaches to warlock rotations. One is to try and make more of the dots last around the same duration so you aren't watching them quite so much. Another is just to lower the standard rotation from having so many dots. These are both things we are working on but it's too early to say what the changes will end up being.

I just wanted to quote this so all the fucking idiots who are saying this feature should require us to visit a city are fucking assholes. Why piss in the mouth of a good thing? Dual specs is useful even for pure DPS classes. GO THE FUCK HOME AND STOP TRYING TO NERF DUAL SPECS. The developers know what they want and it seems to coincide with what I want. <br />
<br />
I would love for the Glyphs and Bars to switch, but as a DOMINOS user, this will probably bring many headaches into the area of bar modifications. Such is life, I lived without 'em before, I can deal again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtamori</div><div class="date">2008-12-02, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with Paladin healers have never been healing during raids for their best task. The problem has been healing outside their main task (something the other classes have no problem with at all), and above all it has been one of boredom (you CAN'T perform outside the main role).<br />
<br />
Additionally, the reason Paladins are so mana efficient is that they are limited to the single-target role, and then to perform that role they are more or less forced to use the games most efficient heal (FoL) with the occasional HL when there is a period of increased damage.<br />
<br />
The end effect is that Paladins are crippled for situations where people rely on them and only them (MGT, anyone?) when the content requires more than single-target, and bored to death when there is little timing or spell alteration during raids. Pushing two buttons isn't fun, simple as that, especially not when those two buttons do exactly the same thing.<br />
<br />
I speak from experience. A very, very, bored experience.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macalister</div><div class="date">2008-12-02, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Mahtamori says they are very good for that specific main role but less than mediocre when straying from that role.<br />
Personally I probably wouldn't get a paladin over another healing class for any instances.<br />
<br />
The druid can do what the paladin does and more, so.. yeah. hi durid.<br />
<br />
The two other specs as a paladin are fine however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am I getting that you guys would like to have homogenized classes? Perhaps we should give rogues an AOE Heal that puts everyone back up to full health? for 2 energy? And let them get a point of dodge and parry for every 5 points of agility? Then we can all just stand around and collect epics.<br />
<br />
L2 Role, you are healadins, not shaman/priests/druids. You stand in the corner and wiggle your fingers and shut up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it comes to healing, we are EXACTLY like every other class. If and only if you remove all useful spells except the fast and slow direct heal. The only difference is that the fast heal is more mana efficient.<br />
<br />
No, it's more like: take away gouge, blind, sap, shadow step, garrote, and all poisons from Rogues. Then reduce the energy cost of Sinister Strike and Eviscerate by 5. There, now you've got a Holy-Paladin-ized version of a Rogue.<br />
Now, I don't play a Rogue, so you'd probably have to remove MORE abilities to make a proper analogy. But basically, reduce the Rogue down to TWO abilities with maybe 3 highly situational ones (that are preferably on 5 minute cooldowns) and make them energy efficient.<br />

Wrong. They just said you won't HAVE to. I.E. all the melee DPS won't have to have a tank 2nd spec for a boss because the fight needs 10 tanks.<br />

<br />
It's not just aff locks. Destro and Demo have 3 DoTs they have to keep up too. As 30/0/41 I have 4 DoTs.<br />
<br />
If I don't keep them up, sure I do more DPS than an aff lock (why do you think I'm not aff), but I can't keep up with other classes without them.</div></div><hr />
