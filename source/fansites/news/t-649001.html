It looks like Blizzard is building new teams for Italian and Polish versions of the game and it wouldn't be surprising to see those languages added to World of Warcraft very soon. <br />

Blue posts<br />
[size=3]Player vs. Player<br />
Cleaves too dominant in Arenas<br />
We think cleave teams are too dominant, especially in 2s. We don't think they are as bad in 3s, but the community is very focused on 2s at the moment.<br />
<br />
We don't think it's as simple as melee classes doing too much damage or having too much armor. We don't even necessarily think it's &quot;melee&quot; because I'm not convinced shamans and druids are affected. We think it has more to do with ranged classes not always able to bring their CC or survival tools to bear against melee.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind when you are talking about Arena comps, the issue isn't as simple as saying that X beats Y. Often it's a question of who you want on your team. To take just one example, we think that last season if you were trying to decide between a hunter and warrior, the hunter brought a lot more to the table. There was no benefit to be gained from taking a warrior instead. There were a lot of reasons for this, but one of them was that physical damage just wasn't that useful and another was that warriors could never keep on a target. Another was that DKs and paladins dominated smaller brackets. In this season you can make the argument that warriors are more attractive than hunters. One of the things that a hunter could theoretically bring -- stronger CC in the form of traps -- may not be useful enough compared to say the CC you could get from a mage. This has almost nothing to do with warriors beating hunters in 1v1 duel situations and everything to do with how you want to build your team.<br />
<br />
Obviously (I hope) I am boiling down a complicated situation to a simplistic level for purposes of illustration. My point is that often, in our minds, it's rarely as simple as &quot;If my class did more damage, my class would be at 10% Arena representation.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223093070-blizzard-address-cleave-team-imbalance.html))<br />
<br />
Plate Armor vs. Cloth<br />
I think you are just looking at the armor number and assuming that translates to survivability. A lot of the damage done, some even from plate wearers, is not physical. Plate-wearers are by and large melee while cloth-wearers are by and large ranged. If you're a caster, not only are you doing ranged damage but you're punching right through the armor anyway. All the casters have spells that increase their mitigation far beyond the simple armor number on their cloth.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of the arguments you see on the forums right now about melee &gt; ranged are simplistic. The armor on plate probably has an effect, but I don't think it's the main effect. Consider the rock-paper-scissors of a generic melee class to a generic caster class. The balance is supposed to be that the caster can cause damage at range. The melee class can attempt to close to do damage, but the caster has crowd control and escape mechanisms to get away. Now consider that most of the caster crowd control and some escape mechanisms are magic, which can be dispelled, while the snares, stuns and charges from melee are often physical or can't be dispelled at all. From that POV, you could argue that dispels and Blessing of Freedom in particular, are far more destabilizing to Arena balance than just plate.

<br />
Classes<br />
DPS Stats Itemization<br />
The &quot;primary&quot; stats on dps plate are Str and Stam. The primary stats on dps leather are AP, Agi and Stam.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is because putting Str and AP on plate feels goofy -- they are virtually the same stat for plate-wearers. Putting Str, Agi and AP on plate feels bad because Agi does so little for plate-wearers.<br />
<br />
A long-term solution is probably something more like itemizing leather with just Agi and Stam, but making sure leather-wearers get enough out of Agi that losing the AP isn't a nerf. The alternative is to make Agi a good state for plate-wearers. We traditionally haven't done that because plate-wearers &quot;feel&quot; like they should be strong, not agile. But that feel may have to lose to making the plate v. leater disparity itself feel better in the long run.<br />
<br />
Again, long-term. We're not going to hotfix thousands of items. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223042982-dear-blizzard-plate-armor.html))<br />
<br />
Importance of AoE Damage in WotLK<br />
Our older design was that warlocks and mages were the kinds of AOE. We've backed off that because it's just not a very fun niche. To be &quot;the best&quot; at something implies you're second best at other things. If that is not the case, then mage and warlock are just the best damage classes because they are tied for everything while also being the best at one thing. So then the design needs to become something unsatisfying like mages and locks are the best at AE, but not as good at single-target, or not as good at staying alive, or not as good on long fights. That technically gives everyone a role, but we found it wasn't a fun role for the mages and locks.<br />
<br />
Our LK design is that single-target dps matters the most, because that's the most important to players, and things like AE, crowd-control, survivability, etc. are all &quot;good enough&quot; for everyone. There isn't a &quot;best at AE&quot; -- it's just something all classes do. You don't park the rogue when you have a high AE fight and you don't park the mage when you have a high single-target fight. AE matters on almost all of the Ulduar fights to some degree, but single-target dps still probably matters more.

Glyph of Icebound Fortitude Bug<br />
The glyph was supposed to give you a stronger IBF as if you had high defense. This made it more of a PVP glyph since tanking DKs already should have high defense. Therefore the glyph was supposed to do nothing for them.<br />
<br />
The bug was that it did increase their IBF even at high defense. This turned the glyph from a PvP glyph into a mandatory tanking glyph, and probably an overpowered one at that. I believe the hotfix has gone live already. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17163477544-glyph-of-icebound-fortitude-bug.html))<br />

Druid Weapon Upgrades in Ulduar<br />
We want to get out of the business of needing to offer 2 types of weapon for a single tree of one class, given that we already have to itemize Balance and Resto druids somewhat differently. It is just not our design to make two-handed tanking weapons, and we have attempted to design DKs and druids so that they don't need them.<br />
<br />
The classes and spec have grown so divergent that even with Ulduar offering something like 800 items (which to be fair, counts 10 vs. 25 and normal vs. hard) some players still feel like we aren't filling their niche. We don't want to have to offer 1000 or more PvE items in one patch, so we need to handle things at the class level so that there is less of a need for those items.<br />
<br />
If you want to focus on tanking as a Feral instead of dps, you should do that mostly through talents, gems, enchants and the jewelry and cloak pieces. We have fit two fairly different roles into the Feral tree and you can even hybridize them to a degree, but we want to stop short of having to itemize the druid as four classes.

Totem-Stomping Macros<br />
Blizzard does not like the gameplay of totem-stopping macros and we intend to stop it. Destroying a totem should be a viable strategy but it should be a choice and require some effort on the part of the destroyer. Making a macro to have your pet attack the totem without having to target the totem first does not in our minds constitute enough effort.<br />
<br />
This will require a technical change that we don't have in place yet. We will announce when we are making that change when we know for sure that the change is going live. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223043118-design-intent-on-totemstomping-macros.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason the said players would get own language realms is because they're pretty much a plague to any non-speakers of those languages, on their home realms.<br />
<br />
I have no experience with the Italians, but my battlegroup got a heavy amount of polish players, who sadly, don't understand a brick of English. Realms such as Crushridge and Dunemaul is completely deserted for any English speaking players.<br />
<br />
It's a sad evolution, and I'm disappointed with the WoW communities in the said countries. <br />
<br />
And from a real life perspective, I'm disappointed with Poland. There's no hope for a serious rebuild of the countries economy if they refuse to learn other languages, and avoid any form of internalization.<br />
<br />
Italy don't surprise me though, they always been like that in culture. Reminds me of the French, thehehe ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL @ THAT. I mean, it's as if Blizzard doesn't care that spirit is a terrible stat for balance druids. They've put gobs of spirit all over ALL Ulduar leather pieces, including T8 set pieces.<br />
<br />
To put things in perspective, raiding moonkins typically have 0/3 dreamstate (intellect into mp5) and 0/3 intensity (spirit into in-combat mana regen). All spirit does is passively give 15% (30% after patch) of spirit into spellpower. Whoopteedoo.<br />
<br />
I'm glad they're finally realizing that Balance and Resto need to be itemized SOMEWHAT differently /sarcasm ::)</div></div><hr />

This is Blizz-speak for: &quot;Designing fights that are fun for different types of damage dealers is hard. We'll rather remove variety from the game than spend the resources necessary to design interesting fights.&quot;<br />

<br />
It seems like Blizzard is systematically going through the game and removing all the things that brought variety and made different play-styles, roles and classes unique. It's only a matter of time before they decide that tanking or healing isn't a &quot;fun role&quot; and make it &quot;something all classes do&quot;.</div></div><hr />

There is a pretty big polish community on some realms. I think one of the biggest is Burning Legion. <br />

Greetings for you too my polish friend :)<br />
<br />
Well, I just woke up. Those news made me lol hardly. I never expected from blizzard to make polish support/polish web site/even polish server. By my opinion there is not many poland players playing wow. <br />
<br />
Someone up here've written that Swedish ppl know english good ect- and agreed that Poland isn't bad choise. I can't imagine somebody playing in WoW without english speaking community and other. If you are playing WoW you must to know english language.<br />
<br />
I agree that they should make swe on hun support site + server instead ( Gief less ppl spamming on my server &quot;hai swe?&quot; &quot;hai hun?&quot;) or just allow polish people to take part in all conests.<br />
<br />
Thanks Blizzard for this nice suprise, and thanks mmo-champion for news :)<br />

The reason for this is because putting Str and AP on plate feels goofy -- they are virtually the same stat for plate-wearers. Putting Str, Agi and AP on plate feels bad because Agi does so little for plate-wearers.<br />

Would it not be possible to make the &quot;primary&quot; stats for dps plate, Str, Stam and Crit ? Str = AP, Agi = Crit. Why not give Plate DPS pure crit and Str, just as Leather DPS gets pure AP and Agi. I suspect the high amount of crit (and agi) on leather gear is what makes a lot of plate dps classes roll on leather gear.<br />

EDIT: Apparently Silverbreeze had the same idea :)</div></div><hr />

So thx blizzard for taking care about Polish ppl atlast and making for them Customer Support. :)</div></div><hr />

Tbh it comes as a surprise to me. Being a Polish player myself I have noticed that my fellow guildies as well as vast majority of other Poles , can at least understand most of WoW terms ,what's going on bg at a given time(chat) or in the party while doing instances. While I am well aware of the fact that many of us just play the game within only Polish guilds and with their (mostly) IRL friends, I am pretty sure that it is a minority.<br />
<br />
Those who doesn't have a clue what's going on, just roll on Burning Legion (EU) and enjoy playing with huge community of Polish players. <br />
<br />
Coming back to the subject.I don't think that Blizz is going to make any Polish realms ,translate any quests whatsoever and stuff. The reason is simple- the demand for it , is not enough to make it happen. They will just find some people for technical help for Poles and that will be it.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, what makes me happy is that maybe at last Polish players will be treated like the majority of WoW players in Europe and we will be able to take part in services like Recruit a Friend or other things we are now excluded from.<br />

That made my day mate. I don't think that u realize how many polish ppl speak english, and there is plenty of them, but how could You know, if they speak in english already? You have no rights to tell me and other polish ppl to learn english language bcoz your smart ass doesnt want to learn anything else. There is 1000x more polish ppl who can speak perfect english, than english ppl who can speak ANY other foreign language, so good luck and stop spamming your racist post about foreign countries. <br />
<br />
Think for yourself.<br />
<br />
From the other hand, I do believe that there is plenty of Polish and Italian players out there and creating few servers for them will be great. Community of both countries is big enough to be noticed, on my realm there is plenty of polish guilds, I play in one by myself. There is at least 4-5 that is already clearing ulduar and a lot of polish ppl that play just casualy.<br />

<br />
Btw....good coming for the rest of the peeps :D<br />
<br />
I come from Runetotem and I know many Italians there - questionable ones and someone's better - but i can figure out how could a full Ita server could be and just thinking on it makes me rofl since now...<br />

A lot of the damage done, some even from plate wearers, is not physical.<br />
Also a lot of the damage done, especially from plate wearers, is physical. That means plate &gt; cloth, what a surprise. Whether damage its physical or not, cloth wearers have to worry about both. <br />
<br />
All the casters have spells that increase their mitigation far beyond the simple armor number on their cloth.<br />
Too bad melee has skills that increase their mitigation far beyond the simple armor number on their plate as well. Melee has strong survivability. Just take a look at pala &amp; dk and what not and think again.<br />
<br />
<br />
The balance is supposed to be that the caster can cause damage at range. The melee class can attempt to close to do damage, but the caster has crowd control and escape mechanisms to get away.<br />
supposed to be but in reality the most casters don't get away and get simply destroyed by melee. With the amount of casters that rely on cast time on their spells it is impossible to get a cast off while having someone chain cc/stun/silence you. All casters are not mages and don't have the escape tools or kiting abilities to help get away from melee. You can easily exploit wow &quot;balance&quot; by rolling a melee class like pala(ret),dk or roque and watch your skill increase rapidly.</div></div><hr />

When blizz announced that htere will be a russian localization, every russian out there screamed that there is no way that they would transfer there. And now what? Some of the russian servers are overcrowded, and many still have a large popularity. And blizz had to open many new servers to make spots for everyone. So, if blizz wants you to play on your own players, they will make you think that it's the best choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason the said players would get own language realms is because they're pretty much a plague to any non-speakers of those languages, on their home realms.<br />
<br />
I have no experience with the Italians, but my battlegroup got a heavy amount of polish players, who sadly, don't understand a brick of English. Realms such as Crushridge and Dunemaul is completely deserted for any English speaking players.<br />
<br />
It's a sad evolution, and I'm disappointed with the WoW communities in the said countries. <br />
<br />
And from a real life perspective, I'm disappointed with Poland. There's no hope for a serious rebuild of the countries economy if they refuse to learn other languages, and avoid any form of internalization.<br />
<br />
Italy don't surprise me though, they always been like that in culture. Reminds me of the French, thehehe ;-)<br />
<br />
<br />
Judging players by sterotypes is what you do.<br />
If you read a bit you would know that Polish economy resists the global crisis pretty well. So there's nothing to rebuild.<br />
Whats more you dont know anything about the economy. Blizzard is a company which values their profit most. The cost of localising the client and making few polish servers may be covered by the subscription income from players who are brought to the game and atracted by Polish servers. If their analisis tells them its profitable they are going to do it. Same was with Russian servers.<br />
<br />
On the other hand being a Polish player myself I am not interested in Polish servers. I have english speaking friends (from different countries) on my realm and I wouldnt abandon them just to play with people whom I dont know but who are from the same country as me.</div></div><hr />

Imo it's a improvement for most of the players atm 'cause (i'm speaking for Italians) many of us - and i think it's well known - are not so keen on english, so... if blizzy considers that's a good way to improve gameplay for us and for Polish guys, it's a welcome news :)<br />

I read the news on Polish distributor homepage and it says that those people are beeing looked for new Battle.net platform, which includes other Blizzard's brands, not only World of Warcraft.<br />
Honestly I don't think there will be Polish servers launched or Polish client created, simply becouse the majority of Polish players would stay on their current servers and use English client anyway. We are used to English names and we're enjoing it.<br />
Where it comes to communication problems I think it differs on every realm. I have been playing a lot of realms, where on each I found one big community of one language speakers who wouldn't like to interact in different language then theirs. Since Blizzard allows it, I don't mind, but in my opinion, one who decides playing WoW, knows that this game is avaible in given languages only and whining about not understanding something is rather, let's say, rude...<br />
Learning English (or any other Western language) for Polish ppl (or from any other middle or eastern european countries) is not only learning new words, but sometimes totally changing ways ot thinking. Since it's hard for older Polish people to learn it, we're doing best at learning children. But remember also, that this process started more or less 10 years ago, and those who will speak propper english at the level of scandinavian countries will be in the majority in around 20-40 years, not earlier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You not considering the fact that most of us Italians (and I guess Polish) who read this boards, do know English and are able to communicate.<br />
So, we do not feel any urge to move to an &quot;Italian&quot; server, simply because language is not a barrier for us, but there are many other players, who don't read this boards, and they do not understand them, and who may be interested in moving to one of those kind of servers.<br />
<br />
Oh, on a side note, I find funny those comments about people not willing to learn English, I wonder if those making em do know any foreign language or just think that everyone in the world must speak theirs for some reason.</div></div><hr />

i think it wont help much if they dont change subscription price. imo this is bigger problem than language barrier for most of polish players. especially if you take into account the fact that many ppl simply dont get the idea of paying for games ^^. and still this 13 EUR per month is quite much for polish standards.<br />

dont get me wrong, im not whining about price, just saying that translating wow to polish wont help much. our playerbase isnt that high as of other languages anyway. most likely they are just going to include polish language in their help desk</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you are right though.<br />
<br />
Some ppl doesnt want to understand that huge amount of players, either polish or italian or from any other country is at age of 12-16 (some of them even younger :) ), so well... dont expect them to be fluent in english as you are. Everyone got time to learn, and bcoz of the game, they ARE learning already, which is good. <br />
<br />
We will see how it goes with the realms, it would be nice to have some as i mentioned already, but i dont think it is all about WoW itself, most likely it could be something to do with battle.net and support of all other blizzard's games. I'm saying yes for polish and italian realms, but from the other POV i do think it may lose its all magic once translated, but we will see what blizzard really wants to do. I wish i could apply for that but nahh, i've just signed new contract for flat in london ffs ;/</div></div><hr />

Exactly, and most of us polish ppl started their journey with wow from private servers then moved to official realms. Most of us ( polish players ) know situation on those servers.

Since Blizzard wants battle.net to be one community and have all their games integrated under this system, personally I belive this recruitment will be most likely connected to battle.net itself. None of this jobs refer to GameMasters - read the jobs descriptions, it is customer service mostly, outside the game, and community moderations (forums for example). <br />
I know lot of Polish people with billing problems, as not all Polish bank cards are accepted by Blizzard. They write emails and sometimes call billing department, but not always their problems are solved. I am not defending Polish players' poor knowledge of English, but I suppose it would be easier for both sides to comunicate in native language. So, I really hope for Polish (and perhaps some other European languages) customer service and NOT for Polish realms ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
...... To take just one example, we think that last season if you were trying to decide between a hunter and warrior, the hunter brought a lot more to the table. There was no benefit to be gained from taking a warrior instead. There were a lot of reasons for this, but one of them was that physical damage just wasn't that useful and another was that warriors could never keep on a target.<br />
<br />
Last season was a total failure and a messup... It doesen't even count as a season... <br />
And in some previous blue post GC said that although hunters are now pretty bad in 2v2 bracket and under-represented (for obvious resons), well it's ok, because they are much better in 5v5s....... ahmm right...<br />
<br />
Well, unfortunately, it's not ok, if you want to play arenas every day, it's easy ehough to organize with your ONE partner in a 2v2, but try orginizing FIVE people together to play often enough... Add to that that it needs to be at least a decent setup...<br />
2v2 and 5v5 can NOT compare! Any class that is under-represented for such obvious resons in a 2v2 bracket is something the people in charge of those things need to take a look at. Saying they are good in a 5v5 which is for most WoW players a hard thing to organize daily, is a weak excuse...</div></div><hr />

Some ppl doesnt want to understand that huge amount of players, either polish or italian or from any other country is at age of 12-16 (some of them even younger :) ), so well... dont expect them to be fluent in english as you are. Everyone got time to learn, and bcoz of the game, they ARE learning already, which is good. <br />
<br />
We will see how it goes with the realms, it would be nice to have some as i mentioned already, but i dont think it is all about WoW itself, most likely it could be something to do with battle.net and support of all other blizzard's games. I'm saying yes for polish and italian realms, but from the other POV i do think it may lose its all magic once translated, but we will see what blizzard really wants to do. I wish i could apply for that but nahh, i've just signed new contract for flat in london ffs ;/<br />

<br />
From my experiences in trying to learn Japanese (still trying), most second languages are very rarely corrupted by slang when they're taught, so non-native speakers are generally more proper but less &quot;street smart&quot; with the language. <br />
<br />
I'm also not a fan of the &quot;Everyone should learn English&quot; motto. Honestly, it keeps the world refreshing having so many different languages and cultures. <br />
<br />
It can be troublesome in the US sometimes though, especially at work =( I was trying to figure out what this couple from India was wanting, their youngest child understood a bit of English but not enough for me to help them adequately. I also come across Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish, Tagalog, and Thai on a frequent basis (and this is just working at a department store). Then again, like I said, it kind of keeps things fresh. <br />
<br />
Though honestly, I'm quite jealous of all you countries that are bilingual. I think it'll change in the US soon though, Spanish is becoming a very popular language here. There has been quite a bit of mention of making English / Spanish the official US language sometime, though I doubt it'll ever happen. It shows the impact the language has in the US though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofcourse polish support team would be great and it would also feel very handly for many ppl to have the quests translated. Not all polish players know english which is mainly due to higher importance of german or russian languages in poland untill not so many years ago and anybody who knows the basics of european history will know why (unlike some ignoramus who said polish ppl &quot;refuse to learn english&quot; sigh). The situation is and will keep getting better as english has became the primary language in all schools now.<br />
<br />
But im also wondering if its a good idea to make a polish only realm. Personally I think playing on 1 nation only realms stops the feeling that you play a WORLD class game. Even though its great to be a majority on the realm, as polish players are now on Burning legion, which is a great realm in all ways including the culture and atmosphere (some may disagree but they have either never played there, never played anywhere else, are unable to judge objectively), it would just feel awkwardly bad to be the ONLY nation on the realm. Just tell me whats funnier than hearing foreign player saying &quot;KURWA MAC?&quot;</div></div><hr />

But what can we do? Stereotypes will still exist, same with people who blind belive in it.<br />
And about polish client, well... It can be funny with names, but if someone played in polish edition of World of WarCraft: The Boardgame, then (s)he can know that translation of WoW PC doesn't has to be a lol. Also I don't think they're going to give us polish client, I bet this all is only about support(at least!!!), but that a lot for us! About playing on polish client - well I'm pretty sure I'll try this out, but only with my alt! My main will 4ever stay on international server.<br />
And about age, someone said something about age range 12-16 years. Well, that's hurts because when I was 16, I've allready played WoW for 2 years, and there was really a lot of &quot;adult&quot; players (20+) whos was behaving far worst than me...<br />
Also about polish, who can't english - remember that Poland was a communist country not so long ago, and english wasn't that language, which we were educating in. Generation of polish, whos can english is just coming! ;P<br />

That's all! ;)<br />

<br />
<br />
WoW itself is built on segregating the player population. If there was no stupid Alliance vs Horde would we have a every player on the server to chose from for instances and raids. Instead, Blizzard seperated both groups and limits the amount of players you can chose from for an instance/raid.<br />
<br />
As for itemizing Plate, I know I'm sick of Stamina on DPS Plate. I'm also sick of the blue slots on all the new Ulduar DPS Plate they added. To get that +8 Hit socket bonus I need to slot in some kind of +Stamina gem? No thanks. It's like they want to punish you for wanting to use a decent Meta gem in your helmet.</div></div><hr />

So you are among the few that do have CCs, and even give your kids one, wow.

<br />
Visa Electron is not a credit card - it is a debit card. What I meant was that debit cards are most popular type of cards avaliable in Poland - and not all of them can be used to pay for WoW. Personally, when I started playing I couldn't use Electron type card from mBank (Polish internet bank), I had to use their &quot;virtual card&quot; made especially for internet purchases. Since I moved from Poland, I don't know if Electron is now recognized by billing system, but it wasn't that time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
QFT, the whole reason I'm learning Japanese is because I want to visit the country. It seems rude to visit another country and not try to learn the language. Sadly not a lot of people feel this way, I've met many immigrants in the States who have no intention of learning English and it's kind of irritating, especially when you work retail (me) and they expect you to help them. Help me help you! On the other hand, regardless of how bad some may speak it, I greatly appreciate the ones who at least try.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt that it's the same other places, I have a friend who wants to live in France but has no plans on learning French, which seems quite rude to me.</div></div><hr />

As an American who lives in Poland (btw, I am not another ignorant person, I &quot;bother&quot; to learn Polish like most Poles here &quot;bother&quot; to learn English, or German, or what language). I go to many shops, and most people know I am having trouble with Polish and speak English. Sure it may not be perfect, but I am nowhere near perfect in Polish and I can understand everything they're saying. Almost all kids learn English in school, and even grandmothers know some English. So maybe come to Poland and go to some shops or something before making assumptions?<br />
<br />
Lesson learned: Most Poles do know English pretty well. (Btw, Poland is pretty cool ;D)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, the other remarks that relate to this about the economy. The Polish economy is doing very well. According to the Wall Street Journal, it was the one of the only 3 countries in Europe to have its GDP increased in the first quarter of 2009(The other two were Greece and Cyprus)[Also, with the economy doing well, Poland's economy is doing way better than all of the North American countries too. <br />
<br />
So what were you saying about the economy sucking?<br />

As an American who lives in Poland (btw, I am not another ignorant person, I &quot;bother&quot; to learn Polish like most Poles here &quot;bother&quot; to learn English, or German, or what language). I go to many shops, and most people know I am having trouble with Polish and speak English. Sure it may not be perfect, but I am nowhere near perfect in Polish and I can understand everything they're saying. Almost all kids learn English in school, and even grandmothers know some English. So maybe come to Poland and go to some shops or something before making assumptions?<br />
<br />
Lesson learned: Most Poles do know English pretty well. (Btw, Poland is pretty cool ;D)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, the other remarks that relate to this about the economy. The Polish economy is doing very well. According to the Wall Street Journal, it was the one of the only 3 countries in Europe to have its GDP increased in the first quarter of 2009(The other two were Greece and Cyprus)[Also, with the economy doing well, Poland's economy is doing way better than all of the North American countries too. <br />
<br />
So what were you saying about the economy sucking?<br />
<br />
Do widzenia i sto lat. (Sorry bout the spelling)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You so much. Was about to write something similar, but since im from Poland, it wouldnt be as convincing :) <br />
<br />
Screw You, and Your outdated stereotypes, Nezoia :P</div></div><hr />

Every polish guy i know in wow can understand and write without problems in english language, so for the love of god stop acting like moron with such accusations.<br />
<br />
personaly i do not belive they will make polish client of wow (like my prespeechers have said i cant imagine the names of buffs dots items talents skills ect), but customer support in polish is something interesting i must say, if the number of poles playing wow was small they wouldnt make such kind move to polish community.</div></div><hr />

Word. For example, it has localized creature names (http://de.wowhead.com/?pet=6) based on how the French altered that name (http://fr.wowhead.com/?pet=6).<br />
Not to mention countless references which could have been saved easily by either translating them better, or just leaving them in English, since nearly everyone would have understood them.<br />
And to top that, the once-head of localization (a person who is hated by a great number of the German playerbase) idolized himself by imposing his name on a TB NPC (http://de.wowhead.com/?npc=8674).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aureliana</div><div class="date">2009-05-20, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't doubt that it's the same other places, I have a friend who wants to live in France but has no plans on learning French, which seems quite rude to me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Even if you study french for 4 years like me, when they discover you're not french they treat you like a maggot. (Maybe just because i'm italian, and they're still angry as hell for the 2006 football wc :D)<br />
<br />
However i've just transfered to magtheridon eu (alliance side :(((( ) with my guild and even if they translate wow in italian i don't think we will transfer to a new server, after 2 years in the laggy crushiridge eu (which, unintentionally, is ALREADY an italian server, with english gms).</div></div><hr />
