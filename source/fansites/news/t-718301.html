Grim Batol<br />
Grim Batol was founded by the Wildhammers. The Wildhammers abandoned their new home after the war with the Dark Irons left the place tainted. The Dragonmaw clan later moved in and attempted to harvest the eggs of Alextrasza for sinister purposes, though they failed to fully satisfy Deathwing. With the four Dragon Aspects confronting both Deathwing and the Dragonmaws, Grim Batol was abandoned. Members of the Red Dragonflight stayed behind to guard its corridors in the Twilight Highlands.<br />

Twin Peaks Battleground<br />
That I can't say, but there will be a Twilight Highlands Battleground called Twin Peaks. The Alliance will be working with the Wildhammers in a struggle for land against the Dragonmaws backed by the Horde.

MLG Announces World of Warcraft as 2010 Pro Circuit Title (From MLGPro.com (http://www.mlgpro.com/content/news/305696/MLG-Announces-World-of-Warcraft-as-2010-Pro-Circuit-Title-Starting-in-Columbus))<br />
On the heels of another successful season in 2009, Major League Gaming is pleased to announce World of Warcraft is returning to the MLG Pro Circuit. More excitement, more matches, more teams, and more prize money are just a few of the things that will make 2010 a year to remember.<br />
<br />
The season kicks off June 4-6 in Columbus, Ohio, where 16 of the top World of Warcraft 3v3 Arena teams from around the globe will be invited to square off. Teams will compete in two groups of eight teams each, in a round robin format, with the top two teams from each group advancing to a double-elimination Championship Bracket where winners will take home over $15,000 in cash.<br />
<br />
Starting with Raleigh, an Online Qualifier will be held prior to each Live Competition. The top four placing teams in this open competition will earn invitations to the following live event. The top two placing teams in the Online Qualifier will also receive hotel accommodations for the following live event. Also beginning in Raleigh, each Regular Season live event will host 16 teams total: the top four teams from previous event, four MLG invited teams, four Online Qualifier placing teams, and four open registration slots available for purchase.<br />
<br />
MLG Rank Points will be awarded at each of the three live Regular Season events based on where each team finishes. The season will culminate with the 2010 World of Warcraft Championship. Up to eight teams, determined by MLG Rank Points, will face off for $25,000 in cash and the title of MLG 2010 World of Warcraft Champion.<br />
<br />
The MLG Pro Circuit broadcast crew will also be kicking it up a notch this year with the return of the Live Broadcast from each Pro Circuit Live Competition. The all new MLG WoW Primetime Show, as well as many select matches from the Online Qualifiers, will be broadcast live throughout the season at GotFrag.com and MMO-Champion.com. Stay tuned to MLGPro.com and GotFrag.com for more information on the season and broadcast schedules.<br />
<br />
Players, this is your chance to bring your game to the ultimate battleground and join the ranks of professional gamers on the Major League Gaming Pro Circuit. If youâ€™re interested in competing at MLG Columbus, please e-mail rmoore@mlgpro.com. Fans, prepare yourself for more matches and excitement than you can imagine delivered live, directly to your living room. World of Warcraft's 2010 Season on the MLG Pro Circuit is almost here.

The MMO Report<br />
It's time for your weekly MMO Report, with a slight update because I screwed up the beginning of their show, oops. <br />
<br />
First off, we have to let you all know that the first story in this week's MMO Report has an update. Right after we shot this episode Blizzard asked MMO-Champion.com to take down all the images and information they had up about Cataclysm. We apologize, but still heartily recommend checking their site out.<br />

Oh, hey boub, I don't know if this was or wasn't in your datamining on the pre-cata event a few months back, but currently there's a member of the earthen ring outside orgrimmar on the PTR who talks about his zepplin having been attacked by the twilight's hammer<br />

It might raise the question what &quot;fan art&quot; really is or should be - personally i kinda enjoy that Blizzards Fan art forum have become this uncencored gallery for mad skills. As long as they keep it uncencored offcourse - and dosnt add a &quot;skill cap&quot;. Shouldnt there be room for the 12 year old kid who spends the afternoon with a cardbox, drawing his favorit Blizzard hero as well?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the Dragonmaw Clan was part of the Horde in the second war and I guess Garrosh's style of leading suits them a lot better than Thrall's so they'll rejoin.<br />

Just for that he deserves all the hate he's getting and then some.<br />

The fanart is .... woah... amazing! Oo Could have been done by Blizzard themselves, definitely among the best I've ever seen there. The black/white red one is especially awesome :D Horde never looked that awesome. Reminds me a lot of anime, there's sometimes pictures of the group of main characters in poses such as this, usually in different clothes than the ones they wear in the anime, usually modern ones, think surfer dude vs samurai, business suit vs ninja etc.</div></div><hr />

I wonder why there is a blood elf behind that dwarf? Is he going to kill the dwarf? Why the dwarf let a gay blood elf go behind him? How can a night elf and a demonic blood elf go together so quiet?

<br />
Well, his bright green eyes, his face with pent-up anger, his earrings, his haughty attitude, his ornate weapon with golden colors, etc ... It is quite clear that it is a Blood Elf not a High Elf.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Uhmm this example is not valid. Sergeant Bly is just a traitor. Maybe Valeera Sanguinar (http://www.wowwiki.com/Valeera) is a better example. Anyway it is not normal, in fact I think Valeera is the only blood elf who has betrayed the Horde and is of the Alliance now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention that elf may as well be a Scryer<br />
<br />
<br />
The Scryers do not engage in such conflicts, so they will not take sides by the Horde nor by the Alliance. Maybe with the Horde, because their brothers are in the Horde.</div></div><hr />

Last year a few a friends and I attended MLG in Columbus, OH (to see the WoW arena tournament and thats pretty much it) and found that it was an absolutely terrible experience. There was nowhere to watch the tournament. Absolutely nowhere. There were barriers around all the HP Blackbirds so we werent able to see anything on their monitors, and the ONLY screen that contained any information about what might be going on was a single monitor for the announcers. On the first day this caused all the WoW fans to crowd as close to the walled off announcer section as possible in an attempt to see anything. The second day they expanded the barrier around the announcer section so that we were no longer able to see anything. Keep in mind, all the other games had some sort of &quot;audience&quot; tv. There were Gears of War stations set up all around the floor with 8 consoles, each with a large flat screen tv mounted high above the player so others could watch. Then of course there was the 3 large screens at the VIP area. No one cared about WoW though.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if they are planning to do anything about this? It's really quite depressing when you PAY to see something live and in person and end up finding out that it's simply better to watch the stream at home.</div></div><hr />

Twin Peaks BG: Like others have said, it's kinda weird for the Horde to suddenly be friends (or at least allies) with the Dragonmaw. But perhaps they've turned into something better.<br />
(Isn't there some clan-leader in Garadar in Nagrand that leads an orc clan that's supposed to be evil as well? Some eye-name guy?)<br />

Fan-art: This man or woman named Tooth deserved the Most Awesome Person on the Internet Award of the Week. If it doesn't exist, we need to make it exist. Seriously, that fan-art is just... WOW.

<br />
That first picture goes straight to my desktop background, and that's saying something, with me usually disliking the gansta/dark tone of things. It's just too B-A to not get.<br />

There's more examples of cross-faction interactions though. For example in the 'Sunwell Trilogy' (if it's concidered canon) Harkyn Grymstone http://www.wowwiki.com/Harkyn_Grymstone who is a dragon hunter is accompanied by his gang of 2 orcs and 1 troll. So it might not be normal that this kind of interaction occures but there is some simple explanations to why they might happen. The trio in the fan art could be part of a faction (think twiligt hammer or the Venture Co) or just share similar interests.</div></div><hr />

Just for that he deserves all the hate he's getting and then some.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously Garrosh, The Dragonmaw Clan, Thrall didn't want to ally with the Dragonmaw, given what they did in the Second war, These guys were the Enslavers of Alexstrasza, in case you forgot, and she never forgets, or forgives very easily. You side with them, and expect the Red Dragonflight to become another of your enemies, Blizzard better have a very good story for this.<br />
<br />
Garrosh is easily becoming the most hated leader within the horde come Cataclysm, let's see, Cairne to be kill as a 'traitor to the horde', Forsaken, Goblins, Blood Elves and Trolls will be kicked out of Orgrimmar, now he sides with the Dragonmaw Orcs. The Alliance already hates Garrosh, Varian locked swords with him before in the 3.1 trailer. If Saurfang the Elder can get finish his mourning for his son, please let him come and keep his promise of killing Saurfang, for what he is trying to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, remember the Horde is largely composed of orcs, who used to drink demon blood, serve the Burning Legion, etc. They don't anymore. One of the big elements of Blizzard's whole storytelling narrative is that people, and a people, can and do change over time.<br />
<br />
The Dragonmaws have a dark past, but that goes for the entire orcish race. The last thing anyone in the Horde should do is cast stones about what anyone's done in their past.<br />
<br />
If the Dragonmaws, in the absence of their old and evil leadership, are willing to cast aside their old ways and seek redemption and admittance into the new Horde, well, the Horde is all about second chances, fresh starts, etc. There ain't a single race in the Horde that has the right to cast a stone, saying, &quot;Let none who have done evil in the past join with us now.&quot;<br />
<br />
For that matter, neither do the Alliance races. The difference between the Horde and the Alliance is the Alliance will cast the stones anyway and pretend their past is lily white. The greatest evils always hide under the banner of righteousness.</div></div><hr />

And for the ppl that are trying to figure out &quot;where did I saw that?&quot;, well here's a news flash for u, those kind of pics are everywhere. Mostly in manga color pages. They're just that awesome. U shouldn't drag its value down, because u've seen something like it somewhere. It's a superb piece of art, with attitude. <br />

I enjoy this style and I agree it's nice a drawing. A lot of artists, manga ones included, draw something similar to this.</div></div><hr />

Bands were doing it far earlier than mange* I'd imagine. It's a really popular pose/style for CD and even old record covers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*manga. Firefox doesn't recognize &quot;manga&quot; so I used its first suggestion.</div></div><hr />

Don't know about your problems with the word &quot;manga&quot;, it is a correct one however. Maybe language thing. Mange, says my google, is a skin disease. <br />
<br />
About cd covers, rightly so, I would assume that even cavemen made those poses for artist to hack it in stone.</div></div><hr />

Heh. That was the joke. It's weird that Firefox's spell checking thingie wouldn't recognize &quot;manga&quot;, so to make light of the situation I used its suggestion.</div></div><hr />

I just love that Gangster Horde fan art.. and I love those adjustments you posted earlier. So I had to add our beloved goblin into it... I know it's not the perfect match but I did my best... don't have much photoshop experience yet :D<br />
<br />
I can upload PSD aswell so maybe someone with better experience can improve it even more :)<br />
