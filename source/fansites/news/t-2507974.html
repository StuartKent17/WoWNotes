Without giving credit to the source of these ddosers... You can see specifically they're targeting WoW. Be it through a provider or the source, the end result is the same, They ARE going after servers. I've seen their tweets.</div></div><hr />

thing is its easy for people to claim this... just for the attention, you say &quot;they targeted servers!&quot; but both retail and classic went down, ALL SERVERS so that claim is BS'<br />
especially since they said &quot;Ok stay away from pvp servers then for the nexzt few hours as we are tasrgeting those&quot; but again ALL servers went down.</div></div><hr />

You can be intelligent enough to understand how something works but fundamentally be so stupid that it lacks common sense. President Trump says hello for an example.<br />
IQ doesn't measure actual intelligence nor would it be relevant to a person ideology.</div></div><hr />

You underestimate bored people with the right tools or simple curiosity. A lot of hackers do what they do simply to see how far they can get before getting caught. Not really a tangible reward.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt a scriptkiddie can rent enough bandwidth to bring down an entire 20gbit lane + 10gbit lane together. I may be in the wrong here, but I doubt this guy is as stupid as he claims out to be.<br />
<br />
I think it would be more interesting to see data where this attack came from in terms of ip-addresses, so you could see if it was home computers (infected botnet) or large data farms somewhere.</div></div><hr />

They are not comparable in the slightest if it was just wikipedia I would suspect a political reason given they have very clear bias in how information is presented and what information is presented. That it includes blizz makes that seem less likely though.</div></div><hr />

Usualy a with disabling services with a ddos isn't the primary Motive of the ddos. Usualy the ddos has the purpose of over loading the security systems to try and sneak a hack in to steal data like account data.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard cannot fix much of anything except to co-operate with their internet providers since the DDOS attacks are targeted to nodes upstream of their network infrastructure. It's much easier to attack nodes with less security that are upstream of Blizzard. These are mostly provider nodes. This is also why you can sometimes see side effects on other areas of the internet that also rely on those nodes.</div></div><hr />

If you know how DDOS works, you would understand why it's almost impossible to prevent.<br />
<br />
I think the prevention for this comes in the form of blizzard's response. If you DDOS Blizz, you serve jail time.<br />

Don't go to forums raging about it. Don't tweet out about it. Just silently do something else. Trust me the targets they will go after are those that provide the most rage because that generates a story and buzz which in turn attraches media outlets that further show the world what they can do. Free advertisement more or less combined with a bigger ego stroke. <br />

I doubt it, since the DDOS would affect them as well since it is against the Battle.net Servers not specifically Classic.<br />

If anything likely just randoms that have nothing to do with WoW doing it to troll People that they know are enjoying something. Like literally every other time Blizzard has been DDOS'd</div></div><hr />
