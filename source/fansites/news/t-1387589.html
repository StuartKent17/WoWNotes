The game seems quite good and its differences to say dota 2 or LoL are actually really appealing from what I've seen. I'd say Blizzard did a good job for a first moba game.<br />
<br />
As for soloq. People go there to win, whether they have X or Y kills is irrelevant to the game since it's not how you win it, not necessarily.<br />
<br />
And no one asked if this will be a free to play,like Hearthstone ?<br />

LoL's Howling Abyss generally lasts around that time either and it's quite popular.<br />

it doesn't really need to, it's not a dota clone, it won't compete with dota directly. It looks pretty unique if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I feel kinda weird about it. I've been very excited to hear more about Heart of the Storm but the whole thing about not relying even a bit on your personal skill leaves me kinda eh about the whole thing... I dunno, I'll def try it but I'm just having some nagging thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the mounts are only up for the start of the game? like first 1 minute or so to allow you to get to your spot faster. I don't think you can simply just mount up whenever you want.<br />
<br />
And there is no time limit. What they meant is that this game usually lasts on average 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hour long matches are fun. 20 minutes matches seems like to me - a total pubstomp.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dioxy</div><div class="date">2013-11-09, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope they decide to reverse a few changes to the game.<br />
<br />
20 minute matches are not enough. If a match is 20 minutes long, I consider that a pub-stomp in most case scenarios with dota 2 or LoL. <br />
<br />
I don't like the &quot;team effort &gt; individual play&quot;. The idea is good, but in all reality your not playing with friends, and you really don't care about your teammates. <br />
<br />
I hope they implement in-game items. But this game to me sounds more like a PvP game rather then a MOBA, and I hope that's not the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on whether it's a ton of action such as the 71 minute Dignitas vs. CLG game in LoL, or a farm/turtling fest such as the 98 minute DK vs. iG game in DOTA 2.<br />
<br />
<br />

I don't like the &quot;team effort &gt; individual play&quot;. The idea is good, but in all reality your not playing with friends, and you really don't care about your teammates. <br />

That's probably to limit the snowbally nature that is inherent to MOBAs, granted they only get to the point of 1v5ing in certain situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
don't be so sure. Since the game will be focusing more on team plays, it can be a serious threat to current trend of MOBA and maybe a fix to the toxic in-game community. A few feeds won't affect much to overall team's performance, open more to strategy game play rather than last hitting creeps, mindless farming for the first 20mins of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they are fun. Being behind for the entire game and finally winning a team fight then pushing for the win is awesome<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't understand the removal of last hitting. Being ahead in cs grants lane control and the obvious advantage of better items. Is there even items? This all sounds a bit meh tbh. I don't like the emphasis on team coordination either. Sure it's great with 4 friends on Skype but in a random groups it's horrible.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm not sure now. :o<br />
<br />
Let me clarify, this game will not have a competitive scene, nor will it seriously compete with LoL or Dota in the moba market.<br />
Blizzard didn't say they want the game to be a competitive one. They clearly said that is up to the community.<br />
<br />
I too doubt a game with a 20 minutes limit mark can have competitive play but it is possible if the community of this game wants it, along with the devs of the game of course.<br />
<br />
MOBAs create some of the worst gaming communities. Be prepared to be yelled at a lot if you aren't at least some what decent at MOBA games.<br />
Mobas?<br />
<br />
You mean online games. No online game is an exception to this. Also, a few bad apples shouldn't be able to make you quit a game if you actually like the game.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the removal of last hitting. Being ahead in cs grants lane control and the obvious advantage of better items. Is there even items? This all sounds a bit meh tbh. I don't like the emphasis on team coordination either. Sure it's great with 4 friends on Skype but in a random groups it's horrible.<br />
There are no items in the game, that's why last hitting doesn't matter. All you need is XP and that is global.</div></div><hr />

Hop into any public MOBA match today and see why basing a MOBA around team play is a bad idea. Furthermore, people like the concept of individual progression and getting super sick items and stomping the other team. It's a deeply rewarding part of the game when you go 22-0 and are decked out in the best items. <br />
<br />
The art design is amazing though and I like the concept of more side objectives, but the overall gameplay still raises a lot of questions.</div></div><hr />

And? You think being forced to work with 4 random people is the epitome of &quot;fun&quot;? Have you played any MOBA? The idea in theory sounds fun, but in all reality it WILL play out badly.</div></div><hr />

LoL and dota 2 don't revolve around teamwork as much as this game probably will, hence not that essential to win a game, at least in LoL since one person alone in there can win a game. This will not be possible in Heroes of the Storm.<br />
<br />
So the comparison of the teamwork required of this game to say dota 2 or LoL is not a good one because those two don't promote that much of teamwork since one person can carry the game alone without the help of others.</div></div><hr />

Further you haven't played it. You haven't seen matches of it yet. There's so much time in which things could change. Hearthstone from the presentation looks dumb, but it's SUPER fun. It's all about the gameplay, which is no where near it's final iteration.<br />
<br />
It's premature and completely absurd to make any conclusions on whether the game will be good or not. If it's not a lot of fun, I doubt Blizzard will release it.</div></div><hr />

Further you haven't played it. You haven't seen matches of it yet. There's so much time in which things could change. Hearthstone from the presentation looks dumb, but it's SUPER fun. It's all about the gameplay, which is no where near it's final iteration.<br />

The game looks practically finished and there has been already a few matches shown in BlizzCon.</div></div><hr />

The laning phase could easily be halved time-wise and it wouldn't detract from the experience at all imo.<br />
<br />
10 mins laning/buildup, 10 mins pushing/teamfights. Sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
I hope this game shakes the genre up.</div></div><hr />

First CCG with Hearthstone and now MOBA with HoTS, canot wait to play Malfurion XD</div></div><hr />
