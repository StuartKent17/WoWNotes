Don't worry, he's apparently too dense to realize that these people have huge ilvls, and that because someone with a high ilvl out dps'd him in his +3, suddenly tanks are just OP damagers</div></div><hr />

The pally in the run here, U'll find good tanks can do 80-120% of dmg from dps on aoe packs. This being a tyranical week really stuffs the numbers overall since tanks on single target is pretty eh. Obviously depends on length of pull / how many mobs and difficulty. As you go higher and cant just facetank huge groups forever you start to fall behind.</div></div><hr />

Their overall dps for the group was like 52.5k. This is actually really good overall DPS because they don't have to run a healer. They make up for the low ST dps by doing bigger trash pulls and doing crazy aoe tank dps. Outside of the really high end groups, you really wont see groups doing 52.5k dps overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happened in the past do change what is right and what is wrong. Just because tanks were broken in Legion doesn’t mean they should be broken now.<br />
<br />
10k is too much. I have also seen tanks do 15k on single target. Tanks’ role is not to do dps. They should do 2k or something like that on a single target fight.<br />
<br />
I can also ask: Why do tanks need to do dps? Why can’t that task be left to the damage dealers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because tanks need to be able to kill stuff in a reasonable time while playing solo as well.<br />
<br />
I already hate questing as prot because it takes forever to kill stuff compared to ret. I can pull a ton of mobs and aoe them to death much faster as ret. <br />
<br />
If tank dps was lower, nobody would play a tank because they would be practically unplayable outside of a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets say tank does 10k dps then we got 42.5k between 3 dps which doesnt seem too hard to accomplish to me and that is if the healer is literally doin no dps, esspecially in a teeming week.</div></div><hr />

Dps and threat generation shouldn’t be linked for tanks. You could easily make tanks abilities generate a lot of threat without doing a lot of damage.<br />

<br />
I know people who rather level/do wq in heal spec than go dps. Im certain theres people that feel the same about their tank spec, not to mention tanks already do garbage single target and okay aoe at best. Nerfing it even more would just make people upset, i mean theres a reason most tanks loved mop because their dmg was actually relevant.</div></div><hr />

So again who do you think wants to play a class or spec that does near 0 dmg and just a taunt button? Where would the enjoyment be? As for the argument it is irrelevant outside of dungeons that’s just a crazy statement. A tank is more than what you apparently like to think of as a glorified target dummy.</div></div><hr />

i mean Cata hunter soloed Atramedes in BwD while the content was current<br />

or warlock soloing MoP Immerseus while current.<br />
<br />
or blood dks soloing kazzak in WoD while current.<br />

there are much more but i cba listing them all, these things happen in every expansion, so dont pin it on BfA.</div></div><hr />

This was rude but made me laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Totally true. Maybe the tanks' dmg could be adjusted, but yeah tanks need to be able to do the other content by themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dps and threat generation shouldn’t be linked for tanks. You could easily make tanks abilities generate a lot of threat without doing a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
That's a fine suggestion, but a discrete dmg output should be guaranteed to complete the other content.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of the game is irrelevant <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but this is just a pointless reply. You just put your opinion like gospel and pretend that everybody play the game the way YOU intend.</div></div><hr />

You want to nerf tanks damage by a truck load but increase threat to compensate? Yeah because taking a full minute to kill one mob in the world for WQ's is going to be so much fun. To compensate, I want ALL DPS to lose all their self sustain, and all their defensive cooldowns, those belong to tanks, meanwhile all healing specs will lose all means of dealing damage, they're healers after all, not damage dealers.<br />

<br />
Positioning and mechanics are still a thing, agro to some extend too (atleast in skittish week), but now you also focus on damage if you want to maximize. I dont see how thats a bad thing.<br />
<br />
At high end gameplay you have to focus on every bit of your spec, healers doin damage, tanks doin damage etc etc. Of course you can still play as a target dummy, but that doesnt mean everyone should be like that. Only time a tank truely outdpses you is if they overgear you or youre just reaaaaaaaaaally bad. i mean come on, we literally talk about 10k average dps, if you do that in a dps spec with 385 ilvl people will laught at you.</div></div><hr />

As a tank I care about all those things, avoiding all avoidable mechanics, corner pulling and kiting packs and on top of that my damage output. If tanks became a glorified target dummy doing 2k single target damage as was suggested, they would all but die out.<br />
It’s the same deal as a disc priest pumping numbers, or resto Druid with feral affinity. All these things add to making a higher key in time. The game would be stale indeed if healers could do nothing but heal and tanks nothing but taunt.</div></div><hr />

10k is too much. I have also seen tanks do 15k on single target. Tanks’ role is not to do dps. They should do 2k or something like that on a single target fight.<br />

Yea, let me know how holding threat goes with any less damage than that.<br />
<br />
and it is left to the damage dealers, thats why they do double the damage single target, and can burst multitudes higher.... <br />

You mean doing less dps than tanks back when tanks did shitty damage? Oh hell yes it was possible. Not sure how but I've seen quite a lot of that. Not counting LK heroics I tanked in dps gear, always doing like 40-50% of total group damage :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eapoe</div><div class="date">2019-01-07, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanks used to be just that, an armored force that survived things. Their damage was terrible. They focused on living thru a fight and holding aggro. Players complained because they also wanted to matter damage wise.<br />
Blizz started introducing mechanics such as Vengenance, a stacking damage buff based on how much damage (possibly mitigation also) they took. There were even fights where this mechanic let them cheese fights as they’d do damn near double damage of the entire raid itself.<br />
Now we’re at a point where Blizz just gives them more survivability than dps/heals and can do damage. Some even outdamage certain specs on trash pulls.<br />
I don’t think they are overtuned dps wise, but they are definitely strong in certain situations.</div></div><hr />

They can easily make a lot of tank abilities which do a lot of threat but very little damage. Problem solved.<br />

and it is left to the damage dealers, thats why they do double the damage single target, and can burst multitudes higher.... <br />

<br />
To be fair, that happened late in the xpack when +15 was the baseline to get your top weekly item, and easier than a +10 now. <br />
<br />
Still, it's true that such achievements have always happened, and why not? We're talking about five dedicated players with very high gear and good coordination running one of the easier dungeons during one of, if not the easiest combination of affixes. Of course they can go far, and I like it myself. The notion that tank damage needs to be reduced because of this is as nonsensical as claiming Vengeance needed to be nerfed after Mione beat Normal Gul'dan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i mean Cata hunter soloed Atramedes in BwD while the content was current<br />
<br />
or warlock soloing MoP Immerseus while current.<br />
<br />
or blood dks soloing kazzak in WoD while current.<br />
<br />
there are much more but i cba listing them all, these things happen in every expansion, so dont pin it on BfA.<br />
Soloing a single boss =/= de facto breaking a whole form of content<br />
<br />
Those one boss solos were mostly due to one bug or glitch or one overpowered spec or something.<br />
<br />
Now 5 tanks (notice, 5 different tanks) clearing +15 mythic+ in time is a monumentally different issue in scale. You realize how much shit they need to change/break to make this not a reality anymore? They need to change pretty much everything in the game. From tank damage and healing to encounter design, pvp, outdoor content etc.<br />

<br />
No need for the insults. You’re only embarrassing yourself by arguing based on emotions.<br />
<br />
First of all, all classes have dps specs to do solo content in. No one has said you’re meant to do WQ’s etc in tank spec. You’re not entitled to anything.<br />
<br />
But they could always make an offensive stance for solo content and a defensive stance for group content. That would fix it. The offensive stance would of course not be equal to a pure damage dealer but still have enough dps to handle solo content.<br />
<br />
In any case, just prepare yourself for the soon to come dps nerf.</div></div><hr />

I've seen people somehow do less than their listed weapon DPS. The one listed on their weapon, that is. In what is essentially a patchwork fight.<br />

I think you will find that there is nothing to nerf here. We are quite geared, all very experienced and communicated a lot better than what is required in most pugs. There is no &quot;cheese&quot; or class stacking. Most of us went quite defensive, and just over-pulled trash to make up for our lack of dmg on bosses. Biggest thing carrying us is resto affinity and hop from myself, and thats not something that is big enough to warrant a nerf. :D</div></div><hr />

To be fair, he spent such a huge time rooting / hibernating, running to get other mobs and getting out of bear over and over for all the little things. We weren't trying to min-max comp or i'd probably bring a few more pallies, just 5 guildies that thought it'd be fun. this was actually our 4th key together (11kr &gt; 12fh &gt; 14ur &gt; 15ur).

I already hate questing as prot because it takes forever to kill stuff compared to ret. I can pull a ton of mobs and aoe them to death much faster as ret. <br />

If i needed to play ret everytime i had to do anything other than dungeon / raid, i just wouldnt play a tank spec? Next you'll say healers shouldnt do dmg, so does that mean that you will just see 100% ret players in world content and then suddenly they will want to heal / tank for dungeons and raids? Completely illogical.</div></div><hr />

If this were true, nobody would play healers, because they don't do dick for damage. Killing things while questing as a healer is awful. But guess what, people just don't do that lol. Healers are a class designed to heal things not DPS, so of course they don't do good DPS (shocking). Tanks are supposed to hold aggro and keep the group alive indirectly by tanking most of the damage. They don't need to do 90% the DPS of damage dealers who literally only do damage as their roll. No tank is just stuck playing tank while questing. Respeccing takes literally 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />

If you can't outdamage a tank on a boss fight you are bad at this game plain and simple, if they do more damage than you in AoE you either: didn't get enough time to ramp up, or you're bad at this game.<br />
