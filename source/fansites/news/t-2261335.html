Blue Tweets<br />
So I crafted a lego prior to 7.2.5 and it has iLVL 970. I wish to sell it on AH, how do I make it 1000 iLVL?<br />
The impression that Legendaries could go to item level 1000 was a bug in the Dungeon Journal. At this time, item level 970 is the maximum. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/888130876642545665))<br />
<br />
Why has there been no official word regarding the Priest class mount trail effect nerf? Can we compromise? Miss the feathers!<br />
We removed only a few feathers* that were reaching the player camera. *per the artist, these aren't &quot;feathers&quot;, but &quot;magical owl dander&quot;. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/887795204492845058))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Purely design wise, what was your favorite WoW class to work on?<br />
Death knight, no question. It was just a blank slate, so we felt free to challenge every idea, rather than having a few years of built up expectations and history to contend with. I don’t mean to sound like those factors should be dismissed - far from it. It was just nice to start from very little. A death knight needs a sword, and there’s something about it being cold, and whatever abilities the character had in War3. That was about it.<br />
<br />
If that feels like a cop-out answer, then my next one is probably warrior. I always enjoyed how the WoW warrior felt like a mix between a soldier and a gladiator (and a bit of barbarian). It was fun to work with the rage mechanic, even when it could be really frustrating to tune sufficiently.

Nor do I. Unsuprisingly, they read like one long RP post, probably because she's a/was RPer herself.<br />

To be fair, DJ didn't make the script on his own, since you can see the difference between Horde and Alliance story.<br />
If he can make Tides of Darkness solo (which should be easy, since we already have orcs background set up now and adapting material from book is right there) then sequel should be better.</div></div><hr />

This says alot about the competence of the blizzard dev/testing team .<br />
They just release anything these days .People tell them about the problems on the PTR but they just choose to ignore everything .<br />

you are utterly clueless:<br />
<br />
some historical perspective, Paragon got world first heroic ragnaros 25 with half of their main team wearing full T11 heroic gear including the BiS sinestra drops, not a single piece of firelands gear on them, pray tell me oh mr high and mighty, were they also 'entitled' when they downed it at the time in the gear they had and expecting a clear to come?<br />
let me answer that for you, no they were not, and neither are method, the boss is purely a mechanics fight, execute it properly and in an appropriate level of gear you will down it, and that's what they did after blizz realise how badly they fucked up the tuning and actually started fixing it based on feedback given during PTR testing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you have a clue how good Method and Exorsus people are and how much it must be difficult for people at Blizzard to give them a challenge, as nobody is skilled enough to know how they will try to defeat the encounter.<br />
<br />
So yeah, they cannot test it completely internally or it would be too easy for Method/Exorsus<br />
<br />
It's always been like that, the world first guilds are really doing the QA of mythic mode.<br />
<br />
They hired mythic raiders to do testing for them, but unless they recruit Method themselves, it's kind of impossible to tune it properly for them and not have the Xavius mistake of a too easy encounter.</div></div><hr />

I doubt any of them would be interested in tying themselves to a franchise like Warcraft, and being constrained by whoever is writing lore now inside of Blizzard. They want to write their own worlds, where they're in control - they also have to be interested in the genre. The money is an issue, too - they don't get all of it, they get a cut - why would they give away a percentage of their earnings, when they can keep most of it themselves? Writing a book isn't easy, after all. That's why they get fan fic writers like Christy Golden - she's a professional fan fiction writer. <br />
<br />
I've always thought the same - they should hire a big name author to come in for a year, and write out the rest of the Warcraft lore, flesh it out, create new characters, breath some life back into the game...until I thought about it. It would be like hiring a world class artist to fill in the backgrounds in a painting someone else did - not exactly anyone's cup of tea, if they're an established artist.<br />

If she writes like she tweets its going to be awful<br />
<br />
It's her, of course it's going to be awful. I've yet to get more than a chapter into any of the books she wrote, she's a hack, pure and simple.</div></div><hr />

But they dont want to write for companies. Simply because they dont need to. Blizz has the money, it is not a problem.</div></div><hr />

Her writing thus far has been pretty dismal. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt and assuming that her hands were tied creatively... now we see what she can really do. Hopeful... but not expectant.<br />

My thoughts exactly. All the cheering when she her employment with Blizz was announced had my dying laughing. Her works tend to be on fanfiction levels and her grasp of the English language tends to feel spurious at best.<br />
<br />
I've seen better fan faction honestly.<br />
<br />
My brother-in-law applied for the position she now has. His first (incomplete novel) is infinitely better than anything she ever wrote.<br />
<br />
But perhaps now that she is part of the inner circle... she can actually progress the story, and develop characters... maybe? hopefully?</div></div><hr />

OMG yes to Rothfuss and Moon, *IF* you could clone them so they actually keep writing what they're already writing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except, if you asked Rothfuss we'd be waiting 10 years between each book or lore expansion. I love Rothfuss, but lets be realistic, he can't finish the series he's currently on at a reasonable pace or keep work coming at a reasonable pace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the vast, vast majority of us will.<br />
<br />
Not that you're making a valid point in the first place. They repeatedly state that it was the encounter design fucking them over, not any gear checks. There were at least two remarks made about having 950 equipped wouldn't have even helped them. They're in fact making your point exactly where you're failing to.</div></div><hr />
