He could ask for 8.3 and 9.0 too, so we would have few more minutes for serious questions in later Q&amp;As.</div></div><hr />

How do you know what ‘most of us’ want? Are you representing the majority, or are you just making assumptions based on your own opinions? Would like to see some reliable source on ‘most of us wants this’. <br />

Protip: a forum post with some replies does not count as ‘most of us’.</div></div><hr />

It was Alpha before and now it is Beta. I dunno if that means anything. It could be that it is now open but I don't know.</div></div><hr />

There have been many, many threads both here and on the official forums. It's been a wanted feature for a very long time, actually makes sense and has basis on the lore. Also fits the whole &quot;gather allies&quot; mentality. Alleria could easily tell Vereesa to bring her Covenant to the Alliance. There's no reason for Blizzard to object on that, since they've already broken the faction barriers and have already added small populations as an allied race. Also, I don't see a reason people get so aggressive towards those who want this feature or any other feature since it doesn't harm their gameplay or aesthetics. If you want, you play it. If you don't want to, that's fine.<br />
<br />
Also it would bring many more paid race changes than Lightforged or Dwarves or Kul'tirans for that matter, so it's strategically wise too.</div></div><hr />
