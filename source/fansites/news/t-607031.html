2.4.2 Patch Notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6683.0)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This post will be updated every few minutes / hours depending on how successful we are at spotting changes. <br />
<br />
Thursday April 24th<br />
A new PvP Trinket as been added to Honor Rewards Medallion of the Alliance (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/epicpvptrinket.jpg). There is obviously a horde version of the item and both of them cost 40 000 Honor Points. <br />
Epic gems are still sold by Shaani for 15 Badges (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/gem15badge.jpg) on PTRs ! This could mean that the official armory showing 10 badges was an error.<br />
The Quest &quot;The Multiphase Survey (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/multispectral.jpg)&quot;, where you retrieve surveys from Nagrand, no longer gives a [item=35232].<br />
Added screenshots for most of the item changes, also added the new stats for Naturalist's Preserving Cinch (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/naturalistcinch.jpg) and Borderland Fortress Grips (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/borderlandgrips.jpg)<br />
Added a screenshot for the new Theramore/Stonard portal spells (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/newportals.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wednesday April 23rd<br />
22:35 CEST - Actually, it looks like new items related to mount &quot;enchantments&quot; are indeed here (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/carrotonastickv2.jpg) ... Maybe they just didn't replace the old ones.<br />
21:35 CEST - Added the stats of the Purified Shadowsong Amethyst (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/purifiedshadowsong2.jpg) (Reward from the Shattered Sun Offensive, Exalted reputation required)<br />
21:30 CEST - PTRs are now live and old trinkets (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/mountspeed.jpg) haven't been replaced with mount enchantments ![/b][/u] at this time we can assume they will be added later in the game and maybe we won't even see them before WotLK.<br />
16:50 CEST - Fixed the last errors with item links. <br />
16:45 CEST - Added professions changes, added a few details about the [item=11122] in 2.4.2<br />
16:30 CEST - Fixed a small error in the item changes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Class changes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter<br />
It looks like Aspect of the Viper is slightly boosted<br />
Aspect of the Viper (2.4.0) - The hunter takes on the aspects of a viper, regenerating mana equal to up to 55% of his or her Intellect every 5 sec. The lower the hunter's current mana, the more mana will be regenerated. Only one Aspect can be active at a time.<br />
Aspect of the Viper (2.4.2) - The hunter takes on the aspects of a viper, regenerating mana equal to up to 55% of his or her Intellect plus 35% of his or her level every 5 sec. The lower the hunter's current mana, the more mana will be regenerated. Only one Aspect can be active at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changes<br />
Naturalist's Preserving Cinch (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/naturalistcinch.jpg) and Borderland Fortress Grips (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/borderlandgrips.jpg) have been upgraded.<br />
[item=19169] now has a chance to fail for targets above level 60<br />
[item=19955] now grants 70 (instead of 400) spell haste rating, and reduces the mana cost of Rejuvenation, Healing Touch, Regrowth, and Tranquility by -5% for 15 seconds. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br />
[item=19958] now grants 70 (instead of 400) spell haste rating and reduces the mana cost of your healing spells by -5% for 15 seconds. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br />
[item=19954] energy bonus is now reduced by 4 points by level after level 60, lowering the energy bonus to 20 at level 70 instead of 40. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br />
[item=32481] now reduces the mana cost of Flight Form and Swift Flight Form by -115. (See the &quot;Mount enchants&quot; section)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions changes<br />
A few changes here ...<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
A new recipe has been added - Purified Shadowsong Amethyst (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/purifiedshadowsong2.jpg) (Reward from the Shattered Sun Offensive, Exalted reputation required)<br />
<br />
Leatherworking<br />
[item=34207] now requires 4x[item=23793] and 3x[item=22452] (instead of 18 Leathers and 14 Primal)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Mounts<br />
According to spells and models available in the game files, at least two new mounts have been added to the game.<br />
<br />
Swift Zebra<br />
49322 : Swift Zebra - Summons and dismisses a rideable Swift Zebra. This is a very fast mount.<br />
<br />
Headless Horseman's Mount<br />
48023 : Headless Horseman's Mount - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.<br />
48024 : Headless Horseman's Mount, Ground - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.<br />
48025 : Use Headless Horseman's Reins<br />
<br />
The headless horseman mount &quot;,Ground&quot; effect could be the sign of a flying mount, but obviously nothing is confirmed yet. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Mounts enchants<br />
According to the spells available in the game files, most of the trinkets used to boost your mount's speed have been changed to ... enchantments ! <br />
<br />
Old items aren't getting replaced on PTRs, there are only new items, and we still don't know if it's a feature from the 2.4.2 patch or not<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/carrotonastickv2.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/carrotonastickv2.jpg)<br />
<br />
48401 : Carrot on a Stick ([item=11122])<br />
Permanently enchant a mount to increase its mounted speed by 3%. You may only enchant mounts in your own inventory, and enchanting your mount will cause it to become soulbound. Single use.<br />
<br />
Also, it looks like the [item=11122] is now craftable, you will need [item=4470]x1, [item=2321]x1, and [item=13464]x1<br />
<br />
<br />
48403 : Crow Speed<br />
Increases speed in Flight Form and Swift Flight Form by 10%.<br />
<br />
48555 : Skybreaker Whip ([item=32863])<br />
Permanently enchant a mount to increase its mounted speed by 10%. You may only enchant mounts in your own inventory, and enchanting your mount will cause it to become soulbound. Single use.<br />
<br />
48557 : Riding Crop ([item=25653])<br />
Permanently enchant a mount to increase its mounted speed by 10%. You may only enchant mounts in your own inventory, and enchanting your mount will cause it to become soulbound. Single use.</div></div><hr />

What would the purpose of that be, allow leatherworkers to make more money from mount enthusiasts?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing they want to remove mount trinkets in overall, which is good. But is this the way? By permanatly removing them for a mount that you're gonna forget first thing you see a bone dragon in Northrend? I don't like this.<br />
Or may be it's some kind of a small hint to Inscriptions...?</div></div><hr />

why actually?<br />
<br />
When you get new gear, you have to enchant it to make it better.<br />
When you get new mount, you will have to enchant it to travel faster.<br />
<br />
I dont see nothing wrong here - you will get rid of item in your inventory and leatherworkers will have something that will make them money suistainly instead of 1 character/lifetime</div></div><hr />

Yeah like that would ever happen. Just buy one for your epic mount and you're set. And also the cost will come down in WotLK AND they will probably introduce +15% mount speed increase thingos.</div></div><hr />

Sure they are, but they're a BC recipe. So the only people that would be crafting them should be above 60.<br />
<br />
That, and no other crafting recipe in WoW ever &quot;fails to craft&quot;. That's not part of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no its not and your comment clearly stats you have no idea what you talking about.<br />
using a flyform (wich is an instand) or an mount (wich is no instant) is a HUGE difference!<br />
<br />
and that trinket change makes the trinket complete useless<br />
(wich is sad cuase its a reward for one of the few druid quests)<br />
as you have a Talent for using less mana shapeshifting...</div></div><hr />

Again, taking a 10% speed hit, for an instant flight form, is your choice. It's a trade off..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'm lazy and don't feel like doing the epic quest, so I've got the Orc War Puppy (also, I'm not in love with the paladin horse being a spell and using mana as you said). There is no real concern post 62 with the Aura; they won't stack so it won't matter if I can't enchant the Paladin Epic mount. My BElf paladin is nearly 63, and as he is my second paladin I don't see myself levelling another so it isn't a huge concern (for me). It is more of a &quot;I wonder how this will work in the future&quot; kind of thing. If they were going to make the Paladin Mount an item rather than a spell so it can benefit from the new enchant style speed buffs I'll have to clear out a new bank slot for my non-Epic version. Otherwise we'll be enchanting our spells, and that's just Crazy Town.<br />
<br />
Also, who wants to bet the Death Knight will have a summon-able mount? I'd hate to think the Hero Class wouldn't be able to use a Riding Crop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do actually, yes. It frees up another bag slot for important stuff like my 3 different armor sets healing/tanking/grinding (and PvP sometimes) and other raiding paraphernalia. Besides, the mana cost is negligible to be honest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I have to question the usefulness of a trinket that reduces the cost to shapeshift to Flight Form, given that most addons that handle that sort of thing equip the trinkets after you mount/shapeshift. I suppose you could put it in a macro, but if you're already using a macro for shapeshifting, it might be a little tricky to work it in.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't think Blizzard would leave Warlocks, Paladins, and Druids in the lurch here. Either Inscriptions will come through to help in the near future, or they'll provide some sort of quest/item that will allow it.</div></div><hr />

This means that you won't be able to reenchant that mount with +speed. The &quot;Northrend&quot; enchant will be overwritten.<br />

I think you're overreacting. And also note that Blizzard are perfectly capable of reducing the mats cost of items, so maybe it won't cost 90g to make a Riding Crop after this patch.</div></div><hr />

Think outside the box. It was only mentioned that the crop etc would be enchants. For Druids it could be a new skill/spell that you learn, when you Use: the item. Something that is only active when you are in flight form, like a permanent buff.<br />
<br />
In fact, the spells related with the Crop, etc specifically say &quot;Permanently enchant ...&quot; while the Druid one is just an active buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A quick search of wowhead came up with the only possible results of Main Hand weapons being changed. The only &quot;high-level&quot; weapons markes as MainHand are Fist weapons and the crafted 1handers of Axesmithing and Macesmithin (Sword is already one-hand), as well as the MH warlglaive. The only MH only other weapon is Mallet of the tides which would make sense to be changed since King's Defender and Sun Eater are also one-hand<br />
<br />
My guess is the crafted ones are being changed, and quite possibly the fists for more itemization posibilities for meleers, specially Warriors and Enh Shammies who suffer alittle since most fist &quot;sets&quot; are designed with rogues in mind (slow mh-fast oh)<br />

The Inscription mechanic can certainly be used outside of the profession allowing it to be used to perform the same &quot;enchantment&quot; to spells such as the Warlock, Paladin and Druid mounts as the carrot/crop/whip/etc performs on the usable-item-based mounts.<br />
<br />
As for the point about multiple enchantments on mounts in Northrend to allow flying: it's possible they could just use the same mechanic as they did with the heroic MGT attunement applying a permanent buff like Heroic Countenance (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=46591#comments).<br />
<br />
Whether or not they'd start adding these things in an incremental patch has certainly yet to be seen :\.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The flight form spell costs something like 300-400 mana, which you recover in 2s if resto, 5s if balance, and maybe 10s if you're feral (counting the 5s rule after the cast).<br />
Also there's NO realistic situation where you'll be really needing the saved up mana. Even in a duel situation, you could win/lose a fight on a few 100 mana, but you'd be the one starting the fight anyway (flight = not in combat) and using a trinket to save 100 mana is certainly less favourable than using a real battle trinket.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I can think of where the mana reduction would be nice is farming where you are switching between forms a lot. Not exactly sure it would be worth giving up a decent dps trinket though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you be using that at all times, or just when you get in flight form?<br />
<br />
I know that outfitter only switches in the trinket after I'm already in flight form so it wouldnt be saving me any mana, so this trinket would become useless unless I ditched a real trinket.</div></div><hr />

Probably so each faction has a portal close to the center of each continent. Only portal for alliance on kalimdor is Darnassus, and the flight from there to Gadgetzan is a long long one. (Exodar doesn't really count, as you have to take a boat to Auberdine to fly anywhere else).<br />

I'm just curious how this will effect summoned ground mounts (paladins and warlocks). Seems the only one they've considered so far is the epic flight form for druids. Also, what about travel form? Looking forward to seeing better how this works.<br />

<br />
Alright everyone, think about it for a second. Paladin, Warlock and Druid mounts are spells.<br />
<br />
Inscription. By Wrath of the Lich King, you will probably be able to inscribe your mount spell so it goes faster. Also, Paladins get +20% anyway, and I'm sure most Paladins naturally use Crusader Aura when they mount up, like I do.<br />

...except with the Zeppelin. If you take the Silvermoon portal from Shattrath, you can get to the Zeppelin even faster by taking the orb to Ruins of Lordaeron. <br />
While those portal spells might be nice lore-wise, they're not really &quot;balanced&quot; in the game, the Horde one seems to be a lot more useful (until WotLK hits) Though Stormwind/Darkshire was quite near anyway, so one could argument this adjusts the factions' access to Karazhan - but what about Zul'Aman? Teleport: Chillwind Point? :P<br />
<br />
But when you just look at them as a mage questing buff - why? As a levelling mage, you can set your hearth stone in your questing area and yet return to any city at all times, so you'd set it to Stonard while questing in the Swamps - in fact, this even belittles the Swamps' subjective levelling value (not that there were many interesting quests there to begin with - Dustwallow is more lucrative, so from the levelling perspective, Alliance wins) by enabling the player to have another current questing area besides the Swamps. (And the other way around with the Marsh.) Weird logic, but think about it :P</div></div><hr />

Well Paladins won't bother, Crusader Aura ftw. No idea about Warlocks though....</div></div><hr />

Maybe they just didn't replace the old ones.<br />
<br />
Why can people NEVER use addons like Lootlink on PTRs... or at least provide an itemID instead of a screenshot, so we can check for ourselves on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get really what's the point of that. I don't see why a green item (hello vendor) and a 10% chance at a BoJ is unbalancing, and none of the other supply quest is much harder. Why penalize that particular quest?</div></div><hr />

That one is blue, costs 17k yes, but has 20 resilience, not 45... so not new? :)</div></div><hr />

I as a druid got really ruffled by the news that our speed trinkets would turn into enchants. But then I thought about it... Just like the Zhavra mount is probably for WotLK, so probably are the trinket turned enchant. Upon further contemplation, as was mentioned about a lock's mount being a spell, so is Swift Flight Form. So it may be worth thinking that these enchants are actually going to be inscriptions for inscriptionists to make, and not until WotLK. <br />
<br />
The hand-waving-freakoutery can cease for the moment, at least regarding this issue. :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Digitrevx</div><div class="date">2008-05-07, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think outside the box. It was only mentioned that the crop etc would be enchants. For Druids it could be a new skill/spell that you learn, when you Use: the item. Something that is only active when you are in flight form, like a permanent buff.<br />
<br />
In fact, the spells related with the Crop, etc specifically say &quot;Permanently enchant ...&quot; while the Druid one is just an active buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think your just going to have to wait for inscription</div></div><hr />
