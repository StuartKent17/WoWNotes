<br />
&quot;Pre-purchase of World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth makes available the questlines which enable players to access the Highmountain tauren, Lightforged draenei, Nightborne, and Void elves. To unlock Allied Races quest lines, players must have a level 110 character and have met specific questing and reputation requirements on the factions that each Allied Race is aligned with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shady and poorly written</div></div><hr />

Well if you don't need that level 110 character boost, there ya go! Make a 110 horde :)<br />
But in all seriousness, I don't think that is required. I'm pretty sure you just need a 110 toon that has the achievements, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure about the typo regarding Nightfallen vs Nightborne, but in regards to having a character on that faction, yes.<br />
<br />
We have known that you need to have a character on the correct faction for the questline at the Embassy for a long time. The rep and zone (Suramar for Nightborne for example) achievements are only needed on the account. So you can do the rep and zones on an Alliance toon, but you're going to need a Horde toon to do the Nightborne questline at the Horde Embassy that unlocks them. Vice versa for the Alliance Allied Races.</div></div><hr />

Ah really? Well yes, to do the questline you'd need a 110, but that 110 don't need to do the requirements again if you already got them on the other faction side ya? <br />
You just need it to do the questline to officially unlock them</div></div><hr />

You say that like anyone actively playing WoW isn't buying the expansion at launch, anyway. So what's it matter? If you prepurchase you can get early access to features, so... great?<br />
<br />
And pre-purchasing isn't the same as pre-ordering, just FYI. Pre-purchasing is paying upfront to own it before it's actually available, pre-ordering is just setting up an automatic purchase for when it goes on sale.<br />
<br />
I'm just annoyed that they seemingly still don't have a reasonable method for people who want to purchase the CE to get access to the digital exclusive rewards before it goes on sale. I'd love to spend the next few months leveling my new allied race characters, since there's not much else left for me to do with Legion.</div></div><hr />

In addition, right now I can afford to have 40 go missing out of my account, in 6 months time I'll be at a point where I'm rubbing pennies together for heat,</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is smart. It's not like they couldn't put the 'new race quests' in the expansion prepatch. They just use it as bait for the pre-purchase :p<br />

Feeling fine, thanks for asking. Tbh it's a mistake.<br />

With all the system changes and the swing in direction class-wise you'd figure they'd want to give more time to work out the kinks. Just wouldn't be surprised with another buggy release, but if I'm wrong then I'm wrong. /shrug<br />

MMOs have issues on release. Just the way it is.<br />
<br />
Wildstar had a ton.<br />
<br />
FF14 Stormblood literally had an instance issue in which you couldn't progress through the main story due to congestion.<br />
<br />
GW2 had bad connection issues on launch.<br />
<br />
Rift's recent expansion had to disable half of it's expansion content to even work for a few days.<br />
<br />
I could name loads more.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say others didn't have issues, I'm just expecting a more buggy release this go since they are doing far more than just adding sharding. No need to hop on the defense train. :P</div></div><hr />

Where am I defending them?<br />
<br />
I'm just stating it's common for big launches to be buggy. Hence why I pulled up other games as a comparison.<br />
<br />
I bloody hated the WoD launch. Trying to get the Nagrand Scenario with Garrosh done was an absolute Nightmare. Spires was lag central for me as well. Half the time I ended up dying because it was that bad.<br />
<br />
Legion was actually pretty decent because of the sharding. Although I remember some issues cropping up a week or two in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just cautious since they are doing the realm change (no more pvp realms) and what seems to be rather extensive class changes since they mentioned &quot;sometimes you have to bring the class, not the player&quot; line. Coupled with the relatively short time frame (since alpha recently started), seems like a recipe for disaster as it were.

The change shouldn't be too bad on the servers. The shards still exist so if one instance of a zone is overcrowded people will be moved into that one.<br />
<br />
It worked for Legion so it shouldn't cause any issues with BFA. But all we can do is wait and see really.</div></div><hr />

You just need it to do the questline to officially unlock them<br />
<br />
Correct. If you got Argussian Reach exalted and finished the Argus quests on your Tauren Warrior, you can walk into the Alliance Embassy on your fresh 110 Night Elf Druid and do the Void Elf unlock questline (they're short and neat stories). Likewise if you got Highmountain exalted and did the Highmountain zone achievement on your Night Elf Druid you can walk into the Horde Embassy on a fresh 110 Blood Elf Demon Hunter and do the Highmountain Tauren unlock questline.</div></div><hr />

I've played the other sub-races on the alpha, and they are more developed. Seriously, the void elf is a blood elf with blue hair.<br />

<br />
Maybe not but they've had other gimmicks long before WoD. Annual Pass being a major one.<br />
<br />
And why not offer an incentive to preorder? Does everything they do these days have to have an ulterior motive according to you?<br />
<br />
FF14 gave you some XP gain earrings and a Wind up Minion for preordering Stormblood. As well as a headstart on the expansion.<br />
<br />
GW2 gave you preorder bonuses for the expansions such as a title.<br />
<br />
You act as if Blizzard are the only company in the world who do this. Yes it will drive sales. That is the whole point of offering pre order bonuses. To make money. Like any business does. A company is not here to be your best friend. A company exists to make money in their field of business to stay in business.<br />
<br />
There is literally no ulterior motive. It's to drive sales and generate revenue as well as offer the playerbase something. Â£5 more for 4 sub races and a free 110 boost isn't that bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And why not offer an incentive to preorder? Does everything they do these days have to have an ulterior motive according to you?<br />
<br />
FF14 gave you some XP gain earrings and a Wind up Minion for preordering Stormblood. As well as a headstart on the expansion.<br />
<br />
GW2 gave you preorder bonuses for the expansions such as a title.<br />
<br />
You act as if Blizzard are the only company in the world who do this. Yes it will drive sales. That is the whole point of offering pre order bonuses. To make money. Like any business does. A company is not here to be your best friend. A company exists to make money in their field of business to stay in business.<br />
<br />
There is literally no ulterior motive. It's to drive sales and generate revenue as well as offer the playerbase something. Â£5 more for 4 sub races and a free 110 boost isn't that bad.<br />
<br />
Dude, all they are about is $. Look at the token price increase, shop price increase, the sub increase, the server transfer increase, pre-order price increase. All of this is recent. Sub price was flat for a decade. The game is changing into a pay to win model before our eyes. Won't be long before you can buy legendaries in the shop. I mean, why not? People will lap up that shit. It'll destroy the game but no-one seems to care about that anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you have a direct source Legendaries will happen let's not start wildly speculating.<br />
<br />
Pre Orders do not have any ulterior motive as you claim. It has the simple motive of generating revenue. Like EVERY business out there does.</div></div><hr />

Nightborne are a total rehash of Night Elves. Only difference is the idle animation and aged-up ugly faces.<br />
Highmountain are an obvious rehash.<br />
Zandalari are unique insofar as having better back posture and walking animations. Theyâre also the only Horde Allied race worth playing,</div></div><hr />

Preorder gimmicks are fine. Preorder gimmicks for 50 dollars on a game that already costs 15 a month, for an expansion that is 8 months away and adds no New major features beyond character reskins....<br />
<br />
....well, that's a problem. The timeframe in particular reeks of financial staff meddling. An 8 month presale in the MMO industry is never a good sign. And when you look at the low art quality and slapped together features/story for BFA, it starts to paint a clear picture.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is shifting resources away from Wow. They are willing to milk it for as long as they can, but are no longer willing to invest heavily in it. The company gets a higher return for their investment on low cost, low maintenance games like Heart hstone and OW. And they know it. Take a look at the merch they're pushing at cons for further proof.</div></div><hr />

Preorders have included a mount, pet, and character boost for quite a while now. :rolleyes: Gimmick or standard?<br />

On the one hand you make some baseless comment about how this is somehow a cashgrab because &quot;wow is failing&quot; on the other you make equally baseless claims that resources are being shifted away from WoW and forth minimal effort for maximum gains.<br />

Welcome to the ignore list.<br />
<br />
So you do have data? Please share your analysis with class.<br />
<br />
As entertaining as that tirade would be, I'll save you the trouble. Activision-Blizzard does not break down their financial information based on title. So it would be impossible for you to come up with any reasonable figures on cost, or revenue, to be able to make such bold claims or to even do any sort of ROI or CBA. Undoubtedly whatever creative math you were doing is inevitably based on some outdated speculation as to sub numbers.<br />
<br />
You don't have a time frame for this analysis.<br />
<br />
You don't know what the size of the WoW team is now... or what it was. (if it has changed at all)<br />
<br />
You don't have any clue what the budget for BfA is, what Legion was, etc. Or if they made that budget.<br />
<br />
What about operating budget for the game?<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and learn when to quit. Instead of trying to belittle any sort of opposition that doesn't take your bullshit opinion as to the financial health of the game at face value. If you were really as mature as you are trying to make yourself out to be... you would have conceded that it was nothing more than an opinion from the get go, assuming you responded at all.<br />
<br />
Relevant and reliable data... you don't have it. Stop trying to paint yourself as an expert, or even some enthusiast... If I had to guess I'd bank on your business knowledge and investment acumen coming from nothing more than working a cash register at some retail store... possibly one where they sell video games. Best Buy, Target, Gamestop?... don't quit your day job.</div></div><hr />

You have to level that specific race to 110. So assuming you got the xpac today. You will need to level 4 more 110s to collect each set. (boosting doesn't count)</div></div><hr />

If i understand it correct the Zandalari are a new faction, they will not be playable at all. But if you get the digital deluxe edition you get the Zandalari Raptor mount. Not sure if that also counts for the physical CE.</div></div><hr />

Funny that this is the first time that the requirement of playing through the respective questline and grinding reputation actually fits 100% to the reward. You know, to ally with other people, you have to show them that you care for them and support them. Also, since at least Nightborne and Highmountain Tauren requirements have already been included in the Pathfinder I, chances are high that most people already have these. And regarding the Aliance races - you get these two pretty much by completing the storyline and doing some emissaries. It's not a big deal. I am not a big fan of forcing people to do some achievements to unlock things, if these achevements are not connected to the reward - but in this case, the requrements fit as good as it's possible.<br />
<br />
How can people complain about content draught if they don't even finish the questlines of the game?<br />

It's probably a thing of perspective and posture, both stand a bit behind Sylvanas, the camera angle is skewed, and both are hunched, while she is standing upright. The only way they could make Sylvanas stand out between these large males. Also the only thing to work out for boy-king Anduin. Kinda hilarious. :D<br />

Beside that: Especially the Alliance wallpaper greatly reminds me of the military advertising snippets from the &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; movie. I wonder if this is a coincidence, or probably even a reference. You know, fascist military dominated culture and stuff.<br />

Yea I know but I was comparing troll to forsaken that was right behind him, and Tauren to the orc that was behind him. considering the position, both Tauren and Troll should be at the very least of the size of Saurfang. But that would ruin composition, and Forsaken dude (is he really wearing high heels? O.o?) is way too big compared to troll, but if he would be scaled down it would also be error in composition.</div></div><hr />
