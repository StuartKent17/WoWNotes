Guild Pane Still Exists<br />
Some players have noticed that old guild pane features didn't make it to the community system. The old guild pane with features such as sorting by last online is still there, just type &quot;/guildroster&quot;. Thanks to Annaisha for the tip!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way to use the old permissions system with more fine grained permissions, your only option now is the grouped permissions. This means you can't do things like allow members to edit their own notes anymore.<br />

Legion Companion App Change<br />
Thanks to DarthRigo (https://twitter.com/DarthRigo) who posted a thread on our forums (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2412920-Blizzard-broke-the-Wow-app-(intentionally)?p=49765173&amp;viewfull=1#post49765173) and tweeted BlizzardCS (https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS), we have learned that the switch characters button in the Legion Companion app was intentionally removed. It is now a little more involved to switch between your characters.<br />

Wargames in Battle for Azeroth<br />
Wargames aren't in the core UI, but you can type /wg to challenge the targeted player. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1095894-wargames-removed-in-bfa/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765456758?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Battle Chest and the &quot;New&quot; System<br />
The Battle Chest basically doesn't exist as a standalone purchase anymore.<br />
<br />
You make your Starter Edition, you add game time and then you immediately have access to all expansions up to, and including, Legion - no need to actually make a separate purchase of the Battle Chest anymore in order to upgrade the account. The only thing you would need to purchase separately is Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, if a player wants to jump straight into the latest action on a new account - they can buy the Complete Collection which includes 30 days of game-time (so unlocking access to all previous expansions) and Battle for Azeroth (including the level 110 character boost).

My guild found out last night that the community guild window doesn't account for merged servers when inviting. Meaning, a person from merged server A is unable to invite someone from merged server B via that interface because it doesn't account for the hyphen servername at the end of that person's name. We had to type it in manually for every person. This is a problem that the old window didn't have. They created a new problem.<br />
Also, the window just looks bad in general. The old interface is much better.</div></div><hr />

You can switch to your last 2 that you used previously. The 'Switch Character' button has been replaced by the 'log out' button. If you want your full character list, you have to log out. Upon logging in - you will be presented with the character list.<br />

Unless of course you did the quest line pre-8.0 in which case you phase into a version of the area where all of the mobs are dead already - a second middle finger to players who have done the quests already.</div></div><hr />

Also, good job Blizzard for a completely meaningless hotfix in regards to the centaur clan factions. If you haven't done the quest, you're going to do it and be done. If you did the quest prior to patch 8.0.1, you are still out of luck because you are phased into a Shok’Thokar where all the mobs are dead.</div></div><hr />

For me, how it works is I log out, and when I log back in it automatically logs me in to the character I just left. Leaving me stuck on my mage character since the update.<br />

I can't watch that show because the host is the most awkward person I have ever seen. He is never in sync with his guests and is always playing catch up to what they say. It's even worse when he hosts Method and you see the stark contrast to natural leader type people in RogerBrown and Sco. The host ends up looking like that kid who always had his lunch money stolen by the jocks during recess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole prepatch is a complete s*** show of bugs/untested things, even today after the several hotfixes.<br />
<br />
The Alpha and then Beta was buggy as hell, it's clear they have pushed this release 6-9 months ahead schedule of where it could realistically have been done.<br />
<br />
Things are dumbed down, mechanics are changed to the worse (stat scaling, no real stats on items besides the main pieces of gear blizzard controls throughout the expansion (neck) that has the majority of the stat budgets over all items, where each individual item has next to none.<br />
<br />
The mobile app where they made it next to impossible if you have more than 2 alts, since you need to relog and sign in with the authenticator to switch chars around.<br />

<br />
From the way it's worded, it sounds like once you subscribed at least once, even if you then cancel your subscription, everything up to and including legion will be free to play. That is, if they use the word &quot;unlock&quot; the way it's supposed to be used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change to the app in particular is particularly disgusting. Whoever is the UX department there needs to be fucking fired for even suggesting it, much less it actually going live. Just from a usability standpoint its a fucking terrible choice. What a bunch of assclowns.</div></div><hr />

Well this is a bullcrap - I also hope this do not include streaming from own PC to a phone, since my PC is not third-party. Why would they restrict that anyway? So people with shitty laptops couldn't play at all?<br />

What’s with the beardos? Too lazy to shave millenials?<br />

What is wrong with beards? Are you man, and are you ashamed of your manliness?</div></div><hr />
