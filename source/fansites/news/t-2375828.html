Activision Blizzard Earnings Call<br />
The Activision Blizzard quarterly earnings call didn't have a ton of news this time around. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is expected to grow in 2018 with the release of World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth this summer.<br />
Activision Blizzard had 385 million Monthly Active Users in the quarter, up from 384 million last quarter. <br />
Blizzard had 40 million MAUs for the quarter. While down sequentially, this is the 6th quarter in a row with 40 million or more MAUs primarily driven by Overwatch and Hearthstone<br />
For the second quarter in a row, players spent over 50 minutes per day in Activision, Blizzard, and King games, in line with some of the most engaging online connected platforms in the world. <br />
The inaugural season of the Overwatch League started on January 10 with 12 world-class team owners from across the globe, multiple league and team-level sponsors, a premium viewing experience and a robust distribution strategy. In its first week, the Overwatch League reached more than 10 million unique viewers across the world with an average audience of more than 280,000 on a per minute basis.<br />
Blizzard delivered record segment revenues and operating income for a year with no major game release, as they continued to deliver continuous content across franchises including Overwatch, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft<br />
The Overwatch League has met and exceeded expectations. The focus now is on audience growth.<br />

Was too much to keep up with and loot crates are locked down upon more nowadays than when it first came out<br />
<br />
(Side note, I feel like a lot of thes comments tend to focus on [Why is X on the frontpage] even though its appropriate, like ppl still do that with DLC and its WoW-related 100% lol. Not all content is gonna be for you. I think a variety of content is good, whether it be tweets, PTR videos, polls, addon spotlight, podcasts, comics, etc. MMOC probably isnt a huge team so I think they do a great job with what they have to work with. Daily posts for going on a decade now and it's all free. They've been consistent with a variety approach since the start. That said, its fine to give feedback if you don't like something on the frontpage, but also try to say what you do like at the same time, and also be understanding of the variety approach)</div></div><hr />

Because it's Survival's Serpent Sting and they're still a melee spec.</div></div><hr />

With the first exp. of HS they killed their own f2p playerbase. Now it is just a money sink. You cannot even reach rank20 with basic decks. The playerbase goes down slowly until only the payers stay. <br />
But who cares at the end of the day. They only use 5% or less for developing by the income of HS.</div></div><hr />

I hope so as well, and it's a copy aside from the casting and sound.<br />

<br />
I think the new one looks very original, there is no spell in the game with that level of detail, the old one had no impact animation or barely had one but now you can actually see the dark fire bursting when it hits the target, it gives meaning to the spell's name if you ask me.<br />
Besides, i think the angle didn't really do it justice, here is a gif from the alpha: https://gfycat.com/AncientImmediateKob<br />
<br />
Pay attention to the details...incinerate might not look gigantic but it has a lot of details in the animation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually think the impact effect is too good looking, considering Incinerate fits into the rotation as fairly weak filler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on your talent choices, as things stand now on alpha it can be your strongest AoE spell since it hits multiple targets close to the main one(it fires multiple projectiles).</div></div><hr />

I honestly agree. It's only early stages of alpha, so I'm not going to judge them TOO hard right now.. But they've put them off so long and I expected way more. Disappointing right now.</div></div><hr />
