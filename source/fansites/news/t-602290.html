Actually, it seems that the headless horseman isn't really headless, and he will have tons of fire attacks.

the graveyards come a little late, eh?</div></div><hr />

Will be nice to level an alt when the changes come, will also be nice not having to run the entire barrens when you die in an awkward place! :P</div></div><hr />

The new goblin town in Dustwallow Marsh<br />
+30% XP rewards on quests, with less XP needed to level from 0 to 60<br />
<br />

<br />
Both will be released in 2.3 or 2.4, don't know if it will be at the same time</div></div><hr />
