<br />
Alterac Pass Map<br />
Alterac Pass (https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/battlegrounds/alterac-pass/) is an Alertac Valley inspired map, with Vanndar Stormpike (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vanndar_Stormpike) and Drek'Thar in place of the normal Cores at each base.<br />
<br />
<br />
The generals charge and whirlwind, but leash if you try to move too far, just like they do in AV. <br />
After leashing, the generals will begin to regenerate health. <br />
For each keep you destroy, the generals will lose some armor. <br />
Each team has prison camp objectives on the opposite faction's side of the map. <br />
You must channel to start the prisoner escape and then maintain control until they escape. A single click will stop the escape, so enemy players must be kept away from the camps.<br />
After the prisoner escapes, a Cavalry will be summoned in each lane.<br />
The cavalry will grant increased damage and movement speed to nearby allied heroes and minions. This bonus increases with each subsequent objective completion within a game. <br />
The map also has two Gnoll siege camps and two Ice Giant boss camps. <br />
The Gnolls have a cleave attack and stacking armor debuff to damaged targets.<br />
The Ice Giants are similar to the Grave Golems on Cursed Hollow, but have an Ice Shard ability that will damage and slow in an area. <br />
There are mud pits around the objective area, which have a stacking movement speed debuff that is applied while you stand in them.<br />
<br />

At first I felt the same, but that's because she doesn't use the generic Draenei model and they tried to make her look different. It will take a bit of time to get used to.</div></div><hr />

The Spirit Healer is neutral, but Valeera is loyal to the Alliance despite being a Blood Elf due to past associations with Varian.<br />
<br />
But she's not Alliance, she makes that very clear at various points throughout her story. Heck, just look at the quote they used on the poster with her, she's even saying she's neutral there and yet they put her on the Alliance?</div></div><hr />

In the new book (Before the Storm) she works as a spy for Anduin. Can't go more Alliance than that. Let's face it, Anduins' potential is simply too big.</div></div><hr />

Agree. It almost looks like they specifically made it so the Harley Quinn looking skin would more normal. Or someone just tossed some horns and goat legs on Poppy from League of legends.<br />

Auriel - Spirithealer just isn't Alliance specific.<br />
Valeera - Just another tier set. Now Tier 1 instead of Tier 2.... Af all sets the one being known for shoulder boobies. :P<br />
<br />
Varian and Vandaar are great though. And so are all of the Horde skins. I really love the idea of Sapper Junkrat, being a goblin steering a small mech, instead of just painting him green similiar to the Fallen One skin. Everything of him is amazing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
As for Yrel... She is probably the least relevant paladin character, and Draenei. Especially since she doesn't even have a Main Universe role. Other then than that, she looks ok. Don't know, what to think of the Poppy-Harley Quinn-Skin though.<br />
But she is a tank, so Assassine Tirion as the Ashbringer can still come. Hopefully with a Scarlet Highlord skin, to depicture both Ashbringers.</div></div><hr />
