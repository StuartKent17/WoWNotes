<br />
Why the hell would I rejoice? <br />
<br />
1. It looks like they reused the original zone map.<br />
2. If they really want to make it realistic, the Tarren Mill guards have to be way tougher than the Southshore guards, to where you can literally train the guars from TM to SS where they proceed to kill everything in SS for you. <br />
<br />
I don't miss Tarren Mill. I miss South Shore, but this won't give it back to me. <br />
<br />
The ONE good thing was that - as far as I recall - this was prior to the bane of world PVP - resilience. <br />
<br />
This used to be set to Down with the Sickness but it was slightly cool so of course youtube dinged it. I'm the paladin in the video.<br />

In Ashran there are various pieces of equipment you can get that have special effects and spells that only work within Ashran.<br />
One of these gives Paladins &quot;Jailor's Judgement&quot; which can teleport enemy players into a prison located within your faction's base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why the hell would I rejoice?<br />
<br />
Why indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. It looks like they reused the original zone map.<br />
<br />
How... Is that an issue? By the sounds of it you want this to be as close to the original as possible? So surely reusing the map would be a good thing?<br />
<br />
<br />
2. If they really want to make it realistic, the Tarren Mill guards have to be way tougher than the Southshore guards, to where you can literally train the guars from TM to SS where they proceed to kill everything in SS for you. <br />
<br />
Again, I assume you mean realistic as in close to the original. In that case... No, that would just be dumb. Remember that Hillsbrad was never meant to be the PvP zone it became. It was a fortunate coincidence that these two faction hubs became the center of World PvP for some time. The hubs and guards being of different levels was, if anything, an unfortunate coincidence. If this place was designed with PvP in mind, which it seems to be this time, the guards would, of course, be the same levels.</div></div><hr />

No, it's Gul'dan with a Shadowmoon Clan staff, which makes sense since he used to be a Shadowmoon orc.<br />
<br />

Is it possible that maybe we get a minor content patch in WoD that takes place on current Azeroth, where Varian decides to make good on his &quot;we must contain Sylvanas&quot; lines from ending of Siege? If he wanted to do that, reclaiming Southshore for the Alliance (and cleaning it up) would be a great place to start.

Please yes. I hope they'll do something with Stromgarde, too, at some point. Sadly I don't think that ll be the case, but one can hope. On the other hand - they also went back to Azeroth in TBC for sunwell. Might be a repeat of sorts? I think that worked best tbh - explore new world but also refer back to old one and the changes there (if they're reading this: do something about poor low-res IF as well in a patch)</div></div><hr />
