Blue posts<br />
Dungeon System and LFG Channel<br />
I don't think people queuing for an instance they don't really want to do is good for the LFG tool, especially if there are folks legitimately trying to run that dungeon. I realize it's a way to opt into the LFG channel rather than just having it be global for everyone, but it's a clunky way. With cross-realm LFG there is also a much higher chance you actually will find a group even for obscure dungeons.<br />
<br />
I think there is some legitimacy to the players who want to just monitor what's going on while on an alt, but again the groups will typically get filled so fast that there is less need to do something while you wait, unless you're talking about raids, in which case you can sit on an alt and browse who is in the channel. Just remember that if everyone is browsing and nobody is listing themselves that it will be harder to form groups.<br />
<br />
The reality that some players play many characters regularly is something we are trying to embrace more and more. We are putting more emphasis on your account and less on your actual character, so we hope to chip away at those moments where you feel punished for being on character A instead of character B (such as trying to find a group in this case).

Quel'delar<br />
Quel'delar questline requirements<br />
This comes from 5-player dungeons so it won't be as gargantuan as the shifting sands or as material heavy as the Hand of Ragnaros, but it will still require running a few instances and some dedication just to start it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677333066-queldelar-the-sister-blade.html))<br />
<br />
Quel'delar Stats<br />
We will post details on the stats before the patch launches, but you'll have to wait for now - sorry, this is the only answer available at the moment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677333066-queldelar-the-sister-blade.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking / Chill of the Throne<br />
Gear and Avoidance numbers going too high<br />
Of course it was &quot;our fault.&quot; We're not blaming anyone. I was just explaining why avoidance still got so high despite our best intentions. You may have scaled the gear down had you been in our shoes, but we picked the numbers we thought would be enticing enough to get players to try the hard modes while still allowing everyone to feel like they could upgrade their gear.<br />
<br />
It wasn't inevitable either. We debated Chill of the Throne long and hard. We easily could have gone the other way. We think the encounters will be more fun with the current implementation though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Chill of the Throne<br />
1. Can we expect more unavoidable, devastating melee-based attacks in ICC? If so, what point do they serve from a design stand point? <br />
1. Probably. They serve as challenges that your group needs to overcome by making sure enough healers are focused on the big damage spike and cooldowns (the tank’s or external ones) are used appropriately. If you could avoid those attacks they would need to hit for even harder to compensate. If you could avoid those hits, then sometimes you would just let lucky and make it through the encounter unscathed and other times you'd get gibbed. Believe me; you want those to be unavoidable. <br />
<br />
2. Are we finally going to get away from the 2 hits back to back will gib the tank situation we are in now? <br />
2. The idea behind the Chill is to lower boss damage per hit but keep damage per time the same overall. The reason I caveat that statement so much is I know that we’re going to see lots of tanks that die in Icecrown and then ask us to nerf the encounters or buff their tanks. The purpose of these changes is not to prevent tank deaths. You will die. Probably a lot. You are going into the Lich King’s home after all. <br />
<br />
3. How are you going to handle Chill of the Throne when the pre-Cata patch comes out and we lose another ~18% avoidance when Defense goes away as a stat? <br />
3. I dunno. I imagine we will just drop it. We’ll have a lot of fixin’ up to do before Cat is ready to go live. <br />
<br />
Parry vs. Dodge<br />
Tanks don’t stack parry because it’s more expensive to gear for parry than dodge (and usually gearing for armor and health when available are superior to both). The reason parry &gt; dodge (which makes it more expensive) is because parry gives you a slight threat increase over dodge because of the weapon swing speedup. The “parry gibs” phenomenon you are describing was a much bigger deal in the age of crushing blows (which ironically you are nostalgic for). Today, the increased damage that a parry-stacking tank would suffer from parry speedup is pretty trivial. Besides, we turn it off on many bosses for which it would cause a problem. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Effective Health<br />
Well, to be fair most theorycrafting tanks on Tankspot and other places who really understand the concept of EH won’t tell you it’s the only thing that matters, just that it is very important. The problem is that some players who perhaps don’t understand the theorycrafting as well try to take the notion to illogical extremes.<br />
<br />
If we buffed DK parry to 99% and dropped their health 5K then it would be a huge EH nerf but they would probably be the best tanks by a wide margin. Now that's a very contrived scenario but you can't argue that just because tank avoidance happens to be close right now that avoidance is irrelevant as a stat when determining survivability. <br />
<br />
[...] This thread was yet another “my EH is too low, please buff” thread. I wanted to point out why there was a disconnect between many of the threads on this forum and the developers. The disconnect comes in too many attempts to convert cooldowns as different as AD and VB into EH, stack rack the tanks based on that questionable estimate, and then complain about the order.<br />
<br />
The discussion got distracted a little with the “GC says avoidance is better than stamina” nonsense, but the above was my original intent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677232049-tank-eh-being-looked-at-in-33-at-all.html))<br />
<br />
Avoidance and Spikes<br />
I think what you are comparing here is a tank with high avoidance to one with lower avoidance. Your definition of &quot;spiky&quot; here is just that the tank with lower avoidance gets hit more often. That's usually not what players are talking about though. If you compare a tank with 50% avoidance to a tank with 0% avoidance, then the latter guy is taking a ton more damage, but he is taking the same damage every hit. For every unit of time, the incoming damage is the same, which is generally easier for healers and the tank himself to plan around.<br />
<br />
When people say high avoidance causes spikes, what they usually mean is that a tank who chooses avoidance over mitigation (armor) will avoid some damage completely but then suddenly get clobbered. That's a spike. By reducing the amount of attacks that a boss fails to land (because of dodge), we can lower the amount of damage that a boss does per hit while still keeping the same boss damage over time. We need to keep the same damage over time because that is scaled to healing over time. If we just nerfed dodge without adjusting boss damage, then we'd just be killing tanks more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Bosses in Icecrown Citadel and effects of Chill of the Throne<br />
1) Bosses won't swing faster. More of their swings will hit.<br />
2) Tanks that avoid less are generally easier for healers to heal (provided the numbers aren't just too great).<br />
3) Tank healing was fun in Sunwell, IMO. Sunwell was challenging. That's what a lot of players are looking for in the final raid tier. If you don't like the challenge of healing a tank then I'm not sure why you'd want to be a healer. Now as I've said, we're not saying Icecrown is only for the Sunwell crowd. But I am pretty convinced there are going to be a lot of &quot;Icecrown is too hard because my tank died&quot; posts here when it goes live.

Paladins too defensive in PvP<br />
I'll add it's also a problem where paladins as a whole are too defensive and not just the Protection spec ones. You see people describing fighting a Retribution paladin as a three phase boss fight. You might get them down, but then they can reset the fight with Lay on Hands. You get them down again and they bubble and heal. Compare this to an Arms warrior -- do they do great damage in PvP? Yes. Are they invulnerable? No. It's cool for paladins to care more about healing than do warriors, for I hope obvious reasons. However, if you are up against a Holy paladin, you should know that one of your greatest challenges should be dealing with their capacity to heal. If you are up against a Prot paladin, you should be concerned with their capacity to take hits. If you are up against a Ret paladin, you should be concerned with how much damage they should deal. You should not, generally, be nearly as concerend about the Prot's ability to self-heal or the Ret's ability to tank you. <br />
<br />
I said this recently, but to reiterate, for most of the other hybrids, picking a role in a fight is much more of a commitment. Sure the Arms warrior can go Defensive Stance and put on a shield, but that doesn't turn them into a Prot warrior. Nobody is super concerned about Feral druids shifting out to heal. We had big problems with DKs earlier being able to tank and deal damage with the same set of tools, but that's in a better place now. Shaman maybe the only other class besides paladins that are able to shift on the fly from dps to healing, but with their mail armor and lack of major defensive cooldowns they just don't feel as hard to kill.

<br />
Don't nerf me bro!<br />
This is just “don’t nerf me, bro” talk. We have been so gentle with paladin nerfs because we’ve been so concerned with returning to lolret, that paladins as a class are still very powerful in end-game LK in both PvE and PvP. Yes, it’s not fun to be nerfed. We get that. There is very little evidence we have over-nerfed paladins at any time in the past couple of years. There is plenty of evidence that we haven’t nerfed them enough. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677862444-blizzards-vision.html))<br />

So two lives compared to the other persons 1 is acceptable? If I were a ret pally I would rather have less survivability and greatly increased damage than QQ about a spell that was made with the intent that it be used on other people being reworked so that it must be used on other people, and not ask for a buff to balance out the nerf.</div></div><hr />

China is in a particularly volatile political situation right now, for the last decade or two the Chinese people have tolerated the governments oppressive reign over basic freedoms and rights for the economic stability and prosperity china's rising has brought on. After the financial markets collapsed, however, Chinese holdings in the US (which were valued at close to a trillion dollars) plummeted, and the Chinese markets have been hit hard. The government has put together a stimulus package, making the US bailout look like children’s allowance, in a desperate attempt to insulate their markets and maintain the positive economic and social outlook.<br />
<br />
It took nearly 3 years for Google to reach Chinese markets simply because the blocking software and technology that the Chinese government required was so stringent. The &quot;green chip&quot; project just this year placing internet blocking software in every computer sold was scraped for personal buyers but installed on every public / government PC. With the Uighur ethic violence still fresh as well as Tibetan protest / demonstrations it is unlikely that china would approve of a software medium that offers such freedom of expression and lack of monitoring / moderation as WoW.<br />
<br />
It's quite sad that a country as large and as advanced as china can still be so politically and socially repressed.<br />
<br />

China is in a particularly volatile political situation right now, for the last decade or two the Chinese people have tolerated the governments oppressive reign over basic freedoms and rights for the economic stability and prosperity china's rising has brought on. After the financial markets collapsed, however, Chinese holdings in the US (which were valued at close to a trillion dollars) plummeted, and the Chinese markets have been hit hard. The government has put together a stimulus package, making the US bailout look like children’s allowance, in a desperate attempt to insulate their markets and maintain the positive economic and social outlook.<br />
<br />
It took nearly 3 years for Google to reach Chinese markets simply because the blocking software and technology that the Chinese government required was so stringent. The &quot;green chip&quot; project just this year placing internet blocking software in every computer sold was scraped for personal buyers but installed on every public / government PC. With the Uighur ethic violence still fresh as well as Tibetan protest / demonstrations it is unlikely that china would approve of a software medium that offers such freedom of expression and lack of monitoring / moderation as WoW.<br />
<br />
It's quite sad that a country as large and as advanced as china can still be so politically and socially repressed.<br />

For ret nerfs: Pally's are a very sensitive class to nerf or buff so no matter what happens people wont be happy but I agree it's kinda crazy to have to fight a pally just to get him down low enough for him to bubble and heal up. <br />
<br />
Against: It's WotLk, the Pally and DK expansion. Now I played a paladin for a long time and it isn't fair everyone treats them like their rogues (ya know have been overpowered FOREVER and blizz wont do anything to them) for a long time they were just buff machines and punching bags. I'm glad to see they got the spotlight for a little bit but seeing how the community reacts to classes they are used to loling at getting buffed i'm very scared for Shaman. I used to wish for buffs each patch in BC but in WotLk i'm actually glad when they dont change anything. Everyones goal should be balance not the destruction of a class that isn't yours.<br />
<br />

On the patch notes, does this mean us Retting Paladins will be getting an attack based ability, however paltry? Trivializing most movement impairing effects while being immune to all kinds of damage every 5 minutes =/= one man army.<br />

I'll add it's also a problem where paladins as a whole are too defensive and not just the Protection spec ones. You see people describing fighting a Retribution paladin as a three phase boss fight. You might get them down, but then they can reset the fight with Lay on Hands. You get them down again and they bubble and heal.<br />
Blizzard finally admits the problem with fighting Paladins in PVP.</div></div><hr />

Today, the increased damage that a parry-stacking tank would suffer from parry speedup is pretty trivial. Besides, we turn it off on many bosses for which it would cause a problem<br />
<br />
The final blow against those suckers against dw tanking (&quot;PARRY GIBZ U DIE NOOB LOLOLOL&quot;)<br />
<br />
DK tanks frost DW with 2%+2% parry enchants best Sindragosa tanks? for the high parry and Frigid Dreadplate and Improved Frost Presence and Acclimation?<br />
<br />
I say YES<br />
<br />
Edit: i have to correct myself here, because there is also a 4% parry enchant for 2h (even better), anyways its good for dw to be viable. Unholy tanking with Magic Suppresion and Anti magic zone could be nice also</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the China subject, this will be a bad day for Blizzard unfortunatly, if they loose their buissness base in China they may loose alot of revenue. Though I have heard of duing the WotLK crisis, and unable to disrespect the dead (Death Knights) Many chinese switched to Korean and other asian countries servers that were outside of the embargo. Perhaps if Blizz is lucky the people struck by the Chinese ban hammer will go there instead. That communist Mao and his reign are even now cutting into wow... and I remember a person in the white house, who made a speach to a bunch of High School students, saying that the two people she looked up to the most were Mother Teresa Mao Zedong. Heaven forbid if America began to slowly turn into a communist nation, with people in charge who look up to people like that... but thats politics, and I've said too much.<br />
<br />
To get off that subject, and back to the nerf on Pallies. I hope they do stick with it! There is nothing worse then haveing a 3 phase boss fight just to take a single pally down, and like 10 horde against them. Only to end up with them bubbling and hearthing back home. Thats almost as bad as a bosses enrage timer.</div></div><hr />

I know QQ some more, BUT i am pretty upset about this. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER in 14 years of playing RPG games, be it online in DnD or anything that I can be a paladin in have I EVER been able to NOT cast Lay on Hands on myself. You want the game to be bland or you want each class to have somethign that makes us special. Me personally I am a prot pally and it hurts me so much to see you guys move us closer to a war than as our own individual class. This nerf is completely retarded and I can say that this will greatly decrease my wanting to play any of blizz's future games because your taking what makes a pally a pally out of the game essentially. I am extremely offended by it. All I guess I'm really trying to say is if you want to not let us cast Lay on Hands on our selves might as well take our class and make it warrior, o and then take portals and food away from mages so you can finish destroying this game.</div></div><hr />

Sure the Arms warrior can go Defensive Stance and put on a shield, but that doesn't turn them into a Prot warrior. Nobody is super concerned about Feral druids shifting out to heal. We had big problems with DKs earlier being able to tank and deal damage with the same set of tools, but that's in a better place now. Shaman maybe the only other class besides paladins that are able to shift on the fly from dps to healing, but with their mail armor and lack of major defensive cooldowns they just don't feel as hard to kill.&quot;<br />

Last time I checked, boomkins were pretty good at switching from DPS to heals. Oh wait, that's right. Boomkins are still unplayable in PvP. So much so, you refuse to recognize them as a spec completely. /Sigh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">divinum</div><div class="date">2009-11-02, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I said this recently, but to reiterate, for most of the other hybrids, picking a role in a fight is much more of a commitment. Sure the Arms warrior can go Defensive Stance and put on a shield, but that doesn't turn them into a Prot warrior. Nobody is super concerned about Feral druids shifting out to heal. We had big problems with DKs earlier being able to tank and deal damage with the same set of tools, but that's in a better place now. Shaman maybe the only other class besides paladins that are able to shift on the fly from dps to healing, but with their mail armor and lack of major defensive cooldowns they just don't feel as hard to kill.<br />
<br />
Paladins have bubble + heals<br />
Warriors have intervene, charge, intercept, mortal strike, hamstring<br />
Druids have snare and bearform + insta cyclone every crit or whatever (insta naturespells) + charge<br />
Shamans should get some buffs for enhancement+ exept that they wolfs heal the all the time + bloodlust + insta heals<br />
<br />
Blizzard, remove our bubble, give us shorter cooldowns on our &quot;CC&quot;, an interupt, intercept, ms effect. Then its fine lol<br />
<br />
PS: and yes you can put the judgement undispellable and put the ms effect on it and remove seal of command, Put charge/intervene/intercept there. and make exorcism interupting.</div></div><hr />

Other melee classes:<br />
Dks got nerf for good, they feel better now, they are just like any other class.<br />
Shamans enhancement can heal themselves , but wear mail, LACK OF STUNS, and are not so much defensive, I could say is kinda easy to kill them. Oh yeah, Shamans have to choose between buffing totems or defensive totems or offensive totems, while paladins can start the battle FULLY BUFFED wtf?!<br />
Rogues and cat druid stun the shit out of you but are squishy and Rogue can't heal themselves<br />
Warriors wear armor but at least can't heal themself<br />
<br />
AND NONE OF THESE CLASSES HAVE STUPID BUBBLE!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
I think paladins need a nerf like , right now, I'm glad Blue post FINALLY says something, I've been QQing forever, I quitted for a while and now I read Paladins will be nerf, about time, more more nerfs please, or just delete bubble, that is the must unfair pvp ability ever, why give it to a class that can heal themselves and wear mail, and has shit load of self buffs?</div></div><hr />

hahhaah I was thinking the same, it better be a badass set, for taking this long =)<br />
power of elements buahahahahahah =) I hope it has lighting on shoulders, but that don't look like tier 6, something that looks cathastrophic , maybe shoulders that look like rocks with driping lava over our arms =) and the helm driping lava over the face like a waterfall =) that would be awsome, lol helm driping lava over the face!!!<br />
<br />
I just hope is something awsome, Blizzard usually does a good job with shamans because of our power with the elements makes our sets look good =)</div></div><hr />

Currently there's two government agencies fighting for jurisdiction over MMO video games: Bureau of Publication and Department of Culture. <br />
<br />
They have been regulating the video game market cooperatively in the past. However, earlier this year, a official regulation from the central office gave the regulation right of MMO video games to Department of Culture completely. Bureau of Publication is now only in charge of MMO's initial publication. (CD, Guide, Manual etc)<br />
<br />
However, Bureau doesn't want to give up their jurisdiction, so this time when CWoW shifted from The9 to Netease, they forced Netease to resubmit application as if WoW is a NEW GAME. (If WoW isn't a new game, it won't even go through Bureau anymore. <br />
<br />
Netease submitted WoW TBC version to both Department of Culture and Bureau of Publication. Department approved of it in September, which is why Netease re-opened WoW. Bureau NEVER approved WoW TBC version, because if they did, WoW would be out of its &quot;initial publication&quot; and not under Bureau's jurisdiction anymore. <br />
<br />
Today, Bureau rejected CWoW TBC application because it considers Netease breaking the law for getting WoW back online before it even got approved. (Recall Department approved CWoW TBC, not Bureau.) <br />
<br />
Department of Culture already issued a statement saying Bureau's ruling is illegal, they will protect the operation of MMO carriers in China. <br />
<br />
This is the Final Countdown, baby :) <br />
<br />
Things are looking good on the Department of Culture side, if they come out on top, we might even see WotLK in China within a month. If Bureau of Publication somehow wins, CWoW will be likely to be suspended for a while.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirrorzoom</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Department of Culture's response:<br />
<br />
Basically sum up to this:<br />
If this is true, Bureau's ruling is illegal according to the &quot;Three Regulations&quot; earlier this year. Department of Culture is the only agency that can investigate and moderate MMO video games.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Three Regulations&quot; were passed July 2008 in order to clarify the jurisdictions of Bureau of Publication, Department of Culture and National Media Agency (Rough translation :-X) <br />
<br />
NetEase already submitted WotLK to Department of Culture and got initial response for modification. Once NetEase and Blizzard finish modifying Chinese version of WotLK, they will resubmit for approval. <br />

So your saying we cant do shit against these classes?I have never played ret, but as a holy/prot OS paladin, i feel these changes are quite offensive in PVE and PVP outside of arenas. Arenas will remain the same though.<br />
<br />
And also<br />
<br />
We have been so gentle with paladin nerfs because we’ve been so concerned with returning to lolret, that paladins as a class are still very powerful in end-game LK in both PvE and PvP. Yes, it’s not fun to be nerfed. We get that. There is very little evidence we have over-nerfed paladins at any time in the past couple of years. There is plenty of evidence that we haven’t nerfed them enough.<br />
<br />
Your evidence is all the forum QQ?Yet you purposely ignore the paladin forums because...?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A feral can't go into bear form, and they don't have barkskin right?<br />
A rogue can't vanish and eat/bandage, right?<br />
Shamans don't a have knockback or pets that stun and heal them, right? PS, one macro drops all totems brah.<br />
<br />
AND OH SHIT A PALADIN HAS A SHIT LOAD OF SELF BUFFS, I MEAN A SEAL FOR DPS, MIGHT OR KINGS (OR NOT BOTH) AND AN AURA.<br />
Yea and what would they be without those? A weaker version of a warrior who can heal.<br />
I'm sure paladins want MS - most unfair pvp ability ever (See I can make retarded assumptions too).<br />
<br />
And btw, I found your problem, you're too busy QQing instead of learning how to play the game effectively. &quot;Ah a paladin has wings or bubbles up, I'll stand right on top of him and not run away.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
so your solution to removing the defensive manner is making us even better at burst? inc forum full of QQ<br />
<br />
or are you just saying we should do average damage with no burst and still have no defensive ability and no offensive ability either? <br />
<br />
i will learn to play with any changes but the fact is all the assholes that bitch and moan on these forums wont be happy until paladins cant do anything but buffs. And of course buff there class until everyone has a lava burst type instant crit that does over 20000 dmg and then battle ground and arena will be won or lost on the soul basis of latency</div></div><hr />

You are not a cat. You don't have 9 lives. But fighting one, it seems you do. And you think you deserve that for some reason. Really makes me laugh. You think being able to heal/do damage, and live for 3 lives = fair because..warriors have MS? Yeah. 50% reduced heal =/= 3 lives, healing, and ridiculous damage.<br />

Because I mean other than that they're just as tough as warriors what with their defense against stuns, spell blocks and ability to uh... well....<br />
<br />
<br />
No I think their magic shields and healing spells are exactly their balancing against the utility other classes get. While warriors are doing their active defenses, or death knights doing their thing, ret paladins are getting beat to crap, they have to heal themselves to keep even.</div></div><hr />

You are not a cat. You don't have 9 lives. But fighting one, it seems you do. And you think you deserve that for some reason. Really makes me laugh. You think being able to heal/do damage, and live for 3 lives = fair because..warriors have MS? Yeah. 50% reduced heal =/= 3 lives, healing, and ridiculous damage.<br />

stops rogues from keeping people stunned for the entire duration of them killing us<br />
ban prot warriors from any pvp style encounter<br />
nerf larva burst<br />
stop mirror image from being used in any pvp<br />

and the list continues....STOP QQ'ing everything you cant do and learn to do it ya wimpy bitches...i read this forum to gain an insightful look into pressing matters not listen to no skill players whine that everythings too hard<br />
<br />
<br />
Firsly you are the most retarded Paladin to have posted on this forum. Stop keeping rogues from killing you for the entire Duration? Are you too stupid to trinket/Hand of Freedom or bubble? Just hand of freedom ffs. If you have problems killing rogues, you have issues.<br />
<br />
Also if you havnt realized, Mirror Image was pretty much useless pre buff, People would just aoe once/twice around the mage and bam all dead.<br />

<br />
have u ever been attacked by a rogue? they can stun u for 16 seconds...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah i have, and he sure didn't stunlock me for 16 sec, try more like 9 sec, and even if he was retarded and vanished and did CS + KS it would still only add up to like 12 sec with DR, so waaay to exaggerate about rogues, like everyone does.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly this game is balanced around 1v1 and BG's because LoH can totally be used in arena. Oh noez a paladin bubbles, not like any other class can do anything to save themselves. There no shield walls, ice blocks, vanishes, sprints, deterrence, Power Word Shields, life taps, and the list goes on. <br />
And for anyone saying stunlock rets, lol. Yea 1 minute CD on a 6 second stun you would trinket, oh my god. But rogues don't stun lock.<br />
It's not like healers can just stand and heal then /dance through a ret paladins damage. Oh wait. But it's ok, Blizz will blindside the fact of arms warriors, rogues, frost mages, warlock burst.<br />
<br />
TL;DR every class has abilities for oh shit moments, make divine shield last only say 3 seconds and have a deep holy talent to make it 6 seconds. Or remove it from ret and prot paladins and only a holy talent while giving ret an effective interrupt.<br />
<br />
<br />
So now Power Word:Shield, Vanish and Life tap equals to Bubble? Wait what? :o Cause Shield totally makes you immune to all damage for 10 sec so you can heal yourself to max, vanish works like what? 1/100 times if you are lucky that is , and life tap saves your life? more like kills you i'd say. The closest you'll get to bubble is Ice block, but then again, the mage can't really run around or evo in ice block.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your evidence is all the forum QQ?Yet you purposely ignore the paladin forums because...?<br />
<br />
<br />
Like if you asked a resto druids in TBC if they thought they were OP, they'd probably answered you &quot;we are fine, L2P&quot;. Do you honetly think you would get biased information from people playing a paladin? Like any class would admit that their that their own class in OP? If that happened then we are no longer human beings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A rogue can't vanish and eat/bandage, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah vanish works perfectly...no wait a sec? can't actually remember the last time it did work. and bandage and eat? wtf are we talking duels now? i thought we were talking arena.</div></div><hr />

Chinese servers have been operational for almost two months now, and NetEase has no intention shutting it down. <br />
<br />
Here's a player's conversation with a NetEase GM today:<br />
<br />
GM: Hello, thank you for waiting. Do you have time to discuss the issue now?<br />
Player: I heard the Bureau is gonna full rage execute WoW, is it for real?<br />
GM: We already activated Divine Shield.<br />
Player: Hopefully they don't have priest to Mass Dispel. <br />

He said Stunlock. Stunlock can be used for 9 seconds efficiently and a few more secs if you dont mind DR and wasting a vanish. Which is bad rogue play. <br />
<br />
Thats 9 seconds of stunlock. Which takes 85 energy untalented. Thats 2 Mutilates worth of damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not only have they been overnerfed - but they have been kept that way for months and months (season two in TBC) while other specs (restro druids) were not nerfed to same extent when they were dominating the arena 2v2 bracket.<br />
<br />
And not calling Sunwell a overnerf is one of the most arrogant things I have heard from GC. Not only were the fights directly affected - but gear - and abilites were nerfed - leading to holy palas standing outside instance to buff - instead of getting in. And ret at the same time ? lol - they didn't even stand outside to butt. THey were not in the game at all.</div></div><hr />

Don't nerf me bro!<br />
This is just “don’t nerf me, bro” talk. We have been so gentle with paladin nerfs because we’ve been so concerned with returning to lolret, that paladins as a class are still very powerful in end-game LK in both PvE and PvP. Yes, it’s not fun to be nerfed. We get that. There is very little evidence we have over-nerfed paladins at any time in the past couple of years. There is plenty of evidence that we haven’t nerfed them enough. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677862444-blizzards-vision.html))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TK99</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now people are admitting they didn't like the change of the status quo when Pallies were all back the bus and doing some heals and buffs but no more. Meaning never to have to compete with them for dps slots in raids (because making ret a viable dps class added yet another dps class to fight with/against) and more competition for dps plate and two handers. Not to mention now they could be taken down by experienced players, I have never heard anyone on my sever saying pallies were 'UNSTOPPABLE'! only more annoying now to kill than before, that's all. Again changing the status quo of Pally's being GG all the time to damn your annoying to kill or you got me like every other class can do with luck, skill, and gear. Speaking of gear, this was actually the biggest balance (I won't say buff since all other class scale with gear) because Pallies abilities really didn't scale with gear (at least not compared to the other classes) and it was kinda a huge over site, but it was eventually fixed (since intel plate was all we had before). <br />
<br />
Now the reasons for the nerf.<br />
<br />
1) I think Blizz cares about how medium level and low level players do in the game, this is a two way street. Meaning that medium and low level players (in terms of skill and gear) found Pallies way too hard to kill. Not that the other class's were not as hard for them, but the bubble and LoH made the QQ factor much higher to the level of almost Rouge stun lock/sap and Priest Fears. Especially since they argued there were no diminishing returns constraints on them as well. But this also meant that players thought pallies (especially ret) was easy mode and started re-rolling.<br />
<br />
2) Which brings me to my next point Blizz wants class numbers balance as much as abilities balance. Blizz has to use number of players actively playing a class to help show class imbalance. In Vanilla WoW Rouges were everywhere and they were the most OP class at the time. Druids and pallies were one of the weakest or hardest to play classes at end level and so had the fewest players rolling them. Now having come from Vanilla WoW and leaving to come back to WotLK. Anyone playing can see the number of pallies is enormous especially the BE one's on Horde, to the point it is now something like 19% (Wow Head census) of the active toons out of 10 classes. Pallies had become the other DK's in the game. The class every player had at least one and tended to play a lot of time. So Blizz based on this has come to the conclusion that in other to force players to play other classes and restore some semblance of class balance numbers. The Pally nerfs start now, more than likely they'll over do it to drive players back to the other classes and then rebuff to help undo the damage in striving for class number balance.<br />
<br />
So basically this going to be long hard road outta hell for us Pallies.<br />
<br />
First comes Sacred Shield proc-ing once ever 30 seconds, then no LoH on self and finally a 50% healing penalty (like divine plea) when Divine Shield is active. Seriously harming Pally PvE abilities but all in the name of making the class harder to play and driving players away to easier classes (at least the next most powerful in the low level players minds).</div></div><hr />

He said Stunlock. Stunlock can be used for 9 seconds efficiently and a few more secs if you dont mind DR and wasting a vanish. Which is bad rogue play. <br />
<br />
Thats 9 seconds of stunlock. Which takes 85 energy untalented. Thats 2 Mutilates worth of damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you :)<br />
<br />
And i was even being nice enough to refering all classes in general, if you're up against a priest or a paladin(which is what we are talking about here) they have 30% stun reduction so that's makes it a total of 6 sec of stun lock or 9 sec maximum. A Paladin can HoJ me for 6 sec, so yeah rogues are clearly OP when it comes to stuns and stuff....not to mention our incredible survivability and mobility in LK, oh wait i sec....</div></div><hr />

I dont want to see paladins do more damage. Met pala\restorsham in 2vs2 ( im with druid so no dispel). Seal of corruption is ridiculous. <br />
Its funny to read this crap about paladins in blue post. Defensive hybrid is defensive in pvp!! nerf! They can LoH... Lol BG's are srs business. They can bubble. What wrong with bubble? 2 classes can remove it. Rogues have CoS,evasion, warriors have shieldwall, hunters have deterrence and paladins have bubble. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Haha, last for 5 seconds, we can't attack and doesn't deflect ranged attacks. And you'r comparing this to bubble where u can full heal AND attack AND Hearthstone like little girls lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny...<br />
<br />
Ret = burst damage + bubble/LoH to survive (they're squish, face the facts, Warriors can take more dmg) + stupidly small skillset for pvp (UNLIKE other classes with &quot;1 life&quot;). Everything IS balanced around this.<br />
<br />
Blizz nerf the burst dmg. 1st spec characteristic chopped off. Nothing in return to balance that, in fact more nerfs like seal changes.<br />
<br />
Now they're removing the second spec (or class) characteristic and giving nothing in return. Now just avoid the low burst and kill it without a second tought.<br />
<br />
Funny that a supposed to be defensive class is getting chopped off it's defensive abilities without anything in return to &quot;go more offensive&quot;.<br />
<br />
LoL @ &quot;If you are up against a Ret paladin, you should be concerned with how much damage they should deal.&quot; when Blizz clearly stated that they DON'T WANT people to be concerned with the &quot;huge damage&quot; a ret should do. If they really think that, they wouldn't care to QQ about burst from a class that can only do that... burst.<br />
<br />
And it's blizzards fault that Prot Paladins are that stupid. They buffed it like there was no tomorrow. And I don't think anyone can really say that prot pallies do play on defensive... they're actually very offensive with that many buffs they gave.<br />
<br />
And they say feral druids are ok after all that? It's a problem that a Ret can &quot;tank&quot; for a few seconds (bubble is not tanking, common! don't be stupid) with that limited skillset, but it's ok for feral to go bear and tank 1,2 or even more depending on their gear level? Popping out to heal normaly, etc.?<br />
<br />
As I always said, if you brought Ret's HP down to the point of him needing to LoH (in BGs! Wich is worse since you'll probably get him with his abilities on CD most of the time!!! Bubble and LoH aren't short CDs like other classes abilities), then you'll be able to bring it that fast again without problems.<br />
<br />
Equip your brain before going PvP and you won't have problems. Remember what blizzard alread said once kids &quot;players with skill have no problem killing Rets, only undergeared and unskilled players&quot;.<br />
<br />
LoL @ only non-paladin players saying that the nerf is justified... this is the same shit as blizzard comming here and saying &quot;we're nerfing rogues skillset/damage because they're playing too offensive and should help more their friends, even if they're designed as a full offensive class&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This thing with paladins.. I dont have a paladin but i have fought so many throughout so many patches on many dif classes. My main PvPer atm is a DK and i love it, i dont generally have any trouble with any class in PvP due to their abilities as a class thats being noob, every class has the ability to kill another class and if you QQ that you cant beat something then reroll rather than getting bliz to be constantly fixing crap and making another class QQ..<br />
<br />
As for paladins i do agree with one thing. out of all the classes pallys do have high dmg output which is fine but they have too many second chances. lay on hands, bubble heal thats 2 chances from death as prot you have 3... now just estimating here but thats at least 60k hp you have to burn through and thats a ret while they are doing very powerful hits on you and thats before they get heals from their divine storm, stun and heal etc.. but at the same time i can counter this with a well placed strangulate and empower rune and nuke, but thats just me fact is they do have too much at their disposal it isnt really fair giving them that much control in PvP but at same time i dont really mind if you are skilled you can beat any class with any class, if you cant beat a class then keep practicing learn their rotation and learn how to counter it with carefully planned cc's rather than facerolling and qqing wen the rogue stunlocks you or the lolret bubbles. damn this is longer than i wanted it to be lol anyway 1 more thing.. i have to say the holy prot build does need a nerf because that is like fighting a damn raid boss.. i find myself rooting a lil too much waiting for my dstirke and rune tap cd's on that on those fights :) which doesnt get me far cause they ALWAYS have full mana xD <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xqtr</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually if equally geared and somewhat equally skilled every class cannot beat every class, it has never been that way and it will never be that way, hence that's why the game isn't balanced around 1v1. Yeah sure you have probably killed every class in BG's, but in a duel you won't beat every class, A warrior will never beat a mage in a duel unless the mage afk's to go drink coffee, he doesn't even have to use CD's to win. A rogue will never beat a feral druid unless he's got an IQ under 40(this is if both have equal gear and skill, not a 2.5k rated vs 1600 rated). There are more examples, just wanted to give the general idea.</div></div><hr />

Your statements just prove you do not know play or understand our class. Last time I checked the point of playing different classes and specs was to make the game more fun and well rounded. Im willing to bet if Blizzard came around and started calling for major nerfs to your class you would be up in arms as well, but apparently you can't see beyond your own dumbass bias.</div></div><hr />

Sunwell was challenging. That's what a lot of players are looking for in the final raid tier. If you don't like the challenge of healing a tank then I'm not sure why you'd want to be a healer. Now as I've said, we're not saying Icecrown is only for the Sunwell crowd. But I am pretty convinced there are going to be a lot of &quot;Icecrown is too hard because my tank died&quot; posts here when it goes live. <br />

I'll add it's also a problem where paladins as a whole are too defensive and not just the Protection spec ones. You see people describing fighting a Retribution paladin as a three phase boss fight. You might get them down, but then they can reset the fight with Lay on Hands. You get them down again and they bubble and heal. Compare this to an Arms warrior -- do they do great damage in PvP? Yes. Are they invulnerable? No. It's cool for paladins to care more about healing than do warriors, for I hope obvious reasons. However, if you are up against a Holy paladin, you should know that one of your greatest challenges should be dealing with their capacity to heal. If you are up against a Prot paladin, you should be concerned with their capacity to take hits. If you are up against a Ret paladin, you should be concerned with how much damage they should deal. You should not, generally, be nearly as concerend about the Prot's ability to self-heal or the Ret's ability to tank you. <br />
<br />
I said this recently, but to reiterate, for most of the other hybrids, picking a role in a fight is much more of a commitment. Sure the Arms warrior can go Defensive Stance and put on a shield, but that doesn't turn them into a Prot warrior. Nobody is super concerned about Feral druids shifting out to heal. We had big problems with DKs earlier being able to tank and deal damage with the same set of tools, but that's in a better place now. Shaman maybe the only other class besides paladins that are able to shift on the fly from dps to healing, but with their mail armor and lack of major defensive cooldowns they just don't feel as hard to kill.

Don't nerf me bro!<br />
This is just “don’t nerf me, bro” talk. We have been so gentle with paladin nerfs because we’ve been so concerned with returning to lolret, that paladins as a class are still very powerful in end-game LK in both PvE and PvP. Yes, it’s not fun to be nerfed. We get that. There is very little evidence we have over-nerfed paladins at any time in the past couple of years. There is plenty of evidence that we haven’t nerfed them enough. (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow. Could they be any more out of touch with how things really work? Claim they want ret to be about damage and not about defensive abilities, yet ret burst is at an all time low and their damage in pvp is constatly nerfed over and over. People complain about freedom, and it has been nerfed twice. Bubble damage was a base ability for years and yet it has been nerfed. Healing while bubbled has always been around. And now suddenly it is a problem. LOH is a base ability, had it forever, and now again it is a problem and is being nerfed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Genlte with ret nerfs? Are you effing kidding me? They have made ret utterly useless in pvp to anyone who has an ability to kite. Ret has never been lolret to anyone with a remote amount of skill back in the day. Gentle? Ret was nerfed before leveling to 80 even starrted. WHo gets nerfed before max level when it was designed for balance 10 levels later? Only paladins.<br />
<br />
It just boggles my mind that stuff Ret has ALWAYS been able to do are suddenly a problem when ret is at an all time low as far as viability. The only reason people feel this way is because instead of having really good rets be awesome and really bad rets be just god awful, they made it so it is impossible for good ones to do anything while allowing baddies to be decent. That is what happened, the marginalizing of the class and the difference between good rets and the bandwagon baddies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i like how he says they don't want to return to Lolret but uhm they already are laughable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you. My point excatly. I only pvp prot and have been spending lots of time getting block value gear because I can kill shit as prot much better than I could ever ret. Ret has no burst and dies way to fast despite my 1045 resil ret set.</div></div><hr />

&quot;In many ways, the Paladin is the counterpart to the Horde's shaman, but geared towards physical battle more then spellcasting prowess&quot; Thats taken from your own damn World of Warcraft manual...lol<br />
