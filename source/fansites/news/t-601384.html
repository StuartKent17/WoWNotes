<meta name="description" content="I wrote a line about it earlier, and got a lot of questions about it in mail/on IRC.  
Yes, there are Elekk and Cockatrice PvP mounts already available in the game files, nop, they're not new. They were here before the patch but they're not just used for the moment.  
 
But considering the amount of new PvP items included in the next patch, we can assume that the new mounts will be included. (Thanks to Endarion for the screenshot)
