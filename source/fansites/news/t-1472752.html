It is hard to see this on a wow fansite.. but on other gaming sites.. this is a HUGE attraction. So many ex-players out there with characters sitting at 70 or 80 are talking about coming back.<br />
<br />
but yeah, great trailer!</div></div><hr />

That trailer was made from 100% epic, not mere polygons and textures! Therefore it had no impact on game development.</div></div><hr />

Um, the trailer is titled Warlords of Draenor: Wish You Were Here. Hell, when he flies through the portal it brings up World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor. Pretty sure that's what he was flying towards.<br />

The free level 90 feature is for former players who quit the game. It's not aimed at currently active players.. although it's a nice free perk. But the whole idea is to get players to return to the game who quit at some point in the past.</div></div><hr />

If it was only aimed at former players who quit it'd be part of a Scroll of Res, not a perk of purchasing the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Scroll of Resurrection doesn't exist anymore for this very reason. It's been retired. The free level 90 is for returning players. That's not to say it's not a perk active players will enjoy.. I'm sure they will. But the perk and this advert is supposed to make players who quit the game sit up and go &quot;Ooooh..&quot; and consider buying the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It uses all the WoD stuff because the free boost is an add-in for buying WoD. The Gnome is pretty clearly in Garrosh's room in Siege of Orgrimmar at the end of the video.<br />
<br />
So technically that would mean he flew to Kalimdor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know Garrosh's Throne room is the final raid setting for SoO right? That doesn't change the fact that he was flying towards Warlords of Draenor. He flies through a portal and that's the first thing you see following it, the WoD title.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because EVERYONE knows that Blizzard planned to do a raid before WoD, and that ALL 100% of blizzard's resources were funneled into a 1 minute trailer. It definitely wasnt just 1 animator from the art/cinematics team or the machinimating intern who just made this on an off day. Because Blizz's cinematic team or interns never has a moment where there's nothing to do... <br />
<br />
Your argument is invalid buddy. Just shutup and enjoy the trailer - Thank You.<br />

<br />
6 moths since SoO, no announcement of beta in sight let alone the beta...but here's a trailer featuring the worst race in existence and a feature that is pretty much useless to anyone that's been playing for a couple of weeks 0o Next they will be releasing trailers in anticipation of other trailers that are in anticipation of WoD... -.-<br />
<br />
First of all - worst race in existence? I know it's just your opinion, but Gnomes are seen as the underdogs of WoW, so trailers/machinimas featuring them are alot more adorable, silly, whimsical, and fun. Do you really think this video would have the same effect if it was an orc, human, tauren, or even a goblin? Ew.<br />
<br />
Second of all, the feature isnt useless. Right now during MoP it's a major convenience to altoholics who want that level 90 monk, hunter, etc without spending almost a month of grinding to get him. When WoD launches, it'll help bring back veteran players, who according to other gaming sites showing off this trailer, are definitely talking about coming back soon after seeing this advertisement.<br />
<br />
Lastly, blizzard stated several times that they are making preparations for pre-purchase (as you can obviously see) and the beta. They've gave us quite a few status updates on the beta already. It's coming Soon™. You'll just have to be patient, sorry.</div></div><hr />

But I have an ever stronger feeling that the Beta might not be what we are used to, this time around. <br />
For my part, I would not be surprised if the Beta phase is going to be something very short, if we get any at all.. <br />
Over the years Blizzard has made so many improvements with the game engines and software. They can now - and do it already - integrate content and changes on live realms with barely any down time at all. Some even without having to just restart the servers. <br />
So I am prepared for a very short Beta phase. Maybe even just a closed beta for a select group to test some raid and bg stuff.</div></div><hr />

(And for my part, I'm totally in favour of the expansion giving one level 90 boost thing. It makes sense to allow new or returning players to jump right in if they so desire. The only thing I'm not too fond of is the paid 90 boost, but I can understand that it's just officializing something that people would do anyway by buying the game+expansions. Still kinda sucks, but not rage-sucks.)</div></div><hr />

On topic: I've been following the boost but not intensely (I have a 90 of every class). Does anybody know if there is an expiration date on the auto-90? I just ask because I could see some uses for it if my WoW circumstances were to change, but not in my immediate future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was discussed in another thread. Note that it's pre-purchase, not pre-order. When you pre-order you put a little down to reserve a copy. When you pre-purchase it's bought and paid for. If you take advantage of the pre-purchase you get the 90 now and you get expansion upon release. If you pre-order you reserve a copy, you can cancel at any time, and you get the 90 later.<br />
<br />
It's just one 90 either way, but pre-purchase gets it now, pre-order or buying the expansion when it's released means you get it later.</div></div><hr />

If they made it any faster it would break the game. Have you tried leveling with RAF? Zones will make even less sense. It's not even hard or take long to level any more, people need to stop complaining. <br />
<br />
They aren't making you pay more to fix a &quot;problem&quot;. There is no &quot;problem&quot;, that's a &quot;personal&quot; problem. so they are allowing those with personal problems a way to bypass that content if they wish</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explains why he is still 61 doesnt it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all he's not flying on a mount but flying through some kind of portal.<br />
<br />
Secondly, this guy doesn't go to draenor but an SoO raid.</div></div><hr />

I never get tired of Zangarmarsh or Blade's Edge while levelling, personally. I always just feel so relaxed grinding through those zones and like the aesthetics (Blade's Edge feels very vanilla-esque and Zangar always had a cool rainforest undergrowth vibe to it).</div></div><hr />

He is winning nothing. Just skips a few days of leveling. Also gets greens which you can't do jack shit with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a game with an expensive subscription as it is - don't make us pay even more to fix the problems with it.<br />
<br />
Psst. That wasn't a &quot;buy your free 90s&quot; commercial. It was a &quot;buy the new expansion and you can catch up immediately&quot; one.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Look how bored and sad he seemed. They're showcasing how horrible their game is and telling you how you can skip it and join your friends who were not dumb and lazy and managed to trudge through horrible content.</div></div><hr />

In all honestly. I do expect that the resources spent on making this ad pushed back some future raid tier.<br />
<br />
If I never heard of world of warcraft, the ad would seem to convey that the game is very boring without such a boost. Actually, even as a player thats what its saying to me. They didnt have to make it seem like not being level 90 would be boring, who would want to start playing a game that itself says that everything before level 90 would be equivalent to be walking in a desert bored and alone.</div></div><hr />

It seems to me that the fanboys are the ones who are being whiny and rage filled. I mean I've read about 5 posts where your side is flat out insulting people, kind of makes me wonder if the mods are sleeping. Yet the people being critical of blizzard and &quot;whining&quot; aren't being personally insulting.<br />

<br />
Well they already have all the models ready with controls in place, all you need to do is set the scene up, which was a desert and a mailbox. Not very hard, then you add in the random effects and such. After that you can throw it together on premiere or whatever they use, and it'l be done in no time.</div></div><hr />

They've said it what? Maybe 2/3 times where they were actually using it in response to something? Oh no! My eyes will bleed if I have to read it a fourth time! &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
It's just one of those things that Blizzard has said that the players instantly latch on to and use it wherever possible.</div></div><hr />

Don't be ridiculous. I could have done this myself in a couple of hours. I imagine someone fluent in the programs and how Blizzard's tools work would at least halve that time.</div></div><hr />
