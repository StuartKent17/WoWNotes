<br />
Patch 6.2 - Garrison Shipyards<br />
Patch 6.2 adds Naval Missions to your garrison. You can't have Naval missions without ships, so there is also a new Shipyard being added to your garrison. The Shipyard is not a building and doesn't take up any existing slots or space in the garrison. <br />
<br />
Both the Alliance and Horde shipyards are placed near your initial arrival point to the zone. The Alliance can get to the shipyard by taking the new exit (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4842-Patch-6-2-PTR-Notes-April-17-New-Monument-Blizzcon-Tickets-Saturday-Blue-Posts) that was added to their garrison. The Horde can take the existing back exit down to where the crashed ship was to get to their shipyard.<br />
<br />
The Shipyard is unlocked by completing a short quest chain at the Iron Docks, accessible to anyone with a Level 3 Garrison. Vol'jin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38567-garrison-campaign-war-council) / Varian (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38253-garrison-campaign-war-council) send you to the Iron Docks to recruit a Shipwright (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38568-we-need-a-shipwright). You collect supplies (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38570-derailment) and break Roark out (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38571-the-train-gang) of a prison train. After Roark is free, you reclaim his blueprints (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38572-hook-line-and-sink-him) and return to your garrison (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38573-nothing-remains) to construct a shipyard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38574-all-hands-on-deck). Currently it costs 5,000 garrison resource, but that is a placeholder value (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/369234-11-thousand-gariison-resources-lol/#post18).<br />
<br />
After unlocking your shipyard, you meet Solog at the dry docks (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39082-lets-get-to-work) and build a Transport ship (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39055-ship-shape). Currently the ship costs 1,000 resources to build, but this may be another placeholder value. Once you have a ship, the Assault on Tanaan Jungle can begin!<br />

Ship Models<br />
Some new ship models have been added and some are reused from previous expansions.<br />

<br />
<br />
Missions<br />
Ships have abilities that counter other abilities and traits, just like followers. Almost all of the missions are currently placeholders, but we can still get a look at the UI. A new NPC is added in your Town Hall that allows you to access Naval Missions, which require Oil (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1101-oil) to complete.<br />
<br />

Ship Equipment<br />
Ships have two equipment slots, one of which is unlocked when the ship becomes epic quality.<br />

Achievements<br />
Completing Naval Missions will unlock higher levels of the Shipyard. The benefits from the upgrades aren't currently listed, but an upgraded Shipyard may allow you to have more ships, better ships, different types of ships.<br />

Along with the other trinkets (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=19890&amp;filter-ilvl-max=699&amp;filter-slot=4096) being added in Patch 6.2, Archimonde drops some trinkets that change effects based on your spec. Keep in mind that the procs aren't final.<br />

Timewalker Dungeons<br />
1: When tuning these timewalker dungeons, are you also taking into account that they're already faceroll when you're doing them while leveling even right now? Seriously, have you tried running Arcatraz at its intended level? Bosses usually die in 10 seconds or less. I don't want that to be the kind of experience you get with timewalking.<br />
The item squish and other class changes over the years certainly have had an adverse effect on old dungeons. <br />
<br />
Our QA team is in the process of playing through the Timewalking versions and we look forward to PTR feedback as well. What we'll likely do is continue to adjust the item leveling scaling until we feel that the dungeons are appropriately tuned. We'll also be looking out for any strange outliers in mechanics and such.<br />
<br />
2: Is there any chance this feature could be expanded to raids? Most of the raids before WotLK saw very little of the player population doing them because of the number of geared players required was too high for normal people. I'm personally hoping for Ahn'qiraj and Sunwell Plateau to be brought back somehow, even if only briefly.<br />
This is still to be determined, but there are no plans for Timewalking raids in Patch 6.2. 5-player dungeons serve a significantly different purpose than do raids, and so we'd want to make sure we're not interfering with, or otherwise negatively affecting, Normal/Heroic/Mythic raid progression by adding an extra layer of &quot;legacy&quot; tiers.<br />
<br />
We definitely want to focus on getting this introduction of Timewalking with TBC/Wrath dungeons in 6.2 right first, before we consider expanding it to include additional dungeons, or especially raids.<br />
<br />
fair enough, but what happened to making new content? in the past, we would get a set of dungeons along with a new patch or raid tier: like ICC or DS. cant new dungeons be made, rather than recycling old ones? I like doing old content but it's still not bringing anything new to the table.<br />
One of my points in my original post is that this isn't an either/or scenario. Creating a Timewalking system is entirely different from creating new 5-player dungeons, particularly in terms of artist resources. <br />
<br />
We love 5-player dungeons too. But they're also difficult to introduce in patches, as they take quite a lot of time to develop relative to their lifespan as relevant content, even when compared to new raid dungeons, which require weeks or months of progression for the average guild. Most players run through 5-player dungeons a small handful of times to get whatever upgrades are available and then move on. <br />
<br />
This is, in part, why we're introducing Mythic difficulty for 5-player dungeons in Patch 6.2. Most players feel a content gap between world content and raid content once they've run through the Heroic 5-player dungeons, and we feel that a Mythic difficulty (in addition to the introduction of Timewalking dungeons) will give players more progression options in small group content further into the lifespan of an expansion. <br />
<br />
At the same time, this frees up our artists more to create the creatures and environments needed for future content, which aids us in our efforts to reduce the gaps in between content updates.<br />
<br />
Are the time walker dungeons being designed just for level 100 characters, or is the intent for the level 100 people to group with people leveling up through the content now? So e.g. Level 100s would join groups with characters level 70 for BC dungeons, etc?<br />
The intent is to group together anyone queuing for Timewalking when available. So, level-70 characters will be matched with level-100 characters for TBC Timewalking dungeons, for instance.

Blizzcon 2015 - Eventbrite Issues<br />
Message from Eventbrite<br />
On Wednesday evening, we had incredible demand for BlizzCon tickets but unfortunately, our waiting room did not work as we had expected. While thousands of people were successful in securing a Blizzcon ticket, sadly, we let others down. Our team spent the rest of the week working on a fix that we thought would remedy the issue that some encountered on Wednesday so Blizzcon’s second onsale would be seamless.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, on Saturday morning we experienced significant site slowness during BlizzCon’s second onsale. We understand what a frustrating experience this was for those purchasing tickets.<br />
<br />
At Eventbrite, we are completely committed to offering a smooth, pain-free ticketing experience for event attendees and organizers alike. This week, we were not successful in providing that experience and on behalf of all of us at Eventbrite, we’d like to apologize to the entire Blizzard community. We take issues like this very seriously, and in the coming days, our team will be looking into what caused these situations so we can remedy for future onsales.

Message from Blizzard<br />
Just want to say to everyone who ran into issues when purchasing or trying to purchase tickets: we share your frustration and are sorry that the experience did not live up to expectations.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breccia</div><div class="date">2015-04-20, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Arms spec trinket is both<br />
a) intentionally insulting, and<br />
b) horribly designed.<br />
<br />
I'll explain: as any Arms warrior knows, the big game-changer for Arms 5.0 was Sudden Death. This passive ability gave your auto-attacks a chance to reset the cooldown of Colossus Smash. This was kind of a big deal, as your remaining rotation changed pretty dramatically during the CS window, with special difference in priority between Slam and Overpower. It was removed with the new expansion, and with it, any variability of the rotation. Your CS would always be up every 20 seconds, no exceptions. This, combined with the loss of Overpower and baseline Slam, left Arms an incredibly boring spec. Because the Ability Prune was applied to every spec, even those that did not call for it. Apparently, Arms with Sudden Death was really really confusing and bad and evil and had to go.<br />
<br />
Aaaaaand look, it's back. Blizz decided that, while other spec were getting new, never-before-seen abilities or ability modifiers, Arms would get an ability we had stripped from us because of questionable game design choices. This trinket is not new. This trinket is something we had, and now we have to burn a trinket slot to get it back. That's just provocative. That's trollling.<br />
<br />
Also, it's a stupid idea. See, the reset of Colossus Smash was great in 5.4 because you were always happy to see it. Soon as the old CS wore off, BAM, you drop the new one and fill it with Hateful Death. But our spec was intentionally built to allow this.<br />
-- Rage was plentiful, and consistent. Melee auto-attacks generated the same Rage all the time.<br />
-- CS cost no rage.<br />
-- Mortal Strike generated Rage. <br />
-- If you were short on Rage, you could manually generate some before using the CS proc.<br />
-- CS added bonus damage to Slam. Since your Rage use was minimal outside CS, it was completely possible to have back-to-back CS's filled with Slams and Mortal Strikes.<br />
-- You never had to halt your rotation to apply Deep Wounds.<br />
<br />
NONE of this is true anymore.<br />
-- Rage at low ilvls is painfully slow. It is also unreliable due to Rage from auto-attacks balanced on double Rage from crits, allowing RNG to put you in a flood or a drought at any time..<br />
-- CS costs 10 Rage.<br />
-- Mortal Strike costs 20 Rage. <br />
-- There are no ways to gain Rage other than auto-attacks. And one potion per encounter, I guess.<br />
-- the CS window Arms has requires you to pool Rage, to dump as many attacks in the 6-second window as possible. If you did it correctly in the previous window, a back-to-back window is useless.<br />
-- Using Rend during CS is a DPS loss. Back-to-back CS windows are actually counter-synergistic, especially with the current tier bonuses, with Rend.<br />
<br />
The only thing that this Sudden Death Trinket gives Arms that is any way useful, is the ability to pop CS a bit faster than the 14-second downtime if you happen to get enough crits to make this a good idea. So it is, technically, an advantage. It's just a very poorly thought out one, which only fits in with the rest of Arms' design the entire expansion.</div></div><hr />

Affliction locks trinket perk is to have it's dots and period reduced? How is that beneficial lol<br />
<br />
Haste lowers the dot time, but the ticks stay constant, so a 10 tick dot over 20 seconds with 50% haste would be 10 equally powerful ticks over 10 seconds. Not sure if haste works exactly like that, but you get what i mean.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We love 5-player dungeons too. But they're also difficult to introduce in patches, as they take quite a lot of time to develop relative to their lifespan as relevant content, even when compared to new raid dungeons, which require weeks or months of progression for the average guild. Most players run through 5-player dungeons a small handful of times to get whatever upgrades are available and then move on. &quot;<br />
<br />
Makes the most sense and where I have bolded is what most people need to realize that compared to raids and some other content 5 man dungeons have a limited lifespan once a player has gained all they can from them (in terms of gear).. Really if they want people to continue running the dungeons and in turn make it worth while for them to create mid xpac dungeons then they need to have something than garrison resources as an incentive to run them ie: bring back the JP/VPs or in this case add in apexis crystals as a reward as well..</div></div><hr />

Personally. I like Garrisons. I leveled mine up. But what about those who didn't?<br />
<br />
By default everyone has L1 garrison. It trickles in resources on its own. Upgrades to the garrison itself are level related with a fixed cost. Someone could ignore all follower and buildings and still afford tye garrison upgrade tax to L2 and L3 pretty easily. At 6.2, add a shipyard to get zone access and again skip all follower and now ship missions. Your investment can be very minimal in the features. I like the features they add too, but it is accurate that they can be largely ignored.</div></div><hr />

this is slap and spit to the face of playebase - thisis blizzard basickly admiting we will never see additional dungeons during expansion ever again - huge huge dissppointemnt but exaxkly in line with changesin thise expansion - much less content for hgiher prize - f u blizz you will kill this game yourself you dont need competition to do it for you.</div></div><hr />

I have no problem that they are adding ´ships´ which are basically nothing but followers. When they announced the follower system and garrisons in general I was excited because I thought it was a neat little side game. I have played other games with timed-do-nothing systems where you send followers out for 12 hours etc. All in all, I thought it was a neat new mini-game to add similar to how I liked pet battles. The problem is, they aren´t doing anything else... the follower mini-game is actually the meat of this expansion and it is too predictable to be fun. It takes no time ( literally) with add-ons to have your teams set up to clear the important quests. Missions should have had RNG to determine the counter so at least the mini-game involved some repeated challenge.. but after the first day, it is nothing except clicking a button without thinking. 100% 100% 100%</div></div><hr />

No kidding. However, I thought garrisons were optional content. Now you have to have a level 3 garrison to see new content? I'd say that makes garrisons mandatory. Unless of course you don't want to see the new TI-style content and at that point you're probably not playing anyway.</div></div><hr />

I get that ship followers missions don't exactly set the world on fire but its difficult to complain that there's no content if you cant be bothered to even try it.<br />

On another note:<br />
From the PTR i can see at least 5 flight points on Tanaan so once the iron docks quest chain is done no one will care. 2 weeks after the patch everyone will be on Tanaan questing and raiding and the whole ship yard &quot;gating&quot; entrance thing will be long forgotten......</div></div><hr />

Have to agree though with other posters that WoW has (in this expansion at least) become a game where NPCs more or less play the game for you, have higher ilvls much earlier on than the player, and participate in open world content that was supposed to justify no flight at max level. For the life of me I simply can't understand the dev mindset that this is some sort of vast improvement than previous iterations of WoW.<br />
<br />
How, exactly, it this supposed to be more fun? <br />
<br />
How is this new design philosophy supposed to fit the MMO-RPG genre? <br />
<br />
Outside of raiding the expansion feels like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole but that's just me I guess.</div></div><hr />

For facebook type games, this type of gameplay is fun. I was excited about garrisons becuase I had enjoyed other games where it was fun to send a group into a dungeon to get loot while you were sleeping. The problem is that there isn´t much else to do with your main character... and for a subscription based MMORPG, if the highlight of your 3 hours of playtime is waiting for your followers to get back... I am not sure if implementing garrisons took more resources then they anticipated.<br />
<br />
The devs are just too comfortable and know that they can produce little content and keep players... they have the PR excuses already lined up.. It is just hard to look at a game like DDO that is old, with a small amount of players, and can still add ´art´ and gameplay features non-stop. I really don´t think the problem is with Activision, I think the problem is with the mgmt of WOW.. all this stupid stuff they keep doing like the choppers last year... yet they can´t add the same amount of content as games with 5% of their subscribers? WOW mgmt is just too comfortable, they don´t have passion anymore.</div></div><hr />

Right now it is more Garrison resources to build more ships. I built another but it wouldn't allow me to use it, because it was the same as the first. My guess is additional ships are NYI right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess I need to clarify my statement then. <br />
<br />
This is the first expansion ever that I have not felt any need to run 5 man content after my initial main toon has gone through the 5 mans. None, nada, ziltch. If it wasn't for the 4 quests to start the ring questline, my lock wouldn't have needed to to run any, and those for will be the only I ever run on him. I was LFR ready before I even dinged 100. <br />
<br />
So yes, this is the first expansion for me where I'm not bothering to run 5 mans. <br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously? So what was the brew dungeon? And jade temple? And nuizao temple? and all the others....seriously if you guys moan this much just please leave and go play another game, never seen so much whiny entitled kids on this site till today. Please leave and do us all a favour if you think things in games are trivial to make. Go make me a game right now with 50 raids 50 dungeons a world full of content and balanced pvp and i will join your cause. Oh also you have 2 weeks to do it,now go!<br />
<br />
Why should I leave? Should I not try and hold Blizzard's feet to the fire over this major lack of content at 100? And no, old content is not new content to me. I've done it all. I received my Lorewalker back in Wrath when you had to search out every last quest to get it. I'm not going back and doing it again. <br />
<br />
As for PvP. Well, we could say that there is a lack to that also this expansion. One new zone that's been busted beyond belief since WoD released. Raiding? Yup, doing that and I'm quite happy with it, but aside from raid nights, I've not got much to do. <br />
<br />
So here's a thought Skippy, why don't you leave instead of white knighting for Blizzard? People have serious concerns with the way this expansion is going, and they are 100% right in voicing them. It isn't a case of entitlement at all, it's a case for Blizzard doing as little as possible and milking us for it.</div></div><hr />

But this is the thing you and the person you quoted did only the barest of dungeons, and that you were LFR ready without the need for dungeons and that the person quoted said they would not have done any dungeons if not for the ring quest...<br />
<br />
And this is the problem that well that Blizz themselves have created, in that you can get into low level raiding via LFR without having to set foot in a dungeon.. Heck my mage was doing HM LFR way before getting into heroics, and because of this problem that they created I gather that since then they see really no point making new dungeons if you can bypass the gearing through dungeons treadmill and go straight into LFR and so on..<br />

FFXIV has new 5 mans almost every few months. Yes they are expansions of current ones, but with all new areas and bosses, so very much new. So blizz has no reason other then they don't want to spend the money as an excuse to why they won't make 5 man content regularly.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I should clarify. I don't just want new dungeons. I want a reason to do them. In wrath I ran them over and over for frost badges. Them saying they're useless is them being lazy. They could just offer us a currency for doing them. Make it daily only. And make it a long grind to get cool rewards. Like saving up enough currency to get a mount after 2 months of daily dungeons. That's how other mmos get their players to do content. Blizz must have forgot. So they're just not going to make any dungeons :/</div></div><hr />

No, Blizzard wants us to buy the new mounts, not earn them. Well, I suppose I could get some guildies and try and knock out &quot;Hero of..&quot; cheesements for those two mounts.<br />

<br />
<br />
And that's the issue. I did them on my main, mostly because in the past that's how we geared at the start of an expansion. This time, had I planned it better, my main wouldn't have had to touch one heroic while making my way to raiding. Not one. Let that sink in for a minute and you'll realize just how bad Blizzard fucked up this expansion. They made their 5 man normal and heroic obsolete before this expansion was ever released. Add in the fact that there is absolutely no reason what's so ever outside of the ring quest to ever step foot in one. At least up until this expansion we had a reason to at least run them for points to spend.</div></div><hr />

Maybe someone else can find it, I'm lazy. They were discussing how they made a mistake in mop not making new dungeons. And that they're now aware of the demand going forward.<br />

Yeah I should clarify. I don't just want new dungeons. I want a reason to do them. In wrath I ran them over and over for frost badges. Them saying they're useless is them being lazy. They could just offer us a currency for doing them. Make it daily only. And make it a long grind to get cool rewards. Like saving up enough currency to get a mount after 2 months of daily dungeons. That's how other mmos get their players to do content. Blizz must have forgot. So they're just not going to make any dungeons :/<br />
<br />
Yeah that is the problem I see as well there is no incentive to keep going into dungeons, if they added in Apexis Crystals as well as Garrison Resources then I would do them.. But since they don't I don't bother anymore as there is no point doing them.. And this is the trouble with folks wanting new dungeons once you have gotten what you want out of them, there is no incentive to keep doing them and thus wasted development time.. <br />
<br />
Back when you had badges, then points there was a reason to keep doing dungeons as there was the items you could spend those points on.. And Blizz could easily turn this all around by adding Apexis crystals to the reward at the completion of the dungeon, the only reason I can see that they did not was to stretch out the content by forcing those who needed them having to do the apexis daily.. While I would love to have new dungeons without a reward worthy of the effort put in (gear and apexis crystals or similar) and a extra reward (apexis crystals or similar) worthy of continually grinding the dungeons pretty much what we had up until the end of MoP then really the time put into developing new mid xpac dungeons is somewhat wasted if none of that is there to keep the player interested and engaged and wanting to continually do the dungeons..<br />
<br />

<br />
And that's the issue. I did them on my main, mostly because in the past that's how we geared at the start of an expansion. This time, had I planned it better, my main wouldn't have had to touch one heroic while making my way to raiding. Not one. Let that sink in for a minute and you'll realize just how bad Blizzard fucked up this expansion. They made their 5 man normal and heroic obsolete before this expansion was ever released. Add in the fact that there is absolutely no reason what's so ever outside of the ring quest to ever step foot in one. At least up until this expansion we had a reason to at least run them for points to spend.<br />
<br />
And that's the thing there is no point really in making new dungeons if Blizz are not going to put in a reason to keep doing them.. At first I thought cool that they took that sort of thing out, but seeing it in the cold light of day Blizz really screwed up big time here.. With no incentive to continually grind dungeons for a currency you can spend on items once you have gotten everything out of the dungeon there is no reason to go back.. And another thing the requirement to have PG silver to get into LFD heroics would have turned quite a few people off and pointed them towards LFR instead where the gear is better and you just have to be geared enough to meet the level requirement..<br />
<br />
But in the end really when ya look at it no amount of new dungeons will help when in the end their lifespan is so much shorter than it used to be which is a real shame..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets be honest here, they have suprised is for the past 3 expansions. Not many expected Cata, very few expected MoP, and I think its safe to assume that NO ONE expected WoD. Another left field expansion wouldnt suprise me, but im ready to get back to the main course please. I want to fight some of the big bads weve been waiting for. Azshara, old gods, Legion, Titans maybe.<br />

Funny how everyone totally forgot the most important question:<br />
<br />
Can we actualy play/manouvre the ships???? Or are they just static things on your garrison and the only use for them is to send them on garrison missions?? Because thats not cool<br />
<br />
Of course not. This is WoW we are talking about here. They haven't innovated since Vanilla. The games really starting to fall behind on a technical level. Not even talking about graphics.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, Blizz. I really hope you reconsider this one.<br />

I'm sure there will be other Trinkets you can use.</div></div><hr />

Haha, that's one of the first times I have heard anyone mention Destiny in a positive manner. Kudos.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkman94</div><div class="date">2015-04-21, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what's sad?

<br />
Yet Destiny has repetitive encounter design in story missions/strikes that all consists of horde mode and shooting enemies till they die. Hell, I'd say the raids are the only good things about the game. (Crota's End was the only good thing about the first DLC since majority of The Dark Below's content is a damn rip-off. Doesn't help that Bungie had the audacity to call it' an expansion). For a developer that was well known for excellent FPS games like Halo series, it was a huge disappointment.<br />
<br />
PvP is a unbalanced clusterfuck with a lack of interesting modes like CTF or something similar to Halo's Oddball and the absence of custom matches (What were they thinking about that?)<br />
<br />
I could say more, but that's another topic for another day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After being in development for 6years, one would HOPE they had enough content for the next year. Even though most of the content is just the exact same shit over and over.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wayne25uk</div><div class="date">2015-04-22, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I need to clarify my statement then. <br />
<br />
This is the first expansion ever that I have not felt any need to run 5 man content after my initial main toon has gone through the 5 mans. None, nada, ziltch. If it wasn't for the 4 quests to start the ring questline, my lock wouldn't have needed to to run any, and those for will be the only I ever run on him. I was LFR ready before I even dinged 100. <br />
<br />
So yes, this is the first expansion for me where I'm not bothering to run 5 mans. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why should I leave? Should I not try and hold Blizzard's feet to the fire over this major lack of content at 100? And no, old content is not new content to me. I've done it all. I received my Lorewalker back in Wrath when you had to search out every last quest to get it. I'm not going back and doing it again. <br />
<br />
As for PvP. Well, we could say that there is a lack to that also this expansion. One new zone that's been busted beyond belief since WoD released. Raiding? Yup, doing that and I'm quite happy with it, but aside from raid nights, I've not got much to do. <br />
<br />
So here's a thought Skippy, why don't you leave instead of white knighting for Blizzard? People have serious concerns with the way this expansion is going, and they are 100% right in voicing them. It isn't a case of entitlement at all, it's a case for Blizzard doing as little as possible and milking us for it.<br />
<br />
I'm not white knighting i just happen to be a games designer myself and no i won't tell you which company so you can bash it, and a majority of my family work in the business too and you know what we do with your whiny ass comments and stupid e-petitions for change on a game WE MADE? That's right we screw them up and chuck them in the bin and laugh at how sad you people are thinking your voice actually makes a difference.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? Not like you guys make 8 figures MONTHLY or anything. What a joke. Perhaps inquire as to how devs with a fraction of a percent of your revenue manage?</div></div><hr />
