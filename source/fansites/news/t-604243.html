You might want to think twice before farming in Alterac Valley while playing Guitar Hero and hitting space every few minutes. <br />
In our continued efforts to support fair gameplay in World of Warcraft and to provide a positive experience for players, we are currently taking steps to ensure fair and enjoyable competition in the Battlegrounds. Starting immediately, we will be issuing warnings and penalties, including suspensions and the removal of Honor points and recently acquired Honor rewards, for non-participation in Battleground games.<br />
<br />
We are taking action against thousands of accounts immediately, and will continue to monitor these situations and regularly take action against violators. If you encounter a player in a Battleground who is intentionally not participating in the battle for an extended period of time, please help us track the situation and report the player as AFK. For information on how to complete an in-game AFK report, please go here: (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/info.html (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/info.html)). All reports will be thoroughly investigated, and corrective action will only be taken if the violation is confirmed.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support and best of luck to you in all of your games in the Battlegrounds!<br />
<br />
Don't be too scared, it takes a LOT of reports to get someone banned and it won't happen to you just because you have to go afk every once in a while. <br />
I can assure you that if someone is going to be suspended, and have other actions taken against their account/character, that they are definitive abusers.<br />
<br />
If someone is going to the bathroom 30 times a game, 100 games in a row, they may want to cut down on the cranberry juice. (Of course, those are numbers I made up. We obviously won't be announcing thresholds, etc.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Holiday events<br />
Blizzard want to limit the amount of holiday events (otherwise we would end up with &quot;special&quot; events all the time), but will keep adding content to the existing ones. <br />
I'd like to assure you and the rest of the playerbase that we're hard at work fleshing out the existing events as well as looking into new ones.<br />
<br />
Winter Veil didn't receive much of our gentle touch this past year, but Darkmoon Faire might be a little better than you last remember. You surely know at this point of the new decks we added into the Burning Crusade, but the Exotic Goods Vendor now also stocks things that might well be of interest to our level 70 crowd. This is far from the last change we plan to make to Darkmoon Faire, and more activities and the like are on the horizon. We want to see it become more diverting as well.<br />
<br />
We plan on revisiting all the holidays, and are currently cooking up something for an older holiday that should bring a significant amount of punch into it. We're always working, my friend, and we plan to bring you a great deal of amusing things.<br />
<br />
Now, I would be moderate in your expectations. Don't expect epic items from every holiday, for example. Our aim is to provide a fun experience for players that is different from the norm for a period of time, giving each holiday its own unique feel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Europe - Ruin Battlegroup<br />
It seems that the Ruin Battlegroup is really in lack of players lately, Blizzard is trying to find a decent solution to this problem.<br />
We’d like to assure players in the Ruin Battlegroup concerned with the size of the group, and thus the activity and variety of players in Arenas and Battlegrounds, that we are currently investigating solutions to this issue. Our goal is to ensure a thriving and enjoyable PVP environment for the group, and we are considering several options to do so.<br />
<br />
We ask that you bear with us while we finalise our plans for Ruin and hope to be able to update you on our progress shortly.<br />

WoW on console isn't going to happen<br />
Or at least, not anytime soon. Yesterday a quote reported by Gameplayer (http://www.gameplayer.com.au/Home/NEWS/NEWS/tabid/1482/Default.aspx?CID=3ab06082-2c52-4d4d-ba67-167b6fb19d1c) started a rumor about WoW eventually becoming available on next-gen consoles, I got a few mails about this and it's been reported on a few sites already but if you check Gameplayer's site, you'll see that the news has been updated :<br />
<br />
&quot;A representative from Vivendi’s Australian office has been in contact with us and issued the following statement: “Regarding the statement above made by Chris Ansell at the recent Prototype event in Sydney. Chris was referring to the future of next-generation game development and how multiplayer online play was going to grow to encompass much larger groups. He was only making a link to World of Warcraft as a great example of where online play is going, not a reference to World of Warcraft on console&quot;</div></div><hr />

Recently have read a blue post saying something about Blizzard being interested not so much in penalizing afkers or the like but addressing the very reasons of afking, i.e. improving the BG itself etc. Personally i don't plan to spend even 10 second of my game time on trying to figure out who is afking on the map at any given point. If 10 people of one faction do it, statistical odds are that the same amount is doing it on the opposite side. So we play 30 vs 30 instead 40 vs 40 (big deal...). Even if that is not so that would only mean the less slacking side deserves the victory more to begin with. In short personally don't give the slightest damn about the issue - but welcome people to role play carepolice whenever and however they choose to...</div></div><hr />

It doesn'r take that long to realize someone is afk. All you do is hit m and right click on the cave. Pretty sure that doesn't take more than4 seconds, do it while you wait to res.</div></div><hr />

Haha shoo troll, go stare at your screenshots and drool over your standstill PvP and EA quality game.<br />
<br />
I've waited forever for this, thank god finally someone answered our posts, Stormstrike battlegroup is a nightmare Alliance-side, not just for stupidity, but for AFKing as well, we can't get anything done because in WSG we average 3-4 AFKers and AV upwards of 10.</div></div><hr />

I think it'll be a highly worthy alternative when it's all done and polished, but hardly a genre savior. Don't expect them to try and reinvent the wheel, it'll have plenty of pitfalls of it's own.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's battleground system on the other hand is in shambles, they've focused too hard on their one dimensional arena bit. Hopefully Lich King provides a more balanced system, because while I do like arenas, and I do very well in them, I'm personally not sticking around if cookie cutter duels with wildly unbalanced classes is the sole future for WoW.<br />
<br />
I really wish they'd restore classic AV, and do more big, epic maps akin to that style. I was expecting more campaigns, not umpteen revisions of capture the flag/king of the hill.</div></div><hr />

Anyone saw their RvR podcast? Where u can go and destroy the enemy base and receive better gear. I realy don`t understand the balance here. U dominate the enemy and u also receive better gear to dominate them even more and play with them like pupets. WHERE IS THE BALANCE?<br />
..<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena gear is exactly like this... Wow is the last game I know of that can comment upon PVP balance, either static (class balance) or dynamic (gear evolution).</div></div><hr />

U dominate the enemy and u also receive better gear to dominate them even more and play with them like pupets. WHERE IS THE BALANCE?<br />
<br />
For example Dwarfs vs Orc Area let`s say that 80% of the players will want to play with orcs, what chances does the dwarfs have ? outnumbered 4 to 1. The orcs will also receive good gear cauze the &quot;mass of players&quot; will destroy the dwarfs base and then it will become a vicious circle resulting in destroying the dwarfs base every respawn.<br />
<br />
I don`t think that they will have a system like this : <br />
- if there are 100 players chosing orcs and only 10 dwarfs u won`t be able to start as an orc there until it`s get to a 50/50 player distribution.<br />
-also not all players are hardcore playing 12h/day so it`s imposible to balance this &quot;base destroy&quot; system with high gear rewards. (If a guild of no life players join a faction, people that are online 20h/day they will dominate like hell, and soft core players will join and see this [damn our capital is over runned again]) imagine this happening in orgrimmar or ironforge that will cripple all the trade in the area.<br />
<br />
You obviously havent made any research at all.<br />
However, even though I doubt it I hope that WAR is completely different from WoW and isnt just another game that wants to ride the mainstream wave.<br />
WoW is rotting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only fanboy say WAR wont be a good game<br />
<br />
<br />
Warhammer online is probably the worst MMORPG, they have closed beta open for like 1 year and only 557.166 application ( i bet that there are tons of players with multiple applications just to get in the closed beta).<br />
<br />
almost 600k for CLOSED beta is good. WoW only had 2millions at RELEASE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crap game from crap developers. Their podcasts make me sick.<br />
<br />
Why? Me i love them. It give feedback about their game, unlike Blizzard.<br />
<br />

<br />
What is PvP for you if it is not killing opponement and destroying their base? AFK-farming?<br />
<br />
<br />
For example Dwarfs vs Orc Area let`s say that 80% of the players will want to play with orcs, what chances does the dwarfs have ? outnumbered 4 to 1. The orcs will also receive good gear cauze the &quot;mass of players&quot; will destroy the dwarfs base and then it will become a vicious circle resulting in destroying the dwarfs base every respawn.<br />
<br />
No, because the game will balance thing with NPC to even the numbers. And the amount of orc/dwarf will be pretty even, they are the 2 favorite race of Warhammer players.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don`t think that they will have a system like this : <br />
- if there are 100 players chosing orcs and only 10 dwarfs u won`t be able to start as an orc there until it`s get to a 50/50 player distribution.<br />

<br />
You clearly talk without knowing anything.<br />
<br />
If there is 100 orc and 10 dwarf, there will be 90 dwarf NPC added to even it.<br />
<br />
Yeah because there will be only 1 hardcore guild per server /rolleyes. And it doesnt matter if there is an hardcore guild vs alot of hardcore players not in the same guild. It is a whole faction vs another faction. And you get rewarded for defending/capturing a capital, so people will participate, unlike in WoW where there is no point in fighting in capital.<br />
<br />
<br />
That`s not balance that`s crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I will tell you something... QQ more, continue to fanboy Blizzard, continue to play WoW once Warhammer is out, i wont miss you once i move there.</div></div><hr />

EA is the distributor. Mythic is the developer. Should we trash WoW because it's fucking parent company is scum sucking Vivendi, who has trashed just as many, if not more developers than EA has?

Haha<br />
<br />
Ok EA =/= Vivendi, EA has done some atrocities in its time to both its employees and its customers, it is NOTORIOUS for buying out small companies who have big fan followed titles and then releasing sequels with no content whatsoever. They are also notorious for what is known as &quot;crunch time&quot;, where they force their employees to work ridiculous hours to meet a deadline no matter what the cost. They were sued in recent years over it and the employees won a large settlement. They also have a track record of focusing on graphics over gameplay, EA works on the idea that you don't matter as an employee because there are a million others who would kill for your job.<br />
<br />
Vivendi on the other hand has a fantastic track record for its employees and staff, seeing as they are up in the lists on happiest employees. They believe that happier employees means better games, and its true.<br />
<br />
Mythic is actually known as EA Mythic, its an inhouse development company, it is run and deadlined by EA, look what EA did to Hellgate by restricting its deadline to Halloween, if they would've pushed it back as planned it wouldn't have bombed like it did.<br />
<br />
Look up the research and comparisons between the two, then you'd understand why only the ones who can't see the most obvious signs of why War will bombshell are the ones who haven't done any research into the game.<br />
<br />
@the Metzen comment, I laugh, Metzen came up with an original concept for a game back in the day and pulled Orcs and Humans from Warhammer because Games Workshop wouldn't let them make an RTS for them (Oh wait Warhammer ripped its history off of Tolkien but its evolved into its own thing), Warcraft starting at 2 went way away from Games Workshop, the only thing that ever stuck was Orcs and Humans.<br />
<br />
EA will kill this game, and so will fanboy rampages by War fans who shouldn't even be flaming everyone else until they have played and understand the game. You also cannot even compare Beta applications to actual member statistics, wait until the game's release then start comparing, you guys are sounding like the Vanguard crowd from last year.<br />
<br />
So lets all just freaking stop arguing, and give it up please, theres no need to be like THIS IS BETTER THIS IS BETTER, they are both games, some people will enjoy one over the other, etc, let the flames stop, this isn't the World of Warcraft main forums where people can just spam the Waiting for WAR bullshit, this is MMOChampion.</div></div><hr />

Foul Language? Last I checked &quot;Freaking&quot; is not Foul Language outside of 3rd Grade &lt;.&lt;<br />

I'm just tired of Warhammer nerds yelling about how great their stinking game is, apparently they've never even had a chance to play the beta or they wouldn't be around here preaching about how great their game is so they don't even realize what their own game/company is like.</div></div><hr />

Yes Shadow, but it is no reason to flame the game just for it. Or disregarding the mess wow PVP has become and its negative impacts on the game. And tbh I see no significant difference between EA and Vivendi - you may be better informed - but I certainly do not consider the publisher to be a buying reason of any game.<br />
<br />
I do hope that WAR is a great game. And AOC. And WotLK. Good games is what the industry needs.<br />

Now, on topic, I kinda doubt it will change much on the AFKing side. But it has been truly awful, particularly in AV. A few days ago I was in one with 20 active players out of the 80. A friend of mine told about a AV match that had had one active player - although I don't know if it is an &quot;urban myth&quot;, thing is when people remember &quot;12 hour AV matches&quot; I doubt they are referring to this :P.</div></div><hr />

we've had matches that were 22 vs 17 or close to the 50% afk mark when you get down to it. i'll give blizzard a week to see how strictly they enforce the new afk rules. to me all this means is smarter bots, since 90% of the people who leave the caves are never reported by the general population anyway :/</div></div><hr />

Most people will engage the enemy within the first 5 minutes and they will lose any flag they may get.

there is a mod that does this, i forget the name i had it pre-2.3.2 but disabled it since. it reports everyone in certain location ranges (caves, mines, the harpy grounds, etc...) every minute for the entire duration of the game.</div></div><hr />

You may wish to look at your quote again. Anyway, point stands, you won't get rid of trolls by using all caps, insults and harsh language. Theres a saying that goes &quot;Never argue with an idiot, they will bring you down to their level and beat you with experience&quot; that fits quite adequately to the topic of responding to trolls.<br />

On the whole EA being terrible to their staff there are some horrible realities to work in the games industry. One of them is crunch times though the trend seems to at least be starting to wane slightly as people realise that programmers who haven't slept in a month don't do a lot of quality work even if you can make them sit in front of a computer for 80 hours a week. The industry is also starting to get in people who can actually plan large scale development projects a gap that was sorely obvious when projects started to grow in size, and, while EA's practice of underreporting work hours was something they deserved to get burned for a lot of the blame has to lie at the feet of the team leaders who promised games in ridiculously short development times. <br />
<br />
The contention that EA will somehow force Mythic to rush WAR out the door is also false since the Mythic guys have flat out stated that EA encouraged them to push back the release date to ensure a high quality release. While it is vitally important that Generic Sport Game 2008 be released in its appropriate calander year even EA bosses know that for a MMO it is much more important that you can gain and keep a large number of users. <br />
<br />
For those saying they report everyone in AV the problem is that you can only report 15 people within a given period of time, so you are reporting a lot of people who aren't afk and avoiding people who are, not to mention that you reduce the effectiveness of the AFK reporting system by polluting it with bad data. If you are an afker that is a good thing, if you don't afk then reporting people at random is a bad thing. If you want the AFK system to work then use it properly.</div></div><hr />

problem is in a typical 40 man AV, 5-10 are afk, so the remaining 30-35 people all have to use it properly in order for it to work. since there are plenty of people who don't want to be bothered with opening the map and right clicking a potentially moving target, or only knowing how to report the cave, etc, its up to rest of the people to actively report, and mods help us to do that without losing ability to play the game. if i watch dots on the map to say &quot;hmmm, looks like hes running in a circle time to report&quot;, or &quot;wow, that tower was recapped 3 times and his dot is still there, he must be afk and not defending&quot; then i'm wasting my own time and not playing the game, and in turn am myself semi-afk'ing in order to report them. <br />
<br />
or i am about to report someone and become engaged in combat, do i ignore the other team to report my own players? the fact is the whole afk reporting system itself was a band-aid, a half assed attempt to actually show the WoW community that blizzard thought about the problem, but obviously not hard enough. they should have been suspending and banning a long time ago, much like they did in diablo II for pindle and baal bots, or more importantly go to the root of the problem, that honor produces gear too easily, and BGs can be botted whereas pve instances generally cannot. even their band-aid on top of a band-aid in lowering the number of reports it takes to mark someone as afk backfired, since now people who defend towers are being reported, and are forced to leave their defense just to hit something so they can actually gain the bonus honor which they were defending...<br />
<br />
i would love the afk system to work, and work properly, but even at its best its nothing more than a poor fix designed to take people's minds off the real problems, and i have a feeling the latest fix of wasting man hours banning and then reading appeals on bans is going to have the same exact result.<br />
<br />
edit: grammar, and removed the pitch for rated BGs, that can go in a separate thread another time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It`s rather hard to believe in that &quot;AV with only one active player&quot;, but then again, who I am to say it couldn`t have happened. &quot;The best&quot; I witnessed myself was a game (late in the night, like 4 am) when we had around 7-8 people active on the Alliance side, and the Horde had maybe a half of it. Taking Drek down was a major pain due to natural lack of a tank and healer(-s). <br />
<br />

<br />
Lately a new &quot;trend&quot; has kicked in, yeah. Some leechers still stay inside the cave, others run out of it and quickly use their trinkets to get to the base and find a cozy spot there. It looks ridiculous everytime I happen to get back to Dun Baldar mid-game in order to defend a bunker or take back a graveyard. Usual picture being: both bunkers tagged along with the Aid Station, and around it a bunch of afk-ers, just standing. Often there is no enemy around even, just a lone rogue on a mission hiding somewhere. <br />
I usually report everyone in the cave, the base and in every suspicious spot on the map just to be on the safe side, especially during the initial minutes, and ask others to do the same. <br />
<br />
I`d like to believe enforcing the afk rules in such a way is going to help. It might, if they manage to make some people not afk in fear of consequences. But alone it`s not enough, the whole afk system should be developed further. Become more punishing if that is what it takes.</div></div><hr />
