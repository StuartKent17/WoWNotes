Based on player feedback and testing, we will be making several changes to Isle of Conquest in the next test realm build. We'd like to lay them out for you here in the hopes we're able to encourage continued participation and feedback.<br />
<br />
Increased all the gates' health from 300,000 to 600,000.<br />
Increased the reinforcement count from 200 to 400.<br />
Significantly increased the health and damage of the keep generals.<br />
<br />
Seaforium<br />
Reduced effect range of the siege damage caused. Both the player damage and the siege damage caused should be 10 yards now.<br />
The Huge Seaforium piles will now despawn for 20 seconds once looted.<br />
<br />
Glaive Thrower<br />
Reduced the cooldown of Blade Salvo from 60 seconds to 30 seconds.<br />
Reduced movement speed.<br />
<br />
Demolisher<br />
The Hurl Boulder and Ram effects no longer share a cooldown.<br />
<br />
Keep Cannons<br />
Fixed a bug that was causing them to do much more damage than intended.<br />
Keep Cannons can now be repaired once they are destroyed by clicking on them. This repair process takes 8 seconds and can be interrupted, similar to capturing a PvP objective.<br />
<br />
Siege Engine<br />
Significantly Increased health.<br />
<br />
Your testing of this new Battleground thus far has proven invaluable and we ask that you please keep the feedback coming once these changes have been applied.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as whenever some crit chicken nukes one down in WG while underneath you (and your chucklefuck allies fail to notice) a wall is effectively defenseless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should only be repaired for 50-75% of its total health, otherwise i see no point in giving to option to destroy it if its repaired 100% in 8 secs.</div></div><hr />

Glaive throwers and other drivables can be taken inside the kep to the generals room, and used against them.<br />

I have the same question. Famous people die all the time, the day before it was Farah Fawcett, now it's MJ. He didn't have anything to do with computer games, or Blizzard in particular.</div></div><hr />

1) Many of us (and I guess many of Blizzards devs) grew up to his music.<br />
2) He was the king of Pop.</div></div><hr />
