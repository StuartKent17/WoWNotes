Patch 5.3 Profession Changes<br />
There aren't many profession changes in Patch 5.3, but the major one makes leveling mining and herbalism possible in Pandaria with a low skill level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Miners can now level mining from a low skill level completely in Pandaria. Nodes will yield http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/97512.jpg Ghost Iron Nuggets (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/97512-ghost-iron-nugget) with the amount being determined by your skill level. You can combine ten nuggets to make one ore.<br />
Herbalists can now level herbalism from a low skill level completely in Pandaria. Nodes will yield a partial herb (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/trade-goods/herb?filter-patch=16758) with the amount being determined by your skill level. You can combine 10 of the partial herbs to form a complete herb.<br />
Currently on the PTR, you will sometimes get fragments and the actual herb or ore when gathering near the minimum level for that node type.<br />
The Engineering mount and pet (Skyclaw and Pierre) won't make it (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3222-Engineering-Items-Delayed-BlizzCon-Tickets-Wed-Pet-Battle-Changes-Blue-Tweets-DLC) in to Patch 5.3.<br />

Mage PvP Burst<br />
We are aware that there are many players who have issues dealing with Mage burst capabilities, however we feel that the main problem right now isn't simply Deep Freeze or Frozen orb directly, but rather the damage increase caused by Incanter's Ward. When stacked with other damage increasing effects such as procs and Frost Mage mastery, it can add up to an additional 30% damage multiplier, which can be quite devastating against many opponents. Because Incanter's Ward is one of the bigger reasons for high Mage burst, we have plans to make changes to it in patch 5.3. <br />
<br />
In an upcoming change to the patch 5.3 patch notes you will see that we are looking to change the maximum spell damage increase from 30% to 15% but have the effect duration increased to 25 seconds, up from 15 seconds. This will lower the damage coming from Frozen Orb, Frost Bomb and other skills during a Mages burst window, but that damage multiplier will just last for a bit longer. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/260468-leave-mages-alone-for-once/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7427294067?page=10#189))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
I'd love to have your opinion on the way to bring back Raid Attunements<br />
We've talked about them a lot. Like many features, we went from one extreme to another. Might be a sweet spot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331934024115318784))<br />
<br />
means 10-15 people have dropped)And it means about a hour on a single boss.<br />
I'm not sure we can deliver an epic raid experience if wiping 5-7 times is off the table. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331872482879483904))<br />
<br />
even simply boss fights are a way too long this days.<br />
How long do you think a boss fight should last? 2 min? 6? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330752734988992513))<br />
<br />
By which I mean, we were trying to &quot;fix&quot; the ICC model, but maybe it was okay in retrospect. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331936721711284224))<br />
ICC model was great, it take this long to see that equalizing 10/25 might've been a bad call or just this long to admit it? :P<br />
But we know some players liked having two lockouts and it certainly propped up 25s better. So who knows. It's complicated. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332553132846493696))<br />
<br />
Yeah, to get a drop is fun. To never get a drop isnt fun. Thats why i thought its an idea to remove RNG from looting.<br />
To get a drop *sometimes* is even more fun. It's ultimately why slot machines can be so addictive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332559186384797699))<br />
I adore the PVP model w/ Nalak. Consistent progression w/ points AND opportunity for drop. Feels productive/exciting<br />
Do you think Nalak should have been available sooner, like Anger was? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332631566863978497))<br />
<br />
Why did u opt to have the ILvl difference between LFR and normal 20 for this tier of content instead of 13 like previously???<br />
Couple reasons. Helps LFR feel less important to N raiders. Also keeps some prestige for N gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332632737808793600))<br />
<br />
Would you say all the steps taken in MOP to protect the egos of raiders has been worth the cost of alienating casual players?<br />
Worry the opposite is true. When you can see most of the content and get epics from LFR, it lessens motivations to raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332538944459767808))<br />
Historically, if your guild broke up, you'd look for a new one. Now folks can just play WoW solo using LFR. Not the same experience. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332539145266290689))<br />
Again, this doesn't mean we're going to remove LFR. It just means it shouldn't replace other content for all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332539241827532802))<br />
<br />
So far there is nothing in mop that I feel makes the loss of 5-mans a fair trade. Especially LFR which IMO is the worst<br />
We know some like dungeons. But players burn out on a couple of new dungeons in a week or two. Raids keep them engaged for months. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330754950042906624))<br />
We'd like to figure out some way to do both, but that means a dungeon that doesn't get stale after 20+ runs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330755251122622464))<br />
A raid boss might also get stale after 20 kills, but that's 20 weeks with weekly locks. Dungeons encourage faster burn out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330755434619236352))<br />
Again I am talking about trends overall. I understand players are individuals with their own desires. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330755560574156802))<br />
<br />
I think getting more skillful is a longterm investment. Getting better ilevel is a more &quot;realistic&quot; goal.<br />
Mmm. Not so sure. Noticing you're standing in a fire can be an aha moment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330486759643308032))<br />
Put another way, I can wipe on a boss 30 times and get better every time until we score a kill. That's short term skill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330486949439762432))<br />
YOU can tell players to improve skills, but the game doesn't. The game teachers players to get better gear, but not practice.<br />
How so? Standing in fire is not a gear issue. Having whole raid alive is more DPS than a few ilevels and is pretty apparent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330754393769132034))<br />
<br />
The current raid tuning is almost perfect in my opinion (started raiding in WotLK). ToT is a great raid!<br />
It is good on 25. It came out the door a little too hard on 10s. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331881476822016000))<br />
Is that really a problem trading easier organisation with harder content ?<br />
Would be different if we came out and said that 10s were intended to be very hard or very easy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332569355529371648))<br />
Are 10s largely defined by an inability to invest the amount of time that 25s do? Hence the lack of high end 10s?<br />
It could also be that there are virtually no N 25 guilds. Most 25s have heroic intentions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332631199233216513))<br />
<br />
Are 10s even balanced around having every buff?<br />
It's tough. We made the call because 10s felt like second class citizens with their lower ilevels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332553018933379072))<br />
No. Ten heroic might be a different story, but there aren't all that many 10 heroic guilds either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332553365781360640))<br />
<br />
Uld, ICC, &amp; Nax had various progression paths to complete. But ToT is strictly linear, is this the direction of future raids?<br />
Ideally we'd prefer the raid path have some choices. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331883278296567810))<br />
Yup. Strict linearity is my only issue w/ ToT layout. Raid gets tired of approaching &quot;the burnout boss&quot;.<br />
Yeah, we agree. It's nice to have a few options to switch focus from one boss to another. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331929776380067840))<br />
ICC wings were good, but creatively very bad I thought. 3 boxes off of a middle box room, where were the twists and turns?<br />
Is there a raid whose layout you thought really nailed it -- that felt like a place? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332542943103700992))<br />
<br />
Any way to keep two healing specs from zoning into same scenario? Not able to complete several runs as disc w/ atonement<br />
You should be fine for normal scenarios even with 3 healers. They aren't tuned on a razor's edge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332550047243841536))<br />
<br />
Why can we not at least do old raids on separate lockouts? No harm in 10 and 25 ICC still is there?<br />
No probably no harm. The system isn't set up to support that easily, but I don't know that it's a major design concern. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332548607007924226))<br />
<br />
Idea behind Challenge Modes is sound I give you that, but how you did it, and how it works and the rewards behind it = garbage I'm sorry<br />
Why are the rewards garbage? Because they have no player power? They are for prestige. And yes, we like them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331924896617725953))<br />

HEX: Shards of Fate - MMO TCG<br />
Cryptozoic (http://www.cryptozoic.com/), creators of the WoW TCG, recently announced a new MMO and TCG hybrid on Kickstarter (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cze/hex-mmo-trading-card-game) called HEX (http://hextcg.com/). This game is more complex than Hearthstone and has an additional MMO aspect of the game. You can see some of the gameplay here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfOfGvkdzlI).<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/lWljk92sw3U?hl=en_US&amp;amp;version=3&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/lWljk92sw3U?hl=en_US&amp;amp;version=3&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
Cards<br />
<br />
Beta will begin in late summer 2013.<br />
You start with 60 cards for free when creating your account. You can buy booster packs of 15 cards for $2.<br />
You can add gems (http://hextcg.com/socketed-cards/) to sockets in cards, allowing you to change how the card plays.<br />
You can transform cards that with their card power during the match.<br />
Cards have a &quot;double back (http://hextcg.com/double-back/)&quot; that stores achievements, which will allow you to unlock extended art. The double back also stores badges from winning tournaments and stats from your gameplay with that card. Earning experience with that card allows you to unlock the foil version of the card.<br />
There are five different types of cards:<br />
<br />
Action - Cards are used to cast buffs, attack, or defend against other actions. Basic actions are only usable during your turn, quick actions are usable at any time, and once an action is over the card goes to the graveyard. <br />
Constant - Cards are the same as Action cards, but have effects that stay in play, preventing them from going to the graveyard. <br />
Artifact - Cards that are artificially created objects, such as robot troops or a cauldron. <br />
Troop - Cards that can attack, block, or defend, and stay in play until it is destroyed. <br />
Resource - Cards that grant resource points, a threshold, and a charge point. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
<br />
You can form a guild with friends and save decks into a guild bank for other members to practice against. <br />
Your guild can also participate in guild tournaments and PvE raids.<br />
Dungeons are a solo experience, allowing you to lose three battles before having to restart. The more of a dungeon you explore and defeat, the higher your momentum, and the greater your reward at the end.<br />
Raids involve three players fighting against a strong enemy.<br />
The choices you make while playing through dungeons and raids will change the story, making it a unique experience. <br />
You can trade cards and equipment with other players, or sell it in the auction house.<br />
In PvE, your champion will level through gaining experience. This will make your champion stronger and change the art on the card. Every 10 levels you will earn a talent point, allowing you to choose from one of three talents.<br />
Equipment is only used in the PvE campaign, and is used to improve the card it is attached to. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Champions<br />
<br />
Each champion has six equipment slots, allowing you to place up to three pieces of equipment on one card, or spread them out on different cards. Some cards have set bonuses.<br />
There are 20 champions to choose from in PvP and each has a champion power, similar to the Hero Power in Hearthstone. <br />
There are six classes to choose from: Cleric, Ranger, Warlock, Mage, Rogue, and Warrior.<br />
There are two factions and eight races to choose from for your character.<br />
<br />
Ardent - Humans (http://hextcg.com/story/humans/), Elves (http://hextcg.com/story/elves/), Coyotle (http://hextcg.com/story/coyotle/), and Orcs (http://hextcg.com/story/orcs/).<br />
Underworld - Necrotic (http://hextcg.com/story/necrotic/), Dwarves (http://hextcg.com/story/dwarves/), Shin'hare (http://hextcg.com/story/shinhare/), and Vennen (http://hextcg.com/story/vennen/).<br />

Low level economy? What about what it'll do to the current economy? This will increase the number of people farming current ore/herbs while decreasing the number of ore/herbs available at the same time since the return is 1/10th-ish due to the nugget conversion rate.</div></div><hr />

Then you can start by giving engineers a whole heap of gear to make. Enough to make up for the past three expansions having nothing but helmets and handful of guns. I'd love to be able to craft myself a full suit of engineering armor with cogwheel sockets. <br />

No enchanting should remain expensive or time consuming to level simply because the sha crystals are going from 300g to 50g if everyone is an enchanter..it would ruin the economy the enchants would drop massive in prices aswell.<br />
If you want to level it quickly the easiest way it to take 15k gold and level it 1-600 im matter of hours.<br />
But they could make it like 1-600 to take 100x sha crystals for example that would be quite fair to level up then.<br />

If you finished you'd realise that the jokes were all making fun of what people stoop to doing in order to make money; selling drugs, auctioning your body off for a tattoo, being a hit-man, selling an organ, prostitution, etc. He's making fun of himself because a number of people see Kickstarter videos as begging (which is silly).<br />

The point was that he would do anything to get this game funded because he loves it so much. He sold his kidney, was a hitman, and acted like a prostitute to get money to fund his project. Also the tattoo on his hands is his phone number that you can actually call and he will most likely answer. A number of people on the Hex forums called the number and its legit. Pretty cool if you ask me. But i can see how the stuff in the background might be a bit distracting.

<br />
a.) players who level primarily through dungeons<br />

Either that or inflate those prices to hell mode.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to add more incentive for old world materials; Not remove it. <br />
More vanity items and &quot;toys&quot; from old world materials would be a better solution. Not this crap.<br />
<br />
And to the people complaining about respawn rates in Outlands/Northrend;<br />
I farm there all the time while I'm bored. I have no idea what the hell you people are talking about and I'm just going to assume you're using google to grab a &quot;path&quot; to follow; Which everybody and their dog does. If you expect to find things tracing the same route most people do you're doing it wrong.<br />
I can walk out with stacks in about a half-hour or so of just flying around at complete random. Took me around that amount of time to walk out with both herbalism and mining ready for Northrend. <br />

No probably no harm. The system isn't set up to support that easily, but I don't know that it's a major design concern. <br />
<br />
They'd better not implement this...simply because some bosses are impossible to solo in 25, and a switch to 10 is needed to clear them in order to attempt (or farm for transmog etc.) the ones after that are soloable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you leveled a character/profession since Cata? Most of the time- especially with LW- you outlevel the zone way before you get enough mats to &quot;outlevel&quot; the profession. It's actually a concern.<br />
<br />
Though it would make a lot more sense for them to go back and lower the mat cost of the professions to be more inline with the leveling experience. That way, it would encourage more people to actually take up professions while they are leveling- instead of waiting til they are maxed out to do so.</div></div><hr />

not sure if troll or not....<br />
<br />
but uhh, Obama took office in January 2009, kick starter was founded in april 2009. So yes, a crowdsourceing model for investment founded after Obama took office would grow in popularity during that time period, but I think your applying too much causation with the correlation. This is primarily startups or small companies looking for investment to get going or grow by sourceing from a large number of people for small ammounts rather than going to a relativly few ammount of investors with large ammounts of cash who may other wise not give them the time of day due to the risk. for instance, alot of interesting game ideas that would never get tried by large companies because they are not proven, are getting funding through kick starter. Its a new model that fills a need in the market by organizeing many small investors in a cheap manor in a way that is much easier to get exposer than traditional models.</div></div><hr />

It is very simple if you actually think about it. People that raid do not want to run all over the map to level a profession to help them with raiding. The people that love to make money and will go out and herb will be the ones making a killing off this new change.<br />
<br />
People want the fast track and both mining and herbing give a decent small bonus to damage. Faster players can level this the more happy they will be. This is called catering to the raiders. That is why the change is being put in. If everyone agrees or not, it is the saying &quot;You can not make everyone happy so cater to the biggest group&quot; I am not for or against this change but it is not hard to figure out why the change is coming.</div></div><hr />

No, it's exactly like the cooking, blacksmithing changes where people were crying how it will destroy the economy, especially for the bs change, and now everyone of those is quiet. Why should a max level character be forced to level 1 zone to train his profession, that was dumb back in 2005 and is dumb today, and you should be able to level everything in the environment that is currently right for you i.e max level zones.</div></div><hr />

Is wow trying to put off new players? or is this a way to try to mitigate CRZ, by making it less attractive for hihg levels ot be in the old world zones?<br />
<br />
Why the hell do low level players need to farm gold to begin with? Unless you're making twinks (which you should have a high level alt to help you buy/farm anyway) just freaking level. There's nothing that's so expensive that the quest gold won't cover it. Make your gold when you hit 90. <br />
<br />
And if you're dungeon grinding, that's even less gold you need to spend. CRZ has been pretty terrible as far as I've seen, there's always high level players flying around the zone snatching up nodes that lowbies are slowly making/fighting their ways to. This is meant to mitigate the high level presence in these zones.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freia</div><div class="date">2013-05-14, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is very simple if you actually think about it. People that raid do not want to run all over the map to level a profession to help them with raiding. The people that love to make money and will go out and herb will be the ones making a killing off this new change.<br />
<br />
People want the fast track and both mining and herbing give a decent small bonus to damage. Faster players can level this the more happy they will be. This is called catering to the raiders. That is why the change is being put in. If everyone agrees or not, it is the saying &quot;You can not make everyone happy so cater to the biggest group&quot; I am not for or against this change but it is not hard to figure out why the change is coming.<br />
<br />
Mining itself gives absolutely no bonus to damage. Using the mats to level an associated crafting profession is where you would get the damage bonus. Min-Max raiders would not have mining on their raiding main at all.</div></div><hr />

It will make the price of herbs more worth while for the people that actually want to take the time and make money. If you are lazy you then pay the price. If you take the time to mine your own herbs you save money but if you do not then you will pay the price.<br />
<br />
It is the people that &quot;farm&quot; that make the money. I can not wait because this will open up the market for people that want to do the work and make them rich of of the lazy people!<br />
At the moment you may be right, but I trust all crafting professions will follow the power level revamp soon enough and this will devalue low level mats massively. The only thing this will open up is either people being able to level professions with the toons they are leveling, or max level characters powerleveling professions with max level mats.<br />
<br />
Either way, no one is going to buy that low level crap anymore, unless it involves transmoggable gear and what not.</div></div><hr />

IMO, it's difficult to keep up with herbalism or mining on an alt. If you do a few dungeons or BGs while leveling, you're already too high of a level to mine/herb in an appropriate zone, at least with BoAs/RAF/+300% xp elixir, etc. You then have to stop leveling and go back to lowbie zones to raise those skills, which isn't very fun. An herb converter for alchemy like inscription has would be great, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've leveled 7 characters to 90, 3 of which were from 1. Leveled Engineering, Blacksmithing, Enchanting, Jewelcrafting, Herbalismx2 Miningx2 and Alchemy since the start of MOP, nevermind cataclysm. <br />
<br />
People need to stop being lazy and blizzard need to stop giving in and making things easier and convenient for everybody. Damn game these days has next to no immersion and you need to be able to X Y and Z within a day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that Blizzard doesn't make content with the idea that people will eventually solo it. This is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Play Game. Solo content means nothing in an MMORPG. If this is the direction people want Blizzard to go, then there needs to be a WoW solo player game for those people.</div></div><hr />

It's just a supplementary system, it's not gonna remove the old way of leveling professions. Sure the people with loads of gold/time can still use solely the new system.</div></div><hr />

Cryptozoic (http://www.cryptozoic.com/), creators of the WoW TCG, recently announced a new MMO and TCG hybrid on Kickstarter (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cze/hex-mmo-trading-card-game) called HEX (http://hextcg.com/). This game is more complex than Hearthstone and has an additional MMO aspect of the game. You can see some of the gameplay here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfOfGvkdzlI).<br />
<br />
<br />
That sounds familiar...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cards<br />
<br />
Beta will begin in late summer 2013.<br />
You start with 60 cards for free when creating your account. You can buy booster packs of 15 cards for $2.<br />
You can add gems (http://hextcg.com/socketed-cards/) to sockets in cards, allowing you to change how the card plays.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh! I read about that (http://www.penny-arcade.com/2013/05/10) (and saw it (http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2013/05/10)) on Penny Arcade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Truth is, they wont ever tone down a mage to what they always do to warriors, so you're safe.<br />
You must have me mistaken for someone else. I don't PVP unless forced to for PVE reasons (Long Strange Trip, etc) or I get talked into it by my guild mates and I am drunk. I think PVP should be removed from the game because all it does is ruin it.<br />

<br />
Yes how dare someone want pvp to be balanced as well as pve.<br />
<br />
Oh btw, it's not a nerf in pve because even though they cut the damage bonus on incanter's ward in half, they increased the duration of the buff by 40%. So your damage will be roughly the same. Maybe slightly less overall, but honestly nobody cares if you do 1k less dps. Bosses will still die.<br />
<br />
Also, I can't believe people are saying that MoP caters to the hardcore and not the casual. LFR itself is pure casual. Just like GC said, if you wanted to, you could play solo and see all the content. People just want Normal to be stupid easy so they can get through it like they get through LFR and get the Normal mode gear and feel good about themselves.</div></div><hr />

Spent some time looking into human attention spans, and all I can find are a bunch of uncited claims (ranging from 8 to 20 mins) plus a single study at http://bit.ly/eCmPuM (which is hard to compare because it's about chemistry lectures). Still, I wonder what would happen if those big drop-offs (4.5 mins, 7 mins, and 9 mins) were target lengths for LFR, normal, and raid fights...God knows I never want to do a fight as long and dull as Sha again.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing saying you can't level your prof as you level, just the same as you always could. This is just giving an option to prof leveling for <br />
<br />
a.) players who level primarily through dungeons<br />
b.) players who change professions at high levels<br />
c.) anyone who would rather just level to max as quickly as possible without bothering leveling their profession on the way<br />
d.) insert your reason here<br />
<br />
<br />
you missed the point, I never ever said anything about not being able to level profs.<br />
<br />
I said there will not be a market for low level mats now, so lowbies or re-rolls may find it hard to get money together, used to be low level herbs sold for a mint.<br />

<br />
Gold for flying? and such? the speed you level now lack fo money is a serious concern for new players. Try it, you'll not have close to the gold you need at the right levels if you just &quot;freaking level&quot;.<br />
<br />
You missed the point entirely.</div></div><hr />
