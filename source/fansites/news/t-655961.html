We thanks millions of Chinese wow players for your support. Nothing is impossible when we are together! We also thank Taiwan wow players for your tolerance and understanding. Hope we can share our honors with you.<br />
<br />
Too bad that wowprogress.com will miss the world No.1 guild (points-wise only, we respect Ensidia and thank Meka for those courteous comments) for days or even weeks. Hopefully there won't be another one-week-delay for the next patch so we can compete with best guilds in the world on every boss rather than those hardest ones only.<br />
<br />
We are the Stars! (Source (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=72355.0))<br />

Official Patch Notes Update<br />
The official notes have been updated to reflect the changes in this build.<br />
PvP<br />
Lake Wintergrasp<br />
Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed.<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
Dungeon and Raid ID Extensions<br />
In order to allow for parties and raids to progress through instances at their own pace, players can now extend a dungeon or raid ID on an individual basis.<br />
Existing or recently expired IDs can be extended via the Social tab under Raid by clicking on Raid Info.<br />
The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended. Doing so will extend the lockout period by the same amount of time as the original lockout (i.e. extending an Ulduar raid ID will add 7 days, a Heroic: Halls of Lightning dungeon ID will add 24 hours, and a Zul'Gurub raid ID will add 3 days to the lockout time).<br />
An ID can be extended more than once.<br />
An extension can be reversed on an individual basis provided the player does not do anything in the instance during the extended lockout period that would save that player to the instance.<br />
<br />
Items: General<br />
Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.<br />
Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.<br />
Parry Rating: The amount of parry rating required per percentage of parry has been reduced by 8%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still diminishes more quickly than dodge.<br />

Enrage: This Bear Form ability now generates 20 rage initially, and 10 rage over the next 10 seconds. The armor penalty is unchanged.<br />
King of the Jungle: This talent now reduces the mana cost of Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form by 20/40/60%.<br />
Primal Tenacity: This talent no longer reduces the mana cost of Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Pets<br />
Roar of Sacrifice: Redesigned. This ability can now be used on any friendly target to make that target immune to critical strikes, but the hunter pet takes 20% of all damage taken by that friendly target. Cooldown is now 1 minute, up from 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=670) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br />
Frost<br />
Empowered Frostbolt: Instead of increasing critical strike chance by 2/4%, this talent now reduces the cast time of Frostbolt by 0.1/0.2 seconds.<br />
Permafrost: In addition to its existing effects, this talent now also causes the mage's Chill effects to reduce healing received by the victim by 7/13/20%.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Protection<br />
Ardent Defender: Redesigned. Any damage that takes the paladin below 35% health is reduced. This reduction applies only to the portion that pushes the paladin below 35% health (example: a paladin at 50% health takes a 40% hit; the first 15% hits as normal while the next 25% is reduced). In addition, once every 2 minutes an attack that would have killed the paladin will fail to kill, and instead heal the paladin for up to 10/20/30% of maximum health depending on the paladin's defense rating (example: a paladin with defense equal to only 5 times his or her level will receive no healing from the talent, while a paladin who is immune to critical strikes from boss creatures through defense will receive the maximum amount).<br />
Guarded by the Light: This talent will no longer cause Divine Plea's duration to be refreshed by using Judgement of Wisdom, Judgement of Justice, or Judgement of Light.<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
Art of War: Now only applies to melee critical hits, but will make your next Flash of Light or Exorcism instant. In addition, this talent now provides notification in the floating combat text when it activates.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=640) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?priest))<br />
Psychic Horror: This spell no longer has an invisible missile, so there is no travel time before the spell takes effect.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
Dispersion: Cooldown reduced to 2 minutes, down from 3 minutes.<br />
Improved Mind Blast: Redesigned. Now, in addition to reducing the cooldown of your Mind Blast spell by .5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds, while in Shadowform your Mind Blast also has a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to reduce all healing done to the target by 20% for 10 seconds.<br />
Vampiric Touch: The amount of damage done when this spell is dispelled has been doubled.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=660) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
Chain Heal: Jump distance increased by 25% to 12.5 yards. In addition, the amount of healing now decreases by 40% as it jumps to each new target, instead of 50%.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Shadowflame: The angle of the cone effect on this ability was inadvertently very small, making it difficult to use. Its cone is now the same size as similar spells, such as Cone of Cold.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Bloodrage: This ability now generates 20 rage initially, and 10 rage over the next 10 seconds. The health cost is unchanged.<br />
Execute: This ability now never costs more than a total of 30 rage. The tooltip for Sudden Death has been revised to remove reference to that maximum, since the ability now behaves that way even when untalented.<br />
Shield Block: Shield Slam no longer benefits from the increased block value granted by this ability. However, while Shield Block is active, Shield Slam generates 100% additional threat.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Engineering<br />
Added a new Mind Amplification Dish attachment for helmets, allowing engineers to control other humanoid targets. Some restrictions apply: does not work in Arenas, dish sometimes reverses targets, unable to stack with other stat-improving head enchantments and makes your helmet look... stylish? This attachment provides a passive bonus of 45 stamina.<br />
Gnomish Engineers and Goblin Engineers can now switch profession specializations for a fee.<br />
The Spynocular belt attachment has been changed to a Frag Belt. The Frag Belt periodically produces a Cobalt Frag Bomb that can be used from the belt every 6 minutes (never runs out!).<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Mage Tier-7 2-Piece Bonus: Now grants 25% additional mana from mana gems, down from 40%<br />
<br />

I hope it will somehow tune down the whole &quot;Chinese players are bad&quot; crap, which is most likely due to Chinese players on US/EU servers often being gold farmers, but certainly means nothing about &quot;real&quot; Chinese players.<br />
<br />
And indeed, synchronous patches would make competition for world-first much more entertaining in China, where you obviously only compete for region-first kills on most bosses. Good luck if that was to ever happen.<br />

Second off for the &quot;whatz dis warriorz stuff&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll explain.<br />
<br />
Random noob gets feared, warrior executes random noob.<br />
PRE-PATCH - Random noob had a chance on damage to break from his fear.<br />
POST-PATCH - Random noob automatically breaks from fear.<br />

<br />
* Execute now removes and grants immunity to Fear, Sap, and Incapacitate effects and generating extra rage for when taking damage for 10 seconds. <br />
<br />
That's probably supposed to be Berserker Rage and not Execute.<br />
<br />
* Ghost Wolf now also regenerates 1% of your maximum health every 5 sec.<br />
* Corpse Explosion now has an additional effect - Any targets killed by your Corpse Explosion damage within 10 yds will also explode. Triggered explosions can only occur once every 6 sec.<br />
<br />
Both of those are Glyph effects currently, are you sure the abilities are changed?<br />
<br />
* Savage Roar is now only usable in Cat Form.<br />

It currently only removes fears, not incapacitate and sap effects. EDIT: Oops I'm dumb, it does remove those already. I think Boubouille just misread something then, as it seems extremely random (and unneeded) to add those effects to execute.<br />
<br />
<br />

The video better be of better quality than the photo. Hope no one tries to pull filming P1/P2 as 0 keepers and sub in another attempts P3 that used only certain keepers. Key points best be shown!<br />
The hard point of 0-keeper Yogg is not having Thorim so the adds in that phase can't die, you'd be able to tell the difference pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

But I still doubt you'll get another 10% for 540+ defence, instead of defence scaling the heal inbetween something 1-20%.<br />

<br />
<br />
look at Dk's Icebound Fort<br />
20% for non tanks, ~40% for tanks<br />

<br />
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire - Defeat Archavon the Stone Watcher, Emalon the Storm Watcher, and Koralon the Flame Watcher within 60 seconds of each other.<br />
<br />
I wonder how it's even possible. only by dividing the group by 3, but it would still be hard to kill emalon and his overcharged adds or the enrage timer on algalon<br />
<br />
the possible strategy I think would be:<br />
<br />
everyone moves to archavon and bring him to ~10%. then a tank, an dps that can offtank and a healer stay with arch, while the rest moves up to koralon. they bring him to ~10% and a tank and a healer stay there, and the rest move up to kill emalon. after he's dead, the emalon group divides in 2 and 1 go to arch and 1 go to koralon to finish them off in 60s<br />
<br />
they problem I see is archavon charges targeting ppl in other room, if it's possible</div></div><hr />

<br />
How the hell does anyone do the 10 man ones? Don't the bosses evade if dragged out of their room?<br />
<br />
So, I guess you'd need 5 tanks and 4 healers and 1 dps or something silly. 2 tanks for Archavon (bring him down to 5%) and a healer for them. One tank and healer for Koralon (bring him down slowly). Then once they're both low, get Emalon and kill him the normal way sometime, the finish the others off.<br />
<br />
That can't be right. Has anyone got a clue as to how to even attempt this? I don't know how hard Koralon is but I've heard he's just a patchwerk with a 'don't stand in the fire' mechanic. <br />
<br />

TBH when 3-4 of their raid groups all manage to kill yoggy with 1 or 0 watchers up the same week(with both the +3, +2, +1, achievment earned this week so they didn't do it +3 one week then +2 another week but all att the same time) I tend to get a bit suspicious.<br />
But we'll know for sure in a couple of days.<br />

Their DPS is pretty mind-numbing. The adds in +0 will overcome you long before you ever hit the enrage timer, so if you've can't outpace it by a mile, then you're in trouble. It looks like they may have had 4 healers and one off-healer that was doing some DPS, to boot, instead of 5 healers.</div></div><hr />

There's fear, BoP. And the insanely high dps on yogg (everyone's on him because they do not dps the immortals). There's a very very short time in phase 3 before the tanks get overwhelmed just by a scant few immortals.</div></div><hr />

Triggered explosions can only occur once every 6 sec.<br />
<br />
* Glyph of Corpse Explosion - Increases the radius of effect on Corpse Explosion by 5 yards.<br />
<br />
If this built-in effect doesn't replicate the current &quot;2 corpse explosions&quot; glyph, I estimate that 4 of the 5 DK's in the world who use this talent will spec out of it! (Yes, I actually use it, but considering its a trash-only talent, I'm ashamed to admit it)<br />
<br />
It really just needs a flat damage boost this patch, considering how situational it is, and the fact that you're skipping a new and improved Death Coil to use it.<br />
<br />
I also think the 1 second difference in cooldown between Corpse Explosion and it's secondary effect is kind of weird... I would rather have them both at 6 or 5 seconds, but I doubt I'll be using it fast enough for it to matter.</div></div><hr />

Check News post again. The stats are +10 to all and matches any socket. So it's a prismatic. Btw that theory's flawed, as of 3.2, the Dragon's Eye will have a single color depending on what it is cut into.<br />

<br />
Can you do that? I was pretty sure u can only hit the brain for a couple of seconds max before the brain becomes untargettable. I know you can dot it though and that works, but still. That is an idea, I might try that. If that was the case, you could Bloodlust your melee at that point, and as u said, go crazy.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I think you may be onto something there, I Actually bothered to count the # of adds in which they had up and By the time they killed the boss they had a grand total of 9 or maybe 10. Now, Taking into account the fact that an add spawns Instantly when phase 3 starts, and another add spawns every 10 seconds. Phase 3 lasted a grand total of 80-90 seconds for them.<br />

<br />
This happened to us once, but it was just an artifact of server lag. We managed to DPS the brain to ~18% before it &quot;despawned&quot; and we were asking ourselves. &quot;Why don't we always do this?&quot; Then the server crashed.<br />
<br />
When we tried again on the next attempt, the brain successfully despawned at 29%, and always does.</div></div><hr />

There's a video of the last bit now. And they're not a guild that &quot;no one has heard of before&quot;, they're the same people who downed Illidan in T3 gear something like 57 days after their country got TBC. That's why they moved to a TW server from CN, by the way. TW gets patches a week late, not months late, if at all.<br />
<br />
If world firsts were determined based on time since patch, Stars would have almost every world first in existence. That's why I think it's kinda funny that EU world firsts are adjusted by one day to account for their later patches, but not Eastern firsts. I'm happy to see an Eastern guild get the props they deserve. I'm curious to see what Ensidia has to say about it THIS time. Lulz.</div></div><hr />

The 20% Mortal Strike debuff was given to Frost Mages and Shadow Priests because they had absolutely no way of performing continuous DPS in an Arena match against a healer. For those two classes, it was all about surviving and coordinating Snares and CCs. For a Frost Mage, a Shatter Combo doesn't come often, and it takes much more skill to pull off successfully than a Facerolling Retribution Paladin. And no, Freeze -&gt; Frostbolt / IceLance doesn't mean you're good at Shatter Combos. <br />
<br />
Frost Mages and Shadow Priests don't charge in, spend half a minute slamming every global cooldown they have while their face turns red and they bleed all over their keyboard, only to pause ever so slightly for a dispel or bubble -&gt; heal. We actually think before casting something, we don't have instinctive &quot;I AM SLOWED! TARGET NOT DEAD! SO BOF!&quot; buttons. They take finesse. Shadow Priests were under-represented. Here's to hoping for more buffs to Shadow Priests.</div></div><hr />

Stars is actually the best guild in wow and every raider heard of it. They always get in top 5 world kills, but because of the fact that they get the patches 1-2weeks later than the rest of us, they're chances on getting world 1sts are very slim.<br />

That's why I think it's kinda funny that EU world firsts are adjusted by one day to account for their later patches, but not Eastern firsts. I'm happy to see an Eastern guild get the props they deserve. I'm curious to see what Ensidia has to say about it THIS time. Lulz.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well it would be quite unfair to adjust simply by &quot;time since patch&quot;. Obviously, a guild that starts an encounter with the same gear and in-game context as another but one month later has the insane advantage of knowing the decently well through countless guides, user comments and videos all over the web.<br />
<br />
Not saying that PTRs and such don't provide info at all, and I admit I'm not totally up to date and what I say might not be accurate in wotlk, but I guess everyone agrees that for sunwell fights, say the eredar twins (not a trivial boss but not a boss on which the world first kills have come late after the boss was available), there's been some delay between the very first kills and the release of guides and such. During this delay, the competition can be fair the time to kill the boss since the patch date is considered. Even a bit after that, if a guild kills the boss after many good guides are available, but had obviously already put a lot of effort in making up tactics before these guides were made, it's still ok. It's not the case if you get the patch after already learning as much as you can of the tactics.<br />
<br />
That of course doesn't apply to relatively straight forward encounters, but to encounters in which building an efficient strategy is a big part of the time spent for world first kills, whether or not mastering this strategy is difficult.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there is clearly no discussion this time (assuming that the sad EU/US posters are wrong and that the kill is legit): Stars pwned on this encounter :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I do wonder, how did they beat it with over 4 min left till enrage, if some of the other top guilds in the world say it's mathematically impossible to do it using the total available time, up to the last second before enrage?<br />
<br />
There's three possibilities:<br />
<br />
1) They have insanely mad DPS, a lot more then any of the theorycrafting considered possible (not likely, but possible)<br />
<br />
2) They discovered some new tactic (very unlikely, top guilds have been on this fight for quite some time, I don't believe that stars would figure out something that so many others haven't)<br />
<br />
3) They hacked or exploited something (not unlikely, having exodus still in the back of my mind)<br />
<br />
I really hope it's either one of the first two. If it is, GRATZ to STARS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I do wonder, how did they beat it with over 4 min left till enrage, if some of the other top guilds in the world say it's mathematically impossible to do it using the total available time, up to the last second before enrage?<br />
<br />
There's three possibilities:<br />
<br />
1) They have insanely mad DPS, a lot more then any of the theorycrafting considered possible (not likely, but possible)<br />
<br />
2) They discovered some new tactic (very unlikely, top guilds have been on this fight for quite some time, I don't believe that stars would figure out something that so many others haven't)<br />
<br />
3) They hacked or exploited something (not unlikely, having exodus still in the back of my mind)<br />
<br />
I really hope it's either one of the first two. If it is, GRATZ to STARS.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem was never the hard enrage timer.<br />
<br />
The problem was somehow handling all the immortals without being able to kill any of them, and figuring out a good enough tactic to stall them long enough for the DPS to burn the crap out of yogg before the tanks got pasted by a swarm of immortals being healed by shadow beacon.<br />
<br />
From what i have heard and seen, they literally had to pull out every stop. Army of the dead holding off immortals, rogues having second threat and sprintkiting and evasion tanking, i think even BoP's were used to keep kiting people alive. Then there was the massive amount of taunting and kiting needed to prevent shadow beacons from going off in the horde and rebuffing all the immortals. And of course to hit dps required, people had to dps THROUGH the lunatic gaze, which meant that P2 had to be shut down freaking fast, probably within two portal phases, in order to preserve max sanity. In fact, you can see afflict locks chaining drain soul on yogg all the way in the video.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was just going to ask, how the hell did they manage to have that few adds (remember the exodus video? the whole map was insanely flooded with immortals!), but now I see it: just get a ton of warlocks &gt;_&lt;. And the enrage times fits. That's insane and gratz, ofc.<br />
Can't say it's balanced, though. &quot;Just bring along an insane amount of dps&quot; doesn't sound like a nice tactic for me =(<br />
<br />
<br />
Exodus's exploit left them unable to pull guardians away from yogg, leading to him being healed a crapload throughout the fight by beaconed immortals, hence extending the time of the kill by a long margin.<br />
<br />
And as i have said above, there is a lot more to P3 than &quot;Just bring along an insane amount of dps.&quot; Said insane amount of dps still is required (heck, what hard mode does NOT require insane dps?) But tank kiting has to be flawless, as if a shadow beacon goes off in the wrong spot, the main immortal tank gets instagibbed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most of the dps comes from aoe and multiple target spells in p3, from what I can tell<br />
<br />
and just a little bit more, I heard they arguing about 10 warlocks make it relatively easy a while ago on Chinese forums.<br />
<br />
definitely not kiting, we will see when video comes out.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks can dps through the gaze with drain soul since the target only needs to be in front during the initial cast, the rest of the channel they can turn and be faced away from yogg. This is partly why they use warlocks. Another reason is that warlocks are great at dpsing multiple targets, which helps in this fight in particular because you still need to have some dps on guardians.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the yogg+0 strategy.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
some abstract:<br />
<br />
1 mage (there only for p2 outside decurse)<br />
SP/rogue(major AOEer to suppress Shadow beacon HOt healing, and AOE down IG)<br />
warlock(major dps on yogg, drain soul can get as high as 16k-18k per tick)<br />
2 hunter and 3 tanks (the most tactical persons, that when beacon comes sperate them and then get them together for AOE)(3-5 beacons)<br />
<br />
1 disc priest and 2 pally for 1 tank each , and healing druid for mobile healing.<br />
timewise, there is only 3 beacons for you to down the yogg, otherwise you will get overwhelmed<br />
for beacon, when it comes, the move of hunter/tanks are crucial, and any mistake is wipe (there are randomness, that IG with beacon may be clamped to one tank, which is wipe)<br />
<br />
everyone dps must have the ability to do 5.5k-7.5k dps even you have 1/3 of time not facing boss.<br />
<br />
because drain soul and no need to face yogg and good aoe, the more warlock , the better, 10 warlocks make it very trivial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
everyone moves to archavon and bring him to ~10%. then a tank, an dps that can offtank and a healer stay with arch, while the rest moves up to koralon. they bring him to ~10% and a tank and a healer stay there, and the rest move up to kill emalon. after he's dead, the emalon group divides in 2 and 1 go to arch and 1 go to koralon to finish them off in 60s<br />
<br />
they problem I see is archavon charges targeting ppl in other room, if it's possible<br />

stupid question (never was in the vault) can the bosses be kited out of their room? i would suggest pull them toghether and nuke em down.<br />
otherwise they must be soon downable by 3 man each in 10 man mode. maybe only with full (best) t9 or even t10. one tank, one heal, one dps in every room..and you even have one spot left.<br />
but it may be a fun achievment for ptr like the black knight one (is this still on?) or maybe we underestimate 3.2 by far :)</div></div><hr />

They have said repeatedly that they want you to &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now this is obviously limited to some extent, but having to use 10 warlocks, just to get a kill, seems way overkill.<br />
<br />
People who will say &quot;once they get better gear it will cut down on stacking&quot;, well news flash, Ulduar has been out for over a month, a lot of players in world first guilds have almost BiS gear, and know how to play their class to the best of their ability. If this is what it takes to kill the hardmode, it's about time Blizzard takes a look at the encounter and tune it better.<br />
<br />

Definately good job to Stars, this kill is well deserved and shows what can be done with some determination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first time yogg use Beacon, the tank go to a,b,c,this three point<br />

to ensure the Guardian wouldn't increase the HP, keep the tanker in safe<br />

the second beacon arrive,after 90s, there would be 10 guardian, each tanker would have 3 guaedian(one of the tanker would have 4). tanker go to A B C,these point as the first time,and then, at the green point(graph),the hunter would use Distracting Shot, distribute into 5 point averagely.<br />

Any World top raider wil tell you horde have the raiding advantage.<br />

<br />
Side note: its sad because they probably wont get world firsts in Coliseum since they get the patch 1 week+ later than europe so Ensidia will most likely steal the world firsts.. it just won't feel like world firsts from Ensidia anymore tho because you just know for a fact Stars can hold their own even if they are 1 week+ behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its always been like that though, the only difference is, alot of people now know they get the patch 1 week later instead of not alot of people knowing. There isnt anything different :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frexxia</div><div class="date">2009-07-08, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering that they obviously stacked the raid, isn't that going against Blizzards design philosophy? They have said repeatedly that they want you to &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now this is obviously limited to some extent, but having to use 10 warlocks, just to get a kill, seems way overkill.<br />
<br />
People who will say &quot;once they get better gear it will cut down on stacking&quot;, well news flash, Ulduar has been out for over a month, a lot of players in world first guilds have almost BiS gear, and know how to play their class to the best of their ability. If this is what it takes to kill the hardmode, it's about time Blizzard takes a look at the encounter and tune it better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Definately good job to Stars, this kill is well deserved and shows what can be done with some determination.<br />
<br />
They didn't use 10 warlocks, they only used 5 (Still stacking to some extent though).</div></div><hr />

This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.<br />
* Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.<br />
* Parry Rating: The amount of parry rating required per percentage of parry has been reduced by 8%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still diminishes more quickly than dodge.<br />
<br />
So... this means we'll lose a fair chunk of dodge and gain a little parry. Kay. =(<br />
Might hurt, but my warrior tank had 29% dodge unbuffed and something like 17% parry, so I guess it sort of makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You might want to educate yourself then. The racials are of very little significance. <br />
<br />
You point to the fact that Horde tanks will have more health? Which Cows? That amount of health isn't anything compared to Night Elf's racial when talking about tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention not everyone min/maxes their race to their class. There are probably zero examples where an entire raid has all players using the best race/class combos.<br />
<br />
No, you aren't bashing, but you are making yourself look stupid. Any advantage is so insignificant it truly doesn't matter. I also highly doubt all those 1% Alliance wipes would be dead with a Horde set up, as per my previous statement that most people (including high end raiders) do no min/max to the race/class degree.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gratz to Stars. Wish you guys could get the patch same day as US/EU, but hey, Ensidia wouldn't be the top guild and they can't have that can they? Can't wait to see Ensidia's remarks! EXPLOIT EXPLOIT BECUASE WE DIDN'T GET IT FIRST!!!!!!!<br />

<br />
irony! ;)<br />
<br />
I agree with most of the rest of your post though. The racials aren't AS big a factor as they used to be. Tauren health was changed to more base health...but at the same time once you get down to the 1-2% wipe stage...even small tiny little factors over the course of an entire fight COULD have made the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesn't it already do that?<br />
<br />
<br />
My understanding from earlier posts is yes it does, but this is more of a tool-tip clarification than an actual change...but I don't play a warrior so my apologies if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering about those Warlocks in the video being able to cast DS without getting smashed by Yogg in p3, but now I know how it was possible. I wouldn't put a LoS hotfix out of the realm of possibility of that in the future.<br />
<br />
On a side note, it was funny reading some of the people's strategies for defeating the 3 Watchers as if they were to be fought in Vault... when it appears to clearly be a Coliseum fight. :P<br />

<br />
<br />
Racials do make a big difference.<br />
<br />
Most decent top end raiders DO pick their raiding character based on race/class racials in exaclty the same way they reroll their professions to get the best possible combination of stats.<br />
<br />
Top end guilds min / max in this way as much as they can.<br />
<br />
When the patch comes that allows you to cross faction, you will see many high end alliance raiders go horde because of this.<br />
<br />
edit - and the extra stam that cows get is a better racial than the night elf passive 2% avoidance for most of the hard mode encounters for ulduar<br />
<br />
Stam is better on slow big hits (like unbalanced strike, fusion punch, mimirons magic tic in p1 etc), whereas the avoidance is better on multiple small hits (aoe tanking, and perhaps algalon).</div></div><hr />
