Warcraft Movie - TV Spot<br />
Another TV spot has been released! This one has a character we haven't seen before. <br />

Legion - Unwrapping Pets<br />
In Legion, pets from promotions, the Battle.Net shop, and the TCG are unwrappable. <br />

Legion - Action Camera<br />
Legion added a new camera feature with that changes the camera to focus on your target rather than always being centered on the player. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nameplates - Set nameplates to the normal position or under the character<br />
Head Movement - Heavy, normal, low, and no head movement<br />
Target Focus - Focus the camera on your target or the player.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Legion Beta - NPC Phasing<br />
As many have confirmed, this isn't localized to Dalaran (although there's likely many different ways this is breaking, it's not so much a single global issue).<br />
<br />
We're continuing to work on this today; as our engineers find things to improve, they push out code changes, and either restart the servers completely (like with a 15 minute countdown to restart) or just instantly crash and restart all the instance of Dalaran running (which is more instant).<br />
<br />
This is our #1 issue on the Beta at the moment - we know it's impacting your ability to test the game in virtually all other avenues. Thanks for being patient while we work through it.<br />

Legion World Quests<br />
Level 1 and 2 WANTED quests have been tuned down significantly, please give them another shot and let us know what you think.<br />
<br />
Level 3 WANTED quests (currently) retain their high level of difficulty, blue icon, and extra-high chance to drop good loot.

Blue Tweets<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
Are proving grounds still going to be a requirement in Legion?<br />
No. The emergence of Mythic dungeons, requiring premade groups, removes the need. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/727574452418936832))<br />
Just to clarify, you won't need/have Proving grounds to queue for Heroic dungeons in #Legion ?<br />
Correct. Proving Grounds still exist, but PG Silver wonâ€™t gate Heroic dungeons. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/727629756095586304))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Thoughts on Blizzards response to legacy servers? Did you expect it? Would you find any interest in pristine servers? Thanks!<br />
Good on JAB for saying something publicly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725022310474739712))<br />
<br />
Tell me honestly, do Blizz really not have the code for old versions of WoW? Odd for a software company to not have backups.<br />
I'm sure they do, but I don't think the idea of data security is that you restore to a 10 year old version. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319282985291776))<br />
I mean think about how much things like OS and server hardware has changed in 10 years. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319401910624256))<br />
Could they make it work? Probably. Would it be an extraordinary effort? Probably. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725319510954102784))<br />
<br />
One of the hardest lessons in Game Design is knowing when it's appropriate to not give the player what they want.<br />
So long as you can empathize with why they want it and not come across as if you know better than them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/725844381790396416))<br />
Man the hilarity of you guys' tweets really never gets old. You have no clue what players want at all.<br />
Players almost never want the same thing. That's what makes this job both hard and fun. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/726097986535591936))<br />

They gender bent Alodi in the novel. She says almost the exact same thing she does in the movie in the novelization, having now seen the preview passage.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I thought I remembered it was for mounts as well, but didn't have any to demo / didn't want to post that without confirming again. I should have posted it forever ago, along with the actioncam but I didn't think people would be super excited so just never bumped it up my list enough.</div></div><hr />

Son as in &quot;young man that I kinda care about&quot;, not as in &quot;actual biological son&quot;.<br />

Do we know if that is the same Alodi though? For all we know, it's just another person named Alodi.<br />

It's the same, just as a woman instead for some reason.<br />

I can actually see this potentially being decent for pvp. Would need to see it in action more, but I think it might be pretty solid from a pvp perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree it looks a little odd, and I don't know if I'd enjoy it for late heroic / early mythic raiding, raid achievements, etc.<br />
<br />
Still, it might be a way to freshen up the game a bit for my army of alts, and Legion beta just started, so I'm sure they'll play with it a bit more. It's a pretty substantial change, so any one fix could really modify how it works.</div></div><hr />

A pool of known-good that are tradable for a short time period? Are there 'whammy' pets in there?<br />
Promotional pets are gained through unwrapping (previously they were sent via mail)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've reported these as visual bugs, but given how long other similar visual bugs have remained I'm not hopeful.</div></div><hr />

There are pets that you earn thru achievements either in WoW or in other games. Up until now, any time you create a new character on your account, these pets would be waiting for you in your mail once you create the character. This created a few small problems, like being unable to delete a character you just created simply because you haven't cleared out your mail on your brand new toon. Now, instead of receiving them in the mail, they're in your pet interface waiting to be unwrapped. Does that clear up the unwrapping thing a bit?</div></div><hr />

Seriously, all that this advertising has done is make Warcraft look like a cliche filled, generic fantasy. The 4 scenes posted the other day, the one with the 2 orcs talking did more for the film than any of these trailers or TV spots have done, and the brilliant NBC Universal is claiming copyright infringement everywhere on the one thing that could have turned into true viral marketing, they quashed.<br />
<br />
I am sorry, but Warcraft the movie, based on the trailers, looks terrible. It might actually be quite good, but you would never know it from this tv spot.<br />
<br />
Agreed 100%. If the movie is good (or at least enjoyable) yet fails to bring an audience, marketing are to blame 10000000000%. I don't know who is leading their marketing team but they need to be fired. Here in Australia I have yet to see any ways of promotion on TV or in the theatres (anything the general public would see). Maybe I've just missed something but it's as if the movie doesn't exist here! Looking up the movie on our theatres website it appears to e releasing June 16th here.</div></div><hr />

Would need to see it in action more, but I think it might be pretty solid from a pvp perspective.<br />
<br />
Are you sure locking the camera to follow a target wont mess with your spatial/raid/general/environment awareness? Especially in pvp or raids? Its good for people who cant get through silver proving ground and never want to to play better than clicking the same 3 ability dps rotation. It looks cool but its console controller garbage. When the games gets to the point when you have total 8 spells, it will be a good addition to the xbox and ps version. Right now its just a step towards it.</div></div><hr />

Lothar has a son in the film who you see in this tv spot. &quot;Son, you're all I have, I would march in hell for you.&quot;</div></div><hr />
