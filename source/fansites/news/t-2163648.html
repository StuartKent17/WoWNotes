They have used exploits in the past, so it's only natural that people mention it. Far from pathetic, but simply going by the guilds history in raiding. <br />
Huge grats to them if they did it fair, personally hope they didn't use any exploit and that the kill was well deserved. <br />

Equipping bullshit items when you log out is something many top tier raiders do. Paragon did it as well when they killed Ragnaros HC for example.</div></div><hr />

Exploiting a previous raids boss, doesn't have any effect on the current raid. Unless there was an exploit here, where so far there has been no proof of such thing.</div></div><hr />

How does that logic relate to any other competitive activities? If you cheat the stock market you go to jail and are not allowed to use the market again. If you cheat in anyway in a sport you are banned for a long period or for life. Why would this be any different?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because this is a video game. And the creators and those in charge, make the final say.<br />
<br />
If you're in a real life football game, and cheat, you get banned and can no longer play.<br />
If you're in a wow raid, and cheat, you get a short term ban and then are allowed back in to play as usual with no future drawbacks. <br />
<br />
Those in charge, those who make the rules, SHOCKINGLY, make the rules. Blizzard dictates that they can continue raiding and competing, therefore, they're allowed to continue. <br />
<br />
Unlike how in real life, where you AREN'T allowed to continue.<br />
<br />
Honestly your argument makes no sense at all.<br />

<br />
Hell even in sports, if a player cheated and got banned for 5years, any game he won after that would still count as a win. Because he did the time those with real say, decided was enough.</div></div><hr />

Some of their ppl are streaming now and they said they did encounter a few exploits but didnt use them and wiped everytime they thought they'd get any unfair advantage since it wasnt worthed to exploit. So i guess its a legit kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're in a real life football game, and cheat, you get banned and can no longer play.<br />
If you're in a wow raid, and cheat, you get a short term ban and then are allowed back in to play as usual with no future drawbacks. <br />
<br />
Those in charge, those who make the rules, SHOCKINGLY, make the rules. Blizzard dictates that they can continue raiding and competing, therefore, they're allowed to continue. <br />
<br />
Unlike how in real life, where you AREN'T allowed to continue.<br />
<br />
Honestly your argument makes no sense at all.<br />

Hell even in sports, if a player cheated and got banned for 5years, any game he won after that would still count as a win. Because he did the time those with real say, decided was enough.<br />

every patch they deliver raids that can be cheatable somehow, and the top raid guilds instead of just competing, they are<br />
beta testers, i mean you work and pay for the game at the same time... ironic.<br />
<br />
These raiders are reponsable of finding bugs and cheats, of content that is the main reason alot of people play this game.<br />
<br />
So, blizzard just let the players find this bugs for them... and still you re paying. It's like buying a burger every week and<br />

At the end of the day, it's a game people take interest in. In YOUR opinion the fact that those who exploit aren't perma banned makes the entire thing a joke, in my opinion as long as they lose the raid they cheated in, then idgaf after that.</div></div><hr />

Far as I'm concerned, exploiters really should get perma banned with no second chances anyways. So as far as I'm concerned, any guild that killed a boss is still above them.</div></div><hr />

Luckily you're in the minority with this opinion which is a really good thing because if this was the case, there wouldn't be a world first race.<br />

Paragon used to specifically say that once world first was won, they slowed down on progress because there was no reason to go super hardcore for 2nd place. Interesting to see whether Serenity/Method will take the same approach now that there's so much animosity there.</div></div><hr />

What the heck is &quot;out of no where&quot;? If you didn't know anything about them before doesn't mean they're nonames or something, ESPECIALLY if we're talking about guild of different langauge/culture/internet segment from you. <br />
I have a lot of friends in their ranks which I was playing with in vanilla&gt;wotlk and trust me they work their asses off for the stuff like this. Certainly no less than other top guilds thats for sure. Being at the top of the food chain in Russian WoW also helps a lot too.<br />

Subtract the ones which have members advertising paid boosts on streams (that should be a perma-bannable offense) and there's not many left.<br />

they didnt come out of nowhere, theyve been a pretty consistant top 5-10 guild for like 10 years now, with paragon out of the game and method split between method and serenity, not hard to see how theyve been doing so much better this expac.</div></div><hr />

They won't I guess but seriously method before the Helya WF they weren't as hardcore anymore, and thats my guess even now.

The method brand is no longer carried by just progress in raiding, they still get exposure being second/third whatever. This is ALL serenity has and they made a big stink about breaking off from method too, its kind of funny if you think about it.<br />

Serenity is probably getting pissy, method is probably just glad the grind is over for a bit (the hard grind anyway, until 7.2 releases).</div></div><hr />

If you ban the top 200 players in the world, a new top 200 players emerge. So I'm not sure that argument really works. If banning the top 200 shows the games are serious about fair clean competition, that's even better PR.</div></div><hr />

thats unfortunately where the analogy with real sports starts to break down. in real life sports the rules are clear up front 99% of the time, in software unexpected or unforseen things happen all the time.<br />
<br />
in real sports you aren't going to run into a soccer field where standing in the corner suddenly teleports the goal in front of you for example, but in software such a thing could happen (and has happened in live servers, dark simulacrum in sinestra for example). So in software you have to judge post-fact a lot more often whether something was within the rules or not, and there is more grey area that one might think since it's more about intent then actual exploiting.<br />
<br />
In such a situation if you just perma ban everybody all the time it's just going to stifle the scene. At some point the hardcore will stop buying new accounts, and then you reach the people who care about their accounts and don't want em banned, who will just stop playing and ask blizzard whats up every time something happens that isn't in the dungeon journal (fun fact: mythic guldan last phase isnt there). and then there isn't a race to speak off anymore.<br />
<br />
a simple example: spell reflect ignores all damage of dark slash in maw of souls, which is unusual since the general rule of thumb is that spell reflect does not work on boss abilities. if blizzard decides it was a bug and fixes it, should i then be banned for exploiting the bug?</div></div><hr />

Well, I get what you are saying and I don't know that I totally disagree.

At least they're honest idiots. Fusion posted the video about them exploiting encounter almost instantly after they've done it while spamming forums about it.<br />
<br />
well i was also calling it fishy because they were banned for exploiting on helya, and lost the world second kill for doing it<br />
and well now it seems to be people have caught them for doing something <br />

It's baffling to see people saying Exorsus exploited Helya. Read their statement and if you have at least some neural activity in your brain you will understand it was a combination of strategic decision making and flimsy blizzard coding.<br />
<br />
Anyone who says exploiting is real is a cretin, it's clever use of game mechanics. There is no bug abuse, there are bad coders. They are the ones who should be punished, not the players who compete for world first. Congratulations to Exorsus. A well deserved victory again.<br />
<br />
except they did, they purposly broke the fight, and knew about it, weather it was fixed or not, it was still known to be not part of the fight</div></div><hr />

killing yourself to avoid a mechanic is one thing<br />

sure. but if it happened in a 5 man dungeon it would just never be fixed and just deemed as &quot;the way things are now&quot; because by that point too many people had seen/used it.<br />

sorry but they cheated their way to Helya mythic and they got punished for it. In my home country they say &quot;its better if your eye pops rather than your name&quot; translating to sort of &quot;its better if you lose and eye than getting named for something&quot;. In this case Exorsus has caused the naming thing by getting caught and banned for cheating.</div></div><hr />

people commit suicide to avoid boss abilities all the time. the exploit wasnt that, it was that it prevented it form happening indefinitely. <br />

I agree, I prefer hot fixing myself. I also wonder if X number of attempts per week is also the better option. The US hasn't had a world first team in years (or ever?) so in some regards, maybe it's OK to let us beta test it all. Not sure that would catch all the issues.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure reflecting boss abilities isn't a bug because there are multiple abilities that can be reflected. And reflecting a Dark Slash doesn't stop him from casting dark slash again, it's a big difference.</div></div><hr />

well when a group who has never got world first before gets world first xavius, then is banned for exploiting well trying to get world second helya, and has now gotten world first guldan (after not getting world first on any other of the fights in the raid) people are feeling confused and concerned there might be something fishy going on</div></div><hr />

no, cheaters should be banned, but blizz cant ban hundreds of thousands of players for weeks for doing something when tons do it (short term yes, like 1 day bans, but week long bans) would kill.....<br />

they exploited and got banned on helya so people are abit skeptical... no one can blame them for that... calling people pathetic for thinking people who have exploited and been banned, may not do it again...<br />
<br />
yes people whine and cry about top guilds account sharing ALLL the time, but people have given up on blizz enforcing it, as really it is not a super important rule... its more of opinion then actual hard facts of &quot;this gave them a massive advantage&quot;<br />
<br />
and again, sterotypes are created for a reason, they arnt allways accurate, but we literally JUST HAD a russian guild banned for 8 days because they exploited on star auger, and exorsus had been banned for exploiting on mythic helya....<br />
<br />
and really? your the &quot;pathetic&quot; one<br />
a group who has never had a world first, suddenly gets world first, is then caught for exploiting, and gets in 3 raids, 2/3 world firsts and when they exploited they couldent even get world first of helya...<br />
<br />
people have the right to be skeptical... calling them pathetic for it is not really fair...</div></div><hr />

Spell reflect reflecting an ability is not something you will be banned for no. But intentionally exploiting a bug that removes an ability completely from the fight will.<br />
What happened on Helya was that they killed their tank when she used an ability on him and that made it so she would never use that ability again. Killing your tank to avoid an ability until you don't have any brezzes is a valid strat, but not when you only need to kill the tank once and then the ability will never appear again.</div></div><hr />

You are basically repeating my point.<br />
I never talked about &quot;the exploit&quot; or &quot;preventing from ever happening&quot;. I was just drawing a line between using a game mechanic and using a bug, and was suiciding to fuck up the boss from using the ability again, is clearly a bug, and is considered an exploit.<br />

no. <br />
<br />
the same action can be ruled differently, exploit of clever use, based on the circumstances. there is nothing clear, obvious or objective about it. <br />
<br />
the only general statement you can make is that if something is discovered and used during the world first race, it's more likely to be deemed an exploit. and if something is discovered and used later, it is more likely to be simply classified as a bug and fixed, or classified as clever use of mechanics and left as is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was simply saying &quot;what has all of a sudden allowed exorsus to out of no where push ahead? have they really kicked up their game? has method got lazy? or is something fishy going on because we all know russians love to fuck about... you know after the week long ban to the russian guild who exploited star auger&quot;<br />
<br />
Well Blood Legion and Paragon died, and method split into two guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/119631451 start of stream, he doesnt have DMC buff.<br />
<br />
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/119631451?t=9m15s 9minutes later he shows his gear, and he has DMC equipped.<br />
<br />
http://i.imgur.com/fqdV8U5.png screenshot of the logs from Exrosus gm, showing druid wearing the trinket.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/119631451?t=1h12m49s This is where the bug actually happens, he runs past NH entrance guards with the trinket equipped and gets the buff from entering combat , then he zones into NH and keeps the buff even outside of combat. Later on he switches trinkets and still keeps the buff.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: he got the buff hours after the kill, he actually wore the trinket for the kill. The bug seems to have been accidental and only happened later on.</div></div><hr />

There was a massive post from I believe Method on the front page of this very website who said they have done it and will continue to do it because if bans aren't given out then not exploiting the boss puts them too far behind to catch up.<br />
I'll never really understand it but Americans seem really salty the cold war never escalated. Russia is not the source of all evil.<br />
<br />
What the fuck is this post even? Do you even understand the post you quoted? If people were permabanned for exploits there'd be a lot fewer players competing for the top spots, at the very least in Blizzard's minds. The world first race keeps some people playing, so they don't want to risk shutting it down too much.</div></div><hr />

You guys? I see you associate an entire demographic with a handful of shit posters on the MMO champion forums.<br />
<br />
LAWL.. world first race in WoW. More exciting watching paint dry. Because you know.. at least you actually get to... see it? <br />
<br />
Hard to get excited refreshing some website that comes across like an excel spreadsheet and call it a race. I am happy the Russians won though. Good to see it isn't just the same old drama mongers over and over again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Far as I'm concerned, exploiters really should get perma banned with no second chances anyways. So as far as I'm concerned, any guild that killed a boss is still above them.<br />
<br />
your same logic should apply to swedes/danes/poles aswell because they all have past history of exploiting. Espiecally in WoW. If exploiters got perma-banned not a single one of the guilds in the top 3 would be there. Hell, probably not even top ten. Everyone exploits, the scale, severity, and whether or not they are caught is the only variable.</div></div><hr />

They had already gotten a World First, they were World First on Emerald Nightmare, that place had a short race but it was a race nonetheless and Exorsseus demolish the raid in 10 hours.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, however this is more of a big deal since it's the final boss of this tier having them win T19 overall, which was more what I was referring too.</div></div><hr />

Yes thats the thing Daan. After the kill - Raiders swap gear, talents and even specs. Just to confuse the competetion.<br />
The stuff you log out with after the kill - is what you see on wowprogress. So you can never belive the first kills.</div></div><hr />
