Lion's Pride and Horde's Might Fireworks<br />
What’s more satisfying than vanquishing a worthy foe in honorable hand-to-hand combat? Planting an explosive in their freshly felled corpse, that’s what! Light up the sky above a recently defeated enemy player with these reusable fireworks and send an unmistakable signal to the other faction.<br />

<br />
Fill the sky with faction pride<br />
These fireworks given you an explosive new way to declare your allegiance when you encounter other players, whether it’s on Battlegrounds, in the Arena , or out in the world . Simply plant the fireworks on the corpse of an opposite-faction player, stand back, and watch the sky.<br />
<br />
Variety pack<br />
Once your firework ignites, it will randomly explode in one of several faction-themed patterns. “Ooh!” at the Lion of Stormwind. “Aww!” at the emblem of the Horde. “Oww!” at the blade of your mighty axe.<br />
<br />
Everyone gets one!<br />
The toy will be yours immediately after completing your purchase. Both factions’ fireworks are included, and you can reuse them as many times as you wish. Once activated, the toy will be applied to all current and future World of Warcraft characters in the same region on a single Blizzard account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Transmorpher Beacon<br />
Play Like a Boss!<br />
The ethereals have a twisted new trick up their sleeves, and they’re ready to traverse the nether to help you spread some chaos and confusion on the battlefield. Use this beacon to summon an Ethereal Transmorpher who can turn you and your allies into some of the most fearsome foes Azeroth has ever known.<br />
<br />
For a limited time, 25% of the proceeds will contribute to the year’s final LAN event prize pools for the Arena World Championship (AWC) and the Mythic Dungeon International (MDI).<br />

<br />
Walk in Blackhand’s boots<br />
The Ethereal Transmorpher will temporarily change your appearance into one of dozens of random epic foes you’ve faced over your adventures. Will fate grant you the form of Grand Magistrix Elisande, or the shape of shadow-twisted Ner’zhul?<br />
<br />
Your own legion of evil<br />
Once summoned, the Ethereal Transmorpher is willing to alter the shape of everyone in your party or raid group, should they so choose. Form a group of friends and turn the tables on your foes in your next dungeon run.<br />
<br />
Everyone gets one<br />
The Transmorpher Beacon will be yours immediately after completing your purchase. Once activated, the toy will be granted to all current and future World of Warcraft characters in the same region on a single Blizzard account.<br />
<br />
<br />
As both Arena and MDI grow, we want to give fans a chance to further support the programs—and have some fun along the way! Soon we will introduce two new in-game toys to our shop (details to follow). A portion of the sale of these toys will contribute to the prize pools for both WoW esports programs.<br />
<br />
These toys will go on sale in the spring. As the proceeds will contribute to the year’s final LAN event prize pools for AWC and MDI, those prize pools will be announced later this year.</div></div><hr />

Why? Because a company is putting up ways to fund prizes or their business practices? Guess every Girl Scout selling cookies, every run of popcorn from the Scouts, and every school that sells snacks are just money hungry cash grabs, right.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The company is already funded through a variety of different sources (and isn't exactly short on money). $10 for a single toy is vastly overpriced.</div></div><hr />

Sure, when you dont pay every month for the said scouts ? <br />
Btw, waiting for the effects of these one ; if it's a slighty better version of flag toy it can be okay, like a black market flag of victory for cash. For the transmog guy, if it offer real special/unique transmo, i will be REALLY disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Eh. Who? Might have them on ignore to be fair so can't see their posts haha! :)<br />

<br />
Yeah and guess what? The FF14 Mogstation is just as garbage and way more bloated. Nobody disagrees with that. The Companion App came under heavy fire for the crap it does too with those Kupo Nuts. And this is coming from someone who loves that game. <br />
<br />
The only upside is that the FF14 character services are considerably cheaper than WoWs. £5 for a race and appearance change compared to £19 in WoW and £12 for a transfer compared to £19 in WoW. Other than the Mogstation is just as garbage for only 5 years.<br />
<br />
As for extra retainer storage I agree. Either give us those for free or at least up the free limit to 5 or so.<br />
<br />
Another upside to it at least is that it doesn't try to shove a Mogstation button in the game itself.<br />
<br />
I honestly wish MTX weren't a thing in any game we are already paying a sub for. But right now Blizzard are proclaiming record quarters and yet somehow they still need to go out and beg players to fund their garbage esports for them. And you are right FF14 is just as guilty. I don't think anyone here would disagree. Hell I think they once said that the money doesn't fully go back into the game either.<br />
<br />
I think though FF14 is the only game where you can't directly buy currency yet thank god. I get why the WoW token and Gems to Gold thing in GW2 exists (to curb goldsellers and it's good) but imo I think it should be just earn it. Feels too easy if you buy it imo.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't helping itself doing this when it's in a huge slump.</div></div><hr />

Eapoe. His reply was &quot;Why? Because a company is putting up ways to fund prizes or their business practices? Guess every Girl Scout selling cookies, every run of popcorn from the Scouts, and every school that sells snacks are just money hungry cash grabs, right.?&quot; I mean he's comparing schools that run out of snacks to a company worth like 40 billion dollars so I think it's mentally incapacitated :/</div></div><hr />

AFAIR they leave Mogstation link in logon message instead.<br />
I agree that services are cheaper, but inventory space is one of my most hated aspects in the game, from unfilterable autoloot that clogs your bags with low level trash ingredients and potions to terrible glamour collection that's easily the worst system in AAA game (well, at least it has dyes, though only one channel). Managing your auction slots through retainers is fucking terrible too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah something you can get rid of with a click at least.<br />
<br />
WoW store button is always there.<br />
<br />
And yep I agree from a UI/QoL standpoint the game is archaic. Like I can't even do certain things if I'm speaking to an NPC or craft with mats from the saddlebag. Just 2 minor but irritating examples.<br />
<br />
However when I see the dev team and how they interact with the community on top of what I enjoy it just makes me want to play. Can't really say more than that.<br />
<br />
GW2 is another prime example. Again you can see a dev team that cares about making that Living World one of the best they can. And it has it's issues for me like lack of gear treadmill once you got BiS or the story can be a tad tiring at times (I'm just not fond of the pact stuff in the base game until close to Arah when it gets better). <br />
<br />
GW2, ESO and FF14 imo are what the MMO genre just needs. Games made by teams with passion. Of course neither of the 3 are perfect but you can see the work that goes into it.<br />
<br />
Not excusing or being oblivious to FF14s issues but I just get a better experience than I do with WoW. It doesn't help Blizzard have soured two of the franchises I loved as a kid either (Starcraft and Diablo).</div></div><hr />

The FF14 Mogstation is just as garbage and way more bloated. Nobody disagrees with that. The Companion App came under heavy fire for the crap it does too with those Kupo Nuts. And this is coming from someone who loves that game. <br />
<br />
The only upside is that the FF14 character services are considerably cheaper than WoWs. £5 for a race and appearance change compared to £19 in WoW and £12 for a transfer compared to £19 in WoW. Other than the Mogstation is just as garbage for only 5 years.<br />
<br />
As for extra retainer storage I agree. Either give us those for free or at least up the free limit to 5 or so.<br />
<br />
Another upside to it at least is that it doesn't try to shove a Mogstation button in the game itself.<br />
<br />
I honestly wish MTX weren't a thing in any game we are already paying a sub for. But right now Blizzard are proclaiming record quarters and yet somehow they still need to go out and beg players to fund their garbage esports for them. And you are right FF14 is just as guilty. I don't think anyone here would disagree. Hell I think they once said that the money doesn't fully go back into the game either.<br />
<br />
I think though FF14 is the only game where you can't directly buy currency yet thank god. I get why the WoW token and Gems to Gold thing in GW2 exists (to curb goldsellers and it's good) but imo I think it should be just earn it. Feels too easy if you buy it imo.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't helping itself doing this when it's in a huge slump.<br />
<br />
Almost everyone RMTs in FFXIV, either buying or selling, at the higher levels<br />
<br />
They sell runs to casuals for gil, then sell it for real money<br />
<br />
Not saying it doesn't happen in WoW, but FFXIV doesn't do shit about RMT, only if you say mean things to other people in roulette<br />
<br />
At least Blizzard bans bots once a year ;p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GW2, ESO and FF14 imo are what the MMO genre just needs. Games made by teams with passion. Of course neither of the 3 are perfect but you can see the work that goes into it.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
What a world we live in where people honestly believe this bullshit<br />
<br />
GW2 is a literal trash of GW1's methodology and spirit, it's a terrible cash grab that literally was launched half finished and broken, and literally exists to soak up money from people who still play it, they failed on signficantly more promises than Blizzard ever has, and destroyed their original fanbase, I don't even know who the hell plays the game any more, it gets what? sporadic story updates and 40 dollar expansions, that's it?<br />
<br />
FF14's only saving grace is the story, the PVE is pretty, but completely uninspired and easy, and the game has significantly more cash shop garbage that's marketed towards lonely NEETs that ERP in their house, with things significantly more egregious than a stupid $10 firework. <br />
<br />
Like friendly reminder that a consumable BASKET OF ORANGES is 5 dollars<br />
<br />
&quot;How they interact with a community&quot; is hilarious, kind of like how Yoshi said they had to timegate content because &quot;people do it too fast&quot; while releasing arbitrary grinding in Eureka?<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on when they gut PVP, from it's already terrible state to sate people who complained about &quot;too many buttons&quot; now every class is literally at most 4 buttons with fucking auto-combos<br />
<br />
Want to talk about class balance? There's classes that are literally ostracized for an entire expansion with no fixes in sight, If you played Heavensward, it didn't matter what the fuck your FFlogs were, good luck getting into groups if you were a Monk<br />
<br />
What a fucking joke<br />
<br />
I can't speak on ESO, never played it, but my god man, you're being so fucking ingenious it hurts, you might not like WoW, I mean fuck I dislike A LOT of things this expansion, but you're comparing a warm shit, to a lukewarm dog log</div></div><hr />

Again you can see a dev team that cares about making that Living World one of the best they can. And it has it's issues for me like lack of gear treadmill once you got BiS or the story can be a tad tiring at times (I'm just not fond of the pact stuff in the base game until close to Arah when it gets better). <br />
<br />
Well, it's mostly the other way round for me with FFXIV, I don't get the allure of vertical progression when all the gear is stat sticks with bigger stats every patch. Like what am I progressing to? Both me and bosses get more health and more damage at pretty much the same rate, meaning that nothing I do ever matters. Unless you are raidlogging, you spend most of the time scaled down in some roulette or in Eureka where your gear doesn't matter at all (after 350) which diminishes progression even further. I'm also not a fan of world designed mostly as MSQ decorations (the aspect I hated in SWTOR as well), leading to most of the population gathered in the big hubs and queueing for instanced content. I feel like it removes any pretense of massiveness in MMO. Eureka tried to solve that, but that's the only good thing I can say about Eureka.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And again they posted record profits.<br />
<br />
If they had no issue funding prize pools last year then they most certainly don't need the players to do it for them this year.<br />
<br />
As for Esports. The amount Blizzard put out for their games has always been pitiful. It really won't raise the pool in a grand manner. <br />
<br />
Imo Blizzard should have never taken this foray into esports except for SC2.</div></div><hr />

If it was free to play, and not the two listed above, nobody would care.<br />
<br />
Except people shouldn’t care anyways since these are cosmetic items that have no bearing on gameplay. At all. There’s no more arguement to be had. People are acting like these are micro transactions that are required to play and get power boosts like in EA’s Battlefront 2, and numerous other titles. These are toys that people can choose to get and will not have any gameplay advantage over anyone else, unless you count being able to change their appearance as some power boost.</div></div><hr />

Why are you upset?<br />
Neither of the toys give you any in-game advantage, they are purely cosmetic. The WoW shop has been full of things like that ever since it was added (like 10? years ago to this date).<br />

and you go to another park that is free entry, every ride has a 5$ cost to ride, and they charge a 25$ shirt.<br />
can i ask you, why is one aparently better then the other?<br />
<br />
So basically you got nothing? Good to know.</div></div><hr />

every year<br />
and they get praise for it<br />
this is the norm<br />
why is it fine when valve does it<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Valve is a private company and doesn't have to disclose it's earnings, so no idea where you get that claim of &quot;record profits every year&quot;, because no one but the shareholders will know, or what they choose to release.<br />
<br />
Also, Valve hasn't been releasing substandard content, milking their customers for every penny recently, been releasing a wave of below par products, but charging a premium.<br />
It SHOULDN'T be &quot;the norm&quot;, it is &quot;the norm&quot; because morons go &quot;hurr durr take mah wallet!&quot; and hand over money for something.<br />
There is also a vast par of difference between Valve and their DOTA and e-sport games, and Blizzard with whatever shite they are trying to peddle as &quot;competitive gaming&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, you are really limited in your arguments here, it is only not well constructed, but poorly argued, and you are assuming the two companies are even remotely the same, they really aren't.<br />
As I said, I would love to have brains like yours, the ability to twist anything, no matter how asinine and utterly insane, into &quot;Not their fault, it's ok&quot; is utterly amazing.</div></div><hr />

The design department has nothing to do with it, the people who make the shit decision to put it in the store do.

you seem to forget they own steam... which makes an insane amount of money with its online game marketplace monopoly.<br />
a simple googlesearch shows stuff like steam alone earning 4.3 billion in 2017<br />
2011 the company was only worth 2-4 billion and was the most profitable company per employee in the united states.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;valve hasn't been releasing substandard content&quot; you mean artifact? that lost 99% of its players in a month?<br />
oh no they charge a premium like crazy, you must not play valve games like portal 2 with its cosmetics, TF2 with its loot crates and over expensive hats, dota 2 same, lootcrates and over expensive items.<br />

so please tell me, why is it fine valve takes 75% of the profit from the items, but not fine when blizz does it?</div></div><hr />

they already have 800 toys ingame<br />
they added a good 100 of them in BFA<br />
so stop saying &quot;would be cool thing if they made these obtainable in game&quot;<br />
cause you have picked up atleast 40 toys in BFA that you literally would never give any shit about, but these two you are freaking out about cause &quot;they could have been special&quot; no they would have been like the 40 toys you picked up, equipped, then never touched ever</div></div><hr />

To play the current expansion you must buy it.<br />

Why does TF2, an arena based shooting game that is F2P need new content? Why? The player base is happy with how it is, and the cosmetics pay to keep the servers up and the game running. It is basically a game that runs itself. It is also, *shock* f2p without a box price nor subscription cost. They are two completely differing business models, or are you a bit too dim to grasp this? Or, most likely, just ignoring it because it doesn't agree with your agenda.<br />
You are comparing apples and oranges and telling everyone else to 'stfu' if they disagree with you.<br />
Valve and their games utilise entirely differing business models and strategies, they have no sub-based games that rake in said money thqt also have a box price for the main game and expansion content. This is a KEY difference, but you are utterly ignoring it, and just rambling on.<br />
<br />
Putting you on ignore, you are just wittering away saying nothing of any import.<br />
<br />
And again, for the second time, link the part where i said &quot;rushing out items&quot;. You used quotes, implying I said that. Not inferring, not hinting, but actually SAYING, which is why I am asking, again WHERE did I say that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think they have the new guys working on something magical, new and shiny for WoW, well I have a Nigerian Prince I want you to meet, and some magic beans I want to sell you. You are arguing in favour of shitty business practices, in</div></div><hr />

In all seriousness though, fuck Blizzard for this. $7.50 per purchase going into their pockets for something that gives you a temporary appearance swap of already existing models or a firework of your faction that has the requirement of planting it in an enemy corpse.

The definition is literally not buy to play. Sure you need to pay for a expansion, but if you are new to the game you don't need to pay for a base game. Like ff14 where you need base game and sub.<br />

Like I know you have a hate boner for Blizzard, but they literally don't require you to buy anything to play WoW outside of a subscription.</div></div><hr />

You are joking right? &quot;Ruining the game market&quot;? The game market is fucked beyond belief with gold inflation. On top of that there is the token people buy for 20 dollars that only provides 15 in Bnet balance. I mean it works for me because I have 20+ million gold so I get whatever I want thanks to those tokens. But the market was fucked before that token ever hit the game.</div></div><hr />

These toys should be in the game, what purpose do they serve being in the shop?

I mean keep in mind some of us buy these things with in game gold converted into Bnet tokens. I buy any cash store mount/pet/toy/whatever because I have more than enough gold to do so. I wouldn't pay real money for that stuff, however.

Blizzard boasted during the dismissal of staff about putting more resources into WoW.

People always do that with this game. Any time someone gives good, valid criticism others come along and go &quot;it's not so bad! you're overreacting&quot; and then we hemorrhage subs, less content is added, quality goes down, etc.<br />

I believe he means the gaming market as a whole. People who buy items like this, help support and fuel the game devs idea that it is okay to do this.

There are plenty of valid criticisms made as to why the game has been in a downward trend for a long time. However blaming 2 toys on a cash shop is such a minor thing when compared to long gaps between raids, not enough raid bosses in said raids, lack of new dungeons etc. <br />
<br />
And do you REALLY think it takes a lot of people on their dev team to make a couple toys? Cmon now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I mean there could be an argument that microtransactions, on disc DLC, DLC added later and so on are bad for games, but they aren't nearly as bad as some of the other issues like loot crates, p2w elements and the like. People can rail against those things sure but some of it is unlikely to go away. For someone that is offended by X practice there is person Y there to spend money on something they want. Until an outcry is loud enough with people voting with their wallets to stop something, it won't stop.</div></div><hr />

Because some companies like making extra money? Why should every mount/pet/toy be in game? Because you pay a sub? Because you are special? We've had this shit going back 12+ years with the card game in TBC. I'm sorry. But those things were WAY worse than these cash shop things ever where. Know why? Because I can at least get the fucking thing on the shop and not worry about finding some random scratch off card on Ebay. <br />
<br />
I could understand being pissed if this cash shop was being added in just today but this cash shop has been here for years and before that there was the card game pets/mounts/toys.<br />

Yup, I've been playing since Vanilla, decided on day 1 that I didn't want to buy the CE because I didn't really feel like minipets and I didn't know how the game would be. Too bad so sad for me because there is no way to get those pets now unless I shell out 4,000 dollars or more. Oops?</div></div><hr />

Who cares if people are dumb enough to buy them or where the proceeds go. Mounts are the same way. Tons of people buy them and then they realize they're not nearly as special as mounts that take achievements or farming and they stop using them. It can be argued that a few of the pets are top tier and very useful over other in-game pets if you're a pet battler... but it's just pokelol. Not game breaking.<br />

Blizz could very easily sell gear or stat bonuses or whatever else that would actually impact the game, but they don't. The IG store is harmless. Let people spend their money how they want.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard Esports Prize Pools will be paid for by Blizzard regardless, so any purchase through Blizzard is in effect funding the prize pool. The fact that they are using this &quot;Support WoW Esports&quot; angle to push micro-transactions is just really disingenuous and dishonest in my opinion. It really says a lot about a company when they engage in these kinds of practices. I honestly wouldn't have a problem with micro-transactions if it wasn't for the fact that Blizzard is already charging you for both for the game and also for a subscription.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to come off as negative Nancy, nor a doomsayer, nor am I saying that this is the &quot;End of WoW&quot; or any similar ridiculous statements. However, this is only the beginning of an entirely new level of micro-transactions in WoW. The fact that they are using this &quot;Support WoW Esports&quot; tactic makes it clear to me that more of this is on the way. They are going to slowly introduce more and more micro-transactions until nothing is off the table and everything becomes as accepted as the store mounts and pets have become.<br />
<br />
In the future Blizzard will be looking to their most die-hard fans and the whales to spend more and more of their money on micro-transactions. Character Services, In-game Gold, Mounts, Pets, Transmog, and Toys will soon enough make way for things like XP Bonus Potions and other exclusive items that cannot be obtained any other way.</div></div><hr />

The main difference between other games and WoW is that WoW charges you both full price for the game, and a subscription fee. Most other games with micro-transactions don't have a subscription fee.

<br />
&quot;hey guys we have esports coming up! but only 1 team applied so like... i guess they win the 50$ giftcard to applebees...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suspicious how they never offered any monetary way to support that eSports community, from their f2p game, huh?<br />
It's almost like they're really just looking to milk players for money - not actually support the communities. <br />
<br />
<br />
so wait, are the toys literal trash, or are they cash grabs? I am confused. how would they make it &quot;turely about the community&quot; how would you recommend they change it to be &quot;for the community&quot;<br />
<br />
They can be both? They're not mutually exclusive. These use in-game assets to do fireworks or a quick model swap - which is tech that has been in the game for 13 years. So they were low effort - I wouldn't and never called them trash - but they're still charging extra cash for them. <br />
And its obvious - make the ratio of contribution not 3-to-1 in favor of Blizzard profiteering from &quot;supporting&quot; their community. You must be able to grasp that, yeah?<br />
<br />
<br />
and if a fucking toy is someones final straw, they really are weak and should go to a therapist<br />
its like that dude who stabbed someone over mac n cheese<br />
<br />
If you can't see how this represents a departure from the values and commitment Blizzard once held for it's players, that is on you. <br />
That said, your hyperbolic statement about mac'n'cheese and therapists because someone quits a game over business ethics demonstrates a lacking of of nuance and subtly. <br />
<br />
<br />
I mean they have been selling toys since vanilla, the TCG cards were super exspensive, and i am sure blizz made a ton of money off those<br />
<br />
Valid. Though slightly different as Blizzard wasn't advertising those as being a means to &quot;support eSports&quot; while funneling 75% of the profits to themselves.<br />
In the past, they've made items that were to support causes 100% of the proceeds.</div></div><hr />

Yes those were shitty too, I aint going to say they were not. But please continue to tell me why I shouldn't be offended by toxic predatory practices, while you continue to support them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oof the 'it's cosmetic' excuse. As if that makes predatory practices okay. As I said it's not about the items, it;s about the way in which they are sold.<br />
<br />
Oof, the dismissal excuse. Used by many people thru the years that have no valid arguement against what was stated. What’s wrong with how they are sold? There’s nothing commanding you to buy them. There’s nothing you will miss out on that affects character progression or power levels. <br />
Also, as many others have pointed out, you don’t even need to pay real money for these things as you can just use in game gold. <br />
It’s truly sad that when people complain about something and act like the company is making them buy something, note the use of the term making them as if it’s mandatory, just to have it pointed out it’s something that’s not necessary and cosmetic only that they flip out and try to justify their outrage with the equivalent of “not what you said but how you said it.”</div></div><hr />

You know what? I got like 10million in goods laying around that I just would have to sell. But I'm at a point with Blizz that I'm thinking about not even doing that cause buying tokens for gold means that Blizz actually gets MORE money from someone else(which was the only reason they introduced those tokens to begin with)...and I don't have the feeling they deserve that for the way they currently try to milk players.<br />
It's been a long way from the player that would have preordered any Blizzard title without of knowing more about it than the name.</div></div><hr />

100% agree, have had a hard time figuring out why anyone cares about microtransactions in WoW as they 100% do not affect gameplay, seem to be pretty minimal in terms of development, and theoretically use that money towards improving the long term goals of the game and developing things like classic wow.<br />
<br />
My only guess is that people are mad at Blizz/Activision for their recent actions (Diablo Mobile w/o D4, Layoffs with record profit + exec bonus) and use microtransactions as another sign that the ethos of the company has changed when in reality microtransactions would have existed regardless... Its especially true because there are a lot of people who have been playing WoW for 10+ years, and that emotional and time investment is only compounding their disdain for recent actions.</div></div><hr />

And yes I do pay a sub, that is exactly why we shouldn't be charged extra. Why should I pay extra. Blizzard reported records earnings. You think they need that extra money? You think Bobby Kotick is struggling to eat and live?<br />
<br />
Dude do you think the CEO would be making any less money if there was no cash shop? Get real. CEO pay is bloated as all hell and everyone knows it. It isn't just a Blizz issue. They would find other ways to squeeze money out of people and have done so. Remember the Blizz token? 20 dollars a token for 15 dollars of value. They are laughing all the way to the bank. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry you are pissed off over trivial things like a sparkle pony and toys on the cash shop. At least now you can earn gold in game and buy Bnet tokens and buy them if you are so inclined. I love Bnet balance, I haven't had to pay for the last 2 or 3 expansions, any of the store mounts/pets/toys or hell anything Blizz related that isn't on the blizz gear store.</div></div><hr />

Just saddens me is all, and even now you see people defending it, just below you is a 'Well just 2 toys out of 600+, why worry?&quot;, without grasping this is one of those &quot;test the water&quot; situations.<br />
If these are a success, we will see more, and more, and then possibly in-game content being added as a &quot;Test&quot;.<br />
<br />
Heck, would love to see the argument for quest packs. &quot;Well, there is already 8000+ quests in game, why are you whining about 10+ more added to a shop? It's entirely optional!&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Did you bring out the pitchforks and torches during TBC when the card game had special mounts, pets, toys and so on? Remember the spectral tiger mount? <br />
<br />
Did you bring out the pitchforks the first time the cash shop came around selling mounts? This shit has been around for Y E A R S and now they added some toys to go with mounts/pets on the store. If this is where the 'test the water' is at after 14+ years, I think we'll be okay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because microtransactions aren't acceptable in a game that has an existing business system with a box price and monthly subscription.<br />
<br />
It is entirely ignorable, sure, but it just leaves a bad taste in many people's mouth. When I pay front-price for a game I want to have a complete experience that I can enjoy fully without having to pay more for some parts of it. Even worse when I'm also paying a subscription fee as well.<br />
<br />
If the box price and monthly subscription is not a working business model that sustains the game as well as allows them to invest in the long term goals of the game, then it needs to be reviewed - not just sprinkled with microtransactions.<br />
<br />
It just feeds an industry-wide idea of creating monetization systems disguised as games, instead of creating good games and then making money out of them. The whole &quot;games as a service&quot; is way too prevalent and has brought the industry to an unsustainable place that will likely sooner or later crash.</div></div><hr />

How long have you been playing? Because micro transactions existed in VANILLA for fucks sake. Remember paid server transfers? Vanilla. The complete experience based on your wording would be the ability to race change, faction change, server change, any store mount/pet etc. Yeah you wish.<br />

I play both FF XIV and WoW, and I gotta say that the amount of bullshit (and new unique mounts lately like the whale/fat cat) in FF XIV shop is over the top, and akin to a f2p game, compared to WoW's seemingly much more limited cash shop, for a game that is 14 years old, not 5 (if we discount the failed 1.0 release). And afaik, you are a big supporter of FF XIV. So way to go with your double standards my dude. Keep dropping lower and lower.</div></div><hr />

A server transfer is not added content, it's a service. A mount, a toy, or transmog pieces are added content. You're comparing apples and oranges.

<br />
It is entirely ignorable, sure, but it just leaves a bad taste in many people's mouth. When I pay front-price for a game I want to have a complete experience that I can enjoy fully without having to pay more for some parts of it. Even worse when I'm also paying a subscription fee as well.<br />
<br />
If the box price and monthly subscription is not a working business model that sustains the game as well as allows them to invest in the long term goals of the game, then it needs to be reviewed - not just sprinkled with microtransactions.<br />
<br />
It just feeds an industry-wide idea of creating monetization systems disguised as games, instead of creating good games and then making money out of them. The whole &quot;games as a service&quot; is way too prevalent and has brought the industry to an unsustainable place that will likely sooner or later crash.<br />
<br />
Pretty much. A sub based game having MTX irritates me.<br />
<br />
FF14 has them and it admittedly rubs me the wrong way. However it at least provides a fun and quality experience unlike WoW so the MTX in that game are definitely not affecting the games quality.<br />

Cosmetic or not, it's extra stuff we have to pay for when we already purchase the game and pay a monthly fee. Micro-transactions do not belong in a paid subscription game.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people also take issue with the amount that's even going to the prize pool - a whopping 25%. A that's only going to the prize pool for a limited time. But this is also grubbing for money after their own reports of record profits. See how this starts to not add up? A company that makes billions of dollars a year needs us to contribute to a prize pool $2.50 at a time, while they take $7.50 in profit per transaction.</div></div><hr />

C'mon man you can't handwave the BS in FF14 because you are getting a 'quality experience'. I feel I am getting a quality experience in WoW because of the raiding so I continue to play it.

I wouldn't consider those serveices as any part of the experience. It's things that have very little to do with the game and its gameplay, and definitely not something that you would be able to acquire or experience through the game. They were external technical services that had very little to do with the actual concept of the game, and that at time actually probably made sense since realms used to have their own individual physical servers and databases, and it would likely require a fair amount of human interaction.<br />
<br />
Hell, if you're gonna give an example of early actual content behind a pay wall, at least go for the in-game TCG loot.<br />
<br />
Regardless, the fact something that you might consider &quot;microtransactions&quot; existed from the start doesn't make it any more acceptable that they exist now. Especially since they keep adding more and more of them.<br />
<br />
It changes nothing about what I said.</div></div><hr />

I don't agree with the cash shop in either game.<br />
<br />
However one for me is a more enjoyable and fun experience and the other isn't.<br />

I've said countless times WoW is in my top 10 games of all time. And that's a hard thing to get into when it comes to games I like.

It's literally not. There's a difference between a service, and a piece of in-game content. Or do you think that having your car moved from garage X to garage Y is the same thing as getting a new wheel cover?<br />
<br />
The card loot were closer to the first loot boxes. You can't call it a micro-transaction for loot if you don't know if you'll actually get loot (not just bad loot, but any loot at all as far as WoW is concerned).<br />
<br />

<br />
Service vs. content. A transaction for a service, which at the time required backend work to be done for it, and a new toy cannot be compared. The former isn't a micro-transaction anymore than having a mechanic look at your car - it's payment for a service. This is unlike purchasing additional digital goods with real money within a game that you already pay to play.</div></div><hr />

And yet if you were around in Vanilla you'd have see those types of complaints from people who felt they paid the box price + sub fee and so these &quot;services&quot; should be included for free. Only later did these things expand into mounts that started a whole nother argument.</div></div><hr />

I mean we're still arguing opinion. I felt FF's expansion were pretty shitty and didn't make it past a month. I'm pretty tired of their microtransactions for extra retainers, special pets etc. It is the same types of things Blizz does but they go even further. I'd love both companies to 'wake up' and provide game experiences that are about more fun, less timegating and RNG. <br />
<br />
WoW has some glaring issues, no question. Do I think they can turn it around? Honestly? I doubt it. I think they'll keep doing more of the same with every expansion and I don't think any groundbreaking thing will happen that makes people come back in droves. I have to wonder if in some ways it is just the way MMOs are now because really none of them are going to hit 10mil+ players again.</div></div><hr />

I checked out the item and the biggest part of the text shows 10 Minute CD. Blue text or not, the CD timer is what most people are going to see instead of reading text. Lots of people bought it for that. <br />
At the very least, it’s conflicting information between the CD timer and the 60 minute one. I would hope Blizz does something to compensate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it's people literally mad that these things exist. That Blizzard made them because they actually sell.<br />
<br />
And how does this hurt the consumer, exactly? If there are people willing to buy these items, who is being hurt? The people not buying them? How? They're fun little toys that aren't in any way necessary to have. Does it hurt you that people might buy them and have fun with them, and you can't/won't? Grow the fuck up then.</div></div><hr />

Did you bring out the pitchforks and torches during TBC when the card game had special mounts, pets, toys and so on? Remember the spectral tiger mount? <br />
<br />
Did you bring out the pitchforks the first time the cash shop came around selling mounts? This shit has been around for Y E A R S and now they added some toys to go with mounts/pets on the store. If this is where the 'test the water' is at after 14+ years, I think we'll be okay.<br />
<br />
Stop with the hyperbole and the crap comparisions.<br />
The markets were vastly different then, and they were vastly different products. The TCG game was literally a seperate game with an added bonus for its source material, you bought the cards to play the trading card game, you didn't buy them specifically from Blizzard itself to obtain something. <br />
<br />
You are just using a strawman argument and a half to justify whatever nonsense you're trying to peddle, the two aren't remotely comparable regardless of what you may think.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Record breaking profits&quot;.... can't even fund their own esports prize pool without begging for money from it's playerbase.<br />

You guys bitch and complain as though no one has ever done this before. Valve as done it with Dota 2. Riot has done it with League. HiRez Studios does it with Smite. Eoic with Fortnite and I am sure EA and Apex Legends will do it too. None of them are hurting for money, and more importantly, NO ONE COMPLAINS WHEN THEY DO IT.<br />

However blaming 2 toys on a cash shop is such a minor thing when compared to long gaps between raids, not enough raid bosses in said raids, lack of new dungeons etc. <br />
<br />
And do you REALLY think it takes a lot of people on their dev team to make a couple toys? Cmon now.<br />
<br />
Minor things lead to bigger things.<br />
<br />
Like those long content droughts - they were shorter and then when the players didn't complain too much, they grew progressively longer until mass unsubbing happened. Notice how we haven't had a long content drought since WoD?<br />
<br />
And the same goes for raids. WoD had terrible raids, I don't think they'll make that mistake again.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, if people are okay with &quot;2 toys&quot; they'll eventually put more things in the cash shop. You can say I'm being dramatic, but stuff like this was called way back when. People said &quot;oh they're only going to put a few mounts, stop whining&quot; and then it proceeded to WoW Tokens, Exclusive Transmog, and now Toys. The future doesn't look good.</div></div><hr />

Literally every game you just listed is a F2P game that does not charge for box price or sub. F2P games have MTX in to fund them otherwise they would die out. WoW could easily survive on sub fee and service charges alone.<br />
<br />
WoW is a sub based box price game. It should not need to charge for MTX. Same with FF14. The only thing that should have a cost are character services.<br />
<br />
But sure keep acting as though it's comparable to what F2P games do. Shows you lot have no actual debate point anyway.</div></div><hr />

I think the frequency is also a factor here. When it was a Mount and a pet once a year it didn't seem too much of a big deal (and the pet has generally had all proceeds go to charity for the main buying splurge from players). Since BFA there have been the Dreadwake, two mounts, two pets, the last chance deal for the transmog helms and now these toys.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2019-03-20, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just curious why they're funding a very small cash pool for eSports from this. 100k is nothing, to a corporation the size of Blizzard. Especially for the end event, that will surely have sponsors. Hell, t-shirts for the season would probably sell better. Or bowling shirts, that the devs seem to love so much. (too much craft beer - bowling shirts)<br />
<br />
Edit: I guess this is normal for eSports funding? Eh. I don't really care. I'm just enjoying my popcorn and the fainting couches being pulled out again.<br />
<br />
Not a huge conspiracy, just kind of puzzling is all. And, the 25% they're throwing at the prize pool for a limited time...odd. That's all. Not a race down the valley with a pitchfork issue, just kind of...huh...<br />
<br />
And, first toys on the cash shop...yeah, it's a shitshow. How could it be anything else? :D <br />
<br />
Ah, yeah, just checked, Heelvs is back on his Blizzard rant train. LOL. Drama train arriving, all aboard!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Advertise an item, sell an item, and then change the item to be something other than they bought.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arch0s</div><div class="date">2019-03-20, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I initially posted this in the thread titled &quot;New In-Game Shop Toys - final thing for me&quot; as I didn't see this thread.<br />
<br />
I'm copying it into here in case anyone here might find it useful:<br />
<br />
As an avid toy collector (521/566!) I decided to use some gold to buy these toys with tokens.<br />
<br />
Used the transmorpher and got turned into some sort of Farakki troll (possibly the antagonist from the horde story in Vol'dun).<br />
<br />
Cool, hi-res unique model etc. I test animations with whirlwind...and oh god....old animations....why am I surprised.<br />
<br />
Edit: hitting a target dummy (still as the sand troll) and all animations are the old ones. I do intermittently yell &quot;Watch yer Step!&quot; with it being voiced too.<br />
<br />
Edit 2:Tried it on a number of alts.<br />
<br />
Keli'dan the Breaker (Fel Orc - last boss of Blood Furnace) x2<br />
<br />
Skadi the Ruthless (Frosty Vrykul - third boss of Utgarde Pinnacle)<br />
<br />
Grand Warlock Alythess (Eredar - red Eredar twin from Sunwell Plateau)<br />
<br />
Akil'zon (Bird avater - first boss of Zul'Aman) - this one was pretty cool<br />
<br />
Sun Tenderheart (Female Pandaren - second boss of Siege of Orgimmar) - uses modern animations<br />
<br />
Corla, Herald of Twilight (Female human - second boss of Blackrock Caverns) - uses modern animations<br />
<br />
Grand Magus Telestra (Female High Elf [holy shit guys playable high elf?!?] first boss of The Nexus) <br />
<br />
It seems you yell (with audio) their encounter start dialogue and then intermittently yell other bits of their dialogue during combat.<br />
<br />
Going to leave it there for now, hopefully this gives some information to you all. I suppose it is most comparable to the Coin of Many Faces with added voice lines and usable more frequently. I guess I quite like it actually :).</div></div><hr />

It does beg the question, with all of the devs they have working on WoW, they can't take 5 minutes to check the stats on an item before they make it available?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monkiy</div><div class="date">2019-03-20, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And yet if you were around in Vanilla you'd have see those types of complaints from people who felt they paid the box price + sub fee and so these &quot;services&quot; should be included for free. Only later did these things expand into mounts that started a whole nother argument.<br />
<br />
I was around in Vanilla. I saw those complaints. I disagreed with them then, and I disagree with them now. The fact that the complaints existed doesn't change that your comparison is flatly wrong, and that those services literally don't fit the definition of a micro-transaction.</div></div><hr />

I mean that is a classic logical fallacy you are hitting on. Just because it is 2 toys it does not mean it is going to blowup into more and more things on the cash shop.</div></div><hr />
