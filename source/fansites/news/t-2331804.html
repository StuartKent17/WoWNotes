We were able to sit down with Steve Burke, Senior Game Designer on World of Warcraft, for a quick interview! Here is a recap:<br />
<br />
Classic Servers<br />
Q: When did you decide that there was enough support to go ahead with classic WoW servers?<br />
A: Internally it has always been a huge discussion. Obviously there is a lot of external desire as well. It's just a monumental task and so it's a matter of setting it up right.<br />
<br />
Q: Will classic servers and the current game be bundled together? Are they using the same client and under your normal subscription?<br />
A: These are fantastic questions that haven't been answered internally yet. Development is still super early and a lot of work needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Q: Vanilla had a lot of mechanics/issues that might not be fun anymore. Are there any specific issues or mechanics you are looking at addressing in classic servers?<br />
A: Team wants to keep the experience as close to Vanilla as possible, but it is also too early to answer.<br />
<br />
Q: What thoughts/considerations have been taken into account for patching of the classic servers? Vanilla forever or slow expansion relaunches?<br />
A: Another great question that has yet to be decided!<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth<br />
Q: Will the Heart of Azeroth be spec agnostic or will we have to put Azerite into all of our different specs much like the different artifact weapons in Legion?<br />
A: The Heart of Azeroth is what unlocks the different abilities on three pieces of armor and so it is all tied to the neck piece which is used on all specs.<br />
<br />
Q: Are spec specific legendaries continuing in Battle for Azeroth?<br />
A: The Legion legendary system is being retired in a very epic way, but not something to be revealed yet. Team learned a lot from the system and liked a lot of aspects of it, however, they are not ready to reveal the future of acquiring legendaries.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the current races in WoW receive unique Heritage Armor similar to the new Allied Races?<br />
A: As of right now Heritage Armor is only for the Allied Races. The armor is also only wearable by the Allied Race it is designed for.<br />
<br />
Q: How are rewards going to be done for Warfronts?<br />
A: Safe to say Azerite will play a role in rewards, but the rest is still being ironed out.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the new AI take place in dungeons as well?<br />
A: Right now the AI is being focused in Islands and Warfronts.<br />
<br />
Q: Are class specific buffs such as Mark of the Wild and Power Word: Fortitude returning?<br />
A: As of right now these buffs are back in the playtest. Team always looks at classes and how to make them more flavorful and the class buffs fit that niche.<br />
<br />
Q: Will max level content be added to the old word?<br />
A: Team wants to focus max level content into the new continents. The great thing about this expansion is each faction has three leveling zones and then another three open up when max level is reached.<br />
<br />
Q: So would a Horde 110 character just starting to level on Zandalar a few weeks into the expansion run into max level Alliance and vice versa?<br />
A: Yes. The whole world is open to your character upon reaching max level.<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be other options to unlock Allied Races?<br />
A: Each Allied race has some prerequisite quest content required to unlock them. Also, Allied Races are allowed to be boosted to 110 once unlocked, but only physically leveling them from 20-120 gives you the Heritage Armor.<br />
<br />
Q: Allied Races are set to start at level 20 when created. Where will they be placed in the world upon being created? Will they be in their respective zones?<br />
A: The current plan is for the Allied Races to start in their faction's main hub when created.<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be any new class/race combinations?<br />
A: Nothing to announce on that, but not ruling it out. Team doesn't want every race able to be any class.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you tell us about some of the racials for the other Allied Races?<br />
A: They will all have unique racials but some aren't ready to be discussed yet.<br />
<br />
Q: Any tinkering to be done to current racials?<br />
A: Team isn't ruling it out, but nothing to discuss.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the mission table/follower system carry forward into Battle for Azeroth?<br />
A: The team likes the follower system and would like to move forward with it, but nothing to announce as of now.<br />
<br />
Q: How will flying work in Battle for Azeroth?<br />
A: Team like flying being something that takes time to unlock. They want to see that you completed the content before you can fly above it.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you tell us a bit more about the stat squish?<br />
A: There is definitely another stat squish happening. Team wants numbers to be reasonable and work hard to make sure old content doesn't become hard to solo with the squish.<br />
<br />
Q: Are you continuing with professions in Battle for Azeroth similar to how they were in Legion?<br />
A: Can't say for sure, but team definitely wants there to be content for professions, but maybe not quite as many quests.<br />
<br />
Q: Any changes to professions other than the typical new recipes and 100 skill points?<br />
A: Definitely all that but also trying to tie some of the professions into the Heart of Azeroth system. No specifics yet.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the team address faction imbalance on realms?<br />
A: The new WPVP system will solve a lot of these issues as sharding technology will place you into shards with others who have opted into WPVP.</div></div><hr />

WHELP! I'm never flagging up again. Not that I flag up much as is, not a pvper, but knowing that flagging up will throw me into a balanced shard of others who are flagged...nope do not want. This is probably great news for people who want world pvp though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were you expecting to be able to swap races at the barber or something? There's no other way to play a different race than paying money, be it a boosted alt or paid race change; or leveling an alt naturally.<br />
<br />
The incentive of leveling one is having a max level (insert race here) w/o paying money for a boost or race changing an alt. The (hopefully sweet looking armor) is just a bonus reward.</div></div><hr />

P.S.<br />
Heritage armor for all races are not planned yet? Why? They really need to make 6 sets only for now (and seems they have more or less done them already). A raid tier has double that. They should, slowly, make one for other races, its, after all, only cosmetic stuff.</div></div><hr />

They could've atleast found a way for people to switch their mains to the new race, I wouldn't mind leveling my main up again as the new race while keeping everything I've collected and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My prediction is they will do it (especially if there's interest in the community [and I bet there is!]), but it will be tied behind a quest chain that's race specific. It'll probably be a patch feature at some point, possibly even tying into whatever is happening during BfA at the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seeing as how zandalari classes havent been revealed yet i can certainly see a fun surprise like paladin being included there. and i really do hope the moonfangs are leading to nelf paladins in bfa</div></div><hr />

Why? They actually learnt from Cata that placing max levelling content all over two continents was a bad idea and people in general hated it.</div></div><hr />

&quot; As of right now&quot;<br />
&quot;The current plan&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing to announce on that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course you don't lie to the playerbase, but being unspecific isn't working either.<br />
Great MMO-C got to ask questions nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the other &quot;new&quot; races were released, the only option to have one w/o paying money was to level one from scratch. It's almost certain to be the same way this time around as well.<br />
<br />
Most collectibles are account wide (pets, t-mog options, etc), so that shouldn't be much of a factor anymore.<br />
<br />
There's really no downside to having an alt at this stage of the game.</div></div><hr />

Why did they even put in more races than just humans for alliance and orcs for horde? You seem to just be crying about pointless shit. There will be a lot of people playing these new races, just as there are many people playing different races today, just because you don't see a point in it doesn't mean it's a stupid idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not crying about anything pal, I'm just saying alot of people are attached to their main character and probably would like to be a sub/allied race but can't unless they race change - that's fair but not ideal. Not everyone wants alts and after leveling one they'll probably just collect dust.<br />
<br />
The prestige armor isn't too ideal aswel, it would've been nice to use it on other same-type characters aswel.<br />
<br />
Now it's pretty much, once again, if you want to be the new race we've made you gotta spend money. And if you also want that prestige armor you have to level up some new character aswel. How is that not stupid :p</div></div><hr />

Well, it's been this way since TBC o_O<br />
<br />
My mage was Undead, but when TBC came out I decided I wanted to play as BE mage, sadly, there's only one option: level yet another mage. Needless to say, I wasn't enthusiastic about doing so.<br />

They clearly have barely begun on it; they just wanted to announce it so people would stop complaining. Will the leveling be as slow as it used to be? Are raids still going to be 40-man? Will there still only be one difficulty, or will they make multiple like it is now? Will resistance gear farming still be a thing? Will arduous rep grinds still be present? Will the LFG queue exist? Will achievements exist? Will the collection journal exist? (Please god, I hope it does. That is one thing that will absolutely not be an improvement if they go back to how it was.) Really the main question is - how much work are they going to put into it? Are they actually going to work on it and change stuff, or are they just going to make sure it's stable and put it out there? Hard to say what the better option is, honestly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomana</div><div class="date">2017-11-05, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why? They actually learnt from Cata that placing max levelling content all over two continents was a bad idea and people in general hated it.<br />
<br />
What people hated in Cata (imho) was more the fact there was not much to do in open world besides a handful of dailies.<br />
While adding objectives all over the old world and throw in random events like PVP skirmishes, invasions etc. would add much more longevity to the game. As is stands right know, despite being changed (sharded), the old world will once again be content-less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm talking about is that people didn't like that relevant zones were so far apart, that's why Blizz returned to new zones being clumped together.<br />
<br />
And old world is pretty much untouched in BfA, only couple of zones get phased at max level, e.g., Tirisfal Glades, there's also info that Arathi is only phased during warfronts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, but if there are objectives everywhere (or at least in a significant portion of zones), IMHO this argument would not apply.<br />
Otherwise, in its current implementation, it makes Horde and Alliance go on a full scale war, but still somehow limit actions to a small number of new zones (plus warfronts of course, the extent of which remains to be seen).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No more PvP/PvE realms, you can switch on/off your PvP tag at will. Having PvP on will give you bonus xp/reputation, and you'll be phased with other PvP-on people it seems.</div></div><hr />

I really don’t get why everyone is snarking about this. Obviously he’s not gonna answer questions about things they’re not done with yet. Why would he?</div></div><hr />

&quot; As of right now&quot;<br />
&quot;The current plan&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing to announce on that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course you don't lie to the playerbase, but being unspecific isn't working either.<br />
Great MMO-C got to ask questions nonetheless.<br />
<br />
LOL -- agreed.<br />
<br />
It's almost like they are tired of hearing people whine about things that were &quot;promised&quot; and Blizz being guilty of &quot;overhyping&quot; things. People constantly complain Blizzard doesn't listen to players -- well, maybe they have been listening to some of those criticisms and this is the result. <br />
<br />
Still, I agree with you that being evasive is not the way to go. I get that there has to be some way to rein in expectations but there has to be a more eloquent middle ground than outright dodging everything.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone wants alts and after leveling one they'll probably just collect dust.<br />
<br />
The prestige armor isn't too ideal aswel, it would've been nice to use it on other same-type characters aswel.<br />
<br />
Now it's pretty much, once again, if you want to be the new race we've made you gotta spend money. And if you also want that prestige armor you have to level up some new character aswel. How is that not stupid :p<br />
<br />
And still, that's exactly the way it has worked ever since they made race change available, so why would it be so different now?</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the exact same thing. The new expansion looks...functional, I guess but there seems a distinct lack of hype or energy about it. Blizzard really did not seem overly excited or even interested in talking about the expansion. Elements like sub-race glossed up to be &quot;new races&quot; smack of low effort and hardly help matters in this regard.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile we had no class panels, no talks on professions and fairly minimal information all around and this is frigging Blizzcon. If Blizzard cannot get excited about something here, I have to say I am more than a little worried.</div></div><hr />

Cause whole interview is actually pointless. Not being able to reveal everything is a given. Avoiding every single question make it useless.<br />
<br />
Could stayed 10 minutes longer on the toilets, better use of their time.</div></div><hr />

Okaaay... Well that's not the fault of the guy being interviewed. The person who asks the questions is responsible for picking things that are, y'know, likely to be answerable.<br />
<br />
Interviews are hard, and sometimes the things you want to know are things that can't be answered right away. That ain't Burke's issue.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, the pre-picked questions they had during the officail Q&amp;A were also pretty much answered with - We can't say or don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems very likely. Although they did a great job with Legion.<br />
<br />
The opt-in came out earlier too, so that means it's more ready than Legion was during the announcement.</div></div><hr />
