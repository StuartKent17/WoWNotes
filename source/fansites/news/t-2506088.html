With hotfixes that we are currently deploying to all WoW Classic realms, we are substantially increasing the number of players that can be simultaneously logged in and playing.

<br />
Opening too many servers can go wrong in the long term. They should just increase server cap dramatically. I prefer to play with lag then not play at all</div></div><hr />

More realm capacity theoretically means more layers. The size of the layer you're placed on won't change much. The crowding is simply because a lot of people are all in the same place.</div></div><hr />

Someone wasn't around for Vanilla's launch where WoW was at 1 million before 2005 and the team constantly had to deal with load issues. Classic's launch is actually 1000x better than Vanilla's launch. The layering tech reduces the numbers more to what 2004's servers could do, for this exact reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the realm I was on, Ashkandi, said it was High with no queue and you could feel the delays and such. Looting took an additional 3-8 seconds at time. Sometimes spells didn't register correctly and was having to spam them. This was all in Northshire I believe, whatever Human starting area was. So that might have some things to do with it. I'd imagine if you are in other parts of the world that isn't starter areas it might be less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are very easy ways to get people to swap.<br />
<br />
Free server transfers, and if necessary give people who transfer (and lock themselves to the destination realm for X days) 3-4-5 days gametime.</div></div><hr />

You have to remember it's intentional. They are judging numbers based on what will be active consistently. Not the people who rush the first month of launch and then quit. They want to have as few realms as possible because it would lead to less people being spread out. The problem is, all the people logging in for the month are causing load time issues for everyone. So when things die down it could kill some servers off and make them dead, which isn't their goal.<br />

Yeah, but I highly doubt there's a max limit of layers they can add to the server. They should've started with more layers if this was the case, &quot;recreating&quot; the full vanilla experience isn't ideal if you want to keep your playerbase. I'm glad someone stepped up in the dev team to add a lot more layers to the realms, it was badly needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and no I'd suppose. I'm not sure what the max limit would be or how close they are to it. You'd be surprised by all the &quot;need authentic classic experience&quot; which probably lead to current launch situation. I know on PvP servers they are probably carefully gauging capacity because if you get too many people in an area with PvP it could cause server issues. No where near as bad as 40v40 on Live, but still.<br />
<br />
Ultimately I'm sure a lot of conversations happened about how to launch and this was the better of the scenarios in order to ensure healthiness over time. Sure it sucked for everyone, but maybe it was the best case scenario?</div></div><hr />

Thing that's really depressing people keep saying why create a character on a full server<br />
trouble is loads of people followed the advice and picked a low or newly added server. all the servers in the EU<br />
are now full. <br />
<br />
given the promotion about reserving a name think once a server reached max level they should have locked it<br />
happened many times in the past, People seem to be switiching servers at the moment hoping to transfer at a later date<br />
and its just making the situtation even worse</div></div><hr />

But this isn't the same as sharding, is it? Saw that rumor go around but afaik they use server capacity and sharding separately because they're separate features.<br />
<br />
Unsure if someone answered yet but from what I understand they’re two separate features. Sharding separates the players on each server into they’re own “phases”. They’re still on the same server they just can’t see each other if they’re sharded whereas opening new servers separates people completely. <br />
<br />
Realistically they could stop sharding and everyone on your server would see each other not counting things like Warmode. Same goes for layering, when they remove it everyone on 1 server will see each other as opposed to only people on each of the 4-5 layers seeing each other.</div></div><hr />

The rainbow flag has nothing to do with it, but a layer cake does. I've got one that describes your post pretty well too, hold on...<br />

Totally agree. The game where you level 1-60 in 3-6 months and don't care about being 60. Since Vanilla is all about the journey, not the destination.<br />
That without having the bad feeling/pressure of not being up to date with the artifact power level.<br />
<br />
I wonder what the situation will be in 2 months from now. I hope it will be the same case as it was with OSRS, when OSRS has become the main game :)</div></div><hr />

Quit in a month? I'd say Classic will become the more popular version of the game. I mean it already has. Classic is what is finally going to kill retail and that's good for all of us. It'll force Blizzard to make quality games again before BFA is far from a quality product. The queue times are temporary. Queues happen on retail too on servers like Illidan, but I doubt you knew that. Just the fact that there are hours and hours of queue times for a 15 year old version of the game speaks for itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If retail is going to kill retail, it means peoplewon't leaveit,which means queue will only get worse one layering is removed in phase 2.<br />
Hours of queue time can happen simply because max capacity is too low, login servers are set to filter people so it doesn't crash, etc.<br />
<br />
Not saying there's nobody on Classic, but you can't judge a game simply because it has queues.</div></div><hr />

....<br />
<br />
Everything in that post is exactly why retail is the way it is, and everything in it is what Vanilla did not, and what classic should not have. Why that even needs to be explained when the goal of classic was to give close to legitimate experience of how things were back then, is astounding. <br />
<br />
No, the feel of ~4000 people is not quite the same as 450k people layered at complete random at all times, matching retail in how you'll likely never see same players again. I think I know which ones have been the private server heroes here. Hint: people such as yourself who after years of grinding P servers, keep demanding this sort of extreme qol changes. This is supposed to be wow classic. Not exact vanilla, but most definitely not wow lvl 60 retail edition either.</div></div><hr />

You missed the point. I wasn't saying the queue time should never go up, that is bound to happen with any estimation. I am saying the actual number in queue goes up some times. Like I may be position 1538, and a couple of minutes later 1541.</div></div><hr />
