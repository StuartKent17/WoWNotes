Don't understand devs' love for players standing still. Movement is fun.<br />
So is caring about the specialness of movement, and the gameplay value of it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487760088795336705))<br />

What's the intent with new blood 4pc? Blood shield can't deplete, so immune to physical damage for 10sec?<br />
Your Shield can't drop below X% of your health; ie, every hit on you, Blood Shield will at least absorb that much. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487755376087953408))<br />

SI really gone for balance? Barkskin is so weak in comparison even with a 30second cd<br />
Barkskin is generally regarded as stronger, especially in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487748990486601729))<br />
I get killed with barkskin up almost every time I queue. And SI would help a lot more in raids since druids have no immunity<br />
With the Barkskin glyph? It's extremely strong in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487750293740740608))<br />

Are you even considering changing the new MM mastery? .. I would like to PVP as MM .. dont ruin my spec please<br />
I'm not sure how that ruins your spec. It's valuable for PvP, situationally (and is optional anyway). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487750513484517376))<br />
stand still in PVP, hunters need to kite all the time, or else we get instat wrecked. It never goes off in PVP<br />
You should try harder to get some stand-still time in. It is absolutely possible. You only have to stop for 3 sec. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487754545053724672))<br />
only hunter def is roar of sacri, and one talent row. That is no where near other classes. You cannot face tank melee or casters<br />
And Deterrence, and Disengage, and the other defensive talent row, and traps... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487758624622538752))<br />

yes, thanks for reply. Speaking about heating up fade on none crit hit. The grace delay was a good fix 1/2<br />
We feel like the grace delay worked well. It may need some slight retuning after the responsiveness fix, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487745674939609088))<br />

And in the category of nearly mandatory talents: Spirit Shell at Level 75. http://t.co/s5xP9BnOGs<br />
We think that's an interesting choice because Spirit Shell is not necessarily a throughput gain, whereas the others are. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487743120231002112))<br />

MM, ele and arms masteries changed for being too similar to MS. Why not combat?<br />
Combat's Mastery we changed to offhand dmg; has interaction with your other abilities. We decided it was different enough. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487742712121024512))<br />

Is the Echo of the Elements ui notification final? Looks like it's hard to see and not as flashy as Lava Surge &amp; Fulmination.<br />
No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487686965265850369))<br />
<br />
I know it's MOLTEN earth, but sounds like it should be nature damage.<br />
Nature is heavily overloaded, unfortunately. Rocks/Earth doing damage are typical physical, and we didn't want this to be ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487746660965949441))<br />
...affected by armor, or weirdly bypass armor.&quot;Nature&quot; damage is crazy. Poison, Solar, Plants, Lightning, Earth, Wind, Chi, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487747190345834497))<br />
<br />
Minor Glyph to make Molten Earth for Shamans summon Pandaria Earth Spirits.<br />
It doesn't summon anything. Heard that misconception several times now, perhaps there's a better way to word the tooltip. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487744138368929794))<br />
&quot;incite the earth around to come to their aid&quot; Since shamans call Elementals for aid, &quot;incite&quot; sounds like the earth comes alive<br />
In a way, it does, but they're not units, they're missiles. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487745178061398016))<br />
is this the same stone missiles the ogre shamans use in frost fire ridge?<br />
Very similar, but more polished for players. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487747563978637312))<br />
<br />
about new Ele mastery, will CL last target be the one you cast or the random one hit by the last chain?<br />
First target. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487760587409985537))<br />
<br />
Did the cool lightning from sky visual effect got scrapped for ele shammies? ;(<br />
I reckon that that was not the last you'll see of that visual. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487781930956365824))<br />
<br />
Any chance LB for EnhShaman will be revisited? Or is hardcasting LB as melee (to avoid MW overcapping) part of our skillcap?<br />
Part of your skillcap. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487845735056941056))<br />

Any chance you'll ever take WS off the GCD? Fury still feels terrible as is.<br />
It'd feel worse with WS off the GCD. You'd have a *ton* of rotational deadtime. Would feel extremely slow. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487748011133382657))<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanks now take 25% additional damage while engaged in PvP combat.&quot; Does this count Protection warriors in Glad stance too.<br />
Currently, no. It's something we could do if needbe, but don't think it's needed currently. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487754848180264960))<br />
<br />
...2 RB, bloodsurge proc, and full rage, no matter what we do feels wrong. Rage capping, wasting RBs and letting enrage fall...<br />
In that case, you should be doing WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-BR-RB-RB-BT. No lost rage, or RBs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487749999451582464))<br />
Did BT get a massive nerf/change in your build? You really prioritize it last? Dump to 0 rage / 0 RB before you BT...<br />
During a CS? Absolutely. It's the lowest DPCT. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487755497089425408))<br />
<br />
does Sudden Death's Execute proc increase based on rage or will it be as if we had minimum rage?<br />
Currently, yes. Strongly suspicious that that's too strong, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487756370083450880))<br />
<br />
Prot Warriors can continue to avoid/block while in Bladestorm dispite the tooltip removing that description. intended?<br />
Yes. That wording was removed from several tooltips to make them more understandable. No functional change. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487846269574868992))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Will Yrel have a custom, unique model like Jaina,Vol'jin etc or will she use a heavily modified version of new Draenei female?<br />
Yrel's model has a couple custom elements, but isn't a whole unique model like Velen or Khadgar. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/487673677400403968))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
color variation artists have made whenever you want, for a fee<br />
I love the idea of dying armor like Diablo did. I get a little worried with user-made content, because we're internet people. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487488224647184384))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
so you're fixing small details to the flag points that no one looks at when you could fix mmr and stop 0 point games<br />
The artist that made this flag post does not work on the MMR system (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487942602415546370))<br />
<br />
Could we get any information regarding the Tournament realm when it's coming up and so on or is it top secret?<br />
We're finalizing details to share. Sorry for the delay. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487717957808566272))<br />
<br />
Does the damage against Tanks stack higher if they are carrying a flag In a Normal or Rated BG?.<br />
The damage debuff for flag carrying remains the same so they'll stack (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/487775294510481409))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Do Garrisons have specific music? Would be awesome; for example variation of vanilla Orgrimmar music.<br />
They have their own music, but you can get a boom box that lets you change the music (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/488014619647418368))<br />

You should try harder to get some stand-still time in. It is absolutely possible. You only have to stop for 3 sec. (Celestalon)<br />
I am mostly oblivious to the world of PvP and yet I do find it absolutely ridiculous to think that almost certainly Cluelesstalon wrote it with straight face and firm belief in his anencephalic head that this is the way to handle PvP as a hunter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...2 RB, bloodsurge proc, and full rage, no matter what we do feels wrong. Rage capping, wasting RBs and letting enrage fall...<br />
In that case, you should be doing WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-WS-BR-RB-RB-BT. No lost rage, or RBs. (Celestalon)<br />
Truly wonderful rotation, isn't it? One button until you start puking, then a bit of weaving with other 3. End of the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love the idea of dying armor like Diablo did. I get a little worried with user-made content, because we're internet people. (Muffinus) To be more specific, dear Muffinus, you simply actually know just how pathetically you suck at design and that with any more flexibility to xmog your &quot;art&quot; would gradually cease to be even mentioned between playerbase.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it realistic to expect we will frequently switch gemming and enchanting, esp given stat attunements?<br />
The average player? Maybe not. A top 10 guild tank doing progression? Wouldn't surprise me at all. (WatcherDev)<br />
Maybe you won't have to switch gemming and enchanting as an average player, after all you can just do what you always did and keep 2 full gear sets. Now check how much blizzshit was excused with that whole &quot;but you will now have adaptive gear&quot; schtick.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With most ench/gem/reforg gone, how do we promote build diversity aside for drop RnG. It's fairly important during progression.But enchanting and gemming aren't gone? Also flask/food is a good chunk of secondary stats - you can make large stat adjustments. (WatcherDev) Yeah, around 5-7%. I almost crap myself every time I eat the noodles or gulp a flask in 562 gear. Possibly will need a diaper to play 6.0.<br />

<br />
&quot;So is caring about the specialness of movement, and the gameplay value of it. (Celestalon)&quot; &lt;- This has absolutely nothing to do with the amount of movement, except that there is more value if you can use your ability to move as a part of the gameplay.<br />
<br />
Like I've said before, love art stuff, I love Draenor, it's just awesome. But the class stuff is so very uneven this time. For example, at the same time as we see the birth of a really cool new mastery for Ele shaman, the movement cutoff not only makes it less fun to play but also risks creating even more burst problems just to make up for not being able to consistently shoot lightning bolts in pvp.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: &quot;So is caring about the specialness of movement, and the gameplay value of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Specialness of movement? Explain that to shadow priests; if you stop moving for one second then you die, and if you keep moving then you do next to no damage. There's no strategic &quot;gameplay value&quot; decision to be made in an arena setting - you run around like a headless chook trying to conserve your one and only &quot;oh shit&quot; button while your partner bludgeons your attackers to death. Not fun.<br />
<br />
Come WoD and all casters will be in the same boat but that's okay in Blizzard's eyes.<br />
<br />

I recently noticed Holy Avenger no longer uses the Ashbringer model for your weapon. Bug or intended? I always loved the model.<br />
Intended, for lore reasons. (Celestalon)<br />
However, Seraphim does give you a really sweet-looking custom 2H hammer, or 1H hammer and shield. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
Yup, i recalled the same thing. I guess &quot;for lore reasons&quot; now means &quot;because we're putting it on another ability&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just glad it's back, i always liked the visual effect of Holy Avenger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played several classes, mostly melee, and always felt bad for shadow priests who could literally do nothing against me.<br />
<br />
How is it fair that a melee can DPS on the move but a caster can't? Sure casters shouldn't be able unleash their full burst whilst on the move but to be prevented from doing anything while sustaining heavy damage from a melee attacker at the same time?<br />
<br />
If a caster manages to create distance between himself and a melee attacker, who should be rewarded, and who should be punished? Because before I left the game, it was the melee who got rewarded with multiple gap-closers, ranged interrupts, and the like. I hear that they're addressing these in WoD but how long will it be before players start crying to have all of that utility returned?</div></div><hr />

How is it fair that casters can DPS at distance while melee can do nothing ?<br />
<br />
Different style mean different strength and weakness. Caster dpsing while moving meant no weakness at all. Caster skill is to avoid melee and do damage. Melee skill is to avoid distance and do damage. Plain simple actually.</div></div><hr />
