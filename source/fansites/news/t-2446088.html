I'm not a fan of hyperbole or panicky nerd bullshit, but... er... yeah that's pretty much what happened, damn.<br />
<br />
I mean, they go ahead put Diablo up as the second thing after the opening ceremony and it's a mobile game. Christ. Not even a good-looking or vaguely original mobile game, like an actual D2 sequel. Just a dumbed-down D3.</div></div><hr />

It puts food on their table, but as someone who has a creative aspect to their work, to know, from the moment you sign the contract, that your piece of art will be ripped apart for the stigma that is glued to its genre (and rightfully so) no matter how good a job you do? I couldn't do that.</div></div><hr />

Just putting Diablo III on smart devices seems like a recipe for disappointment, though. It's going to be sluggish to play and the balance will have to be designed around that. I'm incredibly bummed that the development of a project like this wasn't focused on another D3 expansion instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, and this is why they don't even make very much money. They're just not a good model of a game for a small touchscreen. And everything about this one make it look not only fairly typical of the breed, but like it's just a pathetic spin-off from D3, rather than it's own thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am thinking something like this aswell. Since they have been hiring a lot of people for a unanounced diablo project. This game was made by another company. They wouldn't hire a lot of people for this</div></div><hr />

Maybe it’ll play decently on the 12.9” iPad Pro, but that’s a niche device. I highly doubt an action RPG would be any fun to play on the relatively small phone screens with touch control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard, &quot;We feel like we put in our time developing new and immersive content ... and to be quite frank, we're a bit tired after all these years so we think we'll just sit back and milk our past successes now&quot;. <br />

What a load of garbage. At least I got to enjoy the good years.<br />

First blizzard title to not make back the investment costs. At least I hope, cos that would be the wake-up-call they sorely need, holy shit.<br />

Not to sure. While I can wholeheartedly say I wont (since I haven't played any mobile game ever), I think it is still a big market. They might get a lot of people to download it, and the usual suspects to sink a few hundred bucks into it. But thats just my guess.</div></div><hr />

Full respect to the guy how actually asked if it's an April fools joke.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how this game is going to work.<br />
<br />
Who is going to play this?<br />
Phone batteries aren't going to last long for it.<br />
Who is going to sit at home and play it when you could play on a proper console or PC.<br />
Controls on phones are always bad for games like this.<br />
They mentioned connection issues themselves on the panel.<br />
<br />
And looking at the panel itself it looks like they don't even know what they're making. Like they're not even close to finished with this thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that line got me too. What are they gonna do with this newfound audience? The mobile market at large won't ever transition to PC gaming, so it can't be to broaden the fanbase for the next theoretical mainline Diablo game on PC. <br />
I can only conclude that from now on, every single Diablo game will be multiplatform, including mobile. This would be disastrous of course, as it would essentially mandate hamstringing the franchise's potential to maintain compatibility with the mobile platform.</div></div><hr />

I think this might go down as the biggest blunder in the history of the company. The Warcraft franchise can recover from Cata, WoD and BFA and Diablo recovered from D3 vanilla but whatever comes after this will need to be absolutely fucking stellar to make up for this.</div></div><hr />

Blizzards phone/tablet coverage on their two biggest/oldest IP's is nil. This was to be expected. At that Blizzard still needs more new IP's. The days when Blizzard was strictly a PC-based game company are pretty much over I think. There will still be some titles but coverage across platforms is going to be a priority for the next couple of years. PC gaming is not a priority for a lot of people any longer so multi-platform stuff is important for them to keep growing.<br />
<br />
I'd like a Diablo IV and a remastered Diablo II as much as anyone, especially the latter. I don't have any idea what they can do to separate a Diablo IV from II or III.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's the amazing thing. They contracted it out to Netease for appear to have literally re-used an existing engine, and pretty lazily too. And the assets seem to be basically D3 assets for the most part.</div></div><hr />

Yup. I imagine the PoE servers will be busier than usual for a bit after this, especially if the only other Diablo panel, which is right at the end of the con, doesn't at least strongly hint at D4.</div></div><hr />

Do you think that I bought my mobile phone to play Diablo on it? Do you think that right now the batteries of mobile phones are prepared for that? Are you for real?<br />

Amusing how people keep saying this, when it's not true. No, you do not need a smart phone to survive or thrive. Being in &quot;true contact&quot; means talking face to face. Sending emotes over whatsapp is not &quot;true contact&quot; no matter how hard you may wish so.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and how many of us play action-RPGs on our mobiles? This isn't even Blizzard-developed. This is Netease. So it will about as good as your average generic mobile action-RPG, which is to say: fucking terrible.<br />
<br />
There are a good mobile games. There are even good mobile games that require reflexes and so on. None of them are action-RPGs of the &quot;smash monsters&quot; kind.<br />
<br />
It's not even a big potential market, I'd say, because who is even going to play it? Some rando with a mobile? No. He'll be off-put by the branding and so on. Diablo fans? HAH. Old Diablo players? Nope. So I guess they're hoping the Asian market will switch from mobile MMOs designed specifically for that market to this? Yeah, I don't see anyone in Asia ditching L2 Revolution or whatever the latest thing in mobile MMOs is, for this.</div></div><hr />

It would have been really better this way, with a: &quot;Look we have more surprises coming in the future, but we're not ready to show them now, so, in the waiting time, we have Diablo Immortal&quot;, this is one of the ways they could have handled it, but unfortunately it was not the case :(.</div></div><hr />

You could always count on high quality games, sure they weren't perfect but they were always engaging, fun and polished. They're sacrificing their name and reputation for short term profits.

Its not even meant for PC, they said its only for Mobile. Its just a stupid Diablo 3 clone, downscale to fit a mobile. This is the worst Blizzcon to date, and I thought last year was bad..<br />
<br />
Diablo immortal is Blizzard biggest flopp ever. NCsoft got Lineage Eternal both for PC and mobile, and its a MMO. Howcome Blizzard which are a giant in the industry cant do the same thing?<br />

They aren't. They're for a PC game, you can tell because they explicitly call for experience with DX12.<br />
<br />
Also, the listings for this were for an &quot;unannounced mobile game&quot; and all dealt with mobile games, and implementing assets developed by third party vendors. The PC game listings are for an &quot;unannounced Diablo game.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I have a phone. I don't game on it. Diablo is a DESKTOP/CONSOLE franchise, not a cramped, ptw phone game. Snotty comments about having phones doesn't sell a game.
