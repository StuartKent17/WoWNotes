Also, all normal modes are getting nerfed (except Freya) and all hard modes are getting buffed. Including Algalon.<br />
I don't see anything to complain about. Lame guilds can see Ulduar fine. Good guilds will struggle being good.</div></div><hr />

Along with the situation with Hodir (buffed to impossibility after Method+Inner Sanctum killed him, then Ensidia killed him using an exploit that Blizzard then removed), I would be pretty pissed off if I were in a top 100 guild that wasn't one of those three.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the hard mode race, better to overtune and then nerf, rather than the other way around. Ah well, this is Blizzard's first time through with the hard modes.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully this will give casuals and the wider WoW community a chance to experience the brilliantly designed instance while providing some sunwell like difficulty hard modes.<br />

Pretty much echos my thoughts.<br />

Ulduar is the new naxx for normal modes(8 sec tantrum, seriously?), but hard modes are next to impossible for all but the best guilds.</div></div><hr />

How'd you get Easy mode? There's only Normal and Hard. No matter how much they nerf Ulduar it will always be Normal mode. You can't exactly have Easy mode and Hard mode without a Normal mode.<br />

<br />
Ulduar still isn't naxx, all of the bosses need some coordination, whereas theres very few that need decent coordination or group splitting in naxx.. the bosses are new and interesting, the trash isnt lolaoenuke as it was before...<br />
<br />
Hardmode should be hardmode, and I like the fact it would be hard... too many people are thinking it should be doable by guilds with people in mostly naxx gear.. because what happens when everyone is in t8? The hardmodes will be easy and people will cry.</div></div><hr />

I just couldn&amp;#180;t agree more! people need to stop whining and just enjoy the game... If you think normal ulduar is too easy, do hard mode.. and if you think that&amp;#180;s too hard then you have nothing to complain about cause you have both options, go clear or work on progress!<br />

<br />
Seriously there are posters above who are complaining that the hardmodes are getting harder. What Blizz have done is give UD longevity. What they are basically saying is, once your raid is in full UD25 normal mode, you can come back and try the hardmodes. <br />
<br />
We're up to Thorim (sp?) and people in our guild are requesting to try hard modes. Blizz are telling them to stfu, go away and come back when you are full UD25 and even then you had better be good. Awesome if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

Like Iron assembly with middle guy last, Flame leviathon with a few but not all towers, Hodir in 6 mins, Freya with 1-2 adds etcetera.<br />
<br />
These medium modes should be concidered normal mode, then you have both easy and hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Gap between 'Easy mode' casual raids, and 'hardmode' hardcore raiders just got alot bigger, we knew this was comming. expect Uld on normal mode 10/25 to be rather easy now, and Hard modes, to be next to impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
thats my thought.<br />
<br />
we tried XT hardmode in 10man last week und we got the heart down, but wiped soon after cause of trantum.<br />
we could've managed it if we had tried a little more but now with 40% (last week was 25%) its absolutly HARD ;)<br />
now its only 8 seconds but nevertheless its harder.<br />
<br />
i dont complain that its too hard, but normal mode is now laughable, when you can survive the trantum</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arath</div><div class="date">2009-05-01, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As was mentioned the problem is that now the gap between normal and hard has increased exponentially, to be closer to very easy and extremely difficult. Furthermore, many guilds cannot attempt hard modes because it requires a certain level of gear which has to be farmed from Ulduar first, rather than skill and coordination which was something (I personally) found was what was so great about the pre-nerf encounters.<br />
<br />
And on a side note if you hit more than one mine you would get one shot since the mines next to those also exploded. Can't say I am pleased about these changes, I was very happy with the encounters and thought the first wave of nerfs was fine.</div></div><hr />

You need to go back and re-read what Blizzard said. They said it was going to be harder than Naxx. It is. They said it wasn't going to be 'that much' harder than Naxx. Turned out the difficulty differential was higher than they wanted, so they changed it to be like they said. Anyone saying that Ulduar, even post-nerfs, is as easy as Naxx is on crack. My old 25 man cleared Naxx in 3 raids the first time we went in, and nobody had been in Naxx60. There were about 3 fights in Naxx that required any kind of L2Move/coordination. If you're claiming that Ulduar has been made that easy then you're deluded. It's more difficult, it's just not a step up from Naxx to SWP level difficulty. If you want that step up, farm the 'ezmode' for a few weeks and then try Hard Modes. Or, as an earlier poster pointed out, there are plenty of medium modes for you to try.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have done exactly what they said they would, and they've given everyone the option to push themselves based on their appetite for a challenge, and yet still the whiny little biatches on these forums are unsatisfied...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this is not going to be &quot;naxx&quot; easy it will still requires other type of strategy. This just makes it so that mistakes dont get punish as hard. Also remeber, your not going to get geared in 1 run. It will take weeks to get geared. do you really want that frustration every week. This still is going to require to move around and follow the strat but you wont get killed by a common mistake that you also need every 25 of the players to follow. Ex: Blue Fire from razorscale, you had to move the second it hit the ground if you didn't it would kill you almost instantaneously now it wont kill you as fast but you still have to get out or your just retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always considered myself hardcore, but I am not bothered by any of these changes at all. No matter your definition of 'casual', Blizzard ultimately just wants everyone to have fun, and see some of the cooler aspects of the game. (The tram in Mimirons area is superb) This makes the instance have a little room for error, albeit very slight, and the players who raid a few nights a week at most will get to see it all. This is also a step up from Naxx in every way possible. The margin for error is reduced and the coordination for the fights are more intense.<br />
<br />
Bump up those hard modes and the 'elite' get to have their asses handed to them Sunwell/Pre-BC Naxx/AQ40 -like. Do they get rewarded for their efforts? Higher iLevel gear, achievements for bragging rights, the right to a new mount, and an insanely hard boss (Algalon). I would say that's keeping the players happy. If you go to any of the top raiding guilds out there's website, you will notice they say the same thing. Hard mode is HARD! With a big smile on their face.<br />
<br />
This whole 10/25 man thing is new to the game via 3.0. Blizzard is going to tweak and fix anything they can, simply to balance as far as they can go with it. Will Icecrown be 'easy'? Most likely the first half will be doable in the first week for any skill level, but they won't get as many nerfs now that Blizzard is watching for this stuff. Will the 'hard' modes be hard? You can bet your ass they will be.<br />

<br />
So what do you have for your average top 5 guild on your server. Clearing content that constantly gets nerfed while having no shot at getting to Alagon because of the buffs. If Ensidia cant do it, neither can your average top5 server guild. <br />
<br />
So these players, albeit only a few of them, are stuck in somewhat of a limbo, not being able to progress to Alagon but also 1-2shotting most bosses in Ulduar. Even Sunwell pre-nerf no top guild came out and said it was &quot;impossible&quot; like we saw with i think it was Hodir hard mode? This should tell you something. Clearly its over tuned.<br />
<br />
What im thinking is, make hardmodes at least possible for guilds like Ensidia then you can nerf normal mode to hell, so good guilds can have a shot at progression, even if it is slow.<br />

Blizzard fails to see that hard modes are same bosses with few new abilities, or just increased hp/dmg, NOT new bosses. And if they wanted to make Ulduar more casual friendly they could have nerfed only 10m version.</div></div><hr />

I think they're being too kneejerk with these nerfs, some of the thrash which required you to have pull tactics is already back to the roundemup and aoe again. Hmm maybe we should have hardmode trash also to keep everybody happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think this is a primary example of our playerbase...<br />
<br />
The odds are that this guy hasnt even cleared ulduar, let alone the hard-modes to see algalon.<br />
<br />
So to put it bluntly, why the fuck do people like you even have an opinion on the subject?<br />
<br />
It bring me back to the eyonix posts when 3.1 was released and shortly after...<br />
<br />
People just like to jump on the QQ bandwagon, no matter what it's about or whether they have any experience with it at all.<br />
<br />
The people who will be most pissed off by the nerf will be the guilds, like mine, who are in the middle of ulduar progression and wanted to keep the challenge.<br />
<br />
I suppose it's a case of 'whatif' When we do get to our progression kill on boss X, we'll end up thinking to ourselves.. would we have done it pre-nerfs?<br />
<br />
The progression kill is what people care about, not the farming... farming is farming. Hard modes are looking to be the next progression kills, despite being the same bosses, as they havent been done before in that way. <br />
<br />
Would you say that OS+3D was shit because it was just the same as OS+0D except with more spells?<br />
<br />
As I said earlier.. if people are doing hard-modes in mostly noxxromulus gear, then when people are fully ulduar geared it will be just too easy and people will whine &quot;ZOMG BLIZZARD I THOGUHT HARDMODES WERE HARD, WE AMS ONE SHOTTING THEM, YOU ARE FAIL!!!!!1111&quot;<br />

Second there is a huge point that u have to know about wow, u have to find your place in the game where u fit into. Back in the day near the end of Vanilla wow u had 4 tiers where u could easy find your place, U had to advance through all of them most of the time to get to your Max potentional. If you could not handle AQ40 for example then u wore stuck @ BWL and below, same went for naxx and even BWL. <br />
Exact the same thing should apply in WOTLK where u have to find your own place in the game. If u suck then u should not raid basicly or u will be stuck in the begining. If u are avrage player with avrage skill then u shuold be able to clear the isntance on normal mode In time. And if u are exceptional player u Should be able to clear hardmodes in Time.<br />
Time is the thing that ppl today dont seams to care about, they want to go from A to Y without passing through the entire Alphabet in steps that should be done. You Advance though the Game nothing else.<br />
My end point be, If u suck then u should NOT be able to do hard modes just because u suck thats it. If u want to become a better player fight for it and u might will be and u can Advance through the game as u wore supposed to. I find it Good that Blizzard buffs the Hard modes because that seperates the sissies from the real Pro players. To All players, If u want to do hard modes then u Have to advance though them, U cant jump over skill, gear and strategies you Have to advance though All of them!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to address arguments from a both sides because quite frankly, you're ALL acting immaturely and more importantly, you're making poor and invalid points. <br />
<br />
The Difficulty<br />
Ulduar was designed to be &quot;Harder than Naxx.&quot; Please read that statement again carefully. If you can't read back I will post it again, Ulduar was designed to be &quot;Harder than Naxx.&quot; What this means is that on a difficulty scale from 1-10 (1 being easy and 10 being Stupid Hard) Ulduar was designed to score higher than whatever score Naxx had. So, for example if Naxx was a 3 this means that Ulduar will be higher than a 3. This does not mean that Ulduar will be a 10, it simply means that the difficulty from Naxx to Ulduar has been upped. Simply because you feel it isn't hard enough is irrelevant. It IS harder, and Blizzard DID fulfill their promise. <br />
<br />
PUGs<br />
After reading about the nerfs, I've seen post after post of people lamenting the &quot;fact&quot; that Ulduar will now be pugable by anyone and their dog, and epic lootz will fall upon players like a light spring rain. Please tell me then, good sirs, of the successes that PUGs are having on your servers. Please describe to me the downing after downing of bosses by a cobbled together group of often vent-less, DBM-lacking players. Please tell me you see in Trade Channel advertisements for PUGs asking for &quot;two more healers, 25 man PUG Ulduar on Mimiron can summon&quot; or even &quot;need one more tank for Thorim, PST.&quot; Have you? I haven't. I haven't heard of anyone else who has either. You're simply making this up under an assumption based on the simple fact that these new numbers are smaller than the old numbers. On my own server (US Kel'Thuzad) I have seen only ONE PUG group advertised weekly, and that was for nothing more than a quick 25 man Flame Leviathan kill for loot. I have not heard of or seen a 25 man group farther than that. Your baseless claims are not helping your argument. Come back with supporting evidence or don't come back at all. <br />
<br />
(PS. Please note I'm only speaking about 25 mans here, I have seen 10 man PUGs running but since I do not know how far they get on average I cannot comment on them) <br />
<br />
&quot;Go do Hard Mode lol&quot;<br />
Go away. In the interest of politeness I think I will be a bit more detailed: Please go away. I have no proof, but I am fairly positive that these comments are all coming from players who have either never seen these bosses in Ulduar they're talking about, have ever even read what they're like on Hard Mode, or both. But in the interest of fairness, fine, let's &quot;go do hard mode.&quot; Let's take a look at Hodir, shall we? Hodir Hard Mode requires an average of 12,000 DPS from every single player to do it. This is also if you only take in ONE tank and TWO healers. Have you done Hodir? Have you seen the healing required? Have you seen the movement that is required on the DPS? Do you honestly believe that T8 will allow that kind of DPS from your classes even with hard effort? Ensidia just recently killed Hodir Hard mode and the only way they did it was by a glitch/work-around and even WITH the help of this glitch (quickly hot-fixed) they were .03 seconds away from not getting it. <br />
&quot;Go do hard mode?&quot; No. You don't know what you're talking about. Go do your own &quot;hard mode&quot; by going away and not coming back until you have something constructive. <br />
<br />
The Nerfs<br />
This is a tough issue because there are no doubt things we're not considering. Take, for example, the difficulty change of Naxx10 to Ulduar10. Now, when I went with my guild to rest run Ulduar10 we didn't have any difficulty with the few (non-bugged at the time) fights. Keep in mind, we were also BiS Naxx25, which makes quite a difference. For those coming into Ulduar10 with Naxx10 gear, the steep damage, dps and healing requirements might be a little too much. With that in mind, I can easily understand and agree with the nerfs done to the bosses in the 10 man content. HOWEVER I think I find myself in agreement with most of my other raiders here that the nerfs to the 25 man content are unwarranted. Razorscale isn't difficult because his fire hurt badly, he is difficult because people stand in it. XT's isn't hard because his enrage timer is too short or his Light bomb radius is too large, he is hard because your DPS isn't doing their job stopping the bots from repairing him or stupid people aren't running away when they get the bomb. Kologran isn't hard because his eyebeams hit for a lot, he's hard because morons don't move away from it. Mimiron isn't hard because....okay actually I take that back, Mimiron is actually kind of a pain in the ass. :-X <br />
But you get my point. The difficulty of these bosses is not relative to the damage they do or the healing they require, these bosses are all difficult because the level of coordination their mechanics demand is beyond that of the casual or really crappy player. I'm sorry Blizzard. I know you work hard on this content and want everyone to see the hard work and effort your creative staff have put into it, but I think I speak for many of the other player base when I say that 1.5k DPS rogues who stand in fire...honestly don't deserve to see it. <br />
<br />
That took longer than I thought. /endrant :-X</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I think what drives a lot of the QQ here is that difficulty is terribly subjective.<br />
<br />
Clearly, Blizzard intended on there being a clear path of 'progression' of sorts for the normals, but the problem is that it's all been muddled by how damned easy Naxx 25 was.<br />
<br />
If it's Blizzard's intention to have a clear Naxx 10 -&gt; Uld 10 progression path, which it clearly is, the problem is that people who did regular PUG runs of Naxx 25 and have mostly item level 213 gear will be able to just roll into Uld 10 and probably get all the way to Mimiron before they actually hit a challenge. And since most of their gear will be 213, not 226, most of the Uld10 gear will be minor upgrades to let them push into Uld25.<br />
<br />
I don't know how I feel about that. Sure, it'll open options for my tankadin alt who is in mostly 213 gear with a smattering of 200 gear here and there but I was up to Uld10 Mimiron on my tankadin in this gear anyway.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the nerfs to Normal Uld 25 are unjustified. Those encounters are easily doable for 25 man raid groups wearing full 25 man Naxx gear. So the progression is already there and solid. <br />
<br />
Finding 25 people to do a PUG run has never really been a 'challenge', regardless what Zharym says. And even if post-nerf 25 Ulduar PUGs hit a brick wall around Iron Council or Hodir, that's still a fair amount of loot upgrades per week. 25 is fine as it is, imo. It's 10, alone, that's way overtuned. By nerfing both, it just ensures that 25 Normal Ulduar will end up being mostly PUGable once people are decked out in 219 gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lets consider normal raid comp<br />
<br />
Emalon prenerf = 750k adds down to 520k<br />
(2 tank, 5 heals, 18 dps)<br />
<br />
dps needed is down from 37k/sec to 26k/sec<br />
<br />
37/18 = 2k dps, while 26/18 = 1.5k dps<br />
<br />
2k dps per dpser is already so easy (since people in full naxx is gonna do 3.5k easily), why nerfed it to 1.5k ? 1.5k dps is the dps of people fresh from heroic instances who doesnt bother to gather t7/7.5 and get t8.5, WTF?<br />
<br />
XT-002 , TT unhealed = wipe down to TT + judgement of light = full health?<br />
<br />
Auriaya,<br />
<br />
50% damage boost per cat down to 30%<br />
<br />
pound doing 15k damage + 100% boost which is 30k damage (2 adds per OT)<br />
down to<br />
<br />
15+60% which is just 25k<br />
<br />
the magic number of 25k damage is basically, a tank in perfect blues+greens with raid buff...<br />
<br />
30k damage being so low already and now tanks in &quot;perfect&quot; blues can tank uld25.. wow ? this is the so called &quot;hard&quot; uld?<br />
<br />
if u want me to go down the list i will but i guess this gives the general idea of just how much the nerf is..<br />
<br />
XT-002 which is the 1st DPS+healer test if u even qualify in ULD has its hp nerfed, auriaya which is the 1st tank test is also nerfed...<br />
<br />
this is really a joke.. i can understand why they choose those 2, though, maybe its just that bliz want people to at least see the 4 keepers since they arent optional bosses.. but seriusly? why nerfed the keepers now?<br />
<br />
and dont forget about how the world's 1st killl of yogg is within 24 hrs of 3.1 launch<br />
<br />
my only hope is that blizzard buff up at least those 4 keepers cos they are nth but a joke ,except mimi which is quite a challenge for healers watching grid and more than 5 stupid ways to get 1 shotted...<br />
<br />
I really , really, really , ...................., really hope that &quot;scrubs&quot; will never see vezax nor yoggy , until they decide to at least gear up in naxx, which most of us do when we get to enjoy prenerf uld<br />
<br />
Its really a shame that those booses has become the next naxx...<br />
<br />
and i still can hardly believe.. when i see scrubs wearing t8.5 alongside with &quot;legenday blues&quot; and &quot;epic greens&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Lamer is a jargon or slang name originally applied in cracker and phreaker culture to someone who didn't really understand what he or she was doing. Today it is also loosely applied by IRC, BBS, and online gaming users to anyone perceived to be contemptible. In general, the term has come to describe someone who is intentionally ignorant of how things work.&quot;<br />
<br />
There you go. I'm not in a good guild. We have like 15 awesome players which obviously isn't enough to pull a good enough 25man. The others are lamers. I consider myself average.<br />

Is it really going to ruin your day? Are you going to lose any sleep over it? Until you start paying a &quot;premium&quot; subscription fee, don't expect to have access to any &quot;exclusive&quot; content. So what if some crappy Rogue only dishes out 1500 DPS and dies to void zones? He's obviously not going to get as far as someone in an organised guild, but by no means should be be restricted from seeing the content he's paid for.<br />
<br />
I swear the only way people will ever be happy is if Blizzard starts charging an additional $10 per month to zone into raids.</div></div><hr />
