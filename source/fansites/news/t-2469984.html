Hello Classic enthusiasts! We’ve been following the discussions about Classic closely here on the forums (and elsewhere) throughout the winter, and wanted to give you an update on a few things that the Classic development team has worked through since BlizzCon and the Classic demo.<br />
<br />
The feedback we got from the demo was fantastic. Thank you to everyone who gave us so much feedback to work with, especially the community members who compiled lists of issues that people found with the demo. We’ve looked at everything that was reported, and want to share a few anecdotes with you so you can see how we’re tackling these issues.<br />
<br />
One thing many players noticed was the incorrect health regeneration and the spell critical hit multiplier. Good catch! Going into the demo, we thought we’d fixed that and were surprised to see the issue crop up. Before BlizzCon, we specifically checked health and mana regeneration, and fixed the critical hit cases. We also did combat and regeneration tests to make sure we had those accurate.<br />
<br />
It turns out that there was a discrepancy between how Classic was configured on our environment at the office (correct!) and the environment serving the demo to you (not correct…). Tracking that down taught us how to best check our environment configuration as we prepare it for launch.<br />
<br />
Another issue players reported was that Warlock demon summoning was broken – lots of players said that you shouldn’t lose your current demon until the new one appears. We double-checked and in the original 1.12 WoW, and there, as soon as you started summoning a new demon, your existing demon disappeared. So the demo actually matched how the game played originally. There were a few other reports – such as “rare mobs do way less damage” and “Kobolds at Jangolode Mine run faster than walking speed when running away” – where we were able to confirm that the gameplay was the same in the demo as in the original 1.12 WoW.<br />
<br />
It’s important to point out that there are some bugs we’re going to fix before launch, and there are some bugs that we don’t intend to address. As we mentioned in our BlizzCon presentation, some differences aren’t worth fixing, like differences in how the mail works. Nonetheless, we’ve fixed some fairly high-priority issues:<br />
<br />
<br />
Critical Strike rating: Each item now “Improves your chance to get a critical strike by X%.”<br />
Rogue Energy didn’t work right: it was both benefiting from melee haste and re-calculating more often than it was supposed to. Both issues were fixed.<br />
Slow Fall no longer applies to your jumps.<br />
You again get pushback when hit by ranged attacks and wands.<br />
Dodge, Parry, and Miss were all not happening often enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
That’s not all we’ve done, of course, but we want to give you an idea of what we’re prioritizing: core game systems, combat, and content. We’ve spent time on other things such as user interface and making sure graphics “feel” like they used to, but our primary focus is on gameplay.<br />
<br />
Again, we’re following all of your discussions and loving your enthusiasm – and we’re going to get more information for you posted here soon (not soon™).<br />
<br />
Thank you, and get ready for a Classic Summer!</div></div><hr />

Correct. Think it was implemented in TBC if I had to guess. You can see the vanilla behavior in drakedogs pvp videos when he summons his infernal btw.</div></div><hr />

Genuine question, why do you want to shit on peoples' parade? It's just so petty. Let the people who got classic be happy, that it exists makes literally no difference to you. Classic isn't something I will bother with a lot either, but at least people get what they have been asking for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Because you forget the other side of it. They've already started asking for possible added content like more raids. If they fork WoW, everything after classic becomes null and void and the story is reset.....i dont want that. id rather there be no classic. i played it, i never want to go back lol plus MMOs should never bring back the past</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they do anything like that, I am 99% sure that the canon story will be standard WoW and if they add more content, it will have a different team from WoW and obviously it will be worth the cost for them to add it because it's profitable and new content wouldn't affect lore or development time. However I am doubtful they will add any new content because they've said they want to keep it as a museum or something.</div></div><hr />

People can ask all they want. If it happens cool, if it doesn't cool. Current WoW will still keep releasing expansions until it stops making money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For any game dev in general.<br />
<br />
Says a lot when my most hyped game of this year well a few are remakes and remasters. Like I'm more hyped for the CTR Remaster than anything related to Blizzard these days. Blizzard just lack passion and quite frankly most of the news as of late has been negative as hell with them.<br />
<br />
Only new games I guess I'm super hyped for are the FF14 and ESO expansions later this year.</div></div><hr />

it was too high by quite a lot. Basically it was using newer formulas. And it seems it's server side setup. <br />
<br />
And honestly, I don't care at all by how much it was wrong. However why it was wrong is more interesting to me.<br />

<br />
We have better odds of laughing at your salty amazon from them not forking WoW, than them forking it.<br />
<br />
I have NOTHING against Classic, or people playing it, but the amount of ego wrapped up in it now, along with the utterly unicorn level of wishful thinking attached to it is more entertaining than the actual reboot. These &quot;You'll see, you'll be SOWWWY!&quot; comments are hysterical enough, but actually thinking they'd stop development on the actual game to restart a whole new game based on a nostalgia ride? That's comedy right there. And using the fantasy to be smug and snarky at the unicorn payback coming? That deserves it's own HBO comedy special.</div></div><hr />

It's just so petty. Let the people who got classic be happy, that it exists makes literally no difference to you. Classic isn't something I will bother with a lot either, but at least people get what they have been asking for a long time.<br />
<br />
Probably because he was tired of hearing the &quot;OMG CLASSIC IS TEH BEST TING EVAR AND MODERN WOW IS TRASH&quot; thing that people have going on.<br />
<br />
Doesn't excuse him to act out like that, but I can understand why he spoke out.<br />
<br />
Personally, I hope classic is a success. Realistically, though, I struggle to see it succeeding in the long term. What made classic great was its community, and I'm not sure mechanics of any kind can bring that back.</div></div><hr />

Warlock, mage, and shadow priest (since it's the last patch of Classic). Also, a hunter will be an excellent tool for farming materials (use him as your mule).<br />

Level whatever you think you'll have more fun playing. If you level up for nostalgia reasons, most likely you'll quickly remember everything you hated about that class and will end up quitting or rerolling.<br />
<br />
I've played nelf priest in vanilla with druid and human warlock alts. In classic I'll be playing something else. Models will be slightly different, so I guess dwarves won't look as bad as they used to, so dwarf something is a possibility.</div></div><hr />

We’ve spent time on other things such as user interface and making sure graphics “feel” like they used to<br />

hate to be the bearer of bad news Blizzard, but when your prominent point in a seldom update involves even the mention of the simple interface from over 6 months ago, I have extremely low expectations for Classic and don't really want to participate in your bastardized interpretation of Classic.<br />
<br />
Based on this reply, it really does seem like you only just got around to fixing player feedback from a demo you held 6 months ago. It doesn't seem like you've made any significant progress considering your mention of the interface. fixing lists of issues is fine, but no list of issues is complete since the testing was confined to two relatively simple zones.<br />

Classic seems like it's going to be seriously flawed and broken at arrival. You've lost all consumer goodwill Blizzard, and this response to months of information requests isn't good enough.</div></div><hr />

Most people probably feel either like you, or they'll simply stick to one or the other without all the toxicity thrown around.<br />
It's just that when a certain server got shut down, the forums were overrun by people spewing bile everywhere, which naturally drew ire from the players enjoying the product being lambasted, which caused a still ongoing back and forth.<br />
<br />
In the end, Classic players will support the Live game financially even if they don't want to, and Live players will have access to double the content should they so please.<br />
<br />
It's a net Win for all, regardless of which version they favour on a personal level.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to play both - sssort of. My PvE fun is going to move over to Classic for sure. On retail I might still play PvP because of a friend of mine but unless I see much improvement over BfA: I'm not buying any future expansions. I'm just gonna use retail at that point to RP because that's the biggest reason I play WoW, but RPing every day isn't an option (which is why I need PvE stuff to do).</div></div><hr />

i would say more like 80% , with 95% being gone by the level 40 , especially if they will reduce regens compared to demo. <br />
<br />
its just slow unlayable piece of garbage compared to current gen of mmorpgs.<br />
<br />
but im sure a lot of people who lack skills to clear normal mode on retail will enjoy their game with bosses that have 1 mechanics and classes that use 2 buttons<br />

i feel only sad for people who never played vanilla and are expecting gd knows what due to magical stories told on forums by vanilla fans. <br />

IKR. Apparently spell pushback is actually still in the game on Live, but I can't remember the last time it ever affected me. Voids Elves are immune to pushback as a racial and I'm like what? I haven't experienced it since Wrath lol.<br />
<br />
Do you have your castbar somewhere in your eye resting area? My cast bar is right below my weakauras which are right below my character and I use the Gnosis addon for my castbar and when I get hit it shows how much time was added in the cast. The information isn't relevant to shit (as a pve'r at least) but it does happen.</div></div><hr />

I cant wait to see how many ppl that never played it, play it and complain it's too hard and want blizz to nerf shit. <br />
<br />
Are all the rogues ready to walk VERY slowly in stealth again? Druids too? What about crying that you didnt get any loot in the 40man raid you waited hours to fill for? <br />
<br />
Gonna be interesting!<br />
<br />
There are many possible reasons why the trend happened. For instance, we ran out of iconic villains like the lich king that had a whole previous game devoted to his development. Could also be that people get sick of playing the game game for years.</div></div><hr />

I am here. I love BfA and I think I'll love classic as well. My plan is to transition to classic, as I love its RPG theme, its consistent world, its slow pace, but I'll keep playing BfA for a while and probably next addon as well. May be I'll drop retail raiding if I would find classic raiding guild (but I think that it'll be pretty much impossible, so probably classic will accompany my retail raiding).<br />

I just can't decide on one thing.<br />
Should I level a nelf hunter as that was my first toon in vanilla, so for nostalgia reasons.<br />
Or should u level a human warrior, who was my first tank, for same reasons.<br />
Level hunter. I'm already leveling tank, no need for second.<br />

No, I think it meant that some of the bugs reported will not be addressed because they’re not bugs and the person was incorrect. They gave several examples of those.<br />

i feel very lonely here, as a player that not totally damn BfA and find some fun in retail and also is very happy to look forward to classic. in the last years i played one toon on horde, and one toon on alliance, per xpac, to experience story at both sides. maybe i switch to one horde char in classic (because i relatively dislike „new“ horde aka the plain bad guys and liked „thralls horde“ way more) and one alliance char in retail, in the future. seems fine to me.<br />
<br />
what i wanna say: why is everything so damn black/white here ? are there really that less ppl with enough differentation to get fun out of both products ? <br />
<br />
sad world...<br />
<br />
I'm really enjoying the raids in BFA but in summer, it will be post 8.1.5 and pre 8.2 so maybe my guild wont raid anymore... It will be impossible to raid in both games anyway, unless you dont do ANYTHING else (no &quot;life&quot;, no job, no other games)<br />
<br />
I'm playing hunter since vanilla... and I'm not sure I want to go back to vanilla hunter (dead zone, ammo, pets that can go away in the middle of a boss fight)</div></div><hr />

How many people will only play it a bit for nostalgia and then quit? Also we still have to see if people from back then will start playing again, as it wouldn't feel right to me, if nobody of my former guild mates will be back. Of cause most of us moved on in life and won't come back or might look at vanilla in a different way, once actually playing it again.<br />
<br />
Another thing is, that back in Vanilla we all were noobs and some of us did manage to learn the ropes faster than others. I out-dpsed most others easily back then, because many ignored hit, like our mages and warlocks were all Int+Crit, while I equipped my twink mage with spellpower+hit and out-dpsed all of them. Still remember the raid leader (mage) being like &quot;Look, I have finally reached 10k mana!&quot; like this would mean anything. Now it should be different, execept for the people not knowing about hit and spellpower, as both are gone from modern WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its just slow unlayable piece of garbage compared to current gen of mmorpgs.<br />
<br />
but im sure a lot of people who lack skills to clear normal mode on retail will enjoy their game with bosses that have 1 mechanics and classes that use 2 buttons<br />
<br />
i feel only sad for people who never played vanilla and are expecting gd knows what due to magical stories told on forums by vanilla fans. <br />
<br />
the dissapointment will be .... legendary if they are expecting even semi interesting product - instead couple of weeks of painful booring slow boring grindy boring grind to level up. <br />
<br />
i feel geniuinly sorry for those people .<br />
<br />
You have no idea how clueless that sounds. Its always easy to compare games in personal perspective and completely disregard how it works in practice.<br />
<br />
When you look at current mmorpgs to begin with, how many of them actually are good? isnt it a common theme that all new mmos die within a year or two at most. Ive only played 3-4 mmos, in the past 10 years, and the only one that still makes me want to resub at some point is WoW.<br />
<br />
You mistake &quot;boring grind&quot; to rewarding progression... if you LOOK at classic gameplay it may seem boring, but when you are actually doing it... you will get addicted to the progression you make and rewards you gain every once in a while, which do change your gameplay and give you more tools to play with.<br />
What is there on retail to keep players playing? what rewards do you get on retail? if all the answers are in endgame then the game is more boring than classic. Dont even get started on world quests... thats a boring grind if ive ever seen one, and it has no rewards either.<br />
<br />
Its not at all a magical story when people tell you how cool it is when you finally get shoulder armor... or when you finally get one of your hardest hitting abilities. (level 40+ talents, mortal strike etc. you also get new abilities throughout the journey from 10-40)<br />
Let alone getting that first epic item, because unlike retail on classic epics actually were rare before you enter the raids, blues were valuable... even greens depending on the item slot.<br />
<br />
Its how a progression should be made... BFA leveling is nowhere near as fun as you think it is.... what motivates you to keep going? endgame? well thats not part of the leveling its what you get when you are done with it, try again... new gear? leveling greens replacing your raid epics is cool? okay then, whatever floats your boat. But thats pretty much it... you get nothing from leveling in BFA content, infact if i remember right your character becomes weaker during it. <br />
Level 110 is stronger at killing mobs than 116... how can that be? thats hardly motivating.<br />
<br />
Now i could go on with being a classic fanboy but lets stick to the cold hard facts instead:<br />
-In classic you get 1 talent point every 2 levels along with new spell(s) and/or spell ranks. (gives you the direct control how you build your character. 1 point might not seem to make a big difference but it does if you keep your eyes peeled and its also as choice you make and not the game)<br />
-In retail you get new talent every 15 levels or something like that... in the latest expansion(s) you dont even get 15 levels so you maybe get 1 talent point.<br />
<br />
-In classic elite quests are impossible to solo, ofcourse there are rare cases but this is a general reality.<br />
-In retail elite quests dont even exist, or do they? i havent noticed since it doesnt make a difference if you should pull it or get help. <br />
And rewards are obviously as you would expect.<br />
<br />
Theres a reason why even to this day people remember the Rune of the Guard Captain-trinket... that is arguably one of the BEST trinkets you can get as physical dps pre-60. And how do you get it? its easy to remember, its an elite quest in hinterlands. An ELITE quest rewarding you with an incredible item... and obviously its not soloable, goodluck trying tho.<br />
Thats just one of the elite items that people remember since the knowledge is still useful on privates but more importantly in the upcoming official classic.<br />
<br />
Im not going to step too much into the raiding since its arguably more simpler and probably easier... but what you completely forget with your statement &quot;bosses that have 1 mechanics and classes that use 2 buttons&quot; is the reality... once again you look at things in theory and not actual gameplay.<br />
<br />
If we were to look at retail bosses right now, mythic in particular... they would have so many abilities it would feel intimidating to even try fighting against, but then when you do fight you realize half of those abilities dont even kill you. Theres probably like 2-3 abilities that instagib you nothing more... the rest can be healed over and are only there for you to avoid unless you want to put more pressure on healers which in some cases isnt even a bad thing to do, if the boss is almost dead. (Also nobody kills a mythic boss without first killing heroic version... so thats already alot of extra practice to avoid most of the abilities the boss does, mythic only adds 1 or 2)<br />
<br />
In classic, theres way less mechanics to tend with but ALL of them are lethal. I dont remember even half of them since its been a while since i raided that content.<br />

<br />
What if your raid already has kings-paladin? whos going to buff improved wisdom or improved might? :confused:<br />
And there is something you can do between buffing for sure... greater kings last 15 minutes.<br />

Dont underestimate judgements, judgement of light gives melee a passive healing whenever they attack the boss... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Seems like a poor attitude and decision. this will significantly impact the final game. <br />

<br />
<br />
hate to be the bearer of bad news Blizzard, but when your prominent point in a seldom update involves even the mention of the simple interface from over 6 months ago, I have extremely low expectations for Classic and don't really want to participate in your bastardized interpretation of Classic.<br />
<br />
Based on this reply, it really does seem like you only just got around to fixing player feedback from a demo you held 6 months ago. It doesn't seem like you've made any significant progress considering your mention of the interface. fixing lists of issues is fine, but no list of issues is complete since the testing was confined to two relatively simple zones.<br />
<br />
Classic seems like it's going to be seriously flawed and broken at arrival. You've lost all consumer goodwill Blizzard, and this response to months of information requests isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
Take the chill pill dude.</div></div><hr />

I didn't play Classic, nor am I a white knight for it, but I must say, it's definitely more of an MMO than WoW has been for years. I remember before LfD and LfR in early Wrath, I actually needed to be social and interact with people to do things like dungeons and raids, and even get gear. WoW has been a solo adventure with optional multi players and a soap opera for NPC's for years now instead of the make-your-own adventure MMORPG it used to be.</div></div><hr />

No. Classic Wow is not the same as Vanilla in regards to addons. It uses the modern addon API. None of the old vanilla addons will work in Classic unless they still work on modern wow today. Modern addons may work in Classic out the gate, but many will likely need a minor update to work with Classic since its a modified version of the modern client using vanilla assets.</div></div><hr />

bro of course its not exactly the same but getting a ton of points for good items is a valid model just like its been in past point systems. the PvP thing is another thing entirely. But acting like RNG in BFA is 100000% worse than in classic is idiotic. then you gotta remember that itemization in vanilla was straight up garbage</div></div><hr />

pvp is not another thing entirely lol.. Can't take out a part to try and have your point be valid. The RNG is terrible and is a BIG part of what is making BFA just as if not worse than WoD</div></div><hr />
