Sunwell loots - Take 2<br />
Don't rush the screenshots, it's the same as yesterday. However, the original screenshot had a few details I didn't notice in the first place : new item icons. Maybe it will help people who still can't decide if it's a fake or not. <br />
<br />
Top left part of the screen shows the icons of what look like a few swords, possibly a staff, and a shield. Bottom left look like a bunch of two-hand swords, the one in the top middle look like a staff or another 2h sword, and at the top right we've got some kind of purple crystal and a shield (this one doesn't look new though, can't really tell on the screenshot).<br />
<br />
For more details about this please read yesterday's post<br />

World of Warcraft reaches 10 Million<br />
And you keep thinking there isn't anyone to run instances with you ? <br />
World of Warcraft's community continues to grow, recently hitting a new high of 10 million subscribers around the world. In the three years since the game was first released, the way it has been embraced around the world has far surpassed our expectations, and we're grateful to all of the players who made that possible. We just wanted to take a moment to share the news, welcome the many new and returning players who entered the game over the holidays, and thank all of you for your ongoing support and enthusiasm.<br />

Rogue bugs - Stealth/Vanish and Cheating Death<br />
Hortus posted about two bugs affecting rogues, one of them is another fix for stealth/vanish and will probably make most of the rogues very happy.<br />
I'd like to inform everyone that the issue with Stealth and Vanish breaking 5 seconds after sapping or breaking stealth has been identified and a fix is being worked on. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4071474405&amp;postId=41178064022&amp;sid=1#0))<br />
<br />
I've looked into this issue. In order to assure that that a worse bug (which caused cheat death to not work at all) did not occur under specific timing circumstances Cheat Death will sometimes reduce damage by 99% instead of 90%. Although technically this is a bug, it is not one that we can currently fix. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881821791&amp;postId=41178064391&amp;sid=1#44))<br />

US Realms - Free character migration<br />
Free character migration once again for players playing on US realms. <br />
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to lower populated realms, assisting in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Tuesday, January 22 at 1:00 PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Tuesday, January 29 at 1:00 PM PST.<br />
<br />
In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br />
<br />
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.<br />

<br />
And that's why the original post says I redid all the tooltips to make them more readable on the new screenshot. ^^<br />
<br />
@niccholaswolfwood : Yeah I removed a few posts about this yesterday, and kept one locked to explain.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention actually knowing the precise itemlevels of all the items. :) I think I'll trust Boubouille's source for now, but that's just me. ^^<br />
<br />
@niccholaswolfwood: Thanks for the semi-confirmation. Not that anyone playing 2v2 believed the 15sec cd on Cyclone, but still... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
12.1% of the world population lives in europe, 56.5% in asia.<br />
20% of the wow playerbase lives in europe, 55% in asia.<br />
looks about right :P</div></div><hr />

Not that 13 euro a month is excessive, its a dinner or two movie tickets, a fee you apy once a month for countless hours of enjoyment, I pay it gladly.<br />
<br />
However, I dont think Id pay another monthly fee to subscribe to another MMO, and since WOW with its 10 million playerbase clearly isnt going anywhere, WOW's competition would be wise to consider loweing its fee or offering a different payment method to lure more customers. In the end, I predict, devs will resort to the Guild Wars method - 1-2 expansions a year to keep the money flowing in. It seems to work for them. As great as WOW is, its sucess is hurting the MMO industry a fair deal, even LotRo didnt cause as much as a dent, and the game was both awesome and the franchise was killer. Knowing nothing can beat WOW isnt music to new MMO investors' ears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In July they announced 9 million accounts, in september they released wow in China.<br />
China has 4 times more inhabitants then the US.<br />
<br />
So either they just have 1 million accounts in China, wich is actually not much considering, or the rest of the world has less accounts.<br />
Although i know that China still has areas where one has to look for civilisation it still looks wrong that China would only have 1 million accounts.<br />
<br />
Well anyhow, who cares really , i'm just typing this cause im bored :p</div></div><hr />

Wish I had an american account so i could comment the bug thread (not that blizzard would listen, but anyway).<br />
<br />
As i understand it this is how it currently works: It decreases all damage taken by 90%, and then absorbs 90% of the remaining damage. The result is 99% decreased damage during the 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
If they cant get the game mechanic to work this is easily fixed by changing the procentages so that the end result is the same as the intended game mechanic. <br />
How? Just change it to decrease all damage taken by 70% and then absorb 70% of the remaining damage. The result would be a 91% damage reduction for 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
(actually 69% would be a better aproximation, giving a 90,39% damage reduction).</div></div><hr />

<br />
the reason they can't do this is because some of the mechanics of cheat death come from vanish or w/e other modules of code they have floating around. to instead of that temporary immunity rogues see with vanish it might only be 70%. hence the blue post about, we know whats wrong, we just can't fix it.<br />
<br />
or if they do change it all of a sudden spell reflect will only reflect 70%. obviously in expanding the amount of skills and complicating the way talents and such work they overlapped somewhere and royally eff'd things up. <br />
<br />
could also be some latency issue because the blue post did mention timing as a factor.</div></div><hr />

WoW ist still gaining new members but compared to last year the ammount of new/reactivated members over time has decreased.<br />

Still would be nice to know how many farmaccounts from the &quot;proffesional&quot; farmers realy exists. Think that 200 accounts per Company is realistic - That multiplied by.. hmm 80-100 companys?<br />
Perhaps im totaly wrong, but Im shure that Farmcompanys have a large amount of paid accounts running.</div></div><hr />
