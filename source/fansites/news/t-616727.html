The Obsidian Sanctum - Loot List v2<br />
As I said a few days ago, I'm currently working on a better looking version of loot lists for each instance, below is a small preview of what item links will look like in the future. The biggest changes are obviously the new background on items to make darker items more visible, and the addition of Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com) tooltips to each link. There are a few nice things we should be able to do once all instances are updated. <br />
<br />
If you've got any suggestion regarding item screenshots or additional info (First thing coming to my mind is the lack of spec on Cloth items because I feel that they're pretty similar) you want to see in these lists, it would be nice to hear them in comments. (Nothing related to the layout, the final version will look slightly nicer)<br />

The Obsidian Sanctum is a fight against Sartharion and 3 Adds. Keeping one or more adds alive before killing Sartharion is called the &quot;hard&quot; mode.<br />
1 Add alive (10 Players) : Extra ilvl 200 Item<br />
2 Adds alive (10 Players) : Extra ilvl 213 item<br />
3 Adds alive (10 Players) : Reins of the Black Drake<br />
<br />
Pretty much the same with 25 players, but with slightly better gear. <br />
1 Add alive (25 Players) : Extra ilvl 213 item<br />
2 Adds alive (25 Players) : Extra ilvl 226 item<br />
3 Adds alive (25 Players) : Reins of the Twilight Drake<br />
<br />
Also, I'm currently looking for people who could contribute to the items loot list by submitting drop locations for items in Raids instances and Heroic instances, preferably with screenshots attached. <br />
<br />
We probably won't see any reliable info on item databases for a while and if you're running a bunch of instances on beta servers, it would be nice if you had a thought for me and wrote down the boss name for each item you drop and send the results in a <br />
lovely mail (boubouille@mmo-champion.com). Thanks to all the people who will contribute. <br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Warrior DPS changes<br />
As promised, here are a few dps changes. There will probably be a few more over the next few days.<br />
<br />
Fury<br />
Unending Fury changed to increase damage of Slam, Whirlwind and Bloodthirst by 2/4/6/8/10% (it no longer offers a rage discount).<br />
<br />
Arms<br />
Sudden Death now grants 10 rage, so that following the Execute you have 10 rage left over. In the course of testing this, we also decided Execute by itself wasn't doing enough damage, so it got a buff too (could be around +15%), which will also help the talent.<br />
Bladestorm breaks roots and snares when initially used. It doesn't break other forms of CC, largely because we suspect that if it did, that functionality in PvP would overshadow the actual cool whirlwindy part.<br />
Strength of Arms now grants 2%/2%/2 Str/Sta/Expertise per point. (Still 2 points total.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Death Knight tanking changes<br />
We have been doing some more tests on DK tanking, this time especially on raid bosses. We think the DK design has some limitations, which weren't showing up as much on tanking 5-player dungeons.<br />
<br />
Specifically, as many people suspected, the death knight really suffers when attacks fail to land, especially opening attacks. Having a Plague Strike dodged or parried can throw off an entire rotation, eventually leading to bad Obliterates because both diseases weren't up at the same time. Missing attacks is a fact of life for all tanks since it's hard to stack +hit and +expertise along with mitigation stats. However, existing tank classes have mechanics to let them &quot;burn off rage&quot; (or mana) to make up for those bad strings. The DK plays more like a rogue who can't get enough combo points in play. This had a deadly effect on DK threat generation, which just didn't compete with that of other tanks.<br />
<br />
We didn't want to just solve this with more free expertise because A) that has major PvP ramifications, and B) the death knights would start to hate expertise on their gear.<br />
<br />
Instead we are making some fairly big changes:<br />
Blade Barrier now procs when your Blood Runes are inactive. While the initial implementation of this ability was fun, as we added Death Rune mechanics it became harder to use, and the fast recharge on missed attacks made it even harder. Now it should be up almost all the time.<br />
We also found a bug where a naked, untalented death knight only had 2.5% dodge instead of 5% like warriors and paladins. With these two avoidance changes, death knight survivability should be very close to the other tanks, recognizing that avoidance is more dangerous than mitigation for a tank. As an aside, death knights, warriors and paladins currently mitigate a similar amount of damage, and druids may very well be mitigating too much.<br />
Frost Strike can no longer be blocked, dodged or parried. Frost death knights were losing too much potential damage and threat when Frost Strike failed to connect, putting Frost tanks in the awkward position of wanting to skip Frost Strike and just use Death Coil.<br />
We changed Rune Strike completely. It is now mostly a tanking ability meant to dish out high damage (and therefore threat). Rune Strike can only be used after you dodge or parry an attack. It affects the next swing, so it doesn't compete with global cooldowns and can be spammed to some extent. It hits for 200% weapon damage (remember 100% of that is the white swing you lost) plus a percentage of AP. It cannot be dodged, blocked or parried, and costs 10 runic power (for now). Think Heroic Overrevenge. :)<br />
I think we already announced these changes, but just to get them all in one place: Bladed Armor went back to attack power. It was changed only to match the warrior talent, which we changed back. Death and Decay got a decent threat boost to get it closer to the realm of Consecration and the new Thunder Clap. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
[b]Brewfest ending date<br />
11:59PM server time on October 3rd will be the last time you can turn in tokens or quests.<br />
<br />
Next to the Brew of the Month vendor is the guy you turn in the certificate to. He also sells brewfest items, is he going away then too?<br />
The ones next to the Brew of the Month vendors do stick around. <br />
<br />
Immunity/Resist based encounters<br />
We feel like a boss fight feels more epic when you have to prepare for it, even just a little bit. We think the fights tend to be more forgettable when you go into a raid with the intention of downing boss #1 for the first time and also manage to just kind of luck into getting #2. [...] Bosses that require different gear is one way to try to build up the expectation of fighting the boss instead of just showing up unprepared. Even in a very simple way, we hope that anticipation makes the fight cooler. Incidentally, that is why we are trying to establish bosses long before you actually meet them now. No more &quot;Surprise, C'thun (who?) is the end boss!&quot; moments. <br />
<br />
I'm talking mostly about resist fights, but bosses that are immune follow a similar thought process. I also won't claim we're 100% succesful, or that the kind of planning we have historically asked for is worth it in the end. But hopefully that logic makes some sense. I will say that it is something we're actively discussing, and it may be that the time has come to phase them out. I know that isn't a definitive answer, but that's because we just haven't decided yet. The reason we may choose not to answer a lot of questions is because they have boring answers like this one: we don't know yet.

Reasons behind the nerf of Lifebloom<br />
We nerfed Lifebloom because it was just too good. It just healed for incredible amounts at good mana efficiency that other healers would have had trouble matching. It's much more fun to buff spells than to nerf them, so we try not to let any of them get out of control. But sometimes it happens.

<br />
Wild Growth and Aoe Healing<br />
Wild Growth isn't intended to make you an awesome group healer. Shamans and Priests are awesome group healers, but can't hot the way a druid can. What Wild Growth is intended to do is let you heal a group when you are the only healer, or heal a group in fights (usually boss fights) where you don't have an opportunity to distribute hots to everyone. Without going into a lot of detail on new bosses in case you'd spoiler averse, there are bosses in Naxx and then the Malygos raid itself where you periodically can't get a bunch of heals up and yet the raid is still taking damage. Wild Growth is really helpful in those situations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10529928072-request-give-resto-some-love-just-a-little.html))<br />
<br />
Upcoming balance and feral changes<br />
For now, all I've got is that Starfall can't be dispelled.<br />
We are also discussing Mangle (Cat) or Rake buffs so cats don't feel so penalized by positional requirements, particularly in PvP. <br />
<br />
Bear tanks in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Druid threat is on par or greater than other tanks, and with the Swipe change, that includes group threat as well. Druid dps while tanking is very high. Druid dps while not tanking may still be the highest of the tank classes.<br />
<br />
Druid mitigation is so high in Naxxramas that we're worried they may overshadow the other tanks, in which case we might have to change it.<br />
<br />
So if you want to make an argument about Feral shortcomings, you'd either have to argue that they won't continue to be great in several raid tiers (which is a valid concern, but one that all the tanks have) or that you don't like their abilities. On that front, we have attempted to juice up several of the Feral's existing abilities, including changes to Frenzied Regeneration, Bash, Barkskin and Faerie Fire, as well as offering a new survival ability and a new burst threat ability, and finally letting you benefit from both consumables and weapon enchants.<br />
<br />
You might still argue that the druid abilities are different enough from warrior abilities that it may present a problem, though we'd like to avoid pushing them any closer together if we can help it.<br />
<br />
As it stands right now though, we have a lot of confidence that bears are going to be excellent tanks. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10529928432-should-i-reroll-another-class-for-tanking.html))<br />
<br />
Feral Q&amp;A<br />
I have confidence too, what about Cat DPS? Are you balancing the &quot;tank capable&quot; classes in a category by themselves, or will they have equal DPS to everyone else as per other posts and such?<br />
Cat dps is looking good at the moment. If you get +dps gear and focus on the +dps talents, your dps should be very competitive.<br />
<br />
Feral and balance PvP is much more problematic than PvE at this point... <br />
I'm not trying to duck PvP issues, but it has so many different issues and is very sensitive to the numbers on a few specific abilities and to player skill. It is much harder to do PvP tests and determine if things are okay. I will say on the Feral front, we are looking at buffing Rake and Mangle for cats to make up for the positional requirement of Shred. <br />
<br />
It seems as though the Druid forums are the only one of the forums in which &quot;HIGH THREAT AOE ABILITY&quot; isn't touted as part of their multi-target ability. Is Swipe going to have the same additional threat modifier as Death and Decay, Thunder Clap and Consecrate? <br />
Making an ability &quot;causes high threat&quot; is a last resort. It's wonky and tends not to scale as well as damage. Sometimes it's the only option we have to keep a tanking ability useful without turning it into the best damage ability available. In our last tests, Swipe's threat per second was very competitive with what paladins could dish out. We don't think at the moment that it needs more +threat to do its job. <br />
<br />
Also, please consider the effect on creating Armor pieces in so many slots. Like you said, there's going to be an issue with Mitigation, but also consider that Avoidance is going to be lower because we can't benefit from Parry or split our avoidance between Parry and Dodge to stave off diminishing returns.<br />
Yes, that is the risk. I will say that in Naxx, the bears are just taking less damage overall, which means even with lower avoidance, the huge amount of armor makes up for it, ignoring the fact that druid health also gives them a huge cushion for when they do take a lot of damage at once.<br />
<br />
We have done tests at higher tier levels, but if things start to fall apart, we hope to be able to right them in a timely fashion. Remember, it wasn't a stated goal for druids to be able to tank Sunwell. It is now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10529928432-should-i-reroll-another-class-for-tanking.html))<br />

Mage DPS lower than warlock's ?<br />
If your concern is just that locks (or whoever) is currently beating you on damage meters, I'll just say that 1) we're not done with our numbers, 2) the signal to noise ratio on this topic is particularly bad because virtually every (and maybe in fact every) spec claims that they have the lowest dps at the moment.

<br />
Frostfire Bolt<br />
We created Frostfire Bolt for 3 reasons: an interesting new spell that would cause a lot of exploation into which talents, gear and rotations benefited the best, a solution for those fights in which a Frost mage shows up to a Frost-immune fight, and the keystone for a new Frost + Fire &quot;elemental&quot; build. If you want to go respec every fight, you can still do that. But with Frostfire, you should be able to do a lot more damage than if you hadn't respec'd at all.

Ignite munching / potential spell change<br />
Let me be clear, that this is ONLY because you're wee. Ignite munching is a bug, but it's a hard one to fix, partially because it has a large lag component. We can't always tell which crit landed first. It is something we want to get fixed though. If we absolutely can't fix it, we're likely to change the spell.

Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/4/10544538454-gc-questions--big-big-list-cuz-were-scared.html))<br />
Will mages continue to have mana issues as much as they do currently, or is something planned to help? <br />
Yes, we are working on mage mana issues. They seem to run out too fast. <br />
<br />
Will mages be expected to be dominant AoE DPS? Or is AoE DPS also being flattened across the board? <br />
Great AE damage isn't a good niche in a game with so many single-target fights. Your AE will be good, but so will that of warlocks and moonkin. We won't keep your single target dps down in order to justify high AE dps. <br />
<br />
Will Frost be able to dps as strongly if not more strongly than Arc/Fire in PvE? Or is that still the PvP spec? <br />
We would like to see similar dps from all 3 trees. However, if you go for a heavy PvP build (in any tree), you will probably sacrifice some dps to get there. <br />
<br />
Will Arcane Blast be modified so it can be used as a main nuke? Or is that ship sunk? <br />
We want Arcane Blast to be used a lot. It's not Pyro.<br />
<br />
Scaling plagued mages throughout BC, will this be closely examined so it doesn't repeat in WOTLK?<br />
Yes. We aren't happy with what happened to mages in BT and Sunwell. <br />
<br />
Mages from BC have a stigma attached (see top guild interviews regarding least useful class), will we be given something to help justify bringing us to raids? <br />
We'll make your dps competitive. We're trying not to give *anyone* the one ability that gets them invited to raids. <br />
<br />
Will Evocation ever be updated? Lowered Cooldown? Made like Innervate instead of channeled? <br />
I don't know the answer to that yet. I think Evo is fine if mages don't run out of mana in 5 seconds. Evo could be part of that solution or not. <br />
<br />
Will Frostfire bolt be given a purpose, now that double dipping is gone. Is it simply an &quot;immunity&quot; fight fallback? <br />
No, we want it to be the kind of spell you can use all the time. But we want to get Frost, Fire and Arcane feeling good first. <br />
<br />
Will the Water Elemental get more survivability? More resist? More +hit? More scaling? <br />
All pets should inherit the hit of the master now. <br />
<br />
Will mages have purpose other than dps in raids so that so called &quot;hybrid&quot; classes won't fill in the mage spots after the single obligatory Winters Chill/Food/Scorch mage has been invited? <br />
Just be better / do more dps than those other classes and you'll earn a spot. We're not going to give you a reason other than that that someone HAS to take you. <br />
<br />
Is the numbers pass starting soon? We're worried that you may be running short (5 weeks) on time to properly see data regarding the dps passes. <br />
We've been in the middle of it for weeks. Don't worry about the time. We don't. If we looked at the ship date as a deadline, then we'd get sloppy and do dumb things. The truth is that in an MMO, game balance is a process not a destination. Even after the patch goes live, we'll have opporunities to make changes before you can head to Northrend. With all the changes we've made, there are going to have to be some quick patches to fix things we missed. And overall we'd like to address balance problems that do erupt in a more timely fashion - consider, before we could always say &quot;Eh, they'll still take the X for his Y buff even if his dps is low.&quot; We can't say that anymore. Now we just have to get stuff fixed.<br />

Ruin<br />
I'd agree that Ruin is about as close to a &quot;mandatory talent&quot; as exists. We did talk about changing it, but feared it would only be perceived as a nerf. To some extent we like what the talent does, because it does encourage some cross-spec'ing into another tree. The talent trees as originally conceived were more about options and less about picking a single tree and trying to stay within it.<br />
<br />
Now it's not perfect. Ideally there would be more talents you'd want in a second tree, or more alternatives in general. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/10529927875-blue-hypocrisy-in-action-rogues--talents.html))<br />

<br />
Meaning,, they don't want us to use pyro?<br />
Why not just remove that skill, or replace it as an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Frostfire is an interesting spell, I really wonder if they'll add other such combined spells.<br />
e.g.<br />
Voidfire for warlocks<br />
Arcane Ice or Flaming Arcane bolt for mages.<br />
Arcane wrath for moonkins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, physical dps leather is seriously lacking on hit rating so far.<br />
Expertise aplenty, which is of course nice, but still... gems should mostly fix that i guess.<br />
The legs look great, but then those don't have expertise and no armor penetration.<br />
<br />
Weapon speeds are as horribly configured as they were in TBC..<br />
Lots of 1.6-1.8 speed offhands, lots of 2.5-2.6 speed mainhands.. Ugh.<br />
<br />
Trinkets are still weird, i'd prefer stuff that's either always active or procs on it own rather than require you to manually activate. (Have a tendency of forgetting)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I´am a Raid Leader and NO ! DK will never get a tank plate item when a def warrior wants it. This class really pi.. me off. I will hate the days when you see 5 million DK´s running around just rolling on evey plate item they can get and do what ever they want.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jukaï</div><div class="date">2008-09-30, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reasons behind the nerf of Lifebloom<br />
We nerfed Lifebloom because it was just too good. It just healed for incredible amounts at good mana efficiency that other healers would have had trouble matching. It's much more fun to buff spells than to nerf them, so we try not to let any of them get out of control. But sometimes it happens. (Source)<br />
<br />
I agree with Lifebloom have been being to good to an extent. But when on level 80, two spell ranks further, 5/5 Genesis and 300 spellpower added you get numbers below the ones you are having on Live then there's just something wrong. *&gt;:(<br />
<br />
They need to up the base number value of Lifebloom with only like 20 or 30 healing to put it back onto the numbers we currently have on Live. Lifebloom will still then be nerfed heavily because it virtually has a standstill in power gain, but we gain small buffs such as a 3 second increasing of its duration (Nature's Splendor) and a bigger rotation window. (Gift of the Earthmother)<br />
<br />
With those two small buffs to our main healing spell and it put back up to par with level 70 value's, I can except the nerfing as a 'clean slate' from which Restoration Druids will have to build from again. (Naxxramas gear and up)<br />
<br />
<br />
Wild Growth and Aoe Healing<br />
Wild Growth isn't intended to make you an awesome group healer. Shamans and Priests are awesome group healers, but can't hot the way a druid can. What Wild Growth is intended to do is let you heal a group when you are the only healer, or heal a group in fights (usually boss fights) where you don't have an opportunity to distribute hots to everyone. Without going into a lot of detail on new bosses in case you'd spoiler averse, there are bosses in Naxx and then the Malygos raid itself where you periodically can't get a bunch of heals up and yet the raid is still taking damage. Wild Growth is really helpful in those situations. (Source)<br />
<br />
&quot;Shamans and Priests are awesome group healers, but can't hot the way a druid can&quot; ... *::) Yet they can spam more effective healing unlike Druids can.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if the 'raid encounters' GC refers to in Naxxramas is Loatheb, I'll be laughing so hard Nasa can hear it. A HoT that heals for less then a WotLK bandage (400 to 200) thats suppose to keep up with raid damage and health pools that has gone up into the several thousands ? Are you kidding me ?!<br />
<br />
Wild Growth needs to be reworked to make it similar to a group cast Rejuvenation spell, healing for the same amount a Rejuvenation on 80 does and slap it onto Gift of the Earthmother, Nature's Splendor and Replenish as its buffs.<br />
<br />
Honestly.. all the good feedback in the quite amount of sources and threads addressing to the effectiveness of HoTs being nerfed to hard on 80 (or WotLK if you will) is falling on deaf ears. Looks like this once proud Tree will become a Moonkin come next expansion.<br />
<br />
Cluck, Cluck!<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and for Nourish; It should compete with Healing Touch, not Regrowth! Up the healing bonus from HoTs so it gets to numbers Healing Touch gets, slap 0.5 second to its casting time, slap it on the 'Empowered Touch' talent.</div></div><hr />

I guess gonna increase increase spirit on mage pve sets and shortly afterwards they change Mage Armor to static mp5 because of pvp.<br />

100% wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Err...what exactly is &quot;hard mode&quot;? how is it different from Heroic? Never heard the term before...<br />
<br />
<br />
It's like doing Eredar Twins backwards.<br />
<br />
Boss encounters have a certain way of doing things. In Wrath there will be fights that you can do a &quot;harder&quot; way, and Blizz will give you more loot.<br />
<br />
As BB said, in Obsidian Sanctum for instance, there are 3 minibosses before the boss. You have the option of killing them, but if you don't they all aggro when you pull the boss. If you kill everything at once, you get a lot more loot from the Boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I presume the previous extra replaces the other item.<br />
<br />
So with 3 adds alive, you don't get 2 extra items + the drake?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope, I'm pretty sure you get everything.<br />
<br />
I know I saw like 5 loots AND the mount in that first News article about &quot;hard mode&quot; Sartharion that they did with all the adds up. I know there was &quot;10 man extra loot 1&quot; &quot;10 man extra loot 2&quot; and &quot;reigns of the black drake&quot; in the SS at least.<br />
<br />
I didn't know that the extra rewards scaled though, that's pretty cool. (Like if you can only handle one extra, you can still get 1 piece of loot.)</div></div><hr />

I'm just tired of playing classes where I don't really have to think, and with raiding at essentially a screeching halt since we're in the pre-expansion doldrums, I have just enough time to level a new class to 70. Anyone have any suggestions, tank or otherwise?<br />
<br />
<br />
With the changes to Swipe and TC, Death Knights have become by far the most complicated tank to play, for all of the reasons mentioned by Blizzard. Stacking diseases, relying on melee strikes to proc the diseases, and then relying on melee strikes to do damage based on these disesases means careful application and heavy reliance on getting it right, even with the new changes. <br />
<br />
If you miss a disease rotation, your threat is *screwed*, as your rotation is way off. Unlike other classes who can spam one ability and simply generate threat, DK's are limited on the back end by runes, as no particular ability is 'spammable' no matter how much damage you get, and unlike paladins, you don't start the fight with full 'mana' but have to earn 'runic power' via strikes actually landing. Unlike the other classes, DK AOE tanking skills (Death and Decay) have a very significant cost in runes (frost and unholy) which happen to be the two runes you use right off the bat to land your diseases. D&amp;D is not a spammable ability and you wont be able to use it whenever it is up, much *unlike* every other tank.<br />
<br />
And the guy above with the DK prejudice just flat out sounds like a douche. There's simply no reason for not letting anyone in your raid play a class thats is capable of filling a slot other than personal agenda, and anytime you let that interfere with enjoyment of others, that makes you a jerk. And it's going to make you less successful in raiding as well, considering you're going to see fights tailor made for them. Let your raid suffer, hopefully it will teach you a lesson.</div></div><hr />

Are you refering to rogues being overpowered in beta or right now? Wait let me guess you are talking about pvp?<br />
<br />
As of right now rogues in beta are way from overpowered. The combat tree is still a total mess and we have to use a spec thats been hiding in the bowels of our class for the last year. Using mutilate as our main spec you can clearly see that we are far away from the numbers we had before 3.0/wotlk comes out.<br />
<br />
The rogue class is not the 1. Dps class anymore. Any rogue with a sane argument will agree with me and the concerns we have been going trough in this beta are still lying in front of us attached to a piece of string.<br />
<br />
So do not speak from your ass and say rogues are overpowered because we are not anymore.<br />
<br />
Do not even talk about pvp. Its a whole different story. This game is not just a bunch of gladiators fighting the arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Obsidian Sanctum is a fight against Sartharion and 3 Adds. Keeping one or more adds alive before killing Sartharion is called the &quot;hard&quot; mode.<br />
<br />
* 1 Add alive (10 Players) : Extra ilvl 200 Item<br />
* 2 Adds alive (10 Players) : Extra ilvl 213 item<br />
* 3 Adds alive (10 Players) : Reins of the Black Drake<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty much the same with 25 players, but with slightly better gear.<br />
<br />
* 1 Add alive (25 Players) : Extra ilvl 213 item<br />
* 2 Adds alive (25 Players) : Extra ilvl 226 item<br />

The problem is I think it's calculating those values based on a level 70 character ('Requires Level 80' is in red text); since the values don't match what shows up for the wowhead tooltips. For example, the crit rating of 34 on the Pennant Cloak is shown as 0.74% in your screenshot, but 0.65% at Level 80 in the wowhead tooltips. As it's somewhat misleading, any chance you could either remove it altogether, or update it to calculate those values at level 80? <br />

I thank you for your insight. Would you qualify your statements as the DK being 'complex', as in you have actually think about what you're doing at all times, or 'difficult', as in even if you actually know what you're doing, you're relying to much on chance to be effective? I'm not so much interested in the things I can't control... that seems like a class fallacy more than anything. But I suppose, on the other hand, the 'chance' aspect of it would make me think more, as in &quot;Plague strike missed, so now I must do xxx action&quot;. Just so long as it's not, &quot;Plague strike missed, prepare for wipe.&quot; Would you have additional input in this regard?</div></div><hr />

I´am a Raid Leader and NO ! DK will never get a tank plate item when a def warrior wants it.<br />
<br />
So even if said DK tank is a better tank a better player then your warrior he still cant have tanking gear? I'm guessing healers have no rights to spellpower gear either (despite the removal of healer gear).<br />

Some of them are achievement base, if I recall correctly. <br />

One way would be to separate gear with straight mp5 from other gear; it tends to be inferior to other gear, but it is still usable. Another way would be to separate out gear that has NO regen stats, since that's either straight DPS gear, or holy pally gear (lol). Could separate out spirit, as said, but that's not a particularly great way to differentiate either. Separating out gear with spell hit maybe? Even there, I've run into a few pieces of spell hit gear that isn't bad for healing either (high spirit).<br />
<br />
On weapon speeds:<br />
I think Blizz has taken to balancing classes and making upgrades bigger upgrades by changing certain items. See daggers in badges and Sunwell in 2.4 to try and make dagger rogues better, and making most current weapons .1-.2sec slower/faster than ideal (1.6sec offhands, 2.5sec mainhands, 3.5sec 2-handers). Once weapons of the right speed come around, they'll be bigger upgrades than just the ilvl should dictate.<br />
<br />
On WoWhead's spell crit:<br />
Just use melee hit/crit/haste. For example, here (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=qu=3:4;minle=187;maxle=300;cr=24:84;crs=1:1;crv=0:0#0+13+1) is a list of all the current level 80 stuff with spell crit and spirit (including leather stuff, just ignore it; wish wowhead would allow a [(A or B) and (C)] search instead of just All or Any).</div></div><hr />

Thank you. For me, I've just been straight ignoring anything without regen and with hit; I figure the rest of that is &quot;viable&quot; healing gear. But you're right, even some items with hit have high spirit, so I don't know. Anything goes, I guess?</div></div><hr />

Could do spirit AND regen in a category too, as they make very poor dps items, but there's also only a tiny handful of them right now. <br />
<br />
My suggestion would really just be to let the classes figure it out for themselves. Healer classes should be able to tell pretty fast what's a potential healer item and what's not, and for DPS classes I recommend having a rough weighting for dmg/crit/haste/hit, and making use of Firefox's search function combined with Google's calculator.</div></div><hr />

The game isn't balanced for 1v1. Warriors are OP with support, that's why your asses get nerfed. Try getting some friends, it's called a massively multiplayer game for a reason.</div></div><hr />
