Latency Issues<br />
We’re aware some players are experiencing ongoing latency issues while trying to play World of Warcraft. We’ve taken steps to investigate the cause, and at this time we’re confident that our systems and network are performing properly. We are actively collaborating with our industry contacts to assist in the diagnosis and hopeful resolution of broader internet latency issues, which are suspected to be the cause of degraded performance. <br />

World of Warcraft Magazine #4<br />
From what I understand the fourth issue will be on it's way shortly and if you were subscribed for the first year, you will be receiving this issue in your mailbox soon. You can check out the fourth issue's cover art as well here- http://cde.cerosmedia.com/1A4d80e47506a60012.cde/page/1 It has a goblin vs. worgen theme.<br />
<br />
That said though, if you haven't resubscribed as of yet, you can do so on the site. We understand if you are disappointed in the wait times to receive your issues, but have been working with Future to make sure that the issues you are receiving are top quality.<br />
<br />
Information on the fourth issue, including a sneak peek, can be found on the official WoW Magazine site here- http://www.worldofwarcraftthemagazine.com/?gclid=CM6G_IL756cCFQE2gwodHDeCcg<br />
<br />
As for exclusive content, the artwork is exclusive on the cover and within the pages as are the interviews that you see with Blizzard Staff along with other insights shared within it from other community members etc. Those are not revealed anywhere else save for if the magazine has already been released to paid subscribers, guaranteeing that no one else sees it before you do.<br />
<br />
That said, the magazine is meant to be a bit of a keepsake of high quality (perfect for your coffee table) and we'll continue to keep an eye out for constructive feedback to pass along to Future, or you can reach out to them directly should you wish. I'm sure they'd love to hear from subscribers.<br />

If I was Blizzard, I'd do it too. I'd do it for just the money. Every mount bought improves the company. Blizzard is not a charity fund, they started the company to forge lots and lots of money. Sure they could have given this mount for free, but they decided it's a store product. And it's fine. It helps the company in many ways.<br />

You were able to get a replacement one by talking to an NPC. Which meant before this hotfix, SE = Infinite Abyss Crystals.</div></div><hr />

Interesting that it haden't been fixed say 15 months ago when Abyss Crystals were worth slightly more than nothing. Oh well... Thank you for solving that enigma for me :S</div></div><hr />

Actually, I think they started the company to produce video games. Making money is definitely a part of that, an important one at that, but you won't get anywhere with that motivation, without also a passion for what you do that overwhelms even the urge for monetary gain.</div></div><hr />

Big difference.<br />
<br />
Glory of the Cataclysm Raider - All the stupid-crazy extra rules, plus heroic kills of every boss (barring Sinestra). Reward: Drake of the East Wind<br />
Guild Glory of the Cataclysm Raider - Clear BWD, Tot4W, and BoT on Normal, as a guild (8/10 or 20/25 comp). Reward: Dark Phoenix (req Exalted w/ Guild and costs 3000g from the Guild Vendor)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's needed to make the legendary Shadowmourne. Obviously if you DEd it, you couldn't make it any more so couldn't get contribute towards the guild achi.<br />
<br />
So my guess is, they're giving us an NPC that just replaces it by asking so people wouldn't bother GMs about it but you can't DE or sell it because that would be and infinite source of shards or money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is true, and I'm not saying that all they want to do is money, that would be very untrue. Everyone who starts a business, especially a business that's not that reliable to produce a proper livelihood, needs the motivation, the DRIVE, to continue even if at first you fail. However, this part is for those that feel like they should give this mount for free, if they think, that it would be good for the company and their affiliates, they indeed should ask money for it. Because no company can survive without making money. They should make money. That's what they do. They put out their hearts and souls into the games not only to please, but also to make money.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walexia</div><div class="date">2011-03-25, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not about blizz making money , BUT about them making more money, blizz needs about as much more money as bill gates does.The way people are arguing for blizz here it's like they wanna send blizz employees on another vacation. As if faction transfers alone isn't making them a crazy amount of money already.I know alot of people who have faction transfered some even twice in a short span of time.<br />
If you have extra money, don't make the rich people even richer, give to charity or help start a program to help the disadvantaged get better.<br />
<br />
But then again that is just my opinion, i cannot force people to spend their money.All i know is that this isnt a free to play mmo, we should not be (again my opinion) encouraging blizz to offer stuff to us through the market since we already support blizz through our 15 dollar a month subscription.It's understandable for &quot;free to play &quot; mmo's to use an out of game &quot;market&quot; since at the end of the day they have to make ends meet to continue to support the game.<br />
If they want us to buy stuff, then that's what we have&quot; in -game&quot; vendors for .They can introduce a currency.Maybe even make the points we make for achivements points worth something.</div></div><hr />

First, funny comic.<br />
<br />
Second, if no one did anything then it's not happening. Tell your guild to stop making stuff up and log in already. Those lazy guys using latency as an excuse because they don't want to play. <br />

<br />
I agree completely. A lot of people declare they &quot;Can&quot; in fact afford to get one just don't want to waste money on a &quot;Stupid mount they don't have to work for&quot;. I think anyone who bitches that this mount is a &quot;Waste of money&quot; and want to go out of their way to grief everyone who gets it, should follow their own &quot;Advice&quot; by no longer getting things such as Beer, Cigarettes, Junk food, movies, games, name brand clothing, etc. After all, all of that stuff isn't needed to survive and a waste of money. :P</div></div><hr />

A lot of online games use REAL money to make the game more fun / better if you want to spend the money, there is noting saying you HAVE to pay, most people will not, most are happy with what they have. <br />

It's fun to assume stuff, isn't it? It's so much easier then trying to see that people are different and enjoy different things in life.<br />
I still enjoy the game and i don't need the mount to 'believe' that I still enjoy the game. I know I do. I will spend my (keyword here being -my-) money on some pixels so I can ride/fly around on a lion with wings. LION.WITH.FREAKING.WINGS! How cool is that?!?!<br />

But granted, Big Scary Dragon is cool too. Although the cost of buying a herd of sheep to feed one is going to bankrupt me. Atleast the lion is happy with a gazelle. And when all else fails I can always use a Dryad. That's close enough.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Slow mounts&quot; don't technically exist anymore. All mounts scale to your skill, so even lvl 60 mounts fly as fast as lvl 70 mounts as soon as you learn the appropriate skill.</div></div><hr />

Everyone who starts a business, especially a business that's not that reliable to produce a proper livelihood, needs the motivation, the DRIVE, to continue even if at first you fail. However, this part is for those that feel like they should give this mount for free, if they think, that it would be good for the company and their affiliates, they indeed should ask money for it. Because no company can survive without making money. They should make money. That's what they do. They put out their hearts and souls into the games not only to please, but also to make money.<br />
<br />
Yeah and Blizzard is really in danger of going out of business. There is a point where a company goes from making a healthy profit to flat out greed. If they used the money to improve the game and take care of their employees, that'd be one thing. But all that money goes to line Kotick and his management's pockets. Blizzard barely sees any of that money. They've outsourced half of their customer service and they are cutting corners in every facet of development to squeeze out more cash and giving less content for more cost.<br />
<br />
It's not a very well known fact but a big chunk of the rank and file Blizzard developers (not the leads, most of who got moved to Titan but the guys in the trenches doing most of the coding) left to go work on Rift at Trion. WoW makes all that money and yet the majority of Blizzard developers don't see any of that because they are a wholly owned subsidiary. Blizzard is actually one of the worst managed highly-profitable companies in history. They sold out to an educational company 15 years ago because they could hardly make payroll before they made Warcraft 1. I'm sure they've regretted it ever since after being tossed around from conglomerate to conglomerate over the years never having control of their own destiny.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe use one of the easily obtainable mounts that isnt a drake? I mean you've got gryphons, wyverns, hippogryphs, nether rays, flying carpets &amp; choppers if you have the profession, and maybe something else i forget. Then you have the more rare mounts like the flying horse from Halloween, Mimiron Head, or flying rocket.<br />

<br />
It's just a way to milk the consumer, ring nearly every red cent out of them. This isn't exclusive to blizzard or pc games, but consoles as well. The only thing is that the consoles don't have a steady income like blizzard does as is with the subscriptions (xbl and ps+ is a fraction of what blizz makes monthly), so it's a little more understandable from their standpoint to help maintain their networks. You didn't think the first one was a bad idea? There's nothing different about it, it's just another &quot;smash and grab&quot; on consumer wallets.<br />
<br />
But they need it, poor guys there at blizz, I mean, Titan maybe the first MMO ever to launch in the black because WoW has been easily paying for that work, as well as SC2, and D3. Maybe if enough people buy this mount they'll be able to afford multiple artists so they don't have to recycle nearly everything in the game. Or maybe we'll finally get our Dance Studio that was promised to us over 2 years ago. OR perhaps the guild hall/player housing. Maybe, just maybe we'll see some money thrown our way into WoW, the game that makes them their paycheck. LOL, yeah right, we'll still get the shaft, they'll get lazier then they are now even, people will still blindly defend them.<br />

When a business, say an amusement park, looks over their profits they look of ways to put more money back into their park to draw in new customers, and keep the usuals coming back. So they expand, get a new ride/coaster, add a water park, something like that. Do you see where I'm going with this? The consumer here is expecting that their wild profits like they made off of TRH and such in the past gets injected back into the game. Maybe get more artists to stop recycling EVERYTHING in this game. Maybe get that dance studio and other promises to us. Instead of delays on content, lack of content, and poor community treatment.<br />
<br />
Don't tell people to &quot;grow up&quot;. It's a wildly known fact that this game is a luxury other developers dream to have. Their last financial report was disgusting to look at, seeing the insane profit margins, which allows them to &quot;pay up front&quot; on all their new projects, yet maintain a healthy business status. We just want money put back into the game that's making them money, that's all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
to my knowledge, no achievement requires that you purchase these items. bottom line is that the mounts and pets are items that are not necessary for your success in the game. thus, it is completely a vanity item. <br />

Also so many ppl from my guild cant play due to this latency issue... And guess what? There is no one to blame. Blizz didnt do anything, ISP company didnt do anything, and yet it doesnt work :D<br />
<br />
It's funny Blizz is going to convince people of that because it it completely their fault. Sorry if this gets nerdy.<br />
But.<br />
In the patch before Cata where they changed the client to be able to download while you play, they also changed their data packet structure for the game in such a way that many automated traffic watchers on the net started identifying wow traffic as p2p (torrent) traffic.<br />
<br />
ISP's hate p2p traffic. The other cool thing about p2p traffic is that it is not latency dependent. ISP's use hardware devices to categorize and prioritize traffic based on what it is and if its real time (latency) dependent. Make your traffic look like some idiot downloading porn.. and what a shock when some back bone ISP treats it like a red headed step child and your ping shoots up to 1500.<br />
<br />
They have undone their mistake.. but will take some of the NET a while to figure it out.</div></div><hr />

There is a point where a company goes from making a healthy profit to flat out greed. If they used the money to improve the game and take care of their employees, that'd be one thing. But all that money goes to line Kotick and his management's pockets. Blizzard barely sees any of that money. They've outsourced half of their customer service and they are cutting corners in every facet of development to squeeze out more cash and giving less content for more cost.<br />
<br />
It's not a very well known fact but a big chunk of the rank and file Blizzard developers (not the leads, most of who got moved to Titan but the guys in the trenches doing most of the coding) left to go work on Rift at Trion. WoW makes all that money and yet the majority of Blizzard developers don't see any of that because they are a wholly owned subsidiary. Blizzard is actually one of the worst managed highly-profitable companies in history. They sold out to an educational company 15 years ago because they could hardly make payroll before they made Warcraft 1. I'm sure they've regretted it ever since after being tossed around from conglomerate to conglomerate over the years never having control of their own destiny.<br />

For a company that has 2 golden eggs, one being WoW and the other being Call of Duty, they sure to enjoy their penny pinching by charging for items that should be included in your monthly fee.<br />
<br />
Your monthly fee includes the ability to play the game for the month, nothing more. You're owed nothing beyond that. If they so chose, Blizzard could decide to do not a single content patch or update at all. They're not forced to do anything but provide the basic service you pay for - the ability to play for the period of time you paid for. Anything above and beyond that is essentially their incentive to keep people playing. Content patches provide fresh content to keep people interested and playing. If they choose to have a select portion of services available only to those who pay extra (tiered content, after all, is not a new concept) then it's perfectly within their right to do so; they're not robbing you of anything that you paid for.</div></div><hr />

Ha, cute. They aren't obligated to make adjustments to the game or fix things, they do it simply out of the generosity of their hearts right?<br />
<br />
What a load. They are, in fact, REQUIRED to make these changes and adjustments because otherwise people will grow tired and stop playing. They don't make changes, they don't listen to the customer, they lose customers, they lose money, they shut down.<br />
<br />
We have a say in what goes on by paying to play. But go ahead and set your standards so low they can do w/e they want and you'll pay them, i'm sure that won't have any negative consequences on the quality and future of this game</div></div><hr />

<br />
The micro-transactions offer a lot to people who have the money and enjoy little vanity items. It does absolutely nothing to impede the gameplay of those who don't buy them. <br />
<br />
The downside is, they're suddenly seen as a Company... which gamers seem to have a hard time accepting. I don't know where the disconnect is, but it's as if people see a struggling game developer as someone true to the cause. The fact of the matter is, these developers all have families to feed, houses to buy, and want all the shiny things everyone wants (despite the grotesque cover some people put on --- that's a nice $400 video card you bought bro). <br />
<br />
I anticipate that, at some point, DLC will start to catch on. It's survived its inception and moved over to XBOX/PS3. It won't be long before the MMO market catches on and there's nobody in a better position to test it than Blizzard/Activision. <br />
<br />
All in all, I'm pretty disappointed with how the game went downhill. They had it right in Burning Crusade (maybe not balance-wise, but content etc). If they had continued doing whatever they were doing then, I'd most likely still be playing.<br />
<br />
For anyone looking for a new MMORPG, give Rift a try. Shameless plug, I know, but it's a new experience and a lot of fun!</div></div><hr />

Perhaps he likes the look of it? And with the changes all mounts go max speed, so his &quot;shitty 150% speed gryphon&quot; is probably 310% speed artwork he liked.<br />

<br />
That's a bad argument. I can afford a gold grill for my teeth so i can look like Flavor Flav, but I'd never buy them. I think they're awful looking and a waste of money. Many people feel the same way about the mount. Paying $25 for a virtual mount for a specific game that you won't even be riding in 6 months seems like a complete waste of money, even if you do have money to blow. However, in both cases people can justify the purchase to themselves, and so to them it's worth the money. In the end to each their own, but I'm still going to say it's a waste of money, even though I could afford it easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the entire problem. A lot of us can afford it, yet paying real-life money for in-game vanity items sets a dangerous precedent. So long as players continue to make this successful, there is a possibility that the envelope will be pushed to make the Blizzard Store even more controversial in the future. Why put an excellent reward in the game for completing a noteworthy achievement when you can sell it in the Blizzard Store for $25... $35... $50... and have it appeal to a broader audience of subscribers who couldn't be bothered to earn that vanity item in-game, but have no problem opening their wallets for something shiny from the Blizzard Store?<br />
<br />
I can't speak for everyone else who also disagrees with these micro-transactions but, for myself, the way some of you throw around your money does negatively affect the rest of us for the reasons mentioned above.</div></div><hr />

Nice try. The monthly fees cover said expense along with everything. This is just some extra play cash for them to put into, well, I don't know what, as it's not going into the game as content is beat/dead (4.1 is a joke, and it's not even out yet! And they've been working on the stuff in that since pre-cata lol), Firelands is going to be a 7-boss raid only when it comes out 3 months from now, non-set epic drops will be recycled tier art again. This game is in ICC for 12 months mode, it's in terrible shape right now. <br />
<br />
These are problems that they can probably help a bit by either hiring MORE or BETTER personnel to put on the game. More artists = more art = less recycled well everything. Better programmers = less trouble shooting time, more efficient coding. <br />
<br />
The impact of them pulling their A, B, and C teams off of WoW and putting them onto other projects is clearly impacting this game for the worst. They're hurting this game so bad that the sheeple are upset deep down and are taking it out on anyone who steps forward and questions blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Speculation. I assume you can back that up with a blue link?<br />
<br />

Speculation. See above. Even if this does end up being the case, there are plenty of other games where you can play &quot;dress up doll&quot; if this is your focus, as opposed to the other gameplay and social aspects.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
When the vast majority of the player base isn't through regular mode content, it is nothing like ICC. Hyperbole.<br />

The last thread you dropped this same line, and chose to ignore my response. Go to wikipedia, look up &quot;The Mythical Man-month&quot;. The wikipedia article alone will probably teach you enough about software development to have a more informed opinion and realize how ridiculous this statement is. It is basically the bible of software development, and any development company will have it as a standard read for management.<br />
<br />

Blizz is selling VANITY items, items that doesn't affect your gameplay the least. If you don't want it / can afford, don't buy it. If you DO want it and can afford, buy it. Stop bitching about it, last time they gave shitloads of money to charity thanks to this.<br />
