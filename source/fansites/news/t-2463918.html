What keeps people from the same guild from doing this on a failed key to keep it at current level? Do people now have to put 4 spots and never run with a guildie? <br />
What’s to stop pugs from doing this? “Hey, this is failing, let’s have 2 people leave so we can start over.” Is Blizz then going to penalize the 2 people who left from rejoining the group they left while rewarding those who do not?<br />

The traits on Azerite Armor will all be unlocked when you obtain a piece of gear.<br />
The artifact power will instead give you abilities on your Heart of Azeroth, many of which are active abilities.<br />

Transmog with the non-answers, as always. &quot;Maybe someday.&quot; &quot;Well, you see, we didn't do these sets that people love because we wanted to churn out more 'themed' sets that people think are dull and uncreative.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's getting to the point where I'm convinced there's only two artists on staff and they're so overworked from the zone assets (and now Kul'Tirans, which I feel like Ion was about to joke cost a raid tier of art resources but thought better of FOR ONCE) that they can't do much else</div></div><hr />

Yea, don't worry about they guys shitting on your positive response to ANYTHING that blizz does. Obviously if you like something they do, you're a shill. Welcome to MMO Champion where we all play the game we hate and circle jerk each other with negativity instead of posting any constructive feedback on the official forums!<br />
<br />
Edit: The QnA was average, no new info and clarifications for upcoming changes. Not everyone reads mmo champ and knows EVERYTHING about what's comsing up and such. These Q&amp;As might be their only source of upcoming WoW stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember this, most of the ppl that come here just come to QQ, complaing or ppl that dont play anymore and just want to keep hating the game. <br />
<br />
So if you like it, like i do just enjoy it and ignore the forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meh. They respond to questions that people have. They don't answer the &quot;difficult&quot; questions. They never do, that's not what these Q&amp;As are for, and people are always so surprised and upset about it. These are supposed to be for the casual players that don't visit mmo champ. <br />
MMO Champ gives us the data mined info that we aren't supposed to see so nothing comes as a surprise to us. I can't remember seeing the allied race release info anywhere except blizzcon, here, and the one recent blue post. If you don't visit mmo champs or other news consolidating sites, you probably did not know about the release dates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see the difference in the 2 (one guaranteed one random) but i really hate titanforging. It's a dumb system that undermines progressing through current content. I think that valor tokens should be used to buy gear up to 5 ilvls under current normal raid. Then can be used to upgrade that same gear 5-10 ilvls at a time. Would make things that much smoother. Also, replace AP on bonus rolls with valor and its a great system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What would they add with part 2? There's no new content :(<br />

Agreed to an extent. Leaving should be punishable behavior, but leaving because you're group just wiped on the first boss 3 times in a row without even coming close to downing it and none of you want to keep banging you head against a wall, that leave would be justified. There should just be a voting system where if 3 or more people want to leave, the group disbands with no punishment. Otherwise, punish leavers.<br />
I have no idea what the punishment would be, tbh. An hour or w/e debuff that prevents you from entering instances is pretty slap on the hand worthy.<br />

First of all, it's too*.<br />
Secondly, people like what they like and bitch about what they don't. I think calling to fire someone is a bit extreme. If you (not you, Echo, but those complaining) don't like the direction of the game, leave. Show them with your wallets and attention. You pay for a subscription, with gold or money, you're still giving them what they want and showing that the things you don't like are not enough to drive you away. Coming to mmo champ still shows interest in this game. Talking about this game is just drawing more attention to it. There never seems to be a real discussion on these forums, just qq'ing back and forth.</div></div><hr />

Do people now have to put 4 spots and never run with a guildie? <br />
What’s to stop pugs from doing this? “Hey, this is failing, let’s have 2 people leave so we can start over.” Is Blizz then going to penalize the 2 people who left from rejoining the group they left while rewarding those who do not?<br />
Your fix can bring about all new kinds of problems.<br />
<br />
I was talking about a &quot;punishment&quot; for leaving, which does not exist currently. If you cannot complete your key with the set parameters then it will go down as usual. We are talking about something like a long cooldown before you can try Mythic+ again if you leave without a valid reason, or if you are kicked and reported. A punishment that would discourage people from leaving at all.<br />
<br />
Let's say:<br />
There are 5 people... if after some time they decide they can't continue and want to disband the party, a pop up appears and says <br />
&quot;Why are you leaving? <br />
1. The group can't continue. <br />
2. I need to go. <br />
3. Someone left, we can't continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they choose option 2, then they are punished. If they choose option 1 and at least 1 more player (or 2) also went for option 1, then no one in the group is punished for leaving. If 2 or more choose option 3, then only the first person who left is punished. If they just disconnect without choosing it would be just like choosing option 2 (after some minutes away, to prevent legit dc's), unless 2 or more players went for options 1 or 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe last time they said this was before Blizzcon.<br />
I don't know why they don't give a buff like old WG and give a damage/gold/exp buff for the lower populated faction in a given area. The weekly reward SHOULD NEVER CHANGE. The fact that someone suggested that, and it went through at least 2 more people before being implemented is stupid. If Alliance is always under-represented, give them the buff until they aren't. It's a good sytem that is implemented horribly and the changes being made are half-assed and won't fix anything in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Way, way, way too harsh as far as the month bans that quickly. I feel like slowly extending bans would be good but yes they should end on a very harsh note, and a vote system would be good at regulating that. As would a running tally viewable in game or raider.io at least. And of course all infractions should be compiled account wide as to avoid character hopping alleviating bad behavior.<br />
<br />
So for example, if someone has to leave for a legit reason, run is clearly failing, vote to disband and nobody takes a penalty. If it cant be solved amicably, the player just leaves and takes a +1 tag on their &quot;dungeons left without consensus&quot; tally. So if a player was a chronic leaver, it would follow them and they would get ostracized by pugs. It could then reset at the end of the season. It is important to reset the counter to allow people the chance to correct their behavior instead of sticking them in an &quot;undesirables&quot; club permanently.<br />
Or yes, an enforcable &quot;unable to enter mythic keystone content&quot; penalty in game could come up. 1st leave is a warning. Second leave is six hours. Third is a day. Fourth is three days. Fifth is a week. Sixth is sitting the rest of the season out. <br />
Maybe it seems harsh, but after six instances of wasting 4 other people's most precious commodity- the time they have left in their lives- a penalty should be quite strict. Besides, you think they'd get the point. People who are mythic-holics would be scratching their eyes out to get back into that content.<br />
<br />
Is this draconian? I hope not. You want to give people a fair shot to reform while giving those who have been wronged a sense that they will not be wronged again.</div></div><hr />

I'd argue that WoW isn't really designed for that many play styles. It is in theory, like, on paper. Like, in the marketing, it sounds like there's stuff there for a certain casual playstyle, but there really isn't. The game has zero meat to it at all for more than a couple of weeks after hitting the level cap unless you're a hardcore PVPer, someone who does mythic+ or someone who raids heroic or higher. <br />
<br />
They don't actually design for multiple play styles. They dangle the car keys in front of the player base like they're stupid babies, hoping they don't realize they're funneling all the actual fun content into a small part of the player base, the part they actually care about.</div></div><hr />

Seems very fair to me. The I'm always one for more strict punishments, but this allows for accidental DCs and such. Very good system. I thin Overwatch implements a similar system<br />

I mean...you just named 3 different play styles they cater to. Also, casuals can pet battle or do WQs to keep up their heart or get some gear. And I think that's about all you can do without &quot;skill&quot; (and pet battles can require skill but is much easier to do than raids or m+). If you run outta things to do, unsub and come back next patch!</div></div><hr />

If the group gets disbanded, the key would go down anyway. Regardless of a punishment system. No one can retry it, but whomever ruined the group gets punished.<br />
<br />
And if you choose &quot;1.The group can't continue&quot; just because you want to get away without punishment, if the rest of the group went for option 3, you are being flagged as the leaver because you were the first who left and you get punished anyway.<br />

<br />
<br />
The game has zero meat to it at all for more than a couple of weeks after hitting the level cap unless you're a hardcore PVPer, someone who does mythic+ or someone who raids heroic or higher. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am none of those 3 but still play 20 hours a week. Playing a DH all quests have been reset to me from previous expansions. I love doing quests that I hadn't done in years. I am a goofy pet collector/battler. I complete the pvp weekly quest every week. I engaged in light RP on a rp server. I go to lore debates on my rp server. I like doing legacy raids for Transmogs and try new looks ( I know ). Sometimes I achievement hunt. other times I do 1v1 duels. I do the daily emissary world quests. I will m+ some lower keys but have never looked at or use raider.io. I like raid finder 90 percent of the time. Some times I do these things each week, some times I don't get to everything. I feel zero pressure to get gear or compete at a high level. The aesthetic and look to the game is still appealing. I think there might be many players like me. Certainly not a majority. But I would think at significant number. I will probably get flamed for the above play style which is why players like me don't say much and are a 'silent' player base.</div></div><hr />

The team wants to move away from unlocking the same traits over the course of the expansion.<br />
The traits on Azerite Armor will all be unlocked when you obtain a piece of gear.<br />
The artifact power will instead give you abilities on your Heart of Azeroth, many of which are active abilities.<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;These abilities could be earned and distinct based on the content that you earn it from such as raids or Mythic +. &quot;<br />

...means. If they seriously consider to lock, say, an additional AOE ability behind completing a +15 in time or a single-target ability behind cutting edge....then....well....no, that would not be cool.<br />
<br />
In Legion only cosmetics were locked behind activities. Not actually usable character abilities.

Leaving should be punishable behavior, but leaving because you're group just wiped on the first boss 3 times in a row without even coming close to downing it and none of you want to keep banging you head against a wall, that leave would be justified. There should just be a voting system where if 3 or more people want to leave, the group disbands with no punishment. Otherwise, punish leavers.<br />
I have no idea what the punishment would be, tbh. An hour or w/e debuff that prevents you from entering instances is pretty slap on the hand worthy.<br />
What would be some good punishments? A month ban after 3 times? A day ban after 1 and a week ban after 2?<br />
How about a -2 on your reward chest the week you do it. You will have probation for a time and if you leave again in that probation time the -2 will be added to the pre-existing debuff to your reward chest. Every further leave after the first resets and doubles your probation. If you left 5 times you are banned from mythic dungeons for the season.</div></div><hr />

Have no problems understanding their reasoning since it's all the playerbase fault. I played on high pop pretty balanced PvP servers from open beta classic up until WotLK. It was great before Battle Grounds got cross server, you encountered the same people in BG's as you did in world Pvp, to the point that people joined the same TS-channels etc. <br />
<br />
Then, due to people faction swapping or transfering to servers where their faction had an edge things got skewed and most often unplayable for the other faction. Now they try to balance player populations with people that actually like world Pvp, and not only turn it on due to there being no risk to it.<br />
<br />
This is a means to an end, balancing the populations to bring back the good world PvP. Granted the incentives is poorly timed atm. with the ilv rewards weighing in on PvE progress, but I can see the overall plan.<br />
<br />

What they say isn't even a half-measure, it’s just a “made-up” excuse. In fact, this is same thing that they sang about &quot;class fantasy&quot; in Legion and I'm not talking exclusively about particular phrase, but about all purpose/story of WM appearance. <br />

And the Mythic + issues of people leaving can be so easily solved I can't believe there are even engineers working for them... Just add a &quot;reason for leaving&quot; option in which if 2 or more players in the same party choose &quot;can't continue&quot; then there are no penalties.<br />

The problem would be the trolls, and people who would fuck over others because it's fun, they can't give tools to them. If humans were less shitty and assholes, then your solution would be perfect.<br />

<br />
The biggest challenge of WoW is designing for the many different audiences that play the game.<br />
The game is richer for having a variety of audiences over the team focusing on designing for one archetype.<br />
<br />
And that, ladys and gentlemans, is why this game will continue to lose year after year. You can´t develop a game to be jack of all trades master of none, all lose, no one wins.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trumpcat</div><div class="date">2019-01-25, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The part where there are no class overhauls is most disappointing. Although I did not expect there to be, but still would have been a very needed thing. Classes are dull, <br />
We have no advanced or varied mechanics, no any ability that feels like design thought went into it. Look at every other popular MMO or even MOBA games or even Diablo and its clones, look at any RPG. WoW class abilities visually and mechanically are the worst. Press A until it procs B, press C whenever it is ready, while they are all essentially the same - does X amount of damage. <br />
<br />
So an example of a more diverse mechanic: in WoD a Mage could conjure a crystal which absorbs all damage done to it for a certain amount of time, then explodes dealing the absorbed and augmented damage into an AoE.<br />
<br />
Not crying for the crystal back, but for variety and complexity that break up the spamming 2-3 buttons at a target. <br />
<br />
Playing the game itself is dull when the classes are progressively dulled down. They are not adding novelty and variety to a very old game that needs it to maintain interest. They are doing the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
Do we have to wait until 8.3 for Azerite to add anything interesting to classes that should have been there at start?</div></div><hr />

&quot;They agree that item level 400 is a little too high at the beginning of a raid tier. It won't be changed this week, but next week if it is available again it will be reduced to 385 and another form of reward will be added, such as war resources.&quot;<br />
<br />
What is this 400ilvl quest and where do I get it?<br />
<br />
You can get it only if you are Alliance on NA servers, there's like a quest for alliance to motivate them to turn on Warmode, this quest requires you to kill certain amount of Horde players if I'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />

Strange. I would have never thought the devs see war mode on/off this permanent. I thought they meant it to be fluid &quot;hey, it's monday, let's kill some xy scum!&quot; / &quot;hey it's friday, let's chill and turn it off&quot;. I also thought they would want everyone to participate in warmode by default, not to force .. I'm sorry inb4 triggering ppl... discourage people from using it. <br />

<br />
Yeah, this is definitely one of the biggest problems...<br />
<br />
I don't see why Blizzard doesn't go back to how it used to be when they had a much more narrow audience (which wotlk proved it worked if you look at the sub numbers). And if they want more players? Don't just open up the game to be for more audiences - make the other audiences come over and try be part of the audience they already had! If it doesn't work, no biggie. If it works, great, a person who didn't know he'd have fun with WoW, has fun with it!</div></div><hr />

Why not just tie whatever punishment in with the timer? If you leave before time expires then you get a debuff or whatever. If you leave after time expires no penalty.<br />

I don't think anybody is &quot;okay&quot; with it. We are just relieved that FINALLY something is being done about it. I 100% believe that Blizzard knew all of these problems from the get go and purposely left their systems underdeveloped so that they could release the &quot;fix&quot; as patch content later. Why add NEW content when you can just fix the already broken content and call it new?</div></div><hr />

This is standard Blizzard stuff my dude. They take away variety, choice, options, etc, and then tell you that the system they put in to replace it is actually somehow giving you MORE variety, choice, options, etc.... They did the same thing with talents. They did the same thing with abilities. They have done the same thing with armor sets.</div></div><hr />

Will be stunned if he's still part of the team by next expansion.<br />

Such idiots are working at Blizzard. They have to remove the global cooldown change. 15 years it was OK and suddenly it is evil!? WTF!?<br />
<br />
Bellular hinted on this few days ago, Instead of fixing created problems they see, Just fix the real problems.<br />
Said previously owing to my disablities I am a slow player, But at times even I can see the issue.</div></div><hr />

This is absolut the wrong direction. <br />
Accessibility is the fucking wrong way.<br />
<br />
I dont need any more claps on my shoulder just for logging in. <br />
The whole game is nothing more than a slot mashine for cosmetics. <br />
Gear and power lvl of a character is only a number.<br />
<br />
I dont feel invested in my chars at all. Just shit on the tastatur, roll your <br />
char to maxlvl in a matter of hours and press some buttons to get loot boxes.<br />
Do this for like 1-2 days and restart again with another char, because you'll think that would be<br />
any more fun than the last 10 times. What a joke.<br />
<br />
Im playing Wow for 14 years now and since the middle of Wotlk i get more and more dissappointed <br />
from any major change/patch. <br />
<br />
Its like waiting for a good old friend for the last 10 years. You remember the good and exciting times <br />
with him just clearly, but becoming more and more distant to each other over time. To that state, that you <br />
know he won't come back anymore. Checking every couple of months if he's returned. <br />
Just to get let down again and slowly realising that it doesn't make any sense to wait anymore.<br />
<br />
I played all of the expansions and tried every patch, searching and craving the friendship and relationship <br />
to my old friend. <br />
<br />
But its clear to me now... <br />
It's time to pull the plug. <br />
Farewell my friend.﻿</div></div><hr />
