US Support delays 
Answers to GM Tickets might be a bit slow today for US players. 
 On Sunday, September 9, we expect possible support delays between 6:00 AM PDT and 6:00 PM PDT due to some planned local area power maintenance. Players that submit GM tickets can expect slightly longer wait times during this time. This maintenance will not affect normal gameplay. We appreciate your patience during this time.

Comics<br />
Today we've got a comic from Manic Graffiti (http://manic.comicgenesis.com/) and another one from the official site. (It seems that this one is a bit buggy, if you don't get the voidwalker comic I mirrored it here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/ss182.jpg))<br />

Website<br />
Guild recruitment forums are now available on the left menu. I didn't post rules in the first place but it would be nice to not have excessive bumping or double posting on recruitment posts. (Now you're warned, I can delete posts !)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-09-09, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand. Had the same reaction !</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuggle</div><div class="date">2007-09-09, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol? Expect to wait longer? Last time I filed a ticket it took them 4 days to reply and it was just a blank message with just the closure on it. It was the first time and the last time I try to file a GM ticket.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pasco</div><div class="date">2007-09-09, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm it is very situational how fast the GMs react, sometimes you get an answer just after a few minutes, and sometimes you have to wait a few hours but days? I can not remember this, and I write almost one ticket per week. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, to get back on topic, news of the U.S. support delays has ruined my day.</div></div><hr />
