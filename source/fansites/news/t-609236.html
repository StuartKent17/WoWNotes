New class confirmed, the Witch Doctor.<br />
Witch doctor can cast out locus swarm, which spreads between targets and deals damage. Can summon mongrel things that he can cast locust swarm on, which buffs their damage. Outdoor environment now. Quite pretty in that vibrant, slightly cartoonish Blizzard graphical style. Like with StarCraft 2 and it's similarities to the original, Diablo 3 looks and sounds, at least at a glance, quite similar to previous games. Witch doctor also has a mass fear type of ability. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/884/884836p1.html))<br />
Witch doctor using a fire bomb spell. Can summon a wall of zombies that stays stationary, but the zombies in the wall flail their arms and do damage to their oponents. (Source (http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/884/884836p1.html))<br />

Facts<br />
Diablo III is being developed as the definitive action role-playing game, and a true continuation of the Diablo series. Players will create a hero from one of five distinct classes, such as barbarian or witch doctor, each equipped with an array of spells and abilities. As these heroes adventure through rich and varied settings, unraveling an epic storyline and engaging in combat with hordes of monsters and challenging bosses, they’ll grow in experience and ability and acquire items of incredible power.<br />
<br />
The game takes place on Sanctuary, a world of dark fantasy. Unbeknownst to most of its inhabitants, Sanctuary was saved some twenty years ago from the demonic forces of the underworld by a few brave and powerful heroes. Most of those warriors who directly faced Hell’s armies -- and were fortunate enough to survive -- went mad from their experiences. And most of the others have buried their haunted memories and pushed the horrors from their thoughts. In Diablo III, players will return to Sanctuary to confront evil in its many forms once again.<br />
<br />
Diablo III will be a fitting sequel to Diablo II, with the easy interface, fast-paced action, and visceral gameplay that Diablo players have come to expect and enjoy. It will also include many new features that will take the Diablo action-RPG experience to the next level.<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
Five powerful character classes to choose from, including the barbarian and witch doctor<br />
Brand-new 3D graphics engine enhanced with spectacular visual effects and Havok physics<br />
Numerous indoor and outdoor areas detailing new regions in the world of Sanctuary<br />
Interactive environments with dangerous traps and obstacles, and destructible elements<br />
Randomly generated worlds bolstered by scripted events for endless and dynamic gameplay<br />
Vast assortment of fiendish monsters, with unique attack patterns and behaviors<br />
New quest system and character-customization options for the ultimate action RPG experience<br />
Multiplayer functionality over Battle.net with support for cooperative and competitive play<br />

Press Release<br />
PARIS, France – June 28, 2008 – Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today revealed Diablo® III, the newest entry in its critically acclaimed action role-playing-game franchise. The announcement was made during the 2008 Blizzard Entertainment® Worldwide Invitational at the Porte de Versailles Convention Centre in Paris, France. A cinematic trailer and an extended gameplay demonstration with commentary from the development team introduced the game to the thousands of players in attendance. <br />
<br />
“We’ve wanted to expand on the epic story and gameplay elements of the Diablo universe for some time now,” stated Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “We know that players have also been long awaiting a return to the series, so we’re very excited to be sharing this announcement with Blizzard gamers here in Paris and around the world today.”<br />
<br />
Diablo III will pick up the story twenty years after the events of Diablo II. Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal have been defeated, but the Worldstone, which once shielded the inhabitants of the world of Sanctuary from the forces of both Heaven and Hell, has been destroyed, and evil once again stirs in Tristram. Playing as a hero from one of five distinct character classes, players will acquire powerful items, spells, and abilities as they explore new and familiar areas of Sanctuary and battle hordes of demons to safeguard the world from the horrors that have arisen. The first two characters classes -- the barbarian and the witch doctor -- were shown as part of the announcement at the event today in Paris.<br />
<br />
Diablo III will feature a custom 3D-graphics engine to render lush indoor and outdoor areas of Sanctuary with a high level of detail and vivid special effects. The game’s physics-enhanced environments will be interactive and destructible, offering traps and obstacles that create added danger for players and monsters alike. These elements, along with a new quest system and random scripted events, will be integrated into the game’s random-level generator, giving Diablo III the ultimate combination of dynamic gameplay and replayability. Cooperative and competitive play will be available online through an upgraded version of Blizzard Entertainment’s renowned online gaming service, Battle.net®. <br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment is developing Diablo III for simultaneous release on the Windows® and Macintosh® PC platforms. Further information about the game, including details on the other character classes, major new features for the single-player and multiplayer components, system requirements, pricing, and availability, will be announced as development progresses.

FAQ<br />
What is Diablo III?<br />
We’re developing Diablo III to be the definitive action role-playing game, and a true continuation of the Diablo series. Players will create a hero from one of five distinct classes, such as barbarian or witch doctor, each equipped with an array of spells and abilities. As these heroes adventure through rich and varied settings, unraveling an epic storyline and engaging in combat with hordes of monsters and challenging bosses, they’ll grow in experience and ability and acquire items of incredible power.<br />

<br />
Diablo III will be a fitting sequel to Diablo II, with the easy interface, fast-paced action, and visceral gameplay that Diablo players have come to expect and enjoy. It will also include many new features that will take the Diablo action-RPG experience to the next level. We look forward to going into much more detail on our plans for Diablo III as development on the game progresses.<br />
<br />
What’s new about Diablo III compared to the previous Diablo games?<br />
Exciting new classes like the witch doctor bring new gameplay options to the table. Returning classes, like the barbarian, have been completely redone with new skills to give them a feel unique to Diablo III. New customization options will provide for an even greater level of character specialization than the previous Diablo games, allowing the player to create unique characters brimming with power.<br />
<br />
Diablo III is powered by a new graphics engine that can display characters and hordes of monsters in lush, fully 3D environments. Powerful special-effects systems and Havok-powered physics allow the player to lay waste to Hell’s minions in spectacular ways.<br />
<br />
Also, Diablo III builds on the random environments of the previous Diablo games by introducing a host of new ways to create random scripted events throughout the game. This creates a dense and exciting world alive with quests, NPCs, dynamic encounters, and viciously challenging new monsters and bosses. Diablo III’s environments add a great deal of interactivity to the game, including destructible elements and environmental obstacles that can be turned against your enemies.<br />
<br />
In addition, Diablo III will benefit from Battle.net upgrades that will provide some exciting new features for players. Cooperative online play remains a primary focus, with multiple enhancements being planned to make connecting with your friends easier and cooperative gameplay even more fun. We’ll have more details on all these aspects as well as other exciting new features at a later date.<br />
<br />
Can you give an overview of Diablo III’s storyline?<br />
It has been twenty years since the events of Diablo II. Of those who faced the Lords of Hatred, Terror, and Destruction in the battle over the fate of Sanctuary, there are few still living who can bear to remember the horrors that the Prime Evils wrought upon the world. And of those who did not witness the terrible events firsthand, most believe the stories to be little more than myth. But something evil is stirring once again in Tristram, and it may already have claimed its first victim: Deckard Cain.<br />
<br />
Will there be any other familiar faces in Diablo III (other than Deckard Cain)?<br />
Yes. Players will encounter several new characters as well as a number of characters from the previous games.<br />
<br />
Will players be visiting any familiar locations in Diablo III, such as Tristram?<br />
Yes, definitely. Players will return to Tristram and certain other locations from the previous games, and they’ll be exploring new areas of Sanctuary as well. <br />
<br />
How many character classes are included in Diablo III? What are they?<br />
Five character classes will be included in the game, two of which, the barbarian and witch doctor, were revealed when the game was announced at the 2008 Blizzard Entertainment Worldwide Invitational. The other classes will be announced at a later date.<br />
<br />
Will players be able to choose the gender of their character, regardless of class?<br />
Yes. Players will be able to create male and female characters for all five classes.<br />
<br />
Will Diablo III be playable over Battle.net? What new features can we expect?<br />
Yes, Diablo III will be playable over Battle.net, and Battle.net will offer some exciting new features to enhance players’ Diablo III experience. We’ll announce specifics and go into much more detail at a later date.<br />
<br />
Will there be a single-player component in addition to multiplayer?<br />
Yes. In addition to battling the hordes of Hell cooperatively with friends over Battle.net, players will be able to adventure through the world of Diablo III solo. More details on both the single-player and multiplayer experience will be revealed at a later date.<br />
<br />
What will questing be like in Diablo III? Will it be similar to Diablo II?<br />
Our plans for the story and quest mechanics are still under wraps. We’ll go into detail on those elements of the game at a later date. We can say, however, that we expect to have class-based quests in addition to the main story-line quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
TECHNICAL ASPECTS<br />
What engine is Diablo III running on? What graphical enhancements are included?<br />
Diablo III runs on a custom 3D game engine for rendering full-3D characters and environments. The 3D game engine not only simulates advanced animation sequences and sound effects, but also uses a custom physics engine that allows for realistic object dynamics and cloth simulation.<br />
<br />
What are the system requirements for Diablo III?<br />
We’ll announce specific system requirements at a later date.<br />
<br />
<br />
RELEASE PLANS<br />
When will Diablo III be released?<br />
It’s too early to estimate Diablo III’s release date. As with all Blizzard Entertainment games, our goal is to create a game that is as fun, balanced, and polished as possible. We intend to take as much time developing Diablo III as is necessary to ensure the game meets our own high expectations and those of our players.<br />
<br />
Will the game be released in multiple countries? Will the release be simultaneous? Which countries and what languages will Diablo III be localized in?<br />
As with all of our games, our goal with Diablo III is to release the game simultaneously in as many regions as possible, and to localize the game in several languages. We’ll have more details to share about countries, languages, and specific dates as we get closer to release.<br />
<br />
Will Diablo III be available on Windows and Mac simultaneously?<br />
Yes. As with all of Blizzard Entertainment’s recent releases, Diablo III will ship for both Windows and Mac simultaneously.<br />
<br />
How much will Diablo III cost? Where can I buy this game?<br />
Pricing and availability for Diablo III will be determined and announced closer to the release of the game.</div></div><hr />

old news. thanks Blizzard for proving me right after 3 years. Everyone in the world called me a liar. Now what I said in the above linked post just proved me right in today's announcement from Paris. I gave MMO-Champion a 2 day notice about my post from 2005 - Without naming names the &quot;webmaster&quot; failed. I posted the EXACT concept of D3 almost 3 years ago - And tonight it came true.<br />
<br />
And if you are retards like the webmaster let me point out in my orginal WoWGuru post where I specifically say &quot;Hell invading heaven&quot; as the concept of Diablo 3.... Wow, I am proved right and I gave MMO-Champion a chance to post this before it was announced - Boulib you are a bitch. Just to get your press pass at WWI you stopped doing what your site got famous for - Reporting shit.</div></div><hr />

Yes, we were &quot;wrong&quot; about the announcement of a video game. thus...the end of the world or something.<br />

The only people that are douches are the people who said outright there would be no Diablo 3 all had the shit argument of &quot;lol but the team's gone!&quot; Thankfully, I could count those people on two fingers.<br />

<br />
No they were not. You also don't magically add a strong vertical glare to the eyes. Arthas didn't have any such glare. Diablo on splash screen does. So your argument fails just as much. Just stop QQing and admit that you were wrong. Blizz gave people enough clues to guess it's Diablo III (LOST numbers, runes in pentagram, bomb icon near Diablo HEL Rune, Smile rune near Diablo HEL Rune, Horn at the bottom of the screen, Icy surrounding = icy tomb etc. The only thing those those eyes had in common with Arthas was that they were blue, that's about it. OMG blue eyes mean it's Lich king! You know... that demon was in Icy Tomb, which means his eyes won't be fiery red. They will turn fiery when he gets out of his icy prison.</div></div><hr />

The eyes still resemble the Lich King's, and Blizzard did that on purpose to mislead people. Simple as that and everyone not seeing that just misses some brainfunctions, most importantly the one that keeps you from being cocky and insultive because you made a lucky -guess- about something and go pretending you derived it with your superior intellect.<br />

<br />
12:20 -- It's apparently still an action RPG. Same interface -- red health and blue orbs. Skill bar at bottom. 3/4 overhead perspective. Character with 2 axes hacking at demons in what appears to be a foggy cathedral. Has a jumping attack where he smashes the two axes into the ground.<br />
<br />
12:21 -- The axe guy is the barbarian class. Says improvements have been made, like the hotbar for skills. Using the mouse wheel and tab key you can quickly switch between skills. Whoing inventory. Appears to still have slot limits. Using enchanted axes with frost and lighting ,which stuns and freezes opponents.<br />

12:31 -- Diablo 3 is first and foremost a co-operative game, says Blizzard. New Witch Doctor class can summon pets, control minds of his enemies, and cast diseases.<br />
<br />
12:33 -- Witch doctor can cast out locus swarm, which spreads between targets and deals damage. Can summon mongrel things that he can cast locust swarm on, which buffs their damage. Outdoor environment now. Quite pretty in that vibrant, slightly cartoonish Blizzard graphical style. Like with StarCraft 2 and it's similarities to the original, Diablo 3 looks and sounds, at least at a glance, quite similar to previous games. Witch doctor also has a mass fear type of ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so it's Diablo 2.1? I don't care, as long as I get a pretty Diablo nao.</div></div><hr />

old news. thanks Blizzard for proving me right after 3 years. Everyone in the world called me a liar. Now what I said in the above linked post just proved me right in today's announcement from Paris. I gave MMO-Champion a 2 day notice about my post from 2005 - Without naming names the &quot;webmaster&quot; failed. I posted the EXACT concept of D3 almost 3 years ago - And tonight it came true.<br />
<br />
And if you are retards like the webmaster let me point out in my orginal WoWGuru post where I specifically say &quot;Hell invading heaven&quot; as the concept of Diablo 3.... Wow, I am proved right and I gave MMO-Champion a chance to post this before it was announced - Boulib you are a bitch. Just to get your press pass at WWI you stopped doing what your site got famous for - Reporting shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
ROFL<br />
<br />
You are pretty stupid arent you. Nearly everything in your original post has since been proven to be incorrect. Some examples:<br />
<br />
&quot;In regarding the Alliance race, as it's currently unknown:<br />
<br />
It will most likely be Pandaren. They have already planned those guys out for the most part ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As for player housing - Highly doubt that is coming since Guild housing (guilds in D3 will be able to invade another guilds town and destroy it) and is a big feature of D3 I wouldnt see why they would want to take away from that.&quot; (D3 isnt an MMO)<br />
<br />
I can see why Boulib took your &quot;information&quot; at face value, because its pretty much all wrong. I think YOU failed here.</div></div><hr />

I didn't QQ, just expressed my indifference to this announcement and asked for more MMO news (and a side dish of RTS) on a site called MMO Champion...weird heh?

If we're not even close to a release for SC2, which was a lot more done than this is, you're not seeing this game for at least another year and a half methinks.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it makes no sense. The fact that Diablo is back will take a lot of story twisting. Maybe, hopefully, it's related to the ice otherwise that was a pretty rotten trick.</div></div><hr />

Believe me, they have`nt `wasted` one minute on this game, it will sell millions, Blizzard know it will, which is why they developed it.

<br />
It's called a sequel. I just sold my Xbox 360 because I found GTA IV to be worse than GTA:SA. Shocking, I know.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm watching the gameplay trailer and it has me really pumped. It's the Diablo gameplay. Millions loved it years ago and likely millions will love it again. It's not as deep as say WoW but it's enjoyable and that's a fact for many. I personally will buy it, I can tell you right now I'll love it. Just watching the trailer I can feel myself clicking like crazy again and having fun while I do it.<br />
<br />
Be real about Diablo though people. It's not a deep game at all but it's a fun game. Keep it at that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vakir</div><div class="date">2008-06-28, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How can you people say it looks crap.. i think it looks amazing, i love games like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess to be fair, the Barb's animations are so similar to one another that the entire gameplay trailer looks boring to anyone who isn't hardcore Diablo. They don't have a lot of technical achievement to work off of, so it comes down to what we're seeing. I'd have prefered a caster class to show off, I dunno, some diversity.<br />
<br />
<br />
the game series is a masterpiece. trust me when i say this is going to make halo/gta look like a fucking joke game when it comes out. the game has more potential then wow ever did.<br />
<br />
Halo/GTA really aren't that great. Console games in general, especially today, are overrated pieces of filth. But I wouldn't call anything from Blizzard really a masterpiece. They're fun diversions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dayoandy</div><div class="date">2008-06-28, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">get real kenhax, it will never compete with halo etc. <br />
<br />
and yes it may sell millions, it will never be as big as wow though, and never bring in the revenue wow does. and bearing in mind all that revenue, as stated about it being Diablo 2 with a face lift, says it all really. anyway, it will be a fair time before its out so i guess things can change</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah.. right. Let me compare something.<br />
<br />
Halo: Combat Evolved, a first-person shooter for the Xbox console, Windows, and Mac OS X<br />
Halo 2, the sequel to the first game released on the Xbox and then later for Windows<br />
Halo 3, the last game in the series' main story arc released for the Xbox 360<br />
I guess you're right, Blizzard really should really try to be as inventive as Bungie Studios.<br />
<br />
<br />
You said GTA?<br />
<br />
Grand Theft Auto<br />
Grand Theft Auto 2<br />
Grand Theft Auto III<br />
Grand Theft Auto IV<br />

and yeah it will be a diablo 2 with a face lift, that's pretty obvious. that's what people (diablo fans) want, like me. i honestly couldnt care less. diablo never was about inventing new things. diablo was about something very different and if you dont know then it's your loss.<br />
<br />
btw. it's not like starcraft 2 isnt just starcraft with a face lift. or halo, or any other sequel to a game.</div></div><hr />

It will be the same old crap. That's what you want. Diablo never did anything new. Diablo is something different. Starcraft 2 is just Starcraft with a face lift, which means Blizzard is probably the worst large game company out there in terms of innovation. Madden has a better track record for improvement. The Call of Duty franchise has always improved on itself (with the exception of 3 but that was a different developer), as well as pretty much anything Valve does (everything they do seems to be better than their last project). There are good sequels, Blizzard is just selling its fans short by hoping they will eat up this bullshit.<br />

You're critiquing an alpha at best.. what do you expect? They didn't even show an actual boss. The barbarian they were playing came with gear and skills. Not to mention if it's anything like previous diablo games, depending on which mode (normal, nightmare, hell) you're in the difficulty can ramp up a lot.<br />
<br />
If you want to actually sound intelligent when you critique a game, at least wait until they have it complete up until Beta testing. All of Blizzard's game to date have been &quot;fun&quot;. <br />
<br />
You were probably one of the people who said that Protoss were overpowered when they showed SC2 gameplay footage of their Motherships.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that they created a level 1 barb and then went out to show off some moves on level 1 mobs. Unless i was misstaking i saw several gold items on him (gold being epics or uniques). The vid was to show us how the game works, not the level of challenge.<br />
<br />
But no, that's pretty much how it is (or at least was in D2), tank, spank, loot, smile. Think outside the box (the box being WoW).<br />
<br />
And to be honest, you haven't played a game until you have played D2.<br />
<br />
Just hoping that Blizz finds a way to get rid of all korean hackers and dupers... They didn't do too well in D2...</div></div><hr />

What does Diablo do that isn't in WoW? I get the whole story differences but can you really say the gameplay is different? WoW and MMORPGs in general borrow heavily from the dungeon crawling genre. Diablo is not &gt;all Diablo=every other dungeon crawler out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I try to explain, is that the graphics aren't so important. Because the name of the game is Diablo, it must be good (I hope so). Because Diablo is Diablo, and not WoW. And thats basiclly it. I love the genre of Diablo.<br />
When you want to have a game with uber graphic, leave WoW. The graphics there are crappy... but it's a mmorpg, the playing is more important than the graphic.</div></div><hr />

It's just a game, it's not going to change the genre or do ANYTHING new or special. It will be a solid experience for fans of the series and genre in general. But the cynics among us must look at the game and see that it is neither new nor innovative. <br />
<br />
<br />
Seeing as how you've seen less than 1% of the entire game, you are in no position to say whether or not it is &quot;New&quot; or &quot;Innovative&quot;. Be less of a tool will you? From what I've seen the physics engine alone is innovative and looks extremely interesting to try out.<br />
<br />
You dislike the genre so you call the game trash? The early stages of this game seem to dwarf the other games of this genre. WoW didn't provide many &quot;New&quot; or &quot;Innovative&quot; concepts either. They simply did it better than everyone else, which is what Diablo III will do to it's genre.</div></div><hr />

They announce that this will be played over battle.net, but the FIRST thing that crosses my mind when they say that was the horrible, broken economy, with hacks everywhere. Even on closed D2 realms, players really weren't &quot;legit&quot;. Sure, I put up with that in Diablo 2 because there wasn't any option. But if given a choice between WoW's clean realms and a hacked D3 economy, I'm sticking with WoW. <br />
<br />
They didn't even address this problem at all in the FAQ as far as I can tell. You've got to be kidding. Simply put, I'm never going back to an RPG like that. That was not fun and I don't miss it.</div></div><hr />

You can already tell this is Diablo 3: How to Milk a Franchise. Nothing new, nothing changing. Again, still buying the game but it's NOT doing anything special.

You complain about challenge, which will improve a lot from now until release. Not even taking into consideration the fact that on gameplay videos they stack characters in order to showcase their abilities. You complain about &quot;two types of enemies&quot;. You saw one unfinished dungeon..You're probably complaining about only having two characters too aren't you?<br />

If you don't enjoy this genre of games, simply don't buy it. But you have no reason to call the game trash before even playing the final version. That's called ignorance my friend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
both things are true. i wouldnt expect anything else from diablo 3 tbh. and as i said before, i dont mind/care. its the differences that made diablo special for me (and i did play all the other dungeon crawlers as well, and they were all inferior to diablo because i enjoyed it more). i understand its not as appealing to you as it is to me.<br />
<br />
i just hope they wont somehow magically reincarnate diablo himself tho.</div></div><hr />

Obviously you are one of the kiddos who thought that this would be WoW with D2 classes. Suprise suprise, it's not. It's Diablo, the way that Diablo always has been and imo always should be.<br />

You saw a FRAGMENT of what the game offers, how can you base ANYTHING off of that?<br />
<br />
They showed 1 new class, new graphics, new monsters, loot, skills, skill-swapping, new bosses, new storyline, new tactics to destroying mobs (destructible walls, something they haven't even SHOWN in WotLK yet, rather than mentioning it). I got all that from a 7 minute video, and all you get is the same old repetitive comment, &quot;D3 is nothing more than D2 with a facelift.&quot; Also, it's still a &quot;work in progress&quot; to quote the lead developer of the game.<br />
<br />
They haven't revealed 1/4 of the game, who knows what they have in store.</div></div><hr />

daiblo isnt coming out because of wow, to make up for the lack of new content there. and the coming out of WOTLK has nothing to do with it either. and unlike you, id actually prefer if they would just forget about wow and make all their people work on diablo 3, to make that one even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halo 1 - 3: FPS games. You shoot and kill. Nothing has changed but better graphics.<br />
GTA 3 - 4: Same game just bigger world and better graphics.<br />
Half-Life 1 -2: FPS games. You shoot and kill. Physics? Who cares its not like level interaction was shown with Diablo 3 trailer or anything crazy like that...<br />
Call of Duty 1 - 4: FPS games. You shoot and kill.<br />
<br />
You get the idea? Diablo 3 is Diablo's gameplay carried on to a new story and setting. It has greatly enhanced graphics and various gameplay alterations to make that gameplay a bit more fun. All sequels do this. Hardly ever is this different and when you see a major departure it is often times considered a break from the series. Mario games come to mind. All the old 2D platformers were the same just a different story and graphics. Mario 64 was a break from the series but since then Sunshine and now Galaxy are just refined from 64.<br />
<br />
To argue against a game simply because its similar to the older games in the series is out right moronic. If you changed the gameplay so vastly then you should simply break from the series. Instead Blizzard set out to please the Diablo 2 fans and give them what they've wanted now for years. Better graphics, altered gameplay that enhances your experience but doesn't change it greatly, a continuation of a interesting storyline, and a new class.<br />
<br />
Stop making such lame arguments. I understand you don't like the game(s), but leave then. You have no place discussing them if all you intend to do is bash them.<br />
<br />
I say this as someone who is a huge WoW fan and was a huge Diablo 2 fan. They are DIFFERENT games, both brought/continue to bring me joy.</div></div><hr />

if u think developin new games will kill old games (whine qq d3 they will invest time and wow will suck and die) then u failed at life.<br />
it's a software house, they make big games, they'll do big games. and whiners just suck big time<br />
<br />
for all people conceived in batle.net.. soz for u guys :( but this is not my issue since i'll just single player d3 :D and stick with wow</div></div><hr />

Nothing on that entire splash ever indicated that it would be diablo 3. (Save for 1 rune) Blizzard was simply pulling people's leg once again as they've done several times. (April Fools etc.) The sad part for me is that it was too obvious already to announce Diablo 3 at this time... was hoping for something... new and special.</div></div><hr />

I mean I WILL enjoy this game but I'm not going to overlook the glaring issues or lack of change I see because I played the game in middle school and now I can't bring myself to hate it. And for the record, Half-life 2? You just backed yourself into the wall here. Half-life 2 is probably the best example I can think of for a franchise to not succumb to BS and do things differently. Physics puzzles, deeps world with side games (portal anyone?), great new challenges, driving!, new weapons etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
See now you're being delusional. Portal is a entirely different game from Half Life 2. It was an idea from some students who were hired by Valve. Because it was released in a package with Half Life 2 doesn't make it the same game or even a part of the game at all.<br />
<br />
You must have never played Half-Life then. It had puzzles (not physics based, but puzzles, again minor unless you want it to be otherwise) like HL2. News weapons? Are you serious? Then I can claim new armor or weapons in Diablo 3 as well. &quot;Great new challenges&quot; WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? Diablo 3 will have new quests! Driving? Who's to say Diablo 3 won't have something different that adds to the game (HL2's driving was on rails basically but you wouldn't care to actually look at things honestly) like oh say environment interaction over D2.<br />
<br />
You keep skipping points to fit your argument. It's down right pathetic. You purposely ignore all logic.</div></div><hr />

I love everyone of Interplay's old dungeon crawlers: both Icewind Dales, both Baldur's Gates, both Fallouts, and Planescape Torment. Interplay did so much for the genre and they get none of the credit. Strikes me as odd because any dungeon crawling fan out there will tell you Blizzard is not a great developer becuase they do things new, they're great because they take everything everyone else does and lump it into one game. Kind of like a greatest hits CD, it has no artistic merits in it's own right but people still buy it to enjoy the music.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay buddy, remove the sand from your vagina and get back to me. Maybe then you won't sound so stupid. You blatantly bashed Diablo III based off of 10 minutes of pre-alpha gameplay and you have the nerve to call me ignorant?<br />

Then what was your point at all with the UI? Shockingly Blizzard is using a UI similar to the other games in the franchise. Are you going to seriously try and compare Hellgate's world to Diablo's? They're nothing alike. Your comment at absolutely no point other than to try to bash D3. You failed horribly at it, move along.<br />

No one is returning to Blizzard to make Diablo 3 that made Diablo 2 or 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The developers are not the same. No one who made Hellgate: London is working on Diablo 3. Developers who worked on Diablo 2 and 1 formed Flagship Studios which is true but your point is well pointless. The games are still very different. It's like comparing the other action RPGs of the time to Diablo 2 and 1. They fall under the same genre but they have differences which make them unique products. Difference which makes someone like one game but not the other. The videos alone show these differences.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-06-28, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, if any of you are still listening/watching the stream the lead developer for Diablo 3 is going into much greater detail of what tweaks and differences are there from past Diablo games. Large scale combat for example is being talked about. You never encountered that in previous games from the series. Showing again that you can't judge a game from a pre-alpha gameplay trailer.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-06-28, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh You've never played/beat/read about Portal have you? It takes place inside the Half-life series. The story anyway, I know the first idea for the game was Narbacular Drop a game final made by students at the Digipen university. ANWAY...<br />
<br />
The physics changes Half-life brought about at the time were revolutionary. No one had seen that done before like that. Integrating physics into gameplay? New enemy AI, actually using cover, giant stalkers that really suprised you when you first had to take them on etc. <br />
<br />
Again I'm mad at Blizzard right now because of all the missed oppurtunites. The story line is probably going to be the same overly serious, poorly voice acted schlock that makes you laugh not think. If it isnt? Cool but you have to admit the track record for Blizzard's voice acting is bad. Probably not the end of the world so no sense worrying. <br />
<br />
But they could have done something different with the gameplay. Like I dunno taking it off of the battle.net crapfest, adding more than one class, making talent trees (I know sounds like WoW but it would add diversity to the classes), and after doing some research it seems you have to play through the game to unlock a difficulty past normal. WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT? I mean I can spout good ideas all day but they may not be feasible for development. I don't know what they can do and what cannot be done to improve the genre.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes I have played Portal. I can take and post a picture of my Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and The Orange Box packages if you so desire. I can show you my played time on Steam for each game, how they've all been beat. That still does not make the games the same game. They're entirely different games though. If you can't get that through your head then I can't help you out at all. Half-Life 2 came out LONG before Portal by the way, even ruining your argument more.<br />
<br />
The physics weren't that revolutionary as you suggest. In fact they are built around a engine, Havok, used in many games before then. Not to the same degree but then again I'm countering your argument because you keep skipping legit and logical points to fit your point of view. I actually do believe the physics were a major part. JUST like destructible environments will in Diablo 3. Just like the new mechanics for using multiple abilities in combination for Diablo 3. <br />
<br />
You wanted a different game. I'm sorry but they're giving you Diablo. What you wanted was some action RPG that Blizzard would never make under the Diablo series name. <br />
<br />
They're massively changing Battle.net. Maybe you don't recall but Battle.net is the reason why Diablo 2 was so popular. It simply needs to be upgraded which a major game release such as Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 have to introduce.<br />
<br />
Again, they wanted to retain the Diablo feel. Again, you wanted a entirely different game. You're looking to the wrong series.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see how they will acomplish large scale combat with only what 8 player controlled characters per game?<br />
<br />
<br />
It will won't it? I'm looking forward to this explanation. I think you should too. Will it happen today? Probably not, but then again this game isn't coming out in six months or likely a year. Much will be changed. The last half of development is the biggest part where actual GAMEPLAY is changed.</div></div><hr />

Suprise suprise, it's not. It's Diablo, the way that Diablo always has been and imo always should be.<br />
<br />
*Anecdote*<br />
<br />
Will never forget the time when i visited the US for the first time and bought D1 (i was 12-13 y.o. by then). It was fuxxing breathtaking even installing the game. And from there, it got even better. Good times. Thx Blizz. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
i think you misunderstood me, and called me a kiddo(about which i am not sure if this is just something like my &quot;dude&quot; or or &quot;guy&quot; or should be some kind of upgraded version of kiddy).<br />
<br />
no, i have NOT thought it would be a WoW with d2 classes(i have played d2 for what, 5 years? 7? 10? still play it sometimes with friends in lan). it's the other way round: i did not WANT IT to be, but as it turned out for me, it is not even as much as warcraft is. i liked hack&amp;slay and the only reason for me to actually start playing WoW back then was because it promised rpg aspects on an even wider range. as far as i have seen d3, it's nothing new, besides from the graphics which are already outdated. and yeah, i understand that they want to preserve the &quot;original feeling&quot; of the game, but hell man, can't be that they don't even TRY(as it looks like atm) to bring in anything new. for me it's like they stopped producing real new ideas with warcraft and just slightly enhance what they already have., &quot;milking&quot; as it's called. <br />
for me, it sucks that there's nothing new. 5 classes?(barb, sorc, necro, ama, pala, druid, assa) wtf. the graphics are already outdated with the game not even being in alpha stage(and yes i know d2 wasn't that great of an update back then, too). it's just for somebody who has played something as 'complex' as WoW, why would i wanna play d3? what for? download it and play it through in sp mode. you can't honestly tell me that there is such a difference in farming shit in warcraft and farming bosses or xp back in d2 now, can you?<br />

Some people guessed right, others guessed wrong. There's no way you could've logically derived or analyzed the previous splash images and be more than 50% certain it would've ended up as being a Diablo 3 announcement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
1. They wouldn't go far as making teaser splash for the already announced games.<br />
2. They wouldn't make multiple games under same franchise. (before releasing most recently announced one)<br />

The splash was completely unrelated to the announcement. It was a red herring, specifically designed to lead logical minds such as mine astray.

<br />
Maybe they were Tyrael's eyes. His shoulderpads have spikes too. And well, the last place we saw him was somewhere very cold (destroying the Worldstone).<br />
<br />
Those that are saying it's merely Diablo 2 with updated graphics must not be fond of Starcraft 2 either, because it's clearly doing the same thing. I see nothing wrong with them recapturing the feel of those truly epic games that I wasted many an hour playing back in the day. In fact, I'm quite giddy.</div></div><hr />

how do you know? how can you be so sure? <br />
I wouldn't say it's completely unrelated, you just don't know yet, it's too little information about the game to conclude it was unrelated. I doubt it's a diablo's face though (they wouldn't bring him back again right?), possibly a new final boss.</div></div><hr />

- People analyze splash page for meaning. A large number of people hope it's Diablo 3 and therefore pursue evidence of this. <br />
- A large number of skeptics insist on holding that not only does the evidence not conclusively point to Diablo 3, but that it is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, not Diablo 3. <br />
- Diablo 3 is announced.<br />
- Skeptics argue that they are not at fault because they had no way of knowing that it was going to be Diablo 3 and that people shouldn't jump to conclusions. <br />

Because that's what it was. If you can't see that with your own eyes, you're self-deluded or blind.<br />
<br />
I suspect the former, because it was so obvious even a blind person could see it. Although I guess that's the problem… it's so obvious that some people figure that couldn't possibly be it. Stop thinking so hard and just look at the splash pictures. Go here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath. Go look at the splash pictures again.<br />

<br />
Oh well, I've heard too many good things about diablo, might as well give this one a try</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spashscreentruther</div><div class="date">2008-06-28, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way to not get what I'm saying whatsoever. :)<br />
<br />
What they were showing wasn't misleading or a clever ruse, it was an outright lie. The splash screen had virtually no connection other than &quot;wow, the eyes are kind of glowing...and Diablo's eyes might glow too!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a retard. Seriously. The moment I saw the face start to appear, the first thing I thought was, well there it is, Diablo 3. I was shocked to see how stupid most people were. All of the evidence, the date being near the previous announcements, the face looking a lot like a demon, the 3 fingers on the evilpenguin, the picture of diablo wth 3 fingers in the picture on the building at the WWI event. Yeah, it could of been anything, if you're an idiot.<br />
<br />
Then at midnight when they updated again, added a freaking winking icon that was clearly winking right at and nearest to the diablo icon, I thought to myself, &quot;well they just basically announced it already&quot;. Again, I was shocked to find that most still didn't think it was going to be diablo. The face looked like nothing else but demonish.<br />
<br />
Add all of that with the fact that blizzard took over the diablo3.com domain and coming up with anything else was just silly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cluck</div><div class="date">2008-06-28, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhm, so.. Just one question. Did anyone really explain the evilpenguin, the numbers, the other runes or the signature? <br />
Yes, I still care.. We know it's diablo now and it looks awesome but I'm just curious if there was any meaning behind it :D<br />
Can't explain the penguin or the numbers, but for the two more mysterious runes check out page 13 of Cain's Journal on the Diablo III website. It has both the &quot;Pax Imperia&quot; rune and the &quot;Lost Vikings&quot; rune on the drawing there.</div></div><hr />

Wow, who's being an asshole now? Seriously. Everyone accuses me of being too dismissive but when I acknowledge it could've been anything but -I- thought it was the Lich King, you come in with LOL IF UR DUM.<br />

<br />
There were three Diablo icons. The &quot;planets&quot; and &quot;viking compass&quot; are, as the other poster claimed, Diablo runes. So no, the wink was not made to be a hint, because it could've been pointing at the other two regardless of that fact. In short, methinks it wasn't intentional. You can believe all you want.<br />
<br />

<br />
They did it last year's WWI. No Diablo 3. That was the reason for not caring about that.<br />
<br />
Done with you, buddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not your buddy, fri-&quot;<br />

DAMN YOU. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Your totems will affect the whole raid now, they are being moved to the physical school, and windfury will no longer be a weapon buff, and rather a buff (means you can put poisons on the weapon and still get it). Not to mention the change to your weapon spells...<br />
<br />
Not good enough ?<br />
<br />
Edit: IGN added an interview with Rob Pardo about the game, you guys may wanna read it... http://pc.ign.com/articles/885/885139p1.html<br />

<br />
Development on Diablo III began way back when Blizzard North was still around and currently the team working on it consists of around 50 people. Initially the game's visual design was closer to the older games than what we saw in the gameplay demonstration. &quot;We probably did three revisions on the visual direction until we got to this and now we're really happy with it,&quot; said Pardo.</div></div><hr />

exactly what i thought the whole time! ...it wasnt really hard to see...oh well ;) Its coming finally - im exited!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dayoandy</div><div class="date">2008-06-29, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it wasnt a teaser for one specific game at the end of the day, whatever anyone says. it got people talking about diablo and the new wow expansion (which i am sure is their main concern and priority at the minute and into the future) and more importantly, blizzard in general. therefore they achieved exactly what they wanted all along, not just for the specific purpose of saying they are making diablo 3, but more for both major games, and sc2. so i dont get why people think its good to say they guessed it was this and that, when in all reality, they probably read other peoples posts before hand.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ppower</div><div class="date">2008-06-29, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well now the fight between peeps with opinion what would the splash screen reveal is over :) Like many said it wasnt wotlk and what all thought it WAS Diablo 3</div></div><hr />

Imagine how much will occur in your life in the three years it will take for Diablo to ship. WoW might even end before that....</div></div><hr />

We'll see if anyone keeps their promised xD</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gnoop</div><div class="date">2008-06-30, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many people even like Diablo? I've met tons of people who play StarCraft and WarCraft but never one that played Diablo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I played Diablo but neither Starcraft or Warcraft. RTS, not my thing so much unless it's Rollercoaster Tycoon. Hell, my friend still plays Diablo with a 2 or 3 other people.<br />
<br />
I'm happy about the announcement, though. Diablo was due for an update.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Achillesx</div><div class="date">2008-06-30, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are people saying this game is bad? If u do think it is then no1 forces you to buy it so dont screw it up for the diablo fans. I have played diablo starcraft and warcraft. Doesn't mean im a major fan boy for one of the games trying to downgrade another. Well blizzard created a game what people wanted... we dont know how big this game is and if it is big then probably they will not be able to put in too much of the graphics. One reason for having this limited graphics could be a reason for letting everyone play this game for what you know is that not many people can afford the system requirements of a later generation CPU. What were you all expecting? HD graphics? Well look at the older diablo 2, there are graphic improvements the almost 2D game into a 3D game with enhanced dungeons and wait for all u know are those 2 classes but there is still more u know... Blizzard will slowly announce new classes and new data to us as we get closer to the release date. I know there are games which have much enhanced graphics on the pc itself though blizzard is more for the money and they know its an inelastic demand they would be expecting from the people since they loved the previous versions. I am not at all sad about it but some of you all have to high expectations and many are bound to be dissappointed since it didnt work out their way obviously. Diablo is based on the dungeon type and it wont change, on the contrary u all should be happy that it has not turned out to be some mmo grind game like wow is now. WoW has failed since the release of TBC. Now all i can hope is that the concept of PvP changes and the way game play works in WoW would be good. And btw this game releases at the end of this year:) 12/31/08 starcraft will release on 12/03/08 but WotLK is releasing in early november this year withing the first week for sure. If Diablo delays more than this then it would be a very bad idea and it would be very laid behind.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inside</div><div class="date">2008-06-30, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GG to diablo fans, you have what want...<br />
<br />
<br />
btw...<br />
<br />
<br />
When in about 2 years you'll get your new graphics on your 8 years old hack and slash, don't forget to take away all the kiddies and emoes from WoW, they'll love the Hell theme and the &quot;pwn 20 oppopnents by clicking like mad&quot; side of things.<br />
<br />
Now to the real news, want WotLK beta and SC2 release dates.<br />
<br />
<br />
And your post doesn't sound kiddish to you? Maybe you are the one who needs to leave WoW.<br />
<br />
Get over it. ::)<br />
<br />
wut?</div></div><hr />

This is an official image, not an elaborate PS.<br />
You sir, are fucking retarded. Keep being a fanboy, keep wishing it was an announcement about your game. Alas, Andorhal, you're wrong and won't admit it.<br />
<br />
<br />
This kinda maturity deserves a IP ban. Please continue so I have to listen to you less.<br />
<br />

Diablo shmelablo... It will be three years before the sucker ships.. (or perhaps before it enters beta...) SC II was announced last year and it still hasn't hit broad alpha testing yet...<br />

Exactly. Funny to see people talking about canceling subscriptions for a game that no one will touch for +2 years. Alot happens in that amount of time and hype will die.</div></div><hr />
