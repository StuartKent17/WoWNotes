<br />
Access to 5.0.1 PTR and Mists of Pandaria Beta<br />
Patch 5.0.1 is right around the corner on test realms! It also means that the release of MoP isn't too far either. <br />
We will soon begin public testing of patch 5.0.1 of World of Warcraft, a patch that will precede the Mists of Pandaria release, and includes many features and functions that are new to the game.<br />
<br />
We encourage all players who wish to test patch 5.0.1 with us to take careful note of the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
It will not be possible to access the 5.0.1 PTR realms with a game account that accesses the Mists of Pandaria Beta.<br />
If a game account has been flagged with a Mists of Pandaria Beta license, it can only be used to enter Beta realms.<br />
This limitation is on each World of Warcraft license, and is not Battle.net account-based.<br />
While testing 5.0.1, players will not be able to access zones or content that is a part of the Mists of Pandaria expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued support of our testing and tuning process. We look forward to seeing you in-game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the testing... Just because we have beta, means we can't test 5.0.1? Are they going to ADD that content to the beta so we can see it, or are we just going to get stuck missing out on testing content? Because that's kind of unfair. I'm an Annual Pass guy, and I've regretted buying it for months now. And then this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 months is not &quot;Right around the Corner.&quot; They wouldn't be announcing 5.1 coming to the PTR soon if it was 3 months away, I'd put it at a month tops, and even that seems too far away for an announcement. What'd I'd like to ask is how long is a pre-launch patch on the ptr before it goes live, if any reasonable average can be deduced from past events. We already know that release is about 2 weeks after 5.0 is released on Live, so with a little math here and there, maybe we can come up with a better estimate.<br />
<br />
So never mind, I realize he meant that the ptr stuff makes it onto live, as opposed to the ptr you know, coming out. Ignore my post</div></div><hr />

It's been well over a decade. Tons of movies, books, games, albums, everything, have been released on that date in the various years since.<br />

Maybe they wouldn't have released, oh, say, Cataclysm, with its trailer of a flying object destroying buildings, on that date (at least not anytime this century), but I think Mists is safe.</div></div><hr />

they have been in the past. <br />
in cata pre release patch ptr i was able to log on without being subbedWithout commenting on the starter edition accounts (no idea) I can say that being subbed to WoW at the time PTR is going on means nothing. Blizzard does &quot;screening of active accounts&quot; some time before they open PTR and if you are subbed at the time of the &quot;screening&quot; then you will have access to that PTR regardless of being subbed to live WoW while the PTR runs.<br />
<br />
This screening usually takes place anywhere from 1 day to 3 weeks before the PTR goes live.</div></div><hr />

What'd I'd like to ask is how long is a pre-launch patch on the ptr before it goes live, if any reasonable average can be deduced from past events. We already know that release is about 2 weeks after 5.0 is released on Live, so with a little math here and there, maybe we can come up with a better estimate.<br />
<br />
So never mind, I realize he meant that the ptr stuff makes it onto live, as opposed to the ptr you know, coming out. Ignore my post<br />

<br />
That's not the reason, they couldn't care less about that. <br />
<br />
It's all about hyping your product, you as a company have the date, but they people don't, so you keep giving them hints to keep them excited and talking about the product. If they gave you the date, there wouldn't be much of a hype, it would last a few weeks, but that's it. Why you think Apple doesn't announce their new products that much in time? To keep their costumers and outsiders hyped.</div></div><hr />

True, but very relevant to PR for the company. Blizzard wouldn't look too good in the public eye if people were anticipating that date for the release.<br />

The fact that the game may release on Sept. 11 is irrelevant. It's not even a federal holiday (although, in my eyes, it should be). Also, remember...Cataclysm came out on Pearl Harbor Day.</div></div><hr />

Cata released on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor. The only way 9/11 would ever be ruled out as a release date would be if it became a national holiday and even that's iffy. Movies come out on Christmas, 4th of July, etc when they have the opportunity. If we didn't release something on every day that held signiifcance somewhere, then nothing would get released because chances are every day has had something significant happen. I am an American and although I do see 9/11 as a day of moarning, we do have to move on. We can't just keep avoiding it like it never happened and we can't just keep holding it in stasis where nothing can happen more on that day. One of the steps to healing is to move on.<br />
<br />
At any rate, this is looking good for a late August or early September release. :D Really hoping we have time before Brewfest to hit 90 or we'll hear a LOT of complaints. Guess all of those people saying the game won't be out until November/December are now eating their hats. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You read it wrong. Read the very first line that says anyone with beta on their WoW license will not have access to the PTR.<br />
<br />
However, if you have more than one WoW license on your BNET account then you will get the PTR with it. By that I mean no starter edition, no PTR123, no beta license, nothing like that, basicly second separate WoW account that you paid for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree - I see 5.0.1 hitting live servers August 28 with Mists following on Sept. 11. Plus, Blizzard just announced a sale of the vanilla and previous expansions for only $10 each, ending on July 9th. Would make sense to end the sale, then announce on July 10 or 11 that MoP is releasing in two months. That way, they can sell the base software at full price and take advantage of the hype, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My bet is the release date is coming with the MoP cinematic reveal in August. As another poster was noting, Blizz likely has a date set up already, but it's all about hyping the game. Trailing out little breadcrumbs like PTR announcement, cinematic reveal, etc. keeps people excited.<br />
<br />
Additionally, revealing the cinematic and release date less than 2 weeks before GW2 launches will likely draw people away from the competition. Anyone bored with WoW at the moment and looking for something different to do might have been eyeballing GW2 as an option, but if MoP isn't too far behind, they'll be more likely to just wait rather than invest time in a new MMO for only 1-2 months.<br />
<br />
Blizz has an incredibly intelligent marketing team -- they proved that to me with Annual Pass. They know what they're doing.</div></div><hr />

Not quite, if they have the launch event on the 5.01 PTR... that was not on the Beta server(s).</div></div><hr />

Wrath was a little odd, info isn't as complete, but I show PTR went up Oct 4th, prep patch went live Oct 14th (there was likely another build before that that was up for approx a month), 2.0.1 went to the PTR Nov 8th, it went live Dec 7th. No prep patch for an expansion spent more than a month on the PTR.<br />
<br />
MoP should likely go live approx 6 weeks from the PTR server going up. 4weeks for the PTR, and a confirmed 2 weeks for the event prior to lauch. Give or take a week since they were working in non-absolutes, when they said 2 weeks for the event.</div></div><hr />

To me it just sounds that Blizzard doesn't want Beta players on PTR 'cause they will be &quot;full&quot; anyway and theres nothing on the PTR that isn't already on the beta. Why would any beta player even want to log on to PTR?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Release date right after $10 vanilla/exp sale ends next week - would make sense...2 months prior to go-live. <br />
Cinematic mid-August - already announced.<br />
5.0 live late August - a week or 2 after cinematic, keeping with what they've done in the past. Also counters the GW2 release a bit.<br />
MoP release Sept 11 or 18 (or at least those weeks) - In-line with past beta times, and also since they've said the pre-event would only be 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
Starting to form a fairly clear picture. But it will be nice once it's official and Blizz saves us from having to piece together the puzzle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel like the PTR will be available for about 3 weeks to work out bugs, due to all the QQ on no content until Pandaria is live. 5.0.1 (If the special features include Pet Battles and not just new talents), then it will hit live servers, and we will expect to see Pandaria at the end of August or early September. Even new features would occupy me until Pandaria comes out so I can learn my toons again before 90.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that. They still play sporting events on September 11th. If it falls on a Friday, movies are released. The world doesn't come to a stand still. I think you overestimate the percentage of the population that would care if it were released on the 11th. A game release is in no way an insensitive thing to do on September 11th.</div></div><hr />

This. And if they ARE overly concerned with it, they can release it on the 13th - a Thursday, just like Wrath.<br />

You would end up testing what is already available on Beta, so there is no real point anyway<br />
Sure there is. I'd love to try things out in PvP with my arena partners before the patch goes live, but this is not going to happen because I have beta access and they don't. /sadface</div></div><hr />

Early September, maybe the first or second week.<br />
<br />
<br />
if 5.0.1 goes on PTR today, we'll &quot;test&quot; it for a month, then 5.0.1 will go to Live servers. Once 5.0.1 goes to Live servers, its about a month after that before the Expansion goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because you can't race/faction change in the beta =/<br />
<br />
Also i just realized that people with beta CAN acsess it they just can't use the &quot;WoW 2&quot; (Or whatever you use for your beta) you gotta use the drop down menu to click &quot;WoW 1&quot;.<br />
No, you can't. If the WoW account is flagged for beta, you cannot access the PTR. &quot;WoW 1&quot; or &quot;WoW 2&quot; -- those are not accounts, just sub-categories within a single World of Warcraft license. Now if a person has another WoW license on the same Battle.Net account that is not flagged for beta, then that separate license (aka account) can log into the PTR.<br />
<br />
And here's an earlier post basically stating the same thing:<br />
<br />
You read it wrong. Read the very first line that says anyone with beta on their WoW license will not have access to the PTR.<br />
<br />
However, if you have more than one WoW license on your BNET account then you will get the PTR with it. By that I mean no starter edition, no PTR123, no beta license, nothing like that, basicly second separate WoW account that you paid for.<br />
<br />
<br />
One statement I would also like to make: I'm tired of conspiracy theories involving Blizzard doing A, B, or C due to game/company X, Y, or Z. I'm all for having some fun with guessing the release date (early to mid-September, imo), but jeez... Give it a rest with all this Guild Wars 2 stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the testing... Just because we have beta, means we can't test 5.0.1? Are they going to ADD that content to the beta so we can see it, or are we just going to get stuck missing out on testing content? Because that's kind of unfair. I'm an Annual Pass guy, and I've regretted buying it for months now. And then this?<br />

As has already been brought up multiple times, unless you canceled a very very long time ago, you can access the PTRs with a frozen wow account, you don't have to be subbed.<br />

The beta has everything that'll be in 5.0.1, plus more. I don't know why someone with a beta account would want access to the PTR when they already have the ability to test all of that stuff on the beta.<br />
<br />
Maybe they specifically want feedback on 5.0.1 from people who haven't played the beta.</div></div><hr />

&quot;If you didn't get into the beta by signing up to the annual pass, you can still get into a version of the beta which we will call PTR.&quot;<br />

I'm sorry you are new to gaming but companies offer pre orders with just a title available. And they will offer CE pre orders as well (in stores not online). <br />

Blizzard always releases CE. Game retailers know this...</div></div><hr />

Re-read my post again with that in mind and you will see what my true point was.<br />
<br />
No, we got beta so the people who didn't get beta get to test PTR, its a good return I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) August 28/Sept 4 to give time for people to get close to 90 so they can enjoy the &quot;holiday&quot; with the 4th being a good bet so that MOP will drop on the 18th, right before the &quot;holiday&quot;<br />
or<br />
2) Sept 18 to incorporate the &quot;holiday&quot; into the pre-expansion and having MOP drop two weeks later.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why someone with a beta account would want access to the PTR when they already have the ability to test all of that stuff on the beta.<br />
<br />
Maybe they specifically want feedback on 5.0.1 from people who haven't played the beta.<br />
Who knows? /shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
As has already been brought up multiple times, unless you canceled a very very long time ago, you can access the PTRs with a frozen wow account, you don't have to be subbed.<br />
<br />
The sale is clearly to offer the newly released The Secret World some competition.<br />
Speaking of that title, the only reason I've heard of it is because Curse decided to play it cute by altering my addon client's theme for the duration of its advertising. Very annoying.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought the updated models were supposed to be after MoP... not on release...</div></div><hr />

Releasing in November would be very bad for their subscription numbers. The longer they wait, the more people that will quit (at least temporarily) because of boredom.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Declaron</div><div class="date">2012-07-04, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok my 2 cents...<br />
<br />
You all seem to be referring to previous releases as if there is some sort of stone with commandments carved in it somewhere, &quot;Thou shalt not release the game until ptr has been up at least x days&quot;, &quot;Thou shalt not release games on certain dates&quot;, the fact of the matter is blizzard will release it when they are absolutely certain its ready, they have always done this up until Diablo 3, and look at how horrifically wrong that went (and still is), they won't release MoP until basically everything apart from the T14 end bosses has been tested, it doesnt matter how long the ptr has been up or whatever.<br />
<br />
The other thing is it seems that the vast majority of people dont understand the top post. Im going to explain this with the use of quotes and logic.<br />
<br />
&quot;This limitation is on each World of Warcraft license, and is not Battle.net account-based.&quot;<br />
You have a battle.net account, within your account you have various game licenses, if you bought the Annual Pass, you will have a mists of pandaria beta game license, this license allows you access to the beta client, and beta servers. You also have your normal account which allows you access to wow, and wow PTR, along with Diablo 3, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will not be possible to access the 5.0.1 PTR realms with a game account that accesses the Mists of Pandaria Beta.<br />
If a game account has been flagged with a Mists of Pandaria Beta license, it can only be used to enter Beta realms.&quot;<br />
This means that you cannot play on the PTR with any of the characters you have on the Beta license, so for example, if you have copied your main over to the beta, levelled it up to 90 and are testing the new shiz, you cant use that character to test cata content with the new talents system etc on the ptr, but you can on the beta.<br />
<br />
Likewise, if you DO NOT HAVE the annual pass, you also do not have the beta, so you CAN access the PTR and you CAN test the new talents system, everyone can do this, but you cannot do it with any of the characters you have on your beta license. You will need to copy any chars you wish from the live wow over to the ptr, then test it on there.<br />
<br />
&quot;While testing 5.0.1, players will not be able to access zones or content that is a part of the Mists of Pandaria expansion.&quot;<br />
Of course you cant, you really think after some people had to wait 2 months to access the mists content on beta they would then let everyone, even the non-ap holders access to all of it? get real.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flat out wrong.<br />
<br />
The PTR is testing the 5.0.1 patch. Which means they'll be testing the pre-expansion event. You can't do that on beta.</div></div><hr />

Well, maybe you don't understand but places that do pre-orders such as Gamestop or Best Buy will not offer a pre-order on anything that isn't available on their website (even in-store) especially a CE because they need a head-start to know how many units they can sell from Blizzard so they don't screw themselves and oversell. Also, yes they didn't announce official street date for Cataclysm until October 12, 2010 a full 2+ Months after the CE was available for pre-oreder from both Gamestop and Best Buy on July 21, 2010. My point is, to date, there still isn't an available pre-order for the CE anywhere which at least for Cataclysm was 2+ months before they announced a release date which was then for another 2 months down the line on December 7th.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this. I am amazed at how many people think this is a beta free for all. No...sorry kiddies...wrong. Theramore and talents....no pandas...no awesome scenerie...no nothing else. Same stuffs basically as live..couple extra goodies and that's it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hiragi</div><div class="date">2012-07-04, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So nobody with the annual pass can go on the PTR..? D:<br />
<br />
no you just fail at reading, it says the test account, not battlenet, so if you have a WoW1 and WoW2 account when you try to log in you chose most likely the first one since that'll be your PTR acc, the WoW2 is prolly MOP since most likely people have had a PTR acc way before a beta acc, so you'll just choose WoW1 if you're already on annual pass unless you've never ptr'd prior to getting it, if you haven't then you more than likely have to choose WoW2<br />
<br />
TL;DR you fail at reading and no one on beta will be restricted from ptr cause its just plain STUPID</div></div><hr />

Does not really matter how much get as long as it is new since the game has been utterly boring in the last few months.<br />

Maybe this is dumb question but does this mean, like in every other pre-exp patch , we get new talents ?</div></div><hr />

Not that i'm personally really bothered about it.. just struck me as odd :o<br />

After paying for what? Your subs don't entitle you to beta or PTR access as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

What its stating is that you can't use the WoW account that was created for you to access the beta and you'll have to use another one for the normal PTR. Those that have been on the normal PTR realms before will already have one. Those who haven't can easily make one. When you both types, both accounts will show up in the PTR and beta clients but the PTR account will always go to the PTR realms and the beta one will always go to the beta realms irregardless of which client you use.<br />
<br />
They should have just stated that those with beta access will need to make sure they have a normal PTR account set up as the beta one won't work for it.</div></div><hr />

As it takes place in Kal/EK - the only significant changes to those continents were the Pandaren NPCs in the capitals (and maybe some out in the wild, though I only heard of that in pre-beta previews) though I even believe that unlike Cata, but like WotLK and BC, the world will already be in &quot;Mists mode&quot; with 5.0, we're just without access to expansion content until it is released.</div></div><hr />

2 Seperate testing options - dont get all excited too much as you wont be rolling level 1 Pandas in the PTR - you will get to see all the new spells and changes but not what they are seeing on the BETA servers.</div></div><hr />
