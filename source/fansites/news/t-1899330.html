Patch 6.2.3 Overview<br />
During scheduled maintenance on Tuesday, November 17, we’ll release Patch 6.2.3, bringing cross-realm Mythic raiding, new Timewalking dungeons, the return of the Valor currency, the Grove Warden mount, and more to the game.<br />
<br />
Tuesday’s maintenance period will also mark the end of the current PvP season and the beginning of Warlords Season 3. In the new season, you’ll have a chance to earn new PvP gear, including the Warmongering Aspirant (PvP item level 715), Warmongering Combatant (ilvl 730), and Warmongering Gladiator (ilvl 740) sets.<br />
<br />
For those interested in diving into dungeons, the very first Cataclysm Timewalking Bonus Event begins Wednesday, November 18, featuring Grim Batol, Stonecore, Lost City of Tol’vir, Vortex Pinnacle, Throne of Tides, and End Time. We’re also expanding the Northrend Timewalking Bonus Event to include Pit of Saron and The Burning Crusade Timewalking Bonus Event to include Magister’s Terrace.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2.3 Official Notes<br />
New Timewalking Dungeons<br />
<br />
A new Cataclysm Timewalking Bonus Event has been added to the holiday rotation, featuring the following dungeons:<br />
<br />
End Time<br />
Grim Batol<br />
Lost City of Tol’vir<br />
Stonecore<br />
The Vortex Pinnacle<br />
Throne of Tides<br />
<br />
The existing Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King Timewalking events have been expanded to include an additional dungeon each:<br />
<br />
Magister’s Terrace (Burning Crusade)<br />
Pit of Saron (Wrath of the Lich King)<br />
<br />
New rare mount: Infinite Timereaver, has been added as a random drop from any Timewalking boss.<br />
Added a vendor near the Cataclysm portals in Stormwind and Orgrimmar during the Cataclysm Timewalking Bonus Event that sells modernized Cataclysm gear and cool new toys.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cross-Realm Mythic Raiding<br />
<br />
Cross-Realm raiding has been enabled for Hellfire Citadel on Mythic difficulty. You’ll now be able to join with friends or fill that last raid spot to take on the most difficult encounters in Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Upgrades and Valor are back!<br />
<br />
Item upgrades are back! Players will be able to earn and spend Valor to upgrade items from Hellfire Citadel, crafted profession items, items created from Baleful tokens in Tanaan Jungle, and all Draenor dungeon drops. All the items you’ve already earned are eligible for upgrades retroactively.<br />
Characters can earn Valor in a number of ways.<br />
<br />
Completing the first random Heroic Dungeon of the day<br />
Completing Mythic Dungeons<br />
Completing weekly Bonus Event quests (except for the Pet Battle Bonus Event)<br />
Completing a Raid Finder wing for Highmaul, Blackrock Foundry, or Hellfire Citadel for the first time each week.<br />
<br />
To upgrade, visit your friendly neighborhood ethereal in Orgrimmar and Stormwind, or Stormshield and Warspear to upgrade your gear by 5 item levels at a time for 250 Valor, up to twice per item, for a total potential boost of 10 item levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Item Rewards<br />
Mythic Dungeon Loot Improvements<br />
<br />
Mythic Dungeons now have a chance to award items ranging from item level 685 to 725 in 5-item-level increments, with a progressively lower chance as item level increases.<br />
Mythic Dungeon bosses now also have a chance to drop a new Heirloom Trinket that will scale up to level 110.<br />
<br />
Baleful Item Level Boost<br />
<br />
Baleful items now have a chance to create items ranging in quality from item level 655 to 695 in 5-item-level increments, with a progressively lower chance as item level increases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords Season 3<br />
<br />
Around the release of Patch 6.2.3, a transition to Warlords Season 3 will take place. More information and details on the close of Warlords Season 2 and transition to the new season will be available in the future.<br />
With the new season comes new gear. New Warmongering Aspirant gear scales up to PvP item level 715, Warmongering Combatant gear scales to 730, and Warmongering Gladiator gear scales to 740.<br />

Gnome Hunters make sense.<br />
<br />
Undead Paladins would still be the worst possible Race/Class Combination possible in WoW and I severely hope they never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever do it.</div></div><hr />

Horde isn't getting anything new. The allies were one short on the race/class combo list, 57 to 58 (pre DH). Adding gnome hunters tied it up.</div></div><hr />

I still hate the fact that Tauren and (to a slightly lesser extent) Blood Elves can be paladins.<br />
<br />
That having been said, I think undead paladins would be neat. Wielding the Light as an Undead is meant to be agony. Enduring constant pain so that one can continue serving as a weapon of righteousness (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCr7y4SLhck) even after death is right up the Paladin's alley.</div></div><hr />

Orc Priests - Only race that cant be priests ???<br />
<br />
Draenei Demon Hunters - The Eredar race split into two, the Holy Draenei and the Fel Man'ari (they kept the name Eredar in the divorce), factor also the Draenei got corrupted by Fel Energy becoming the Broken and eventually the Ashtongue Broken served Illidan at the Black Temple. I would like to think Illy experimented with the idea of turning Draenei/Broken into Eredar like Demonhunters for his side. Would love Draenei demon hunters and the character models could include Broken and Eredar features/skin tones imo.</div></div><hr />

There's a small lore thing in Light's Hope I think of an undead paladin. Basically the light burns him/her (I'm not sure if this is true either) and is learning to control it so they one day can teach it to other undead. TBH undead or paladins aren't really my lore speciality so I can't confirm this.</div></div><hr />

Yeah makes you wonder people have been for ages asking why don't we have Gnome Hunters and Blizzard has replied &quot;Here you go Gnome Hunters.&quot; And all of a sudden there is a whinge fest from players going off like 2 year olds. Really makes you wonder about some people, as it seems Blizzard have listened to what the players wanted they give it to them then the players whinge about getting it, really Blizzard can not win at all..</div></div><hr />

Well, Cataclysm was another 'give them what they want' expansion. More class/race combos, flying in Azeroth, Hyjal, Grim Batol, Uldum...<br />
<br />
We know how that turned out. (I liked it but many didn't).<br />
<br />
Thing is while 2 times doesn't make a pattern we've gone expansion, expansion, &quot;give them what they want expansion&quot;, expansion, expansion, &quot;give them what they want expansion&quot;.<br />

So when do you want them to release content? Really I can not understand people like this^ people whinge when they release stuff too early, people whinge when they release stuff too late. Be lucky they are releasing anything at all and I find it funny how people go how dare they release content during a holiday period. <br />
<br />
Seems some people need to be reminded that not all of the playerbase celebrate what is essentially a US only holiday so those that don't need to have something to do.</div></div><hr />

Gnome's military consisted mainly out of ranged units and fire power, and they're the best engineers in the Alliance, producing the best firearms. It was very annoying for all these reasons that they could not use guns at all.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I'm not one to complain about Blizzard implementing something that's been requested. I don't really have a problem at all with new class/race combos as long as time has passed and it's viable for the race in question to have learned how to be the new class. I'm fine with human druids or undead paladins, they've been around other races long enough they could learn a thing or two. Undead druids or Draenei warlocks are a little more out there, though, for example. But as we can see with DKs and DHs, player classes don't always have to be a 'common' calling; there are canonically only a small number of DKs and DHs. Particularly DHs, I think there are only 10-20, if that, going by what we've seen of the DH experience.</div></div><hr />

How are you forced to run timewalking? (if thats the outdated dungeons thing you mean) There are other alternatives. As for the nerf it happens every xpac since Wrath as far as I know.

The LAST thing we need are more Blood Elves in this game. They're already the most played Horde race and that's only going to spike even higher with them being the only playable Demon Hunters along with Night Elves. We don't need the Horde to be 99% barbie doll female blood elves.<br />

They keep adding more features for Legion because the numbers continue to slide. They will likely add much more. BE druids. UD paladins. Solo grinds for Valor. SWtoR has added a way to solo flash points (dungeons). I wouldn't be surprised to see WoW do something similar. They have a bit of time before the expansion drops, so there may likely be more announcements like this in the coming months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is that SWTOR's latest expansion was designed as mostly singleplayer and story in mind. Where as WoW's dungeons rarely tell that great stories to begin with, the flashpoints do tell a story and the events that happen in those events are part of the major storyline in the game.<br />
<br />
I can't see WoW adding solo dungeons, people do dungeons for gear not for the story. There's a reason the flashpoints are &quot;Story mode&quot; and &quot;Hardmode&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Horde ain't getting a new class/race combo unless Alliance gets another one. Gnome Hunter fixed the imbalance between Ally/Horde class choices (Horde had 1 more than ally).

<br />
But honestly, before Orc Priests they should enable Goblin / Worgen Monks, no reason every other race can be 1 except them. It's just laziness of Blizzard because they'd have to rework those races starting zones to incorporate Monk trainers. Somehow we have Worgens being druids even before they met Night Elves, and Goblins having Warrior trainer in a form of a target dummy, so really, if they wanted to implement something they'd find a way. <br />
<br />
Shamans, Druids, Paladins and Warlocks are classes that historically weren't available to many and often required lore reasons for a race to be one. Warriors, Rogues, Hunters and to some extent Priests, Monks and Death Knights didn't have this exclusivity in it. Every race needed infantry, recon / spy units, ranged sharpshooters and medics in their army. And Dks... well Scourge takes everyone.</div></div><hr />

I don't think Draenei would have rogues because they probably fear tampering with shadow magic might cause them to be unbroken again. Trolls are more nature than light wielders. Worgen technically come from their own homeworld so im guessing that was all dark too so anything regarding the light would cause them harm. Monk maybe as chi is spirit and spirit can be in nature hence the druids. Goblin monk should be in as gnomes are monks but cos of MoP being the resent expantion they already said they didnt want to give them everything right away. And again Night elf paladins will be a no due to having affinity with nature not the light.<br />

That having been said, I think undead paladins would be neat. Wielding the Light as an Undead is meant to be agony. Enduring constant pain so that one can continue serving as a weapon of righteousness (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCr7y4SLhck) even after death is right up the Paladin's alley.<br />
<br />
Agreed I've always thought this. I really dig the idea of the truly penitent/flagellant Paladin as the undead Pally. Not sure. I think before long most race class combos will open. Sticking with a live world it is only right that after time new races would integrate into new classes. Learn new things as we all intermix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because it never made sense that they couldn't be. After all they essentially invented firearms in Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Dwarves could be hunters it made no sense that Gnomes could not. And now that Undead and Goblins can be it was asinine that they could not.</div></div><hr />

Shadow magic and rogue? What? I think you mean Warlocks. there are Draenei Rogue NPCS in WoW. Misha was the start of it, now WOD introduce the Rangari into the mix and there are confirmed rogues in that part of Draenei forces.<br />
<br />
Troll Paladins exist we've seen them in game already, and it can be easily explained like Troll druids, There can be a Loa of the Light.<br />
<br />
Worgens are never from another world, they are originally Nightelf Druids that gave in to the Wolf form that we know as Worgens that were banished into the emerald dream before they caused further harm.<br />
<br />
Didn't stop them from making the Sunwalkers, what would stop them from having an order of sentinels that worship the Moon's Light?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes shadow magic and rogue, read the lore and the latest class build,it states that sub rogues employ shadow magic to their needs to bolster their powers.<br />
<br />
And yes Worgens are originally from another world as stated multiple times in the book of arugal, the wolf form the druids gave in to were in fact these wolf like beings from another planet or dimension. The shadowfang keep quest line used to have all the information about it back when worgen were a rare site and had different models. Trust me i did a lot of nerdy reading up on the lore of worgens many years ago before they became &quot;cool&quot;.</div></div><hr />

That's only one spec. Then we have assassins that are about bleeds and poisons and outlaws / combat that are about toe to toe combat / duelling and those are non magical, just a more nimble warrior. In that same way Forsaken can be priests even though lore wise they're all shadow, but in game they can be holy / disc as well and no one sees it as weird because they existed since vanilla.</div></div><hr />

I've got 2 weeks of game time left from a 6 month sub. Might pop on and check tbh because I thought some of the Cata dungeons were cool. The Hour of Twilight ones especially. It's a shame the Zul dungeons aren't part of the rotation though.</div></div><hr />

Though when you inspect the lore closely it wouldn't be difficult to see that Night Elves and Undead could easily become paladins: Night Elves for Draenei intervention, and undead, well; they can be priests, so mastering the holy magic shouldn't be a bothersome problem at all. On the other hand, I believe Draenei and Blood Elf druids should be added to the game by now. The lore allows it: There are Blood Elf druids in the lore already. And everything I say here, I believe makes more sense than Gnome hunters.</div></div><hr />

The hunter class is a basic range class that does not have anything exclusive about it. Exclusive being an affinity to something like the light or nature like a paladin or druid. You pick up a bow, tame a pet of any size and then go kill shit. If you think gnome hunters are dumb then you might as well say gnome anything is dumb. I mean, they are warriors and rogues after all. Although their size does make good for being a rogue.</div></div><hr />

You're are Paladin Purist and I'm a person who goes by lore. To hell with your beliefs as it's complete bullshit. Before you were a Paladin Purist it was already written in print long before your fanaticism of paladins that blood elves became paladins and called themselves Blood Knights.

There's a small lore thing in Light's Hope I think of an undead paladin. Basically the light burns him/her (I'm not sure if this is true either) and is learning to control it so they one day can teach it to other undead. TBH undead or paladins aren't really my lore speciality so I can't confirm this.<br />
<br />
Undead may be priests, no? I never understood a race that could wield the light as a priest, but somehow, a paladin was a no go, since they're just priests w/ plate.</div></div><hr />
