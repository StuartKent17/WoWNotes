We’re pleased to announce four new books coming to stores this fall. Whether you’re into Hearthstone, Diablo, or World of Warcraft (or all the above), there’s something special waiting for you within the pages of these collectible volumes.<br />
<br />
The Art of Hearthstone: Year of the Kraken<br />
Something stirs in the dark . . . <br />
<br />
The second volume of The Art of Hearthstone dives deep into the Year of the Kraken, the first year of Hearthstone’s standard format. Enjoy 144 pages consisting of hundreds of illustrations from the corruptive cults of Whispers of the Old Gods, the glamourous disco of One Night in Karazhan, and the turf wars of Means Streets of Gadgetzan. Year of the Kraken goes into detail on the Hearthstone team’s artistic process for card art, game boards, and other visual designs, while also exploring the challenges and triumphs of creating a game enjoyed by millions of players around the globe.<br />
<br />
Purchase the first volume today on the Blizzard Gear Store (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/games/hearthstone/art-of-hearthstone?blzcmp=blizzard-news) or at your favorite local bookstore.<br />
<br />
The Art of Diablo<br />
For more than 20 years, the artists behind Diablo have conjured new visions of the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, built nightmarish corridors filled with monsters and demons, and unleashed swarms of malevolent creatures upon players worldwide. The Art of Diablo plunges into the concept, design, and environmental art that has defined the world of Sanctuary and the Eternal Conflict at the core of the Diablo series.<br />
<br />
The Cinematic Art of World of Warcraft<br />
The drums of war thunder once again . . .<br />
<br />
Over the course of World of Warcraft’s 15-year history, each new chapter in the game’s story has been bolstered through an array of epic cinematics; The Cinematic Art of World of Warcraft goes behind the scenes with the team who built these movies. With never-before-seen concept art and accounts of the creative and technical process, this is the definitive visual gallery of how countless artists helped bring the world of Azeroth to life in incredible detail and motion.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Pop-Up Book<br />
Choose your faction, pick your weapon, and prepare for an astonishing vision of the world of Azeroth like you’ve never seen before!<br />
<br />
Built by best-selling paper engineer Matthew Reinhart, the World of Warcraft Pop-Up Book brings the beloved locations of Warcraft to life, from the classic faction hubs of Orgrimmar and Stormwind, to the battle-scarred lands of Lordaeron and Teldrassil, and even the new capital cities of Kul Tiras and Zandalar!<br />
<br />
Each page unfolds into an eye-popping treat, depicting iconic sites with brand-new art and interactive pieces.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye on your local booksellers or online shops for when pre-sales go live.</div></div><hr />

They did fix it, in 8.2 there is a complete rework coming to the hearth of azeroth that makes it like the artifact weapons of legion and is spec specific...lol, and the azerite armor will remain largely the same as in 8.1</div></div><hr />

Sure, sure, and there's also such as thing as objectively good science fiction/fantasy out there, agreed upon by all as well worth money and time spent.<br />

The wow catalog of books is objectively worse than real science fiction/fantasy. Though I can understand why it appeals to you, if you're unable to see that statement and the one following it are seperate. To explain it: Crap is easily churned out.<br />
<br />
You mean like lord of the rings with its horrible cringe moments and &quot;but why not just ride the eagles?&quot;<br />
or star wars with constant retcons, jar jar binks, and many other nonsense like fart fetish writing?<br />
harry potter with &quot;Oh yeah one of our main charecters was black, even though i mentioned their white skin many times before, she was always black.&quot;</div></div><hr />

These artists studdied their whole life to create something for you to enjoy. Something hopefully you will understand one day. To be able to show off your work to the whole world is the best thing every artist can hope. To be a part of a team that create a whole world. To be appreciated after your long hard working journey. <br />
Support those people!! They are the ones who create those worlds FOR YOU! Learn their names! Buy their work. Because you all know how great Arhas and Frostmourne looked! You know the chills you got when Illidan holding Gul'dan skull jumped and shouted &quot;You are not prepared&quot;. Dont be another mindless troll on the board of the hatetrain. I know blizzard did tons of mistakes and slowly lead our game towards a cliff.. And i dont like that. I realy hope BFA and future of wow will become better. But as an artist... please dont direct ur hatred towards the people who sole purpose is to make the world you live in more cool and beautiful. Cashgrab or not... this is not about Blizzard or Activision. I would gladly support my fellow collegues and buy their amazing art books.</div></div><hr />
