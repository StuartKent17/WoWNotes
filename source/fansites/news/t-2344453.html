<br />
<br />
Why are They Different?<br />
While the basic skeleton model for each of these races resemble existing ones, each race will have unique customizations and racials.<br />
<br />
<br />
More in the Future<br />
While there are only 6 Allied Races to start, there are more planned in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
How to Unlock<br />
Allied Races are unlocked via preliminary requirements that lead to a quest chain done on your main character to bring the race into your faction. Once completed, the Allied Race will be available in the character creation options account-wide. Preliminary requirements can include becoming exalted with the Allied Race’s faction from previous expansions such as Highmountain or the Nightborne.<br />
<br />
<br />
What Level/Where do They Start At?<br />
Allied Races begin their journey at level 20. The current plan is for them to start in the main hub of their respective faction (Orgrimmar and Stormwind) and level wherever they see fit within the new old world scaling technology.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level Boost/Race Change<br />
You are able to level boost and race change to an Allied Race once it is unlocked on your account.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;h3&gt;Heritage Armor&lt;/h3&gt;After you unlock an Allied Race, leveling one to level cap will unlock a race restricted armor transmog unique to that race. This must be done by actually leveling and not through level boosting or race changing. These transmogs are armor agnostic, meaning they can be transmogged on any type of armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction Embassies<br />
In the BlizzCon demo, Stormwind and Orgrimmar each had a new building that served as a hub for recruiting their Allied Races. The quests to unlock each race was given out in a manner similar to your artifact weapon acquisition.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;h3&gt;Alliance Races&lt;/h3&gt;Alliance players will have access to the Dark Iron Dwarves, Lightforged Draenei, and Void Elves. <br />
<br />
Dark Iron Dwarves: Led by Magni Bronzebeard’s (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magni_Bronzebeard) daughter Moira Thauissan (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Moira_Thaurissan), the Dark Iron Dwarves are known for their dark skin and fiery features. The clan has resided mostly in the Blackrock Mountains until the death of their previous ruler, Dagran Thaurissan (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dagran_Thaurissan).Their relationship with the Alliance has been rocky at best, but with Moira joining Ironforge’s Council of Three Hammers (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Council_of_Three_Hammers), the Dark Iron Clan is slowly finding a place within its ranks.<br />

With their main purpose fulfilled, the Lightforged Draenei have joined their brethren in the Alliance to counter Horde aggression.<br />

When the Legion came, the leaders of their race made a pact that created civil war. Now liberated, the Nightborne have found common ground with the Horde and plan to fight for them.<br />

Death Knights start in WOTLK timeline, the playable DK's are created by Arthas. Void Elves didn't exist, Nightborne were inside a bubble, Highmountain didn't even meet the Kalimdor Tauren yet, Zandalari were plotting their vengeance from Zandalar, Lightforged were still on Xenedar in Twisting Nether. Why would you expect any of them to be Death Knights? They aren't gonna redesign the whole DK starting zone just because of them, Dark Iron Dwarves are the only ones that would somewhat make sense and they said they're thinking about allowing them to be DK's.</div></div><hr />

Nothing has touched Diplomacy. Diplomacy reigns supreme in broken-ness and is untouchable and out of place in current WoW.<br />
And I say that as an alliance player who has benefitted from it since day one. It's broken, and needs to go. THEN we can talk about any other racial being broken.</div></div><hr />

Void Elves didn't exist, Nightborne were inside a bubble, Highmountain didn't even meet the Kalimdor Tauren yet, Zandalari were plotting their vengeance from Zandalar, Lightforged were still on Xenedar in Twisting Nether. Why would you expect any of them to be Death Knights? They aren't gonna redesign the whole DK starting zone just because of them, Dark Iron Dwarves are the only ones that would somewhat make sense and they said they're thinking about allowing them to be DK's.<br />
<br />
It's not like Blizzard would give a damn about this if they wanted to make DKs avaliable to those races. <br />
<br />
Whoever tries to keep up with wow lore is no stranger to radical retcons and sudden half-baked excuses for the sake of game mechanics. <br />
<br />
The 'Void Elves' themselves an example.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to have DKs, they could just toss in Bolvar to raise them. Easy as pie. <br />
They won't do it because it would require more work (like a somewhat different introdutory questline). Not because of lore.</div></div><hr />

The Ebon Blade can't raise Death Knights. Only the Lich King can. In the Death Knight class quest, Bolvar raised his new horsemen through the artifact of your Death Knight.<br />
<br />
If you paid attention to the WotLK lore, specifically the Grizzly Hills stuff, you would know why the Worgen make perfect sense as a Death Knight race.<br />
<br />
Adoxe is right. The only allied race that are even possible to be Death Knights are the Dark Iron. All the others have valid lore reasons, just like the Pandaren, for why they can't be Death Knights.</div></div><hr />

Unlock the armor for X race. All characters of X race can wear that armor regardless of armor type.<br />

Same thing with the Dark Irons. Not all of them are loyal to Moira.<br />
<br />
The Blood Elves are more appealing to them as they have a common problem; they're both meth elves.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, charge stun for pvp, flat damage reduction that if you were a warrior with how the prot system works could mean you take even less damage through your rage shield. Versatility is a decent tank stat and really extra food mats means easier cooking or more gold generation via the AH. Faster mining means quicker JC/BS/ENG ore gathering, or you can use him just to farm ore to sell. To be fair that means HM tauren get 2 bonuses to gathering raw materials and thats huge!</div></div><hr />

<br />
High Elves are Blood Elves, there is no difference and using the terms separately doesn't make sense. When the Sunwell was corrupted all the &quot;High&quot; Elves of Azeroth fell under the same affliction and the hunger for magic hit all of them from Archers to Master Magi. The Sin'dorei or children of the blood is the name giving to the survivors of the Scourging of Quel'Thalas. So again All the &quot;high&quot; Elves are &quot;blood&quot; elves there is no difference.<br />
<br />
The Void Elves were banished for their tampering with the void, it makes sense now that Alliera is all voided out that they would seek her out, for acceptance and to help them control it. There is no way she would leave Turalyon and with the Army of the Light joining the Alliance or a least a some/most of it, it makes sense they would join the Alliance. *On a side note the loyalty of the Highborn have always been in question for their entire existence, they only care for themselves so again switching sides is very lore friendly.*<br />
<br />
The lore here is 100% solid but I do understand what you're saying and for me, it's clear what Blizzard is doing. Since Elves are the most popular race by far in wow and combined I think the Elves make up almost the player base. By giving the Horde Night Elves and the Alliance Blood Elves it looks like there are trying to balance the sides in some way.<br />

3. Are we seriously stuck with a plate set for Dark Irons and a cloth set for Nightborne? Especially the Nightborne, dude. Their race has the best aesthetic in the game, and we're only going to get ONE set ported for them? For real?<br />

Read the post, it says it can be mogged to any armour type.<br />
<br />
You both misunderstood me. I'm saying that if you're a Nightborne, the &quot;Heritage&quot; set you unlock is a cloth-looking set. The Nightborne have ASSLOADS of gear in-game. Off the top of my head, the Nightborne have models that could have easily been used for Cloth, Leather, and Plate -- I wasn't really paying attention for a mail set, but I'm sure something could be scrounged up even if it didn't exist. Instead, if I'm a Warrior, I'll use a cloth set. If I'm a rogue, I'll use the cloth set. If I'm a hunter, I'm stuck with the cloth set. That's terrible. It also makes NO mention of weapons, which there are plenty of Nightborne exclusive ones.<br />
<br />
I understand they can't make 4 sets for each Allied Race, but the Lightforged have a lot of their looks already put in-game -- Nightborne do not. I don't care if I can use them on other races or not, I want a plate or leather looking Nightborne set.</div></div><hr />

Adoxe is right. The only allied race that are even possible to be Death Knights are the Dark Iron. All the others have valid lore reasons, just like the Pandaren, for why they can't be Death Knights.<br />

I can see both dark iron and zandalari having the options because A) they both make sense and B) they are the only two that are unlocked through your leveling from 110 to 120 gating the time to get them.</div></div><hr />

I think you could get away with using old fem troll models. But Mr. Hunch back imo should only be used if your character is all about the RP. Or if the zandalari troll racials are complete ass.</div></div><hr />

Why are alliance so butt hurt about a lack of a new druid option? This isnt the last of the allied races they could introduce more druid option races in the future.

I was thinking that too... It doesn't fit with any of them at first sight at least, and seems Blizzard so far agrees. Gonna be interesting to see what the end result will be. My main character is a druid and have been playing it since vanilla, so obviously I have my heart with the druids, and seeing so many of them join the horde in comparison to the Alliance doesn't feel quite right, when I've chosen Alliance myself.<br />
<br />
With that said, still bummed that the Nightborne joins the horde. Void elves don't quite catch my interest... even after the questline of Argus. Though might have some to do with aesthetics(sorry, can't spell the word properly). I find the apperance of the Nightborne more more appealing to me personality than the void elves. Don't like their shape(the way they are pointy and skinny, because yeah, I do like the Nightborne, which are also quite skinny), nor their cold colours seen so far.</div></div><hr />

There isn't ANY thing in Bfa witch is not stupid: the story is stupid, the whole concept of &quot;allied races&quot; is stupid, the end of set tiers is stupid, but it's not surprising because the only goal of Blizzard is to put an end to mythic raiding to casualise the game and let randoms being more geared than real mythic players, the idea of restricting transmog of your artifact only based on spec is stupid and it's a freaking troll: ALL artifact weapon should be able to be moged for ALL characters: let me have a warrior with Ashbringer if i want (by the way, Ashbringer is the most overrated weapon in the lore, it's only a piece of metal forged by a random dwarf and infused with a light orb found by another random guy, it's not a holy weapon and it's not a godly weapon, just a piece of metal crap), let me have the mage weapons on a warlock, etc.<br />
<br />
We can also talk about the characters: Jaina for example, who is still alive and will be a major character, and of course, everyone will forgive and more of that, forget all of sins since Cataclysm, and the fact that after her treason in Legion, she should have been executed, but noooo, she has a new skin, it's not to let her be killed, it's for &quot;redeem&quot; her, and butchering her a little more, because Blizzard has absolutly no talent to write characters, and now, with Golden working for Blizzard, the things will be worse: you know when people complained about Ghostcrawler? Well, Golden is the Ghostcrawler of the lore.<br />
<br />
Bfa is the WORST idea for an expansion EVER, Bfa is the ultimate proof that Blizzard did not undestand the failure of Wod, and that they are to remake it again, ten times worse.<br />
You though Wod was the worst expansion ever? Wait for Bfa, and you will know what worse really mean, and i will be there, eating pop-corns while watching Blizzard burns in the fire lighten by it's own incompetence.<br />

I can understand for a few ones (Zandalari and Dwarfes), but most of these races could've been neutral as Pandarens. I mean, as an Alliance superhero you get to save Highmountain Taurens in Legion and get Exalted with them, why couldn't they fight back for you ?<br />
Same for Nightborne.<br />
Regarding Void Elves, if I understand correctly, they are Blood Elves, previously loyal to Silvermoon, that decided to go to Alliance's side because their leader is in love with a Human ? Makes sense. They should be able to chose, not to be mindless sheeps.<br />
<br />
The good point in that is that I may race change only for Nightbornes (my Trolls are Females, and Zandalari Female Trolls are very similar to current Trolls model ; and I don't care about Taurens).</div></div><hr />

Most Alliance druids are Nightelves because there was no other option until Worgen was added... And have you seen the worgen females? They don't appeal to many, at least that's my impression. Think Nightelves are more appealing due to more than just Shadowmeld. When many of those druids were made, Shadowmeld wasn't even as awesome as it is today.</div></div><hr />

Have we already seen it? Is it a total mystery that won't appear until later? I'm still hoping it's not that weird form that Alleria never actually uses from the dungeon cutscene.<br />
<br />
<br />
+10 skill here +15 kill there, 1% reduced damage taken from xy type of dmg... In 2017-2018, they still consider these things as racials? Meanwhile horde is full of cc abilities which have real impact.<br />
<br />
What exactly are you hoping for? Dramatically broken racials that put particular races at a major advantage/disadvantage (or arguably worse force roles/class types)? I agree that 1% reduced damage is boring, but +skill bonuses are one of the most dramatic bonuses that I eagerly look forward to. The difference they make when leveling crafting professions is dramatic, and faster resource gathering is outstanding (tauren, worgen, and soon to be highmountain are probably the only races that can feasibly gather while being attacked, etc).<br />
<br />
This isn't a rhetorical question, I really am curious what exactly you're hoping for so I can respond to this appropriately and without assumptions. Typically speaking, every race just gets one real active racial (summoning a bank goblin/anvil doesn't really count), and none of them are outright bad or game changing in general. <br />
<br />
Right now, we don't know what the vast majority of these races will get so since you are bashing the Alliance I have to assume you are unhappy with the Lightforged Draenei racial? We don't know how it will be balanced yet, but if it's any consolation, I do agree that it's a boring racial on paper (assuming it doesn't have hilariously broken damage). But it's way, way too early to judge whether the factions' racials are 'balanced' or not, given that 4/6 are not even announced yet.</div></div><hr />

Remove the ones I mentioned and you call &quot;boring&quot;. They have zero impact. +10 skill at leveling? Leveling items don't have much impact and they last for a small fracture of the lifespan of an expansion - and they quickly lose their value after that, especially with the multiple sources of gear. You have to craft 3 less items to get to max skill, then what? Once you reached it, the best items will need max skill anyway. Max +10 skill level is even more useless.<br />
<br />
Instead of these useless racials, empower the existing ones, or I could imagine some kind of mass blind effect by the light at the lightforged draenei for example. Blackhole at voidelves, which swallows the enemy, pulling them towards it for a short amount of time. Having mass silence, mass stun, mass knockdown at horde, I think these things are not too unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hope this isn't the case. <br />
<br />
I don't have a single max level alliance toon, I don't want to be locked out of some races because I decided to main a character this expansion and have not exalted reputations/cleared content on multiple characters.<br />
<br />
This leads me to believe that the races will also be microtransactions or the quests can be done on both sides. If they aren't, that seems like a horrible way to start a &quot;faction&quot; based expansion or requiring players to purchases a boost and the grind old content between now and the launch of BFA. Unless of course, that is why the expansion comes with a free 110 boost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The argument that &quot;You only need to do it once&quot; is pretty irrelevant. Getting to maximum skill (since leveling is now a joke up to current expansion content) can be nightmarish in some circumstances; in Legion some professions have to level up on greens for the last few skill points or blow hundreds of gold per skill point. And sometimes, even then it's a yellow skill up -- which can fail. What you do before current expansion level doesn't matter much, and to be fair for a lot of professions, the endgame recipes don't matter much. But we don't know for a fact it will stay that way. And gathering bonuses will *never* be bad, even with enchantments, since you can use your racial + a different enchantment.<br />
<br />
I'd probably agree with your lightforged draenei racial. Alliance certainly could use more aggressive racials. When it comes to active racials, I'll agree that a flat damage racial will virtually always be a disappointment -- there is too thin a line between 'broken' and 'useless'.<br />

I agree, but let's be frank here. It's pretty obvious that Blizzard will allow access to Highmountain/Nightborne/Lightforged/Void Elves during the pre-launch patch if you preorder. Most likely all content to unlock them will be in Legion, since these races are directly tied to Legion content.</div></div><hr />

and what exactly is stopping you from doing all the rep token missions in your order hall to get the BoA tokens and mailing them all to your horde/alliance alts that need the rep?, absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therealbowser</div><div class="date">2017-11-27, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to add, too, another thing I'm concerned about that has yet to be addressed is the heritage armor.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it looks great and I'm fine with how it's unlocked, but it is basically preset to look like a specific level of armor. So will a dark iron warlock be forced to wear a plate heritage armor? I mean, as a joke that's kind of funny but let's be serious here. Or a hunter or warrior nightborne wearing a cloth kilt/skirt -- if it even had the option of leggings, it would look fantastic on anything other than possibly warriors. The only two heritage armors that would really suit a wide variety of classes would be the Highmountain and Zandalar armor (and void elves minus warriors), and even those are stretches in some cases.<br />
<br />
I really think that, at the very least, they should offer one alternative heritage armor set per race so that no particular race feels screwed out of classy looking armor for their chosen class. A cloth-style robe set for lightforged draenei and dark iron dwarves, a shaman-kilt style set for highmountain tauren, a nightborne armor style with leggings -- ideally with a mail armor appearance, a heavier armor style for void elves, and lastly a zandalari scholar style robe or kilt set would look great for them, too. But hey, this is just off the top of my head, I am sure others can come up with even better ideas.<br />
<br />
And yes, I am aware heritage armor is optional, but it's a big deal to me. I think it looks pretty badass, and for most of the armor types, there is a severe shortage of good looking armor for the races (Zandalari and dark iron especially). And most of these races, sadly, have the disadvantage of not having very much armor that would specifically look good with their theme.</div></div><hr />

Well, personally I have never bought those expensive &quot;expansion starter&quot; crafting items when they cost tens of thousands of gold, I was fine with dungeon gear, and in Legion with the WQ items. Being at the cutting edge for that +5 ilvl is the goal only for a small amount of players that go for realm first in the very first raid tier, so the time matters only for them. I can wait a few more weeks for lower prices or lucky drops, doesn't matter much. Or you are one of those who makes profit at the start of the expansion from these professions?<br />
<br />
The excruciating profession leveling experience is a Legion phenomenon so far, remember how easy was it in WoD. You can't know what brings BfA.</div></div><hr />

What's next, you going to complain that Horde has 2 tauren races and 2 troll races? (As I wrote that it hit me that we will have 2 elfs each side, 2 troll, 2 tauren, 2 dwarfs, 2 draenei... at this rate the next expansion will be Noah's Ark)</div></div><hr />

If their fee fees are so easy to offend then perhaps it's better for them to be gone. Like seriously what is wrong with elves in this regard? <br />
I have yet to see how Tyrande is a bitch to them, for just wanting for them to participate in fight for their own city, and reminding them that they didn't fight with other elves when Legion attacked. <br />
<br />
Boo hoo. If anything it portrayed Nightborn as spineless weakings. <br />

<br />
Actually, afaik any powerful Necromancer/Lich can create Death Knights. The Ebon Blade continually replenish their ranks despite not having the Lich King to aid them - the ability to create Order Hall Troops is ample proof of this. Hell, the original Four Horsemen were created by Kel'Thuzad.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you paid attention to the WotLK lore, specifically the Grizzly Hills stuff, you would know why the Worgen make perfect sense as a Death Knight race.<br />
<br />
It turns out I'm wrong about Worgen DKs not making any sense: An NPC in the DK intro questline explicitly states that you were a slave of Arugal in Shadowfang Keep before escaping with him. He also affirms that the player is Gilnean, so there ya go.<br />
<br />
<br />
Adoxe is right. The only allied race that are even possible to be Death Knights are the Dark Iron. All the others have valid lore reasons, just like the Pandaren, for why they can't be Death Knights.<br />
<br />
The Lich King getting his hands on a dead Pandaren isn't a huge stretch, since some of their kind do leave the Wandering Isle to travel the world (like Chen). I honestly think the main reason you can't roll a Panda DK is because it'd look completely ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Even back in Wrath it made no sense that new Death Knights had to participate in TBC questing content (which predates their creation chronologically) before hitting Northrend.<br />

Cataclysm made it even worse, since literally every single new character has to jump back in time to do levels 58-78 now.<br />

tauren are already great tanks anyway.<br />

they are very close<br />

<br />
<br />
Alleria Windrunner learned to harness the void without falling to madness by her mentor The Locus-Walker. The Void has a reputation for corrupting those who use it, but Alleria has since managed to train a group of outcasted Blood Elves to resist it as well.<br />
The whole Mac'ree quest line is terrible, double so if your a shadow priest standing right next to her thinking &quot;I have this dagger that drains void energy... give me two hours and I could drain this whole region&quot;. The High Priest of the Netherlight Temple has the power to save a Naa'ru from darkness... so WHY THE HELL DID SHE KILL IT!<br />
<br />
I hate this, its just such lame writing to say she is trained to handle the madness. I was their during her final training... Locus-walker sounded like a retired football coach with head trauma saying &quot;You can do it, You can do it&quot;<br />
<br />
Its staring into the Void. She killed a Naa'ru and stole the power... that is not a sane start for a new race, that should make her Public Enemy #1 for the Light. <br />
With her sister going mad on the other side, I think she is pathological and in denial, the only explanation is she was insane before taking void form like a ninja looting kill stealing hunter.<br />
<br />
Also the Elves are the most addictive and fundamentally the most scariest race on three planets... everytime they persue a new source of power they doom themselves, their civilisation and the whole planet. We just save the Nightbourne from their mistake... by using a Tree that failed and mutated a whole city of Nightbourne into spiders and crystal creatures. The arcan'dor, the night well, the sunwell, the well of eternity, and half the artifacts they ever touched have cursed most life on this planet. they are all ticking time bombs that nearly destroyed the planet every time. SO WHY WOULD WE TRUST ELVES WITH THE VOID!!! Let alone defecting (or as I call them defective) blood elves. We don't trust gnomes with nukes, and they only made that mistake once.</div></div><hr />

Amen brother! Can't get hyped with this feature... TBH i am not hyped in general with the expansion details revealed so far. I am afraid blizzard will go from a relatively good exp as Legion to a mediocre i.e. WoD, and maybe this to maximize profits. I am sure Legion costed tons of money to bring people back to wow.</div></div><hr />

Them joining the Alliance seems actually a lot less obvious when you look at it like that. <br />

Why would the light forged who follow velan post the naruu and have a human commander famous for facing orcs join the hord? <br />

Well the hord isn't the united state's there's no federal mandate on what's acceptable and what's not. It's an alliance of independent nations what's fine for the forsaken isn't fine for others. I imagine after the whole fel kelthas thing dabbling in potentially evil powers isn't seen in a good light anymore. We know the void elves were alleria's first choice. She try to get the blood elves to rejoin the alliance but gets told no so she helps the exiles master the void and intern they join her and the alliance. <br />
<br />
The light forged are Dreani, Dreani hate orcs. The light forged follow velan who's an alliance faction leader. Yea you can be exalted with them as an orc but a. It's the old we need you help and we hate the legion enough to live with alluring with you ( hence hord being allowed into the exodar to get to argus in the first place) and b. Game mechanic's c. You are a champion not a faction leader there's been a number of occasions where you have been set apart as an exception because your so Damned ausome or what ever hell the majority of mop the hord champions got a pass by the Pandaran as not representative of garrosh's crap. <br />
<br />
My alliance paladin is exalted with the zandalari from back in vanilla with the zulgurub quests dosent mean the zandalari don't seriously hate humans still. <br />
<br />
So to answer the question no we hord are not good enough now the legion is dealt with. We were a necessary tool they nolonger need.<br />

The playable dps were made sometime near the end of tbc after the Dreani had landed and been inducted into the alliance. Dreani dk's are ones that went to help the agent's in the plague lands and got killed. <br />

Playable dks are not from the 3rd war you died and we're raised at the end of tbc and a sacrificial force to lure out tirion for the lk to kill nothing more nothing less hence why the dks were so pissed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therealbowser</div><div class="date">2017-11-27, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, personally I have never bought those expensive &quot;expansion starter&quot; crafting items when they cost tens of thousands of gold, I was fine with dungeon gear, and in Legion with the WQ items. Being at the cutting edge for that +5 ilvl is the goal only for a small amount of players that go for realm first in the very first raid tier, so the time matters only for them. I can wait a few more weeks for lower prices or lucky drops, doesn't matter much. Or you are one of those who makes profit at the start of the expansion from these professions?<br />
<br />
The excruciating profession leveling experience is a Legion phenomenon so far, remember how easy was it in WoD. You can't know what brings BfA.<br />
<br />
WoD was a strange exception. It was pretty bad in vanilla, very bad in TBC. I don't recall WotLK, Cataclysm, or even Pandaria too well, but none of them had easy leveling for every profession. Blacksmithing, which is one of the ones that were added for certain, are one of the worst to level.<br />
<br />
+10 skill seems like nothing, but an orange lasting 10 levels longer means that you can transition into something easier to level that much easier. On blood elves, leveling enchanting compared to other races is phenomenally easy. It's like day and night. Same for Jewelcrafting on Draenei.<br />
<br />
WoD was a complete joke in terms of professions, please don't use it as an example. You had maximum skill from the beginning, maxing out your profession didn't unlock more recipes, it just made you slightly more efficient on daily cooldowns. Which did not matter hardly at all.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that they are the world's most critical racials, but they are extremely useful and make a huge impact. Far more than -1% nature damage will ever do. So, if you want to argue about removing/changing racials, scrap those from your list. They serve a very clear and powerful purpose, and actually offer important racial aesthetics that you can actually feel on your character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole Mac'ree quest line is terrible, double so if your a shadow priest standing right next to her thinking &quot;I have this dagger that drains void energy... give me two hours and I could drain this whole region&quot;. The High Priest of the Netherlight Temple has the power to save a Naa'ru from darkness... so WHY THE HELL DID SHE KILL IT!<br />
<br />
I hate this, its just such lame writing to say she is trained to handle the madness. I was their during her final training... Locus-walker sounded like a retired football coach with head trauma saying &quot;You can do it, You can do it&quot;<br />
<br />
Its staring into the Void. She killed a Naa'ru and stole the power... that is not a sane start for a new race, that should make her Public Enemy #1 for the Light. <br />
With her sister going mad on the other side, I think she is pathological and in denial, the only explanation is she was insane before taking void form like a ninja looting kill stealing hunter.<br />
<br />
Also the Elves are the most addictive and fundamentally the most scariest race on three planets... everytime they persue a new source of power they doom themselves, their civilisation and the whole planet. We just save the Nightbourne from their mistake... by using a Tree that failed and mutated a whole city of Nightbourne into spiders and crystal creatures. The arcan'dor, the night well, the sunwell, the well of eternity, and half the artifacts they ever touched have cursed most life on this planet. they are all ticking time bombs that nearly destroyed the planet every time. SO WHY WOULD WE TRUST ELVES WITH THE VOID!!! Let alone defecting (or as I call them defective) blood elves. We don't trust gnomes with nukes, and they only made that mistake once.<br />
<br />
On the vindicar you can listen to conversations between the emmisary of the nightborne and the blood elves. They do have some pretty similar history and shared issues with addiction and withdrawal from magic so it is pretty understandable they could chose to join with the horde. The void elves if they are disciples of alleria make sense to join the alliance because she hates what became of her sister and fought vs the horde for a long time prior to her joining the army of light. I think we will see more of the background of the void elves with the release of the argus raid and the epilogue patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point in time I just find the whole DK starter experience to be very jarring. Seeing Arthas the Lich King now is weird when we all know he's dead, seeing Tirion not only alive, but reclaiming and purifying Ashbringer which player Character Paladins now wield is ridiculous and the last step where you visit your capital city is also just out of place when you can see Pandaren, Monks, revamped world from Deathwing, Demon Hunters, etc... which didn't exist back when you the player character DK were actually &quot;created.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not convinced the player character DK's even need a unique starter experience anymore, at least not a required one. Why couldn't they just start at level 55 like they do now with the starter gear, with a level ~60 quest from Acherus giving you the blue gear they currently get throughout the starter experience. They'd just be level 55, starting at Acherus with a quest to head to your capital city, similar to now, and be directed to the Hero's call board afterward to just start questing.<br />
<br />
Make the unique starting experience for current classes that can be DK's and the new/ newer races that can't be just start at 55 like I describe above. Lore wise there's no reason every race can't be Death Knights. Limiting it to just races that existed prior to Cataclysm is ridiculous and the whole time bubble thing is just awkward and doesn't make sense.<br />

I see no logic in Blood Elves of any kind fighting against the Horde. Joining Alleria to learn Void Magic is one thing, but abandoning and betraying your faction is something entirely different and doesn't make sense.<br />

Unless Blizz pulls something ridiculous and stupid and the Horde rejects Void Elves for some asinine reason so they're essentially forced to join the Alliance if they want to survive. Either way, I find that description completely retarded.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">derpkitteh</div><div class="date">2017-11-27, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point in time I just find the whole DK starter experience to be very jarring. Seeing Arthas the Lich King now is weird when we all know he's dead, seeing Tirion not only alive, but reclaiming and purifying Ashbringer which player Character Paladins now wield is ridiculous and the last step where you visit your capital city is also just out of place when you can see Pandaren, Monks, revamped world from Deathwing, Demon Hunters, etc... which didn't exist back when you the player character DK were actually &quot;created.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not convinced the player character DK's even need a unique starter experience anymore, at least not a required one. Why couldn't they just start at level 55 like they do now with the starter gear, with a level ~60 quest from Acherus giving you the blue gear they currently get throughout the starter experience. They'd just be level 55, starting at Acherus with a quest to head to your capital city, similar to now, and be directed to the Hero's call board afterward to just start questing.<br />
<br />
Make the unique starting experience for current classes that can be DK's and the new/ newer races that can't be just start at 55 like I describe above. Lore wise there's no reason every race can't be Death Knights. Limiting it to just races that existed prior to Cataclysm is ridiculous and the whole time bubble thing is just awkward and doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
i guess i'd be ok with them getting the allied race treatment, with a system similar to ESO's starting experience. just start in stormwind/org at 58, and have an option to choose to do the starting experience for those of us who have done it before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is it that Nightborne can't be Demon Hunter's when they technically already have them, they just aren't blind. They are located mostly in the Elite area around the Nighthold and below the Vineyard. I believe they are called Felsworn Noble's, but I'm not sure of their Imperial rank designation.<br />
<br />
It's a bummer that it's stuck between just the one race on each side at the moment.<br />
<br />
Also, during quest dialogue while becoming exalted with the Nightborne, it explicitly states that they do have a class that is almost identical to a Paladin, they are called Spellbreaker's. The only difference is they seem to use an arcane-infused wielding of the Light. Similar to how the Blood Elves &quot;bent&quot; the Light to their will, forcing it to be used instead of wielding the Light normally.<br />
<br />
I really wish it had more than just the basic classes.</div></div><hr />

Instead of these useless racials, empower the existing ones, or I could imagine some kind of mass blind effect by the light at the lightforged draenei for example. <br />
I thought the same thing, but no.... Blizzard never learn, they have to put another useless racial to the alliance and more cc to the horde...<br />

Why are the Tauren racials such garbage compared to the draenei ones? <br />
&quot;Taurens should be marginally tougher and be good at fishing, while draneis should have extra skills for dealing damage, healing and boosted blacksmithing that they can do anywhere&quot;.<br />

And that doesn't sound very contrived to you? It does to me, just a reason made up on the fly to give an explanation why they can't be part of the horde too.<br />

Same with the other races. It all feels very forced. They could easily spin it in any way they want. It's a deliberate choice on Blizzard to limit the allied races to one faction each. <br />

I don't even like the elves, but the game is not my own alone, specially the new generation who like them. what I want is to give the alliance highelves or the nightborne instead of void fan-made elves and remove the lightforged drenei wich is the same as drenei instead of a purple naru they listen to a yellow one lol. and give the horde manari eredar, because the whole game don't have warlock draenei (eredar) as we knew from Warcraft 3. but they chosen the lightforged because it will be harder to implement new anims to the manari eredar so it looked like the erdars from Warcraft 3.<br />

The general gist I got from this I disagree with. <br />
I think allied races are more than welcome. And who knows they might do exiled Eradar down the line.<br />
Perhaps Eradar that lived when Sargares got beaten and want to switch sides. <br />
Maybe even make it so you are slightly hatred towards the faction you join and have to grind reputation to do stuff.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm missing something, but as I know, a recipe changes colour by skill level, not by amount of made. So e.g. a pair of boots turns to yellow from orange at 750 skill level, whether you have the +10 skill or not. You just reach the max/required skill +10 skill points &quot;earlier&quot; than others. <br />
<br />
So my statement about it's only benefical at the start of an expansion still stands, because cutting edge players will need the best items as soon as possible and someone with +10 skill levels can put these items in the AH +10 skill levels earlier than others. However a few weeks after the expansion starts, your advantage is lost for the rest of the expansion, because others also reach those certain skill levels at their professions and the supply increases on the market over time, thus the prices go lower. You can ride that horse only once per expansion.<br />
<br />
I also know about blacksmithing in Legion, and it was more like a bug, a design flaw, which was fixed later. You should never need a +10 skill level racial to even be able to level your profession further, while others stuck, because of a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me explain this in a way that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Let's say that, for instance, the only item to progress from 790 to 800 is a yellow recipe that costs massive endgame materials to make an item that doesn't sell very well. However, there is an item from 780-790 that is fairly cheap and yellow (and goes green at 790). <br />
<br />
If you have +10 skill, that fairly cheap item from 780-790 will be yellow from 790-800 (and probably orange from 780 to 790, to boot). So you save yourself thousands of gold because one of your cheaper recipes lasts 10 skill levels longer.<br />
<br />
If you are confused how this works, just make a blood elf, take it to level 5, and try out enchanting. The initial recipes (such as minor health) that require 1 strange dust normally go yellow at 70 skill and green at 90 skill. But on a blood elf, they will go yellow at 80 skill and green at 100 skill. This means your super cheap 1x strange dust recipes last 10 levels longer.<br />
<br />
In short, you are missing something. Test it out yourself and you'll see. And don't feel bad, a lot of people don't know this. Hell, I didn't know this either once upon a time, and when I found out, I was very impressed.<br />

Why would Eredar join anyone? Why would anyone let them join them? They are demons and need to be exterminated, they have no place in the universe and are probably on the run from everyone, if not outright wiped out.</div></div><hr />

That's a single character. If you're suggesting Dreadlords become a playable race, then by all means. We just need an entire race of them, not just one individual. And for the sake of completion, we'd probably need female dreadlords, too. That's a lot of work for an odd race that very few people are going to play.<br />

It's all good, but I still don't see how does this help you once you reached max skill level and will have no advantege when glue eater Billy also have the max skill level and able to sell the same items in the AH only in a few days/weeks of difference at an expansion start. You just have better option to level the skill, but this only helps at the leveling, while an active ability or increased stat lasts through the whole expansion. <br />
<br />
Also with the many gearing options, professions like blacksmithing lose their value even more. They should bring back sellable sockets to blacksmithing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure where you're going with this.<br />
<br />
Blood Elves, when still ruled by Kael'thas, were shunned due to their affliction and given extremely difficult almost suicidal missions by the Alliance military to keep them away so they turned to the Naga for help for which they were arrested and sentenced to death (though were later rescued). They joined the Horde due to an alliance with the Forsaken, with Sylvanas and her undead elves being the only allies they had.<br />
<br />
The Blood Elves didn't abandon or betray the Alliance, the Alliance betrayed and abandoned them, which is why they joined the Horde. So them going back to join the faction that abandoned, betrayed, arrested, and sentenced them to death for an affliction that's not their fault...due to them embracing the void makes absolutely zero sense.<br />
