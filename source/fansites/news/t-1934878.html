Do you know if only the raiders are getting invites, or if it's just a generic invite to all/most guild members. I'm in a friend's 13/13M guild, but I haven't raided in months thanks to WoD destroying all my guilds.</div></div><hr />

They seem to have gotten the idea from Fractals in Guild Wars 2. They scale up to level 100 and each level is more difficult with a different debuff.</div></div><hr />

It can't be real, but the data makes it seem so; level 110 missions, resources, a placeholder for a new building...<br />
<br />
I don't understand. Who is in charge at Blizzard? Is it a team of induviduals coming to an agreement? If you did an exit poll of why people have stopped subbing or even bothered to not gold farm WoW tokens, wouldn't GARRISONS be the number one chosen reason why they disliked and gave up on WoD? It's been the central issue for people voicing boredom claims, completely setting the flying fiasco and finding reasons to be out in the world itself aside.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand, they are so far gone from many of the roots that existed in WoW at it's early days. It's silly to whine and cry for old versions of WoW to come back, but implementing more and more mind numbly easy systems just doesn't make any logical sense.</div></div><hr />

The new Adventure Map and Champion systems are built using the Garrison system as a backbone, so any new stuff for those systems is flagged as part of the Garrison system during datamining.<br />
<br />
They're used to discover/unlock new world content and to provide buffs in specific zones, stuff like that. It's basically a hub where you plan out what activities you want to do.</div></div><hr />

Thought it was maelstrom but many spells refer to lunar power. Since when do shamans have anything to do with the moon? Screwy thing for Blizzard to do. Guess they're basing the maelstrom system off the balance druid resource bar rather than warriors.<br />
2.) That rat mount got a tail? Funny rat if it doesn't.<br />
3.) Potentially updating racial mounts. After ignoring them and yet giving PvP updated ones, I have to say about god damn time. -_-<br />
4.) Fish mount ... yeah, that will see a lot of use. Think that'll join the seahorses in the useful bin. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I have a theory on who gets into alpha.<br />
1.) Streamers will get in first just because they generate hype. Doesn't matter if they're actually good or if they'll really offer feedback. More followers you have, the more likely Blizzard will notice you and give you an invite.<br />
2.) Mythic raiders. Those with 13/13 mythic are more likely to get in than someone who is 0/13 but yet may be 13/13 heroic.<br />
<br />
I started to think that the other day. When I got into the WotLK beta, I was in one of the top guilds on my server and working through Sunwell. Pretty much my entire guild got in. Meanwhile, friends who were struggling to get out of Kara didn't get in. Cata beta came and I was no longer raiding so I didn't get into beta. MoP beta I only got into because of the annual pass. I'm now in a guild that's 6/13 heroic and then I have 1/13 mythic down with the very guild I quit raiding with back in WotLK. Helping them out as a pug healer although chances are I'll get replaced soon enough once they get a guildie who can heal. Stands to reason I'll likely see Legion beta although certainly not alpha. I wouldn't count on me getting an invite until probably spring or early summer unless I get more mythic kills. But if my theory is true, then invites to beta aren't really random and are based upon your progress in the game. They might start to do random invites later, although I don't suspect those would be truly random, either. But since this is still alpha, I fully suspect Blizzard to invite 12/13 and 13/13 mythic people over those who are only 13/13 LFR. While fine for alpha, not sure I like that system for beta since there's potential of them tuning content to the elite and making it impossible for lesser players to do something. I can understand it to get useful feedback and not childish feedback from people who don't understand bugs, but I do hope Blizzard invites people across the spectrum and not those on the upper end sooner rather than later.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I'm not a big fan of them inviting 13/13M players first. WoD destroyed so many guilds this xpac that I've given up raiding, but my friends who kept going are 13/13M. I wouldn't say they're going to be better alpha testers than me. They just happen to be able to raid 2 hours later than we previously did.</div></div><hr />

If I'm not mistaken the table is only used to start quests that we go out in the world to do. If you look at the duration it's 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
The rewards are also 5 copper, the gains 0xp, the costs 5 resources, etc. They're placeholder values ;_;.<br />

I am hopeful it'll be what you guessed/suggested, but am obviously waiting nervously for an official confirmation</div></div><hr />

One guy who was on our kill but has since left the guild did not get it that much I can say. Obviously I'm super happy to be in so I'm a bit biased but I think it's a good move to get the most competent raid testers in they can and have them be able to work as a unit as if they would on live to see what works/does not work at that level.<br />
<br />
I hope they invite some none mythic raiders also to see how things go for mid tier guilds etc and none raiders but that's just the way it goes I suppose.</div></div><hr />

Loving the fox mount, wonder where it's going to fit in. Ideas? (It doesn't seem shiney enough for the store at least). Maybe if its a Nightfallen mount there'll be a black version too :O</div></div><hr />
