Children's Week is Coming: April 29 - May 5<br />
Children's Week is coming! Taking place once a year in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Dalaran, and Shattrath City, this week-long celebration is a time to give back to the innocents orphaned by war.<br />
<br />
This year, the holiday will begin on April 29 and will end on May 5. Take an orphan under your wing, perform the tasks you are presented with and you’ll show one of Azeroth’s children that you care (and be rewarded with a special in-game pet to boot).<br />
Many orphans wish they had someone special to show them the wonders of the world. Throughout the year, they often spend their time wandering around their home cities of Stormwind or Orgrimmar, dreaming of the day they'll be old enough (and big enough) to venture out into the world to see the sights their parents would have shown them.<br />
<br />
During Children's Week, brave heroes of the Horde and the Alliance can make these kids' dreams come true! Visit your faction’s local orphanage to take one of these children on a whirlwind adventure around the world.<br />

<br />
Children's Week in Eastern Kingdoms or Kalimdor<br />
<br />
Many orphans wish they had someone special to show them the wonders of the world. Throughout the year, these children spend their time wandering around their home cities of Stormwind or Orgrimmar, dreaming of the day they'll be old enough (and big enough) to venture out into the world and see the sights their parents would have shown them. During Children's Week, brave adventurers of the Horde and the Alliance can make these kids' dreams come true! Visit your faction’s local orphanage to take one of these children on a whirlwind adventure around the world. Talk to either Orphan Matron Nightingale in Stormwind (Alliance) or Orphan Matron Battlewail in Orgrimmar (Horde). After that, you’ll be able to take your young friend on an adventure across Azeroth.<br />

It's like &quot;Oh, which one should we use? I know, let's just split the difference and use both&quot;... If they had picked either one and stuck with it, I'd be happy, but to half-ass it like that is just silly... Feels like they just kinda phoned it in on that one... &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If by &quot;famous landmarks&quot; you mean one place 500 yds away from capital and by &quot;adventures&quot; you mean two quests that take 10 minutes to complete then indeed this is quite an epic event.<br />

At least with noblegarden I was able to farm three plainstriders, now it took one hour to get everything.</div></div><hr />

After weeks and weeks, then months and months of the same thing I figured, &quot;Frick it. Some day I'll go back in get it maybe, but for now I have a staff thats close enough and I think I'll go regain a small portion of the sanity I gave up getting just to this point.&quot;<br />

It has a very anime feel to it. The rest of the set fits, but it doesn't at the same time. I don't know. It needs more zippers and blue cloth to really stand out for me. I took a color theory class; this is just a piled-on mish-mash of everything but the kitchen sink's color.</div></div><hr />

It was a good story, too bad we all couldn't at least experience the story points. Same thing with the Rogue Legendary. Seems like they had a cool character, but I know nothing about him through in-game stories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways the mage set is cool but im feeling a final fantasy vibe from it again? Ah well one last idea i think the Warlocks horns should billow smoke or fel flames or something dont you think.<br />
<br />
That musical song grinds on your ears abit lol its like a bad song with no chorus that keeps on going....<br />
<br />
&quot;I want ma baby back baby back baby back,i want ma baby back baby back baby back&quot; &quot;WHEN DO THEY SAY RIBS!?&quot; &quot;NEVAHHHHH!!!&quot; &quot;I want ma......&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fleps</div><div class="date">2012-04-30, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope they actually start using the 3 colors in-game. Always we see 3 colors but just 2 are actually available.<br />
<br />
The warrior set look badass, the warlock is OK and the mage one is just silly, it looks like a vendor from some fantasy festival.<br />
<br />
And man I hate this &quot;huge belt&quot; design style that Blizzard started at WotLK... the mage one looks like a fanny pack.. ahhrg</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if you ask me, then Blizzard should create some kind of application to let the players contest about gear-looks. Would save Blizzard alot work (and they get it for &quot;free (well, some price like 1 year free subscription to WoW or something x11 classes, and a title for the one that win, like &quot;Designer CharName&quot;)&quot;).<br />
<br />
And there would probably be alot nicer looks on gear. :) For all classes.</div></div><hr />

Are people really satisfied with the inferior armor models in this game still? The leg armor still looks like spandwx on a newwer model, the hand armor is STILL the same model with a different texture. FFS already. look at the other mmos out and coming out. this is the death knell of WOW. MOP. its was a fun 6yrs but nows the time to find something new. if people don't branch out nothing will ever get the chance to become as good ( on the development side) as wow has become.</div></div><hr />
