Warcraft Movie Trailer Fan Art<br />
The Warcraft movie shown at Blizzcon never made its way to the internet, but Yanmo Zhang watched it multiple times and sketched out the scenes that were shown. You can find Yanmo Zhang's art on his website (http://www.artofyanmo.com/) or DeviantArt (http://yanmozhang.deviantart.com/).<br />
<br />
There is some additional context for each image on the DeviantArt page (http://yanmozhang.deviantart.com/journal/Impression-of-Warcraft-Movie-Trailer-495895460).<br />

Items<br />
I'm confused by some of the trinkets nerfs and I'm not talking about epic BoE trinkets. Why nerf regular heroic trinkets that hard?<br />
We're planning on making more trinket changes, but I don't have details beyond that yet (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/537746462491152384))<br />

Garrisons<br />
Is mining ever going to be worth anything this xpac.<br />
The Garrison was giving too much ore. That was hotfixed yesterday. Will take some time to see the effects. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/537735413880733696))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Why did you remove the exp bonus for completing a BG?! I thought you wanted to make leveling through PvP/BGs more rewarding in WoD?<br />
it's a bug on our radar to fix (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/537268035078615042))<br />
<br />
Ashran is really quite a disappointment, everyone on my server says the same. You never fixed faction imbalance at all...<br />
We're still working on it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/537389371368816640))<br />

Gorgrond to Timeless Isle Teleport<br />
Several users have mentioned this now, so we thought we should share it with you! If you ever get the urge to go back to Timeless Isle and visit the frogs, there is a nice teleport back to Draenor in the nearby underwater cave. Sitting in the chair and clicking the fire puts you in a remote spot in Gorgrond. Getting to this location in Gorgrond might require the shredder, as it is fairly high up.<br />

It's probably since the lawyers of Legendary would probably have no problems finding who did it and fine the hell out of them before they got imprisoned. It's just not worth the risk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, but same argument just aimed at them then, they really really should of taken into account the majority of the player base, not being able to be there, but still paying customers, paying customers who finance, interest and loyalty in the game is the major reason the movie was done</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find that funny lol.<br />
<br />
Blizzard made Warcraft and World of Warcraft, those who work on the movie get payed by Blizzard, Blizzard owns the movie and they own the game. Blizzard SHOULD be able to do WHATEVER they want WHENEVER they want.<br />
<br />
So basically, those who work on the movie, are ignorant brats with no soul. Damn I would be so happy if Blizzard just literally posted now that the movie is extended by 3 years and they have a new studio working on the movie.<br />
<br />
I've played the game for 8 years, stayed subed for almost the whole time. Bought every expansion, bought some stuff from store and used some of their services. Yes that's a LOT of money. And I don't deserve to watch the trailer? I mean, the virtual ticket isn't super cheap, if it was like 2$ I'd MAYBE understand it, like MAYBE. But it's WAY more then that. So obviously, Blizzard doesn't care enough about their costumers.<br />
<br />
I didn't purchase the virtual ticket since I couldn't afford it, but it's just the most shittiest thing Blizzard can do. I'm actually really glad I didn't purchase it, they didn't even show anything interesting at Blizzcon except the movie, and that was not available for virtual ticket. Only thing they showed at Blizzcon was, a shitty game that's coming, some info on Diablo 3 patch which was nothing more then just info they could've posted online and nothing else interesting.<br />
<br />
Also did they mention they wouldn't show movie trailer for those who were watching with the virtual ticket?</div></div><hr />

Over react much? There is still almost a whole year till the release of the movie. More than enough time for a theatrical trailer to be released.</div></div><hr />

So you know nothing about how film rights and product licensing work. Got it. Legendary Pictures owns the Warcraft film license and is producing the film, not Blizzard Entertainment.<br />
<br />
<br />
So obviously, Blizzard doesn't care enough about their costumers.<br />
They have a costume contest every year at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also did they mention they wouldn't show movie trailer for those who were watching with the virtual ticket?<br />
They never even said there would be a trailer until they said people could watch a teaser in the theater hall.<br />
<br />
People just assumed there would be.<br />

<br />
-.- really a flying dalran at the first war ? i hope its not true!<br />
If you expect this movie to follow the game canon exactly, you're going to be sorely disappointed.<br />
<br />
They have two hours, give or take, to tell an entire story, and have to encapsulate that story in the form of a film. They're going to make all sorts of alterations and tweaks to the story and setting for the sake of making the movie more entertaining.<br />
<br />
It's like the Marvel Cinematic universe. The Warcraft film will have its own continuity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about the trailer wont be released at all, it's about Blizzard throwing shit at our faces over and over again. Then claiming not be allowed to show the trailer, that's bullshit, they have all the rights they need to show who ever they want the trailer. I doubt Legendary would quit making the movie lol, they're probably getting quite a lot of money, I mean I would STFU if I was them. Cause it's Blizzard we're talking about.<br />
<br />
So ye, over react or not. Blizzard still doesn't treat us like valuable costumers. Heck, they treat the new people better then the older ones that play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The major difference is that Legendary has invested a lot of resources into this movies while players haven't spent a dime on it. We have only paid to play the game.<br />
<br />
When it comes to big projects money and knowledge means a lot more than loyalty (unfortunately).</div></div><hr />

But if we take these pictures for truth, then it stands that the film is deviating from already established lore. Orcs, at that point standing beefore the Dark Portal should already be green, Durotan included. Now, it might be the artist's own vision, but I think s/he would colour them correctly.<br />
<br />
Another thing are high elves in the picture 11. Based on the surroundings and other pictures we can only assume this is meant to be High Elves of Dalaran. Well, the problem is that Dalaran did not get involved in the First War. Hell, nobody on Azeroth aside from Stormwind took part in the First War. Another thing about Dalaran that makes me question how very loyal filmmakers are to the lore is the fact that there is picture showing Dalaran FLYING. Dalaran did not move anywhere until they moved it to Northrend.<br />
<br />
I don't care how visually impressive the whole thing looks. I want it to be &quot;historically&quot; accurate. Seriously, with addition of Dalaran you are only making things complicated to those that don't know Warcraft. The point of First War, and making a filmabout it, is that it is great introduction. You have orcs, you have humans, and they are at war. And with the future wars the setting gets larger, as they add high elves, dwarves, Dalaran, other human kingdoms and so forth.</div></div><hr />

LEGENDARY: Yo Blizz, can we put that flying magical city in the movie? That's a really badass and powerful visual.<br />
BLIZZ: Well, Dalaran wasn't flying until WotLK, but you're right, it's a powerful and iconic image that we should capitalise on. Who's to say that Dalaran wasn't able to fly before WotLK?</div></div><hr />

Of all the things to get annoyed about this is quite a trivial thing. It's purely an aesthetic change, and a wise move imo - it makes Dalaran stand out, and if any of the movie-goers play the game they don't have to wonder why Dalaran is now flying.<br />

I doubt Legendary would quit making the movie lol, they're probably getting quite a lot of money, I mean I would STFU if I was them. Cause it's Blizzard we're talking about.<br />
<br />
So ye, over react or not. Blizzard still doesn't treat us like valuable costumers. Heck, they treat the new people better then the older ones that play.<br />
<br />
Saying it's bullshit, just comfirms that you do in fact have no idea what you're talking about. Heck, you get annoyed when it's pointed out that you can't blame Blizzard, which shows you had an axe to grind to begin with, facts or reasoning be damned. Also, as much as I like Blizzard, their name does not carry as much weight as Legendary in mainstream media. Saying &quot;It's Blizzard we're talking about&quot; doesn't really mean anything, Legendary are not quaking in their boots, lest they upset the mighty Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Do Marvel have any rights over the movie versions of X-Men, Daredevil, Spider Man or Fantastic Four? No they do not. Do you think they would like to? Of course they fucking would. But there's essentially nothing they can do. And they have Disney lawyers on their side.<br />
<br />
Now, lets get those little neurons to work: Lets just say, in your hypothetical version of reality (which doesn't exist), Blizzard hold all the cards. What would they have to gain from NOT showing virtual ticket holders the trailer apart from ire, hmm? Answer me that.</div></div><hr />

Dalaran flying is pretty fucking big deal and horrendous error. It was made mobile only after it's rebuilding and then the reason was to fight Blue Dragonflight and Scourge on Northrend. There's no tactical or practical reason to have Dalaran flying during the First War. It is as big of a screw up as having brown Durotan taking a major part in the war.<br />

Butcher it how? It's just a nice change to make the city feel like actual city of magic. A single picture can say more than a hundred words, and that is the case for flying Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Besides, tons of mages, including the most powerful ones, were killed when Arthas attacked Dalaran, and even those that survived were able to make it fly a few years later. This means they probably could have easily made it happen when mages like Antonidas were still alive. Before you pull the Scourge card - they haven't done it in the Third War because they thought that their defenses are way more than enough, and since Arthas was fixed on taking Dalaran at all costs, it seemed like a great opportunity to wipe out most of his forces with little risk. <br />
<br />
So... they are not really butchering the lore in this case.</div></div><hr />

No matter how logical it would be to have Dalaran flying in the first war, that was not how it went! They are blatantly disregarding established canon to do shit for the sake of it looking cool. I hoped the movie would be faithful representation, but alas, that's not what we will get.<br />

Moreover, if some of you remember, GulDan sent Teron to Dalaran, to steal the Eye. And it would make much more sense for Teron to flew in the flying Dalaran on the spine of Deathwing in the potential sequels, than it was in the novel where Dalaran stand on the ground. And it would be more epic. Overall i dont see how flying Dalaran may ruin the main plot.</div></div><hr />

If you were hoping for a completely faithful representation of the lore then I hope your expectations have been suitably lowered. I mean, how could it be when Blizzard's approach to their own &quot;canon&quot; lore is to jettison narrative coherence in favour of gameplay at every opportunity? While I expect night elves and maybe goblins to show up in potential sequels, I don't think taurens or draenai are going to make an appearance because a movie, just as a game, is bound by limitations .<br />
I'm happy enough that it seems that they are trying to incorporate the essence of the story in the movie rather than just making some random assed movie with humans and orcs fighting in it with the Warcraft name. A Dalaran flying before the time it started to fly in the lore is the least &quot;butchering&quot; that could have been done.</div></div><hr />

For some of you it's a short journey, cheap journey to get there and just the ticket cost, the rest of us would be looking at hundreds in travelling costs and god knows how much for a hotel room for a night or two. It just isn't practical for the majority of us<br />
<br />
Legendary (funding) and Universal Pictures (distribution &lt;- that's really important) have the rights for the movie, if they don't want to show it online Blizzard (only creative rights) can't do anything.

If that tips you of, just don't watch the movie. No adaptation from book to movie is 1:1, because some things just don't work, or do work better if changed. Also they are not making this movie only for Warcraft lore junkies, but pretty much everyone who will be interested to go watch it. A floating city just screams that there's powerful stuff happening there, which means the general public will understand that from the image, without having to explain why this place is special. <br />
<br />
As for the Stormwind park, really? You are just nit picking, like there's no tomorrow, maybe 100 people, including you, care about such small incoherent things, the vast majority wouldn't mind if they remove the iconic sculptures from the main gate, because it doesn't matter in the big picture. I'm playing Warcraft games since the series started, I do know major lore points and what happened, but aside from that I don't care that much and I'm pretty fine if they get the general stuff right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a shocker, all movie adaptions have to somehow deviate from the source material in order to make it work as film. Point is, the Warcraft Movie is still very much a brave project and I'm very critical as to where this can become a commercial success that is able to spawn a whole series of movies. Legendary will have to pull a a lot of of &quot;tricks&quot; to make this appealing to more than just the die-hard Warcraft fans - I'm sure a flying Dalaran is just one of many.</div></div><hr />

Fuck it... This is why video game movies suck. They always fuck up things.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make any difference though. In the game canon it's a flying city because they needed to mobilise against Malygos. In the movie canon it's flying because it's a magical city, of course you'd make a flying city if you could. And of course it provides the same tactical advantage that it does in Northrend in-game. Mostly though this is just an aesthetic change. Having it be a flying city makes it recognisable and iconic.<br />
<br />
I want the movie to be faithful as well. But there are going to be changes. And changes like this - which don't have any impact on the story, and simply serve to create an iconic image are fine. <br />
<br />
If you want to complain about anything, complain about retconning Durotan into the War. IIRC the Frostwolves are exiled shortly after the Orcs cross the DP in the game canon. It would have been interesting to have Grommash be the Orc protagonist, but I can understand that they might want that linkage with Thrall if they want to continue the films further. Also making the good orcs brown skinned irks me. It's a cliche way to separate the good guys and the bad guys and it strips away some of the moral ambiguity which this film should focus on.</div></div><hr />

If he could write a sign in the sand to destroy a city dozens of kilometers away, I believe he will be able to write a sign in the sand to destroy a city dozens of kilometers in the air. <br />

And why people is so eager to believe Blizzard is actually making the movie? What's so hard to understand that they sold the rights to Legendary and Universal? Blame Duncan Jones or the story writers.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I totally agree. It makes sense when considering what they're trying to accomplish with this film. After all, it has to be assumed that the majority of viewers haven't played the original Warcraft rts games or read the relative novels, and thus, would not be familiar with the overarching narrative. <br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is the most popular entry in the series, so it makes sense to include aspects of the franchise's current era in the movie adaptation, potentially making it a more relatable experience for a larger majority of viewers. Whether this would be done in the way Styvan01 mentioned; having the first war segment depicted through a tale or flashback, or even in the complete opposite fashion, depicting brief flash-forwards to our present time, if executed well, it could work to enhance the overall experience for all audiences.<br />
On that note, it's also worth taking WoD's current storyline into consideration. It certainly could be possible that the movie has been written using the safer route of having it take place in an alternate timeline, as to please both fans and the unfamiliar alike.<br />
<br />
All in all, while I understand that Hollywood has a very broad tract-record in regards to alterations in existing stories, I wouldn't jump to conclusions just yet, at least not until we have more context on the matter. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically, those who work on the movie, are ignorant brats with no soul. Damn I would be so happy if Blizzard just literally posted now that the movie is extended by 3 years and they have a new studio working on the movie.<br />
<br />
I've played the game for 8 years, stayed subed for almost the whole time. Bought every expansion, bought some stuff from store and used some of their services. Yes that's a LOT of money. And I don't deserve to watch the trailer? I mean, the virtual ticket isn't super cheap, if it was like 2$ I'd MAYBE understand it, like MAYBE. But it's WAY more then that. So obviously, Blizzard doesn't care enough about their costumers.<br />
<br />
I didn't purchase the virtual ticket since I couldn't afford it, but it's just the most shittiest thing Blizzard can do. I'm actually really glad I didn't purchase it, they didn't even show anything interesting at Blizzcon except the movie, and that was not available for virtual ticket. Only thing they showed at Blizzcon was, a shitty game that's coming, some info on Diablo 3 patch which was nothing more then just info they could've posted online and nothing else interesting.<br />
<br />
Also did they mention they wouldn't show movie trailer for those who were watching with the virtual ticket?<br />
<br />
Oh, another special snowflake. I bought both the virtual ticket, have played longer than you, and have bought/played every blizzard game since Warcraft 1. It sucks but you don't see me complaining like I'm entitled to see it. <br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard doesn't &quot;own&quot; the movie or &quot;pay&quot; people working on the movie. They own the Intellectual Property... Legendary is producing the movie. Is it that complicated?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also Blizzcon annouced 3 new games/expansions - Overwatch, Legacy of the Void, and Gnomes and Goblins. It has a bunch of good panels for WoW (as well as their other games), a cool documentary, info on the movie (they showed off costumes and weapons), etc etc. To be honest I've watched almost every Blizzcon and this was one of the better ones, unless all you care about is WoW.</div></div><hr />

Novel to movie adaptations are always changed, just like video game to movie adaptations. Nothing is always exactly the same.

In this case, they obviously want to make a couple changes to make the visual style of the world match that of WoW a bit more. The reason is obvious: They want all sorts of people to point at the screen and say &quot;I KNOW THAT PLACE&quot;, and not just lore nerds like myself. :P<br />
<br />
We already knew that Dalaran would be flying when they first showed the first concept arts for the movie (It was a mockup of Teldrassil and Dalaran). You literally had years to get used to the idea. It's silly, yes, it makes the Warcraft 2 Orc invasion and then Arthas ransacking it a teeny bit weird, true, but not impossible. If the city already flying is the greatest change they made when it comes to the plot of these games that I hold near and dear to my heart, I think we've gotten off easy.<br />
<br />
Just take a look at the Potter or LotR movies. The amount of corners cut is disgusting from a purist's point, but they still were enjoyed by a mass market, and those that made them were enthusiastic and fans of what they were making!<br />
<br />
As someone who still wasn't able to beat the optimism out of himself, I have big hopes for the Warcraft movie.<br />
<br />
If there is a sequel and it does not have battle turtles with rocket launchers attached to their backs, however, I shall be sorely pissed. ;)<br />
<br />
All that's left now is to combine those fan images with warcraft music and some voice-acting, and we're all set for a mock-up trailer! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, believe it because that's how it is. Look for the movie credits. <br />
<br />
That's how movies work, for example: The movie &quot;The Fault in our Star&quot; was based on a book written by John Green. John Green had little to do with the production and filming of the movie, actually during one of his videos he expressed how relieved he was when he finally got to see the full finished movie because it succeeded in capturing the essence of the book. But he didn't fund it, didn't produce it and had little role in the filming process; he only owns the Intellectual Property.<br />
<br />
And that's how 99% of film works when the creative source sells or leases the rights of their IP to a film studio to make a movie. Legendary bought the rights so they are allowed take some liberties. We do not know how much they can change though, that depends of what the contract states, and those details only some Blizzard, Legendary and Universal employees and lawyers know.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can make suggestions or have a consulting role, but Legendary makes the decisions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoce6e4ec6ff7</div><div class="date">2014-11-28, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Butcher it how? It's just a nice change to make the city feel like actual city of magic. A single picture can say more than a hundred words, and that is the case for flying Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Besides, tons of mages, including the most powerful ones, were killed when Arthas attacked Dalaran, and even those that survived were able to make it fly a few years later. This means they probably could have easily made it happen when mages like Antonidas were still alive. Before you pull the Scourge card - they haven't done it in the Third War because they thought that their defenses are way more than enough, and since Arthas was fixed on taking Dalaran at all costs, it seemed like a great opportunity to wipe out most of his forces with little risk. <br />
<br />
So... they are not really butchering the lore in this case.<br />
<br />
Retconning huge segments of lore to do stuff that looks cool.<br />
<br />
Some fine storytelling there.<br />
<br />
Nah, fuck that. If they're fucking the lore there's no point seeing it, for me at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So really when you have have set yourself a set amount of movie run time you have to cram as much interesting stuff as you can in it and since it seems to be about two hours or so that they have set for it you have to get as much out of it while making it interesting and not crap..</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's intended to be a portal from Draenor to TI, but the other way around. As the post says, it's impossible to reach the Gorgrond side without flying in the shredder. (So, in other words, not really intended to be reached at all.) Either way, though, it's not convenient, so it's probably just meant to be a little fun easter egg of sorts. I had wondered what the point of that cave on the Isle was during MoP. I went with three friends and we all sat in the chairs to see if something happened, but nothing did back then. I wonder if this was planned or not.<br />
<br />
After I found out about this teleport I wanted to test it. I still have a couple of characters at 90 that I haven't started WoD with yet so I went with one to the Isle. Yes, the portal from the Isle to Gorgrond works even though I haven't set foot in Draenor on that character yet. Of course that immediate area is littered with level 100s so it's not terribly useful...</div></div><hr />

No one actually gives a shit about our derivative, convoluted lore. Even most WoW players don't give a shit. For this movie to be a success, and for us to ever see an Arthas movie, we can't just appeal to WoW nerds. We need to bring in other movie goers. A floating Dalaran is not a sign that it will be a bad movie. Calm. Down. Lore doesn't make a good story: good acting, pacing, plotting and dialogue does. It's just a cool floating city.

Totally agreed. I just told my sister about floating Dalaran, and she decided to buy out an entire theater room just to see the movie with all her friends next year. And none of them have even played Warcraft before.<br />
<br />
Normal Dalaran was, to be it bluntly, boring as fuck. This change is going to increase the sales of the movie by at least 30%, possibly more. Brilliant move by Legendary Pictures.</div></div><hr />

God fucking damn, I knew those idiots would butcher the lore. This is my you shouldn't let clueless idiots make movies out of your property.<br />
<br />
Comments like this just make my brain hurt. Blizzard retcons lore to such a degree on the regular that it has no meaning, but people have problems with slight retcons in a movie adaptation? Hell, Dalaran always being a floating city makes a whole hell of a lot more sense than a supposedly destroyed city (seriously, how much more clearly could Warcraft III made it that Dalaran was completely destroyed by Archimonde?) being yanked out of the ground and moved halfway across the world. It was a particularly silly moment in a franchise with a whole lot of them, but you are so married to that mangled lore that any small deviation for a film has you completely write it off? Yeah, good luck with that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astalnar</div><div class="date">2014-11-29, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't believe my eyes. Yes, we do get it (http://cogitationesastalnaris.blogspot.com/2014/11/thoughts-on-warcraft-film-based-on.html). There will be changes, there will be deviations from the source material. But adding Dalaran and changing orcs from green to brown is not a deviation, that is complete and utter disregard for the lore. The problem is not with the fact that Dalaran is flying during the First War. The problem is that Dalaran is even shown in the film focusing about FIRST WAR. The First War was fought between the (Old) Horde, and the Kingdom of Stormwind. Nobody else even cought the wind of it, until orcs already won and first refugees came to Lordaeron.<br />
<br />
You know how they described Warcraft film on a Blizzcon 2013? Avatar meets Game of Thrones (http://cogitationesastalnaris.blogspot.com/2013/11/second-look.html). Well, according to the art depicted here and the scenes in trailer it is far from that. It is far more accurate to say Eragon meets Clash of the Titans. Oh, look, another two great hits who wanted to appeal to the broader audience not with staying loyal to the original story (in CotT the myth about Perseus), but with CGI and other special effects. You notice what happened to those two? They FLOPPED.<br />
<br />
So please do continue like that, support the butchering and utter disregard for already established lore. Do go on and offer that lore and established storyline as a sacrificial lamb to the clueless masses in order to garner some broad appeal. It is sure way of how to ensure that Warcraft film does not get any sequel and people continue to believe how it is impossible to make a good film based on a videogame.<br />
<br />
Here is a thought experiment for all of you in favour of deviations. You have all probably seen The Hobbit. We can all agree that Jackson deviates quite a lot from the established story, and while he gets some serious flak from the fans of the book, the masses are pleased. Now imagine, Jackson brought back the Ringwraiths in Hobbit, and they were chasing dwarves left and right. How would that &quot;deviation&quot; from the established story sit with you?<br />
<br />
There is a strong and stark distinction between a simple deviation from the story, and the butchering of it. Legolas jumping over dwarven heads is acceptable deviation for some, addition of Ringwraiths chasing after Blibo and 13 dwarves is butchering of the story, and has no place in Hobbit. Same goes for Dalaran, and brown orcs in Warcraft film about First War.</div></div><hr />

Many MANY kudos to Mr. Zhang for trying to share a taste of the trailer with us plebs who couldn't go to Blizzcon hahah. The artwork is quite lovely. My favorites would probably be the way he drew Durotan, followed by the sketch of the three elves. (Wut, I like my elves. XDD)<br />

!!! I used to go to that nifty cave on the Timeless Isle from time to time! Now I finally know what it's for.. GOING from time to time (and place :P)!

You sir are a giant moron,sorry to say but you are,Dalaran is more than just a flying city,it has been in nearly all of the storylines and is very important for progressing the lore,it makes no sense to be in the sky as it didnt have a purpose in the first war,just because you found something boring doesnt mean changing it will bring in more punters.

<br />
For some of you it's a short journey, cheap journey to get there and just the ticket cost, the rest of us would be looking at hundreds in travelling costs and god knows how much for a hotel room for a night or two. It just isn't practical for the majority of us<br />
<br />
It's really not Blizzard's call. Legendary didn't want to show footage that isn't quite finished as when THAT gets on the internet, someone will inevitably complain. Don't forget this movie is scheduled for Spring 2016. I'm sure we'll get a very nice trailer in due time when it's actually gone through the whole process.<br />

<br />
Awesome art, and I am immensly grateful to the author of all these pictures. But if we take these pictures for truth, then it stands that the film is deviating from already established lore. Orcs, at that point standing beefore the Dark Portal should already be green, Durotan included. Now, it might be the artist's own vision, but I think s/he would colour them correctly.<br />
<br />
Another thing are high elves in the picture 11. Based on the surroundings and other pictures we can only assume this is meant to be High Elves of Dalaran. Well, the problem is that Dalaran did not get involved in the First War. Hell, nobody on Azeroth aside from Stormwind took part in the First War. Another thing about Dalaran that makes me question how very loyal filmmakers are to the lore is the fact that there is picture showing Dalaran FLYING. Dalaran did not move anywhere until they moved it to Northrend.<br />
<br />
I don't care how visually impressive the whole thing looks. I want it to be &quot;historically&quot; accurate. Seriously, with addition of Dalaran you are only making things complicated to those that don't know Warcraft. The point of First War, and making a filmabout it, is that it is great introduction. You have orcs, you have humans, and they are at war. And with the future wars the setting gets larger, as they add high elves, dwarves, Dalaran, other human kingdoms and so forth.<br />
<br />
Uh, the Mag'Har/Frostwolves of Nagrand never drink the demon blood and as such only start turning green a few days before the opening iirc. It appears as if the orc is watching high above the construction of the portal itself.<br />
<br />
Dalaran (and later Silvermoon) were briefly involved once the orcs started going northwards. As for flying Dalaran I am either assuming they will make it flying due to the title 'Magical City of Dalaran' - it needs to appear magical because they just HAVE TO make it work without prior knowledge of the universe, it's the very first. The other variant is as someone said, it's from a flash-forward/flashback.<br />
<br />
Once again as in my previous point, they can't cram the entire lore into one 2 hour movie. It needs to be a ) split-up b ) friendly to the general public so it doesn't flop c ) appear interesting to everyone so they are ok burning more money on a sequel/prequel/whatever<br />

I answered a similar concern above, but I'll do it again, all of the lore cannot be crammed into one movie, it needs to be split up. Nobody is going to make a sequel if the first movie flops (which it will if the general public has abso-fucking-lutely no idea what this is even about.<br />

Dalaran flying is stupid as hell. What happens if we make it to the WC3 story? Does Archimonde just shoot a super duper laser at it in the sky instead of inscribing a rune in the sand and making it collapse as such? Seems really stupid, but it's probably a Metzen thing. &quot;Dalaran should always be flying 'cause it's magic and shit man. This movie is like Ultimate Warcraft!&quot; It's like he gets to make all the shitty little retcons he ever wanted to make.<br />
<br />
How does the way Archimonde crush Dalaran change based on the location? He did it with a powerful eredar rune magic, it can be fuckin underwater and it'd still work.<br />

There is a strong and stark distinction between a simple deviation from the story, and the butchering of it. Legolas jumping over dwarven heads is acceptable deviation for some, addition of Ringwraiths chasing after Blibo and 13 dwarves is butchering of the story, and has no place in Hobbit. Same goes for Dalaran, and brown orcs in Warcraft film about First War.<br />
<br />
Alright, I have many, many problems with this comment. Firstly, Peter Jackson 100% butchers the Hobbit, and if you'd actually read the book, or the Appendices which a lot of the Hobbit trilogy is based on, you'd be able to figure that out. There was no place for any dwarf or elf romance, no place for any unrealistic dragon and dwarf fight scene, or action barrel scene. Those scenes would have never been approved by Tolkien (while any change in the LOTR movies would be, I'm guessing, acceptable in Tolkien's eyes because it does not make it differ in tone).<br />
<br />
Second off, you and I don't know jackshit about the movie, because not a lot of info has been released to the press except for some concept art, the BASIC plot of it, and a trailer that has never been released. So you don't know how the lore will be changed or if it will be for the good or bad. I hate purists as much as any rationale man does, but I can at least understand why people would get upset by a change in the LOTR or Hobbit movies, because everything Tolkien did, he did for a specific reason. Here with Warcraft and WoW however, the quality of the lore doesn't match up to Tolkien WHATSOEVER, and it's clear that the actual creators of the lore don't care about it because they keep on changing it whenever they feel like it.<br />
<br />
Despite the quality of the lore is mediocre, I feel Duncan Jones will be able to manipulate and trim it to make it feel like LOTR. I also think every change he makes from the lore will be done for a good reason, for storytelling purposes and whatnot, so don't overreact when ONE thing that is changed and has nothing to do with the overall plot.</div></div><hr />
