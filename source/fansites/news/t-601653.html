<br />
<br />
<br />
World<br />
Dalaran will be moved and hover above Northrend. It will be used as a neutral capital city.<br />
There are more daily quests coming in the next patch-- a dungeon daily quest, a battleground daily quest, and a cooking daily quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Instances<br />
A new 25 man dungeon is scheduled for release after Zul'aman, it will have 6 bosses with loots higher than tier 6. Another 5-man instance is also considered. (This will be before the expansion)<br />
There will be a new CoT instance in the expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Heroic badge loot will be added to the game with Zul'Aman<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are we going to have to buy new flying mounts again? <br />
Laughter. You'll not &quot;have&quot; to buy a new flying mount, but we'll have new options available.<br />
<br />
Will green items in Northrend be better than Tier 4? <br />
Yes, we do expect to see the same kind of progression. We were happy overall with the way it worked. If you're decked out in Illidan gear or the new raid zone that I can't mention just yet that will be out before the expansion (!), that gear will last you a while. But players like upgrades early and often.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
New Battleground<br />
Siege vehicles that you can drive around<br />
15 People in each team<br />
30~40 minutes long games.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Arena Season<br />
New Season<br />
New Arena<br />
New Gear<br />
<br />
<br />
There will also be a new Outdoor non-instanced world PVP Zone with impact on the whole world. (Even for PVE Servers)<br />
<br />
Hero Classes<br />
Hero Classes won't be released all at once because of balancing issues. They're classic Warcraft 3 characters with an &quot;epic feel&quot; (something really different than the ordinary)<br />
<br />
The hero class will be created on a new character slot once you completed the quest, you won't lose your original character.<br />
<br />
Death Knight<br />
The current plan is to have the class available for all races.<br />
Designed to fullfill both tanking and DPS roles<br />
Can tank using 2H weapons or by Dual-Wielding, no need for shields.<br />
Rather than using rage, energy, or mana, Death Knights have a special &quot;rune sword&quot; displayed beneath their health bar, onto which the player can etch six different runes (choose between Frost, Blood, and Unholy).<br />
Rune resource system. Three rune schools: Blood runes, frost, and unholy runes. All DK spells and abilities will use these different runes in some combo. DKs carve these runes into their weapon-- done anytime outside of combat.<br />
Character portrait has six runes in place of the mana bar (and a special circle around the icon, probably for Hero class). These runes are consume as your spells use them-- they deactivate and then reactivate over time, so if you have two frost and four blood runes, you get that much to use as spells and abilities. We have plans for mechanics that allow you to change one resource type on the fly-- like Warlock's Life Tap (Health=mana).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unholy Embrace<br />
Instant Cast. 5 min cooldown.<br />
Target is embraced by a silhouette of darkness for 6 seconds, corrupting any healing spells and effects cast upon or currently affecting the target to cause damage for 50% of their healing potential instead of restoring health. Any damage shields cast upon or currently affecting the target will also be instantly consumed, dealing 50% of their absorption potential in damage. Once afflicted with Unholy Embrace, the target cannot be afflicted with Unholy Embrace again for 1 minute.<br />

About flying mounts, I don't reckon they will work in Northrend, seeing as in the video the players are riding epic land mounts. You never know, but I would've thought they'd use flying mounts at least once. Of course, there is still a lot of time left 'till the release so all of this could change. I guess we'll find out whether or not flying mounts work or not very soon due to people playing the exp. pack with their own characters.</div></div><hr />

I'm 90% sure they'll give flying mounts @ lvl 80, learning the new skin, buying the azerothian mount etc. etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and i think that a limitation to the ground may decrease transportation speed <br />
<br />
but would make the gaming experience more interesting while leveling in new zones. To have some obstacles, cliffs, bridges, small pathways in the mountains could be really intense, <br />
<br />
to not fly anywhere you want the day you enter northrend. No direct flying to questmobs and leaving all else out... once finished leveling would be a good point to make travelling easier by flying mounts or other means...<br />
<br />
So yes i like flying, but i think it is more fun to first explore on foot</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if they can keep that up with each new expansion, though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxtro</div><div class="date">2007-08-03, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't be surprised if it was required to be level 80 so you can use your flying mounts in Northrend. Maybe like an 8k cost for the next level of riding skill?<br />
<br />
I don't think we will be seeing any Netherdrakes outside of Outland. The dragons shown in the trailer are most likely normal dragons. I'm sure there will be quests about them espically in the Dragonblight zone, the place where all dragons go to die. Hopefully we can interact with Malygos in some way and no I don't mean kill him.<br />
<br />
It is kind of lame that this xpack is newcomer and alt unfriendly. I still think that a great sea expansion would have new races and new zones to level up in. And it will probably have water mounts that can swim on the surface and under the sea ;D</div></div><hr />

Don't know if they could/would make it level restrictive to summon a type of mount in certain areas. They could easily make a new skill level trainable only at 80 that allows use of those mounts outside Outland, but how much would they dare charge for it? Especially since it would screw those who only trained 225 riding for normal flyers... they'd have to save and blow the (new adjusted) amount for 300 then also whatever outrageous price for 375 just to use a normal flyer there?<br />
<br />
My bet would be either freedom to fly (it's a new continent on a new world server so the Azeroth problems won't be there) period, or permanent flight restriction explained as strong arctic winds making flight impossible - although we know there are dragons there and apparently (at work) have seen one flying above in the stuff on the official site... and that could be an argument for a new skill level... you need to learn how to navigate the harsher air above Northrend before you and your mount can handle it.</div></div><hr />

I have a mind that blizz will gather up Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms and Northrend in one world server and would allow players to fly between them with 450 riding skill.</div></div><hr />

you'll be able to access it from the ground and also with your flying mount.<br />
i guess there will be pretty good chances that we can use our flying mounts there, tho maybe not right away</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My intrigue lies especially in the hero class, and in the chance that there might be other similar to Deathknight. I myself rolled a pally way back when and soon grew tired of the oh-I'm-so-fancy type it displayed. Deathknight would be the answer to my prayers :D<br />
<br />
I hope each class will have a hero-class aswell (druids -&gt; Keepers of the Grove?) as there is so much still left in the Warcraft lore that has not yet been integrated into the lore and would indeed make some quite awesome conversions.<br />
<br />
I suddenly want myself an undead warlock, since that thing with Sylvanas sounds pretty damn nice. :D<br />
<br />
I personally am going to start at that Fjord-place, due to the fancyabulously jagged buildings and norse'esque setting. I've already struck a deal with a good friend of mine to duo to 80. I just hope I can get a few toons up to 70 before the expansion though.<br />

PS: <br />
So, I've read that bit about Dalaran here twice now... I take it there's nothing in the big purple bubble (except perhaps a vacuum)? The spell they cast moved the city to above Northrend? <br />
I suspect the lore'll describe the magics somewhere along these lines:<br />
&quot;To strengthen the drained power of Arthas the Lich King, he used dark magics to corrupt and persuade a group of Dalaran wizards to channel a spell to restore the fallen city to it's former glory. Little did the wizards know that the spell that was supposed to be used to transport the city back to the time before the destruction, the city was moved to the continent of Northrend, where the Lich King drains the powers of this magical city.&quot;<br />
Sorry for the sucky story, just felt I should cook something up :-[<br />
<br />
PPS: <br />
*Expanding character customisation options including new hairstyles &amp; dances, the ability to change the hairstyles of existing characters, and new skin color variants.<br />

-Cant use a flying mount in northern. if you read the description it says &quot;can only be used in the outlands.&quot; Northern is in azeroth. A new mount can only be some soart of creater to help you travel trough water and snow<br />
-the death knight is the hero class from the paladin (wich can be understandable from the movie) since death knights are corrupted paladins<br />
-Maybe there might be 2 kinds of each hero class for each class. for example:<br />
<br />
l-Death Knight<br />
Paladin--<br />
l-Holy knight<br />
<br />
I dont think all paladins will wish to become a death knight, some might want to continue being our healbots.;p<br />
I guess there can be 2 kinds of hero class for each, a good one and a evil one.</div></div><hr />

they said they'd be used in Northrend<br />

And northrend is not in Azeroth TECHNICALLY it'll be in its own instance just like Outland/Quel'Thalas/Azuremyst was.</div></div><hr />

It's not like Warrior &gt; Death Knight or Paladin &gt; Death Knight. It's a distinct class. You do a questline (that does not involve raiding) and it will unlock the ability to roll a Death Knight (which will start in the 60s or 70s).</div></div><hr />

Curious. Do they mean the new Arena Season will start w/ WotLK's release? If so, I'd say we've got about the length of one Arena Season until we visit the land of icy death. I guess if a season is rougly 5-6 months, that would put it Q1 2008. Just an observation, not speculation.<br />

Makes sense. They said they would release an x-pack every year. Same time or even date as BC would work. Also, you have to realize all the stuff they learned from creating BC and now that they don't have another Race and starting zones and new zones to design, they can pump out the content much faster. Not to mention all the cash inflow they are getting now from BC and undoubtedly from WotLK will let them hire more and better ppl to get the ideas flowing and the job done.</div></div><hr />

Flying mounts are unable to be used in azeroth..not cause blizzard just dosent want them to be. Azeroth was built before the 3d technology was created, its totally 2d. a pillar you look at is hollow inside, However outlands is not, it was designed with flying mounts in mind. If you fly over stormwind the map will become distorted and you will be able to see through to the underside of SW this is why flying mounts cannot be used and blizzard isnt about to spend a year redoing azeroth to accomidate for theses mounts. Northrend is not part of the azeroth maps...it will have its own maps..much like outlands, Quel'thas does. Northrend will be build with the new graphic design and flying mounts will be able yo be used there. As for people saying that when you click the item &quot;this can only be used in outlands&quot; your stupid...no northrend content has been released into the game so no objects would be modifyed to suit the new expansion.<br />

There is a simple line of code you can add to one of the files in your wow folder that allows you to zoom out as far as you want, ive zoomed out to 250yards before in storm wind and it looks no different than if you were able to fly there. So, i don't think there is some fundamental difference between the modeling of Outlands vs. Azeroth. <br />
<br />
The problem is not one of 2d vs 3d the problem is when you zoom out to some areas in Azeroth using the method I described, you see areas where Blizzard simply has not added any texture, or where lines don't align, or where there are holes. It just looks sloppy in many places. This is because no flight paths flew near by to those areas and they Blizzard did not expect people to be able to see them. Its not because they are 2D, they are clearly 3d. To fix those areas would require Blizzard to go and retexture large swaths of Azeroth, but they wouldnt have to completely reprogram it. <br />
<br />
Obviously it can be done because you do Fly in Azeroth, of course only on flightpaths. Also, for a little while in the BC beta didnt they have a bug where people were able to fly in Azeroth?<br />
<br />
And no, I won't say how to do the zoom out hack as I think it probably violates the ToS and could probably lead to your account being banned.</div></div><hr />

Yup,<br />
<br />
I saw that too, they did an overlay with both maps and highlighted the changes. There are several reasons for the changes, and it may well be just to fascilitate later additions to the game. Eitherway, I'm in no rush to find out as am still having fun in Outland!</div></div><hr />
