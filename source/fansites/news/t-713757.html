On a serious note - It's been quite a lot of years since that zone was an actual Blasted Land. 33 to be exact. Considering WoW is in a fantasy universe and &quot;healing&quot; isn't what healing is in RL I'd say that 33 years is plenty for anything to grow back and revitilize.<br />
<br />
Edit: Well, actually, since I couldn't really find a proper source I'd say it's about 33 years since the opening of the portal. But consider this: from the fall of Angrathar to the retaking of Undercity the time that passed was around 7 years, from what I recall. It's somewhere in the quest descriptions during the chain or in the constant NPC talking during the events. Can't quite remember.</div></div><hr />

They're fine. No rules saying that the portals have to be the same size. The one in Hellfire would be too big for Blasted Lands anyway I think.<br />

<br />
I don't see where's the difference of opinions here. It's just that Desolace had no outside influence on its... lifelessness whereas the Blasted Lands were like that because of the portal and the constant wars and demonic corruption. Worgen can of course play a huge role on its healing</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blasted lands is as big as Blizz decided for it to be at the time...but in tbc they supersized the dark portal once one enters outlands to show how they really envisioned it. A massive gate, fit to have legions of orcs marching through conquering worlds. Now, it would be really weird to have those ranks of orcs squished once they stand on the gate on the other side, ingame that is, had the blasted lands portal been done when the outlands was being done then no doubt, they would have been of equal size.<br />
<br />
I disagree, the tbc portal could easily fit into blasted lands, there's just desert n some hills there anyways, also, was never a popular zone in vanilla, so I don't see what would be a big loss. They are changing quests anyways for Cata...</div></div><hr />

Uh, I never said overhauling a zone wasn't impressive. I actually specifically noted that it's very cool, if you paid an iota of attention to my post.<br />

I said that the graphics in that screenshot are nothing new except for the water engine. Fog, WOTLK. Trees, vanilla-quality. Terrain and water, vanilla specular. Ground texture, WOTLK quality. Shadows, implemented in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
It's really just WOTLK, with some vanilla, and some new water.<br />

You said nothing but the water was that impressive... therein stating that nothing but the water is impressive, including the zone overhaul which you said was awesome but nothing more. Hence, my rebuttal. Regardless of what textures are new or not, it IS impressive how much of a difference the zone has gone through so far and does deserve the 'gawking' people are making over it.</div></div><hr />

I have played the game from the start, the ground was changed over n over again in vanilla in different zones, they do that sometimes, never in patch notes. I don't see why they shouldn't change the ground as they see fit to make it work for Cataclysm. The shape of zones reflect mostly places to quest, so if the zone changes n new quests emerge, then it makes sense that the ground should change too, if the castle has been moved a few yards, who cares??</div></div><hr />

Hence, my rebuttal. Regardless of what textures are new or not, it IS impressive how much of a difference the zone has gone through so far and does deserve the 'gawking' people are making over it. <br />
<br />
Yes, I did say &quot;aside from the new water engine nothing in that screenshot is that impressive&quot;. I did not state nothing but the water was impressive. I said that nothing but the water was as impressive as everyone is making it out to be. If 0% is not impressive and 100% is how impressed everyone is, I actually implied something closer to 50% impressiveness rather than 0%.<br />
<br />
Yes, it looks like they're making some great visual changes regarding the overall look of the zone. But I never put down that aspect, so stop with the pathetic strawman.<br />
<br />
I'm obviously referring to the comments mentioning they think they will need a new rig to run the zone, or that it looks of cinematic quality, so I'm not sure what you think your argument has to do with anything.</div></div><hr />

well, they better FOOKIN do it for Outlands too, I don't care what othes say, but Nagrand is the best zone ever created n I want to see the new water effects there. If that happens, I'll have a nerdgasm.</div></div><hr />

My OP was no less clear than posts praising the screenshot. For example, many posts are vague in that they merely mention how great it looks. They do not specifically point out what looks good. My post is somewhat vague but more specific than most in that I mention most of the screenshot would run on any system that can handle vanilla. I even specifically mentioned specular lighting. Again, you are using strawman. I didn't in the least suggest that the developers are &quot;not putting much effort into the game&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I was clear. You're right my post could easily be miss-understood, but that's really because most people have poor reading comprehension, and isn't an issue with the clarity of the OP.</div></div><hr />

Don't assume we're the one's with the reading comprehension just because you weren't entirely clear in your post and people notice it and make comments toward it. <br />
<br />
Notice I wasn't saying you were discrediting the work done, simply that people do that and when people make comments like your original post it's easy to assume that you are one of these type of people who simple like to draw out the negativity due to your bias or whatever opinions you may have of the game. I didn't at all say that you were one of these people, just that these people exist and your vague post is easy to mislead people into thing that you are that type of person. Don't take it as an insult because it wasn't, I'm simply pointing out somewhat obvious signs that others pick up on that you obviously didn't. <br />
<br />
So again, check who might have the reading comprehension here and stop assuming we're idiots when your post was vague and quite misleading from your original intentions.</div></div><hr />

And Greenland is covered in ice, and New York isn't new anymore. So what? They're just names. Fact is, if you change the names, then people have no basis for comparison with Vanilla. I could see the Plaguelands being renamed Lordaeron, or perhaps subzones like the Tainted Scar being renamed...but honestly, it's not a big deal to keep the old names.

Yeah, but Azeroth behave like anyplace else absent conscious effort by persons or creatures of power. Tree still take a long time to grow unless a Druid causes them to grow faster, or spirit inhabit them or something. When something unatural happens in WoW it's because someone or something caused it to happen, not just because Azeroth isn't Earth.

Yes, because Everquest looks -so- good. *cough* (Worst graphics I've seen in an MMO.)<br />

<br />
<br />
How did trees grow that fast? Are we going into the future like, 100 years?<br />
<br />
Still, looks awesome.<br />

Rampant magic, perhaps? People should stop treating WoW like a realistic universe when it's not:p<br />

Q. Regarding Cataclysm, can you reveal any of the 'major changes' in Blasted Lands and how this will affect the lore? <br />
A. I love the fact that one of our first questions is in regards to the Blasted Lands! We have big plans in store for this zone in Cataclysm. We will be revamping the entire flow of the zone so you can expect an entirely new experience here. Some of the big changes include an opening to the coastline for a new play area, as well as a large new worgen area in The Tainted Scar.<br />

If i recall, the scythe of elune was taken by karazhan death knights. The scythe of elune, has the power to summon worgens from their homeworld, i see this as an artifact that Worgens trying to find a cure for their curse, may just want. Basement of karazhan instance?</div></div><hr />

I know in time all land can heal and lets not forget this change is not from one day to another in certain areas you do quests to heal the land and it looks like with the cataclysm you get to see the fruits of your efforts <br />

<br />
Makes sense since the entire top part of Kara is replicated in the basement (At least thats what the book said right?), always wandered why they didnt do anything with the bottom part, especially since thats where medivh died. Maybe we will see Khadgar come back? Why is the one of the most powerful mages ever living in outlands still? <br />

They really need to update trees textures.<br />

It's just an improved water shader that's all. Same flat surface, new shader. The rest of the word in the screenshot is as retarded as WoW ever was. Same bricky ugly trees with mega-huge pixels of a tiny texture stretched upon them, same retarded grass made off of 2 crossed patches each instead of, you know, shaders, like any remotely modern game does, even the cheapest ones.<br />
<br />
All they have done there is changed how the water texture is being rendered, that's all. And it's one of the basic and core functions that have been there since directx9 or even 7. And it's not gonna put your hardware on its knees because your video card is supposed to process shaders, those huge powers that you paid your money for and which were never used by WoW for more than 10%</div></div><hr />

There are thousands people that know just as much as i am and would point out that there wasnt much changes at all, and that said water is nothing uber fancy. Guess what, blizzard can't hire thousands of people to do their job. They feed their own crew you know.
