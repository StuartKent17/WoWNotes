Sloot (https://twitter.com/Slootbag) was back today with another WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/with_replies) interview!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v84678318&amp;!autoplay&amp;t=1h55m&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Raid Addon Utility and Changes<br />
<br />
Addons that do things like tracking boss timers and better visibility on who is being targeted by what are fine, it is all informational. <br />
Some of the things that addons do that interact with the 3D world such as radars or sending people to specific spots on Mythic Kormrok and Kromog are not great. <br />
You could have much more scripted movement with the current state of addons, micromanaging your raid's movement and telling players exactly where to move in the 3D world. <br />
In Patch 7.1, addons will not be able to access unit position in raids, dungeons, and competitive instances. <br />
The team wanted to get this in Patch 7.0.3, but they didn't want to break some mods that are harmless in the outdoor world, such as the ones that help with gathering or collecting treasures. <br />
Anything that projects an arrow on your screen that interacts with the 3D world or giving you your position relative to others will be broken. <br />
The team didn't want to announce this until they were sure it was doable, but that work has now been done internally. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
There will be spots throughout dungeons where Demon Hunters can take some shortcuts, but your healer can't be a Demon Hunter.<br />
Part of why the team never fixed some of the terrain in Everbloom is the challenge mode leaderboard. Fixing it would make the top times unbeatable. <br />
With Mythic keystones, every week is its own leaderboard, so there is more flexibility to fix any issues with the dungeon.<br />
There is some tuning left to do on the enemy forces meters so that you can't skip too much of the dungeon. <br />
You should have to fight most of the things in your path, dodging patrols and maybe some other groups. <br />
Stealth or invisibility potions should allow you to change which groups you have to fight, maybe skipping some tougher ones to do easier ones.<br />
Having new and different mechanics in higher raid difficulties gives the team more tuning knobs and players something to look forward to other than bigger numbers.<br />
Rare mobs in dungeons that are part of the world quest system should be rewarding even if you are a player that is still leveling and doesn't have access to the world quest yet. This way going to kill the mob is still rewarding for the entire group. <br />
<br />
<br />
Camera Zoom<br />
<br />
The team wants something to feel epic, even at a larger zoom distance, so they scale things up. Things have been huge throughout WoW's history. <br />
Threats that are off screen that you need to pay attention to are trivialized if you can just zoom out to see them. <br />
The team has to tune those kind of threats around a certain camera zoom distance. <br />
If zooming out even more by setting the cvar gives you an advantage, does that make it required? <br />
In a world where you can zoom the camera out and the mechanic is tuned around people doing that, not doing so penalizes you significantly. <br />
Motion sickness and other issues that caused discomfort while playing led to the team trying to find a compromise that let everyone play comfortably. <br />
The team strongly feels that the game looks and feels better at the maximum zoom allowed by the UI. <br />
The new max zoom distance wasn't added to the slider because it will increase the number of people that are experiencing the game in a sub-optimal way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Loot Rules<br />
<br />
With new personal loot rules, you can trade an item to another person in the raid if you have an equivalent or higher item level. You can't do this for bonus rolled loot. <br />
The cooperative nature of group and guild gameplay leads to you wanting to pass an item you don't need to a friend. Personal loot denied you this opportunity until this change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic+ Dungeons<br />
<br />
The best loot from Mythic+ dungeons comes from the weekly chest. <br />
The loot that you are getting out of Mythic+ dungeons per clear will need a fair bit of luck to compete with the very best loot in the game. <br />
Most players are not going to farm alts and source multiple fresh keystones on a regular basis to play a ton of Mythic+ dungeons. <br />
The Mythic+ dungeon shouldn't be worse for the average player in order to safeguard against exploits or abuse of the system at the high end by a minority of players. <br />
The team didn't want to be overly stingy with a new system, instead allowing players to have freedom, finding the abuse cases, and solving them with targeted fixes. <br />
A weekly lockout is an easy solution, but everyone would complete their mythic dungeons at the start of the week and then everyone else would have trouble finding a group. <br />
There is a possibility that chests at the end of each Mythic+ dungeon run are a little bit too rewarding right now in terms of a guaranteed item for everyone in the group. It should be a complement to raiding, not the best way to gear up early on. <br />
The number of items that come out of the chest might change before it goes live. Maybe there are always a couple of items in the chest for the group rather than one for everyone. <br />
Mythic+ dungeons are cross-realm. The realm first achievement (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/11224-realm-first-keystone-master) will be awarded to each player in a five player group that is made up of players from different realms, but this could change to something like 3/5 people being from the same realm to get it. <br />
If a player hasn't unlocked Arcway and Court of Starts they won't get a keystone sending them there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Design<br />
<br />
Most dungeons should have 3-5 bosses and take around 15-20 minutes to run on the low end to 35-40 minutes on a larger and epic dungeon. Anything past that isn't great for random matchmaking content, as the likelihood that someone is going to drop out along the way increases. <br />
In raids, the bosses are the main content, with the trash there for pacing and to make it feel more like a real place.<br />
With dungeons, the team values the non-boss content as well as the bosses. <br />
In dungeons you are only spending 7-8 minutes of a 30 minute dungeon fighting the actual bosses, while spending the rest fighting the trash. There is a lot more thought that goes into the composition of the trash packs, their abilities, and mechanics. <br />
You used to quest through a zone and get sent into a dungeon to wrap up the zone. <br />
The team got away from doing that for a little while, as it increasingly felt bad when you were doing a solo quest line and then had to stop what you were doing to finish the line with a dungeon quest. <br />
With random matchmaking and LFG, it is almost still a solo experience if you want it to be. You can jump right into the dungeon and finish the storyline at the end of the zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tier Tokens<br />
<br />
There is no change to how tier set tokens work from Warlords. <br />
Personal loot gives you the set piece directly while group loot and master loot drop tokens. <br />
It feels better to loot a piece of gear rather than a token, but in a group loot situation the tokens function better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Design<br />
<br />
The team has an internal checklist when they think about encounters, similar to the role tips in the dungeon journal. <br />
Sometimes they get to the dungeon journal phase, look at creating a tip for DPS, and find that there isn't anything they can think of to write there. <br />
If that is the case, they probably need an additional mechanic. <br />
The dungeon is an entire encounter, so as a whole it should have things that are interesting and engaging for all of the different roles. <br />
<br />
<br />
Content Rewards<br />
<br />
Rather than items being a fixed power point, they are a spectrum. There is a floor on the stats and then a tapering pyramid of item level with a lower and lower chance to get that item the higher item level it is. This allows content to stay relevant for longer. <br />
Before, dungeons had a fixed place in gearing up. As soon as you moved on to any form of raiding, there was very little reason to go back and do dungeons. The team would come up with excuses to send you back so that people could enjoy dungeons, such as Badges or Valor Points, but the gear was still irrelevant. <br />
Even if you have progressed into raids in Legion, there is a chance that something cool could drop from it that will be useful for your character. <br />
It always will be best to do the hardest content available to you in terms of reward for time spent. <br />
You could still get something great from a world quest or Mythic dungeon, which is nice because that possibility didn't exist before. <br />
The person who does raid finder over the course a patch might end up with a piece of high item level gear, but it is just one piece of gear. No one is going to mistake them for a Mythic raider. For the person that got that amazing drop, that probably made their day. <br />
The team wanted to get back to a place where anything could happen rather than knowing nothing exciting would happen. <br />
<br />
<br />
Augment Runes<br />
<br />
Augment runes and the higher stat food are there for min-maxers that want to squeeze every bit of potential out of the system. <br />
There is also an economic side to this, with raiders selling BoE items from raids and using the profit to finance consumables and repairs. <br />
Augment runes allows the team to have a baseline solid reward from Raid Finder when you don't win an item. <br />
Past expansions gave you 28 gold, which didn't make anyone feel good. <br />
The augment runes can actually sell for a decent amount early on in the expansion, which is a better solution than dropping hundreds of gold and causing inflation. <br />
The intent is for augment runes to be a nice bonus to players in Raid Finder, not for Mythic raiders to feel that it is necessary to run Raid Finder.<br />
Guilds that are using augment runes generally use the guild bank to fund them or rich players in that guild. <br />
<br />
<br />
Scaling Dungeons<br />
<br />
As soon as the team starting working on the tech to scale the outdoor zones to the player level, they knew that they wanted to do it in dungeons as well. <br />
If you can do any zone while leveling it would be strange to not be able to do certain dungeons, especially when they are integrated into the zone story. <br />
This will also help with queue times, as the entire leveling pool of players can match with each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Tiers<br />
<br />
When the team released Warlords, they thought of Highmaul and Foundry as the same tier. <br />
They intended for Foundry to pick up where Highmaul left off, with early Foundry bosses tuned to expect a good amount of Highmaul gear. <br />
Even with the time between the two raids, guilds coming in were not feeling rewarded by the 10 item level increase from Highmaul to Foundry. <br />
It was common for a guild to clear normal Highmaul, do the first few bosses of Heroic Highmaul, and then go into normal Foundry, which was as hard as early Heroic Highmaul. <br />
The team hotfixed the item level of loot from Foundry to make it a full tier apart. <br />
In Legion, there is the sliding scale on item level so the team wanted to make sure that if you have been running Normal Nightmare for a while that when you go into Normal Nighthold the gear will feel like an upgrade. <br />
Going into a brand new raid, killing the first few bosses, and disenchanting everything that drops does not feel great. <br />
<br />
<br />
Legendary Items<br />
<br />
There has been some thought about a legendary item token that you could turn it, but it is premature at this stage in the system. <br />
There aren't that many legendary items yet, so you don't feel completely unable to get the one you want. <br />
If there were 20 legendary items for every spec, you might play the entire expansion and never see the one you wanted. That would feel pretty rough. <br />
If you gave players a token, there would be a specific legendary they would spend that token on and feel like a very narrow and deterministic system. <br />
The team is looking for ways to make items more interesting and exciting in a world where it feels like items are very formulaic. Legendary items can change your preferred talent build, stat ratings, or how you play your class. <br />
There is something that would be lost by giving you a token, having you pick the legendary that is best for your existing talent build, and min-max that way. <br />
Initially the team looked at having the legendary items disabled during the World First race, but you can only have one legendary item equipped, making them powerful but not overly so. <br />
There is still some tuning to be done on tank and healer legendary items, as they can have more of an impact than one DPS having one. <br />
There has always been some element of randomness in gearing up for progression. If you got Warforged Mythic Soul Capactiors on your first clear, that was a really big deal, bigger than a legendary item. <br />
There hasn't been a situation where the outcome of the World First race was decided by someone's luck while gearing up. <br />
Legendary items are tough to balance, which is why you can buy them from the NPC on beta. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wrathion<br />
<br />
Wrathion is still around. <br />
In alpha he made an appearance in Neltharion, as it is the home of his father, but the way he did it was a little confusing. <br />
One of the members of the Highmountain Tauren that had been assisting you was revealed to be Wrathion in disguise. <br />
This didn't make sense for the lore. <br />
We definitely haven't seen the last of him. <br />
<br />
<br />
Order Hall Story<br />
<br />
There are plans to continue the story of the Order Hall campaigns. The Alliance and Horde went to the Broken Shore, tried to stop the Legion, and failed miserably. <br />
A lot of the story here is you working with your Order, building up your artifact, recruiting champions, and the Orders are our hope for success against the Legion in the long run. <br />
As the story advances, Orders will be important. <br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes and Bugfixes<br />
<br />
The Exsanguinate nerf hotfix wasn't handled well. <br />
Since then, the team has tried to post about upcoming class changes a couple of days before they go live, even holding back the hotfix if messaging hasn't gone out. <br />
Players shouldn't have to worry about abilities silently changing in the middle of the raid.<br />
The team fixed a couple hundred bugs a week after the patch went live and a couple thousand a week during late beta. <br />
<br />
<br />
Class Balance and Artifacts<br />
<br />
The team draws the line at changing the relative order of specs in the short term, via hotfix. <br />
If Fire is way too good, rather than bringing them down to a point where they are tied with or worse than Frost and Arcane, they will take them to slightly too good still. <br />
You shouldn't regret what you spent your Artifact Power on. <br />
As the team looks ahead to Patch 7.1 and later in the expansion, there is more flexibility to how Artifact Power can work. <br />
They won't keep the game imbalanced for a long period of time, but in the short term there is a lot of disruption that comes from players feeling like the time they spent powering up their artifact was a mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Treasure Goblins<br />
<br />
Treasure Goblins have been removed, they might come back later. <br />
<br />
<br />
Karazhan<br />
<br />
The new Karazhan is definitely not just updating the old boss numbers. There will be some cool stuff that will blow people's minds, genuinely getting hyped!</div></div><hr />

He didn't say addons are going. He just said addons that can track your position in raids and basically hold your hand to do stuff are dying. They will then design bosses around the fact that those addons don't exist.</div></div><hr />

Wonder why Demon Hunters can get shortcuts while they said they don't want them to abuse Gliding/Jumping as an advantage. I see a ton of DH's abusing the jump in Battlegrounds already...<br />
Also what will Blizzard do about the abuse of Account Sharing during Realm-First races (both Raids and Dungeons). It seems people who openly do things against the ToS get invited to events like this. (NOT talking about Sloot here but about other Raiders/PvP players).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't speak for BGs, but in a dungeon how can you abuse it? I mean at best Druids (Wild Charge) and Rogues (Shadowstep) could follow I suppose?<br />
It could be a viable group comp for dungeons, but I can't really see it sticking tbh, and that's assuming the type of jump doesn't break LoS on the DH.</div></div><hr />

I LOL'd at that too.<br />
I'm sure watcher wants to pass the idea of us not having to fear a nerf to the spec just because the others aren't as good, but it sounds like:<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, mages will always be good no matter which spec.&quot;</div></div><hr />

How are players going to regret focusing on one spec if it performs on par with another one? If someone is the type of player to play whatever the numbers tell them to even if they aren't the biggest fan of the spec, they aren't exactly the type of player to be too concerned about what they play anyway. Previous expansions taught them versatility by now. And there shouldn't even be any damn disruptions in the first place. After eons of alpha and beta, not to mention way over a decade at developing this game by now, they should finally git gud at balancing numbers and stop delivering the same messy shit show time and time again because they are too lazy to not suck at their jobs. &quot;They won't keep the game imbalanced for a long period of time&quot;. Yeah, right. Except it's the first expansion where they actually acknowledge they may keep it imbalanced, deliberately even, and aren't just bullshitting players with dozens of excuses of how they are going to fix the problems &quot;soon&quot;/the problems fix themselves at X ilvl (that may be irrelevant for progression)/the problems don't exist. In an expansion that can't afford it thanks to Artifacts. Yeah, that should fill people with hope in regards to their competence /s</div></div><hr />

There is also an economic side to this, with raiders selling BoE items from raids and using the profit to finance consumables and repairs.<br />
Augment runes allows the team to have a baseline solid reward from Raid Finder when you don't win an item.<br />
Past expansions gave you 28 gold, which didn't make anyone feel good.<br />
The augment runes can actually sell for a decent amount early on in the expansion, which is a better solution than dropping hundreds of gold and causing inflation.<br />
The intent is for augment runes to be a nice bonus to players in Raid Finder, not for Mythic raiders to feel that it is necessary to run Raid Finder.<br />
So the intent is a system that gives consumable rewards for less serious players to then trade for gold to more serious players to make someone feel better for not getting loot. Of which is to benefit the economy from guilds who already spend a lot of gold on consumables supplied by less serious players who then buy gear and carries from said guilds. Of course raiding guilds who have the gold will not feel like they need to run LFR for a consumable when they can buy it. <br />
<br />
Seems like a needless additional consumable all to make players feel better about not getting loot.</div></div><hr />

TL;DR: What's so wrong about being proactive during a raid encounter and reacting to the boss's actions in real-time vs memorizing the raid journal and repeating dance steps? Which is more fun? Maybe they're equally fun for different people? Limiting camera distance alienates those who find it more fun being proactive.</div></div><hr />

AVR is the addon your talking about, But it is true those who don't belong in Mythic raiding think this is the end of the world. If anything it will weed out those who are getting carried. An than those who actually have good awareness during raid &amp; not relying on an addon will go on with their everyday lives. Healers I also think are over reacting about healing range.

Well that is exactly that is being broken, but the comment about &quot;Those who dont belong in Mythic&quot; is more about those who think the range indicator being removed is the end of the world &amp; they can't function with out it. When really it is a small thing that really isn't even needed if your someone with good awareness.

With addons like these, you're able to mindlessly handle mechanics. If you were able to, why wouldn't you take advantage of that? The problem is that people who complain and mention the fact that raiding is going to be harder without it is coming from those who probably don't belong in Mythic raiding guilds. I don't think any serious top raider would actually complain about the fact that the removal of this is going to make raiding harder for them. Mythic raiding is supposed to be hard, I don't think anyone should be complaining about anything in regards to difficulty unless an encounter is basically unkillable. I misunderstood the post that Kataroku made and thought he was referring to the addon, but my point still stands.</div></div><hr />

They aren't just breaking fancy lines and arrows. They are literally reverting the range checker back to the BC range checker. No radar, no dots. Just a list of names that are 10, 11, 15 or 28 yards away. There is no range 5 or range 6 anymore. it's inspect range, interact range, bandage range, type hacks. and yes those range checkers were hacks at best. Not very accurate and certainly not very customizable. Have to spread out 20 people with range 6? sorry not gonna happen anymore have to use range 10 even though it's much larger than actual requirement because range 6 requires unit positions.<br />
<br />
Do you like spam? no, well too bad. Can't check unit positions, don't know if you're on the boat, or the platform. Mogu side or mantid? top of galakras tower or on road. etc. Can't check position, filters are GONE. Can't use smart location checks to go &quot;this player only needs to know what's going on for boat&quot;. Now, timers and warnings for ALL yay!.<br />
<br />
Their fix is stupid and not well thought out. if they wanted to break arrows and stuff they could have just broke something else like detecting player facing/angle, not breaking unit position checks. This is going to have side effects that are really dumb and a huge step backwards.</div></div><hr />

How the fuck are ALLOWED addons cheats? Blizzard has ALLOWED all these things to be done, because they provide the API AddOns can use.<br />
<br />
Want to see &quot;real cheats&quot; for WoW? Go find the cinematic programs that allow you to detach the camera from your character and go fly around.

Its not the end of the world. Its quite easy to adapt to it but it will def make people worse raiders if they relayed too heavy on them and can't adapt to the new meta.<br />
<br />
FFXIV also telegraphs much better than WoW ever has; though WoW has gotten much better about this the last few years.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone is harping on people not deserving to be in Mythic if they need these addons, forgetting the fact that people who play all versions of the raid use the addons, and possibly, those who play worse than you, actually 'need' them at the normal/heroic level because they aren't as skilled as the top tier players.<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally didn't like all the fancy bubbles and stuff that was added to DBM, but the /range indicator has been in its current state for nearly a decade, seems odd they suddenly find it an issue; well, they suddenly find a lot of things issues, like camera distance as well. I think they've moved a lot of people around, and some of the people that left had some strong influence in keeping the standard we had.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good or bad, its their direction. Most will adjust. I do not have faith in their ability to design with it in mind; as they have failed at their intentions consistently. They remove mobility and promise fights won't require nearly as much ... fights come out requiring more mobility. They increase health, increase healer spell costs and lower mana pools claiming there won't be one shot mechanics, triage is important, and you'll always have time to heal the tank after big damage ... and it just never happens that way. They have ideas, but they have no clue how to implement them or they completely forget (or worse case, they are just saying things to make the pitchforks go away and have no intentions of following through).<br />
<br />
<br />
I play differently than I used to, most of this stuff will barely affect me at all; and I've played without the addons in the past rather fine; so no big deal, but can understand and relate to those who do take issue.</div></div><hr />

http://manaflask.com/articles/wod-silver-a-post-hfc-paragon-interviewI feel like your first sentence and the rest of your post are conflicting with each other. You say people need to stop saying what people have been saying in this thread, but the rest of your post only reinforces what has been said so far. Take what I said in my previous post, and replace it with: &quot;if you have to use this addon to rely on a kill, maybe that world first kill wasn't for you.&quot; Paragon did it legitimately and Method relied on a coder to provide an addon to cheese the mechanic. The kill was fair, but the fact that one guild used an addon to make a mechanic minuscule and one guild didn't on a top kill says a lot.<br />
<br />
To you and the others who have posted in response to the replies in this thread, it's perfectly okay to have an opinion and say that you don't like this change. With that being said, the point of this entire argument is that if you're complaining about this and saying that your raiding experience is ruined because of this change, you're absolutely in the wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct. Mythic raiders are not a paragon of skill and honor. They just as prone as any player to using any tool they can get their hands on to achieve their goal.<br />
<br />
Every ban wave hitting Mythic Raiders and Rated PvP player and people just blow it off like &quot;oh they're an outlier&quot;. No. The hard truth is for every bleeding-edge &lt;insert raid size&gt; there's at least one person doing things they probably shouldn't be doing.<br />
<br />
Undocumented account sharing is the biggest offense committed by players, bleeding-edge or not.</div></div><hr />

Do you like spam? no, well too bad. Can't check unit positions, don't know if you're on the boat, or the platform. Mogu side or mantid? top of galakras tower or on road. etc. Can't check position, filters are GONE. Can't use smart location checks to go &quot;this player only needs to know what's going on for boat&quot;. Now, timers and warnings for ALL yay!.<br />
<br />
Their fix is stupid and not well thought out. if they wanted to break arrows and stuff they could have just broke something else like detecting player facing/angle, not breaking unit position checks. This is going to have side effects that are really dumb and a huge step backwards.<br />

If you are running that sort of content you are smart enough to listen to your raid leader and know where you need to go/stand.<br />
<br />
These addons have been used since burning crusade (gruul), as generally people don't have a ruler in their mind (and when you have 25 players trying to get into position in a few seconds in a confined space, you do need the range check), allowing to measure the distance between 2 players. <br />

When the casual players realize &quot;Karazhan is a Mythic dungeon&quot;... Ohh boy.<br />

the game would much more better without such addons... the reason is that Developers design raids having in mind that player use x y z addons... in order to make them challenging, they need to create much more complex mechanics, ending in a not so fun fight and people having to use addons to play the game.<br />

Trying to blame me for the poor choice of words? Catapulting the raiding scene back to TBC will have an larger impact on lower skilled player than on cutting edge. <br />

He's right that Blizzard should've communicated earlier, but he puts the blame entirely on Blizzard and rants about &quot;muh my precious work and hours put into it&quot;, while he damn' well knows with games (and World of Warcraft in particular) you're never certain things will remain the same or change.<br />
His opinion in that regard is also kind of biased (since he's saying he doesn't want Blizzard to remove it but change something else) since it's his work and thus he'd be shooting himself in the foot for doing so.<br />
Nonetheless I enjoyed reading his opinion on this and his point of view is (seen from his side) correct, yet for the good of the game and the evolution of Raiding this had to happen.<br />

Designing future raid encounters with the certainty that players won't have certain addons is lot easier to manage than designing them with the assumption that most or many will be using them. While I am in favor of many quality of life addons, I have always disagreed with the notion that boss encounters should be designed with third party addons in mind when determining their difficulty and skills. XIV has been a pretty good example so far. Yes I am aware they now have some vocal addons to announce moves, but not much else and the content is more than approachable without them. I believe it will do better for the raid scene to be less about choreographed group dances using addons and more about personal responsibility with more mechanics that focus individuals.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you're referring to my post in addition to the others who have responded to this problem, it has absolutely nothing to do with people stepping foot into Mythic. I don't care who does this difficulty and kills bosses in it, the problem is that it's intended to be difficult and people are complaining about the fact that addons which trivializes the difficulty are being disabled.

&quot;The intent is for augment runes to be a nice bonus to players in Raid Finder, not for Mythic raiders to feel that it is necessary to run Raid Finder.&quot;<br />

Just come out and say you want geared players to keep queuing so the queues don't completely suck. It's why you haven't put Valor in raids. There's no other reason why you'd do that. It's an understandable goal. I wish they'd own up to it rather than give this PR-speak.</div></div><hr />

&quot;real playing&quot; is learning how to measure distance in a fanatasy-roleplaing-game with magic? And I thought real gaming was about having fun in the games you were playing...<br />

&quot;The team would come up with excuses to send you back so that people could enjoy dungeons, such as Badges or Valor Points, but the gear was still irrelevant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that sure is one way to put it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The intent is for augment runes to be a nice bonus to players in Raid Finder, not for Mythic raiders to feel that it is necessary to run Raid Finder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then you failed in your intent. A buff such as that is absolutely necessary for mythic raiders, whereas LFR players wouldn't care. If they only play LFR, then they have no need for it.<br />

Because telling the good people, that they are the only things that keep the LFR running would be an embarrassing statement to the status of LFR.<br />

<br />
Yeah, because with the help of addons you hadn't put enough effort for an encounter, seems legit. Maybe if the addon killed the boss instead of you. <br />
<br />
Archimonde mythic became trivial because of the help of the addons... Wait... Not.ű<br />
<br />
This is like about flying and camera distance. If I want to use it, why they are disallow me to use it? It's just retarded.<br />
<br />
And who say &quot;spoonfed&quot; and other bullshits can easily turn the addons off, and play the fights with extra effort.<br />
<br />
But, taking this away from good, but not TOP players, could ruin the game experience. Totally worth it.</div></div><hr />

Having those kinds of holistic skills is very valuable, it shows situational awareness and the ability to quickly assess circumstances. Far more valuable than the ability to turret out a memorized rotation while staring at your GPS. <br />

Thought I suppose the augment runes won't be what forces us to do LFR, given that loot from it will now have a random chance to be superior to mythic gear.<br />

You missed this. They're saying Runes won't force you, but the small chance of gear upgrades will.<br />

They aren't just breaking fancy lines and arrows. They are literally reverting the range checker back to the BC range checker. No radar, no dots. Just a list of names that are 10, 11, 15 or 28 yards away. There is no range 5 or range 6 anymore. it's inspect range, interact range, bandage range, type hacks. and yes those range checkers were hacks at best. Not very accurate and certainly not very customizable. Have to spread out 20 people with range 6? sorry not gonna happen anymore have to use range 10 even though it's much larger than actual requirement because range 6 requires unit positions.<br />
<br />
Do you like spam? no, well too bad. Can't check unit positions, don't know if you're on the boat, or the platform. Mogu side or mantid? top of galakras tower or on road. etc. Can't check position, filters are GONE. Can't use smart location checks to go &quot;this player only needs to know what's going on for boat&quot;. Now, timers and warnings for ALL yay!.<br />
<br />
Their fix is stupid and not well thought out. if they wanted to break arrows and stuff they could have just broke something else like detecting player facing/angle, not breaking unit position checks. This is going to have side effects that are really dumb and a huge step backwards.<br />
<br />
Absolutely this. Spot on.</div></div><hr />

Of course you can, but then you've been using these addons as a crutch for so long your skills have atrophied. Atrophied to the point that you don't even believe something like that is possible. <br />

Oh I know it's possible, but why do I need that &quot;skill&quot;? Where is the value in knowing how to do so?<br />
So I can do now, what addons made trivial years ago?<br />
That's like saying we shouldn't use robots to assemble cars, because we loose the skills to assemble cars. It's idiotic!<br />

Yea, I get their end of it though. If it's a token and you get the specific one you want then you stop doing things that net that token. Less time you spend playing then eventually get the complaints. My issue is more of the fact that there's SO many legendaries already and they're going to add more from the sound of it. It would be one thing if say each spec had two that altered stat weights/gameplay/builds. But each spec has numerous ones plus the non spec related ones like the boots that increase move speed by haste. it's a flawed system yes, but it's still better than picking what you want. The bigger problem is the effect these will have on performance in a raid setting. I don't think they should be usable until halfway through a tier in Mythic raiding at the earliest.</div></div><hr />

The game would be much better if raiding addons were as sanitized as in FFXIV - yes they have parsers there, but it provides recount and TellMeWhen'esque functionality at most.<br />
<br />
ACT that people use for FF14 can be customized to give pretty much the same callouts as DBM did a few expansions back. FF14 bosses work on a very strict x ability happens every y seconds so its very easy to set up ACT to give you callouts when boss attacks are about to happen, why you get a certain buff/debuff. Its not as advanced as DBM but it can be set up for similar functionality, and yes the top guilds Elysium etc have it set it up for callouts you can hear in their clear vids. <br />
<br />
Theres the Overleylines ECHO project which actually tells you what to do in the fight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCQMSlnd_jU<br />
<br />
You also have to remember FF14s boss mechanics are about as complex than dungeon boss mechanics in WoW, they are just far more punishing.</div></div><hr />

It is kinda of true, I have played without add-ons since 2004 except for like mogit which gives you no benefit outside of telling you if you have an appearance or not. I have even been top DPS and heals raiding in the past before heroics were introduced with no add-ons when shit was considered &quot;Harder&quot; lol, like WoW was ever hard, it is like anything sequential, you practice and rinse and repeat and get amazing at it, it is a repetition based game.</div></div><hr />

Ahem no...That`s not a game then, that`s a competition. &quot;Game: a physical or mental activity or contest that has rules and that people do for pleasure&quot;<br />

I'd argue that the Olympics is a series of games done competitively, so is raiding/high level pvp. On a different scale, but games can definitely be competitive. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hey look there is more than one definition of game.<br />
<br />
game ɡām/<br />
noun<br />
<br />
1 - a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck.<br />
<br />
2 - a physical or mental competition conducted according to rules with the participants in direct opposition to each other<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets go to the olympics website. https://www.olympic.org<br />

Then what the hell would you call ESports? Which is literally playing a VIDEO GAME in a competitive space to prove your mastery. Also, are you really that arrogant to be trying to dictate just who gets pleasure out of which activity?</div></div><hr />

Of course there's pure luck involved with a game that uses RNG. Blizzard piled on RNG because players kept creating addons to trivialize fights. Addons can't trivialize RNG, only overgearing or using exploits can.<br />
<br />
L2P argument works perfectly fine when a player is given the chance to experience the content, fail, and try again.<br />
<br />
Any case were the L2P argument doesn't work is because players are forcing other players to know mechanics they've never personally experienced and not give them a chance to fail (aka elitists).<br />
<br />
Mythic Archi would be completely possible without radar. Nobody cares about what world-first raiders do (except Blizzard if they need to fix a bug/exploit). Addons force players to adjust their methods according to the availability of addons, rather than just doing the boss mechanics. They look to cheese instead of appease.<br />
<br />
It's completely embarrassing to watch another player just willfully ignore mechanics. People forget, but to see someone straight-out ignore mechanics and then bitch something happens infuriates me.<br />
<br />
The only addons I've ever used:<br />
<br />
-Omen (in BC a raid leader forced me to, but knowing how much TPS my tank could do was important) -- No longer important since game has threat meter now.<br />
-Recount/Skada/TinyDPS (because there's no way, short of Health/Time=DPS or battleground score board, to gauge your dps)<br />
-TomTom (only for MoP, and deleted after, for the stupid lore scrolls that even the devs admit was stupid) -- Will be broken in 7.1 anyway.<br />

You undermined your own argument in the same post. If they added RNG because addons trivialized fights, then removing aforementioned addons while keeping the same level of RNG and positional difficulty will make it overtuned and unnecessarily annoying.<br />
<br />
Also, please stop saying &quot;Git gud&quot;. You only out yourself as the same kind of elitist you were talking about in your post. Or are you going to tell Method, Exordus and all the other top guilds that use these addons to git gud as well? Honestly :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

WOW is not an elit game, it is not about winning the charts or topping some leage ladder, it is about the social, fun, raiding, dungeon part of the game, if you spend all your time thinking of the mythic + people then your missing out of more than 9/10 of the people thats left. It is insane with all this mythic+ stuff, start worrying more and about the regular playeryou have mythic dungeons for non-raiders who want to have something to do with a higher difficulty, as well as LFR, Nomal, and Heroic raids for those who aren't able to handle Mythic. I don't get what your point is, there are plenty of things to do for the &quot;regular player.&quot;</div></div><hr />

RIP addons. The game is getting less and less customizable. Like I said this Legion will be worse than WoD was.<br />

When the casual players realize &quot;Karazhan is a Mythic dungeon&quot;... Ohh boy.<br />
<br />
Casual players run mythics now, what's stopping them from doing it in Legion?<br />
<br />
Also, saying rip addons is a touch of hyperbole, no? They're killing the functionality of a very small subset of addons that are too powerful in Blizzard's opinion. The vast majority of addons will still function. If you listen to the interview instead of just freaking out about the one line MMO Champion write, you'll realise the focus of what Ion is talking about. It's entirely instance content specific, for one thing. Anything out in the world is untouched by this.</div></div><hr />

That might be because bosses that fit on the screen at a normal zoom distance are exceedingly rare in WoW.<br />
Most of the time you are lucky if oyu see one foot and a lot of sparcles. <br />

If they do not want radar addons then they should work on providing the thing that allows us awareness of what is around us in the real world: Auditory Clues.<br />

They don't really need to say anything though. What other company justifies changes any more than what they've told us or gives away it's long term strategy for a subscriber model? Blizzard gives out far more information than practically any other gaming company world wide and frankly, post 7.1 this change won't even enter players minds.<br />
<br />
Practically all PvP players who take arena seriously do so without addons as its part of tournament rules. In PvE, other than some boss mod it is possible to play this game to a high standard with the default UI, you just make it harder for yourself. Most addons are designed in someway to make things easier, that is the whole ethos of the addon system.</div></div><hr />

Fair point, but macros don't exist in a lot of other MMOs. And while re-binding keys is available in most games, it's still not something that is required to play this game.<br />
My point is, that if you want to be effective in this game (or any other), you do these steps. First you re-bind your keys. Then WoW gives you the option of macros and on top of that you can use addons. And beyond a level it's not optional for the 99%, but mandatory. Because numbers are tweaked with the expectations, that you have everythign bound, macro'd and an addon is giving you &quot;recommendations&quot; on what to press next. Encounter mechanics expect of you to see the timers on abilities, get proximity and position warning, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No class or spec requires macros to function, or even to perform optimally. In fact, many of them don't even see real benefit from using macros. Almost the entirety of the macros I have coded are there for convenience. The only real game-changers in combat are my mouseover healing and buff macros, and my focus-target macros for certain critical abilities (like interrupts). No real point in macroing beyond that. Castsequence macros are always a DPS loss.<br />
<br />
Also, the specs are actually balanced around the assumption that you aren't using a rotation suggestion addon, because almost without fail you'll do more DPS by learning the rotation properly instead of blindly hitting whatever the addon says to hit. This is mostly because those addons have no look-ahead, nor can they account for boss mechanics and upcoming boss events. Literally no one at the top end of raiding (or PvP) uses those rotational suggestion addons, they exist purely for those that can't be arsed to learn their rotation.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elofyn</div><div class="date">2016-08-22, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the topic of breaking addons, I think it's a positive change. I used to raid in Swtor and my personal opinion is that the raid mechanics in most difficult raid tears were considerably harder than HFC mythic. Then, on the other hand, Swtor did not allow any kind of addons. So the players had to know their own shit and the mechanics without a minimap popping up telling then how close they are from each other or where to stand exactly. <br />
<br />
So while distance tools and location guiding systems are surely handy, it feels more rewarding to kill that boss without an a tool doing half the work. Just my cents tho!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to see where Blizzard said they create and tweak the raid bosses on the assumption that players are being fed their rotation. And if players need to be feed their rotations, I'm not sure they are that good, so I don't know that I'd tweak a raid boss based around that. I didn't get that from What Ion said. If they are assuming that Players are beign fed everything via a add-on, why do boss still do their emotes?<br />
<br />
On the actual topic. I think it's really great that they are cutting out the mods like AVR (never used radar). As Ion stated they didn't want to break mods like Gatherer, which is overall harmless in what it does. Once they determined they could break the raid mods without the world mods, they announced it.</div></div><hr />

If the fights become so trivial with the addons, how come less than 500 guilds were able to kill Mannoroth and Archimonde before ilvl upgrades became available? Truth is, even with these addons, the fights on mythic are so complex and unforgiving that even if you have all the information available (like how far you have to run before you won't get 1shot, or how far you have to move so you won't chain that 6 yd chain spell, while still being able to melee boss), there is still plenty of space for personal errors that can (and will) lead to wipe eventually.</div></div><hr />

Should be entirely removed from the game. They're so lax over at blizzard it's not even fun any more. It should be 100% player skill to know every single part of the encounter and nail it down perfectly every time, not some addon telling you timers and crap. It has always annoyed me and just brings casual trash into mmos where they don't belong. I remember when mmos used to be hard and actually challenging.

They aren't just breaking fancy lines and arrows. They are literally reverting the range checker back to the BC range checker. No radar, no dots. Just a list of names that are 10, 11, 15 or 28 yards away. There is no range 5 or range 6 anymore. it's inspect range, interact range, bandage range, type hacks. and yes those range checkers were hacks at best. Not very accurate and certainly not very customizable. Have to spread out 20 people with range 6? sorry not gonna happen anymore have to use range 10 even though it's much larger than actual requirement because range 6 requires unit positions.<br />
<br />
Do you like spam? no, well too bad. Can't check unit positions, don't know if you're on the boat, or the platform. Mogu side or mantid? top of galakras tower or on road. etc. Can't check position, filters are GONE. Can't use smart location checks to go &quot;this player only needs to know what's going on for boat&quot;. Now, timers and warnings for ALL yay!.<br />
<br />
Their fix is stupid and not well thought out. if they wanted to break arrows and stuff they could have just broke something else like detecting player facing/angle, not breaking unit position checks. This is going to have side effects that are really dumb and a huge step backwards.<br />

ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!!!! chooo chooo!<br />
<br />
Call me crazy, or maybe I was tired when I heard it on the stream, but I am quite sure Ion said &quot;JAINAuinly getting hyped&quot;<br />
<br />
As in hinting something about Jaina Proudmoore.<br />
<br />
Hmmm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does the zoom which you have to activate outside the slider come with patch 7.1 or is it already in the game?lol? pretty sure they never addressed the issue until the inteview</div></div><hr />

<br />
This kills every mod that can tell where any thing is positioned. The way to look at it is addons are now blind to where anything is positioned in the world for dungeons and raids.<br />

<br />
<br />
the camera zoom explanations were basically all garbage<br />
<br />
Come on man, they were perfectly fine. THE DETAILS ON THE STAIRS, MAN. If the step is chest high to compensate, it destroys the entire world. WoW comes to an end with chest high steps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, it's screwed. Basically we're going back to the TBC range checking system where there are built small set of ranges you're allowed to check for. Like 27 yards, 16 yards, 8, 3, etc. The range of things like Inspecting and Bandages. Your addons can now only check those ranges, they can't get exact range. So now say for instance you want to check if a player is 30 yards away for a 30 yard range spell.<br />
<br />
No bueno, you can only check if they are 27 yards, so you'll either not get a range check at all, or the creator will decide to say &quot;Sure, he's within 30 yards&quot; if he's within 27 so you're actually up to 3 yards closer than you need to be by the time the bar highlights. This could cause unexpected deaths because a dying player could be 29 yards away, within range, but you think he's out of range because the addon says he's too far away since he's past the 27 yards it can check for.<br />
<br />
Have fun when a boss requires everyone to spread out 10 yards from each other but your addon can only know if someone is within 7 yards and can't display position so you just get a text list of people within 7 yards. You then have to read their name, look at your screen and see where they are standing and move until they drop out of your range list (all within the few seconds before the boss does his spell), turns out they're only 8 yards away now (just past the range check distance of 7 yards) but that's still too close for the boss mechanic, boom you're dead.<br />
<br />
If you raided Gruul in TBC you'll remember this little bastard of a range checker that hardly helped at all.<br />

Well he's back, because they've essentially just rolled back addon unitPosition logic 10 years and put us back in TBC.<br />
<br />
Also don't drink their koolaid on how they can now design fights around not needing them. Legion raids are full to the brim of these mechanics that beg for radar HUDs. In fact most feedback threads during beta test raid weekends were people asking for addon updates because it's way too much to keep track of without.<br />
<br />
If they really cared about drawing arrows and whatever they would have broken the GetPlayerFacing command which would have made drawing arrows to positions and knowing exactly where a unit was impossible but left alone the ability to check exact range from a target.</div></div><hr />

You say fanboy but here you are joining the bandwagon. Ironic<br />
<br />
I'd hardly call it removing customization when every single raiding guild that has any idea what they're doing will require all raiders to have those add-ons. And removing add-ons that make certain mechanics trivial is hardly what I would call &quot;dumbing things down&quot;<br />
<br />
OT: I really wish they would just revert the camera back to the way it used to be. They keep changing their position on it and it almost seems like they don't know what their goal is anymore.</div></div><hr />

Addons give the game depth. If they remove all addons it dumbs the game down to a simpler state. Something an idiot could handle who is a new player getting overwhelmed by zoom macros and robust character stats.</div></div><hr />

Where are you getting information on which APIs are changing? I saw MysticalOS also posted regarding this but I thought these changes were not on PTR yet? If you have datamined the API changes please provide a link, thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
//reading comprehension//<br />
<br />
No it wont, if you already do mythic then once the gear race is over you wont give a flying f about lfr titanforge chance, maybe one or two will but not a majority. I really cannot see that happening. What I can see happening is that if you're a serious raider you will want to do LFR or AH your way to runes until they implement a permanent reputation based one. As Ion said in some interview, and I paraphrase, 'you might see one or two lfr raiders with a mythic ilvl piece, but it wont ever be like those who actually raid mythic and are fully decked' thus if you are fully decked, which does not take very long time (not bis, just decked) you wont have any reason to go into lfr, unless you want a derp % chance to maybe get that odd trinket?! <br />
<br />
The best compromise I could do with your statement would be serious raiders doing LFR for runes, with a off chance of getting a new piece of loot, but never as the main reason. <br />
<br />
Regarding my reading comprehension, aren't we all talking out of our asses here? It seems more like you're annoyed I'm not agreeing with you.</div></div><hr />

No they wont. they will have to deal with all the sh!t players out there -.-</div></div><hr />

I look forward to what my new PR lvl 7 mythic reward chest item will be, its an item 5ilvl higher than the one I got in heroic EN yesterday.<br />
I look forward to world boss drop. Finally get loot - stats suck but its an ilvl upgrade. Add to bottom of bag to inflate my ilvl.</div></div><hr />
