Valve and Blizzard Reach DotA Trademark Agreement<br />
Some time ago (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2645-MoP-Talent-Calculator-Blizzard-vs-Valve-LoLPro-Blue-Posts-The-Daily-Blink) we mentioned the ongoing battle between Blizzard and Valve over the DotA trademark. This was finally resolved recently with an agreement that allows Valve to use the DotA trademark commercially and Blizzard to use the trademark only for noncommercial use. This means that they could no longer use the name Blizzard DotA and have now renamed the game to Blizzard All-Stars. <br />
<br />
In a press release, Rob Pardo said that the new name &quot;better reflects the design of our game&quot; and that Blizzard will go into more detail on that in the future. Gabe Newell expressed his pleasure at coming to an agreement without making things messy, saying that &quot;We both want to focus on the things our fans care about, creating and shipping great games for our communities.&quot;<br />
<br />
The companies do not plan to discuss the terms of the agreement beyond today's announcement, but we now know that the DotA name will still be safe for the community to use! Riot has not officially commented on this agreement and the status of their dispute remains unchanged (http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=85102245&amp;pty=EXT) on the USPTO website.<br />

Quest Rewards Lack Spirit<br />
Note that I have about 10K spellpower and a little over 7K mana regen. When I think about it, 10K spellpower is what I had in epic 85 gear with about 6K mana regen. Taking into account the huge mana pool increase at 89 (250K versus my ~132K live at 85), this is quite troubling.<br />
I'm looking at the Townlong quest rewards, just because that's what I happen to have in front of me, and it looks like you would get about 1800 Spirit from the ilevel 429 gear in that zone. How much Spirit do you have at the moment?<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if part of what is going on is that mana pool and spell costs jump instantly when you level, but regen requires you to gear back up to that level. It's the same phenomenon that happens with say crit or haste but it may feel worse with Spirit.<br />
<br />
Like Tiriel, I cringe when I queue for Mogo'shan. I'm thinking that place is overtuned versus the gear we have. I can only cover so many player mistakes. (Yeah, I know. They need to get out of the fire and all that.)<br />
Entirely possible. We ran it the other day, and the final boss did way too much damage from traps. The mechanics have changed a little bit because of that, and of course it's hard for me to remember which version of the dungeon you have without just jumping into beta myself and doing the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Again, level up dungeons have to be easy because of the simple fact that if you die much at all, you're just going to run the quests instead, given that even the best rewards from a level up dungeon won't last more than a few hours. If dungeons are inefficient, players will just skip them. At max level it's a different story obviously.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what it should be balanced around, healing in that gear when you have crap regen with crap quest gear. So you should be able to heal brewery in 333 gear that you get in Twilight Highlands because that's the previous step right? Without basically any enchants and anything really going for you. If that's the case, which it is, obviously the dungeons are going to have to take a small step down in their difficulty scale.<br />
Exactly. If you can't heal those dungeons yet, then there is a problem on our end. Some of you are acting like the system is fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed. It can be, fairly easily.<br />
<br />
It would be helpful to hear a few numbers from you guys, such as character level, average ilevel and current Spirit. It doesn't need to be super precise.<br />
<br />
This is a very good question. Having to swap specs every time you turn in a quest to game your rewards would be very cumbersome. <br />
1) You shouldn't need a lot of Spirit to heal a level up dungeon. A Ret paladin with a lot of Strength gear who swaps Holy should still be a tolerable healer.<br />
<br />
2) There are several redundant quest rewards. If you already have the shoulders for your primary spec, take the ones for your off-spec. This is particularly true of Four Winds - Krasarang which are the same level, and Townlong - Dread Wastes, which are the same level.<br />
<br />
3) We offer choices in gear (say healer vs. nuker) for many quests, typically end-cappers, blue rewards, weapons and trinkets. In the final zones, there are even more of those since we figure players who level as DPS may start thinking about their end-game healer or tanking gear at that time.<br />
<br />
4) If all else fails, there are vendors scattered about with decent green gear. If you have been leveling as Enhance and want to try Resto, you can get a good enough head start by hitting the vendors. Again, the leveling up content where you would want to heal should not feel dangerous at all, especially once you've seen the bosses once.<br />
<br />
Nobody is arguing that healers need a lot of Spirit to function. It is our intention that you want a lot of Spirit and can get a lot of Spirit. You should not need Spirit in every slot.<br />
<br />
Feedback is very mixed in this thread, so trying to distill it down to one of the following would be more useful than more posts of &quot;I need Spirit,&quot; which doesn't give us much information. What we are trying to ascertain is which of the following is true:<br />
<br />
1) You have Spirit on nearly every piece and still can't function.<br />
2) You want more Spirit but can't find any.<br />
3) You don't have Spirit on every piece, so you want more.<br />
4) You want so much Spirit that you never run OOM.<br />
<br />
Points 1 and 2 are of the most concern to us, but it's still important to distinguish which problem is occurring. Is the problem acquiring Spirit, or is the problem that even with Spirit on many pieces, you run out of mana too frequently?<br />
<br />
In this case, it's probably also more relevant how many heals you can cast before running out of mana just standing around alone somewhere, because when healing a dungeon, we can't easily extract from your feedback alone whether the encounters cause too much damage or whether the damage is appropriate and it's the HPS or longevity that are low.<br />
<br />
After reading more of this feedback and looking at the zones, we're concerned that there aren't enough quest rewards with Spirit on them. We are leaning towards offering more, as choices, so that players who feel like their Spirit is low can choose to have more.

Once there is more information about how this all works, we'll provide more insight into it.<br />
<br />
When we can share more about what we're going for and how it will all work, we will. It's not a deeply shrouded mystery, and you get the general gist, but as it's still in testing to begin with, it's hard to go into details about something that we don't have details for aside from what we think we want to try out. (And we don't plan to share that currently. We prefer to test and see first. ) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222772-the-black-market-ah-only-caters-to-the-1/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4927284051?page=5#96))<br />
<br />
Infuriated by the Black Market<br />
It's worth noting that since we're in beta, we're still looking into what our philosophies are for what should and what shouldn't be on the Black Market. We're also trying to discern the frequency/rarity of what shows up there as well. <br />
<br />
Again, I want to reinforce that we are in beta and the most helpful sorts of discussions everyone can have is simply in sharing constructive feedback about what you're experiencing with the new features and what you'd like to see or not see. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222767-infuriated-by-the-black-market/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4927283213?page=23#443))<br />
<br />
Male Pandaren Dance Changed?<br />
We're looking into this. Most likely there was some erroneous data pushed. It's being investigated however. When we do another beta push, this should be corrected again. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222731-woah-give-us-back-the-male-panda-shuffle/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4926593214?page=10#194))<br />
<br />
Inactive Guild Master Replacement<br />
The idea of this feature is that in many cases, a guild leader will leave for a time and there's no contingency for someone else to be able to handle the guild if that guild leader chooses not to return (or whatever other issues may occur). Many guild members who experienced missing guild leaders made it clear that they wanted a means by which they could gain control of a guild if the guild leader went missing or was gone for a long while. <br />
<br />
We've adjusted the length of time until this occurs as well as changed the eligibility for this to get passed along both. You can see the details in the following post: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4488479071<br />
<br />
If you're on vacation for a few months, the update gives you 90 days now instead of the original 30 days. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222786-inactive-guild-master-replacement-really/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4927283703?page=2#26))<br />

We're aware that some Australian GAME customers have been left out in the cold on what should be the hottest night of the year -- the launch of Diablo III. To help with this situation and get these players into the game as soon as possible, we've put the following process in place.<br />
<br />
Australian GAME customers with a valid preorder/prepurchase receipt dated before May 15, 2012 can do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Purchase the digital version of Diablo III from http://www.diablo3.com now or anytime before May 21, 2012.<br />
<br />
2. Download and start playing when the servers go live!<br />
<br />
3. Submit your GAME Australia preorder/prepurchase receipt to us before June 30, 2012.<br />
<br />
4. Receive a credit from Blizzard, for the amount you paid in advance to GAME Australia for Diablo III. This credit will be applied to the payment method used for the digital purchase.<br />
<br />
We'll post further details here on how to submit your GAME Australia receipt to our customer service team as soon as possible. Stay tuned, and we look forward to seeing you in the Burning Hells!<br />

Well now you do. Ok, I don't hate it. But it is boring as all heck, and the quest flow is kind of outdated, having to crisscross the zone multiple times for every hub for no discernible reason other than to add travel time - all on a slower mount. Northrend tends to be a bit better organized with more localized quests, while still retaining Outland's choice in where you want to quest/level. (I'd take 'Skip Cataclysm' in a heartbeat though. Way too linear, and too few zones).<br />

I hear ya, but if I was going to choose someplace to skip it would be Northrend. Not that I didn't love Northrend the first time through, it's just that it takes forever. Whenever I level an alt, I always seem to just stop in Northrend. I think the Outland quests were fine, there are usually several close together and now with a flying mount they are so easy to drop right down on top of quest mobs without having to deal with trash at all. Also because you get so much experience you can pretty much leave a zone 1/3 of the way through.</div></div><hr />

Sure everyone that has it got lucky, but that doesn't mean they didn't try a kajillion times before getting lucky. But even getting it on your first try is considerably more effort than plopping down a chunk of gold.</div></div><hr />

Is it really, though? Unless you made a few shady deals with Susan, the large amount of gold that will be required for the black market auction house won't exactly fall from trees.

<br />
Fair enough, but the kind of effort is different. The rich players use addons to scan the auction house, snipe short time auctions, monopolize certain items etc... So I guess it could be seen as a reward for the AH players. But it does take away from the players who do content to get what were previously thought of as unique and prestigious items, and give the reward to players who put in the most time playing AH.</div></div><hr />

Wrong... omg so wrong. The #1 problem with the game currently is that level up content doesn't teach players how to play their class+spec. You can't just dump them into end game content like you currently do with them knowing absolutely nothing except spam aoe and loot.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard already gave the reason why this wouldn't work, but you conveniently left that out of your quote: If level-up dungeons are too hard (resulting in wipes), people will just stop queuing for them and level up to 90 by doing quests. That gives them even less experience in playing their class in a dungeon/raid environment.<br />
<br />
The training you'd like to see happen, has to happen in regular 90 dungeons: People will have to run those for gear, in order to queue for heroics. You can't just skip them, so that's the point where people should be taught to play and get ready for heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This whole Black Market AH seems like a gift to gold sellers. The only way it would not be so overt is when I fully expect it to have a real cash component sometime within a year of its introduction. <br />
<br />
The issue that Blizzard does not understand; then again they just might; they are introducing more must haves. Just like when people repeat over and over that &quot;You don't need 280 or 310 flight speed&quot;. Yes you do. Or at least that is the mindset of many players. People don't want to feel as if they are second class citizens so if something is made relatively obtainable then that makes it essentially required. I know people in guild who buy gold almost every month; heck I know some who sell it too. I have played with people who pay real money for gear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobleshield</div><div class="date">2012-05-15, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the dungeon thing, I think leveling dungeons shouldn't be TOO hard, but they shouldn't be faceroll easy with zero mechanics like they are now. This is why I like how Rift made the dungeons - dungeons (even the expert/heroic ones, but especially the leveling ones) have easy, aoe-able trash and bosses with mechanics that you can't ignore except in certain rare circumstances (and depending on group comp). Basically, you WILL fail if you just stand there and DPS a boss, like you should. The mechanics are usually nothing too difficult (don't stand in fire, don't stand near anyone when you get Debuff X, don't hit boss when he has reflection shield up, run from boss when he does big channeled AOE) but are tuned so that if you ignore them, you'll die.<br />
<br />
Compare that to WoW, where pretty much currently everything outside of a handful of dungeons you can totally ignore mechanics and just stand there and DPS and win. That teaches nobody anything other than how to faceroll content, and yet it's a wonder when these players perform the same way in LFR, heroics and raids? They've never been taught &quot;watch for things on the ground&quot; or &quot;kill this add because it reduces the boss' damage taken&quot; while doing dungeons.<br />
<br />
For example, in Rift the first dungeon is Realm of the Fae (approx. level 15-17ish dungeon). It has four bosses:<br />
<br />
Trickster Maelow: Has two fairies that shield him and need to be killed first. Sometimes polymorphs a player.<br />
Luggodhan: Tosses purple slime on the ground<br />
Battlemaster Atrophinius: Has two adds that might need to be killed; charges random players for big damage<br />
Fae Lord Twyl: Has four phases (first three are just adds). Fourth phase has a moving damaging AOE effect you have to watch for, and he sometimes freezes you in place.<br />
<br />
In addition pretty much every boss in the game has a frontal cleave so DPS have to learn to be behind the boss (and some have front and rear cleaves a la WoW dragons)<br />
<br />
Compare that to Ragefire Chasm (I forget names here):<br />
<br />
Trogg: Does nothing, glorified trash mob<br />
Orc Warlock: Does nothing (just spams Shadowbolt?), glorified trash mob<br />
Felguard: Does nothing, glorified trash mob<br />
Satyr: Does nothing (maybe a poison DoT?). Glorified trash mob.<br />
<br />
No boss has any sort of mechanic, even a minor one for totally new players to at least be exposed to the concept of dungeon bosses being more than &quot;stand there and DPS&quot; or &quot;stand there and toss heals&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Agree. And then raids often have way too many mechanics. I for one enjoyed MC more. Just a few things to watch out for during bosses, and not 40 like these days. It's not a problem for me, but many others fail at these and also the learning curve would be less steep. No one likes wiping.</div></div><hr />

That gives them even less experience in playing their class in a dungeon/raid environment.<br />
<br />
The training you'd like to see happen, has to happen in regular 90 dungeons: People will have to run those for gear, in order to queue for heroics. You can't just skip them, so that's the point where people should be taught to play and get ready for heroics.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean they need to be faceroll easy though, it just means they shouldn't be heroic hard. They NEED to be challenging or fail players will just stay fail players. And that goes for dungeons from level 1-85 as well. They are way too easy, and teach players nothing about playing their character.</div></div><hr />

It is not the adversity that makes you a better player but how you respond to it. Since it is only a game, only your personal pride can make you strive to be a better player. Some people are willing to put in 300+ wipes on Rag heroic prenerf, while many don't. Think about it, what makes you level raiding professions to 525, get perfect gems into your gear, get everything enchanted, get therazane enchant (assuming no inscription), get appropriate head enchant, install a gazillion addons, buy flask and potions to prepot and raid, and most important of all - put in countless hours to improve yourself? How many people do you see pulling in 12k in cata gear in LFR(Non dps excluded)<br />
<br />
I don't support extra difficult dungeons because a)It will lead to exodus of players a la early cata heroics b)there is some content that should be accessible to anyone (I am opposed to lfr tho)</div></div><hr />

Bads don't even think about any of that though... they just want everything handed to them :(<br />
<br />
So there's 2 options, make the game so ridiculously easy that the bads can clear everything and get all the gear and mounts and titles etc... or stop catering to them and start helping them to be better players so they can actually earn things.</div></div><hr />

This whole Black Market AH seems like a gift to gold sellers. The only way it would not be so overt is when I fully expect it to have a real cash component sometime within a year of its introduction. <br />
<br />
SNIP ....<br />
<br />
Just watch. If the RMAH is a success in D3, you can expect to see it in WOW in some fashion before the years end and the people that once hated the cash out option will not only eat it up in D3, they will fall for it in WOW just the same.</div></div><hr />

The rich players use addons to scan the auction house, snipe short time auctions, monopolize certain items etc... So I guess it could be seen as a reward for the AH players. But it does take away from the players who do content to get what were previously thought of as unique and prestigious items, and give the reward to players who put in the most time playing AH.<br />
<br />
People use addons in raids too, and when TK was challenging content, addons were a necessity then too. I don't understand this line of thought at all. In most cases, if you don't need addons, whatever you're doing is easy. In other words, by bringing up addons, you're saying that making money on the AH is more difficult than farming the mount nowadays.<br />
<br />
Having an item show up on the BMAH from time to time and costing an exorbitant amount of gold to win, won't make it any less prestigious than people two-manning/soloing old content for it already does.</div></div><hr />

Removing the choice won't reduce people showing up with fail gear at 90 for the heroic or raid... It just makes it harder for those who do know they're doing to do it right.<br />

1) You shouldn't need a lot of Spirit to heal a level up dungeon. A Ret paladin with a lot of Strength gear who swaps Holy should still be a tolerable healer.<br />
<br />
2) There are several redundant quest rewards. If you already have the shoulders for your primary spec, take the ones for your off-spec. This is particularly true of Four Winds - Krasarang which are the same level, and Townlong - Dread Wastes, which are the same level.<br />
<br />
3) We offer choices in gear (say healer vs. nuker) for many quests, typically end-cappers, blue rewards, weapons and trinkets. In the final zones, there are even more of those since we figure players who level as DPS may start thinking about their end-game healer or tanking gear at that time.<br />
<br />
4) If all else fails, there are vendors scattered about with decent green gear. If you have been leveling as Enhance and want to try Resto, you can get a good enough head start by hitting the vendors. Again, the leveling up content where you would want to heal should not feel dangerous at all, especially once you've seen the bosses once.<br />
<br />
Why? Just...why? I do not want to do quests as resto or heal as a dps spec. I do not want to switch specs every time I turn in a quest to see different rewards. Give me choices and let me choose.<br />
<br />
At least let it be an option to turn off, like the beginner tutorials and tooltips.</div></div><hr />

The #1 problem with the game currently is that level up content doesn't teach players how to play their class+spec. You can't just dump them into end game content like you currently do with them knowing absolutely nothing except spam aoe and loot.<br />
<br />
Thank you Blizzard for being smarter than this guy. did you read the rest of GCs answer.. He is completely accurate. If leveling up dungeons are difficult and require multiple death runs.. people just won´t use them. So your master ´plan´for educating players would just be skipped by the majority of players anyway.. and certainly the ones you seem to want to educate.<br />
<br />
Face it.. the entry level heroics are the ´learning curve´ that you speak of. Or in a better case. the level 90 normal modes.. but people tend to find ways to skip them.<br />

Disagree, the feedback has been very mixed. Especially coming form people who often miss out of quest rewards for having an ábnormal´ spec like moonkin. ¨Here, this is the final quest in a long chain and is the final quest of the highest leveling zone¨ Your reward choices are this item that vendors for 25g or this item that vendor for 23g.<br />
<br />
Did you even read what he wrote? Leveling dungeons do not require you to be geared perfectly, and the last zones DO OFFER you a choice. He specifically said a Holy Pally in STR gear will be able to heal level up dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Not likely gone in a few seconds on bid only auctions (no buyout). min. 12 hour.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
If an ashes or other rare mount shows up and it's a bid war between players, it's going to sell for hundreds of thousands of gold (if not more). It's not like all of the sudden these rare mounts are going to be any less rare. It's not like everyone and their mom is going to be riding around on these super rare mounts. If someone wants to pay 500k for a mount, that's their business. <br />
