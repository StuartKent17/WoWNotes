<br />
Note about the Celestial Steed - A few people reported that on the official site, Algalon is the last boss of the Vault of Archavon (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/dungeons/wrath/vault-of-archavon.xml) and assume that he will be available in this instance in a later patch. I would say that this is very unlikely, the official dungeons pages are greatly outdated (Ulduar is still shown as an &quot;unknown&quot; raid instance without any information) and this is most likely a very old error.<br />
<br />
Update - Updated the PTR Build info.<br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.3 - PTR Build 11623<br />
A new build has been deployed on test realms, a couple of things have changed! As usual, these changes are from client data comparison and shouldn't be considered as final until they hit the official patch notes. Make sure you check the latest Patch 3.3.3 Notes Update (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/world-first-glory-of-the-icecrown-raider-(25)-3-3-3-notes-update/).<br />

<br />
The Celestial Dragon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75613/celestial-dragon/) had its model updated with a couple of new effects and looks very nice as well.<br />

<br />
Last but not least, the multi-passenger rocket mount discovered in an earlier build now has 2 spells, it's not very clear if players will be able to use this mount all the time or just during some kind of event but the strange spell is probably just required to &quot;mount&quot; as a passenger.<br />
<br />
X-53 Touring Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75953/) - Mounts the target, limited to the outdoors, following normal vehicle rules. <br />
X-53 Touring Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75957/) - Summons an X-53 Touring Rocket. This mount's speed depends upon your riding skill. <br />

Lich King (10) Heroic World First Kill by Paragon<br />
The Lich King finally died in Heroic Mode! Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/) finally defeated him in 10-man mode (the 5% Hellscream's Warsong (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73816/hellscreams-warsong/) was used for the kill). Congratulations to them! <br />
<br />
From Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/)<br />
We have now killed The Lich King on hard mode in 10-man Icecrown Citadel. Good job everyone who were on the kill and those who participated on the endless strategy discussion. <br />
<br />
This encounter had a bug on the spirit phase which we reported 2 weeks ago but it didn't get fixed untill today (the bug made the encounter very hard). We had worked our way around the spirit problem on last week's reset and the kill was within our grasp even without any extra attempts or buffs. <br />
<br />
A video will be released on a later date (tm).<br />

<br />
Interesting note on LK being buggy, they imply it is the bug that kept them from killing him. Still a long way from a 25man kill though (considering they probably overgeared the 10man heroic encounter in a mix of 264/277 gear by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I dont think Ensidia is in the &quot;race for the 10 man heroic&quot; since Tarren Mill has been crashing every evening at 20.00 server time (raid time) for the last 7-8 days.<br />
<br />
But I dont know, perhaps they play during the days when the realm is online.</div></div><hr />

This encounter had a bug on the spirit phase which we reported 2 weeks ago but it didn't get fixed untill today (the bug made the encounter very hard). We had worked our way around the spirit problem on last week's reset and the kill was within our grasp even without any extra attempts or buffs. <br />
<br />
At the risk of sounding like a troll or nut-hugger, I'd really like to be able to go back to when Ensidia got their bugged kill and cram this quote down the throats of some of the retard posters that followed.<br />
<br />
I couldnt care less about whether or not the ban was legit legit or not, but it always pissed me off when some moron claimed the ban was justified because &quot;zomg! Ensidia should have reported the bug and the quit working on the boss until it was fixed! its their fault for working on a bugged boss!&quot; End zone bosses are always bugged, and they dont always get fixed quickly. Sometimes the bugs make the fight harder, sometimes the bugs make it easier, but either way the World First guilds arent going to stop working on them. They just adapt and try and find a solution.</div></div><hr />

Because it would've been bloody stupid not to use it, seeing as how it makes the encounter easier and no-one else had killed it at that point. Pretty simple, really, if you spend even a few seconds thinking about it. 8]</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My butt is fine thanks for asking and though I'm glad you finnaly found a purpose in your life waiting for me to kill LK HC I'm affraid that'll be a while and despite me dissliking the buff having no penalty I assure you me and my guild will use it since extra everything? For free? HELL YEAH! <br />
I'm also not saying Paragon are bad players or a bunch or rtards. I'm just pointing out that claiming they would have downd him without the buff but then go with the buff anyways is not making any sense but I suspect the truth is that they were too carebear about getting a world first to show their penis is the bigger to actually prove they're pro gamers that don't need charity from Blizz in order to perform well even though they like to claim that they don't however that's just what I think.<br />
But I'll still feel (even though I'll be using it) that the buff is somewhat cheating and that there should be a penalty like you can't get achievments while using it just to encourage not using it and to actually make something in the game require some effort to get. And before you start trollin with link armory and &quot;I'll be eagerly awaiting your hard mode LK kill.&quot; no I wont link armory since that's what so great about the internet that you can say whatever the **** you want and noone will know who you are. I will however tell you that I'm as far as LK 25 normal after a sindra kill last week and done the 4 first bosses on HC 10man with an actual LK normal kill not just cheating using someone with hardmodes unlocked as RL and standing outside the instance even though the exploit isn't totally unused by our alts and I will provide no proof of this since what will happend next if I don't is what is so great about the internet. However you could choose to just take my word for it and leave it be but who are we kidding it's the internet it's pics or it didn't happend or tits or gtfo that applies here and I sure as hell wont show any tits either.<br />
<br />
And to the Ensidia fanboy butthurt replies like this on<br />
<br />
<br />
I can conclude one thing .... You'r an ensidia Fanboy, butthurt cause your favorite guild lost the race for 10 man heroic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I already stated that my butt is fine, what's with all this ass fixation? are you gay? na just kidding.. or am I?<br />
<br />
Now for the other stuff in the post.<br />
<br />
Celestial steed looks cool though lets hope it's hard to get. like completing all [Glory to the (insert raid) Raider (25-man)] not uber hard atleast not with ICC buff but atleast requiers you to set your foots inside a raid instance, not like getting T10..<br />
<br />
Tiger skin looks ok but looked better before imo but furries as furries I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
BREAKING NEWS! This is the point of view of one single individual on the internet and should not be considered the undeniable truth. If you dissagree it's not the end of the friggin world and you don't have to spend a single minute to prove this individual wrong just so you can watch your penis grow. There are plenty of other sites out there that's do that for you.</div></div><hr />

I kinda agree tbh. Not about the achievement as such (Who cares), but giving the buff in the heroic mode is a bit weak imo. It shouldn't even be available in heroic modes.<br />
<br />
Using the buff is even more disappointing. How can all these top guild keep complaining about &quot;content is too easy&quot; and still use a buff like this? I don't get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The gear difference between Paragon and the good 'strict' 10 man guilds (wearing a mix of 251 and 264 from ICC10) is nowhere near 30%, maybe around 10%, probably less.<br />
<br />
You're right that the average 10 man guild is going to need a full stack of the buff, but that's due to their crappy skills rather than their gear.</div></div><hr />

Could they have gotten the kill without it? Maybe, if the glitch was as severe as they make it out to be. But that's not how they think. The guild that kills the Lich King first while using the buff is going to get more recognition than the guild that kills him second without it. When you're going for a world first, you use every available resource to get it.<br />
<br />
From Paragon's perspective, the 5% buff wasn't a big enough crutch to be worth losing the world first over. That, and just about every guild who actually had a chance at getting the first kill was going to be using it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Please do not say the average 10 man guild has crappy skills. The average 10 man has average skills. However you are right, most average player will not see Hard Modes, especially Hard More Lich King.<br />
<br />
Plus I'm willing to bet good money that the majority of people who are skilled enough to do Hard Modes want the best gear; hence they gravitate towards 25 man raids by default. This means the amount of people who can do hard modes, plus want to focus on 10 man hard modes, is a very small pool.<br />
<br />
That doesn't change the fact though that 10 man hardmode with only 10 man gear is just as difficult as 25 man hardmode with 25 man gear. Also, unfortunately, 10 mans are much more reliant upon the classes they bring and synergy. That can have a huge effect on their capability since you simply cannot bring every buff.</div></div><hr />

No doubt someone might snag the &quot;no buff&quot; kill. The buff, however, definitely makes the encounter easier - there's no denying that. How many guilds do you figure will risk going in without? Once you toggle the buff off, you can't get it back. Imagine the frustration and disappointment in a guild if it turns out they lack the small extra bit of DPS, or their tank gets overkilled by a puny amount of damage.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing by far the majority of guilds will just settle on using the buff. Main goal at that point is probably trying to get just some kind of kill in the first place and practice the new phase. Then go and repeat it in the 25-man.</div></div><hr />

secondly woudl like to comment on that quote:<br />
<br />
<br />
At the risk of sounding like a troll or nut-hugger, I'd really like to be able to go back to when Ensidia got their bugged kill and cram this quote down the throats of some of the retard posters that followed.<br />
<br />
I couldnt care less about whether or not the ban was legit legit or not, but it always pissed me off when some moron claimed the ban was justified because &quot;zomg! Ensidia should have reported the bug and the quit working on the boss until it was fixed! its their fault for working on a bugged boss!&quot; End zone bosses are always bugged, and they dont always get fixed quickly. Sometimes the bugs make the fight harder, sometimes the bugs make it easier, but either way the World First guilds arent going to stop working on them. They just adapt and try and find a solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, when there is a race for world first stoping just cause there is a bug in the encounter is like in real life some marathon runner who is first stoping to help an old lady cross the road: nice but will potentially ruin your chances to go first unless all the runners behind you deside to give to take a break out of respect just sot hat the you can get theground you los for stoping to help the old lady back. which I doubt it is gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but then again once they saw it was unbugged they could have wiped and done it without it. i guess we just won't see until they release a video of it and we see how much time is left on the enrage timer<br />

anyhow gratz to them</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's not to get? I want to do the fight without the buff. In order to do this, I have to also convince my raid that it is worth it to do the fight without the buff. People look up to the world's best guilds for inspiration. If even the world's best guilds don't care about anything other than taking the easy way out, what chance do I have of convincing my group to do otherwise?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know that the 10man kill does not really count for anything, with or without buff.<br />
We all know the first 25man kill will use the buff.<br />
<br />
Now if a 10man strict guild does LK HC on 10man that will be truly impressive (more so if they do it without the buff if it is even possible). And I am sure that after LK HC dies on 25man, the top guilds will at least try him without the buff as well after achieving near BiS state (and perhaps kill him then). But it is the world first LK HC that will give a guild the #1 rank for WLK and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, 5% really isn't going to account for retards or perfect execution. 5% will not make you move out of void zone, not die in fires or perform inside the Frostmoune room. It' just a little bit of more HP, some bigger crit numbers. Full stop.<br />
<br />
All what's left is for some other guild to come in and say &quot;We kill Arthas HM with no buff, no flasks and no fish feast! Clearly, we got world first&quot;.<br />

These guilds do not perform in a vacuum. You take into account how awesome their gaming PCs are, how many different alts they are raiding this with, how lucky they were with loot and how much they used alt raids to favor mains in looting, how good RNG was with them on kill attempts, how many wipes they had on the boss before killing it, how much time was spent training on the boss across characters and the list goes on and on . . .<br />

Actually, it will. At 5%, it won't be a huge difference, but it'll still be there. You won't die in fire nearly as fast, healers can heal you better for standing in fire, you can dps harder in the frostmourne room. And what about once the buff reaches 30%? You're right in that boosting your stats doesn't help you move out of void zones or do mechanics with perfect execution. What it does is allow you to do mechanics very sloppily and poorly and still win, as well as allowing you to ignore some of them outright.</div></div><hr />

More tank health for soul reaper and most importantly, more dps. There are very few fights that do not become easier with more dps. Execution should and is always required, but the big cockblock on LK heroic seemed to be his health.</div></div><hr />

Is that the way it works? Yes. Is it the way it should work? No.<br />

<br />
There was a post in WF kills section even quoted by moderator that showed the attitude of end game player and WF's.<br />
Cant find it atm so i will just rephrase it in my words :<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not saying we killed him under 5minutes, without herbalist, without paladins or with ilvl2xx gear only. We said we killed him first. Fullstop.&quot;<br />
<br />
So actually if there is no penalty for not using that zone buff (aka worse loot drop, or such) there is no reason not to use it. Lich King did persist pretty long, despite many players screaming &quot;wtf easy kill inc&quot;. What should be done IMO was slowly grant zone buff to normal modes and after week or two also to HC modes so the competition would last longer. Raising the number of tries is ok for both.</div></div><hr />

Revenge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/57823/) damage has been slightly lowered, it now deals [ 31% of AP + 1636 ] to [ 31% of AP + 1998 ] damage at max rank. Down from [ 31% of AP + 2181 ] to [ 31% of AP + 2665 ] damage. (That's still much higher than the live version)<br />

<br />
Take a 52/7/12 PvP Arms spec http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior#gTlnrB1MJmYeg8,,11623<br />
(Yes, I know the spec could be better but I just worried about getting the Revenge improving talents).<br />
<br />
Increasing your Revenge damage you have:<br />
<br />
Blood Frenzy 2/2: 4% increase.<br />
Wrecking Crew 5/5: 10% increase.<br />
Unrelenting Assault 2/2: 20% increase.<br />
Improved Revenge 2/2: 60% increase.<br />
<br />
Total increase from talents: 1.04 * 1.1 * 1.8 = 2.0592 (assuming Improved Revenge and Unrelenting Assault stack additavely and multiplicitively).<br />
<br />
Now lets assume a 3% crit meta and 2/2 Impale:<br />
<br />
Crit damage = 2.2 * 1.03 = 2.26 times normal damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets give this warrior a pretty reasonable 6k attack power, i.e. a reasonably geared PvP warrior with self buff and a Hunter or DK on his team.<br />
<br />
Revenge damage baseline goes up to 31% of AP + 1998 = 3858 damage.<br />
<br />
With talents this gives 7945 damage.<br />
On crit this would be 17955 damage.<br />
<br />
How much will that be against a PvP target: at 1200 Resillience you have 15% damage reduced and a further 33% reduced from crits.<br />
<br />
Revenge would hit for 6753.<br />
Revenge would crit for 10226.<br />
<br />
This is a spammable, instant, practically free ability the warrior can use with a shield in defensive stance that will be critting for 10k+ against full resillience targets.</div></div><hr />

Yes there have always been 3 different textures for this model, this is just one of them, i remember having fun with model replacement for my feral druid and these creatures, had to ditch the idea because they were far more ugly than old-school feral forms. There is also female version of the creature, just as stupid looking.</div></div><hr />

whether they used the buff or not... whether they overgeared the encounter or not they are still the first guild to kill him on heroic mode.<br />
<br />
I personally understand why they used the buff as the race to world first kill is a close affair im sure and if I was good enough to be in there position i would have done the same BUT.. <br />
<br />
IMO the only World first kill that matters will be 25man heroic without the buff. That is currently the hardest fight in the game and whoever gets that will have earned the title &quot;best WoW raiding guild&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think most of the flaming is because of the cocky attitude that came through in their message. It is most definitely an amazing accomplishment that most players will never see. The issue most people have is with them seeming to blame their lack of success on a bug rather than the encounter being truly difficult rather than accurately blaming their success on the fact that they massively overgear the encounter and used the 5% buff. It will be a long long time before a dedicated 10 man kills him and even longer until someone does it without the buff. Regardless this is still quite an accomplishment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You know whats funny? You just care about the 10m kill because it is Paragon. If it would have been Ensidia you all would flame &quot;who cares about 10m?&quot;. <br />
Or am I wrong? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure a lot of people have been saying who cares its ten man. You people who care about which guild tag is attached to which world first need to get a better hobby. Then again I suppose the battle for Heroic LK first kill is like your Super Bowl.</div></div><hr />

Well rats, I figured the old 4 set bonus was worthless for disco priests, and that I would only need a 2 set bonus, which I could get from VOA. Figured the other slots could be won in the actual raid, so I have been selling my frost emblems for 3k per primordial saronite. The 40k+ Gold in my pocket is nice, but now I wish I had saved them for T10.</div></div><hr />

Why do the top-performing guilds have to put a spin on everything to make them sound so great?<br />
<br />
Paragon are turning into Ensidia &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
If they were so close to getting the kill last reset without the buff... why bother using it this time round?<br />
<br />
IMO: World First should ONLY be WITHOUT the buff, considering it is OPTIONAL.<br />

<br />
Second it have to follow a Dodge/Parry/Block<br />
<br />
Third add in armor ish 20-30% reduce from cloth - up to 65% reduce for tanks/bears<br />
<br />
<br />
First, revenge, untalented has a 5 second cooldown, not 6. With 2/2 Unrelenting Assault this is reduced to a 1 second cooldown, i.e. the warrior can use it every GCD. <br />
<br />
Second, a warrior, in pvp can certainly use shield block anytime he is getting focussed giving 100% block chance for 10 seconds, meaning anytime he gets focussed he can chain revenges back to back. Against any sort of fast attacking foe like a Rogue or Druid it will also proc a lot. With this a warrior could easily, for example, gib a priest the moment they use shadowfiend as they can just hit def stance, shield block, taunt the fiend and revenge spam the priest. Or taunt a ghoul or hunter pet and gib the owner. In fact, it would make focussing the warrior pretty much impossible for any team with melee DPS or a Hunter since doing so would just skyrocket the warriors dps.<br />
<br />
Third, again in PvP pretty much every warrior is, at the very least soft capped on ArP with some even being at or very close to the hard cap. The figure I picked for attack power, 6k is a figure that is very achievable for a warrior who is gemming and gearing his PvP gear for ArP. A warrior on a Pala / Hunter / DK team for example could get significantly more than that already. That is just with static buffs, throw in a Berzerking enchant, orc racial blood fury, trinket procs etc and a warrior can quite easily spike up to far above 6k attack power. With Deathbringer's Will proccing str, berzerking enchant proc and blood fury a warrior would have 1456 + 400 + 322 = 2178 extra attack power which would add 3142 damage to the normal crit or <br />
1790 damage to the crit vs a 1200 resillience target.<br />
<br />
With PvP gear as it exists right now a warrior could quite certainly be critting a full wrathful holy paladin for 10k+ with revenge. This would not involve the warrior totally regearing or regemming or changing how he gears for PvP in anyway. This is with the gear as warriors currently use it. <br />
<br />
Edit: Just a note, while the patch note says &quot;revenge damage has been slightly lowered&quot; this is in reference to the previous ptr patch where they increased it by 50%. The change just made leaves the 50% increase in scaling but removes the 50% increase in base damage, revenge damage would still be way higher than it is currently on live even without the additional 60% (up from 20%) damage from 2/2 Imp Revenge.</div></div><hr />

i have to say ive no idea what thats talk about<br />

<br />
before: you could only have Unstable Affliction OR Immolate up at the same time on a target. You could however spam Unstable Affliction on every enemy in sight<br />
<br />
now: You can only have Unstable Affliction OR Immolate up at the same time on a target. You CAN NOT spam Unstable Affliciton on every enemy in sight. Or, well you can, but whenever you put Unstable Affliction on something new, it will fade from your other mob/enemy player. <br />
<br />
Summary: Unstable Affliction is now max 1 up at any given time, like Haunt is already. In addition it cannot be applied together with Immolate (like before)<br />

£22 for a plushie is a bit of a dam ripoff and the Lil' KT and pandaren pets have shot up to $10/£9 each since release.<br />
Talk about a money hungry corporation. It's not like they don't get enough from the 10 million odd subscribers...<br />
<br />
Also, the plushies are $25. How on earth does that equate to £22? I know there's overheads and all but the exchange rate isn't that bad...<br />
<br />
There could be a mountain of reasons for the conversion rate. For example, the price is also €25, which in turn could be because they are more expensive to sell in Europe; if they're manifactured or even just distributed from the United States, they have to be sent over most likely to France, which costs in currency conversion fees, taxes and customs. In short, a $9 increase in price ($25 &gt; €25) is liable.<br />
<br />
Then, it must also be sent to the UK. More taxes, more customs. Since United Kingdom isn't a member of the EMU, there must also be further currency conversion fees.<br />
<br />
And yes, they might throw in one or two US Dollars extra on their own profit. However, most of the money they get from the increased cost is most likely, based on my best educated guesses and no research used on the fees.<br />
<br />
Remember, Plushies as opposed to Steam Store products (LOL $1=€1=£1) are actual physical entities. It's a lot more you need to take into account than with virtual products.</div></div><hr />

Pretty ****ing messed up considering it's 30% in the end. So casuals complain that Blizz made a hardmode for the more serious players so now Blizz have to make the hardmodes more casual... That's ****ed up.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing, just looking at the nature and skill level of casuals, I doubt they will be able to beat the hardmodes even WITH the 30% buff. I am a casual...I just don't have the free nights to do regular raid times, but this buff makes me kinda excited because I might actually stand a chance at seeing the Lich King and fighting him, versus just seeing replays of everyone else. Kind of like going back and doing The Sunwell Plateau. Even though at lvl 80 its insanely easy, it was still really cool to see from a lore and just excitement viewpoint.<br />
<br />
But when it comes to hardmodes, yeah, I think that having, in the end, a 30% buff, makes it not so hard. If Blizz wants to give away free cool mounts, why not just mail them to everyone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to diminish what Paragon done, but the main reason they got world first was because they extended their lockout on their 10 man run and Ensidia didn't, as muqq says on the ensidia site with a &quot;:(&quot; face. When it comes to world first's, even 10, taking the risk of locking your raidID is risky and it paid off for Paragon.<br />
<br />
This also adds more complexity to the race. Does Paragon now have a time bonus on 25 man because Ensidia had to clear 10 first, or does Ensidia have the edge because they got more 10 hc loot. Small difference, but in the end it could make the difference between fist and second.<br />
<br />
Either way, this has been one of the best races against 2 of the best guilds. All petty fighting aside, they both deserve it, but who wants it more...</div></div><hr />

I couldnt care less about whether or not the ban was legit legit or not, but it always pissed me off when some moron claimed the ban was justified because &quot;zomg! Ensidia should have reported the bug and the quit working on the boss until it was fixed! its their fault for working on a bugged boss!&quot; End zone bosses are always bugged, and they dont always get fixed quickly. Sometimes the bugs make the fight harder, sometimes the bugs make it easier, but either way the World First guilds arent going to stop working on them. They just adapt and try and find a solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ensidia: <br />
<br />
&quot;There's a bug in this encounter. Something is rebuilding the platform. (I'll give the benefit of the doubt and assume they didn't know what was doing it, although evidence seems to point to them knowing and deliberately exploiting). <br />
<br />
Sweet! Keep going, that'll make it easier to finish! We'll report it after we get the World First.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paragon: <br />
<br />
&quot;There's a bug in this encounter! It's way harder than it's supposed to be!<br />
<br />
Damn, that sucks. Report it now and we'll see if we can work around it.&quot;<br />
<br />
See a difference there? Ensida chose to make use of a bug that they admit they saw (although they may or may not have actually known why, or made a deliberate attempt to exploit it), but not report it until after it had helped them. Paragon tried to live with and work around a bug that hurt them, after reporting it immediately. Your comparison doesn't even make sense.</div></div><hr />

I seem to remember various Ensidia members saying that they had reported it and kept going with trying to get the kill. However, they didn't mention it in their report on the boss kill until after blizzard did so only the members of Ensidia will ever know for certain.<br />

And yes, they might throw in one or two US Dollars extra on their own profit. However, most of the money they get from the increased cost is most likely, based on my best educated guesses and no research used on the fees.<br />

Remember, Plushies as opposed to Steam Store products (LOL $1=&#8364;1=£1) are actual physical entities. It's a lot more you need to take into account than with virtual products.<br />

There's a choice to leave it present just like there's a choice to call down the watchers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard released this buff with knowledge that noone killed LKHM yet. Its an buff, optional or no, its buff.And it doesnt matter in which form.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard could just add additional ability to talent trees of every class with this stats. Result would be same, intention would be the same, and noone could QQ, because its part of their plans.<br />
<br />
Only reason why blizz put on/off button on this buff to avoid massive QQ from players, like &quot;OMG no another sunwell, you will ruin the game, omg no&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now you can disagree that this buff applied only to last raid, thus its not the same like in tbc. The buff itself is not, but considering that players had much more ilvls jump in wotlk than in TBC, naxxramas for lvl 80 casual geared players(ilvl 245gear let say) is the same faceroll like karazhan with -30% debuff, because difference between starting raid gear and ending raid gear is much bigger than in tbc.<br />
<br />
My point is that this game is directed by blizz, and they wouldnt release such buff if they wanted LKHM kill without it. Which is propably impossible without it, with gear level for raid size(most of 277 in 25m, most of 264 in 10man)<br />

I could care less who killed what first because they certainly won't be the last to kill it, and all we get is people wasting time complaining about who beat them to it. The buff shouldn't be a big deal because someone out there that complained about them clearing it with the buff could've cleared it and they wouldn't complain. It was added into the game to make it easier by Blizzard so it's not like they intentionally used some glitch or bug to win it like some guilds do. If I have to choose between not having the World First Achievements that comes packaged with the complaints of people that don't know how to accept a loss in the race, or having the world free of this kind of stupidity, I'd take the Ignorance Free option anyday.

I think you've misunderstood something, somewhere. LKHM will be killable without the buff, just as Yogg Saron was killable without the watchers present to give their buffs. If there isn't already an achievement for killing him on heroic without the buff then one will be added. It would be stupid of them not to.</div></div><hr />

You do know that you currently get a ton more honor from turning in the q for all marks? Also the marks will be gone in next patch, not gone gone but you can't obtain them anymore and this is the way Blizz is letting you get rid of any leftovers in your bags.</div></div><hr />

All who flame Paragon are stupid. If it's so easy, why aren't there hundreds of LK10 hardmode kills today? Because it's still pretty hard and the first ones who managed to kill him in that mode are Paragon. End of story. They win, you lose, next.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, there is no achievement for that. And no one is going to care. <br />
<br />
You still have to execute in boss fights, especially Lich King. It doesn't matter how much of a buff your raid has. If your raid is filled with a bunch of idiots you still won't go anywhere. Unless you're a top guild, and by top I mean no one posting in these forums including myself, MAYBE you turn off the buff just because you will be bored and it will become too easy. But I doubt it.<br />

Getting raids done faster is definitely more fun for me.</div></div><hr />

Remember - just because the top 0.1% guilds in the world are completing fights doesn't mean they are &quot;too easy&quot; for the other 99.9% of us. ;)<br />

Also - don't expect anyone to disable the buff, because blizzard has not given us any incentive to do so. No better loot, no additional achievements... nothing. So I'd say just relax and roll with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thing is, Top Guilds dont complain about content being too easy, also, World First competition is severe already, if you arent using the buff, you're at the disadvantage of another guild using the buff. <br />
People that are wiping on Festergut10 Normal are complaining content is too easy because they need to compensate their ego somewhere.<br />
<br />
But i'll quote someone else from earlier &quot;Why does nobody complains about using 25man heroic gear and have a set made of 264/277 in a 251/264 instance, yet they complains about 5% buff?&quot; <br />
<br />
Edit: I'm pretty sure now that Paragon has &quot;secured&quot; the world FIRST kill, they will try to pull it off again next week, without the buff, because they can. The world first of LK25 will be using the buff too, the week after, the guild is going to try it without the buff because its &quot;Added difficulty and added challenge&quot;, but they definetly arent going to be doing it week one.</div></div><hr />

so why make hardmodes when normal mode is a lot faster and easier? maybe you'll find the answer and no most hardmode raiders are not interested in loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The point he's making is that turning the buff off doesnt give more loot, doesnt give more achievements, doesnt give more ANYTHING. <br />
<br />
It gives added Difficulty and challenge, yes. But guilds are going to be trying to best themselves -after- they killed a boss once.<br />
<br />
The first time you will try to fight the Lich King, will you do &quot;Lets do it without Fort, Mark, Int, Flask or Food buff because it'll be harder!&quot; . No. You'll use Every possible buff you can get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elrondir</div><div class="date">2010-03-03, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note about the Celestial Steed - A few people reported that on the official site, Algalon is the last boss of the Vault of Archavon (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/dungeons/wrath/vault-of-archavon.xml) and assume that he will be available in this instance in a later patch. I would say that this is very unlikely, the official dungeons pages are greatly outdated (Ulduar is still shown as an &quot;unknown&quot; raid instance without any information) and this is most likely a very old error.<br />
updated with a couple of new effects and looks very nice as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Algalon end boss in VoA eh..<br />
So... Ulduar was merely a setback? Or what?<br />
But seriously, I wonder what the droprate on the mount will be.</div></div><hr />

Also, Blizz should add a Feat of Strength to kill heroic LK without the buff on imo.</div></div><hr />
