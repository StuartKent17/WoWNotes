Instance Capacity Issue Update<br />
As mentioned in previous updates, we have been working diligently to address recent instance capacity issues through a number of reconfigurations and optimizations. These modifications have been an ongoing effort, and we’re pleased to announce that the process is now complete on all North American realms. Since the optimizations, all realms have shown an improvement in instance performance as well as a noticeable reduction in the amount of players hitting the instance limit. Please be assured that we will continue to monitor the situation closely and will make further changes as necessary. As always, thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this issue. <br />
<br />
Arena Title Issue<br />
During the process of awarding the titles for Arena Season 6, we encountered an issue where characters who earned the titles in previous seasons, but did not earn them in season 6, received them again along with the corresponding achievements. We have found the cause of this and will be removing the unearned titles and achievements during the next regularly scheduled maintenance. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
And this is what happens when I skip blue posts for a day, a huge wall of blue text. <br />
Stats Inflation<br />
Some stats can grow forever and yet the abilities they affect generally behave the same way. Things like crit, haste, armor pen and avoidance (generally the numbers that convert into a percentage) start to get weird at very high numbers. We design using the range of those values that make sense. To use an analogy, if your thermometer only goes up to 105 F, that's probably fine for Michigan but lacking in Arizona. The range on the instrument was designed for one range of numbers and might not work for another.<br />
<br />
The problem in LK was we ended up growing the gear by more than we expected. Had we known that in hindsight, the rating conversions would probably have been less favorable to begin with so that we'd be talking about mages with 50 to 60% crit rates now instead of 70 to 80% crit rates.<br />
<br />
The avoidance rates on tanks are probably more problematic than the crit rates on dps specs -- high avoidance led us to Sunwell Radiance in the past. The alternative is that bosses have to hit so hard that if you ever fail to avoid twice in a row, you wipe (or the bosses are just very easy). Tanks should be avoiding at say 30% not 50%.<br />
<br />
Just remember all this if the ratings are even steeper in Cataclysm and you see your crit rate drop with each new character level. The alternative is that you get to 100% crit too quickly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19595732241-why-does-combustion-have-a-3-min-cooldown.html))<br />
<br />
T9 Set Bonuses<br />
A major goal of 3.2 was to implement a fairly simple raiding tier (when compared to 3.1 and 3.3) so that we could focus on development of the new BG. The relatively simplistic set bonuses reflect that general philosophy. Set bonuses are among the most challenging parts of itemization: they are technically hard to implement, it's tough to come up with good ones that you haven't seen a hundred times, we need something that can benefit a variety of specs, and they have to actually be desirable. Perhaps in retrospect, more crit was not the best thing we could have put on mage gear, but at the same time, we need a system where we don't have to avoid giving a class a stat it actually wants.<br />
<br />
P.S. You shouldn't read too much into my comments above about how various content patches will be developed in the future. We tried an extreme raid with Ulduar and Icecrown will also be a blow-out in that sense. That doesn't mean the pattern will always be large / small / large or anything. We like to experiment with different things to see what works and also so we don't fall into too much of a predictable pattern.

<br />
Anub'arak Hotfix<br />
Ok, we just deployed a hotfix that will repair all broken saved raids of the Crusader's Coliseum that did not have Barrett Ramsey properly spawn. Without Barrett Ramsey, raids are unable to start the event that grants access to the final boss. You will have to soft reset the instance again if you already have your broken instance open, but Barrett should be back after that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/19675818224-anubarak--floor-reappears-after-a-soft-reset.html))<br />
<br />
Dual Specialization Costs<br />
We don't currently have any plans to reduce the gold cost of Dual Specializations. 1000g isn't really all that hard to come by if you indulge in a few dailies here and there, or you go hit some heroics, selling Runed Orbs or gems as you see fit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19717392133-bluesany-plans-to-reduce-cost-of-dual-spec.html))<br />
<br />
Heroic ToC Bosses hitting too hard?<br />
I still stand by the statement. Most of your examples seem to be Gormok's Impale which has a lot more going on (dots, tank transitions) than just hitting a single tank really hard. Those encounters drop really high level gear. If you're tanking him with item level 226 (because you've only been in the instance 5 weeks and maybe your tanks haven't gotten a lot of drops) then you've got some deficit to make up. The good news is that because of the way loot works in that instance, you can choose to gear your tanks really quickly if you so desire.<br />
<br />
Yes, you will still need to work to keep your tanks up. That's just part of hard mode. But my suspicion is still that the community won't jump to tank class choice as the explanation for why a certain fight is easier or harder for them. Or, more realistically, they still will, but... alas. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19717352338-bosses-wont-hit-for-40k.html))<br />
<br />
High Tank Damage<br />
If we just chilled out tank damage, then healing would be a lot easier. While I know it's popular in this forum to claim that we only want to make life hard for the healers, I think in reality many of you would get bored or risk losing your spot when the raid didn't need as many healers.<br />
<br />
A better answer, in our opinion, is to increase tank health and have bosses hit hard but not as often. The end result would hopefully be that it took several big heals to bring a tank back up rather than a single Holy Light crit. Currently overhealing isn't particularly scary because mana is cheap and the risk of the tank (or anyone dying) on a given GCD is very real.<br />
<br />
If you currently put say 3 healers on the tank that isn't because it requires that much healing per second to keep the tank alive. Instead, it's because with 3 healers hopefully someone will be always casting and can land a heal after big hit one but before big hit two, which would kill the tank. If a few hots or shields get stomped on along the way, oh well.<br />
<br />
Ideally, you put 3 healers on the tank because it takes 3 big heals to get the tank back up. If you don't coordinate well or use a big heal when a medium heal would do, then you'd risk too much overhealing and ultimately running out of mana. You'd need to heal smart as well as just healing fast and big, which is what the current design really encourages.<br />
<br />
I predict health pools of all players will go way up in Cataclysm relative to player damage and healing. Everything (meaning PvP too) would be slowed down just a little so that making the right choice would sometimes trump making the fast choice. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/19675688396-why-not-abandon-high-tank-damage.html))<br />
<br />
Are buffs durations too short for ToC fights?<br />
With the paladin buffs, resources are never an issue. You generally don't have to worry about renewing the buff when it falls off because you'll have enough mana unless you're near the end of the fight or something has gone wrong. For that reason it felt like just a hassle to have to renew them and we ultimately increased the durations.<br />
<br />
With warrior shouts, the intent is that the resources do matter. You might not have enough rage at any given moment and part of the skill required in playing a warrior is making sure you have enough resources to both shout and do your other damage.<br />
<br />
I can appreciate that that design might not be particularly compelling, but I'm not sure the solution is to just let shouts last forever. I think Horn of Winter might actually be a stronger design in that sense. Imagine (I am arm waving for a moment) that Battle Shout and Commanding Shout didn't cost any rage and in fact gave you rage, but were on a cooldown. Then using the shouts might become a more interesting choice -- you'd want to use them at moments when you're rage-starved and generally not when you have a full bar. However, you'd also want to keep them going because of their buff so you couldn't neglect to use them too often either. A challenge of playing the class / a test of your skill would be to shout at the right moment to keep the buff up but also make sure you earn the rage when you most needed it.

Faction Change not available yet in Europe<br />
It is standard policy for us to not announce specific dates for this kind of service or for things like patches. It isn't an EU thing, it is a Blizzard thing. We are not leaving you &quot;in the dark&quot; without good reason, and the reason is not the one you suggest. One of the reasons is simply because we do not want to raise expectations and then squash them again. Experience has shown us that doing that is actually much worse.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the release of this much awaited service in the US does implicitly raise excitement and expectations, and this is quite clearly evident by the popularity of this thread today.

Diseaseless rotations<br />
The diseaseless issue wasn't a big problem with Unholy builds per se, but the fact that diseases could potentially be ignored led us to nerf base damage and buff per disease damage of all the strikes. We could potentially have Scourge Strike benefit from diseases more than other strikes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19382697597-scourge-strike--still-a-problem-gc.html))<br />
<br />
Unholy DPS<br />
Unholy is alive and well. The spec is just using Obliterate instead of Scourge Strike. But the two abilities are almost identical in the first place. You're not changing your game up that much to replace one FU ability with another. It's not ideal and we'll get it fixed but it's not as if the entire spec is dead or using a mostly Frost build or anything. At most you're not benefiting from some of the talents that focus on SS or Shadow damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19675858244-elitist-jerks-close-thread-on-unholy-dk.html))<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration's effect on DPS<br />
I'm not sure this is really an armor pen issue (though I could be wrong here). Blood doing such high dps is probably an armor pen issue. Obliterate beating out Scourge Strike is likely not because of armor pen. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19675858244-elitist-jerks-close-thread-on-unholy-dk.html))<br />
<br />
Scourge Strike / Obliterate<br />
If Unholy itself was non-viable, then it would be a much bigger issue. (And, no, you can't equate Unholy with Scourge Strike to try and define Unholy as non-viable.) If hitting Obliterate instead of Scourge Strike radically changed your playstyle or second to second decisions then it would be a big issue. As an example, if you just used Blood Strike and never a FU attack at all, we would consider that game-breaking. But as I say many times, these things are subjective and I can't expect the community to always place the same priority on things that we do.<br />
<br />
I can appreciate that you might just like Scourge Strike. But given that we have limited bandwidth in which to solve class problems (and given that the Blizzard solution is never to just hire more inexperienced people to try and help us tackle more at once), we have to prioritize things. <br />
<br />
[...] I would add that PvP Unholy DKs will also still use Scourge Strike, because it wins over Obliterate when the target is not sundered. Your target better be sundered in PvE but often is not in PvP.<br />
<br />
It's also fine if some players can be moderately successful with Shadowfrost (which I am defining here as a DK that largely ignores melee attacks). We just don't want a return to the world where that was the only way to play a DK.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is still that we understand Unholy DKs want to use Scourge Strike and we want that too. In the meantime, using Obliterate gives you a pretty similar experience to using Scourge Strike. Going 51 Frost or using nothing but Icy Touch does not (and again it's subjective). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19675858244-elitist-jerks-close-thread-on-unholy-dk.html))<br />

Prot healing in PvP<br />
The Prot healing style in PvP is nerfed in 3.2.2. We have not announced a date for 3.2.2, but it will be long before the season ends. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19675728341-thank-you-for-keeping-prot-paladins-with-s7.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
Infinite Rage<br />
Infinite rage is not our intent for the warrior, when dps or tanking. Rage is one of the core mechanics for the warrior along with stances. You already don't get much out of stances as a tank. If you also don't have to pay attention to resources then you're not really going to get the experience playing the class that we intend.<br />
<br />
When I say stuff like that, the inevitable result is &quot;OMG GC sez they're going to nerf our rage.&quot; That's not what I mean. Warrior tanks have been balanced around their current condition of having (near) infinite rage and we'd have to make additional changes if we get to the point where you need to pay more attention to it.<br />
<br />
As an example, back when threat was a lot bigger issue in fights (think Voidreaver or Vael), then smart warriors would advocate spending some of their itemization on threat stats. I think it might have been Satrina who advocated using a dps weapon to tank since you can put survivability in every other slot. If warrior tanks generated more of their rage by doing damage than taking damage, then a lot of stuff might get fixed: dps stats would be more valued (without going back to threat-limiting fights), you wouldn't be rage-starved when avoiding or OT'ing, and tanking could be a little bit more about using the right ability at the right time and not just when it's on cooldown.<br />
<br />
DKs don't have infinite resources at any given point in time, and while it has caused some design challenges, I think it makes for a more interesting experience overall. We can debate about whether Prot paladins have mana issues, but they still have to do something to get mana back. (As an aside, Ret paladins generally don't have mana issues, but that has also led to a system that is very cooldown-driven and one where we've had a hard time nailing both fun and balance at the same time.)<br />
<br />
In any case, if rage mattered a little more to Prot warriors then Commanding Shout for rage would be a more interesting mechanic. Again, this is not an announced change -- just a little brainstorming to in turn encourage additional discussion in this thread.

We don't currently have any plans to reduce the gold cost of Dual Specializations. 1000g isn't really all that hard to come by if you indulge in a few dailies here and there, or you go hit some heroics, selling Runed Orbs or gems as you see fit. (Source)<br />

1000g is nothing.<br />

The avoidance rates on tanks are probably more problematic than the crit rates on dps specs -- high avoidance led us to Sunwell Radiance in the past. The alternative is that bosses have to hit so hard that if you ever fail to avoid twice in a row, you wipe (or the bosses are just very easy). Tanks should be avoiding at say 30% not 50%.<br />
<br />
Just remember all this if the ratings are even steeper in Cataclysm and you see your crit rate drop with each new character level. The alternative is that you get to 100% crit too quickly. (Source)<br />
<br />
Stat ratings was the best idea ever.<br />
The alternative would have been to allow 2x damage, or 3x damage if you get a 200% or 250% crit hit.<br />

<br />
Mage gear?<br />
Rogue gear T8 set bonus is twice as good (if not more) than the T9 set bonus...<br />
There's no point replacing the set until you get all 4 parts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I predict health pools of all players will go way up in Cataclysm relative to player damage and healing. Everything (meaning PvP too) would be slowed down just a little so that making the right choice would sometimes trump making the fast choice. (Source)<br />
<br />
Considering people lose a variety of stats on gear and get stamina in return.<br />
&quot;and&quot; can lower 1 stat to boost another stat not already present on gear (though that's unlikely to ever be stamina except on weapons or trinkets), yeah, stamina is going to go skyhigh.<br />
I expect my rogue will be running around with 30K or 40K health in Cata.<br />

One would be a fool to believe that other Top 10 Hardcore Raiding guilds (i.e. guilds such as Ensidia, Method, Inner Sanctum) don't do this. It's a part of min/maxing really, and with the limited attempts in Trial of the Grand Crusader they want to make the best out of their tries. A death makes a huge impact in these fights, they want to avoid situations where deaths can lead to a wipe ;)</div></div><hr />

I remember Nihilum got pretty much their entire raid Soulstoned for their World First Kel'Thuzad in Vanilla. Then again, at that time out-of-raid Soulstoning was still possible.</div></div><hr />

lvl 1-80 is there to learn how to play with your class. but how is a healer going to learn how to heal when he's got a dmg specc to lvl? yes he can heal with a dmg specc, but for most classes it will be a complete different heal style than with a healspecc. same goes for tanks.<br />
this is especially true for new players who dont have any &quot;main&quot; to borrow money from.</div></div><hr />

If it were an exploit, Blizzard would have fixed this ages ago and made Soulstones disappear before zoning into an Instance. Well, they partly fixed it by not allowing out-of-raid Soulstones. Instead of 25 Soulstones you can now only have a maximum of 15. (not including any Warlocks Mains) <br />

It's not just soulstones, either. You can get almost all buffs, even if they're just 10-min pala buffs that aren't raid bound. BoK is a seriously useful buff in 10-man. They really ought to put limits on this sort of thing; having buffs disappear when the caster leaves the instance, for example. It can't be too difficult.</div></div><hr />

That's the very reason they are creating new Leatherworking Drums in patch 3.2.2. They are craftable by Leatherworkers yet usable for EVERYONE, even by people without Leatherworking. Obviously they are slightly less powerful, but that way you can still get the buffs if you lack people. <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Drums of Forgotten Kings<br />
http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49633/drums-of-forgotten-kings/<br />
&quot;Use: Gives all members of the raid or group the Blessing of Forgotten Kings, increasing total stats by 8% for 30 min.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drums of the Wild<br />
http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49634/drums-of-the-wild/<br />
&quot;Use: Gives the Gift of the Wild to all party and raid members, increasing armor by 750, all attributes by 37 and all resistances by 54 for 1 hour.&quot;</div></div><hr />

They stack over 25, yes. As long as you don't become Valiant with all cities (and thus don't have access to Valiant dailies any more) you can do the dailies to get them.</div></div><hr />

Then you'd have to farm a lot for the mats (which they tried to avoid this expansion killing oils and such) and/or have a item that soulstones the entire raid, which would totally change the dynamic of fights since everyone would be able to combat res at least once. <br />
<br />
Personally I'd make one of the following: make the Soulstone a raid wide buff that is spent as soon one raid member resurrects, or make the soulstone just like the regular combat ress.</div></div><hr />

I suspect blizzard does not find this to be an intended feature and will eventually limit the max number of people you can have in a raid depending on the difficulty you've set.<br />
<br />
<br />
Easy to fix: limit the raid spots to 25 players. The only problem is the old 40 mans raids, for BGs it is automatic now so it isint a problem, so most like they could add a option for 40 man raids just like you set the dificult to heroic/normal. If you choose 40 man raid spots, it is set to normal if you try to join another raid instance, since MC/BWL/etc dont have heroic modes.</div></div><hr />

Eh, then you run into trouble with people waiting for spots in the raid not being in the raid... I'd say drop it to 30, you can have your waitlist without having the whole raid SS'd.</div></div><hr />

but making this baseline for people starting, that have no clue how to play and are told &quot;oh hey, while you learn to play the game, why don't you learn it from 2 pov at once ?&quot; is retarded, i remember when i started playing and i was newb as hell, had poor specs etc, and why put the presure on new players that they need to KNOW THE GAME before they actually learn it, and have 2 specs?</div></div><hr />

This analogy would work better if you were using greater blessing of kings and stayed in the group with said person you randomly buffed to ensure they had the buff.<br />
<br />
Even then, there's a lot more to putting up a soulstone on multiple people in a raid environment than just randomly buffing a player you're running by.</div></div><hr />

And more normally I run with up to six shamans who can all reincarnate themselves on critical boss attempts, sometimes with myself and another druid healing for two battlerezes on the tanks.<br />
<br />
Is that cheating? :|a<br />
<br />
More on-topic, very nice kill, Paragon! And I'm pleased to see they're using their healers to thin out the wrong-color orbs on either side to spare the damage load on the DPS; I'm trying to convince the other healers in my raid to do that with me and may just point them at this video as my reasoning.<br />
<br />
ETA: I had to answer this:<br />
<br />
Do you seriously think Blizzard wants to balance encounters around out of raid soulstoning?<br />
They have. It's called a persistent AoE that does more damage than the 400 health that you resurrect with from a level 18 soulstone. Twin Val'kyrs have a pulsing aura that does a combined 5000 damage every two seconds. Pop up at the wrong moment and you'll be eating floor again before anyone can heal you.<br />
<br />
Speaking from a druid healer's perspective, all of the fights in normal TotC25, let alone heroic, can be tricky to battle-rez on. Northrend beasts all have a variable amount of AoE (though the last half of Gormok has none, thankfully, unless you're melee), Jaraxxus has an absurd amount of random raid damage, faction champs also, twin Valks has the aforementioned aura, and Anub'arak has the penetrating cold dot, the adds, and later his AoE aura. Rank 1 soulstones are pretty paltry insurance compared to a top-rank battlerez, soulstone, or reincarnation. c: But if it makes them feel better, they can have their security blanket.</div></div><hr />

They aren't mandatory to raid.. and the encounter isn't tuned assuming that half the raid is stoned. They used it cause they were going for top kills, and it makes it easier due to the cushion of tons of rezzes.</div></div><hr />

@ you and anyone else asking how we know they are soulstoned. See that huge block of purple on the left hand side? those are soulstone timers.<br />
Not everyone in the raid is soulstoned, the people that died/were rebirthed are the ones who did not have a soulstone. Notice when the people die... none of the purple bars disappear (signifying the soulstone has faded) Now if you also notice, when the druids rebirth orange bars come up. These signify rebirth cooldowns. Obviously the pink one is a lay on hands cooldown.<br />
<br />

I had to strain for half a month at the release of Wrath to get Epic flying, and I had the inflation of glyphs and new leatherworking recipes, it still took forever.<br />

Now it would likely be that hard just to get 1000g since the prices have likely bottomed out entirely on everything and the only recipes worth a crap come from raids which most don't have access to.<br />

<br />
You absorb orb damage from the orbs of the same color as your buff. The tank tanking the light Val'kyr would have the dark buff, so he would eat dark orbs and try to avoid light ones. (I assume since you've tanked this before you know that and just tangled up your darks/lights, so I'm just clarifying. XD) Absorbed damage eventually converts to an Empowered Darkness or Empowered Light buff (=ridiculous TPS). Sometimes it's just not possible to avoid an orb of the wrong color, though, which is actually why I recommend--and I assume why Paragon has--healers taking the &quot;wrong&quot; color for the side they're on and thinning out those orbs on their side. They'll absorb the damage, get speed boosts to avoid the orbs that are wrong-colored for them (and right-colored for the DPS on their side), and generally make their own lives easier by cutting down on incoming raid damage.<br />
<br />
The tank would NOT want to have the same color buff as the Val'kyr he's tanking. It would drop his TPS through the floor, as they take much-reduced damage from players of the same color as they are. ETA: Additionally, on hard mode, I believe they add a Thaddius-like ability where players of opposite polarities injure each other when inside a certain range. And since everyone's stacked up on the tank to facilitate AoE smart heals, it would rapidly get Bad if the tank had the same color as the Val'kyr he's on and everyone else had the opposite color...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I got confused a bit, modified my post to clarify my understanding. What I do when I tank the light valkyr is take the light buff. I don't think it's wrong or a mistake since I still can generate about 3-5k tps and the light damage absorb is essential to mitigating as much damage as I can from the light valkyr I am tanking. In that case I would take light orbs so I can get the empowered light, and that will increase my tps which is already low but still high enough so dps won't pull off me. And I would take black orbs only if they make a beeline for the dark buffed dps group so they don't have to move around to avoid it which can reduce their dps. <br />
<br />
I have not tanked this on hardmode so I would imagine I would need the dark debuff since TPS might be an issue. But with all the possible rogues/hunters transfering threat to you and having various threat reduction abilities from mages/hunters/warlocks/mage/etc would make TPS a little less important for this fight.</div></div><hr />

I may pass that on to our raid, since we do it with the tanks taking the same debuff as their side. But we're also notorious for issues with caster threat (having crit-crazy elemental shamans who all empower at the same time will do that to you), so the TPS is more of an issue for us versus the inbound damage on the tank. Also, we typically only have one hunter and one rogue, so there's not a whole lot of threat transfer going on (the warrior tank is with the melee group, so Vigilance is out, too). Still, it's worth consideration. :) Thank you for explaining that!<br />
<br />
Also, speaking from a mage POV, a lot of mages don't take their threat reduction talents anymore because we assume you're putting out enough TPS for us not to blow ourselves into a fine red mist. ;) WTB Mage misdirect, PST...</div></div><hr />

They definitely aren't mandatory, but they can easily save a wipe or two that couldn't otherwise be avoided. We had a few Anub'Rekhan saves with the stones atleast - the attempt would've otherwise been completely ruined if it weren't for the lvl 18 soulstoning.<br />
<br />
Personally, I dislike the fact that the mechanic exists in the game. So does pretty much rest of Paragon, I figure - but it's there and it makes absolutely no sense to _not_ use it to our advantage. Prior to the patch (actually pretty much as soon as I read about the limited tries) I made a suggestion on the official forums to fix this particular issue. No-one really cared, the thread died rather quick. We came to the conclusion that everyone would level up a warlock that can soulstone as it wasn't going to get 'fixed' in any way.<br />
<br />
I'm not really defending the fact that we used tons of alt locks and offline soulstones nor do I need the feel for that - we're using mechanics that are available to us. I personally couldn't care less what people think of us using it. I care what people think of the mechanic overall - personally I'd love nothing more than for it to get removed as it's horrible. If anyone is on the same boat with me, please go spam the official forums about it. Level 18 stoning is utter crap. While you're at it, go on the barricades about combat ressing too.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's worse, though, than the soulstones by far is the fact that the PCT is on a 3-day cooldown. This means that you could've had 150 attempts worth of wipes on 25-ToC heroic on the opening week. Waste 50, transfer, clear normal + hard. Waste 50 again, transfer, and you get 1 more day of wiping. The day after that you would've had 50 attempts again. That's _200 attempts_ in a span of 8 days and a crap ton of gear and badges. The upgrades for the raid are massive if you're willing to throw money at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
So far I've liked the philosophy behind WoW that you cannot get an advantage over people by paying IRL gold to Blizzard. That all has changed, apparently. Not a particularly bad move on their part - it'll definitely create a good amount of revenue, and not enough people really care anyway. But as a player who's playing the game, I'm disgusted.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm honestly quite pissed off at the amounts of 'hoops' you potentially have to jump through if you want to be on the very bleeding edge of raiding while using every advantage you can possibly get. It's not like Blizzard is oblivious to all these tricks; it's just that not enough players care and thus Blizzard won't (have to) do anything about it.</div></div><hr />

*patpat* It's okay. X) I really didn't mean to be gratuitously cruel. It was just very silly!<br />
<br />
I tend to look for what faction the raid is right off the bat when watching videos if it's not obvious from the player's HUD. I may just be a dork.<br />
<br />
@zYN: Well, can you blame them? If laziness would keep 99.9% of the playerbase from attempting it, and it would require x additional programmer hours of work on their part, why not let laziness do the work until that percentage comes closer to something that would have a significant impact on their profit margin? That's to the PCT thing, of course, not the soulstoning thing. I assume they've left soulstoning in for the reasons I mentioned upthread--for a bleeding-edge raid, it will mean the difference between a wipe and survival; for J. Random Weekend Raid, people are going to rez themselves into AoE and just end up with double the repair bills for a wipe. Maybe put an upper level range on soulstones so it's not quite so easy? Because removing the soulstone if the warlock goes offline in the raid could be catastrophic if the warlock has a bad connection.<br />

as soon as you can use Rebirth outside of the instance and offline then yea we can start QQ about it.

and its really easy to use, so i dont think it will confuse new players. and if it does just make a questline that explains the whole thing and activates the feature.<br />
<br />
I leveled in vanilla. Anybody leveling has it easier than I did whether I care or not (I don't). I don't even know why twinking would be relevant since unless you're twinking at level 60 you get no talents worth talking about.<br />
If you hadn't noticed, there's no questlines explaining the game. That's not part of how WoW does things. And I agree that it's really useful for a healing character but it's also not at all necessary (I only have it on 2 characters) and it's a useful money sink for an economy already glutted with gold.</div></div><hr />

It's a part of min/maxing really, and with the limited attempts in Trial of the Grand Crusader they want to make the best out of their tries. A death makes a huge impact in these fights, they want to avoid situations where deaths can lead to a wipe ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
We havent done this no, cant blame Paragon for doing it tho.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Grats on the kill and for the off topic, Ensidia have done all attempts, next week for them<br />
<br />
But i hope some guild manage to down him this week<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice, my guild raided without me and spent all our tries :/<br />
(We still got tries left....)<br />
<br />
<br />
And gz Paragon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annoying</div><div class="date">2009-09-04, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys noticed the soulstones but didn't notice that this kill looks pretty fake. Unless i'm totally mistaken the twin dropped a trophy, trophies shouldn't drop in 25man heroic(should be 258IL armor token) and I never saw the Twins cast Touch of Dark/Light, which is their new ability in heroic version. My guild hasn't done any 25man heroics yet because we got screwed by server uptime and then the anub bug but this doesn't look like heroic to me.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Upon further investigation paragon DOES have credit for 25man heroic twins on armory but that doesn't answer my questions. Why does a trophy drop in this video and not a 258 token(are those only from tribute chest?) and why doesn't it appear that people are being affected by Touch of Light/Dark?(bugged perhaps?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Trophys drop. the 258 is from the chest only.<br />
They aren't changing color for touch of light/dark, only 3 people get it at a time, and they simply heal through it.</div></div><hr />

On the topic of mass soulstones, last time I heard about this was back on Al'ar, and even then my guild (Forte) didn't use it while several other guilds, just for example Last Resort, did.</div></div><hr />

Thats just Lame.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hah, that one isn't quite that bad actually. It's a nice bonus. But that they just want to shove Nourish down our throats is hilarious. The only fight that spell has had a use for me, is Gormok the Impaler on Heroic.</div></div><hr />

Our druids are freakin deaf and will never battle res a healer because they don't want to waste a cooldown, then they wonder why people start dying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Paragon and warlocks: meh, I'm sure other guilds do the same, not big deal. You don't get to be one of the best guilds in the world without having something like this one the side. Besides you don't get to be part of guilds like this without being uber-skilled. Full raid SS'ing is just a tactic to use while learning fights to maximize attempts.</div></div><hr />

Very fun fight though i must say.</div></div><hr />
