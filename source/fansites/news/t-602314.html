<br />
Great items right ? You're already planning to form a small raid to farm trash only and get all the shiny epics right ? You can't.<br />
<br />
There are indeed protections put in place that should make it extremely difficult for very small groups of players to activate the Battle of Mount Hyjal event and be rewarded with either reputation or items from killing the incoming enemy creatures before the players suffer a defeat. Whenever an enemy wave spawns, there's a check done to see if you've killed enough of the enemy creatures. If you haven't, then loot/rep is disabled for that wave of spawns. If you have killed enough, then that wave and further waves of creatures leading up to the next boss have loot/reputation.<br />
<br />
Under relatively normal conditions where a full raid is attempting to fight through the enemy waves of creatures to defeat a boss, all creatures past the first wave should reward reputation and have a chance at item loot.<br />
<br />
These kinds of protections were necessary so as to not promote the creation and activation of large numbers of Hyjal instances, which could lead to performance problems for the server.<br />
<br />
Reputation<br />
Trash monsters : 2-3 Reputation points.<br />
Frostwyrms : 15 Reputation points.<br />
Bosses : 200 Reputation points.<br />
Archimonde : 500 Reputation points.<br />
<br />
The huge nerf of Archimonde's reputation reward basically made the reputation rewarded during a full clean of Hyjal Summit lower (about 100 points) than in 2.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.2 Undocumented changes<br />
There is also a post going on the official forums (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778015283&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#0) listing all the official changes.<br />
<br />
World<br />
New music added to Honor Hold as well as the inns of Ironforge, Stormwind, and Ratchet<br />
Cho Threadstrong has new sayings he shouts at the fruit vendor (poor fruit vendor)<br />

Thunderfury' proc does the same thing as Evocate, Cyclone and Windfury (consider it an epilog)<br />
Spectral Tiger Mount (and Swift Spectral Tiger) updated with brighter armor and fewer seems<br />
The Astromages inside of the Mechanar had their fire aura effect changed in appearance. Much taller now and has a different graphic surrounding them<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
UI &amp; Game Mechanics<br />

Wide screen UI scales differently<br />

New Auction house alert: &quot;A buyer has been found for your auction of X&quot;<br />

<br />
Not necessarily a blip in lore.* Take a look at it in this context, however far-fetched and contrived as it may be.** <br />
<br />
Despite proclaiming himself lord of all Outland, we all know the main reason Illidan is there is because he's hiding from Kil'jaeden's wrath for his failure in destroying the Lich King.* He's fighting a losing battle against the Legion and, as revealed in his dialogue w/ Akama, he's aware of Kael's duplicity.* Facing an increasingly uphill and losing battle and perhaps fueled by both his need for self-preservation and his deepening madness, he sees funnelling his own demonic reinforcements to Mount Hyjal to aid the Legion in Archimonde's conquest of the World Tree and the subsequent alteration of time as the only way to truly escape Kil'jaeden's wrath.* With history altered, Archimonde would have conquered Azeroth and there would be no unification of Arthas and the Lich King, thus Illidan would ultimately succeed in the mission Kil'jaeden charged him with in The Frozen Throne.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-09-26, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Illidan had JUST GOTTEN the skull of Gul'dan as The Battle of Mount Hyjal began, the Illidari wasn't formed until Illidan got to Outland and was with Akama, Kael'thas, and Vashj, and took over the Black Citadel/Temple and stole Magtheridon's forces.<br />
<br />
He didn't send reinforcements, its Blizzards &quot;Gameplay &gt; Lore&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I failed to clarify, &quot;What if Illidan was sending reinforcements into the past?&quot;** Its sounds far-fetched, but we're also talking about you travelling back in time as well which would also screw lore unless your identities were kept nameless.* The past has no idea of your true identity, nor would they have any idea who the Illidari were.* It'd just be assumed that the Illiari were more Legion conscripts and, save those bound to the present timeline, nobody would be the wiser.<br />
<br />
Your next question will be, how the hell does Illidan get reinforcements back in time? Well, how exactly did the Infinite Dragonflight manage to get into the Caverns of time and attempt to tamper with the time line at Durnholde and the Black Morass?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right and I'm sure you're probably as pissed as I am that Blizzard has declined to flesh out more details regarding the origins, motives, and allegiances the Infinite Dragonflight holds. I was hoping to see more Infinite Dragonflight interference in Hyjal, but such was not the case, nor will it be in the upcoming Old Stratholme apparently.<br />
<br />
I'm furious that they've been completely written out after being used in Durnholde and Black Morass. &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thats funny, we got 4 (yes four) Tanking cloaks yesterday ... sick<br />
<br />
We also got BT Trashloot btw, the nice Shadwo Damage cloak as well as the Patterns for the Nimble Thought Mantle. This and the added rep really makes wiping less annoying in MH :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benhoof</div><div class="date">2007-09-27, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another change I don't think has allready been mentioned.<br />
<br />
There is a new knock down and stand up animation. Instead of just popping up after a knockdown, the character has now a smooth, good-looking stand up animation.<br />
<br />
I noticed it yesterday during a Blood Furnace heroic run. Some mobs there knock down the tank. We had a male undead warrior, so I can confirm that the new animation is present for them at least. I cannot say anything about other races/genders for sure.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Had time to look through the game files with the modelviewer and can confirm that there is a &quot;knockdown&quot; animation for each race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman Restoration talent: Healing Way has been fixed (/nerfed) so that the HWay bonus from +healing is reduced by lower level heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
So my rank 1 HW do 100 now, instead of 400 free heal each second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can no longer use /mountspecial while in motion on a mount. <br />
<br />
/mountspecial now causes a druid bird to flip in the air, not sure if this was pre patch as well.<br />
<br />
/mountspecial used to cause any druid cat to stand straight on all four legs, now for the Night Elf Druid it has a roaring animation. The Tauren Druid still has the weird one.</div></div><hr />
