Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Paladin Armor Sets<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Paladin armor sets. <br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the plate Raid Finder armor set in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Racials<br />
Will Touch of the Grave have its output adjusted for WoD? Most other racials scale up with gear, TotG is less than 0.5% atm<br />
Yes, tuning is likely to be adjusted. However, that's a common misconception. Other stats don't scale like you think. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469196504628867072))<br />
They do increase in value, but not like most people think. 1% crit is nearly half as valuable at 75% crit than at 5%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469196817221967872))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
Why is the duration increase of Conductivity scaling negatively with haste not something that's been fixed yet?<br />
It doesn't scale negatively, it just doesn't scale positively. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468914449559326720))<br />
No - at 0% haste, it extends 4 seconds - at ~33% haste that drops to a 3 second extension<br />
It's X ticks that it adds. That stays constant. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/468936175521374208))<br />
<br />
With the 4/4 upgrades I just hit 100.06% mastery on my elemental shaman - Is everything above 100% just wasted now?<br />
Yes, 100% Elemental Overload is the hard cap. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469203763211669504))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
In WoD, if I decide to gear through Heroic Dungeons, will I be able to skip LFR and go straight to Normals?<br />
Yes. Gear from other sources may of course make it easier, but Normal Highmaul will be tuned for Heroic dungeon gear. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468915543601606656))<br />
I forget. Is Highmaul or Blackrock Foundry the entry raid like Mogu'shan Vaults?<br />
Highmaul is the first raid. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/468985978078904320))<br />
<br />
Can we get a deserter thing for Kicked Tanks from LFR? Tired of them running around acting like jerks and screaming Insta Queue.<br />
Now imagine a new tank who queues for LFR and gets kicked for not knowing a fight, and how Deserter on top of that would feel. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469243286809366530))<br />
Definitely not a good solution, but something should be done about people who just hide behind Instant Queue to torture a group.<br />
No argument from me there. Social issues like that are something we discuss a lot. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469253787001954304))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Why not just increase the damage taken by tank specs to 100%? Guardians will still be required by high rating teams.<br />
This isn't a roundabout way to exclude tanks from RBGs. Just felt their tuning hurt gameplay, so reigned it in a bit. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469164325119090688))<br />
<br />
Will tank specs have a place in arenas in 6.0? I missed being a protadin in 2's back in early cata. Hoping for a return!<br />
We'll be experimenting with some ideas in alpha. It may be necessary to say that tanks take extra damage in PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/469166791143354368))<br />
<br />
World<br />
I asked this way late last night but will Draenor be Cross Realmed like the world or will it be by itself like SW/Org/Pandaria?<br />
Like Pandaria works today, though you'll likely see some cross-server players that are in manually-formed groups. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/469172757901496320))<br />

That is a double healer group with the tank doing about 50% of the groups damage because they can cap vengance and keep it chained the whole time. It is a good concept but you you have to run with an insane tank and two healers that can do damage too, which that comp can.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of funny though, considering they didn't get Gold (2 enemies short when the last boss died). Lulz.</div></div><hr />

That's what they wanted. Now to get it you will be forced to take part in Mythic Raiding. <br />

Sorry I am kind of mad. I understand a different color but the best looking set shouldn't be limited to Mythic. I still have no clue what my guilds plans are but I know it isn't to fill a 20+ man raiding roster with extra people we are going to have to sit every week. Tough enough with 10.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to do it in a specific order you just have to finish all the criteria for finish the run...they got gold (and they were only 1 short when the boss died but not like it matters).</div></div><hr />

Leeds isn't a healer. If you look at the healing done its just the priest and the monk (tank) doing the majority of the healing.</div></div><hr />

How is white and blue a bad color scheme? I'm sure that's been in other tiers before too. I guess it depends on taste though.<br />

<br />
Sorry I am kind of mad. I understand a different color but the best looking set shouldn't be limited to Mythic. <br />
<br />
Sorry, but i'll have to politely I disagree here. I don't raid mythic/heroic, etc, and I am in no way a hardcore player, but I know those people are raiding the hardest difficulty which takes the most time and planning, so they deserve an awesome reward, especially in the form of impressive looking armor that's unique from the rest. It brings back those bragging rights in wow, and the feeling folks had in BC/classic when someone had an epic mount or a purple item. Both sets look cool, but people who raid Mythic have earned unique/exclusive armor, it shouldn't just be handed out like charity. That's how most games and many MMOs work now and in the past, not sure why it should be different with WoW.<br />
<br />
Hard work for a just reward. Not minimum work for a shiny because i want it now and i'm lazy. Blizzard needs to rid WoW's community of this &quot;gimme gimme gimme; now now now!&quot; mindset so the game doesn't get boring so fast when they throw in so many EZ-mode features. This is a step in the right direction imo.</div></div><hr />

It brings back those bragging rights in wow<br />
<br />
They don't deserve anything, you say the wow community is &quot;Gimme gimme gimme&quot; but that is just the vocal 1% who thinks they have the rights to everything in raiding period. News flash: They don't.<br />
<br />
The point behind raiding is because you enjoy it, not how many rewards you get from it to make you look better than other raiders. If your only purpose in raiding is to flaunt that you raid, you have serious problems.<br />
<br />
Try paying attention when a &quot;New mount&quot; appears, if it isn't attached to their tier of raiding, they rage and flame the mount. Calling it a waste of time that could have gone into ... oh I don't know, raiding content. Yet if that exact same mount was instead limited to those who only did the hardest level of raiding THEN it wouldn't be a waste. Lets forget the fact that it would truly be a waste for so few people to even HAVE the damned thing.<br />
<br />
Yeah sure, they are doing the hardest tier by choice, and that is what it should be, the choice to do it, not a carrot on a stick saying &quot;Hey do this difficulty so you get the cool factor of X reward. The only rewards that should come from raiding other than the gear, is an achievement at best, MAYBE a title.<br />
<br />
If we want to play the deserving game, the only ones who should get a reward at all are world first/server firsts and after that it should be removed so no else can have it, after all they bust their asses to get it done first over all others. Half these other &quot;raiding guilds&quot; barely get it done before its nerfed due to the next tier being released.<br />
<br />
Another thing that should be fixed are the ahead of the curve achievement, it should be fixed so you have to be in a guild group to earn it. Especially after the GM of a guild I know got angry their group sucked, and instead of trying to assemble a better group said eff it and OQ'd their way into ahead of the curve SoO.</div></div><hr />

I like some of the PvP models. I'll never get any of it because I have no plans to PvP. So should I QQ because I want it?<br />
<br />
Just like PvP, Mythic will have it's own set of gear. If you want it, make the time and find a guild and/or raid that are running it. If you can't make the time or don't want to leave your guild, etc. well too bad. This miniscule fraction of the game's content will be out of reach for you. Go and get some of the thousands of other items available to you.</div></div><hr />

The more effort you put into it, the higher the rewards should be, so this is quite logical to me. And I don't even do heroic raiding.<br />
<br />
It makes me want to put the extra effort into trying to clear it with my guild though, because who doesn't like unique gear? :)</div></div><hr />

It's kind of funny though, considering they didn't get Gold (2 enemies short when the last boss died). Lulz.<br />
<br />
No... they got gold... sigh do people even pay attention?<br />

They don't deserve anything, you say the wow community is &quot;Gimme gimme gimme&quot; but that is just the vocal 1% who thinks they have the rights to everything in raiding period. News flash: They don't.<br />
<br />
No you're wrong... hardcore raiders do deserve to have better ( or at least different I guess depending on taste) looking gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point behind raiding is because you enjoy it, not how many rewards you get from it to make you look better than other raiders. If your only purpose in raiding is to flaunt that you raid, you have serious problems.<br />
<br />
Try paying attention when a &quot;New mount&quot; appears, if it isn't attached to their tier of raiding, they rage and flame the mount. Calling it a waste of time that could have gone into ... oh I don't know, raiding content. Yet if that exact same mount was instead limited to those who only did the hardest level of raiding THEN it wouldn't be a waste. Lets forget the fact that it would truly be a waste for so few people to even HAVE the damned thing.<br />
<br />
Yeah sure, they are doing the hardest tier by choice, and that is what it should be, the choice to do it, not a carrot on a stick saying &quot;Hey do this difficulty so you get the cool factor of X reward. The only rewards that should come from raiding other than the gear, is an achievement at best, MAYBE a title.<br />
<br />
If we want to play the deserving game, the only ones who should get a reward at all are world first/server firsts and after that it should be removed so no else can have it, after all they bust their asses to get it done first over all others. Half these other &quot;raiding guilds&quot; barely get it done before its nerfed due to the next tier being released.<br />
<br />
Another thing that should be fixed are the ahead of the curve achievement, it should be fixed so you have to be in a guild group to earn it. Especially after the GM of a guild I know got angry their group sucked, and instead of trying to assemble a better group said eff it and OQ'd their way into ahead of the curve SoO.<br />
<br />
I don't think I have rights to everything. In fact, I don't have any rights to the LFR gear, just as LFR players have no rights to my raiding/heroic gear. Coolbeans?</div></div><hr />

<br />
About the shoulders.<br />
<br />
1. They are the most visible part from a distance together with the helmet - so they focus on the stuff you see best <br />
2. If you are in a sword fight the most likely part that gets hit is your head, shoulders and chest. So the knights armors protected these the most:<br />

Or you do it in a pug 1-2 tiers from now. Or solo it in an expansion or two. Mythic raiders get their cool gear while it's current content, other people get it later on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but i'll have to politely I disagree here. I don't raid mythic/heroic, etc, and I am in no way a hardcore player, but I know those people are raiding the hardest difficulty which takes the most time and planning, so they deserve an awesome reward, especially in the form of impressive looking armor that's unique from the rest. It brings back those bragging rights in wow, and the feeling folks had in BC/classic when someone had an epic mount or a purple item. Both sets look cool, but people who raid Mythic have earned unique/exclusive armor, it shouldn't just be handed out like charity. That's how most games and many MMOs work now and in the past, not sure why it should be different with WoW.<br />
<br />
Hard work for a just reward. Not minimum work for a shiny because i want it now and i'm lazy. Blizzard needs to rid WoW's community of this &quot;gimme gimme gimme; now now now!&quot; mindset so the game doesn't get boring so fast when they throw in so many EZ-mode features. This is a step in the right direction imo.<br />
<br />

Little bit of a hypocrit are we?<br />
<br />
This is one of the comments you made about LFR gear.<br />
<br />
LFR is like spectator mode. Reward high end blue gear equal to dungeon gear. That's all these LFR players really deserve.<br />
<br />
But ooooooh, when they reward something to players on a higher difficulty then you're able to get it's suddenly no fair. It works both ways, players doing mythic deserve the best looking gear, others don't.<br />
Not that I'm surprised these comments would start when it became clear mythic would be getting different sets.</div></div><hr />

I could but then I'm off-tanking and maining as fury. I have better things to do to respec left and right, well I could now because we stopped raiding 5 months ago, but then I unsubbed at that time too, until WoD. <br />
<br />
CMs are broken, in fact the whole stats lowering thing is broken, they need to find a better way to adjust the difficulty, especially when they make dumb itemization like they did in MoP and then the CMs take a complete shit on that, where some classes work by lowering their stats others get completely shafted - alas my Fury example, when you have a spec build around only amassing Crit to make the spec work, and then you take all that Crit away in CMs, you know your system is broken and should have been fixed about 1 month the expansion hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's.... a Paladin. A HOLY warrior. Should it be surprising that he would have holy symbols on him? <br />
<br />
Besides, if you're on about the top one the cross on the shoulders is just a standard cross, like a plus sign + . It's not the Christain Jesus Cross, maybe you should get /your/ eyes tested because clearly you're the only who can see it. <br />
<br />
Anyway, OT: I almost like the middle one, it'd be better without the hat, and if you removed the silly floaty things from the shoulders though. Top one looks pants, and the bottom one has a bad colour scheme going on for a Paladin. It's a very...pestulant and ill colour scheme, that colour scheme is more fitting of a Death Knight.</div></div><hr />
