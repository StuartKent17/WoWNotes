differences between lets say prydaz and your bis legendary are still very minimal, not to mention that prydaz has other useful factors like stayin alive in m15+<br />
<br />
theres this problem however that a bunch of people only look at sims and see that X item does Y more damage, ergo every other legendary is totally useless</div></div><hr />

That is actually a fault of the person transcribing the Q&amp;A. Ion was saying the exact opposite and that internal data matters less than player perception because if people think a class/spec is bad, that is what will actually negatively impacts you.</div></div><hr />

Doubling down on the randomness of legendary loot is sickening. Nobody like random legendaries. It is not fun or cool. It's a cheap way of dangling that moldy carrot so that blizz can wring as much MAU statistics from players as possible. This approach may result in some short term profitability but it's going to hurt long term. Players will eventually get fed up and when they leave it will be for good.<br />
<br />
I usually take breaks from WoW and come back with new content, my next break is going to be permanent. The current RNG and legendary system are a disgusting parlor trick to give the illusion of content when in reality it's just blizz trying to tap into gambling addiction to make a cheap buck.</div></div><hr />

Most would disagree with you. Randomness is not fun or rewarding. Grinding the same WQ every day is not fun. Timegated content is not fun. Many enjoy alts but this is the most alt unfriendly xpac ever. Good luck trying to switch mains this expansion because if you don't have bis legendaries on your alt then you're dead weight.</div></div><hr />

These may have another purpose later on. So the one thing that could've slightly un-fucked the legendary system is being squandered until you have all your legendary's...what the literal fuck...<br />
<br />
<br />
Randomness has always been at the core of World of Warcraft. It has been part of most games, going back to pen and paper games. I played the old pen and paper games, the rng factor was a whole lot less. Legion RNG is on a whole 'nother bloody level.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team does want to preserve some sense of reward. If you aren't having fun doing content, you should take a break. You shouldn't feel the need to go back and do something that you don't enjoy. Translation from lawyer-esse &quot;quit, we don't care&quot;. I do agree with it though. Might not have to wait till Blizzcon announcements to go on hiatus after all. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you feel like there are too many Prestige levels and you can never reach what you want on your main, pushing you to only play your main, that is a problem. It's been an issue and brought up for months now. Maybe in the following expansion after the next one, they might actually do something about it...<br />
<br />
Sorry for sounding bitter, it just amazes me at this point how much he just continues to suck what little fun is out of the game and is perfectly alright with it. Instead of actually saying &quot;our bad&quot; and try to improve things. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Vanilla and TBC with all their wonders were shit in that regard... But you surely main a rogue or a mage so you don't give a fuck about other people. There were a lot of specs that weren't even viable, you weren't invited to a fucking dungeon if you weren't a Holy Paladin, a Resto Shaman/Druid, etc...<br />
<br />
Fuck that mentality. I love my Ret, my Spriest, my WW monk, there's nothing more boring than a class than can only do dps. The typical salty of a main Lock/Rogue/Mage on hybrids doing great damage as well should never be listened.<br />
<br />
By having 3 DPS specs you have the advantage on at least ONE (most of the time two) specs really high on the metters so you are always viable. Fuck us the only DPS spec we have and we're doomed to bench or playing a role we only enjoy outside raiding. That's all the upperhand you need, to always be viable with one of your specs, not doing more damage than hybrids who only have one, some two dps specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was playing a prot paladin and worked very hard to earn a spot! Also you said &quot;there's nothing more boring than a class than can only do dps&quot;. Grats I agree, thats why I am asking for TBC classes, because there were support classes back then, every class had something else to do despite DPS... SPriest the mana battery of healers, Mages the CC, Paladin the aoe tank, Shaman the buffer, Warlock could tank demons and provided group DPS with CoE.. this was the era where you were not felt boring because you just did DPS...<br />
<br />
Now it doesnt matter if you are a Retri paladin or a shadow priest or elemental shaman... you can just remove your class name and just show us your DPS meter..<br />
<br />

<br />
Are you sure you played on TBC? Because you keep talking about DPS like it was the only thing that did matter... Priest had 1 DPS spec and we didnt bring him for his DPS capability... or you were in the worst guild ever?</div></div><hr />

<br />
On an alt paladin, im ilvl 917, with not bis legendaries and im pulling 1m+ dps sustained. So yeah, you are dead wrong. 1m+ is enough to start clearing stuff in mythic tomb.<br />

I get the frustration of getting bad legendaries, but for most people given the content they are doing it doesn't really matter. <br />
<br />
I'd say this. I'd rather have access to a lot of potential sources for upgrades over things like 40 man raids dropping 2 piece of loot as was the case in some of the Vanilla raids, iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is a lie. A decision was made before they started building it, that there would be no flying. Why lie, Ion? Just say it - post release zones won't include flying. Just fucking say it. Now there will be expectations of flying in new zones in the future, when you damned well know you're not going to design for it. You haven't for 3 expansions now.

Also you said &quot;there's nothing more boring than a class than can only do dps&quot;. Grats I agree, thats why I am asking for TBC classes, because there were support classes back then, every class had something else to do despite DPS... SPriest the mana battery of priests, Mages the CC, Paladin the aoe tank, Shaman the buffer, Warlock could tank demons and provided group DPS with CoE.. this was the era where you were not felt boring because you just did DPS...<br />
<br />
Now it doesnt matter if you are a Retri paladin or a shadow priest or elemental shaman... you can just remove your class name and just show us your DPS meter..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you sure you played on TBC? Because you keep talking about DPS like it was the only thing that did matter... Priest had 1 DPS spec and we didnt bring him for his DPS capability... or you were in the worst guild ever?<br />
<br />
I played TBC and forced to play Holy because Ret dps were shit (it was towards Sunwell that started to scale really nice with Seal of Blood). TBC wasn't too extreme like vanilla but still there were severe disregard towards many specs. Spriest survive the cut because of its passive healing which added to spiritual attunement gave the holy paladins eternal mana. Which was something that was really broken thus fixed in Wotlk giving SA only to prot Paladins and nerfing Illumination. I'm too old to remember the Vampiric Embrace changes over time.<br />
<br />
Wotlk was a fine place I would say, even when a lot of class uniqueness were loss with the shared buffs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Damage it's what kills the bosses and will always be what matters the most. I don't want to live in that world again when I wasn't able to play my favourite spec to do the content I want to do which is the highest difficult raiding.</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is a lie. A decision was made before they started building it, that there would be no flying. Why lie, Ion? Just say it - post release zones won't include flying. Just fucking say it.

<br />
Honestly, Retri Paladin might have been the only spec that did &quot;suffer&quot; in TBC. Still I remember bringing 1 retri paladin for the extra buff that did matter a lot. Yes damage is what kills the boss, but in a raid group, tota ldamage matters more than personal damage. If that was the case, all TBC guilds would just stack rogues for the most damage but they didnt. <br />
<br />
I agree that you didnt had a total freedom.. if you just cared for DPS and you did want to play shadow priest for example, you were feeling that you dont do much. I got it that not all people care about support classes.. I personally love support classes. I want to know I help the group to increase the potential, by either CC, buff or debuff the enemy.<br />
<br />
The 3% spell crit and spell Hit from Elemental shaman was a very good boost for the raid, as it was the windfury totem from Enh. It didnt need to be top damage. There were also very interesting raid compositions, you couldnt go and raid with anything... <br />
<br />
Anyway, thats personal taste I guess... I will always favor unique classes vs &quot;jack of all trades&quot;.</div></div><hr />

No, I stand the opposite, I can bring utility without doing low damage. I love to top the metters (without tunneling) as Ret because we always run from behind other classes, it's a great feeling for me. But no, I would probably quit the game if that old system is back because I would have no place in a cutting edge aiming guild.<br />
<br />
You can have distinct classes and diverse utility without guttering damage. Since raid buffs are a thing of the past they have to come up with something new.<br />
<br />
My main role was and always be a melee dps, it's what brings me the greatest enjoy in the game. And while I have and really enjoy my rogue, there's no way I'm rerolling to it, it's not as niche and spectacular as the Ret paladin was always to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say this. I'd rather have access to a lot of potential sources for upgrades over things like 40 man raids dropping 2 piece of loot as was the case in some of the Vanilla raids, iirc.<br />
Sure, you can have solid dps w/o your bis legs, but on my frost DK, the chest alone is worth about 10% total dps, and it's one of the two I'm still missing, so I can't help but feel gimped ...<br />
<br />
If the legendary balance was really good, and all were within 20% of each other, he'd have a point. As it is, some legs are head and shoulders above the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also personally I kind of agree with him on the rng situation, outside of legendaries I don't really think titanforging is a massive issue, perhaps it should be slightly limited to not have extreme cases and to prevent old raid items from continuing to be bis but it is nice that as someone who's mostly full mythic geared I can run a heroic and get lucky and get an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is that if DPS is the only thing that matters there will always be specs on top and always be specs on bottom... what if in the next patch your Retri Paladin goes to bottom of the logs? Imagine if your best class was warlock, how would you feel this expansion... On the other hand, if you chose a class based on the utility / support it brings to the group, you will never feel neglected. <br />
<br />
You want Tank/DPS/Healer.. I want Single target tank/ AoE tank/ DPS / Debuffer / CC / Buffer / Tank healer / Raid Healer :P <br />
<br />
I am not saying I am right and you are wrong, just my preference.. honestly I dont see wow go back to old design / mechanics, so you have not to worry about it :P The only thing you ll have to worry is that Paladin wont be the Legion Warlock on next expansion...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yeah i guess for every lucker who gets the best 2 legendaries as his first 2 there's a looser who gets them as his last 2, so the average looks ok.

<br />
Does damage have to be the only thing that matters as far as balance goes?<br />
<br />
<br />
They know the answer to this already though, or at least have some idea with the sayings in Class Utility and Mythic Dungeons:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be great if classes could bring unique things rather than the team copying someone a class has and giving it to another class.<br />
<br />
There are a few things removed in initial Legion pruning that could come back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if DK wasn't doing Arcane Mage type damage in Mythic HFC, Gorefiend's Grasp was still useful. Windwalkers exceled at 3 target cleave but guilds were more reluctant to bring a Rogue for Mythic Xhul'horac for soaking, despite the Rogue barely having time to dps. This is honestly deja vu:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Various classes bring various abilities that provide utility to parties and raids. We talked about one type of utility in the Buffs and Debuffs section, above. However, there are other types of raid utility, and it’s been in need of more attention. In general, raid utility, especially raid-wide defensive cooldowns, had grown too strong. So many classes and specializations had defensive cooldowns that we had to make raid damage extremely high, as raids would be stacking or chaining together multiple cooldowns. We'd like to return to a system where it's the healers who heal through the scary moments, not the damage dealers, for example. (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/15682579)<br />
<br />
Rather than too strong utility vs weak, it's no utility vs some. So yes, Utility does play a part, and so does defensives as we can see w/ MDI's lack of Shamans.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There will always be a spec at the top of the list and a spec at the bottom of the list, so everyone will never be happy if that is the only metric.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought that was made clear with WoD. However, let's say Spec A is good at AoE &amp; Spec B is good at AoE, ST, and Cleave - some specs are designed around a niche that others are easily fulfilling; feeling gimped to be good at one thing that another can easily do, and more, doesn't feel good.</div></div><hr />

Random distribution of legendary items statement directly contradicts the Progression statement made just before. People are forced to farm to get their legendaries.<br />
<br />
And to try to claim that a utility legendary is just as good as a non-utility legendary is simply disingenuous.<br />
<br />
Yeah for me the &quot;Progression is one of the main parts of the game. It is less exciting when you are killing a boss on farm over and over and there is zero chance that you could get something that is an upgrade&quot; part is sickening. If this was true, then WoW raiding wouldn't have been popular at all until WoD, lol. BiS lists were there for this exact reason...</div></div><hr />

Yep haha! The funny thing is, if I wanted to pop all my CDs at the start of every encounter, I could pull around 1m dps as holy for the first 20-40 seconds of the fight, especially if hero is popped at the start, but usually I like to save my CDs for when actual damage happens and i need to heal the raid.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Holy can do some insane burst despite it only having Holy Shock, Judgement and Crusader Strike.<br />

<br />
If the legendary balance was really good, and all were within 20% of each other, he'd have a point. As it is, some legs are head and shoulders above the rest.<br />
<br />
But the point is, you dont need any legendary to do ANYTHING in this game. A mythic raid of 20 people with NO legendary items could still down bosses there.<br />
<br />
Think of them as purely BONUS to your normal damage output. If the community just treated them this way, then there would be no outcry and no whining.<br />

This whole thing is pretty offtopic, but you're underestimating mythic bosses very nonchalantly. You can die to enrage timers as soon as Harjatan if your dps is low. 1 million dps doesn't cut it for most of mythic ToS unless you're being carried. 1 million dps Ret pally is basically a gray parse (https://www.warcraftlogs.com/statistics/13/#dataset=25&amp;aggregate=amount&amp;boss=2032) on Mythic Goroth.</div></div><hr />

Imagine if your best class was warlock, how would you feel this expansion... On the other hand, if you chose a class based on the utility / support it brings to the group, you will never feel neglected. <br />
<br />
You want Tank/DPS/Healer.. I want Single target tank/ AoE tank/ DPS / Debuffer / CC / Buffer / Tank healer / Raid Healer :P <br />
<br />
I am not saying I am right and you are wrong, just my preference.. honestly I dont see wow go back to old design / mechanics, so you have not to worry about it :P The only thing you ll have to worry is that Paladin wont be the Legion Warlock on next expansion...<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock is doing fine. Every class does it fine. If you are good with your class you can get into a core these days, perhaps not a realm first aspiring guild but to a guild aiming with no rush to cutting edge. <br />
<br />
The only spec that was really abyssal in dps was Unholy in Nighthold, poor things, it was a disaster. I'm glad they kinda fixed them.<br />
<br />
The three lock in my guild are main locks since ever hence they're very good and far above average with the class and do very nice dps, specially single target. Perhaps a more mundane lock is having trouble. But at high end I even saw many guilds having at least one lock within the kill roster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ret has never been in a desirable position, you'll never find a guild that says &quot;oh nice a ret&quot;. I earn my spots always by being best than most. By experience, talent, discipline (I never miss a raid, when I can't raid whatever the reason I take a break from the game), and working my ass hard since wotlk when I could finally raid as Ret.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Random distribution of legendary items statement directly contradicts the Progression statement made just before. People are forced to farm to get their legendaries.<br />
<br />
And to try to claim that a utility legendary is just as good as a non-utility legendary is simply disingenuous.<br />
<br />
You are (no surprise) misunderstanding what he is saying. The problem is NOT that the items are random. The problem is that every legendary is not equal, and this problem was even worse in the past. <br />
I expect they are doing their best to rectify this in whatever the system turns in to, but the solution is not to just make it so you can pick the two legendaries you want then never care about the system again. That is not good game design and frankly, as is, this system keeps people doing content they never would have cared about before.</div></div><hr />

He says the legendary RNG is not the problem. The problem is that legendaries are not equal in desirability. <br />
If you disagree with this, you are just being short sighted. If you were this worried, you wouldn't be playing, as every single item in a dungeon or raid operates this way.<br />

It is very very easy! make the classes unique again and drop down the stupid &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; that homogenized all classes... thats why only the biggest bar matter now.. you made it so. It wasnt the case in Vanilla and TBC<br />
<br />
Yet if you go back to those expansions now you see people spec shame people like fuck. The problem is not the game, its the community. In reality, the solution is to give every class the same options as every other class, but only be allowed to take certain options with talents etc. <br />
IE give everyone shroud of concealment, blood lust, battle rez etc, but only be able to pick so many utilities. <br />
That's true balance, and if you believe the leaks likely coming as a part of the new shared specs discussed.<br />

I do agree with that, but its impossible to fix without allowing players to select what legendary they want. Either remove their effects, which would make them just another item with higher ilevel or make legendaries selectable. There is no way to make legendaries equally desirable.<br />
<br />
However that's not my biggest concern. I'm mostly concerned about warforged/titanforged, paragon. Ion is happy with current levels of RNG and endless grind it creates. Its here to stay.</div></div><hr />

As it should be. I made a video on this topic about 2 weeks ago, but these systems are the reason Legion has insane playability and the reason the game's activity is growing. Is a bit scummy because a lot of people are only playing because if they don't they will fall behind, but still the smartest decision Blizzard has made.<br />
The fix for legendaries is a tough thing to come to, but with how quickly you can get them now, the only real problem is alts. <br />
Anyone who is having a problem with legendaries at this point is not playing the game enough to have an opinion on it.</div></div><hr />

Homogenization 101... like we dont already have homogenized classes... the solution is to make class really unique, with strengths and weaknesses, like all normal RPG games... people will always shame other people, either for spec or for skill or for damage meters... you cant fight that.</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is a lie. A decision was made before they started building it, that there would be no flying. Why lie, Ion? Just say it - post release zones won't include flying. Just fucking say it. Now there will be expectations of flying in new zones in the future, when you damned well know you're not going to design for it. You haven't for 3 expansions now. You couldn't in MOP and the Timeless Isle, you couldn't in WOD, and now Legion. It's your intent - fucking stand by it. This was a lame ass statement, and it's GOING to bite you in the ass next expansion.<br />

There won't be flying on Argus, because of how the environment is built. It is incompatible with flying.<br />
Generally there is a zone in an expansion that never allows flying.<br />
This isn't setting a precedent for future zones post-release, it just has to do with how Argus was built.<br />

Please, everyone, just think about this a little before reiterating Ion's garbage.<br />
The Game Director - the person who is responsible for the design of Argus - tells us we can't fly in Argus &quot;because it wasn't designed for it&quot; and NO ONE bats an eyelid? Isn't the logical follow up question, &quot;Why the #$% did you not design it for flying?!?&quot;<br />

Not only do we not get a firm commitment to never pull this crap again (i.e. flying for only 4 months of a 2 year expansion), nor do we get an apology, but instead we get ANOTHER &quot;well we MIGHT not do it again so please keep subscribed and to see how we can screw you over with these weasel words next time&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Its clear design that blizzard has used before under different lead devs. There is nothing new in designing zones to be no-fly zones. Its pretty clear why argus is no fly zone. Its three zones that are not physically connected to each other. It makes alot more sense than all the other no fly zones.<br />

If you actually listen to the QA that's exactly what he's saying. That the teams were too focused on pruning based on keybind space and overall ability numbers and that they should have focused more on moment to moment decision making and utility.<br />
<br />
He said he would like it if every class had some unique and valuable utility that they brought to a dungeon or raid, so that rather than homogenized classes by sharing the same utilities, they just always had their own opportunity to shine in every dungeon.</div></div><hr />

The team doesn't want you to go back and do old raids only for the hope of a legendary item.<br />

What a gem, I think two thirds (or more) of my legendaries are from zerging EN/ToV/NH<br />
<br />
<br />
Random distribution of legendary items isn't a problem. There is something cool about not having the ability to choose a specific legendary from a list. Each person may have a different legendary, but those should be good in some different situations.<br />
<br />
Sure, let's ask some rogues/demonhunters/warriors/etc. how they feel about their &quot;should be good&quot; legendaries for example.</div></div><hr />

Well when I have 6500+ attempts at a world boss mount then I am very inclined to agree that constantly losing feels very unsatisfying.<br />
<br />
Also, to further add, their argument for why Krokuun and Mac'aree are not account-wide in world quests is stupid. &quot;Oh the story and lore is going to seem weird&quot;. Well I did it once on a character, therefore I understand where and what is going on in the story in regards to world quests. <br />

Adding a 6th piece to sets gave players room for legendary items, but players can instead use a 4pc bonus, 2pc bonus from another set, and 2 legendary items.<br />

because why design zone with 3 axis when you can design it with 2 cut cost and then play a &quot; tomato&quot; with playerbase pretending its anything but milking the f.... out of $$$$ from them<br />
<br />
I don't even think it's about the 3rd axis. It's more that you would have to design areas where you can fly much bigger than those where you can't fly. Bigger = more expensive. That's actually the only true reason for this no-flight discussion. A dev must have brought that up in one of their meetings: &quot;Dudes, if we didn't allow flight, we wouldn't have to design these huge areas, small areas with as many obstacles (gorges, mountains, water bodies that force longer ways) would feel just as big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then of course these cost-savings convinced everyone else and there it was, the new-born &quot;flying is evil&quot; mantra.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. This is nothing more than cost savings. As if they don't already copy-paste many things, but no. <br />

Have you seen the movie &quot;Inception&quot;? There is a scene where the protagonist Cobb enlists a dream architect (Ariadne, what a great name) for his team. He sets her a task to draw a labyrinth in 1 minute, which would take a person 2 minutes to solve. This is what zone design in WoW is all about lately. Put in as little time as you can and blow things up so we will waste much more time with going through the place.<br />

Um, you just described exactly what an MMORPG is. If anything WoW is becoming more and more LIKE one than UNLIKE one. RNG is a staple of these games, it creates replay value. The execution is what's poor, don't blame the RNG.<br />
<br />
Well, RNG in an RPG is not that extreme. If we are talking slot machines, then yes, but then we just should be rolling dice then pretending that we play an RPG.<br />

After all the heavy criticism of the saturation of RNG in Legion, Ion's response is complete dismissal; adding &quot;It's fun and exciting!&quot; -- go suck a dick you fucking dead-eyed trout!! <br />

Bet this asshole hasn't even played the game at all this expansion.<br />

I think his salary should become random. Give him 10% as baseline, and roll each month if he gets a random upgrade. Maybe 0,1% chance to titanforge to 200%. Then we will talk again.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's how the world works. Either cut costs (become more efficient) or increase revenue (e.g., increase price).

Well, given the size of the game you have to admit that we've seen almost anything being used somewhere already. The maze argument is nonsense; you can do the new content just as fast as the old. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
What's the alternative? Linear progression along a predictable farm path? As a proud owner of a pre-nerf Winterspring Frostsaber, I hope that will never happen again. <br />
<br />
RNG with bad luck protection is the most addictive incentive system discovered so far. It won't go anywhere. The problem is that it's working too well. Players are getting addicted to the unexpected moments of great happiness, playing in a constant state of anticipation. Just like in gambling, however, it doesn't make people happy in the long run. <br />
<br />
To get real here for a moment - I strongly think that games which use these mechanics should be looked at much closer by the respective national authorities because they implement insights on psychology from the gambling industry into a framework with no external supervision.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think his salary should become random. Give him 10% as baseline, and roll each month if he gets a random upgrade. Maybe 0,1% chance to titanforge to 200%. Then we will talk again.<br />
<br />
You should implement this analogy correctly. For every hour he works he gets the minimum wage.* In addition to that, he gets to roll once after each our worked for a random bonus between zero and a million dollars, with the mean of this random salary distribution being the difference between the minimum wage and his current hourly wage.** <br />
<br />
// edit: <br />
<br />
At the extensive margin, there are two exteme outcomes. Either he gets lucky early and can spend a lot of time with his family (his first legendary is BiS) or he doesn't and he'll work for barely nothing. However, he'll can always be hopeful that the future will get better. Scale this up to a working population and you'll get a few lucky people who work very little and still become rich while others work all of their life and still end up with nothing. For every individual the system looks fair and promising, but in the aggregate it produces a great amount of inequality and disappointment.<br />
<br />
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the legendary system in its current state. :cool:<br />
<br />
<br />
*This makes sure that he constantly progresses in terms of his income, but on the very minimal trajectory. I guarantees a reward for your time, so that you get something in return even if you're unlucky.<br />
<br />
**This distribution would be highly skewed. Bad luck protection could be easily built in by requiring at least every 8th payout to be above average, which would make sure that he's getting a positive surprise at least once per day. While it seems that you have a chance to get that million dollars, you might die before that actually happens. It also means that you will, on average, earn just about as much money at the end of the year as you would have on a regular payment system. However, you'll live in the constant hope that you win a million dollars, which motivates you to get more chances to win in, which means you will want to work more. Furthermore, due to the shape of the distribution you'll end up being constantly disappointed, because you will see more payouts below the mean compared to the relatively few large payout above it that compensate them in total value. It's a brutal treadmill that plays to your hopes while keeping you enganged, but unhappy.</div></div><hr />

Watcher has no clue what so ever. It's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I only glossed over it. But yeah I agree with you. Some of the things they say about legendaries and RNG just frustrates me a little.<br />
<br />
Random distribution of legendary items isn't a problem. There is something cool about not having the ability to choose a specific legendary from a list. Each person may have a different legendary, but those should be good in some different situations.<br />
<br />
Uh no. Being able to target or choose a specific legendary is way more fun that getting Prydaz as your first on 3 characters.</div></div><hr />

Yes, randomness has always been a factor in this game, but they don't seem to understand that having THIS EFFING MANY (wf/tf, crucible, Legendaries, etc) RNGs AT ONCE is just not helping the game. AT ALL. It's just lovely how they keep ignoring all these feedback.</div></div><hr />

I wholly applaud the updating and understand it takes time, but i cannot understand the Warlock priorities this expansion. I am not one who is usually typing this out, but the evidence is right there in terms of priority. Demonology was gutted (actually appropriate use of the word for once) to created DHs and left in a half-complete state that was never expanded on after their numbers looked okay, no matter how clunky the gameplay, and Destro only recently makes more sense after the design was reverted. So i was incredibly disappointed on behalf of our warlocks that the visual updates also just happened, I'm sure, to end up either at the tail end or in the next expansion.<br />

I think you get confused..I never said I can do 1m sustained dps in mythic raid ST in 917 with retri pala and without bis legendaries...but those logs are from good players...bloody good ones and even them can pull out with bis or close to bis legendaries...(plus probably they are boosted by guild....so good chance they can ignore lot of mechanics)<br />

That has to be a joke. I'm not surprised they wouldn't change it, but come on. Randomness does not make something cool just because it's random. Especially when you've been getting every legendary except the BiS one for your spec since launch.</div></div><hr />

The problem is not the game, its the community.

IE give everyone shroud of concealment, blood lust, battle rez etc, but only be able to pick so many utilities. <br />

Dampen Harm now reduces all damage you take by 20% to 50% for 10 seconds, based on the size of the attack, with a 2 minute cooldown.<br />

Breath of Fire range and width have been increased.<br />
<br />

Brew-Stache now lasts 4.5 seconds (was 1.5).<br />

<br />
Gift of the Mists’ maximum bonus is now 75% (was 60%).<br />
<br />
<br />
New talent: Mystic Vitality<br />
Stagger is now 40% more effective against magical attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Brewmaster) Fundamental Observation: Zen Meditation is no longer cancelled when you move or when you are hit by a melee attack, and reduces the cooldown of Zen Meditation by 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Brewmaster) Firestone Walkers: Now reduces Fortifying Brew’s cooldown by 2 seconds (was 1 second) per enemy hit, up to a maximum of 6 seconds (was 4 seconds).<br />

EN/ToV, BrM was the worst Tank; lack of Magic Mitigation in Magic heavy environments. A patch later, and those seemingly &quot;coincidental&quot; buffs, they are one of the best Tanks with Guardian. Same thing happened again in ToS (increased sources for Mastery, more armor, max uptime of a trait, tank buffs, etc).

Its clear design that blizzard has used before under different lead devs. There is nothing new in designing zones to be no-fly zones. Its pretty clear why argus is no fly zone. Its three zones that are not physically connected to each other. It makes alot more sense than all the other no fly zones.<br />
<br />
You do realise that you live in your own delusional world where you make up stuff to justify your hate towards Ion. I would seriously consider you to change to some other game. This is clearly not mentally healthy for you.<br />
<br />
Oh good grief. Not this nonsense again. There are 2 main differences in these zones:<br />
1) They all came out in expansions were where there was no 8-month time gated path finder, that has resulted in flying in relevant content happening for only 4 months or so in the 24 month lifecycle of the expansion (16%) (and note - you could only fly in broken chore, AFTER you completed it, so even that metric is generous)<br />
and<br />
2) In expansions of old, with the partial exception of Isle of Thunder, the majority of stuff to do occurred in flying enabled content. You needed fish for your raid that night? You fished in a flight enabled area. You needed to herbs for potions/flasks? You flew from node to node. Needed valor points for gear? LFR/dungeons or daily quests - most were in flight enabled areas. Pet battles? Archaeology? Rare spawns? Yup - all flying enabled areas. Heck - even the raid entrances were usually in flying enabled zones. Argus changed that. They made new mats exclusive to Argus. Professions are an RNG nightmare best not bothered with, and all possible sources of gearing are funneled to Argus by a ilv bump and removing the old ones from Broken Shore. For combat centric areas, I can tolerate no flying (you have to be on the ground to kill stuff anyways), but when all relevant world content is forced into a no-flying area, that's when there's a problem.<br />
<br />
I don't really care if people fly on Argus. I care about the design philosophy that let Ion think this was ever a good idea. The reason he gave for HIS design choice is God damn aesthetics - not game play. According to his &quot;official&quot; stance, we are to have flying after we mastered the content, yet that philosophy was brushed aside because a damn skybox would look better from the ground. (Yes, this makes no sense what-so-ever, and probably is a lie, but is the official current stance on the subject). The result is that not being able to remove flight in WoD, they essentially removed it in Legion via the back door this way by delaying flight for as long as possible and then right away OBSOLETING the current expac in favor of the new no fly zone in the very next patch after flight.<br />
<br />
And yes, Ion, has pissed me off enough in his continued ruination of the game I love (with things like ilv scaling, flying, and CRZ in current content), that I have let my sub lapse - quite possibly indefinitely. I keep up on the news in the hopes that things will change, but I'm not hopeful. That doesn't mean that I forgive the guy personally for driving me away from a hobby I used to love and drowned WAY too much time into, so, no - I don't like him.</div></div><hr />

People who have almost all legendaries are not super lucky, they have been playing since the launch of Legion and stuck with their main character throughout. Blizzard is rewarding people who worked hard with bonus legendaries for alts. Not to mention 10 legendaries in two months is amazing, some of us didn't get our first legendary until 2 months into legion. Your post comes off as very naive to anyone that has been playing Legion for awhile.</div></div><hr />

If you were smart and actually looked nh came out mid January so &quot;ages&quot; ago is like 9 months ago. *snip* see that mythic progression at the start of the expansion<br />
<br />
You're...You're kind of a fucking moron, dude. First of all, you're touting you do 1.1mil dps on harjatan heroic...yet somehow are able to pull those same numbers on single target bosses without the massive padding you're doing on adds? Dudebro That's mathematically not possible unless they changed divinestorm to split its damage on all targets hit, which they didn't. Now, a more realistic number is about 900k on single target, which is respectable for ToS, but ToS wasn't balanced around netherlight crucible. without the crucible, I imagine your damage would be closer to 700-800k, which any hardcore guild would likely bench without a second thought.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know what the state of retribution pallies is, I don't play one - but for the classes I do play, the difference between the BiS legendaries and the mediocre ones is night and day. For most classes, their BiS legendaries do one of two things: A substantial boost to their spec's performance(Be it dps, healing, or tanking), or it significantly improves their kit to be a whole hell of a lot easier than it'd be without. Things like prydaz are certainly respectable, but the prydaz has only been good for a little less than half the expansion. Now that it's a massive stat-stick it's all around a solid choice regardless of spec, but that isn't the benchmark of mediocrity. There are a lot more mediocre to downright horrible legendaries that's niche is so small it's pretty much garbage in 99% of circumstances. Odr, Shawl of the Ymirjar(A destro legendary) comes to mind, here.<br />
<br />
But really, people don't give a shit about the rng of legendaries, we're used to it. What people want is to be 100% raid ready come the final raid of the expansion, and not be mindlessly grinding rares and chests in a zone they can navigate like the back of their hand by now. I downloaded a mod called &quot;Legendary Progress Tracker&quot; to find out exactly how much effort I'm putting in to get a legendary. Over the course of a week since my last legendary, I had killed over 400 argus rares, collected over 100 argus chests, completed over 60 invasions, and only after doing that RELIGIOUSLY did I get a legendary(Thankfully out of the handful I have left to get, with my top 2 legendaries being my BiS, I got one of my BiS the other day). I think overall my points added up to just under 700, and blizzard expects you to do that for every damn legendary, even the ones you don't want and will never, ever use.<br />
<br />
That's the thing, isn't it? You grind out for a legendary and due to the plethora of less-than-ideal legendaries, you'll get dicked more often than not. People are tired of hammering away at LFR, rares, and chests. We're so deep into the expansion that we're burnt out and rather than fix existing problems, it's just gotten worse(Crucible), then a glimmer of hope arrives in the form of legendary tokens and surprise! &quot;You need to collect all your class's legendaries, then you can roll the dice on some other character you will never have geared in time for the next progression cycle&quot;<br />
<br />
Listen, I get that you're a retribution pally, and you're essentially second-in-line to hunters when it comes to being autistic, and I might sound harsh, but it's really out of love. Break free from your class stereotype... Or at the very least, don't try to create a mathematical paradox that will rip open space time, sucking our entire planet into limbo and killing us all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Link your armory please. I only ask because I want to see your experience with raiding or if your just talking out your ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally right:<br />
<br />
In WoW, if you try to apply to groups and are declined because the community thinks your spec is weak, it impacts your gameplay experience, even if the spec is capable of doing well.<br />
<br />
Totally wrong:<br />
<br />
There will always be a spec at the top of the list and a spec at the bottom of the list, so everyone will never be happy if that is the only metric.</div></div><hr />

Most of the work needed to allow new realm connections is now done! The team tested with some BR servers, found some issues, and fixed them. They are now talking about which realms to connect.<br />
<br />
yes yes yes yes yes!!! Finally!!! Hopefully they connect Hellfire / Arathor EU to something decent , that way it might actually feel like an MMO again...As I recall the last realm connections were in 2013. I'm surprised they are revisiting this. Pleased but surprised. Does anyone have a link of any sites that will be following this? The last I have is here: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Connected_Realms</div></div><hr />

I don't really play anything but my warrior. It'd be nice if they just increased drop rates for Legos substantially.</div></div><hr />

I hope it is soon, im currently on a WoW break purely cause it doesn't feel MMO ish unless i hit LFG or LFR etc, not seeing people around etc while questing, kinda sucks.<br />
<br />
Runescape has more of an MMORPG feel to it atm haha, maybe cause it is a 2k world cap and mostly all worlds are half full etc at peak times of the day, see lots of people running around etc. Don't really see that on my realm atm even in SWind or Dalaran.. Barely see any1 questing (WQs aswell). Game feels dead atm, can't wait till this happens unless they merge it with another dead realm, and then the merges will die just like the old ones did, the last merge did nothing on my realm :/.<br />
<br />
with how it is dying realm pop recently, Maybe they should revert the cap on the realms, a &quot;medium pop&quot; realm is now classed as low, so even if u click on a low realm if your new, you could be just getting put on a realm that is 10000% dead.. :/. Either that or news on realms on how populated they are, not just &quot;low, medium, high&quot;</div></div><hr />

I played my rogue for 8 months straight and have a 3 other 110's I played sometimes (I played all of the expansion except for 2 months). I switched to my warrior as my main the past month. Yes it did take me about a month and a half to get my first one. Getting 10 legendary in 2 months goes to the lucky people. Not I.</div></div><hr />
