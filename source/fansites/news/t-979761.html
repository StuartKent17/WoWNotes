Patch 4.3 Interview with Greg Street (Ghostcrawler)<br />
Below is a quick summary and the full thanks to Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca). Be sure to read it so that you don't miss anything! (Extra info via Joystiq (http://www.joystiq.com/2011/09/19/blizzard-talks-about-patch-4-3-and-the-future-of-world-of-warcra/), Eurogamer (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-09-19-killing-deathwing-in-wow-patch-4-3-interview), TenTonHammer (http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/174675/page/1?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss), and Tankspot (http://www.tankspot.com/showthread.php?77571-Interview-with-Greg-Street-AKA-Ghostcrawler))<br />
<br />
Deathwing Raid<br />
<br />
The new raid is called The Dragon Soul. It contains eight bosses, and boss 7 and 8 are both Deathwing.<br />
There will be a mount reward for killing Deathwing.<br />
Deathwing will only drop weapons.<br />
Heroic Deathwing will eventually be made easier after the top guilds kill it so that more people can experience it.<br />
Tier 13 will not be available at all from valor points.<br />
The new legendaries are two daggers (main hand and offhand) that are only usable by all three Rogue specs. Combat Rogues will be made to use these daggers as well without a DPS loss. The questline will revolve around the pure black dragon (from the egg in the Badlands) and features several Rogue-centric elements.<br />
Melee classes will be getting a buff that is only active in the new raid to help them compete with ranged classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Five Man Heroics<br />
<br />
You will enter the new 5-mans and raid in Caverns of Time.<br />
The first new 5-man is called &quot;Endtime&quot; where Nozdormu will show players the future if Deathwing wins. <br />
The second new 5-man, &quot;Well of Eternity&quot; is a journey into the past, the War of the Ancients specifically, to help Thrall recover the Dragon Soul to use against Deathwing. <br />
The third new 5-man, called &quot;Hour of Twilight&quot;, has players escorting Thrall in present day to Wyrmrest Temple, where the final battle against Deathwing will take place. <br />
<br />
<br />
Looking for Raid<br />
<br />
Looking for Raid probably won't share a lockout with Normal and Heroic raids.<br />
Looking for Raid gear will be stronger than the new five man heroics, but weaker than normal raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other<br />
<br />
There will be raid melee buff across the board. The attack power buff will apply more to melee attack power than ranged attack power.<br />
Tank rotation changes that are related to survivability won't be in this expansion.<br />
Epic gems will drop in the new raid in Normal and Heroic only. Each player gets a geode when a boss is killed which has a small chance to contain an epic gem, most will have rare gems. It is rare enough to take all of 4.3 to replace all of your red rare quality gems with red epic gems.<br />
Firelands was nerfed so that players could see the content and continue progression instead of hitting a wall in heroic modes.<br />
&quot;Quite a few&quot; new profession recipes will be added.<br />
Northrend will require 2/3rd of the experience it does now, making leveling alts faster.<br />
Corrupted Ashbringer won't be available for transmogrification from any vendor.<br />
Old PvP armor will come back for transmogrification.<br />
<br />

Deathwing Raid - Warlord Zonozz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
Ghostcrawler: The focus of our 4.3 patch is the heroes’ final battle against Deathwing the dragon. There will be an epic raid where 10 and 25 player groups can try to defeat Deathwing. In addition, we have three 5 player dungeons to kind of set the stage; it will be kind of similar to the way the dungeons in the Icecrown patch lead up to the final conflict against the Lich King. We have a new legendary weapon that players will be able to get in the raid. We have a Raid Finder system that will work a lot like Dungeon Finder to allow more casual raiders to get into the content. And we have a couple of character customization features we’ve talked about already: Transmogrification which lets you change the look of your armor and Void Storage which gives you a place to store it all. And then finally we have an update to the Darkmoon Faire - an entire island full of fun carnival games.<br />
<br />
Will the new Looking for Raid difficulty share a lockout with Normal and Heroic raids?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We’re not entirely sure yet because we’re still working out the details. Our goal is that it doesn’t. We want people to be able to do the raid with their group and then still do Looking for Raid, maybe on the weekends or when their guild isn’t available.<br />
<br />
Do you feel like you are alienating any part of the player base when you make easier content or do you think the new three difficulty system might solve that?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We’re hoping it solves it. I mean, generally this is an experiment for us. We’re not sure how it is going to work out. We have a hugely diverse player base, and we want to be able to let lots of different players see the content. We felt in the past we were struggling too much to decide “Okay, heroic mode is for 5% of the population… that means normal mode has to be for 95% of the raiding population” and we were stretching ourselves really thin. So our hope is that by offering up an additional difficulty, it will free up normal mode to be targeted towards the kind of traditional guild it has been, where players who don’t have a lot of time to raid or find the commitment too much can do Raid Finder to be able to experience the fights.<br />
<br />
While the game may continue to go strongly for a long time, do you think WoW may have hit its peak subscription number at all?<br />
Ghostcrawler: I mean, gosh, that is so hard to know. It’s really hard to tell what is… you know it’s a seven-year-old game at this point. We don’t have really any examples of games that have remained so popular for so long to really know what the future might bring. We certainly understand that some players have just gotten their fill of World of Warcraft, and the kind of things we would have to do to provide really interesting new features for them risks changing World of Warcraft into something else. We have to be really careful not to overhaul the game so dramatically that people who love the game fall out of love with it. At the same time, it is a rough economy going on, summers are always a little light, and periods between expansions are always a little light, so we’ll see how things look after another expansion or two.<br />
<br />
So when Cataclysm came about, there were a lot of changes to the healing model. Do you think that it has been successful and will you insure its stability in the next raid set?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Yes, we’ve really liked the way the healing model has worked out. It had some hiccups along the way where I think players just starting out going into dungeons, particularly the heroic dungeons, felt like they just didn’t have the mana to do anything. That was probably a little too extreme. We’ve gotten to the point now where most raid geared healers feel like they have the mana to do what they want, but they still can’t completely waste it. A Discipline Priest that does nothing but Power Word: Shield is going to find they’re going to have to do something quickly to get their mana back or they’ll have to risk not having enough for the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
So another thing that came with Cataclysm, well even in other expansions, was that some fights favored some types of DPS that led to some classes being kind of sat out on certain encounters. Do you think that in the Deathwing fight this might happen as well or are you trying to balance that?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We try to keep in mind, I mean on one hand we really want to encourage all available players to play. It’s tough not to go in and try to change things when you find that someone is too weak on a fight and a more competitive guild risks sitting that player out. We really don’t like that, but at the same time if we aren’t careful then the fights will all kind of feel the same because we’ll have to say “Okay, where’s the AE moment so that my Demonology Warlock can shine and where is the movement component of this fight because that is really good for my Fire Mage” or whatever. So we kind of give… it’s hard enough coming up with new encounters where players don’t immediately say “Oh, you’ve done that already; we’ve seen it all before”. We make so many hundreds of bosses that we like to give our encounter designers a lot of room to maneuver.<br />
<br />
It becomes a problem when it feels like consistently the same types of characters aren’t competing. We’ve seen a lot of concern about the melee classes just can’t compete with the ranged classes. Part of that is class mechanics; part of it is that we just have a lot of encounters that really favor ranged. So for the Deathwing tier, what we’re going to do is just a straight up buff to the melee classes that hopefully helps them a little bit. We’re going to do that in such a way that the raid buffs will just end up buffing melee a little more than they’ll buff ranged. So hopefully you won’t have a lot of widespread effects in PvP or things like that, but melee characters who are just stabbing away on a boss in optimal situations will feel like their DPS is very competitive.<br />
<br />
Can you talk a little bit about the new legendary for this patch?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Sure. It is a pair of daggers – a main-hand and an off-hand dagger. We are designing them such that all three Rogue specs will be able to use it. We have a little tweak in there so that Combat Rogues will be able to Sinister Strike with the daggers without it being a big DPS loss.<br />
<br />
The story of these legendary daggers has to do with the last remaining pure black dragon egg. So kind of how we got here is the black dragons are a really cool enemy in our universe, they have been for a while, but we’re kind of killing them off a lot. Onyxia has been killed and brought back so many times that we’re starting to feel bad for the old girl. Nefarian is dead, again, and Deathwing is going down. So we thought we were running out of black dragons, and we really didn’t want to do that because they’re a really great enemy and we really want to use them again in the future.<br />
<br />
So players who play through the Cataclysm quests in the Badlands will remember a questline around this uncorrupted black dragon egg. It was free of the taint of the Old Gods. So what is going to happen is that black dragon egg eventually hatches and there is a black dragon prince who is pure – he’s not a minion of Deathwing; he’s not corrupted by the Old Gods. But that doesn’t mean he is necessarily a good guy. He’s kind of out for himself, he’s kind of got his own agenda, and to bring his plans to fruition he contacts the Rogue because Rogues are a little shady, always working in the shadows, always playing a number of games and has other things going on. The black dragon prince reaches out to the Rogue character and says “If you help me out, I’ll reward you with these increasingly more powerful daggers”.<br />
<br />
How did the team decide to make a Rogue weapon rather than a tanking weapon for this legendary?<br />
Ghostcrawler: It’s really funny because every player out there wants and almost expects the next legendary is going to be for them. We try not to let it fall into too much of a pattern. We want legendaries to be something exciting, something that is earned, not something that you “deserve” because it is “your time to get one”. We thought that we liked part of the Rogue story. We thought that Rogues had maybe felt a little bit not special in this expansion with all the high damage numbers that were being done by classes like Mages. We thought it was just the right opportunity to make them shine and feel kind of special. Unless you count the bow, we haven’t done any class specific legendaries to this extent before, so we thought it would be fun to make the legendary quest VERY Rogue-themed. There will be stealthing and pickpocketing, things we know that a Rogue can handle. Then, the weapons themselves, their proc, we’re still building, but the idea is that their proc will tie in something very Rogue specific as well.<br />
<br />
One of the problems with tanking weapons is that our tanks use very different weapons so we could say “Well this legendary weapon is going to be for the Warrior and Paladin and hopefully we’ll get to the Death Knight and Druid someday in the future”. With all the talk about a legendary weapon that transforms “you could have a 2-handed version or a 1-handed version”, too much of that I think starts to suck away what is really special about the legendary when it can turn into all these different things.<br />
<br />
I guess the message to the players is don’t despair and don’t assume that you’ll never get a legendary for your guy. Hopefully we’ll eventually get them all, but we don’t want to keep it on such a timetable that players are able to predict “Okay, the Elemental Shaman legendary is coming in Patch 6.2 followed by the Hunter crossbow”.<br />
<br />
How do you feel the Dungeon Journal worked out and how will you be releasing the information in it this time around?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We’re really happy with the feature overall. I know that it is a lot to ask the players to go research a fight completely before the first time they see it, but we really like the way you can link spells in your raid chat or something and say “Okay, I want you to handle this” and maybe when somebody doesn’t understand a mechanic very well you can explain it a little better that way. Like all of our features it will evolve over time but we’re pretty happy with how it turned out.<br />
<br />
I know there was some concern amongst the most hardcore raiders that they didn’t want the surprise spoiled for them and they kind of wanted to do discover things on their own. Maybe in the future we won’t reveal all the mechanics on heroic, but that is something we’ll have to evaluate.<br />
<br />
What achievements will be granted in the new Looking for Raid system and are they similar to existing ones or any new rewards?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We are very concerned about preserving the sense of accomplishment for the Normal and Heroic tier. We don’t want to over reward Looking for Raid. It is really there for people who want to see the content and want to feel like they’re raiding, but we don’t want it to be more attractive than traditional organized raiding.<br />
<br />
We will offer some achievements; they’ll be very simple, nothing like you’ll be able to get in a Normal or Heroic. For example, it might just be “Kill the first four bosses” as one achievement and “Kill the second four bosses” as another achievement, something like that. We won’t, for example, put the legendary in the Looking for Raid tier. We are doing epic gems this time around as a drop in the raid and we may not have those drop in the Looking for Raid tier.<br />
<br />
Where does the gear fit in terms of the new 5-mans? Will they be like ZA and ZG were or will they be a bit lower… where will they fit?<br />
Ghostcrawler: A little bit higher… we’re still debating the exact numbers but I think they’re probably slotting it maybe between Normal Firelands and Heroic Firelands. It will be slightly weaker than the Looking for Raid tier and obviously weaker than the remaining Deathwing raid tier.<br />
<br />
And what about Looking for Raid gear… how powerful will it be?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Yeah, like I said, it should be slightly above the 5-player dungeon gear but not as powerful as the normal raid. The Deathwing raid is called The Dragon Soul; it should be weaker than The Dragon Soul tier.<br />
<br />
Will the new Darkmoon Faire update change anything to Insane in the Membrane?<br />
Ghostcrawler: No, I don’t believe so. I think our plans for Insane in the Membrane in the future are to try in the future sometime to offer a brutally difficult achievement or Feat of Strength for players who are looking for it. But it makes us nervous to go mess with that one too much because some players were able to do it when it was really hard and we don’t want to risk making it easier or making it even harder or that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
What kind of abilities does Deathwing have in his encounter and why doesn’t he just breathe fire on us?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Oh, the encounter is really, really cool. First of all, it is split into two fights, so boss seven is Deathwing and then boss eight is also Deathwing.<br />
<br />
In fight seven, you parachute off of a gunship onto Deathwing’s back as he’s flying from Dragonblight towards the Maelstrom. You have pry these armor plates off of his back and fight off the corrupted blood that comes out. All the while, Deathwing himself is trying to shake you off his back and he’s going to do barrel rolls and things like that to try to dislodge you like the little parasite you are because he is so big.<br />
<br />
The final Deathwing fight is really amazing. He crashes into the Maelstrom and then he kind of emerges out of it again. And he’s so big; he’s taking up this whole area. The players hop around from the little islands in the Maelstrom. So on the first little island they might be fighting one of his tentacles, and then they have to fly to the next island and now they’re fighting a leg and then they fly to the next island and they’re fighting another big tentacle. All the while the dragon aspects, Alexstrasza and Ysera and Nozdormu, are flying around and they’re also helping the raid in this fight. So Alexstrasza might breathe fire at an important moment or Nozdormu might stop time. They’re not helping you at random. There is a little bit of strategy as to how you use their abilities too, so they’re not just background, it’s actually a pretty critical mechanic of beating the fight.<br />
<br />
Transmogrification question, when you transfer the appearance of something that is enchanted with say, Mongoose, will that effect go over?<br />
Ghostcrawler: No, the enchants won’t go over. You’ll have to enchant the weapon the same way you would a non-transmogrified weapon.<br />
<br />
Right now leveling and gearing up alts takes a significant amount of time and investment. Are there any improvements coming in this area?<br />
Ghostcrawler: In 4.3, we’re actually increasing the leveling rate of Northrend pretty dramatically. We’re dropping the time it takes by a third. The players should notice that. Long-term we recognize that we definitely are going to have a problem at some point. If World of Warcraft’s character level is like 120 someday, it is asking an awful lot of players to hurry through all of that to get to the endgame if that is what they are interested in. We’re taking about various mechanics we might eventually do to help out with that, but in the short-term, just increase leveling rate in Northrend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rinoa</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am kind of gutted that the two last tiers of Cataclysm only have/will have one raid in them though. I'd very much like to see at least 2 raids per tier.<br />
<br />
Edit: The final Deathwing fight is really amazing. He crashes into the Maelstrom and then he kind of emerges out of it again. And he’s so big; he’s taking up this whole area. The players hop around from the little islands in the Maelstrom. So on the first little island they might be fighting one of his tentacles, and then they have to fly to the next island and now they’re fighting a leg and then they fly to the next island and they’re fighting another big tentacle. All the while the dragon aspects, Alexstrasza and Ysera and Nozdormu, are flying around and they’re also helping the raid in this fight. So Alexstrasza might breathe fire at an important moment or Nozdormu might stop time. They’re not helping you at random. There is a little bit of strategy as to how you use their abilities too, so they’re not just background, it’s actually a pretty critical mechanic of beating the fight.<br />

The Dragon Soul raid has 7/8 bosses. To my personal exeperience this is rather low. Firelands was on 7 and you can do it easly in 3 hours. Blizzard want raiders to use LFR and LFG more??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigcountry11782</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How did the team decide to make a Rogue weapon rather than a tanking weapon for this legendary? Ghostcrawler: It’s really funny because every player out there wants and almost expects the next legendary is going to be for them. We try not to let it fall into too much of a pattern. We want legendaries to be something exciting, something that is earned, not something that you “deserve” because it is “your time to get one”. We thought that we liked part of the Rogue story. We thought that Rogues had maybe felt a little bit not special in this expansion with all the high damage numbers that were being done by classes like Mages. We thought it was just the right opportunity to make them shine and feel kind of special. Unless you count the bow, we haven’t done any class specific legendaries to this extent before, so we thought it would be fun to make the legendary quest VERY Rogue-themed. There will be stealthing and pickpocketing, things we know that a Rogue can handle. Then, the weapons themselves, their proc, we’re still building, but the idea is that their proc will tie in something very Rogue specific as well. One of the problems with tanking weapons is that our tanks use very different weapons so we could say “Well this legendary weapon is going to be for the Warrior and Paladin and hopefully we’ll get to the Death Knight and Druid someday in the future”. With all the talk about a legendary weapon that transforms “you could have a 2-handed version or a 1-handed version”, too much of that I think starts to suck away what is really special about the legendary when it can turn into all these different things. I guess the message to the players is don’t despair and don’t assume that you’ll never get a legendary for your guy. Hopefully we’ll eventually get them all, but we don’t want to keep it on such a timetable that players are able to predict “Okay, the Elemental Shaman legendary is coming in Patch 6.2 followed by the Hunter crossbow”.<br />
he acts like the rogue has never got a legendary before hmm WAR GLAVES ;o oh ya and if i remember the legendary bow from sun well was bis for them hmm</div></div><hr />

Yes, of course, we do understand there should be no pattern to legendaries, but for * sake, there are some classes that must be completely epxelled form the queue because of sheer numbers of legendaries they've already had. The number 1 of them is definitely rogue. Giving them yet another new legendary is like spitting in the face of all the other classes that havent had one yet. Especially feral which never had anything legendary available.. Or both the shield-wearing classes.. So, the rogues didnt feel good because of mages high dps you say so you had to toss them a bone?

They said 6 bosses and then Deathwing. And Deathwing is supposed to be 3+ encounters (loot in between each phase). So thats about 9 or more bosses. Depending on how many phases DW has.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Okay apparently 7 and 8 are DW. Thats different from the Joystick article. But the 9th is probably an optional heroic boss!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if it relates to things like how melee are forced to fight in the front during certain fights. In some of the encounters, the bosses have a buff/debuff that also makes it so they cannot parry. Without that, it's a DPS loss for us to be in front like that. There are also some fights with a decent amount of boss movement in them that become a pain for melee. Boss movement is the #1 reason why I hate the Ascendant Council fight in BoT.... It's such a frustrating fight when you feel like you're spending way too much time not smackin' stuff with your weapon(s)!</div></div><hr />

QFT - Not at all excited about the prospect of gems only dropping in raids. Why the hell did I level a jewelcrafter if I can't actually jewelcraft on her &gt;.&lt; I'm really hoping that was only part of it, and that they will in fact be prospectable from pyrite ore as well, or hell even available via VP or something.</div></div><hr />

Rather than fix the numbers and tweak the classes to actually bring rogues THEMSELVES to a competitive level, they say fuck it, let's take the easy way out and hand them a meter stick (as in DPS meter, mind).<br />

Rather than tweak the encounters so that melee and ranged can both perform where they need to be, they saw fuck it, just make the encounter ranged-friendly, and toss melee a 10k DPS lead right off the bat so they can contribute to the raid.<br />

You know that's pretty funny, because I thought the easy way to buff rogues would be to just buff any of their passive spec bonuses or throw a huge mastery buff at them. But you're totally right, designing a quest chain and a legendary item from scratch sounds way way easier than that. .../sarcasm off</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means: &quot;Hello. Melee DPS cannot compete with Ranged DPS in PvE, but it's the reverse in PvP and we can't figure out how to reconcile the two, beyond a stupid bandaid buff in the final raid teir.... because we would rather have DPS unbalanced in PvE than in PvP because ARENAS/TOURNAMENTS/PROGAMING.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's true for a lot of 10 mans, class specific is a short sighted design in a game where they also create 10 man raids. if you look at stat right now like 80% of raiding guilds are 10 man now, how many of them don't have a rogue? this move is going to upset a lot. some will just be the &quot;QQ i didn't get it this patcH&quot; but that's not the large concern really, get over it.<br />
<br />
But i do feel the argument of your 10 man not having a rogue at all is a valid one. you can't just assume every 10 man comp is magically gonna be 1 of each of the 10 classes. and if blizz goes down this road, and say next time it is a druid legendary, or warrior or something, it's always gonna screw over the 10 mans, every time. but i guess blizz has to make the mistake to learn from it, instead of putting out the forethought. wait 6 months then they will go &quot;i guess in afterthought that was pretty dumb and narrowminded thing to do to 10 mans&quot;.<br />
<br />
oh well.</div></div><hr />

I think it's funny how you think it's good design to give a class a fancy looking weapon in order to convince players to play said class.<br />
<br />
It not only contradicts their philosophy on compelling gameplay by saying &quot;ohai we know we can't design rogues as a fun class, so here's a shiny orange weapon for ya!&quot;, but like everyone has already said, they straight reneged on their word to not design legendaries for a single class.

<br />
So those people leveling the rogue go and get the daggers from a guild which has no rogues and as the next expansion comes and the new legendary comes (which is obviously for warriors, retribution paladins and DK's because Blizzard hates Feral's and Enhancements in the legendarybusiness) they change their character again because they are just hunting for legendarys.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the patch itself sounds really cool and I am really looking forward to the raid. Gotta admit though that I am a bit disappointed as they decided not to make War of The Ancients a raid instance.</div></div><hr />

14 players, 0 rogues. All right, we have a owrthless legendary to never bother with. The REAL issue I have is that our moron warrior tank who is already a lazy turd will quit tanking, make the DK who hates tanking tank, then force his PvP rogue who he probably can't raid with into the raid so he can get the legendary once we have certain bosses on farm.<br />
<br />
They talk about bringing the player not the class? This ruins that worse than anything before. Scrubs will reroll bad rogues and bitch and moan to raid with them for the sweet orange weapons.<br />
<br />
I guess 70% of the guild aren't even able to obtain the legendary dagger, so who cares?</div></div><hr />

It was BIS for rogue's at the time so yes they could use the hunter's bow at the time but hunters could not use the Warglaive's at the time. Poor Poor Rogue' sad that mage's had good dps so here you go dagger's feel better now?</div></div><hr />

I suspect the class feedbacks for development ideas for the next xpac so hopefully they can address some of the obvious imbalances between melee and ranged there.<br />
Also why wasn't the legendary a 1h axe with a agi and str version? Would have made considerably more sense as rogues could have used it, wars as SMF, dks and enhance shammies keeping everyone happy but they decided to take the decision that I expect will likely alienate people even further.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goobaman</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, true enough, although I don't really see how it's hard to predict what effect certain buffs would have on damage, at least in PvE. Obviously they're more concerned with PvP. They should just scrap arena and balancing classes would be easy as pie.<br />
<br />
I could not agree more. It feels like the more they preach about balance, the WORSE balance seems to get. I realize this is just a game, but they are full of shit when they stick to things they can quantify as reasons for nerfs and such, and just pull shit out of their asses for other things.<br />
<br />
For example, I can totally get behind their reasoning behind the nerfs. They had x% of players they hoped to see through at least normal, and possibly a y% through heroics. Those %s did not pan out, so they adjust difficulty to meet said quota. That makes logical sense to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought that Rogues had maybe felt a little bit not special in this expansion with all the high damage numbers that were being done by classes like Mages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me? Notice here how they reference a specific class. This statement has NOTHING to do with the legendary staff, because if that were so, they could have reference all the caster classes, so I wanna just get that out of the way. This is directly referencing a class with one of the top 3 damage specs in PVE so we're talking straight numbers. This is exactly saying &quot;We can't figure out how to bring Rogues up to par, so lets just toss out a fancy meter stick and call it day.&quot; <br />
It's pathetic and deplorable.</div></div><hr />

I'd very much like to see at least 2 raids per tier.<br />
<br />
I agree. $40, same as Wrath. Wrath offered 10 levels, Naxx, Ulduar, OS, RS, Ony, Maly, ToC, 4-boss Vault, ICC, and a good chunk of dungeons to do. 3 raid tiers, plus 6 sub-tier raids. 9 raids total.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm offered 5 levels, a broken LFD finder that essentially pigeonholed you into 2 dungeons unless you wanted to do twice the work for valor, what MIGHT be a 3-boss BH, Tot4W, BoT, BWD, FL, DW raid, and DW 5-mans, same as ICC got. 3 raid tiers, plus 3 extra raids (I consider BoT and Throne extra just because they were smaller raids, while calling BWD the MAIN tier raid for the sake of numbers). 6 raids total. Also an ending world event.<br />
<br />
I don't get where the hell their planning went. There were talks of more smaller content patches, yet Wrath was the one to have the mini-raid events like OS, Maly, Ony, and RS. I like what Cata offered, but when you put it up against what was expected, it's somewhat of a big failure.</div></div><hr />

Not that I mind rogues getting a legendary at all really (I don't play one for the record), but it just seems rather counter productive to make the legendary of a final raiding tier a single class only. You'd think they would want to include perhaps Enh shaman (I mean you ARE assisting Thrall throughout the majority of the quest lines in the patch) or ferals in some way.<br />
<br />
The 5 mans do sound pretty interesting though. Just hope they don't burn out as fast as the ZA/ZG ones did.</div></div><hr />

I think I have all of like 4 stacks in my bank - I'm honestly just annoyed that they way it sounds gems are only obtainable through raiding, which is something I rarely do. I have a jewelcrafter and three alchemists, it would be nice to be able to transmute gems and actually cut gems on this toons that have a maxed level profession and should be able to. Not to mention if this does end up being the only way gems are available it's going to completely skew the market. Have fun paying insane prices for gems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's the point for the legendary. make rogues more popular. most raiding guilds I see rogues are pvp and not needed for raids, or for some reason they simply don't raid as much. when a guild can say &quot;but we don't have any rogues in our raid, we don't even have rogues in our guild!&quot; worse if the raid is 25 man and has no rogues. you know the class is being neglected by players. its understandable that players would rather play a ranged in firelands, especially mage or hunter. a lot of the rogue mechanics were also being neglected by blizzard, such as lockpicking, disarm traps, pickpocketing, and stealth in pve.<br />
<br />
I've noticed blizzard likes to aim for balance if possible, so if one class, which should be 1/10 of the population, makes up 30% of the population, that seems to be a problem. why not support a less played class and make it popular again, in an effort towards equality. it doesn't make sense to me that rogues are neglected by players for whatever reason, and therefore should be neglected by designers. in that case why not just remove the class if not going to fix it, mostly popularity and playability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, not that I think it's a big deal, I was just saying I agree with the person I quoted and said that I don't like how this might start causing people to QQ rushed alts into raids for the daggers.<br />
<br />
I'm fine if they want a narrow area of use for a legendary--that's its purpose. What I don't like is going out on a limb and giving it to possibly the least-played DPS class for raiding in the game, since it could result in a flooding of bad rogues, which will suck for those who have to put up with it.<br />
<br />
My guess is rogues weren't good enoguh to people in this tier, so they grabbed alts (probably legendary caster alts), and now they'll go back for the new orange.<br />
<br />
I'm a hunter. I wish a new hunter legendary was out. I wasn't with WoW when whatever it was dropped, but at the end of the day, it doesn't bother me much. Having a legendary will just mean people say you suck and your DPS is all legendary-based, not skill-based. Also, it's not like I can't play my role just fine with what the raids drop for me otherwise. LEgendaries are neat and all, but at the end of the day, they get replaced within 6 months and are just bank fodder and fond memories, so screw the bellyaching.<br />
<br />
I just hope we don't lose a tank becauase this fruit wants to force us to carry his rogue.</div></div><hr />

It was free of the taint of the Old Gods. So what is going to happen is that black dragon egg eventually hatches and there is a black dragon prince who is pure – he’s not a minion of Deathwing; he’s not corrupted by the Old Gods. But that doesn’t mean he is necessarily a good guy. He’s kind of out for himself, he’s kind of got his own agenda, and to bring his plans to fruition he contacts the Rogue because Rogues are a little shady, always working in the shadows, always playing a number of games and has other things going on. The black dragon prince reaches out to the Rogue character and says “If you help me out, I’ll reward you with these increasingly more powerful daggers”.<br />

<br />
I agree that the end result is likely that. But what the hell good is it when all the game becomes is, &quot;rotate your DPS to whichever class has the legendary?&quot; It's not a matter of making the class better or fun. It's people want more legendaries, so they class hop with alts and play it out for a patch or two until the next legendary arrives. It's not going to make rogues a better class. They'll be tossed aside when the next DPS legendary comes out, if that's what it is.<br />
<br />
They SHOULD focus more on making the SPEC better. Most classes have a certain spec, no? I'd say 75%+ of raiding hunters are MM. Would making a hunter legendary that boosts pets so BM is more popular fix it? No, becuase in a couple of months, it'll be back to sucking at DPS because the CLASS is broken.<br />
<br />
An OP weapon for the class is just a stall tactic so they don't have to fix the REAL issues until the next expansion, if they even do it then. In fact, I wonder if that's the whole reason rogues are getting a specific legendary--to give them an OP weapon to make up for Blizzard's laziness and unwillingness to fix the class in a proper manner.</div></div><hr />

To be fair I would say that *most* 10 man guilds carry 2 melee dps (we only have 1), which means that a lot of melee classes won't be represented in those raids, not just rogues. It's little comfort for any melee to be represented in a raid by a tank/healer/ranged of their class, and competition for melee spots in raids is fairly harsh - and I would tentatively put forth rogues were not the worst class in terms of dps or utility this expansion to fill those spaces as it stood. However, it is what it is and grats to the rogues I suppose :)</div></div><hr />

No, they'll just buff Sinister Strike to &quot;An instant strike that causes 200 damage in addition to 100% of your normal weapon damage ((100 * 1.45)% if a dagger is equipped).&quot; just like they did with Hemorrhage and Ambush.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It not only contradicts their philosophy on compelling gameplay by saying &quot;ohai we know we can't design rogues as a fun class, so here's a shiny orange weapon for ya!&quot;, but like everyone has already said, they straight reneged on their word to not design legendaries for a single class. Good show Blizz! You could probably achieve your goal of losing subs by just like randomly dc'ing players for the next few months til 4.3.<br />
<br />
owait...<br />
Good job misreading a very simple post. Part of the reason there's a rogue only legendary coming up is because they are currently underpresented in PvE, while not being underpowered and in need of a significant buff and, knowing Blizzard, they don't want to make big changes mid-expansion, so they try to amend rogues' problems temporarily by giving them a legendary, and all melees in general by giving them a buff in PvE raids (thus not giving them an unneeded buff in PvP).<br />
That said, I never said I thought it was good design, but it is clearly Blizzard's intention. I am not a Blizzard employee.<br />
<br />
Lastly, as far as I know, they've always said legendaries will be for a select few number of classes, and not the other way around; making a legendary for one specific class is not far from that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZenX</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the end result is likely that. But what the hell good is it when all the game becomes is, &quot;rotate your DPS to whichever class has the legendary?&quot; It's not a matter of making the class better or fun. It's people want more legendaries, so they class hop with alts and play it out for a patch or two until the next legendary arrives. It's not going to make rogues a better class. They'll be tossed aside when the next DPS legendary comes out, if that's what it is.<br />
<br />
They SHOULD focus more on making the SPEC better. Most classes have a certain spec, no? I'd say 75%+ of raiding hunters are MM. Would making a hunter legendary that boosts pets so BM is more popular fix it? No, becuase in a couple of months, it'll be back to sucking at DPS because the CLASS is broken.<br />
<br />
An OP weapon for the class is just a stall tactic so they don't have to fix the REAL issues until the next expansion, if they even do it then. In fact, I wonder if that's the whole reason rogues are getting a specific legendary--to give them an OP weapon to make up for Blizzard's laziness and unwillingness to fix the class in a proper manner.<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly. I don't even want to talk about a further imbalanced PvP, in the end it really ties to Blizzard beginning to neglect the games on behalf of their other projects(In past I wouldn't have really supported this idea, but seeing the flow of the game nowadays I'm beginning to)...<br />
<br />
A class-exclusive legendary is a terrible design flow, it would have been nicer if it would have been available to Hunters aswell such as two daggers can be changed into a bow to make it nicer, they've made Atiesh pickable with class, why not this? <br />
<br />
Rogues may not be represented well in PvE, however, they are in PvP to the point of 30% of PvP players consisting of them, yet, it is not because guilds have a hate for them to not recruit them, its because they chose not to raid, hence don't take part it PvE...<br />
<br />
...and from the looks of story of the dungeon we'll be the ones create the infinite dragonflight as the reason for us to send us back to help/recover such items will lead to great parodoxes...<br />
<br />
Now I'm waiting for my tier looks, in addition, if I get the idea that Blizzard is still neglecting my class(which they are terms of class balance, which there is no balance as its either gib or get gibbed), I'll help them to fix it, how? One more less DK, one more less people needing a fix, in their way or erasing the class, rather them forcing into the lore(means I will quit not reroll)...<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Its good that you are trying new things Blizzard, so will we in the future(it will be new in the sense that there will be no Blizzard in it)...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard isn't their grandma and patch 4.3 isn't an Xmas present. Grateful for something they are paying premium money for? Seriously? As paying customers, they can whine as much they'd like.

<br />
Rogue legendary. Rogues had atleast two decent legendary's (starsfury and twinblades and e.v.t Thunderfury). Why add a third?<br />
3 new dungeons in CoT sounds great, but are there alot players going to do those while there is a new Looking for Raid tool with beter drops?<br />
The Dragon Soul raid has 7/8 bosses. To my personal exeperience this is rather low. Firelands was on 7 and you can do it easly in 3 hours. Blizzard want raiders to use LFR and LFG more??<br />
<br />
However I think this will be a great patch and might raise the subs back a bit! <br />
GJ Blizzard (so far)<br />
likely LFR will still have the the week long lockout for the raid done with in it.<br />
or possibly you will only be able to get loot from a boss once a week within it.</div></div><hr />

Sure they revamped old content, but with a 7 year old game, the majority of the player base, a) didn't care because they focus on max level, b) didn't notice because when they level alts they ignore quest texts and just kill the stuff needed to get the xp to get to max level, or c) hated the revamped early levels because they like PvP and there wasn't even a smidgen of balance til max level. <br />

There you go. Make sure to apply common sense when you look, lest you come back telling me the &quot;legendaries&quot; used during Kael actually count.

<br />
Calling the 3000+ quests and revamped/remodeled old world content is completely ignoring what most WoW players play for...end game content.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see your objective statistics proving the bolded parts please. I know, personally, I read all the new quests and enjoyed the lore.<br />
<br />
See, the problem with taking your OPINION and presenting it as fact is that it fails this easily.<br />
<br />
My only argument was that from an objectively numbers-based point of view, Cataclysm has more content than any other Expansion. Disregard 3000 quests all you want, they're still all new. This whole 'Zomg it's revamped' nonsense is just a red herring people use to bash something that is just not true.<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah 3000+ quests is nice when you only have to complete like 250 to reach level 60. And sorry but doing all those quests at lvl 85 is just even more boring.<br />
<br />
The fail of this post is astounding.</div></div><hr />

He crashes into the Maelstrom and then he kind of emerges out of it again. And he’s so big; he’s taking up this whole area. The players hop around from the little islands in the Maelstrom. So on the first little island they might be fighting one of his tentacles, and then they have to fly to the next island and now they’re fighting a leg and then they fly to the next island and they’re fighting another big tentacle. All the while the dragon aspects, Alexstrasza and Ysera and Nozdormu, are flying around and they’re also helping the raid in this fight. So Alexstrasza might breathe fire at an important moment or Nozdormu might stop time. They’re not helping you at random. There is a little bit of strategy as to how you use their abilities too, so they’re not just background, it’s actually a pretty critical mechanic of beating the fight.<br />

<br />
So Deathwing is so big that we need to fight with hes body parts.. <br />
But Deathwing don`t have eny tentacle.....</div></div><hr />

It just makes no sense to start on a class specific Legendaries. <br />
<br />
And while they have complained about how much dev time it takes to create class specific quests while leveling and at endgame, how are the classes that can never have a class specific quest line in future expansions supposed to deal with other classes getting class specific quest chains with Legendaries attached to them.</div></div><hr />

Not that I mind rogues getting a legendary at all really (I don't play one for the record), but it just seems rather counter productive to make the legendary of a final raiding tier a single class only. You'd think they would want to include perhaps Enh shaman (I mean you ARE assisting Thrall throughout the majority of the quest lines in the patch) or ferals in some way.<br />
<br />
The 5 mans do sound pretty interesting though. Just hope they don't burn out as fast as the ZA/ZG ones did.<br />
<br />
So much for not wasting precious resources on class specific quests. In this case, this one is arguably a bigger waste than the lower level class quests because not everyone will be able to do this.</div></div><hr />

Holy priests too are very bad, get those 2 specs on par with the others, and it'll be fine.<br />
<br />
I noticed how he worded it, raid geared healers are OK. They know in fact that until you get gear your going to have a helluva time. In other words, just like every other stupid move they make they try to fix it with gear instead of admitting their new idea just sucked. <br />
<br />
I was really hoping for movement on this area because we lost the majority of our people over healing changes. When the healers went many too friends with them and it gutted the guild sufficiently many of us had no choice but move to one of the new consolidated guilds.</div></div><hr />

I liked in LK how they had GDKPs but that's a thing of the past now. So LF Raid that mode is definitely keeping me into the game....im not about being hardcore anymore or being elite geared and so forth.....just wanna see raid content besides heroic dungeons to mix it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Now if they added something new for Tol Barad life would be perfect!:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nosferato</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see now...<br />
here's a list of legendary items that were designed for use by certain classes at that period of current content, There will be some QQ about paladins and thunderfury but it was normal to see paladins running around with brutality blade... they DID have a spec for it, even if it wasn't great, Hunters were also on the list for thunderfury but only as a stat stick... we didn't have the spec or any real reason to hold it..<br />
<br />
Paladin - Hammer of Rag, Thunderfury, Val'anyr, Shadowmourne<br />
Death Knight - Shadowmourne (they can get past ones, but they're only an expansion old... saying they deserve another one already would be silly)<br />
Mage - Atiesh, Dragonwrath<br />
Warlock - Atiesh, Dragonwrath<br />
Druid - Atiesh, Dragonwrath, Hammer of Rag, Val'anyr<br />
Shaman - Hammer of Rag, Val'anyr, Dragonwrath<br />
Warriors - Hammer of Rag, Thunderfury, 2x Warblades, Shadowmourne, Thori'dal<br />
Rogue - Thunderfury, 2x Warglaives, Thori'dal (Yes, it was very common to see a rogue or warrior with it, as it was a rare drop and hunters weren't always brought in)<br />
Hunter - Thori'dal, Thunderfury (as above, only because we were on the list to be able to equip it)<br />
<br />
Hunters had a bow that was a rare drop, off a boss unkillable by 90% of raiders at the time, with an ability to generate it's own ammo, which was amazing until that whole 'feature' was removed a few pathes later<br />
<br />
Rogues have had access to legendaries that made them gods, feared by fellow raiders or enemies in a bg, and yes, Warglaives were a rare drop, but you can't really put much of a quest line to them... they were held by illidan and dropped by illidan, they had enough lore behind them as well... Thori'dal was just a spur of the moment item to keep people happy in a last ditch effort raid to keep people playing before an expansion<br />
<br />
also to feral druids, YES, poor you... you don't have a legendary for your specific spec... you play a class that can do all 4 roles effectively, and have 4 legendaries DESIGNED for your class, You had the option to hit the respec button and be useful, you could even use your cat gear in bear or healing gear as a boomkin until you fixed bits and pieces of gear, Hunters have 3 ranged DPS specs.. rerolling an entire class isn't as easy as that<br />
<br />
and watch all of the children here argue &quot;OMG EVERYTHING HUNTARD ITEM&quot;... that was a joke... a meme...<br />
<br />
It's bad enough hunters are still not at the top of the needs list for a fight that requires some special element like an interrupt... or fights that require stacking (you seem to have fixed the hit box on some fights, at the cost of my pet running off into lava or standing there doing nothing.<br />
<br />
sincerely,<br />
VeryJelly hunter<br />
<br />
well feral is a spec, that had a staff from naxx 40, sub and assa had nothing, as for counts druid had 4 legendaries 2 in since wotlk, rogues havnt had anything since tbc and only had 3(warglaives was a set, alone they where nothing more than epic, tho as a rogue i would liked if the quest would reward players with wep sets not just daggers but some axes for enhance aswell, and daggers for combat to use ss, ss will prob just become either like a mut or hemo attack. also would be nice to give hunters something since they are in the same category as rogues when it comes to waiting, something tells me that tanks get the next, then a hunter one as feral will get their with the tanks, and they will be the only one who has a tank legendarie and a dps at the same time, but thats druids for you, all in 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: &quot;ofc, we made cataclysm so all the good players would leave, now all that is left is to make the game so easy even animals can play it, and then we just send the bill to the owner, we like money, just ask Bobby Kotick.&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard about the new storage system, I lol'd and then I was like.. oh wait, that's not even bad compared to faction transfer and other pathetic attempts by blizz to milk their game just a tiny wee bit before it dies off completely, hopefully sooner than later.<br />
<br />
I miss WoW, it's not what it used to be, aka good.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmyx</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One class legendary is such a bad idea. For example : In our guild we have just got third staff, it's cool since we have a lot of people who can use it so i believe that we are going to clear firelands even in 4.3 to get thse staves. How about legendary daggers? We have 2 rogues in guild, and it's enough cause we don't need more. Ok. both of them get legendaries, what do do with third set? I'm rly disappointed since it's first only-one-class legendary since they introduced legendaries-quests instead of random-drop-legendaries. It's long time to 4.3 so I hope they won't do such a stupid move and maybe make this shiny daggers viable for more classes in ANY WAY. I know that after healers, plate dps and caster dps it's agi-users turn. But how about ferals, enhancement, hunters? Look in the future : which legendary weapon would be next in 5.X It can't be agi weapon since rogues have just had their daggers . So it means that ferals and enhancement have to wait another 3 years for MAYBE their turn ?</div></div><hr />

I don't think that this is generally a good comment for them. And it prob explains the knee jerk reaction to nerf instances without actually thinking about it.</div></div><hr />

Do you really count a bow as a rogue's weapon? They could wield it, yes, but no serious raid gave it to a rogue unless there was no hunter present and it didn't increase a rogues DPS nearly as much as it did for a hunter. So what?Warriors got the most legendaries: mace (Rag/MC), 1h sword (MC), 2x1h sword (Ili), 2h axe (ICC), which could all be used for good. So why give them another one? I'm sorry for feral / pala / dk tanks though..</div></div><hr />

Combat Rogues will be made to use these daggers as well without a DPS loss. The questline will revolve around the pure black dragon (from the egg in the Badlands) and features several Rogue-centric elements<br />

THATS SO KOOL! rouges get 2 legendarys at onetime!!! thats just sooo koool!</div></div><hr />

A tanking weapon would have been nice aswell. I know Blizzard already excluded it, but meh, better than this pathetic decision.<br />

<br />
Total guess here but it may be because the fight has a lot of flight involved where ranged can burn him down but melee can't do anything. So they want melee to be able to pump out more damage when they get him grounded.</div></div><hr />

He crashes into the Maelstrom and then he kind of emerges out of it again. And he’s so big; he’s taking up this whole area. The players hop around from the little islands in the Maelstrom. So on the first little island they might be fighting one of his tentacles, and then they have to fly to the next island and now they’re fighting a leg and then they fly to the next island and they’re fighting another big tentacle. All the while the dragon aspects, Alexstrasza and Ysera and Nozdormu, are flying around and they’re also helping the raid in this fight. So Alexstrasza might breathe fire at an important moment or Nozdormu might stop time. They’re not helping you at random. There is a little bit of strategy as to how you use their abilities too, so they’re not just background, it’s actually a pretty critical mechanic of beating the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Deathwing is so big that we need to fight with hes body parts.. <br />
But Deathwing don`t have eny tentacle.....<br />
<br />
if you'd bother to read more information in the GC interview, (he says it somwhere) he says Deathwing becomes a kind of &quot;c'thulu deathwing&quot; as you destroy his armor, corruption begins to transform his phyisical appearance, hence the tenticle porn.</div></div><hr />

Some time after 4.3 they notice that a boss dropping 1-2 yellow/red/blue/green/purple etc. gems and having people roll against each others just won't do, so they will be obtainable from somewhere else aswell.

Making it so hard to the point of ranged for your raid to gear up to the best of their abilities, making raid leaders pass out gems... in the beginning of this new tier? There are other ways you could have slowed progress in the new tier, and stopped none or weekend raiders/LFD from plowing through the t11 content even faster. <br />
<br />
Three things they should have done with epic gems instead of this. <br />
<br />
1: Had a min ilevel for the gems to be place in, such as heroic FL 391. Therefore lowering how quickly they can be consumed, and keeping lower content a tiny harder for the casual raiders.<br />
<br />
2: Dropped in raids, the 3 new dungeons, and bought with valor and or conquest (yes, so alts or eventually when players don't need them after gaining their t13).<br />
<br />
3: Required a mix of quests and random drops from the final raid for the recipes to transmute the epic gems on alchemists, with a cd between 24 hours or 72 hours.</div></div><hr />
