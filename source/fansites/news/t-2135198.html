As the holidays approach, we wanted to take a chance to share some information on an upcoming raid tuning adjustment as well as the release date for Nighthold.<br />
<br />
Trial of Valor will see a set of tuning adjustments next week, focused mainly on Heroic and Mythic difficulty, which should help groups overcome the challenges of the Trial as they prepare for Nighthold. <br />
<br />
Which brings us to the release date for Nighthold itself: We are aiming to unlock Normal and Heroic Nighthold on January 17, 2017. Raid Finder wings and Mythic difficulty will release during the weeks following, which we will share more specific details on at a later time.<br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing you in the Nighthold!<br />
<br />
<br />
Prestige Bug<br />
Thanks for bringing this to our attention. There was a bug with players who reached Honor Level 50, Prestige Level 4 where honor earned was still being accumulated past the cap. When the Prestige Level was increased yesterday, the accumulated honor was applied and the character progressed through those new Prestige Levels.<br />
<br />
The rewards were legitimately earned through playtime, however, so we wonâ€™t be removing them. This bug should be fixed in 7.1.5, so that others in similar situations will earn those rewards immediately, and so that this will not affect future seasons.</div></div><hr />

NH is not the next tier - its the FIRST tier. NH was there from the very begining, just not opened until soon. Story-wise speaking, ToV takes place AFTER NH. After release of NH I expect ToV difficulty to drop massively.<br />

That wouldnt be that bad tbh.<br />
First, the top guilds wouldnt be forced to tryhard so much.<br />
Second, they would have enough time to gear up for the final boss, meaning no overtuned encounter and no need for some gimmicks/suspicious tactics.<br />
Third, the whiners wouldnt complain about the content (that they will never complete anyway) is cleared so fast.<br />
<br />
They could do something like ICC. New wing each week (if i remember correctly). Ooooh and only 50 tries for the final boss please :D</div></div><hr />

We can hope. It'd be a huge hit to the value of splitfarming, which I think is a good thing. If Mythic is a few weeks later, you can be a little more patient with Nighthold. Splitfarming will still have value, but it won't feel as important, I think.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure where you got this. That the Nighthold raid was designed before the ToV raid doesn't mean that it takes place earlier in the lore. Heck, Nighthold the raid was finished before the Suramar content leading in to taking over the city and entering the Nighthold.</div></div><hr />

It clearly takes place after because we get Illidan's soul from Helya to put in Xera (soul prism of the illidari follow up) to put in his body which Gul'dan has in NH .<br />

Actually you are the one that seems confused and misinformed. Blizzard does not define raids by tiers. They are all separate and as they stated, the achievement for xavius hc goes away with the release of nighthold. its come to a point where we should stop using tier aswell to be honest</div></div><hr />

Bro, people are literally linking you a blue post confirming curve will be removed when Nighthold hits. Who cares about pendatics and what 'defines' a tier when the literal word from the lion's mouth itself says curve will be going away. So maybe less answering back and more paying attention to what a couple of people are trying to tell you, yes?<br />
<br />
And it kind of makes sense, too. The gear advantage of NH items would defeat the challenge of curve: Xavius.</div></div><hr />

?? They did not say that. It's just kinda pointless to run around in EN mythic with NH HC/Mythic gear and T-sets. There would be 0 challenge anymore.<br />

ToV must be the worst raid ever released. I take trial of crusader any day over it. The odyn fight is so boring after doing it countless times in HoV<br />
<br />
Speak for yourself. <br />
<br />
I for one think that ToV is one of the best &quot;filler&quot; raids ever made. Not only is it challenging and has great lore, but the battles are also quite diverse. I don't know how you can get bored from the Odyn fight per say. After you repeat a fight multiple times, it always becomes repetitive, duh.<br />
<br />
Only &quot;filler&quot; raids I consider better are: Malygos - Eye of Eternity (WotLK) and Terrace (MoP). Terrace only because it had cool new mechanics, not for lore.<br />
<br />
Trial of the Crusader was alright, but nothing Special imo. The only interesting battle was fighting against Lord Jaraxxus and for lore intermissions the feud of Garrosh/Varian alongside Lich King appearance and shattering the ground. The first boss(es) was basically killing bigger trash mobs. The battle against the alliance was again only killing trash mobs in a priority order. The Valkyr's was okayish, but nothing Special either and Anubarak was a joke (hit, dig, hit, dig, hit, yawn).<br />
<br />
I could continue with the other &quot;filler&quot; raids we get from Blizzard, but most of them have random unnecessary lore and unintuitive battles (see Halion or Sartharion for example).<br />
<br />
This one is finally releasing Odyn (the probably strongest titan-forged) from his &quot;prison&quot; and slaying his &quot;stepdaughter&quot;. I hoped they would've done more with the deal Helya and Sylvanas have made in the stormheim questline. Well, maybe there will be more, but with Helya dead it seems like the forgot (which I hope they didn't). The only stale battle in that encounter is against Guarm tbh, he's just a dps check boss. I guess most raids require a dps check boss though, else we would feel like something's missing.</div></div><hr />

it doesnt have to say anything - removal of AoTC is equal to end of tier - gear levels doesnt matter , difficulty doesnt matter - only hting that matter is removal of AoTC. which confirms end of tier.</div></div><hr />

So you blowing all of this out of you ass is now an official statement? You realize the reason they are removing it is because the challenge is gone with nighthold gear coming into the picture?</div></div><hr />

One tier is Emerald Nightmare + Nighthold, another one in 7.2 and another in 7.3.<br />
<br />
And no, AotC doesn't end it. Otherwise, ToV is part of tier's 19 and 20 because it end's once 7.2 launches. Plus, that'd also mean that NH as T20 would be dropping T19 gear because that's how tier's have been defined by.<br />
<br />
Tiers have been out longer than achievs. Achievs do not set what a tier is.</div></div><hr />

It took place before. It was a buildup for ICC as Arthas appeared a last time in Lich King appearance and shattered the ground of the Arena to lead into Anub'Araks cave/kingdom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? That makes me so fucking mad right now. When you think you have viable argument, blizz puts some random thing that completely nullifies the argument.<br />
Its as if we were asked during Trial of the Crusader to go to ICC and slay LK for an item that will help us defeat Anub'arak... Fucking blizz and their inconsistencies, one would think that story of 7.1 raid would take place AFTER the story of 7.0 raid. Fools...<br />

<br />
I know it. I was arguing that, since 3.2 raid took place before 3.3 raid (storywise), so should 7.0 take place before 7.1. But apparently we are required to gather an item from 7.1 boss to complete quest chain for 7.0 boss... no fucking logic in this.</div></div><hr />

Who cares about pendatics and what 'defines' a tier when the literal word from the lion's mouth itself says curve will be going away. So maybe less answering back and more paying attention to what a couple of people are trying to tell you, yes?<br />
<br />
And it kind of makes sense, too. The gear advantage of NH items would defeat the challenge of curve: Xavius.<br />
<br />
He is actually right, both are the same tier. The same way HM and BRF were. Blizzard stated that they would only do a diferent time frame between EN/NH instead. Removing the feat doesn't mean it's a new tier now.<br />
<br />
The only diference is that they don't want people doing the same thing they did with HM/BRF. Taking gear from BRF and easily stomping the achievement from HM.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you actually retarded? Multiple people have even linked a source of blizzard saying that it's going away when nighthold opens.<br />
<br />
Read again what he said, removing the feat isn't the same as saying that it's a new tier.<br />
<br />
He is just saying that both raids are part of the same tier, as Blizzard already said since the launch. It's the same thing as HM/BRF, except that they won't allow you to stomp EN with NH gear like players did in HM with BRF gear.<br />
<br />
Blizzard just played smart this time (but ToV will also be stomped with NH gear, but the feat will stay, wich makes no sense).<br />
