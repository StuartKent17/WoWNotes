<br />
Like everyone said.<br />
<br />
you are basing that on absolutely no information though. other than &quot;last expansion took a year from announcement&quot;<br />
<br />
I am sure you were also in the group yelling &quot;THEY WON'T ANNOUNCE AT GAMESCON, ITS ALWAYS AT BLIZZCON RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE&quot;<br />
<br />
everyone has not said it either. but hey, if it does take a year i welcome you to pm me &quot;i told you so&quot;</div></div><hr />

And maybe 1 dungeon with some old boss brought back to life so they dont need to make a new model<br />
and maybe some new garrison crap or even worse the shipyard shit expanded on.. or EVEN worse Ashran still being around.<br />
<br />
Man so much to look forward too.. maybe give humans another trinket as a racial.</div></div><hr />

BlizzCon is also basically a gigantic nerd party and is tons of fun just to go and socialize with people with similar interests from around the country/world.<br />

<br />
Exactly! Who are these blizzcon complainers? Blizzcon 2014 was one of the best blizzcons they ever had (except for the band). Movie panel, Legacy of the Void announcement cinematic, hearthstone expansion, new heroes for heroes, an entirely new IP/genre with an amazing cinematic, hearthstone tournament, WCS. Worst part by far? WoW Q&amp;A just like every year. <br />
<br />
This is going to be a fantastic blizzcon. More movie news, more heroes, hopefully a new adventure for heartstone, possibly beta for overwatch, legacy stuff, and most likely the cinematic for the next wow expansion with a launch release/beta announcement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thetruth1400</div><div class="date">2015-07-29, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh...<br />
<br />
Never would have thought they don't save it for Blizzcon...<br />
<br />
They've really got no choice. They've got to get information out about it now, so they can start the beta, and most likely we'll know at Blizzcon the release date for their Legion expansion. <br />
<br />
I have a feeling that Blizzcon will be all the hype about features, zones, etc while Gamescom is going to be fairly light on material. They don't want any more of their selling features getting cut and people saying they were promises. Personally, I don't see how they can heavily advertise features then cut them last minute and try and pretend it wasn't a promise, but whatever, that's why people don't trust them as a company anymore.<br />
<br />
So chances are as follows; Gamescom, beta shortly after, Blizzcon with announced release date, and the expansion release just in time for the holiday rush.<br />
<br />
<br />
I should be excited but I'm not. WoD left a really bad taste in my mouth.<br />
You and pretty much the rest of the player base honestly. The next expansion is going to have to be something major and full of quality game play or we can all officially kiss WoW goodbye as it dies the death it deserves due to the lack of anything from Blizzard for three entire expansion. If we get a fourth expansion in a row with the level of garbage we have seen, this game deserves the sub number plummet it is seeing.<br />
<br />
Likewise, the next expansion better be no more than $30. WoD didn't justify an increase in price at all. It was 100% a cash grab to cover their 25% loss from the previous expansion, in which they made up that difference by charging 25% more.</div></div><hr />

Also on another note. I hope it's about something good. I like WoW. It got me through tough times and was one of my favourite games before WoD spoiled it all for me.<br />

But you know, the post doesn't officially say &quot;expansion&quot; just something around the game. Not saying that it won't happen, just that it doesn't flow with their normal game plan.<br />
<br />
so I gather the line that says &quot;where we’ll be unveiling the next chapter of the World of Warcraft saga. . . .&quot; is just a typo by the Blue who posted it?? And from Blizzards site http://us.battle.net/wow/en/ New World of Warcraft Expansion Unveiling at gamescom 2015 – Live Stream August 6, so yes it is just our imagination..</div></div><hr />

They actually made more money: every token bought by a person with gold was first bought for $20 which means someone else paid for the subscription of the person who payed with gold but for $5 extra. Or you could view it as people who buy gold now paying blizzard instead of rando sites.

Then the game would just be called World of Orcs, where anything and everything is Orc.. Azeroth has been renamed to Orceroth, and the main continents are Orcimdor and Eastern Orcingdoms..

<br />
They're either comfortable enough with their current line up of announcements for Blizzcon, and they feel the need to release information on the expansion now (probably due to subscriber losses) or one of the multiple leaked &quot;expansions&quot; are actually correct. Either way, this feels like they're saving face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, probably the same stuff they get every year, some physical goodies, a wow pet and some other digital goodies for SC2/Diablo/etc., and maybe a beta key for X6's expansion. Oh, and playability of stuff on the floor if they have it. If they had announced it at Blizzcon, nothing would change in that regard. The only difference is that Blizzcon attendees would have been out the 'experience' of seeing the announcement in the same room as them, that's all. Maybe if that's all you're going to Blizzcon for...you might be pissed, but ever since Bliz started streaming the big announcements online as they happen...it's not been a big deal.<br />
<br />
Edit: I don't get people that are pissed Blizz is announcing the expac here instead of at Blizzcon. As much as it has been certain years in the past, Blizzcon is not &quot;WoWcon&quot;. They've had good years without wow(I actually really enjoyed 2014, I mean we got new details for SC2, Heroes, hearthstone, and most of all, a new IP). And why the hell would announcing at Gamescom mean they have 'nothing' to show for it at Blizzcon? We have no idea if they'll trickle details at Gamescom(maybe just the reveal trailer and a scant bit of details about the world/major changes), to showcase tons of details about it at Blizzcon. It's not likely they'll spill everything possible at Gamescom, then go dry for a 9-12 months....</div></div><hr />

When you put a token up on the AH you get the current asking price in gold immediately IIRC. After that the token is out of your hands until it sells.</div></div><hr />

Well, guess I'm out for the next expansion. After forking over $170 for this expansion (3x WoD + 1x DD upgrade), I'm not forking over another $50 let alone another $150 for a half baked expansion that's 50-75% as long as any previous one while also being more expensive.<br />
<br />
I'm not getting onto the hype train this time. I've been on it since WotLK was announced (I missed the TBC one since I started in TBC), was excited for Cata and even MoP, but now? I'll wait until the next expansion is done before I care to touch it. I don't care what Blizzard reveals at Gamescom. Chances are a good chunk of it will be cut by release or won't be what we expected anyway. I'm not falling for Blizzard's hype trap again. ONLY way I'll get the next expansion at release is if it's free. But this is Blizzard and expansions have gone up about $5 every expansion. It'll probably be $55-60 this time. Even if it came with a &quot;free&quot; 100 boost, I have more alts than I care to have. Blizzard keeps trying to kill off alts. I don't NEED nor WANT another alt. If they pull the &quot;free&quot; boosted toon again, they better do a cheaper version without it. I need another alt like a hole in the head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes and no. it had its nice things. but as raider and sadly ex wower. a couple of things ruined it. the fubbeling around with dungeons...they changed how dungeons &quot;help&quot; with gear and why you need to do them a couple of times.<br />
<br />
and stuff to do between raids...pff either grinds and pointless stuff. pretty much every other mmo has a permenant base ( not a garrison you put 30k in and the loose next expansion) or multible stuff to do. and for instance pvp...you do not want to know how much time i spent in line to get in ashran and never be able 2 get in.<br />
as raider if you want to do mytic on relax mode it was impossible to get decent teams for that. most either wanted hardcore mytic ( so then 25 all the times). 25 fixxed mytic was for semi mytic people a deathstroke. seen allot of guilds and groups fall apart because of this. used 2 raid 80% to 90% atleast mytic cleared before nerf.<br />
and classes....dodnt get me started on that. bring the class not the player Bullsh*t.<br />
as healer ( druid) i was totally f*ck*d if i was in a team with other decent healers from the paladin, priest kind. and if i look at the dps meters some things did change but most things didnt. same goes for tanking. ( only times i felled it was player and not class was in dungeons) <br />
and the last one really did me in. Most classes can do everything so there is no use for certain classes because ( insert uber class) always does things better. and the feeling i was need became very low. and the worst part of this...its nothing new. each expansion the same bullsh*t. druids start out low, then become good but blizzard doesnt like good druid so nerf hammer incomming. just look at all the rankings. every raid instance has a certian class that dominates 1 or 2 fights....you only see ( instert class) in the top 5/10. never druids<br />
i came to a point i was only there for my cooldowns. where most groups cleared a certain boss with 4 or 5 healers. we did it with 3 and i was wrath casting/healing 90%of the time...</div></div><hr />
