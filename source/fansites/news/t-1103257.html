Despite that, the three 'new' races are practically Night Elf/Draenei/Tauren reskins, but I can give them the benefit of the doubt in hoping that all the 'race' efforts are going into the new race models instead.</div></div><hr />

Riiiight. And if Blizzard implemented updated player race models but little to no new NPC models, you'd be here bitching instead about how lazy Blizzard is for recycling old content yet again. I swear, some people just whine for the sake of whining.</div></div><hr />

Nah I don't think so, since mounts scale with your riding skill now I believe its this one mount. I remember reading somewhere that you get the Yak mount through other means and that the Pandaren mount was specifically stated to be Serpents.<br />

<br />
I don't know about them, but I have... However, this could be a lot differen't. I wouldn't be surprised if in the least, they make you do 20 more dailies for each color.<br />
<br />
Maybe after raising one you can just buy all of the other ones, though... which is like netherwing if I remember correctly.. get one for free/through dailies, buy the others. Guess we'll just have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Are you sure? Are the Pandarens getting some other serpent mount then? I know I read on the front page a couple days ago that Pandarens are getting Serpents.<br />
<br />
<br />
whatever it is im sure everyone will have it and itll be as common as any other mount</div></div><hr />

However, this could be a lot differen't. I wouldn't be surprised if in the least, they make you do 20 more dailies for each color.<br />
<br />
Maybe after raising one you can just buy all of the other ones, though... which is like netherwing if I remember correctly.. get one for free/through dailies, buy the others. Guess we'll just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
Not really, you can only get one netherdrake, and you end-up having to pay for it as well.<br />
<br />
If you are not hell bent on collecting mounts or if they don't put a 150-mounts reward, then there is no reason to really get all of them, other that the one you like the most.<br />
<br />
This is rather similar to the Venomhide Ravasaur questline.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why so many throwaway npc races instead of updating play models? It seems like such a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Its called putting in new content.<br />
I'm betting you'd be one of those omfg Blizz rehashed everything, if they had done what you are trying to demand instead.</div></div><hr />

And from what blizz have said, to get them it seams to be similar to the venomhide ravasaur/winterspring frostsaber. <br />
With the whole getting a hatchling and doing dailies to 'raise' it and then some extra final quest(s) where you 'break it in', prob similar to the seahorse mount in vash'jir.</div></div><hr />

For Yaunka, I don't remember seeing female Taunka. Could be wrong being all Alliance over here. Seen a female Ogre? They are hanging out with the female Mogu. A lot of NPC races don't have both sex models. I suppose it wastes art assets to give them both sexes considering it'd only be an aesthetic effect.</div></div><hr />

Is there a quote from the Devs confirming this to be the case? I like both mounts I just must've misread the quote. Having said that, I FREAKIN CALLED IT.

Wrong. You get one netherdrake for free when you reach exalted rep, and there's an NPC back on the nether... whatever faction it is place that sells the others for (if I remember right) 200 gold.<br />

I believe he is wrong, the Pandaren have been talked about to get a turtle land mount, and I think one of these serpents (this may be incorrect but Pandaren may not need the dailies don't judge me!). <br />
I think they also said anyone could get these but it would have 20 days of dailies just like the wintersaber nowadays. <br />
http://www.wowdb.com/items/82765-dragon-turtle-egg may be the land mount I talked about. I remember them saying someone about it just before beta in one of the interviews.</div></div><hr />

Meaning all that's common between a Mogu and a Draenei is an animation skeleton - and that was preserved, because those take an donkey-load of time to make, even for a specialist.So stop crying about reskins when you get completely new models only rigged to old animation skeletons.<br />
<br />
Also, people still don't appear to know what the difference between &quot;completely redone&quot; and &quot;added a few polys&quot; is. This is lazy, hastily done work, on a severely limited budget allotted for the expansion team this go around. EVERY expansion team is given a smaller budget than the last. Hope you guys enjoy running out of a content quicker than Cata, and all the &quot;new&quot; models, which just so happen to look like another model, except with a 10poly necklace, or horn, or gills.<br />

No, it's not &quot;added a few polys in&quot;, because if it was, they'd still have a draenei face and body... except for a few polygons. That is not a draenei face, that is not a draenei body. It's just rigged to a draenei skeleton. That. Is. All.<br />
<br />
Because they're not Yaunka. They're Yaungols. It's an error in the OP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wont be demonic influance he falls to, it'll be the sha. He hates anything to do with demons so more than likely wouldn't touch the stuff.<br />
<br />
My theory from what we know is this. <br />
<br />
Ji Firepaw becomes the hordes Ambassador he would likely tell the people in charge about his own people and there battles with the Sha. (This is probably what he later comes to regret) Garosh likes useing anything and everything as a weapon to be used against the alliance. He would more than likely put a group of people incharge of experimenting with sha energy/creatures. They would need somewhere out of the way to do this...<br />
<br />
Ragefire Chasm ;) <br />
<br />
From the video we know that the dark shamans are a group of red skinned orcs. Garosh is extreamly paranoid about fel energy so probably wouldn't trust any green skined (fel tainted) orcs, and more than likely to get untainted maghar (red skined orcs) to work on it. <br />
<br />
The Sha feed on anger/rage/hate. The element of Fire represents anger/rage/hate. So the people he would need to work on it would be shamans due to there closeness with the elements. But this would also mean that the shamans focused in useing fire, and would be suseptable to sha corruption.<br />
<br />
Also at the end of the video (when Jessy turned in the Corrupted Amulets) the text said something along the lines of &quot;this will show what happens when people fail&quot; quite a large hint that they already knew about it and something went wrong, aka they became corrupted by Sha.<br />
<br />
Considering how thick skulled Garosh is, I doubt something like this would be enough to make him realise that it wouldn't work, and carries on with the research. His closeness to the Sha energy and his constant state of simmering anger even when he isn't doing anything will be what causes his downfall in the end.</div></div><hr />

Learn your Orc lore. Maghar = Brown. Tainted = Greenish. Fel/Chaos Orcs = Red. Have you seriously forgotten TBC already?</div></div><hr />

Implying there's alot of new stuff in these new race models, first thing you think of is &quot;Oh look a Male Nelf Reskin with a few extras pinned on...&quot; &quot;Oh look a Male Draenei Reskin with a few extras pinned on...&quot; &quot;Oh look a Male Tauren Reskin with a few extras pinned on...&quot;<br />

The updating of Ragefire Chasm looks good so far. Less trash, cool shadow swirlies, hell hounds... My only objection is the final boss. Maybe it's just me, but I'm not quite fond of worm(-ish) type mobs. They're big, granted, but not my preference. Especially Magmaw clones.<br />
<br />
Also, I very much hope that instead of altering my RFC achievement to accommodate the change, they'll move the current to a feat of strength. I certainly was rather annoyed to find that my achievement for killing Edwin VanCleef had turned into killing Vanessa VanCleef. :|</div></div><hr />

That goes a little beyond just reusing the same skeleton when the base model looks exactly the same except a different face. It's just a draenei/nelf/tauren body with a different head and different skin.<br />

Sigh.<br />
<br />
They are not reskins. A reskin would just replace the colors of a model.<br />
<br />
A model is all the outer features on a skeleton.<br />
<br />
The word you are looking for is the inner workings of a model, the skeleton. These models share skeletons of previous races. This has been done before to save time and cost. It is foolish to make a skeleton for every single model when models will end up having the same skeleton structure.</div></div><hr />
