&quot;Upper Deck has released the names and screen shots of cards from the upcoming Drums of War expansion set, including the fan-favorite Loot cards! Visit WoWTCG.com for more information and images! <br />
<br />
Drums of War hits stores on October 28th, bringing new content, including fresh locations and card types! This World of Warcraft Trading Card Game expansion offers players great new insights into their favorite game and new Loot cards providing exclusive in-game items that everyone will be proud to show off in Azeroth.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Red Bearon<br />
The Red Bearon is the latest in epic mounts, and one of the easiest ways in Azeroth to score a bear mount! “The Battle Bear” is the fourth exclusive mount from the World of Warcraft TCG, and continues the tradition of giving players access to unique and exciting mounts. Similar to previous Loot card mounts, The Red Bearon Loot card unlocks the ability for players to purchase either a normal or an epic version of this mind-blowing mount. <br />

<br />
Owned! <br />
This uncommon Loot card offers the newest in victory flaunting. Used in-game, this card gives you “The Flag of Ownership,” and will tell everyone that you just bested your opponent. In addition to a special emote, you will literally plant a flag in the corpse of your fallen enemy. As if that wasn’t enough, the flag flies a giant thumbs down, the ultimate in humiliation. <br />
<br />

<br />
Slashdance<br />
This super common Loot card gives players a stack of Party G.R.E.N.A.D.E.S., complete with targeting circle! Aim carefully at a glum group of characters and then throw your grenade. Everyone in the target circle will receive a one minute “buff” that causes them to dance ‘til there’s a smile on their face! Not only will all the targeted characters bust a move, they will also get to enjoy some streamers and confetti, making it a real party! <br />

Cold Weather Flying questline removed in final version<br />
Making it purchasable makes it easier for players to get. I understand you have 3 alts to feed and as each of them levels up they will get the gold to purchase it.<br />
<br />
We haven't given an exact total number of new daily quests that will be available in the expansion, but there will be more of them to do and along with all the new quests I don't think reaching this number will be an issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10972018131-cold-weather-flying-slap-in-the-face.html))<br />
<br />
Avoidance viability in tanking<br />
Imagine a boss that hits 300 times a second for 1 point of damage. In that case, the avoidance tank with 50% dodge probably will avoid around half the hits per second, while the mitigation tank with 50% damage reduction will absorb half of every hit. It's possible the avoidance tank will miss his dodge roll 300 times in that second, but it's statistically unlikely. It's more likely that both tanks take the same amount of damage.<br />
<br />
Now imagine the very slow boss who swings once every minute for 25K damage. The avoidance tank will die if he ever fails to dodge twice in a row, but you are almost certainly going to heal him back up in between swings so that doesn't happen. In this other ridiculous extreme, the difference between mitigation and avoidance is also not a big deal.<br />
<br />
The streaky nature of avoidance is only a problem when you fail to avoid several times in a row on mobs that hit faster than you can heal, or when the hits can be really large. Without crushing blows, the hits will be smaller.<br />
<br />
The other problem with avoidance is when healers just can't get into the rythym of healing and overheal a lot, run OOM, or get caught by surprise. But that varies a lot depending on the skill of the healer and the types of spells. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10972067998-avoidance-dr-and-death-knights.html))<br />

Tree balancing and Unholy damage<br />
We have Blood, Frost and Unholy at pretty similar dps at the moment so I'm not sure why Blood would feel underpowered for you guys. Bloody Vengeance alone gives Blood a big boost to white damage, while Frost really doesn't have much that can compete.<br />
<br />
Gargoyle does do nice burst damage, but that's at the expense of Unholy Blight usually, which in turn hurts your Scourge Strikes. But we are messing with Unholy now to deflate its damage a little. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10972027296-blood-pass-this-week.html))<br />
<br />
Blood-Caked Blade cooldown<br />
Yeah, I think it's a bug. We can't think of a good reason why it needs a cooldown at all. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10972017935-bug-bloodcaked-blade-10s-cd.html))<br />
<br />
Frigid Dreadplate<br />
We rewrote the spell and the tooltip to be simpler and less confusing. It's now just 1/2/3% less chance to be melee hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10971908849-frigid-dreadplate--is-this-talent-working.html))<br />

New Druid out of combat rez in WotLK<br />
We don't think an out of combat rez for druids is a balance problem. We did it to make druids more attractive healers for 5-player dungeons. It was frustrating for someone to die and have to run back nearly every time with a druid healing.<br />
<br />
The only possible balance issue that comes to mind is the druid who stealths into an instance and brings back the whole group to get around respawns. But really, that seems like such a minor concern compared to he major hassle of not being able to rez fallen comrades more often than once every 10 min, that we thought it was worth just making the change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10971907741-my-problem-with-the-druids-new-ooc-rez.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Upcoming hunter changes<br />
We probably are going to let Barrage affect Aimed Shot. We looked at Explosive Shot again and its damage seemed like a significant increase over Arcane Shot, but if Survival ends up low, then Explosive is probably where we'll try to make up the difference. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971928119-explosive-and-aimed-shot-reevaluation.html))<br />
<br />
Master's Call not working properly<br />
Yeah, we're working on it. It's hard to tell sometimes with abilities that involve pet movement if the data are set up correctly and there's just a code bug somewhere (that may happen infrequently) or if the spell itself is just borked. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971908326-gc--masters-call.html))<br />
<br />
Ferocious Inspirations<br />
I suspect it is supposed to be raid-wide. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971928367-ferocious-inspiration-raidwide.html))<br />
<br />
Too much haste on mail gear ?<br />
We do put a lot of haste on gear. Part of that is because we don't have a huge canvas to work with. We can't put a ton of Strength and Spirit on hunter gear. Also, keep in mind that we aren't trying to make the best possible gear for you. We want you to toss out less optimal pieces for more optimal pieces. Finally, keep in mind that gear is one of the things we use to let players demonstrate mastery of the game. Making the decision of whether that new ring or belt is an upgrade should require a little bit of thought. That's what makes it interesting. But I will bring up the issue of haste and we can talk it over again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br />
<br />
Low dodge % in WotLK<br />
I seem to be having trouble coming up with a way to explain it that makes sense to you. We don't want you to have as much dodge as a rogue or a druid or a tank. If you have great offense and great defense then we're not sure how to balance you. We want you to run away when someone gets close, not stand and take the hits. Mages Blink or Ice Block or Frost Nova to get away from melee. We gave hunters Disengage to try to do the same thing. Note that we don't want it to be an automatic get of jail free card -- sometimes we want the melee to kill you. Maybe they still kill you too much, but it's hard for us to tell if that's a hunter failing or Retadins and Unholy DKs doing too much burst damage. Hunters without LOS issues seem to be able to kill stuff just fine, so it may be that is your Arena weakness and not melee getting up in your stuff. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br />
<br />
Wing Clip effectivity and mana cost<br />
It's still a 50% snare, right? The duration is shorter than Hamstring, but is duration really what's killing you? It's possible it's too expensive. We can look at that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br />
<br />
Disengage<br />
Disengage isn't supposed to remove snares. We do want it to move you the same distance whether snared or not, but that takes new code, so it will take a little while. We did recently lower the mana cost from 14% (I think) to 5%. It is off the GCD now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br />
<br />
Scatter Shot<br />
We talk a lot about making it baseline, but it's also a very attractive talent in one particular spec. It's hard to argue that hunters of all classes (except maybe rogues) need more CC. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10972138500-feedback-hunter-concerns-civil-edition.html))<br />
<br />
Aspect of the Viper<br />
We like the design of Viper overall. It's cooler to have to shift your strategy to regen without actually interrupting your ability to deal damage. (Maybe it fits the mage class better to go hide in a corner and build up mana again.) I think Viper works fine for PvE. But I do think it presents a problem in PvP when hunters just can't get their mana back. We're talking a lot about to fix this, but I am going to be very hesitant to promise anything because this forum tends to get pretty upset when we change our minds or otherwise don't deliver.

Future of Arms of Warrior not determined yet<br />
Go find one of those posts of the Arms warriors in Naxx stacking crit. Sudden Death, Overpower and Deep Wounds are up constantly. The dps is at the top of the charts. We're not sure what to do about it yet, because I don't think Fury is that high. Hardly anyone (maybe the hunters) is that high.

<br />
<br />
I have 1x 70 and I have epic flight, and over 12k gold waiting for the xpack. If you have 4, then you should (in theory) have 48k gold. People on my server have to roll extra toons just because they've capped out the in-game gold.. it's called THE ECONOMY.. profit from it.<br />
<br />
I for one don't mind paying a mere 1k gold for the ability to fly - have you I'd rather it just be a quest if it's still level capped @ 77.. but I trust Blizzard in their decisions, I mean they have done a great job so far. <br />
<br />
And yeah, I know, one toon at seventy? what a loser! I'm working on another =) I just found it hard to justify not gearing up my one main as best as I could.. and now that raiding is dead (where I come from) I have a few weeks to get a toon rollin'. Wish all my friends weren't already playing wow so we could level up 3x as fast.. weaksauce.</div></div><hr />

I actually play the TCG, and the loot cards are a nice addition, but this latest set of rewards just seem to have had so little effort put into them. But that has kinda been the feeling with the last set too.<br />

Admitedly, the rewards can't be too awesome, as then it's gamebreaking for being able to buy things in RL to boost ingame.<br />

Will I get for example the Spectral Tiger, or will I have a chance to get the new cards, like the bear or whatever?<br />
<br />
<br />
I got the CE of TBC, it had 2 unique gathered Hero cards, a unique quest card, and that may have been it. I think the Wrath CE has at least 2 boost packs as well, so there is a chance you will get a loot card, it just depends what set the boosters come from.<br />
<br />
Last point: They no longer print the Tiger card.</div></div><hr />

Do dailies on all of them? are you joking? takes me about 3-4 hours to do all the dailies.. and I don't have time to do that on every char 16 hours a day?<br />
<br />
so at a rate of 200g a day and give I need 19000g to get epic flyers on my 3 chars that dont have it and 1 char that needs the winter flying.<br />
<br />
Thats 95 days aka 3 months of doing nothing but 25 dailies every single day? given the fact I only play every other day or so I'm look at 6months of my game time spent doing dailys so that I can enjoy the fundiment mobility of the game? <br />
<br />
Nah, I have better things to do with my time like pvp, arenas leveling proffessions, 5 and 10 man instances. so looks like I simply won't be having a flying mount on any of my chars since the only char that does have it is an alt I dont really play much (prot paladin).</div></div><hr />

If you have 4, then you should (in theory) have 48k gold. People on my server have to roll extra toons just because they've capped out the in-game gold.. it's called THE ECONOMY.. profit from it.<br />
<br />
I for one don't mind paying a mere 1k gold for the ability to fly - have you I'd rather it just be a quest if it's still level capped @ 77.. but I trust Blizzard in their decisions, I mean they have done a great job so far. <br />
<br />
And yeah, I know, one toon at seventy? what a loser! I'm working on another =) I just found it hard to justify not gearing up my one main as best as I could.. and now that raiding is dead (where I come from) I have a few weeks to get a toon rollin'. Wish all my friends weren't already playing wow so we could level up 3x as fast.. weaksauce.<br />
<br />
WTF? mate simply because I have 4 level 70's doesnt mean I player 4x as much as you? these alts have already cost me 1000s of G's powerlevelings proffessions and rep that are pretty much required at level 70 aswell has shelling out for mounts and such..<br />
<br />
I mean when leveling from 1-70 you actually lose money or rather won't have enough money to buy all your skills and mounts etc unless you either stop at low level to play the AH or if your selling everything from your proffessions.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously at the moment I'm leveling this priest soo fast I'm not making a dim.. I've had to take atleast 200g from my main to buy skills and mounts.</div></div><hr />

It's a shame the blues aren't banning people for that yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Total bloody joke! 1k gold for &quot;cold weather flying&quot; they promised us they wouldnt make a ruddy moneysink just so we can use the mounts we already folked out 5k gold on. I mean seriously for a new or alt your looking at..<br />
<br />
total: 7845g<br />
<br />
I already have 4 level 70s soon to be 6 (doing RAF) and I've only been able to get a flying mount for one them so far! this just makes it even harder :@(<br />
<br />
<br />
FYI, the quest that was connected to cold weather flying was also asking you to &quot;donate&quot; 800g or something. 200g for the ease of getting it fast is quite the luxury.<br />
<br />
I got 5 level 70s at the moment, and each and every one of them has a 280% flying mount (or faster), working on the 6th currently and I've still easily got cash enough to buy 300 flying skill for half a dozen more alts.<br />
<br />
So, you must be doing 'something' wrong.... don't blame blizzard.<br />
Try wasting less gold on buying stuff from the AH, and use it to sell more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much what I was thinking.<br />
<br />
In previous sets, the rewards have included a pet in most cases:<br />
<br />
Azeroth: Hippogryph Hatchling, (Looks ugly as sin tho &gt;.&gt;)<br />
Dark Portal: Bananas the monkey (I know people that would kill for this, given how cute it looks)<br />
Fires of Outland: None, but it had the Spectral Tiger, which initially was a bit &quot;meh&quot; in graphics, and they changed that.<br />
Legion: Dragon Kite (I'd kill for this one! Dragon, huge, and hit by bolts of lightning now and again)<br />
And!: The Rocket Chicken (Ok, you have the non rocket armed version, but this one is funny to watch when trying to take off, and moreso when it manages... then explodes)<br />
Betrayer: Weather machine (Maybe not the standard expectation of a vanity pet, but it followed you like one)<br />
Illidan: Ethereal Companion (Again, not a standard style, but still ish)<br />
<br />
Out of the items I have, and know others to have, I just feel they aren't putting as much effort into the items nowadays.<br />
<br />
The rocket mount could look so much better, and even at times I prefer the fact an alt i have has the Engineering one. I still also swap around mounts, so sometimes use my Gryphon, just as the Rocket can get a bit dull.<br />
Tabards: I like these, but a change in design might have been nice instead of just all the recolouring.<br />
Pets: Some could look better... that Hippogryph worries me...<br />
Misc items: Picnic table was nice, then they brought out the V-day one tho, and while you can only get the food from the card version, still a bit too similar.</div></div><hr />

Dispite what you might think / say making 40, 000g takes a pretty long time for your average none economic student. I apologize for finding other things to do in this MMO game other then playing the AH min / maxing my profession and grinding 25 dailies 5 times a week to make gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am not sure what you want emulous.. at one post you say you dont want to spend gold to get mounts, then you spend all that gold powerleveling professions for your alts... <br />
<br />
if it takes you 3-4 hours to do 25 daily's on 1 toon, then you are obviously doing it wrong <br />
<br />
there are tonnes of guides, walkthru's and even mods that help you streamline the 25 dailys.. once you do a couple of rounds using these, it goes a lot faster.<br />
<br />
if you don't want to put in the effort, then maybe you don't deserve the prize.</div></div><hr />

1K doesn't really bother me I have plenty and I'm sure there will be plenty more gold to be had in Lich King itself but come on guys doing a quest lines are actually meant to be fun and I'd feel much happier doing a quest line than just paying for something. Every aspect of the game just gets simplar and simplar whats next pay 5K gold and instantly be lvl 80 another 15K and full epic. <br />
<br />
Ok I'm joking around and making this a QQ post but still the blizzard blue poster said &quot;Making it purchasable makes it easier for players to get.&quot; blimey the quest was a simple 30 minutes work for heavens sake I don't need that making easier! Fair enough if you had to kill end guy in Naxx in a 30 minute timed run with one hand tied behind your back then fair enough but I'm not 5 years old I actually like putting a bit of effort in once in a while it gives me a purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not all are readily open to take, some require pre reqs, others certain rep levels.<br />
Not all classes, and especially specs, can kill things at the same rate.<br />
Professions have their own daily quests, if you don't have a gathering prof, you can't do those, and some are easier than others.<br />
Not everyone has the same reaction speeds, analytical thinking, and such, as others, so just because &quot;you&quot; (non objective singular), can do it, doesn't mean others can do it the same way.<br />

Claiming people are &quot;doing it wrong&quot;, doesn't help either. It's offensive to those in question, questioning both their playstyle and abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Allow me to quote myself (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11549 in the comments):<br />
<br />
From Island, done on Island: 10 quests, 105 gold, 2200 reputation<br />
From Island, done in Outland: 2 quests, 27 gold, 600 reputation, 1 supplies (5-10g value)<br />
From Shattrath, done in Outland: 3 quests, 29 gold, 650 reputation, 2 supplies (10-20g value)<br />
From and done in Hellfire Peninsula: 2 quests, 22 gold, 500 reputation, 1 supplies (5-10g value)<br />
<br />
Total: 17 quests, 183 gold, 3950 reputation, 4 supplies (20-40g value)<br />
<br />
Additionally, for chars with gathering professions:<br />
<br />
From Shattrath, done in Outland: 1 quest, 16 gold, 250 reputation<br />
<br />
Of course this does not include money loots, drops etc. Also, if you're not yet exalted, you can pay 10g to complete a quest for extra 150 reputation.<br />
<br />
So the maximum SSO reputation from daily quests for miners/skinners/herbalists is 4350. The estimated maximum total gold gained from daily SSO quests for miners/skinners/herbalists is around 230g not including money loots and drops.<br />
<br />
The actual time you need to do them all varies greatly, from about 90 minutes for a non-gatherer epic-geared hunter with 280% flying mount who does them at night on a PvE server, to a good few hours for a holy priest in blues, on a slow flying mount, doing them at 7pm on a PvP server.</div></div><hr />

fucking hell.. I hate you kids.. lets do some maths..<br />
All the Quel'Danas quests net 104g.93s exactly not 170g.<br />
<br />
If I did do that on all 4 chars that nets me 419g72s ONE epic mount costs 5200g / 419g72s = 12 day of nothing but dailies for of my chars to get an epic mount.. and in 4 hours you reckon?<br />
<br />
My chars consist of a disc priest, a holy paladin, a prot warrior and a frost mage and I would truely LOVE to see somebody consistently complete all the QD quests in under 45mins on highly populated PvP server such as Zenedar with these toons at the times I play 6pm-10pm.<br />
<br />
And for christ sake why does everybody jump on this &quot;YOU MUST PLAY 24/7 AND BE IN THE TOP GUILD IN THE WORLD AND THE HIGHEST RATED TEAM IN THE WORLD JUST TO GET GREENS&quot; banwagon.<br />
<br />
All I'm trying to say is as someone who has leveled new chars recently and &quot;has alts to feed&quot; I feel that the cost of the epic mounts are out of pretty high and adding this extra 1000g charge to be able to use them in the xpack seems a little bit excessive.</div></div><hr />

Caps lock wont improve your &quot;point&quot;.<br />
<br />
There's 2 quests in BEM that take like 5 minutes, and 2 on SSO island which can be done in 10 minutes.<br />
Park a char or 2 there, and ignore the &quot;long&quot; quests. That way you can still grind whatever is more profitable with your dps char, and do the well paying quests on the other 3 for the best money-time investment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because you can't do these quests in a group, right?<br />
<br />
I'm a Rogue who does them all in less than one hour, and I gladly invite any healers who want to come and heal me in exchange for my stabbies doing their work. <br />
<br />
How does any healer or tanking class get the dailies done? Pay to respec and lose half your profit? Or make friends in game.. <br />
<br />
I can't quite figure out which one it is..<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that there's no excuse to not have money, and anyone who complains about the cash flow of today's WoW never played before TBC, or even early on in TBC when the only dailies that netted cash were ones you had to attune for.. and good luck attuning solo as a healer.. or any class for that matter..<br />
<br />
You don't have to have your cold weather flying the first day it comes out, y'know? Like the game is meant to drive people to play it to advance further within it - y'know, like, a video game would do?<br />
<br />
They massively buffed money and drops a few patches back - and it changed the way the game is played. People have more money to buy items, returning money back to the economy this way, in addition to having tons more dailies to do.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for easy money, there's still Skettis (easily soloable now), Hellfire dailies (non party kills still grow your ember), Ogri-la (bomb/wrangle/simon), and the QD dailies that aren't on the Myrmidon side of things.. the bombing runs, the gathering quests, the soon to be JC quests.. there's simply no excuse.. <br />
<br />
if you can't afford the time to grind money, then just grind it at a slower pace. Nobody's asking you to do it all, at once, immediately.<br />
<br />
It's a freakin' game, it shouldn't take over your life.. have fun doing it, and when the fun stops, quit the game.</div></div><hr />

But I do care for the questline. I've already seen some of it in a preview video and it looked fun. I don't get it: they take away a cool questline from the players AND take 1000g. If they just had a problem with the gold amount on live they could have just added the 1k to the quest.<br />
<br />
Oh and besides for all the crybabies: you do not NEED to have an epic mount. Normal speed mount and 1000g are perfectly affordable for every twink since that is still much less than the money you make by questing. I only bought epic mounts for my main and that one twink that is my ressource gatherer (herbs and mining). All other chars are fine with normal speed. And I have more than 14k on that server. I just decided its not worth to get all of them a mount.</div></div><hr />

so at a rate of 200g a day and give I need 19000g to get epic flyers on my 3 chars that dont have it and 1 char that needs the winter flying.<br />

Thats 95 days aka 3 months of doing nothing but 25 dailies every single day? given the fact I only play every other day or so I'm look at 6months of my game time spent doing dailys so that I can enjoy the fundiment mobility of the game? <br />

Nah, I have better things to do with my time like pvp, arenas leveling proffessions, 5 and 10 man instances. so looks like I simply won't be having a flying mount on any of my chars since the only char that does have it is an alt I dont really play much (prot paladin).<br />

<br />
<br />
If you cant make 100g per toon on dailies in about 30-45 min each, you suck at doing dailies. Do them all on Isle of Q, no travel time ever required. That's an epic flyer every 25-38 hours of play, however you carve that up into days. You can cry a lot or you can do a lot---your choice.</div></div><hr />

Also, the TCG mount does seem a little... meh? I do like that &quot;owned&quot; flag though, it should make for a few good laughs, whether the giver or receiver.

If you want the 170g, you have to venture out into Outlands to complete the Roots and Shadowmoon Valley ones.<br />
I'm not complaining about the 1000g cost, because relatively speaking, it's pretty cheap compared to the epic flyer.<br />
However, if you are sitting on tens of thousands of gold, you most-likely do nothing in the game but farm or play the AH game.<br />
Some of us raid and actively participate in the game, which makes one spend their gold.<br />
If doing the same repetitive gold grind hour in and hour out, day in and day out, is fun for you, then that's great. Some of us like a tad bit of variety and fun when playing a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
75 - costs 35g + mount 10g<br />
150 - costs 600g + mount 100g<br />
225 - costs 800g + mount 100g<br />
300 - costs 5000g + mount 200g<br />
this - costs 1000g<br />
<br />
total: 7845g<br />
<br />
I already have 4 level 70s soon to be 6 (doing RAF) and I've only been able to get a flying mount for one them so far! this just makes it even harder :@(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: doing the quests in SMV alone was worth over 1500g. How can you possibly expect to have a hard time collecting the 1000g between L70-77? Reality check required methinks</div></div><hr />

<br />
they alrdy have rings in Dalaran that costs 7,2k gold - why not keep it at that, instead of the &quot;you have to earn your frost wings&quot; its bullshit, and they know it. Its just a sad excuse to get some gold of the market, bunch of fucking retards in their dev dep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe they consider 1,000 g a trivial amount for an L77 toon.... like *most* of us already do for an L70 toon. I wouldn't even classify it as a gold divot, let alone a gold sink.</div></div><hr />

It just seems like a lazy solution to a gold accumulation problem and an annoying tax on people... in a video game. Yeah epic flying was expensive in BC, but it was something new. &quot;Well I see you've done a bunch of dailies for gold, here let us take away your last week and a half of playing so you can do something you've already experienced in BC.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am not sure what you want emulous.. at one post you say you dont want to spend gold to get mounts, then you spend all that gold powerleveling professions for your alts... <br />
<br />
if it takes you 3-4 hours to do 25 daily's on 1 toon, then you are obviously doing it wrong <br />
<br />
there are tonnes of guides, walkthru's and even mods that help you streamline the 25 dailys.. once you do a couple of rounds using these, it goes a lot faster.<br />
<br />
if you don't want to put in the effort, then maybe you don't deserve the prize.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you do dailies everyday? It's the most boring thing ever. 1.5 hours? No no no, try 4.5 mate.<br />
<br />
I laugh at how GC responded to the arms post saying they're fine in PvE. Honestly, he LOVES to avoid PvP questions and yet, PvP should have a lot more effort put into than PvE as it's so much tougher to balance.</div></div><hr />

For people who have not obtained it at the release of WotLK it is going to be an ever harder decision for them by the time they hit level 77 - &quot;Do I save up more money and buy Epic Flying and postpone Cold Weather Flying or do I buy C.W.F. now and go back to square one saving up for Epic Flying?&quot;. <br />
<br />
I personally feel there are enough time / gold sinks in WoW already. Epic Flying was really cool and only a small population was able to afford it early on in TBC which was their goal IMO. But at this time I think having an Epic Flier is something that should be as common as an Epic Land Mount was after TBC came out. <br />
<br />
This argument reminds me of the big outcry that occurred when Blizz removed most of the 'Key' requirements of high level dungeons in TBC. Basically the people who worked for them (me included) were not too happy that all their work was in vein and was no longer a status symbol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm suspecting it's a number of things, partly down to the way in which some of the later zones have been designed around the use of flying mounts. Because of this, they can't have the risk of a quest breaking. People would have needed to be able to get the quest easily for this exact same reason.<br />
<br />
As for they cost, they need some gold sinks to use up the thousands of gold everyone will get while leveling. They would have included this even if it were done as a quest. (this may be another reason why they're doing it straight from a vendor; 1000g is a little much to spend on a quest)</div></div><hr />

Also, someone already said the quest chain would cost 800g regarless, so why not pay 200g more to get it instantly? From a pvp standpoint, its much better than having to do a quest that everyone on the server is doing especially when you're outnumbered and would probably be killed constantly.<br />
<br />
From reading what the guy said who had the 4 lvl 70s, he could have been doing dailies each day he was lvling the alt.<br />
<br />
As far as how long it takes to do the dailies, I'm sure it varies from server to server whether its a high pop or low pop and whether it is a pve or pvp server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one don't mind paying a mere 1k gold for the ability to fly - have you I'd rather it just be a quest if it's still level capped @ 77.. but I trust Blizzard in their decisions, I mean they have done a great job so far. <br />
<br />
And yeah, I know, one toon at seventy? what a loser! I'm working on another =) I just found it hard to justify not gearing up my one main as best as I could.. and now that raiding is dead (where I come from) I have a few weeks to get a toon rollin'. Wish all my friends weren't already playing wow so we could level up 3x as fast.. weaksauce.<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually, in Beta you don't need to buy 300 riding skill to buy cold weather flying.<br />
<br />
I don't know wtf this quest was supposed to be, because on the 80 premade server, it's been 1000g from the vendor right from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify:<br />
You do NOT need an epic flier to buy cold weather flying. It requires ONLY 225 riding skill, and costs 1000g. You can fly on a slow mount in Northrend if you're level 77 and buy the cold weather thing.<br />
<br />
If you don't make 1000g each on every single one of those chars leveling it to 77, you fail.</div></div><hr />
