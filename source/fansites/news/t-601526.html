<br />
General<br />
Voice Chat - The new Voice Chat feature is now available in game. Players will need to go into the options menu under Sound &amp; Voice to activate it. Volume sliders are available for the microphone, speakers, and game-audio fade (which automatically lowers the game audio when a voice communication is received), as is a “push-to-talk” setting. Right-clicking on a player’s name now includes the option to mute or unmute that player. Muting another player blocks all voice chat from him or her; the ignore feature now blocks both voice chat and text chat from that player.<br />
Chat Channels- New Chat Channel controls and functionality are now available under the chat tab in the Social Window of the interface. The interface will now show the channels players are in or are available, depending on the area of the world they are in, along with new private channel controls.<br />
A new feature for reporting players as being AFK in battlegrounds by right clicking has been added. When enough reports are registered, a 30 second debuff will begin to count down. Once the timer is up a new debuff will appear that will prevent the player from gaining any honor while it is on. This debuff can be negated as soon as the player engages in combat.<br />
Resilience Rating: The reduction to the percent chance to get a critical strike now also reduces the damage dealt by damage over time effects by the same percentage.<br />
Daze: Defense skill will no longer reduce the chance players have to receive the Daze effect when attacked from behind by enemies.<br />
Corrected the damage modifier calculation for Resilience when the attacker has bonus critical strike damage.<br />
Power Regeneration: Any effect which triggers a change in your rate of power regeneration (Mana, Rage, Energy, Focus) will now cause an immediate reward of some power at the old rate of increase, and then begin new “ticks” of power at the new rate approximately 2 seconds later. This was done to improve functionality of abilities such as Evocation and Innervate so that they did not have wasted “ticks”.<br />
Mac Movie Capture: the Mac client can now capture in-game video to QuickTime movie files using a configurable choice of codec, resolution, and frame rate. Two new entries have been added to the Key Bindings dialog for start/stop recording and for cancellation of a recording. For more detailed configuration options please see the Mac Options panel in game. Mac OS X 10.4.9 and QuickTime 7.1.6 or better are required. Not all machines have enough performance to smoothly capture video at high frame rates; end user experimentation will be required to find appropriate settings for each system.<br />
Pets are now affected by Paladin greater blessings.<br />
Non-combat pets may not be selected as the target for spells or abilities.<br />
Non-combat pets now have the tag &quot;Companion&quot; instead of &quot;Minion&quot;.<br />
Being attacked by guardians, such as summoned Treants, will no longer automatically causes neutral guards to attack you.<br />
Meeting Stones can no longer be used to summon players that do not meet the level requirements.<br />
Damage and health leech effects always affect flying players even if they are immune to the rest of the spell’s affects while in flight.<br />
Dueling players may not use a Lightwell that they didn’t create themselves. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Arenas<br />
Items that are indicated as quest items in their tooltips and have a &quot;use&quot; or &quot;equip&quot; ability will not work in PvP arenas. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids<br />
Cat Form (Night Elf) melee attack range was too short compared to Tauren Cat Form and other attack ranges. It has been increased.<br />

Cyclone: Paladin Auras, Trueshot Aura, and Aspect of the Pack will now be automatically reactivated when Cyclone wears off of a victim who had one of the abilities active.<br />

Entangling Roots: It is no longer possible to have more than one rank of this spell active on a player.<br />

Aspect of the Pack: This ability will now cause party members to become dazed when struck while sitting.<br />
Aspect of the Viper: This ability has received a slight redesign. The amount of mana regained will increase as the Hunter’s percentage of mana remaining decreases. At about 60% mana, it is equivalent to the previous version of Aspect of the Viper. Below that margin, it is better (up to twice as much mana as the old version); while above that margin, it will be less effective. The mana regained never drops below 10% of intellect every 5 sec. or goes above 50% of intellect every 5 sec.<br />
Freezing Trap and Scare Beast duration against PvP targets has been reduced to 10 seconds.<br />
Hunter's Mark: The duration remaining graphic will now display properly for Hunter's Mark after it has been refreshed on a target, and will properly consume mana when recasting it to refresh its duration.<br />

Redoubt: This ability can now trigger while the Paladin is sitting.<br />
Reckoning: This ability can now trigger while the Paladin is sitting.<br />

Seal of Righteousness: The tooltip for this ability has been improved. It now displays a different number for one-handed weapons and two-handed weapons, and adjusts to the speed of your current weapon. It displays a single number, rather than a range of numbers for different handedness and speeds.<br />
Seal of Vengeance: The damage from this ability will now stack properly when two different characters are applying Seal of Vengeance effects to a target.<br />
Seal of Vengeance duration increased to 15 seconds. In addition, when Seal of Vengeance strikes a target that already has 5 applications you will cause instant Holy damage. <br />

<br />
I think you just answered your own point there. Affliction locks do completely rely on dots, and do not have the burst damage of other pvp specs. It takes 30 seconds for some of the dots to tick out as much damage as 1 frostbolt or auto attack crit from an arms warrior. Yes, the cumulative effect of all dots ticking is quite a bit of damage, over 20 or so seconds, but no more than what most PvP damage specs can do to you in 1/2 that time.<br />
<br />
This nerf is directly as a result of crying about dots ticking after the lock has died or gone out of range. The problem isn't the damage dots do, its the fact that people cant run away from them.</div></div><hr />

Why don't we just nerf everything and leave you with a pwning class.<br />
<br />
Sheesh warrior nerf, that's rich<br />
<br />
Also, could anybody please clarify this for me? &quot;Merciless Gladiator&#8217;s Legguards: This item now appears as a kilt.<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
Thx<br />

I don't know what the Merciless Legguards change means, but you do not think that warriors are OP in 5v5 compared to rogue? Being able to switch around and stun targets with ease with Intercept. Rogues cannot switch targets; they lose Combo Points and they don't have a 25-yard warp move to their opponent that stuns them as well. I'm not saying to give Intercept to Rogues, but I'm pointing out the main reason Rogues are inferior to Warriors in 5v5. Many have been suggesting a shorter duration sprint with a shorter cooldown, perhaps giving them snare immunity for the duration with talents. Warriors also have superior burst as well as sustained. Think about what a rogue has to do to get a 5k burst on enemies. Now look at a warrior, MS crit + white crit, done with ease. MS cannot be removed by a party member, Wound Poison can. Stunlocking on par, and sometimes superior to, Rogues with Mace Specialization, BS Mace, Intercept.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the moment, Rogues, Druids, and Hunters are the three most underrepresented classes in 5v5. You will find that Warlocks, Warriors, Paladins, and Priests are the four most highly represented classes in the Arenas. In this patch, with the resilience changes, warlocks and shadow priests got nerfed by resilience (but IMHO this was coming, but I don't see why they don't implement the gear swapping fix this patch as well), and Paladins got their utility Blessings nerfed. <br />
<br />
Hunter is the most underrepresented in ALL Arenas, and so are Druids in 3v3 and 5v5.<br />
<br />
Hunters, Druids, and Rogues need tweaking in PVP, whether that be to solely buff them, or to both buff them and give other classes nerfs.</div></div><hr />

In all honestly the Rogue class is pretty much as balanced as the mage class, however these 1 min CC buffs are getting retarded. CloS was annoying enough on 1min but Blind now too?<br />
<br />
And Druids are absolutely fine, they are small arena numbers because not a lot of people play them, but a good Druid owns no matter what he's doing. Same with hunters, just A LOT of hunters suck.<br />
<br />
Priests are well represented in Arenas but that doesn't mean they're fine. They are in DIRE need of PvP buffs, the reason they are well represented is because of their def/off dispelling and syngergy with shadow, that's it.<br />
<br />
Do warriors need a nerf? Definitly. Hamstring needs a cooldown and MS needs diminishing returns.<br />
But giving Rogues more buffs is gonna turn them into the flavour of the month like Locks are right now.<br />
<br />
Once again, being underrepresented doesn't mean the class is broken.<br />
<br />
Take note if you come across a good hunter/druid/rogue in an arena and tell me if they need help.</div></div><hr />

But it is an indication that changes are needed, and merits investigation by the developers. Take Ret pallies or sub rogues for example. You will not see either in raids or high-end pvp (5v5 arena) either, although supposedly Subtlety is the Rogue PvP tree.<br />
<br />
Resto Druids and Rogues are excellent in 2v2 and 3v3. However they blow at 5v5, no way around it. <br />
<br />
Rejuv and Lifebloom with Swiftmend work well to keep a partner up in 2v2 and 3v3 because you aren't facing as much dps, however they just won't hold up in 5v5. Also a common strat for druids is to run away if focused, because they run very fast in travel form with the PvP set bonus. That simply doesn't work in 5v5, and there is really nothing a druid can do about that. The slow cast time on HT and high mana cost of Regrowth make healing 5v5 very tough for druids. <br />
<br />
Cyclone is obviously much more effective in the lower volume arenas just because the significance of losing one player in those arenas is greater than the significance of one player in 5v5. Beyond Cyclone, a resto druid does not bring anything substantive to the table in 5v5, anything that other healer classes cannot do. They also don't have any great utilities such as Paladin Blessings, DS, HOJ, or Priest ProM, Mass Dispel, PWS, or SoR. Sure there is Innervate, but any 5v5 team will immediately purge that off.<br />
<br />
And as for rogues, I already spoke of the superiority of Warriors over Rogues in 5v5. Honestly, there is no good 5v5 team where I would rather have a Rogue over a Warrior. In the first 30 seconds of combat, Rogue is about on par with Warrior because of his cooldowns. After the first 30 seconds of combat, the gap between Warrior/Rogue only widens, due to Rogue poor sustained damage compared to Warriors'.<br />
<br />
Concerning 1min blind, it lasts 8 seconds, breaks on damage, and can be cleansed as well as trinketed. Look at HoJ, it has the same properties, except it lasts 6 seconds not 8, and it does not break on damage. It's a big 2v2 and 3v3 buff, but I don't see much changing for Rogues in 5v5.<br />
<br />
Priests need a buff to their Holy tree, yes, but I don't know how much the resilience changes hurt Shadow. 27/34 Priests seem to be all the rage these days.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the laugh, I'll find 2300 rated Hunters in 5v5 with consistency right after I go and solo BT.</div></div><hr />

Still trying to find out if the mats on the aq enchants have changed, but since they require the same enchanting skill as the old ones, i guess they are the same.</div></div><hr />

I really should have read the patch notes more carefully...<br />
Any updates on the required mats then? I hope the copy of my enchanter goes through soon.</div></div><hr />

or unflagged rogues who sap become flagged. one of the most annoying things in game, and one of the only things that a lowbie can do to a lvl 70 character.</div></div><hr />

Added a recipe for Steady Dawnstone to the Halaa vendors. This new recipe requires Halaa Research Tokens to purchase and creates a superior green gem that grants Resilience and Stamina. <br />

Anyone know the stats for the gem and how many Research Tokens it'll cost?</div></div><hr />
