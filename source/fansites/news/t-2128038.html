<br />
The increase to MG allows for a boatload of gaming that I'm excited to try out.<br />
<br />
You're not out of the woods as far as I'm concerned blizzard with how you've forsaken affliction warlock players for so long, but this instills massive amounts of hope and it's a grand step into greener pastures. <br />
<br />
Well done. <br />
<br />
Please remove the shard cost from seeds.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, Empower Lifetap is getting much better, best iteration yet, i don't see us capping mana much if at all now. <br />

<br />
I think I actually prefer it that way. Playing around with it on the PTR (where it does, indeed, have a shard cost, though StS no longer does), it actually feels more fluid with the shard cost. AoE rotation becomes keep up Agony on 3+ targets -&gt; spam Seed while you have shards (your DoT ticks will burst it almost instantly) -&gt; drain when you have no shards (which doesn't last long at all). I was maintaining ~625k AoE DPS over a 6 minute combat session on 4 targets with StS + 880 ilevel and an 880 weapon with 23 traits purchased (the entire upper crescent from the right gold to the top left to the bottom left, and no others). Damage breakdown: http://puu.sh/sFMBD/80f40ec3ea.png<br />
<br />
By comparison, on live in roughly the same gear, I was able to maintain only about 410k against 4 targets with StS and 360k without (by largely foregoing SoC and using spread UAs instead). So not only does this improve the AoE rotation in terms of intuitive flow, it also represents a significant increase to AoE DPS.<br />
<br />
By tooltip on the PTR, UA does 240,644 damage (combat log confirmed, 4 ticks of 60,161), and Seed does 89,411 per target (on average, it has a damage range like most direct damage effects). This means that Seed is better than UA as a shard consumer at 3+ targets baseline. Artifact traits and talents can obviously affect this. Contagion increases the threshold to 4+ targets. Sow the Seeds makes Seed better at 2+ (even with Contagion), with Seed dealing around triple the damage per shard as UA against 3 targets.<br />
<br />
All in all, though, the change makes sense. Demo has a filler replacement during AoE, and Destro has a consumer replacement during AoE. Seed currently doesn't really fit either of those definitions, since you still need to keep Agony up to generate the shards. Making it a consumer thus pushes it to the Destro style, where AoE becomes &quot;keep up resource-generating DoTs -&gt; spend shards on AoE ability&quot;. On a side note, it also drastically decreases the frequency with which you need to Life Tap during sustained AoE, since you spend a LOT of time casting Seed, and it lost its mana cost when it gained the shard cast.<br />
<br />
EDIT: just tested it on PTR, and there's been another change to SoC that didn't make the tooltip: if you cast SoC on a target already afflicted by SoC, the SoC will instead apply to a random target without SoC that's within the explosion radius from your first target, if any exist without SoC. If all targets have SoC, it'll just recast (and overwrite) on your current target, but you can spam SoC on an AoE group before you have your DoTs up and every cast will hit a different target, so the initial explosion is substantially more significant, and you don't have to manually tab target to avoid overwriting.<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: tested against live, and this behavior is present there as well, so it's not new to 7.1.5. I feel like it wasn't present in 7.0, however, so maybe it was stealth added in 7.1?</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to believe that you know how to properly balance, and that this isn't final, but what was even the point of this? It's like having a bar that only certain classes can reach, making boomkins spin a wheel and hope it lands on a pair of stilts, and then cutting those stilts in half so that the bar is now impossible to reach. It doesn't make the other boomkin legendaries look better. It only makes dreamcatcher look worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your comparisons are a bit weird. Yes, Seed does more damage, that's obvious from the change. So even if everything else is equal it should be doing about 30% more dps.<br />
The shard change I don't like much. Even on live you should be keeping several Agonies going for shards for StS. The difference the shard cost makes is that you can't spam Seeds while waiting for shard procs but need to wait to start casting till you get a proc. Right now on live I can chain multiple seeds and hope that in the 2 sec cast of Seed a proc will happen. On PTR you will have moments during AE where you need to shoot single target fillers instead of actually AEing. <br />
On fights with AE waves this means you will have to keep a shard in reserve and not burn them all on UA's.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are they continuing to buff Fire bracers?<br />
It's 300% on Live. It used to be 200% on beta but was deemed too low. Right now on PTR they seem to test different values to find the balance between useful and OP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but every UA you fire will do ~56% more damage than on live, so even with downtime, the sustained AoE is superior. And honestly, from testing, the shard income from 3+ Agonies keeps up with your casting of Seed, especially accounting for the downtime as you refresh all of those Agonies every ~18 seconds. Even against 5+ targets, the damage of the PTR version is within about 6% of the current damage-per-cast on Live, except you get that same damage as low as 3 targets now. And again, keep in mind that the shard cost comes in exchange for the mana cost, drastically decreasing the wasted GCDs spent casting Life Tap during sustained AoE. This change also moves non-StS builds away from a spread-UA AoE strategy, as at 3+, Seed is a better use of the shards anyway. Overall, it's a substantial buff to AoE without StS (making it far less required in AoE situations), and a moderate buff to AoE with StS, particularly in 3 or 4 target situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bracers are broken in the current build of the game because the long cast cannot be interrupted due to icy floes. <br />
<br />
In the future the bracers will require you to plant for 4+ seconds in order to use them. You cannot guarantee that this is possible, mechanics happen frequently. Breaking that cast causing a HUGE downtime of not casting which is in turn a MASSIVE dps loss. Currently I would say I use icy floes with the bracers on 50% of hard cast pyros.<br />
<br />
The bracers dont need to be nerfed and will not be overpowered anymore because the conditions of the game have changed. The risk reward scenario has changed from heavily favored reward to heavily favored risk.</div></div><hr />

Also they need to push the 20% increased healing back down to 10%, or at least 15%. The overhealing part is broken AF already and the fact that this is not a on-proc but a 'on use' means its going to be one of the strongest healing cooldowns possible for every healing spec.

<br />
Fire mages are going crap, frost mages going crap, arcane mages not so crap but now they are nerfing them with that mana cost increase... balance druid too, hunters and every other dps class are crying.... so do you think blizzard come here and read this coments? I don't think so... they only listen to some people that are on tops guild on the game, the rest are not....<br />
<br />
Maybe i should think on a reroll class and play with aff lock.... everybody go for it, so maybe with that blizz see this and change some the spect and put a little nerf to them...<br />
<br />
I really don't know what are they thinking about this changes but is clearly that they are on preferences of affliction warlock.... the rest are going to be companion on next raid.....</div></div><hr />

If they did then it would mean they failed at coming up with a game play for BM hunters, we as players are not game devs an so if they admitted they failed it would mean they are just as humans as the rest of us. Other wise i personally think they just dont give a shit what arm chair testers think. we are not famous or in top guilds so there for our input dont mean shit.</div></div><hr />

I would imagine it is the new style from blizzard :)</div></div><hr />

Crit will be gutted anyway in the patch. ( stat changes, -5%base crit) And if i am not wrong 2 out of 3 specs don't really need haste at all. This change looks so pointless.<br />
Well, what I think might be bullshit but I guess logic behind that is: &quot;If they wear it for 100% crit chance, why having crit chance on it as it will be wasted stat&quot;<br />
I'm not saying it's relevant reason, haste is absolute crap stat for every spec I'm just trying to understand some changes</div></div><hr />

It's been the same damn thing for a decade, it's never been a broken ability or something that gave Warriors a serious advantage. What a joke. Then the slap in the face to make it a full on talent change to switch it to a stun, not just a PvP talent. What will we have to give up? Mortal Combo in exchange for a Charge stun?</div></div><hr />

Верните Рывку стан ветке Оружие и Неистовство им больше необходим и эффектнее будет у них<br />

I'm so glad I put this through Google Translate:<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not understand why the camp was taken at jerks and made the slowdown in the branch Weapons Warriors and Fury, and then gave Jerk with pitched Tank branch, the question is: who stun Tank jerk bosses in dungeons and in raids? Return jerk camp branch Arms and Fury them more necessary and more effective to have them.<br />

In general, the Warriors branch Weapons must increase the survival and to make a separate class that would be playable class, not only 3 by 3 and 2 more on the 2 in the arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Warbringer (Arms, Fury) Charge now deals [ 108% of AP ] damage to all enemies within 5 yds of the target, and stuns them for 2.5 sec. until cancelled.&quot; - What does this mean exactly? Until I hit them again they're stunned indefinitely? Also...this is clearly just a Prot spec talent, so why is it listed under Arms,Fury....?<br />
<br />
Also..<br />
<br />
&quot;...War Banner You throw down a war banner at your feet, rallying your allies. Increases movement speed by 30% and reduces the duration of all incoming crowd control effects by 50% to all allies within 40 0 yards of the war banner. Lasts 15 sec. Arms Warrior - Tier 4 PvP Talent. Instant. 1.5 min cooldown...&quot; - Why would they update this to have a zero yard radius...must be missing a number there guys...</div></div><hr />

They don't seem to care if it's top end raiders either. There's been some pretty detailed feedback from the top of the top including detailed discussions on podcasts on top of forum feedback. I think you probably nailed it on they just don't want to admit they dropped the ball on that spec. <br />
<br />
I played it for 10 years even when it was considered the worst simply because I enjoyed it. I only swapped when absolutely necessary for progression. But, I just can't stand how utterly slow and dull they've made it now.</div></div><hr />
