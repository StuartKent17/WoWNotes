<br />
The Warcraft Secrets guide (https://warcraft-secrets.com/the-hivemind-secret-mount-progress/) has a handy script to keep track of your progress: /run local N,t={&quot;SCROLL&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;9&quot;,&quot;10&quot;,&quot;11&quot;,&quot;12&quot;,&quot;FIN&quot;},{52819,52809,52810,52818,52817,52816,52815,52814,52813,52812,53632,53633,53634,52827}for s,k in pairs(N)do d=IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(t[s])print(k,&quot;=&quot;,d and &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;N&quot;)end<br />
A few locations are easier with a Goblin Glider, and one requires some sort of slow fall.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Scroll<br />
<br />
Head to Heart of Darkness in Nazmir. Start at the bridge at 46,54 that is in the Blood Troll area to get to the middle structure. <br />
Once at the top of the Heart of Darkness, you need to carefully jump down the outside edge to click on the note at 51, 59.<br />
If you are having trouble getting to the note (https://www.wowdb.com/objects/293849-conspicious-note#model-viewer), a Goblin Glider (https://www.wowdb.com/items/109076-goblin-glider-kit) may be helpful.<br />

<br />
Pebble One<br />
<br />
Head to The Broken Shore, at 37.45, 71.63 and click on the light grey pebble on the table near Dark'thul.<br />

<br />
<br />
Pebble Two<br />

<br />
<br />
Pebble Three<br />
<br />
Head to Atal'dazar, Zuldazar<br />
From the flight path, take the road up towards the dungeon portal. Take a right to the road that goes up the mountain right before the portal.<br />
Follow this road north until you see a large flat stone surface and the waterfall. Go through the small arch on the right towards the waterfall.<br />
Continue along the path behind the waterfall, then across the rocks on the waterfall, down to a corner of the temple structure and grass. Repeatedly jump up that way, go forward and then up the side of the mountain.<br />
Use a glider or some slow fall to head down into the valley and the cave at the bottom.<br />
The pebble is located at the to the left of the large stone column right after entering, behind the tree branch. <br />

<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS06.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS06.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

Go out to the edge of fatigue and head towards 54, 7 in the Zandalar map. You'll need to get there quickly, then use a swim speed buff to click the pebble before dying. <br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS08.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS08.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS09.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS09.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pebble Nine<br />
Go to 18, 7 in Drustvar to take the path to a cave. The pebble is on the top of the large rock outside.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS10.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS10.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pebble Ten<br />
<br />
Head to 75, 70 in Tirigarde Sound with some invisibility potions. Enter the cave, use the potion, and get the pebble. The screenshot below is facing into the cave, so walk in and look behind some rocks halfway back to the left.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS11.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS11.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pebble Eleven<br />
<br />
Head to 80, 19 in Tirigarde Sound and look for the waterfall. You'll need to head up and then jump down on to some rocks to access the cave behind the waterfall.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS12.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS12.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pebble Twelve<br />
<br />
Head to 10, 82 in Tirigarde Sound, enter the hidden cave, head to the rocks on the right, and move your camera around until you can see the pebble.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS13.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS13.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pebble Thirteen<br />
<br />
Head to 63, 21 in Vol'dun (Tortaka Refuge) with water walking potions or a Water Strider then set a waypoint for Zandalar 45.78 -3.34. <br />

The pebble is close to the cave entrance near some rocks on the right when facing the entrance from the inside. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/THS14.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/THS14.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Baa’l and Uuna<br />
<br />
Head to 62, 22 in Frostfire Ridge and defeat Baa'l after weakening him.<br />
You either need to have Uuna (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uuna%27s_Doll) or someone with an upgraded Uuna needs to have the summon active nearby to weaken Baa'l. <br />
Baa'l can get into a bugged state where Unna won't be able to weaken him. Gastropod Shell (https://www.wowdb.com/items/98136-gastropod-shell) will reset him and fix this.<br />
This rewards Baa'ls Darksign (https://www.wowdb.com/items/162578-baals-darksign)<br />
It isn't clear if this is the end of the secret or not.<br />
<br />

1. scanning world pixel by pixel for things you can click on, Even if you find them, you cant know the order to click, Making it 12 items to click in the right oder thats nearly impossible to find out by trial and error<br />

2. how would someone know a random toy from 3 addons ago triggers something? Doesnt make any sense. You cant trial and error 300 toys on some random NPC, and then know what to do afterwards<br />

Yeah i think they get at least the smallest hint, like where to start or something. There is no logical connection between these things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's the only thing I really dislike about this. If it was a logical riddle which you could solve by thinking about the hints you get, I'd be a lot happier. (like the quests in Secret World)<br />
The approach we have here with a bit of data mining and a high number of people searching the world to discover such things isn't a way I would go as a company. <br />
But respect to the people who work on finding this stuff.</div></div><hr />

farmed her on three characters before they added the secret.<br />

If it was a logical riddle which you could solve by thinking about the hints you get, I'd be a lot happier. (like the quests in Secret World)<br />
The approach we have here with a bit of data mining and a high number of people searching the world to discover such things isn't a way I would go as a company. <br />
But respect to the people who work on finding this stuff.<br />

Perhaps with SG-SG1 there is a Baa'l or whats the name of Goa'uld Lord and Unas that developed on the same planet as Goa'ulds</div></div><hr />

It doesnt make any sense to me. Even if one million people would &quot;scan the entire world, pixel by pixel, the chances are going to 0,0%. I cant believe in this can work, without some insider who works at Blizzard gives &quot;clues&quot;. Or there is a way to hack the game files and scan inside for information or coordinates or hack out routines you have to use and click in what order ect.<br />
<br />
1. scanning world pixel by pixel for things you can click on, Even if you find them, you cant know the order to click, Making it 12 items to click in the right oder thats nearly impossible to find out by trial and error<br />
<br />
2. how would someone know a random toy from 3 addons ago triggers something? Doesnt make any sense. You cant trial and error 300 toys on some random NPC, and then know what to do afterwards<br />
<br />
3.Where does this Baa’l NPC come from, is it new or was it always in Frostfire Ridge?<br />
<br />
... what the heck is an upgraded Uuna? ...<br />

We found all these hidden caves during the first BfA week.<br />
Then, yesterday, when people were running around looking for clues(we are basically scouting all BfA zones and even old zones 24/7 for clues and new items/npcs/etc) and visiting these places again, they noticed a lot of pebbles on the ground everywhere that were not there before. These pebbles don't really stand out in a normal setting, but since they are light and the other texture where they are in a lot of these places is dark, they do stand out. There were also a lot of them added to some caves, so they were hard to miss. Had these pebbles been there from the expansion release we wouldn't have noticed them as easily.<br />
It seems like Blizzard either wanted to wait a week so people could have a chance to level up a character to max level, or it was bugged so they had to hotfix the clues.<br />
Then someone noticed a lot of pebble entries in the Wowhead database and that they were cached - and also a note that had a similar name of the note that started the Lucid Nightmare riddle - and this note some people had cached aswell.<br />
<br />
So we had one guy clear his cache and then backtrack to all the places he had been since he logged in for that session until the note got cached again. He noticed it got cached in the area of the Heart of Darkness, so more people went there to look for the note, and then we found it. The note took us back to the NPC that started the whole Kosumoth secret and there we found the first pebble. From that point it was just a matter of finding the rest of the pebbles, so we spread out and checked all those hidden caves with pebbles on the ground again and here we are! :)<br />

Kosumoth wasn't too bad because of the Emerald Winds toy and using gliders to get around to the orb locations after getting off a high up FP. The Long-Forgotten Hippogryph on the other hand was far worse in my opinion</div></div><hr />

Kill him. He's laughably easy (if you get Uuna to work, otherwise impossible). Every single L25 pet will be able to solo him.<br />

Did this today, what a ride. Hell, how do you find those pebbles deep in the ocean behind two fatigue walls? That must have caused tens of thousands of character deaths. Respect to the perseverance of the dischord people. Chapeau.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the discord we compared the message across all languages and noticed the phrase &quot;get back to work&quot; was common as an anagram in all of them. With the remaining letters we were able to find the name of an NPC called Kurgthuk the Merciless who yells &quot;get back to work&quot; when you engage him, and Baa'l was found near this NPC.</div></div><hr />

Pardon me, but that is not the slighest believable. Even more if you look at the new &quot;&quot;&quot;find&quot;&quot;&quot; with Part 2 and the &quot;Waste of Time&quot; cosmetic. It is not, that step a leads to b leads to c with informaiton from the game or a puzzle. It is just random, totally random, no way to find it out if you dont have an insider developer who shares the information, or if you can hack the game files, and &quot;data mine&quot; for example x y coordinates of stuff and can put them together. You can know, that you have to buy random items and have them in your inventory, then go to some random place with no knowledge this could maybe be a place related, then collect random stuff and do random stuff n and z. I am sure there might be some clues how you can put it together, but how the guide is written, it just looks not believable. For example the scripts to check if you have clicked items, how would you know they exist with some random 23989298 quest number? It must be in the game files you can extract somehow, no? You just cant know, there at some random old game location in the whole WoW world lays a 2x2 pixel sided orb, stone, pebble, note, or whatever, you click.</div></div><hr />

I don't have Uuna and I got him!! I don't even have a water walking mount.. Just find someone that has an upgraded Uuna, or alternatively, once you have the pebbles part taken care of, hang around Baa'l until someone with a good Uuna shows up. That's how it worked out for me :) Well that and some good water walking pots lol<br />

<br />
Took us a long time to figure it out.<br />
Eventually someone saw that we could get the sentence &quot;Get back to work&quot; out of those words and that this also worked out in other languages, so we knew it was a key to the next step. So people started looking at places that have peons and search Wowpedia and WoWhead for NPCs that could be related to this. Eventually we found a NPC that also would fit in the anagram words from the last pebble.<br />
<br />
Everyone rushed to that NPC in Frostfire Ridge to kill him hoping for the next clue, but he didn't drop anything. But at the same time someone found Baa'l in the lava pool near the NPC, so we figured that was the reward + next step.<br />

<br />
Maybe I'm misunderstanding some of the things you write, but I'm gonna try to answer.<br />
<br />
These things are found using different methods.<br />
About knowing the quests and their quest numbers; some people are datamining and then sharing potentional quests and items that they think are part of the secret with everyone else in the Discord. We don't know for sure if they are correct at first, but they usually are. Usually the quests for these clues/items are added in a line(xxx240, xxx241, xxx242, xxx243, etc).<br />
For example 1 player datamined that a bunch of tailoring items and some grey vendor weapons were tied as criterias for a quest. We didn't know if this was connected to this secret, another secret or any secret at all - but it would be weird if it was tied to a &quot;normal&quot; quest and not a secret quest and we've had this type of step as part of another secret before, so it wasn't far fetched to assume it would be eventually.<br />
<br />
About the macro: I don't know how to write macros myself, and most people don't - but some people do. It's kind of like coding afaik, so that's how we get these long macros to check if we've done a certain critera/quest in the secret chain.<br />
<br />
I was asleep when someone found the clue in Spires of Arak, so I'm not completely sure how it went down. We were stuck on that part of the secret for a very long time, so we had pretty much searched any place we could think of that we thought would be connected to &quot;Seek Knowledge&quot;.<br />
The arakkoa are in a way tied to knowledge, so it was a matter of scouting the place and mousing over every spot you could think of in hopes of something being interactable. I don't know who found it and what made them look there unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Datamining is not &quot;hacking the game files&quot;. You may not agree with the method and think it shouldn't be used to find things added to the game(or atleast not when figuring out secrets), but it isn't hacking. Also; Blizzard assume the Secrets Discord is going to use datamined information, so they form the secrets around that. You can not datamine coordinates.<br />
Several people, myself included, crafted or bought these crafting tailoring items and bought the grey weapon and then used them while searching for clues just in case.<br />
<br />
The items found in old world locations have text clues that you can see when you click the items. The text don't make sense because they are anagrams. Figure out the anagram and then look at locations you think it might refer to.<br />
We haven't had this problem before(yes, I personally think it's a problem) for any of the other secrets, but for this secret it was a big problem: A lot of people in the discord used the Wowhead Client to find the items after Baa'l. We figure out the anagram to get clues where to search next, but then people use the client to see when the next item gets cached to narrow down where it is instead of only searching for it &quot;manually&quot;. This is something I personally dislike a lot, and it has made it so that I don't look forward to the next secret. Unfortunately I seem to be one of extremely few in the discord that think this way, so people are going to keep using this method in the future. I personally only think it's ok if you are stuck on a clue for a very long time.<br />
<br />
The guides generally don't mention how we figured out these things. It would make the guides longer, and most people checking the guides don't really care how we figured things out, they just want the reward attached to the secret.<br />
<br />
Last but not least I want to say that I think you are underestimating the power of hundreds and even thousands of players searching the world(of Warcraft).</div></div><hr />
