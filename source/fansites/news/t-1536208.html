The gaze of the Black Prince (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161780-gaze-of-the-black-prince) had been both blessing and curse to her once upon a time. Her journey long and arduous, the blood of the enemy stained her boots. Now she stood on the corpse of the vanquished Fire God – Ordos – her cloak whipping about her frame and victory beating within her heart. Her journey was at an end. But as with any end, there is always another beginning ‘round the bend.<br />
<br />
To be legendary, one must obtain– a truly legendary cloak. What hero is hero without one? To help you on your danger fraught quest, the infamous Black Prince would grant you a boon to help make the journey toward adorning your own cloak a little easier. Will you follow in the footsteps of heroes that have come before and brave the challenge?<br />
<br />
Beginning Tuesday, June 17 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, through Monday, June 30 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, we’ll be applying the Gaze of the Black Prince (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161780-gaze-of-the-black-prince) buff which will increase the reputation gained with the Black Prince by 100%. It will also increase the chance of obtaining items from his foes needed as a part of the Legendary Cloak quest line including: the Secrets of the Empire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94593-secrets-of-the-empire), Sigil of Wisdom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209-sigil-of-wisdom), Sigil of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208-sigil-of-power), or Titan Runestone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94594-titan-runestone).</div></div><hr />

Had feeling that way hardly going to stay that way. I am also sure they did not envision the cloak to used as a tool to further gate people from content either. The thing is so OP, not sure how they did not see the gating coming. Anyway good luck to those that don't have it yet.</div></div><hr />

I just started the Test of Valor on two characters that I actually wanted to gear up. Guess I'll use it to farm sigils on my other two that still need the cloak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point just have this buff active in all MoP content going forward and remove the &quot;Test of Valor&quot; step or change it to something more meaningful. Who really cares about SoO gear progression at this point, really? This way more toons can get into SoO normals/heroics and more people can enjoy the content before WoD comes out.</div></div><hr />

They will be applying it between the stated times. Meaning that your realm could have it applied on one of the mentioned days - not that the buff only lasts that long.<br />

<br />
Grind some Heroic Scenarios, make a quick circuit down in Isle of Thunder for rares and convert Timeless Coins over to VP. You will be able to get that final 650 knocked out fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Literally ends on when my alt finishes test of valor. Awesome.<br />
<br />
I am also in the same boat, I am a little peeved about getting left out on the fun, but whatever. I already set a target date for getting my cloak without accounting for this stupid buff in my plans.<br />
<br />
We all knew this thing was coming, but to drop this on players with such short notice of time schedule for the buff was a slap in the face for many of us.</div></div><hr />

It's just beneficial. The only class that typically has it even remotely as a requirement is tanks. Everyone else can get by without it.<br />
<br />
Uhh.. It's a requirement because the community has generally deemed it so. A lot of top end guilds won't take raiders without it because it's so easy to get and proves you've been playing the game quite awhile.</div></div><hr />

THE BUFF IS NOT TIMED.<br />
They will be applying it between the stated times. Meaning that your realm could have it applied on one of the mentioned days - not that the buff only lasts that long.<br />
Im honestly surprised that not a SINGLE person considered this, everyone just jumped on the &quot;Omg bad decision blizz gg&quot; train.<br />
<br />
It means exactly what they're saying, the buff is applied June 17 and lasts through June 30, that's called a time limited buff. When the last mentioned date is past the buff is gone.</div></div><hr />

I really should have predicted this, what with 3 weeks of double valor (to help people through that phase) and then this buff coming up. <br />
<br />
I just wish they'd give more than a couple of days notice about these buffs so people can prep to use them optimally. If I'd known about the valor boost, I'd have pushed to get all my alts sigils the week before it dropped so capping them all each week would be meaningful for something other than upgrades.</div></div><hr />

All 3 of those required high end raiding at the time for each component and were rare because of such requirement.<br />

Top end guilds represent a small fraction of the raiding population. There are plenty of groups that take non-legendary players provided they've put in the effort to gear up otherwise.<br />

If you were worried about finishing your legendary you would have grinded that valor already. It's not like capping takes a long time... The reason the phase takes a while is because they force you to take 3 weeks minimum to complete it. If you take longer than that you have reason to complain.<br />
<br />
If you just reached that phase I can understand the frustration. That being said, we're at the end of the expansion and you've had more than enough time to finish cloaks. I know more than one person with 5+ cloaks. Why is it so impossible for you to finish one?</div></div><hr />

How so are they a requirement? Sure Free 50k dps is nice and all but you can't pull high numbers without the cape? Full normal geared w/o the cape any class played decently pulls over 200k.</div></div><hr />

dosent matter if you do 200k dps if you dont have the legendary cape. most people wont even bother taking you with them if you dont have it.<br />

Glad I'm not on your realm. I know people and have some that raid with us that don't have cloak and they can pull higher numbers then some people with cloak. It's mostly how well you know how to play your class. You can give everyone right now in WoW max ilvl and only the people who know how to play the class will get the best out of it.</div></div><hr />

App to any guild worth anything and have fun having your app declined as soon as they get to your armory and find out you don't have it.<br />

Dragonwrath was required if you were in a progression guild. I'd argue the cloak is an even bigger requirement given that you can even get it through LFR.</div></div><hr />

The cloak just takes time and jumping into LFR. It's the easiest &quot;legendary&quot; to get by a mile.<br />
<br />
Granted they were much more difficult to obtain, I only ever saw about half a dozen Fragments in my time spent in Ulduar back in WoTLK. <br />
<br />
Welfare implies though that that they are just given without much work on the players part, much like ilvl 496 Timeless gear tokens. &quot;lolz, hey guyz, click on this chest for free epic lootz!<br />
<br />
The time involvement is still there, much like Hyjal and BT attunement was in TBC.<br />
<br />
Edit: At any rate this buff will make going through ToT 1 for players seeking Secrets more tolerable over the next two weeks, it's pretty sad when the LFR group wipes on trash on the bridge this late in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Time doesn't mean much when the quests themselves can be done in LFR, which lets be honest is basically raiding on easy mode.<br />
<br />
Now, if they had made the drops only available in Flex/Normal/Heroic then there would probably be far less people calling them welfare.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard had commented previously that they wanted people to have the leg. cloak before WoD. If you plot out the timeline from when the lv 90 Boost were made available then plot the VP buff and now the drop rate buff, we can see those newly boosted toons obtain their cloaks as well.<br />
<br />
Speculating that the increase drop for Heirlooms will come after the drop rate buff so that people will have both the leg. cloak and Gary heirlooms for Warlords.<br />
<br />
Now I just can't quite remember if the heirloom drop increase is before or after 6.0 patch. If after, then WoD might be closer than we think! (Then again maybe not).<br />

However, this is all just my speculation.</div></div><hr />

Legendary has NEVER been &quot;legendary&quot; in the terms you seem to be implying; there is no accomplisment in beating RNG or being a guild officer.<br />

With MoP's at least you had to be diligent and consistently chip away at it if you wanted it; you had to put some effort into it as opposed to being granted it by a guild or winning a roll.<br />

Nerf the damn test of valor<br />
<br />
They already did nerf the damn test. Would you rather it was 6k valor up until now so they could have nerfed it to make you happy?<br />
<br />
People need to stop thinking they're entitled to a cloak because they pay $15 and go through the questline. If these boosts help you smile, if they don't keep working and you'll still be finished before WoD in November/December.</div></div><hr />

Now, if they had made the drops only available in Flex/Normal/Heroic then there would probably be far less people calling them welfare.<br />

Aye, I was kind of bummed to see players ignoring a lot of the boss mechanics, even though they are not lethal, it seems like great practice before moving on to higher modes of content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm more than aware that valor has a weekly cap. What's your point? You're whining that you can't use a buff that's designed to help speed people through unnerfed sections of the legendary. You're already completing the section you're on at 2x the rate it was originally intended to be completed. And you admitted earlier that if you knew this was coming you would have grinded valor sooner. That indicates you were being lazy and now are complaining that you aren't at the point where you can utilize the buff they implemented.... Keep whining about being lazy and just go finish the quest at the rate you're able to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not the gains, its the 1k cap. Why i seen the previous buff as near pointless. If i wanted capped on my alts each week i would do it regardless of how fast i gained valor. The existing 50% buff after main is capped was always more then enough for me. Now if they removed the cap during this buff, or remove that part of the quest chain, or any thing else that would let you get past the VP part in one lockout that would solve it.</div></div><hr />

It depends on your luck and your factions.

<br />
This buff is better suited towards those who already put in the work to get their main cloak, stayed subbed, but are still interested in trying other classes either out of curiosity or boredom but cannot be bothered to go through the boring grind for a second or third time. Those who could not be bothered to even fulfill the most basic of basic requirements to capitalize on this buff or have skipped out on the expansion and expect a legendary item simply shouldn't be given a fast track option.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - It can take almost two years for some to make the grind from 85 to 90 and gain 6000 (now 3000 since...forever) valor. Who knew.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should just give this buff and the increase valor buff for the rest of this expansion, I mean come on the only people that needs the cloak now are &quot;alts&quot; and that is one of the few reason people are still playing, to level alts and get them the cloak, most people are already sick and tire of the damn 1 year of no content. and have either quit till Warlords or am just sticking around for Guildies/Friends, might as well give these people something to do since the cloak will most likely be out dated 2 levels into Warlords.</div></div><hr />

There's no way in hell you can do 1 bg a day and get stuck for weeks let alone months. Considering it happens at the same time as the 3k valor quest and you've likely not much else to do as there won't be any sigils to farm, I fail to see how it's anything other than &quot;I refuse to even TOUCH PvP&quot; which is just silly, it's ok to not like it but to 'refuse' to do it?

<br />
And the imbalance is only really serious with IoC and AV recently; Horde lose majorly there but that's not part of the quest - The bgs that are required are slightly in horde's favor, it really shouldn't take you more than a couple of BGs, I can't see why it would be something to complain about.

<br />
It's mainly the feeling that you're being a detriment to your team by being PvE-geared and having little skill in PvP that puts people off with this part. And the BGs required are fairly skill and team-dependent, as one person can throw away a game completely more often than not here, i.e. if a person on your team runs the orb to the edge of the map to &quot;not die&quot;, resulting in your team earning very few points.</div></div><hr />

Intentional hyperbole noted, but devs have already stated that for those of us that have put in the time endgame wise, the reward is that our gear will last throughout most of the leveling experience. Now factor in the fact that our capes are the highest item level in the game so far (in addition to the proc). I doubt it will be replaced until the first raid tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets be honest, it stopped being a Legendary when it became a raid requirement.<br />
Ignoring that it isnt always, the mentality that made it a requirement is because it is so common and comparatively easy to obtain. No previous legendary was viewed as such a requirement and was rather a bonus.</div></div><hr />

It's never been that way in the past and there's no reason to think it will be that way in WoD.<br />
<br />
Items datamined from the WoD alpha show items that are iLevel 630 to 650 by level 95. So your precious cloaks will likely hit the dustbin by level 93 or 94. No reason to grind for cloak now unless you need it to be accepted to some group or you actually enjoy the process. <br />
<br />
Besides there is no structural game design method to make raid gear from a previous expansion last through the next expansion. All the early game content would have to be ludicrously easy to make this idea work. That's why they do a significant gear reset. <br />
<br />
Nobody wants to see the new WoD 5 man instances turned into a faceroll easy-mode joke for players in MoP raid gear.</div></div><hr />

So often I hear stories of Horde players breezing through the BG parts, while Alliance players seem to get stuck on them for days, weeks, or even months, and resort to getting premade BG groups together, and even those sometimes STILL fail.<br />
My priest on the Horde side did each BG exactly once and got wins in both. Total time investment less than an hour.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile my wife on the Alliance side had to run the mines over 30 (yes, thirty!) times before getting a win. I admire her determination. <br />
<br />
On some servers the Horde literally almost always wins the mines. The bad thing about this stage of the quest is that it is ludicrously easy for some players while a huge, frustrating roadblock for others.</div></div><hr />

The reason to expect it will be different is because the dev's have actually said that it will be different. <br />

I'd expect HSOO gear to last until ~97-98 for the most part, and generally be replaced by level 100 normal/heroic dungeons. <br />

If you can put aside your preconception for a moment and look at things rationally you will see that this can't work. <br />
<br />
If Heroic SOO gear were to equal level 100 WoD dungeon gear what would level 90 WoD gear be equal to since it would be a full ten levels back. For your idea to work there would have to be virtually no gear progression through the ten levels of WoD. <br />
<br />
Again I'd advise you to jump over to the WoD section of Wowhead. Item 100 WoD blues are looking like ilevel 630 while purples are somewhere around 660. This means your your Heroic SOO gear will start to fade away around 93 or 94 which is reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem is, it is no work at all, if you raided consistently from 5.0-5.4. god forbid you took a break, and now the only way to obtain them is painfully slow through SoO, or doing LFR with a bunch of noobs in greens. heroic Firelord was more bearable than ToT LFR. <br />
<br />
and if you did miss something, or decide to roll to a new main. You're now at a serious disadvantage from everyone else. Blizzard didnt think things through in MoP. It hates alts<br />

Am I expected to feel bad about some people not doing the first step which can be passively obtained by running scenarios, dungeons, dailies, and raiding since the beginning of Mists on their mains?<br />
<br />
This buff is better suited towards those who already put in the work to get their main cloak, stayed subbed, but are still interested in trying other classes either out of curiosity or boredom but cannot be bothered to go through the boring grind for a second or third time. Those who could not be bothered to even fulfill the most basic of basic requirements to capitalize on this buff or have skipped out on the expansion and expect a legendary item simply shouldn't be given a fast track option.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - It can take almost two years for some to make the grind from 85 to 90 and gain 6000 (now 3000 since...forever) valor. Who knew.<br />
<br />
Most of the complaints are coming from players with alts and especially those who just came back to game after missing the first 4 major patches of MoP. There's a major difference between those people rushing to catch up and someone who has been subbed the entire time and did not bother to do the quest until now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think making it an expansion long thing was both a good idea, and a mistake. People seem to bitch that people won't need to work for the cape... Well, let's think about this. <br />
<br />
Let's pretend I'm a new character in 5.4 <br />
<br />
10 wisdom and 10 power got you a legendary gem. Can I skip this part? I don't want a legendary gem. I can't even use this<br />
<br />
3000 valor and 2 battle grounds get you a legendary gem slot. Can I skip this part? I can't even use this, just like I can't use the gem<br />
<br />
20 secrets gets you a meta gem. Can I do this part? I can use this (buuut, maybe I'll skip it for the cape, some classses dont need it)<br />
<br />
12 secrets gets you a cape. Well, can do this part too. <br />
<br />
So, each part got you something, but why force people to get the useless legionaries first. it would be like if in wrath to get the shadowmourne you needed the hammer from ulduar first.</div></div><hr />

I'm right there with you on this. The game has nothing more going until 6.0 which could be a very long time away. Easing up these quest lines would have given me incentive to go and get it on a few alts and keep me occupied during this boring lull between expansions.

<br />
Likely to make it seem like a &quot;Bonus&quot; and incentivize people to come back to play. If they make it permanent you get people saying &quot;oh its permanent, I'll get to it next month and so on&quot;. My guess is they keep rolling out these things every few weeks to try and lure players back in as the expansion dies down. <br />
<br />
This is the same reason that they are removing that mini/battle pet from the store. It doesnt cost them anything (anymore) to make it and it doesnt take up shelf space. They likely have seen little or no demand for it so they're discontinuing it to milk it for all its worth, which doesn't make sense practically but overall is a probably a good business move.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blue quote + ilevels from Alpha, since you don't believe me and would prefer to wildly speculate:<br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087418960#9<br />
<br />
If you don't want to read the post, then Frostfire starts off around ~510 ilevel at level 90, and Nagrand ends up at around ~590 ilevel at level 99-100. <br />
<br />
Yes, 630 blues have been data mined, and those are from Heroic dungeons (463 equivalent) which would put ~616 right about the level of a normal level 100 dungeon, going by the ilevel 450 level 90 normal dungeon blues from MoP. <br />
<br />
So HSOO gear will last through the leveling process, and start to be replaced in the last zone from quest rewards or more likely, in normal and heroic dungeons. <br />
<br />
I'm sure there will be drops along the way like the MoP blues, or leveling dungeons that will replace some slots, but HSOO gear and the cloak will be fine to start running dungeons at 100 from the way things are looking.</div></div><hr />

The whole idea is that &quot;those items that were immensely powerful that I killed dragons and giants for&quot; shouldn't be replaced by &quot;thing random Draenor mob OO2&quot; is wearing as soon as the new expac drops. <br />
<br />
A lot of players have always hated the huge gear resets in each expansion, and along with the smoothing they're getting rid of it from each expac. Kara raid gear at 70 will continue to be a good bit better than drops from Borean Tundra, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, 630 blues have been data mined, and those are from Heroic dungeons (463 equivalent) which would put ~616 right about the level of a normal level 100 dungeon, going by the ilevel 450 level 90 normal dungeon blues from MoP. <br />
<br />
So HSOO gear will last through the leveling process, and start to be replaced in the last zone from quest rewards or more likely, in normal and heroic dungeons. <br />
<br />
Maybe you're right after all. <br />
<br />
But I don't understand why anybody would want to play through ten levels without upgrading their gear. Getting gear, upgrading gear, improving gear, crafting gear etc has always been a big part of the MMO experience. Who wants to quest and do dungeons for 10 levels and just automatically junk all the gear?<br />
<br />
I always liked the significant gear resets between expansions. Puts everybody back on an even footing and lets everybody play the new content on a fairly even basis. Maybe this is an outgrowth of SOO lasting so long. In the mind of Bliz they are rewarding those who stick around and put 4/4 upgrades on all their raid gear and grind out BIS for every item.<br />
<br />
But, in my mind, it diminishes the game and turns the leveling process into just another mindless grind. Those players with Heroic gear and garrosh heirlooms will just zoom even faster to 100 and plow through the endgame content even faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many people don't care about the shitty leveling experience. Many people just want to rush max level and grind dungeons. Getting gear, upgrading it, etc. takes time, which compromises faster leveling. This is why I hate getting new weapons on my DK while leveling, because you need to go to Ebon Hold (Well now it's not an issue since the portal takes you back to the point where you cast it)</div></div><hr />

Because June 30th wraps up the second quarter and they want to get as many resubs as possible to talk about on the quarterly report.<br />

If it was a permanent buff, people would resub randomly over the coming months and not inflate their sub count for this quarter.</div></div><hr />

People seem to bitch that people won't need to work for the cape... Well, let's think about this. <br />
<br />
Let's pretend I'm a new character in 5.4 <br />
<br />
10 wisdom and 10 power got you a legendary gem. Can I skip this part? I don't want a legendary gem. I can't even use this<br />
<br />
So, each part got you something, but why force people to get the useless legionaries first. it would be like if in wrath to get the shadowmourne you needed the hammer from ulduar first.<br />
<br />
Oh, I can agree. I think if the Legendary rewards (gem and socket) from specific chapters had been useful up through HSoO it would have made the quest much better. However even for a cool end of quest reward like the cloak it makes doing the quest worthwhile. I am one of the late starters on the quest as I recently returned to game after a 2.5 year break and had to relearn how to play my toons. It is silly how much you forget over just a couple of years, though getting back into raiding shape wasn't difficult.<br />
<br />
Currently I am on &quot;A Test of Valor&quot; on two of my most geared toons (both are ilvl 541 for LFR, as I don't like getting carried) and I will not get to join in on the fun and important catch up mechanic gained from this buff. Disappointing.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

Technically Teebone is right on this. After they removed attunements and nerfed BC to the crap house, a fresh 70 could just be carried through BT for a shot at the Warglaives.</div></div><hr />

By now we're so late into the expansion that most people have it on their mains anyway, so it would be nice to get this buff for more than 2 weeks for alts you level up while waiting for the expansion and for new players as well.<br />
On the bright side, I'll be able to finish another 5 cloaks and thus finish my current Horde 90s in terms of cloaks... but on the other side, I'm planning on levelling a bunch of Alliance characters this Summer, and they'll have to do it without the buff. I kinda hope they do what they did with the legendary droprate buff in Diablo, where it started out as a limited time thing and then when people were like &quot;hey, actually seeing drops is nice&quot;, they made it permanent(although I feel like they were going to either way, they just wanted people to get back into the game NOW by saying it was limited at the beginning)</div></div><hr />

You can already farm exalted 45-60 minutes on Thunder Isle without the buff if the place isn't crowded, and it's even faster if you get a group. That's hardly a consolation prize to losing out on saving potentially weeks of Rune/Secrets grinding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or maybe they are just trying to help people see exclusive content at the end of the x-pac like they've done for the past two expansions with the buffs that made the final raiding tiers easier (ICC buff and Dragon Soul buff along w/ raid nerfs). Adding a buff that gives people a leg up in WoW isn't a foreign idea, they've done this for most expansions, so instantly claiming that they are panicked and frantically trying to get players would be jumping to conclusions. I mean think about it, first off, the subloss is part of a year-round cycle that a blind man could see. It doesn't take a genius (and i'm sure blizzard has economy experts) to see the vicious circle of blizzard loosing subs during downtime and gaining them with each x-pac launch or content release. Second off, people claim this type of thing all year round for literally every expansion, so at this point you're just repeating what has been said a thousand times already (and never proven to be true) anyways.</div></div><hr />

They will be applying it between the stated times. Meaning that your realm could have it applied on one of the mentioned days - not that the buff only lasts that long.<br />

<br />
Beginning Friday, May 30 at 9:00 a.m. realm-time, through Tuesday, June 10 at 9:00 a.m. realm-time, we’ll be applying the Heart of the Valorous buff which will increase the rate of Valor Point gains an additional 100%. Don’t wait to get in on the action!<br />

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAaaaaaa *breathe* AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAAAaa... oh man. That's funny. Seriously funny. Are you honestly trying to defend the worst Legendary weapons ever? There was no respect in glaives, not when you saw 2-3 pairs of them every 3rd arena or BG. All three of our Rogues had them. Our Warrior didn't even want them. And Thori'Dal was not the lottery. It was a drop from the end boss of the expansion and completely fucking useless item once obtained. it was eyecandy, nothing more. Anyone who did that content WHEN IT WAS RELEVANT like you say would know that.<br />
<br />
You're talking out your ass now. BC Legendaries were never relevant. One was at best, a tool used to bully BGers and the other was eyecandy that helped you level through LK a little better. Blizzard learned its lesson on the uselessness of these two with Val'Anar (sp) but unfortunately repeated it a bit with Shadowmourne. At least Shadowmourne had other secondary rewards.<br />
<br />
Fangs IMO still remain the best done Legendary although it being set to a single class. It's exactly how one of those should be done in terms of it being a full-fledged quest. Cloak was close to that, but I suppose it was too hard to design extensive class-based solo missions the likes of which rogues had to go through.<br />
