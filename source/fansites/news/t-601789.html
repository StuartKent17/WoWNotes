Naxxramas<br />
Also, in an interview with eGames.de (http://www.egames.de/?ren=news_detail&amp;news_id=65631), Tigole confirmed that Naxxramas will be the first 25 man raid of Northrend. He also confirmed a few things :<br />
Some encounters will be totally retuned to fit 25 man raids (4 Horsemen for example). <br />
Tier 3 Armor models will probably be reused</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it will be just naxxramas, cause it can fly .. and it will be moved over northrend and it will be retunned for lvl 80</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kil'Jaeden as the final encounter in the &quot;Burning Crusader&quot;? Makes sense. And a nice advisorless Kael'thas...yummie :)</div></div><hr />

he means the Sunwell Plateau, not Naxxramas...<br />
<br />
which i am 99% sure IS going to be another naxxramas...released a few(1-4)months b4 expansion..not enough time for ppl to get attuned/start downing tht many bosses(my guild had managed to get half of naxx down, then stopped cuz bc would replace all our gear). but there were many guilds who couldnt even attempt naxx..</div></div><hr />

And if u would defeat Kil'jeaden, that would probely destroy almost all the threat against azeroth, will not happen, and if he were to acctuly enter azeroth that would case and other war, like when Archimonde entered he nerly destroyed azeroth, and kil'jeaden is even more power full than he was. Kil'jeaden could possbliy be the last boss of wow what so ever but not for a meaningless encounter just be4 an other expansion...<br />

End the threat against Azeroth? Isn't there some guy sitting on a frozen throne that would beg to differ with you? We should have an expansion to fight him sometime. Deathwing still lurks somewhere. Whatever is in the Emerald Dream (if it's not connected to Deathwing as well) Not to mention Sargeras, like exorius said above me.</div></div><hr />

so what happen to T3 by that time? totally remove from game?</div></div><hr />

Paladins only have 3 good looking sets *lightforge, judgement and crystalforge (crystalforge looks nice on BE and female humans, of which I am the latter)<br />
<br />
before TBC T2 judgement was my aim since it was the set best suited for RET paladins.<br />
before I could get it TBC came out....they re-used the model but made it for healing -_-* <br />
so they better make a cool armor for all races instead of re-using ugly transformer paladin T3 which looks ugly everywhere except on BE where it looks less ugly <br />
<br />
Blizzard owes it to Paladins to make a VERY nice looking set for once....T5 was decent but no where in comparison to what the other classes got<br />
(T4 was to much designed for dranei, T6 is friggen ugly so a good pala set would only be fair)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If i am not mistaken, Deathwing lost his extra power when the Demon Soul was destroyed. The other remaining dragonflights can kick the crap out of him now, which is why he bolted in the first place.<br />
<br />
Also, wouldnt it take the power of the sunwell to resurrect Sargeras as it did for Arthas to resurrect Kel'Thuzad?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
True, Deathwing isn't as much of a physical threat as before, but I'd still consider him a decent threat considering how smart he is. Manipulation can go a long way.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about the Sunwell thing with Sargeras. That's probably true. It could be possible though, the Sunwell is obviously playing a part in Kil'jaeden coming soon so they could easily write in Sargeras later.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 3 Armor models will probably be reused<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm tired of all my gear looking like Tier sets. I can't find a piece of good rogue armor without looking like I'm in recolored Tier 2. Bloodfang was really cool when it came out, but I'm not interested anymore. Give me something new. The art department is getting very lazy. Everything in BC is just a recolored version of something else. As long as new looking gear doesn't lead to bigger weapons and spikier shoulders and everything glowing, I'm all for it (I'm a rogue damnit, I can't sneak around with a giant glowing dagger/sword.)</div></div><hr />

Nah, a centaure would probably just count as a horseman... My guess is 2x horsemen, and a dwarf on a poney :-)</div></div><hr />
