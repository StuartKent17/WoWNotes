LFD_RANDOM_REWARD_EXPLANATION1 = &quot;The first seven random dungeons of this tier that you complete each week will earn you:&quot;; <br />
<br />
Apparently, Blizzard is going to change the daily dungeon quest to a 7 daily quests/week cap instead of 1 quest/day. Obviously this change will make the life of players considerably easier, especially for those of you who have a lot of rerolls or only play on week ends. Of course, nothing confirmed yet, etc etc etc ...<br />
<br />
<br />
The other changes are:<br />
Random Dungeons<br />
<br />
INCLUDED_DUNGEONS = &quot;Included Dungeons&quot;;<br />
INCLUDED_DUNGEONS_SUBTEXT = &quot;The following dungeons are included in your level range when queueing for a Random Dungeon:&quot;; <br />

OPTION_TOOLTIP_OPTIMIZE_NETWORK_SPEED = &quot;Enable this option to optimize network usage for speed in order to decrease lag.\nThis will increase your bandwidth usage, and may cause problems in some environments. Disabling this option may help resolve certain disconnection issues.&quot;; <br />
OPTION_TOOLTIP_USEIPV6 = &quot;Enables the use of IPv6, the technology behind the next-generation Internet.\nRequires IPv6 connectivity to the internet. Checking this box without IPv6 connectivity may prevent you from playing WoW.&quot;; <br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0.6 Hotfixes - March 16<br />
A new wave of hotfixes has been deployed on live servers. (Well, that's actually an update of the past 2 weeks apparently)<br />
March 2 - March 16<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Using macros no longer halts or delays transports.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />

<br />
Casting Holy Word: Chastise against bosses will cause damage, but no longer disorient them when they are immune to such effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Bastion of Twilight<br />
<br />
Valiona and Theralion overall damage and health has been reduced by roughly 10% on Heroic difficulty. In addition, Twilight Zone no longer increases damage taken from Rift Blast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent<br />
<br />
Atramedes will no longer sometimes snap back to his starting location as he finishes casting Sonic Breath.<br />
Magmaw overall damage and health was a little too high on all difficulties and has been reduced slightly. In addition, on Heroic difficulty, Nefarian will now prefer ranged targets when spawning Blazing Bone Constructs.<br />
Maloriak’s Scorching Breath should no longer incorrectly share its damage among pets. To offset what would be increased damage per player as a result of this fix, the damage dealt by the ability has been reduced on Heroic difficulty.<br />
Players will move at the same speed, even when setting their normal speed to &quot;walk&quot; using the keybind, when Nefarian casts Dominion.<br />
The Omnotron Defense System encounter has had its health reduced by 15% on Heroic difficulty, and the damage of Incineration Security Measure has been reduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The Sands of Time is now a blue superior-quality item. This item can still be used to craft Vial of the Sands when combined with other required materials. The vendor price is unchanged.<br />

<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
Feralas<br />
<br />
Shandris Feathermoon can no longer be pulled too far from her default location before resetting (i.e. she won’t be waging war from the Orgrimmar Auction House anymore).<br />
<br />
<br />
Uldum<br />
<br />
The Beserking buff obtained by killing Schnottz Supply Choppers will now be removed when a player leaves Uldum.<br />
<br />
<br />

Optional Bosses/Heroic Halls of Origination<br />
We'll need to weigh the value of optional dungeon and raid bosses further before we make any changes. There's good arguments on both sides. On the one hand, optional bosses can be great for keeping dungeons and raids from feeling too linear or formulaic -- and, when done right, they can also give groups a meaningful choice between getting extra loot and completing a run faster. On the other, optional bosses can sometimes create social tension, especially in Dungeon Finder groups, if players disagree whether they should invest the time to fight them.<br />
<br />
We know there’s room for improvement, though. For example, we understand that it's probably not the best idea to have optional bosses dropping loot that's BiS. Giving those bosses side-grades (rather than strict upgrades) or similar items could make the &quot;extra loot&quot; vs. &quot;quicker run&quot; decision less stressful. We also feel that optional bosses in general might work better in raids than in dungeons because raids tend to be made up of players who know each other and/or have a strong leader who's empowered to make calls about which bosses to kill.<br />
<br />
Heroic Halls of Origination is a good example of where optional bosses can cause conflicts. In retrospect, we feel that it may have been better to require players to kill all four of the &quot;top&quot; bosses -- Isiset, Ammunae, Setesh, and Rajh -- to get credit for their random Heroic dungeon rewards (instead of just Rajh). While we don't yet know if retrofitting the dungeon or the random dungeon reward requirements is the best course of action, we've learned a lot from watching groups, reading your feedback, and just playing ourselves. We’re definitely keeping those lessons in mind as we develop future content and if we do make any changes, we'll be sure to let you know.

<br />
Its not more daily heroics. Its basically just saying &quot;ok instead of getting valor from the first heroic you complete each day, you'll now get your valor from the first 7 random heroics you do each WEEK. A good change I guess.</div></div><hr />

I remember there were a lot of times in WOTLK after the LK 5mans were introduced that a lot of tanks would queue, and then drop group if HOR or POS came up. (especially HOR). It looks almost like they are going to ´force´us to do only ZA and ZG in order to get valor??<br />
<br />
I like the 7 per week rather than 1 per day. I never get to play on weekends.</div></div><hr />

It's basically just a more flexible version of getting 490 VP a week. In other words, it doesn't affect people who play every day, but only want to run 1 heroic a day and it helps out those who don't get to play every day just a little bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2011-03-17, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The daily heroics adjustment offers those with a more limited playtime to condense it instead of missing out.<br />
The same amount of time can be put into it, just as you see fit not being forced to split it up.<br />
Many people have jobs which will restrict their free time at specific times of the week, so being able to earn a weeks worth potentially in one or more free days is a huge improvement.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand the reason even having anything optional in the dungeons. Since it varies a lot depending on the dungeon. Of course you're going to have some overgeared tank that says &quot;screw it&quot; and there is nothing the rest of the group can do about it. At the end of the day it's the tank that make the call. That is not how it's suppose to be.<br />
<br />
As a dps you're still stuck in the queue for 30+ min before even getting a group. How about blizzard actually stepping up and fixing the dungeons in cataclysm. In wotlk the queue time for a dps was around 5-15 min. That is okay. Having to wait 30+ min for a group in cataclysm and it being a high chance of failure just isn't right. Especially when you consider that deadmines is the new occulus when it comes to tank leaving when entering.</div></div><hr />

While its a great option for weekend-only players, I know many people who can't play enough to sit through 7 heroics, then try to make a raid/etc. So while sure you might do 2 or 3 on your main instead of 1, I doubt 90% of the community will be doing 7 heroic marathons. Also, my guild uses heroics to help max exp daily, so it would make more sense for us to space it out. Perhaps instead of 1 heroic on your main/alts each day, you knock out each char in a day or 2 day period. Overall, a very nice change if you happen to be busy one day and can't get on.</div></div><hr />

Only problem is Huldu, how do blizzard reduce the que times ?<br />
<br />
How long you que depends on the ratio of Tanks to DPS to Healers. Cataclysm brought a welcome change with the difficulty level, however a lot of Tanks from wrath switched from Tanking to another role due to it being more challenging. Only way for que's to be reduced is by more people playing a Tank role. Tanking is more challenging that wrath, but its not that difficult either.</div></div><hr />

Yea on the PTR you can find it by pressing escape and clicking 'System' (replaces where Video was since everything is in 1 tab now) and there is a Network option there where you can enable it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've confirmed what Mech's said above - the Video , Sound and Video options have been removed from the settings menu you bring up by pressing Escape. They are now all grouped under the &quot;System&quot; button along with a new networking button. <br />
<br />
Just to add here - in Advanced is a new option to manually the graphics API within game.<br />
<br />
This makes it easier for people to check and set what graphics api they have set to rather then pulling up config.wtf or god forbid forgetting they had something set in there.<br />
<br />
I just hope there's sanity checks on it. IE You try to select OpenGL on a Windows/ Wine install and it tells you &quot;This will neteur your graphics card to that of a 1930's model T ford. Do not set if you expect your system not to crash&quot;. Or similarly trying to set DX11 for a card that can't take it.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong getting all your VP in one day for the week vs every single day throughout the week is nice and all, but won't this pretty much kill LFG? I mean if people are complaining about wait times as they are now for DPS 20 mins+ what will they look like when the change goes through? People will start doing more whenever they're free, but kinda closing down any other days.<br />
<br />
I dunno, just seems counter productive on Blizz's part to set this up. Sure it frees up some peoples schedules, but on the other hand has a possibility of decimating others. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Yea if 2-3 ppl do not want to do them, then you wont get to that run. I have been working up my dk, as tank and often ask if anyone minds if we do all bosses in HoO. I have yet to have someone say I can't do them. <br />
<br />
On the other end, I qued as my druid tank and got HoO heroic. They were standing at the elevator area and told me that they wanted to do the whole dungeon and if I didn't want to, I could leave. While they were a little ruder then I would have preferred, I still told them I didn't mind. It seems they all agreed and kicked the last pug tank who only wanted a fast run. You only need 3 ppl to agree with you and if you don't have that many, then you are out voted and need to get over it.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand the reason even having anything optional in the dungeons. Since it varies a lot depending on the dungeon. Of course you're going to have some overgeared tank that says &quot;screw it&quot; and there is nothing the rest of the group can do about it. At the end of the day it's the tank that make the call. That is not how it's suppose to be.<br />
<br />
As a dps you're still stuck in the queue for 30+ min before even getting a group. How about blizzard actually stepping up and fixing the dungeons in cataclysm. In wotlk the queue time for a dps was around 5-15 min. That is okay. Having to wait 30+ min for a group in cataclysm and it being a high chance of failure just isn't right. Especially when you consider that deadmines is the new occulus when it comes to tank leaving when entering.<br />
<br />
Do Tanks leave Deadmines? I tank, and I find that odd...If you have a proper leash on your DPS and know how to use (and not break) CC, that place is a cakewalk. True, the last gauntlet can be annoying if someone lags behind or just lags in general, but that's my only bother with it :P<br />
<br />
I find Blackrock Caverns much much more annoying, or Grim Batol if I'm forced to use pug dps &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
On the topic of having to wait 30 minutes for dungeons...I don't know if this is really accurate, or just my biased view (probably is :P), but with Cataclysm, Blizzard made tanking as a Paladin ...I wouldn't call it hard, but I'd call it less than facerollingly super easy like it was in WoTLK. I tanked heroics in WoTLK on my Paladin, and the first time I tanked, I was flabbergasted. That was simply much too easy :p<br />
<br />
(I tank on a Bear Druid atm, just if you want to lambast me for my tanking class &quot;omg no, bears aer way easier!!1&quot;)</div></div><hr />

Then you have the hardcore WoW players who just like to power through everything. They'll also probably mow through their 7 dungeons at the beginning of each week.

There are potential &quot;issues&quot;, but my guess is that the spread will be just like it is in arenas. Some do them on Tuesday, others do them on non-raid nights, and finally there's the group who wait until Monday night then beg their partner to do the 10 quick matches for points. <br />
<br />
Personally I think it's great that I no longer have to worry about getting off work right at 5pm so that I have enough time to do my daily heroic before the raid.</div></div><hr />

Eh? You still get JP from all the bosses, its not a huge loss.<br />
<br />
As far as the 7 heroics per week thing: Its good, but not ideal. Instead you should have 1 heroic for VP per day, but if you don't do it on that day it rolls over to the next day up to 7. Even though this removes some player flexibility (in that you can't front load all your heroics on the first day of the week), it means that if you log in the next day you still have something to do. Otherwise, you could find that after grinding hard the previous day, you have nothing to work for on the next<br />
<br />
Also, apply this once per week thing to everything, including quests and professions with cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And before anyone starts yelling &quot;OMG Blizzard is catering to the casuals!&quot;, they are after all, the majority.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am looking forward to seeing this. Sometimes I cannot get on because of schoolwork and projects and what not so I miss a day or two...or three of not being able to do my daily heroic for VP. I play a lot when I can but sometimes, there are just things in real life that hinder people's ability to play the game. And Blizzard allowing them to be able to still enjoy the benefits of the game is actually a great business strategy and a great gift to the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

It reduces / masks the HC grind a lot. Instead of forcing you to log on every day just for the HC or do it after a long raid just so that you don't lose the valor due to the reset now you can do 1-2 middle week and then the rest on the weekend. Less forced grind is good in my book. The HCs were the last thing forcing you to log daily and now it's gone. Gz Blizz!!!</div></div><hr />

Best night for me is thursdays. weekly reset is tuesday. All the tanks and healers will chain run their 7 randoms tuesday and thus have no need to do randoms for the rest of the week, such as thursday. Thus reducing the number of people using LFD on thursday, therby increasing the time it takes to get into a random.<br />
<br />
Tuesday/wednesday and the weekend will have better queue times. The days inbetween are gonna suck.</div></div><hr />

It looks almost like they are going to ´force´us to do only ZA and ZG in order to get valor??<br />
<br />
I like the 7 per week rather than 1 per day. I never get to play on weekends.<br />
<br />
ZA and ZG are on a seperate queue(&quot;Random Rise of the Zandalari Heroic&quot;) from the &quot;old&quot; heroics(&quot;Random Cataclysm Heroic&quot;). You get 140 VP each from the first 7 ZA/ZG each week, and 70 VP each from the first &quot;old&quot; heroics each week. Just checked it ingame on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

Thank god ZA/ZG are on a seperate level. The number of times I had freshly dinged 80's with a couple of AH BOEs somehow getting into HOR and dying because they were severely undergeared.

<br />
Remember each heroic dungeon boss kill still awards 70 JP. You just won't be getting extra JP as your reward from finishing a random dungeon the first seven times in that week; you will get VP instead. But you will never stop accumulating JP, and considering that 5 bosses equal 350 JP, I don't think you really have a problem.<br />

You get 140 VP each from the first 7 ZA/ZG each week, and 70 VP each from the first &quot;old&quot; heroics each week. Just checked it ingame on the PTR.<br />
<br />
This is interesting. I suppose that heroics from the Zandalari Tier and the Normal Tier will both count towards the seven-a-week limit on randoms with VP rewards. Otherwise, the potential weekly intake of VP will have gone over the 1250 cap, based on heroic 5-mans alone (490+980 = 1470 VP), albeit requiring a ridiculous 14 random heroic dungeon runs a week, 7 on each tier.<br />
<br />
Then again, and even though I highly doubt it will be the case, this may be exactly what Blizzard is aiming for. I say this given the fact that it remains impossible to complete Tier Sets with VP alone and there is no access to 356 Epic weapons, bracers and neck pieces or additional 356 Epic rings/trinkets/cloaks without raiding. And then there are Heroic Raids and their further upgraded rewards.<br />
<br />
So regardless, the raiding community will always have better gear on average than the non-raiding community. Greater risk would continue offering greater rewards. This would also enable and encourage more PuG raids among the non-raiding community, since gear levels would be less disparate. So it might not be a bad thing if they do implement it this way.</div></div><hr />

You don't HAVE to play every day for hours, it's just a game. There's so many things you can do...go out, see friends, watch some TV, read a book, play another game, get a gf/bf...even Blizzard tells you to take everything in moderation. You might be doing it wrong... :)<br />

How about blizzard actually stepping up and fixing the dungeons in cataclysm. In wotlk the queue time for a dps was around 5-15 min. That is okay. Having to wait 30+ min for a group in cataclysm and it being a high chance of failure just isn't right. <br />
<br />
I don't know how everyone is thinking who keeps saying Blizz should &quot;fix&quot; the queues. HOW?<br />
<br />
Blizzard can't fix this. Queue times depends on the number of people willing to tank/heal. Most people can't be arsed to do that, because it requires a bit more responsibility than facerolling as a dps, so they will have to accept queueing. It's that simple. You have a choice.<br />
<br />
You're willing to take on the responsibility of tanking? Great, you can get in instantly.<br />
<br />
You're willing to be the healer? Great, you will have short queues.<br />
<br />
You refuse to take on the responsibility of tanking/healing? Fine, but you have to wait then.<br />
<br />
Clearly most people prefer the last option, they don't mind waiting in order to avoid the responsibility. If people were not OK with waiting, they would have respecced/rerolled. I know there are &quot;pure dps&quot;, but I see more dps DKs, dps Warriors, dps druids, dps palas, dps shamans, priests than locks/mages/rogues/hunters in groups. These have all made a choice to rather wait than heal/tank.<br />
<br />
Only thing I could see Blizz do to &quot;fix&quot; the queues is things like giving tanks and healers twice the valor points for dungeon and some such, which is never going to happen because the forums would drown in a flood of tears.</div></div><hr />

It looks almost like they are going to ´force´us to do only ZA and ZG in order to get valor??<br />
<br />
I like the 7 per week rather than 1 per day. I never get to play on weekends.<br />
<br />
Well at the moment on the ptr you have 2 sets of heroics ZG and ZA on a seprate queue and all the rest on the other and if you queue for ZA or ZG randoms it awards 140 valour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard can't fix this. Queue times depends on the number of people willing to tank/heal. Most people can't be arsed to do that, because it requires a bit more responsibility than facerolling as a dps, so they will have to accept queueing. It's that simple. You have a choice.<br />
<br />
I rolled a dps priest. I have an *offspec* of healing. Out the box my priority leveling to 85 from 80 was dps. I chose dps items, (re-)learnt my dps rotation and this continued through normal and heroic dungeons. It's still my main spec. <br />
<br />
I then had to re-learn how to heal since the bad habits that WotLK taught combined with the addition of chakra ment that healing needed a new rotation.<br />
<br />
However, you've clearly never healed in dps gear in cata. Even Normals were difficult at best and I only leveled the healing offspec to help raid progress. Most of the items in my healing offspec are JP items, and I still don't have any healing rings. <br />
<br />
You say people have a choice and my choice was to do dps. It was not that I didn't want to take on the responsibility of healing, and my class excludes me from tanking (however everyone knows in a clutch a spriest makes a great tank). <br />
<br />
Most pugs do not understand that most mechanics in Cata dungeons are that you can AVOID ALL DAMAGE unless you do something silly. There are VERY FEW instances of AoE damage outside of boss fights. Even then the tank or other capable classes can interrupt a great deal of damage. If dps realized this fact and combined it with the fact that generating aggro isn't simple anymore for most tank classes, then they'd put less pressure on the healers and tanks and more people would be inclined to heal or tank.<br />
<br />
When I heal PuGs (which is rare, but it'll happen sometimes), and a DPS doesn't understand the above fact, then they'll find themselves skipping a healing pass. If they die in that gap then, well, they shouldn't be so silly. Ripping aggro from the tank, standing in the fire, not clustering up to share the rare &quot;AoE-divided-by-people-hit&quot; damage.. this'll cause damage to you that I won't be so quick in healing. Do it once and I'll forgive, do it often and you'll die until you learn. Don't like it? Either ask why you're dying so much and take notes on the reply (which won't be &quot;lol u suk, l2p&quot;) and you'll have a better time. This in turn will make the tank have a better time, and even make those in the group who are a healing or tanking offspec capable class reconsider healing/tanking.<br />
<br />
Being said, my lv85 pala is prot as mainspec and I still queue up with that as a tank. I'm just slightly less evil at letting people die than on my holy spec priest.<br />
<br />
<br />
In answer to the fixing of the queue, they should have a buff for pug healers/tanks like luck of the draw, but only applies to them (tank one would increase the aggro they generate by 5/10/15%, healing one would decrease the mana cost of healing spells by 5/10/15%). They should then remove/nerf the healing bonus from luck of the draw. This, in my eyes, will encourage more people to heal/tank.</div></div><hr />

I'm tank so i'm about 101% sure, i'll do my HCs on day 1 each week, but i still feel sorry for DPSers regarding queue times getting even worse now.<br />
<br />
Seriously now, you can do 7 Cataclysm heroics in one night?<br />
<br />
I tried to grind out emblems for Heirlooms one evening during Wrath. On a tank. I couldn't get 7 in; I think I stopped at 4 or 5 at which point I was kind of crispy. And that was in Wrath, where you could do 3 heroics in an hour, and it was after the speedups for Occ so even that wasn't slow. Even though they were easy we blew through them at a relentless pace and it gets to you after a while. <br />
<br />
7 Cata heroics in a row might just do me in. I'd need the rest of the week to recover.<br />
<br />
Maybe people who aren't working that day and don't have a spouse and children to worry about and/or don't have a raid scheduled that night might knock out all 7 in one day, but that's a serious stretch.<br />
<br />
I think Monday might be rough, and I think Thursday might be rough. I think the majority will use this to get in maybe 2 in a day since they won't have a chance on another day to pick it up.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I wish they'd do this with other dailies as well (*cough*JC*cough*).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would i make my tank join the queue every day, now that i can just get 4 friends and steam roll 7 Hcs and be done for the week. this will make the LFG system even longer<br />
He's still playing the same amount of time, just in a more concentrated burst. If it takes you 45 minutes X7 days to do your randoms you've spent a little over 5 hours in randoms. If it takes him a little over 5 hours on Saturday he's spent a little over 5 hours. If you divide yours up and then play your alt on Saturday, or farm, no problem you're getting more than he is. Some people's schedule allows them to play a little bit everyday, other people schedule allows them to play a lot on one day, but not much otherwise. If you happen to be one of the people (lucky?) that can play a lot everyday, then you'll just have more stuff you can do after you've either done your daily or ground out all 7.<br />
<br />
ETA: There'll be at least one tank available on days other than Tues. You can bet your ass I'm not grinding seven heroics every Tuesday night. 2-3 is definitely my limit.</div></div><hr />

Valor after the first tier is a terrible model. Being forced to farm 2 year old heroics for endgame tier is just insulting. Pretty much came down to raid for gear. In my opinion they are right.<br />

Forcing us to continue to run heroics to get current gear sucks.

<br />
IPv4 address blocks ran out last month. This means going forward, some people who get internet (mostly in newly set up areas) will only have an IPv6 address. Problem is that everybody wants an IPv4 address, as some software and routers can't handle IPv6, which will prevent anyone who only uses IPv6 from connecting to those people.</div></div><hr />

That is exactly what they are doing. Your first 7 heroics will award the usual 70 valor each. After that they will resort to the default 70 justice each (you will still earn 70 justice per boss in both cases). If you only do 4 or 5 heroics then you'll get 280 or 350 valor points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How long you que depends on the ratio of Tanks to DPS to Healers. Cataclysm brought a welcome change with the difficulty level, however a lot of Tanks from wrath switched from Tanking to another role due to it being more challenging. Only way for que's to be reduced is by more people playing a Tank role. Tanking is more challenging that wrath, but its not that difficult either.<br />
<br />
This. Blizzard has no control over how long queues are for certain roles. Most people speculate it has something to do with their &quot;fail servers&quot; or their &quot;game engine&quot; but infact the ratio of roles that determine a queue time, its simple math really. Like topdog said, this has to do with cataclysm bringing more challenge. Im not sure whether The end of BC -&gt; wrath expansion transition was different from end of wrath -&gt; cataclysm (in terms of difficulty) but im sure if LFD was incorporated then, it would be longer queues after the transition.</div></div><hr />

^This. It amazes me that some people on this forum can't even understand basic math. 5 hours of randoms over 7 days is the same amount of time spent as 5 hours of randoms over 1 day. You do not get &quot;free VP&quot; by doing them all in one day. DrgnDancer is correct on player availability as well. There will be plenty of people who will wait until the weekends to do their random due to having jobs during the week as well as raiding on weeknights. Not everyone can play 8 hours a day, but since the amount of time spent doing heroics for both types of players is still the exact same amount, there is no catering to people who only play 5 hours a week, as well as no free VP.</div></div><hr />

No since raiding it was about the same. I would start doing the daily then stop soon after raiding gave me enough points to get my items. And when you are in heroic modes(which I am) you probably don't need the emblem gear anymore.<br />

You basically just don't want the option for emblems from heroics. You don't need to do them then. Just use your emblems from raiding. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

No one says you have to do heroics. You are still going to be getting valor from raiding. I stopped doing my daily like a month or less into cata.<br />
<br />
Seriously. Weekly cap is 1250. You almost reach the weekly cap just from doing 13/13(counting BH) on 25 man. If you're in a 25 man guild that clears all 13 every week, you need to run two dailies to reach the cap. If you're in a 10 man guild that clears all 13 every week, you need to run four dailies to reach the cap. If your guild doesn't clear all 13 on normal mode on 10 or 25 man then you probably still need a valor piece or two.</div></div><hr />

The obvious solution to this is to make entry level tanking gear much easier to access. I have all four tanks and it's certainly not a lack of desire to tank that stopped me from tanking early on. It was the fact that an ilvl 329 tank will die in randoms. So I had to run heroics as dps for a long time before I could queue as tank. If tanks have to start out as dps and dps have to start out as dps and healers have to start out as dps then obviously dps will have long queues. Blacksmiths should level off of producing 333 tanking gear for almost every slot. Leatherworkers should level off of 333 leather with dodge on it. There should also be some easily obtainable healing gear. Probably two trinkets with healing procs so that you're giving a boost to healers and not other casters.  Giving people the option of tanking/healing at entry level without bogging the group down will enable them to queue as tanks/healers and reduce the queues for dps.<br />
<br />
And while you're at it stop putting tanking gear on the first boss of every instance so that tanks won't leave after the first boss everytime their gear doesn't drop. Make tanking gear drop from the last boss so they're forced to stick around. This is a daily occurrence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong getting all your VP in one day for the week vs every single day throughout the week is nice and all, but won't this pretty much kill LFG? I mean if people are complaining about wait times as they are now for DPS 20 mins+ what will they look like when the change goes through? People will start doing more whenever they're free, but kinda closing down any other days.<br />
<br />
I dunno, just seems counter productive on Blizz's part to set this up. Sure it frees up some peoples schedules, but on the other hand has a possibility of decimating others. /shrug<br />
<br />
I don´t understand why people think this will affect queue times at all Queue times are all about the proportion of dps to tanks. This change will do nothing to that. Yes, there will probably be a bunch of tanks who try to do all their weekly heroics on tuesday.. but that also means there are 3x´s as many DPS who will get all their heroics done on tuesday.<br />
<br />
The only real difference i see happening is that GOOD dps will get their heroics done faster because more than likely if a tank does a heroic and has good dps, he will requeue with those same dps. However, bad dps will get dropped and the tank will requeue and hopefully get better DPS. It will be similar to leveling dungeons now. There have been times, as a tank, where i have done 5 or more dungeons in a row and kept the same dps just because they were doing good. On the occassions where I got bad dps, I would just drop the group after finishing the dungeon and get different dps. The bad dps in the previous group then had to wait in a queue to get their next dungeon.<br />
<br />
But this still will not increase queue times for the áverage´ dps... because you still have each tank needing to do 7 dungeons per week and each dps needing to do 7 dungeons per week.. exactly the same as before.<br />
<br />
The one drawback is that daily quests are still daily. If I log in and queue as a dps now. I currently have 30 mins wait.. but I also have 30 mins of daily quests that I can do while waiting. With this change, if I have to wait 30 mins between each dungeon, I no longer have ´efficiency´ like that. After the first queue, I will be out of productive things to do. Even still, I welcome this change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
long time listener, first time caller...this is a very insightful post, imo...i've been forced down the same path, queueing as dps and hoping for offset tank loot while grinding points for gear (on a dk and war)...this makes the grind nearly twice as long because to you need to upgrade your dps gear to keep your runs going smoothly, too, unless you're ok being that 6k dps guy who's a drag on the group and makes everything painfully slow (which i'm not)...also, 525 blacksmithing provides very little help to wannabe tanks starting out unless you're in a guild that'll feed you orbs by carrying you, most likely as subpar dps...<br />
<br />
rep gear helps, but having to grind out dps gear, then tank gear, means it takes longer to get a viable tank up and running...and again, it is a shame that blacksmithing doesn't provide more help to fill the gap in the 333-346 range...</div></div><hr />

* Shandris Feathermoon can no longer be pulled too far from her default location before resetting (i.e. she won’t be waging war from the Orgrimmar Auction House anymore).<br />

Was one of the most amusing things i had ever witnessed in WoW. Followed by Murloc zombie beach in Isle of Quedanas and Gamon being kited all around org when he was lv85 elite with buffs when we were still lv80~</div></div><hr />

<br />
People today who can't do their daily random heroics every day probably only does a couple of daily heroics each week. So two heroics a week for some people. <br />
<br />
With this new change people can get seven heroics in each week because of how flexible this system will be. So seven heroics a week for these people.<br />
<br />
This equal an increase no matter what roles. More people will be doing heroics.<br />
<br />
For those who believe the queue times will be worse at the end of the raid-week are probably wrong. Less tanks and healers may be doing heroics at that stage.. but same will be applied to the amount of DPS:er. It is not like every DPS lives in a world where they must do all their heroics at the end of the raid-week and every tank and healer must do theirs at the start. It will balance out, just like today. Just that there will be more heroics run going every week than before because of this flexible system. <br />
<br />
This change won't change queue times to the worse. It may not change at all or it may get even better.</div></div><hr />

This change won't change queue times to the worse. It may not change at all or it may get even better.Lets assume the following...<br />
<br />
I'm Joe, the Casual with 5 85s... out of these: 1 tank, 1 healer, 3 dps. Now, prior to the changes, i barely had time to do all HCs all day with all my toons. So i possibily did 1-2 each day, with only a subset of my toons. Of course, queue time for tanks and healers rocks, so my tank and my healer are almost all decked out in VP/JP gear, while my other alts are possibly in 316s and 333s. Now come the changes and suddenly weeeee - i have more time to get my alts geared up finally. You see where is this going?</div></div><hr />

I do 3 maybe 4 in a week, and maybe 1 on a alt. If your heroic number doesn't reset that will be fine, but if the number resets every Tuesday like raids do then it's pointless for me to run heroics, as I would never reach the magic number 7. Some of us are gainfully employed, and making sure I run all 7 instances is not expenditure of my game time.</div></div><hr />

You are given more time to gear up alts as the system is more flexible after the next patch. If you miss doing a random daily heroic on a Thursday and Friday because of lack of time you can in next patch catch up during the weekend or when you got more time. This will mean that people will do more heroics in general than they would have done normally. Now this won't apply to exactly everyone but probably for most players. <br />
<br />
Me personally got most time during weekend. I only need VP. I play on tank. Currently I do two daily heroics each week. After the next patch I will probably do seven daily heroics each week. Five more heroic runs than before. So more people will do more heroics with these changes. It saves time for people with a tight schedule, as they are not forced to run heroics when they don't really have time.. like on weekdays.. and they can just do these heroics during the weekends instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The IPv6 backbones are different than the IPv4 backbones currently, as the IPv4 backbone isn't going to support IPv6 yet. So the route the IPv6 packets are taking is going to be totally different than your IPv4 traffic for the time being. That WILL become the same thing, eventually, but not in the immediate future. So, at the beginning, your IPv6 packets are going to be on a route that's less overloaded than then normal IPv4 traffic.<br />
<br />
I hate it when people think of the internet as being a single &quot;Wire&quot;, as if you were physically connected directly to the datacenter you're trying to reach. Try getting the big picture, folks. All's not that easy and simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover, routers have a default QoS that specifies that IPv6 traffic has more priority over IPv4 traffic.</div></div><hr />

And I would guess most IPv6 traffic would be encapsulated over IPv4 at that point still wouldn't it? If you're tunneling then you might see more of a latency loss from overhead than you gain from the stretch of Ipv6 internet. Of course if your local ISP does already support IPv6 then you should see a speed increase in the short term, until everyone else switches over :)</div></div><hr />

I think that since they are capping Valor Points, it's just going to leave people not doing them. There won't be a point and no reward. Most of a raiding toons points will come from raiding, as thus, running a 5 man will be pointless. Maybe some of the 4.1's for the mounts, but after that, it's not a chance in hell.</div></div><hr />
