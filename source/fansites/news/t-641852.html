Noblegarden Rescheduled<br />
Nethaera just posted a message to announce that the Noblegarden event will be delayed this year. It definitely looks like another confirmation that Patch 3.1 won't hit the live servers before April 14 at least. <br />
Many players may have noticed that Noblegarden has been removed from the in-game calendar. While the event is not being removed from the game, it is being delayed slightly and will not occur as originally scheduled on April, 12. We will be implementing this event at a future date, however.<br />
<br />
There have been many additions made to the event including a change to the length of which the event runs (1 week) and additional content for players to enjoy. We look forward to sharing this new experience with you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Websites Updates - Part 2<br />
A few more things were fixed on the site.<br />
<br />
I removed the huge boss posts from the front page to make the loading time faster, this will probably make IE users very happy. <br />
I corrected a few errors in boss pages, I also added the meta-achievement to the Noblegarden achievements page. <br />
A few bugs with the menu are being fixed as we speak. It will now save the position of the menu between page changes and a few visual bugs have been fixed with IE.<br />
<br />
We're still working with a few bugs, now might be the right time to report them in the Suggestions and Feedback (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?board=7.0) forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
Filefront NOT closing down<br />
FileFront has been acquired by the original founders of the site and will NOT be suspended as previously announced. This is NOT an April Fool's Joke.<br />
<br />
After learning about Ziff Davis Media's plan to suspend FileFront at the end of March, the original founders of FileFront made the decision to buy it back from Ziff Davis Media.<br />
<br />
We're happy to announce to the gaming community that as of today, April 1st, 2009, FileFront is a completely independent company again and is no longer part of Ziff Davis Media. All previously suspended services should be active and working again. We thank Ziff Davis Media for their cooperation and willingness to keep the site and community alive.<br />
<br />
Due to the very unfortunate timing of this event and related announcements on March 24th and April 1st (April Fool's Day), we'd like to make it perfectly clear that:<br />
<br />
[i]1) The March 24th announcement about FileFront suspending its operation was NOT an early April Fool's joke.<br />
2) This announcement about the original founders buying back FileFront from Ziff Davis Media is also NOT an April Fool's joke.<br />
3) We're making this announcement on April 1st because the deal was completed today and we want to bring all services back online immediately.<br />
4) We would NEVER suspend FileFront as an April Fool's joke.<br />
5) We are happy to be back!<br />
<br />
FileFront has existed in one form or another (originally as FileLeech and Voodoo Extreme's downloads) since 1997. In the last 12 years, FileFront has become the gaming community's most comprehensive and trafficked library hosting millions of files for thousands of games while requiring no registration and providing uncapped download speeds. We look forward to improving FileFront and serving the gaming community for years to come.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's sorta what Noblegarden was to begin with, had nothing to do with Christianity.<br />
<br />
The 14th is pretty much a given at this point for the patch, between this announcement and the arena end dates. It seemed like with the decrease in Ulduar testing that they were pretty much done with 3.1 and ready to go, but it looks like they have a lot of non-Ulduar bugs they want to fix as well before releasing the patch.</div></div><hr />

^ My hypothesis as well. Blizzard already stated their intent on keeping the raid kind of more &quot;hush hush&quot; than Naxxramas was, so what better way to do that than to keep Algalon and Yoggy tested purely by their internal testers.</div></div><hr />

Theres no point in calling it 3 drake when you dont even see the other two during the encounter, its fast dps and thats great, but they're better off just saying they can kill Sarth in 76 seconds and completely skip the whole drake portion of the title.</div></div><hr />

Well ofc it's not as hard as with landed drakes, but you will still have all three debuffs, which no matter how you look at it puts a strain on the healer healing the tank. I'm not saying it's an awsome achievement they have done(well it sorta is to a degree).</div></div><hr />

The three debuffs comes the second you start the encounter. There is ONE extra debuff you get from one drake that lands and only when he opens a portal.</div></div><hr />

Its true the debuffs are up, but this strat is hardly as involved or intensive for the rest of the players like the traditional intended strat is, and from the looks of it the only raid healing that might look stressful was MT healing, unless someone decided to ride the lava wave it wasnt all that bad. Its an achievement in its own right, I just dont think you should call it Sarth 10m 3d, Im only arguing semantics here.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. When Sarth3d started, no one really had enough crazy dps, especially 7ish dps'ers in the 4k+ range to do this, and thus it was &quot;we have to figure out how to kill the 3 drakes and then kill sarth&quot;. <br />

sort of but not really. If you get all 3 debuffs at the beginning, then it is clear that all 3 drakes are alive at the start of the fight, thus just as the acheivement is worded. And as thus, it seems like it should be a legit title, accomplishment, and drake worthy kill.</div></div><hr />

No... The only one of those debuffs that require a drake to land is Twilight Torment, Twilight Torment comes when Vesperon opens a portal, you enter the portal and kill the Drake inside it.<br />
<br />
THE OTHER THREE DEBUFFS ARE UP FROM THE SECOND YOU START THE ENCOUNTER.</div></div><hr />

theyll probably make it so that any drake still alive makes him invincible if he reaches 20% or something. kinda like elder nadox and his add in old kingdom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea that makes sense, Im sure the encounter was designed around you KITING a drake and killing him before sarth enrages the twilight drakes and they kill you with a 500% damage increase and 150% attack speed increase as soon as he hits 35% HP. Im sure most tanks could take that kind of damage, no problem. Stop stepping around the wording to try and validate the strat, its not intended and its not legit, thanks.</div></div><hr />

You have about 1min and 30sec to kill him or he becomes immune, so ye they did it 14sec faster then necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Few months ago when we started putting in attempts on the encounter the thought of an only-Sarth zerg crossed my mind, but I quickly dismissed it as highly improbable. Meh. Something tells me Blizzard doesn't have any systematic approach to Unit Testing with their codebase, otherwise this shouldn't have slipped by. (Unit testing is a computer science concept, for the uninformed...)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rambaral</div><div class="date">2009-04-02, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My issue is this. Nothing is shown after Sarth dies. The WWS ends when he dies too. So unless they continued on and killed the drakes (with at least one player dead) then it's moot on what dropped and what was done after since for all we know it was a wipe. Unless it's made clear what exactly happens after he dies when the drakes are up it can't be commented on in a factual basis.<br />
<br />
The fight is about debuffs, add control, off tanking and DPSing the drakes in a certain order, and going after acolytes in the portals when certain conditions are met. If doing it this way gets it done then it is a seriously flawed encounter that will be addressed.<br />
<br />
Fact is, in a very short time it will mean nothing and while I don't think it should be achieved this way, if this is the only way you can get it done then go do it. Uldaur will be an eye opener.</div></div><hr />

Well, its not intended. But legit. Pure brutal force, no bugs or no exploits used.<br />

I'm not saying it's an exploit, I said it's a seriously flawed encounter. Just recently I read Blizz thought it was the hardest encounter in Wrath. Well no other part of the game has let you out-gear so soon, meaning it was not well though-out. Previously you had to be two tiers above the gear or 10 levels higher to zerg like this, the dps these guys are doing isn't earth-shattering, it's just not what is considered the correct party for the encounter.<br />

Im sure most tanks could take that kind of damage, no problem. Stop stepping around the wording to try and validate the strat, its not intended and its not legit, thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh, I'm stepping around the wording, that's funny. Those that did this actually followed to the letter what the acheivement said. I have a plagued proto done old school, thanks. I'm just saying grats to those who did it this way, and tried it differently that people really thought possible. How is that wrong?<br />
<br />
The only people that really matter on this subject is Blizzard. If they don't think this is a legit acheivement, then as of 3.1, I'm guessing they'll change the wording of the achievement to reflect it. If they think it's ok, then this will be a legit tactic.<br />
<br />
So they died without killing the drakes, who the F$%K cares. How did 99% of all people do &quot;When the Volcano Blows&quot; acheivement. They got nekkid, ran in front of Sarth and died at the beginning of the fight. How is that remotely hard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onfire9123</div><div class="date">2009-04-02, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This requires a huge amount of dps since (as far as I know) Shadron's disciple buts the buff on Sartharion which increases his fire and shadow dmg by 50 percent, and more importantly makes him immune to damage. Thus in order to do it this way you have to kill him BEFORE Shadron lands and spawns his disciple. So they really couldnt have done it much slower and still done it. <br />
<br />
<br />
nah. if you take shadrons portal and keep killing all the disciples(which will be tricky with tenebron still up) then you can kill sartharion after shadron lands.</div></div><hr />

Have you not done naxx with a raid that has mostly BiS items? It's a joke, at least Sarth +3 this way requires some coordination and people to actually do their jobs right, while you can screw around in naxx and still easily get the job done.

As for Naxx being easy with geared players, yes it's no longer what it was months ago but it still takes some effort and 2+ hours to clear.

<br />
What about killing Heigan before he teleports, or Noth before he teleports, or Anub'rekhan before he casts Locust Swarm, or zerging the meteor horsemen before you actually have to switch. It's all supposed to be dealed with.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2009-04-03, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone whining about mechanics<br />
<br />
So...I mean let's think about those complaints for a moment. Because people did not follow a particular fight mechanic, you claim that it isn't legit or isn't &quot;right&quot; or whatever various definition that you give for decrying this particular rush strategy. <br />
<br />
Let's use this logic for ANY other encounter in the game and tell me if this QQ still sounds a legitimate logical argument:<br />
<br />
Fighting Anub'rekhan in Naxxx and the tank not moving out of Carrion Swarm &quot;Like he's supposed to&quot;<br />
Fighting Noth and killing him before a teleport and not dealing with the groups of adds &quot;Like you're supposed to&quot;<br />
Fighting Four Horsemen in Naxx and grouping and killing Baron and Thane in front of the door without having the tanks rotate sides &quot;like you're supposed to do&quot;<br />
Just grouping Farelina and her adds on the platform and just AOE-ing everything down without dealing with mind controls and sacrifices &quot;Like you're supposed to&quot; <br />
<br />
A few other boss fights...etc etc you get the idea. <br />
<br />
So to say that this is not a legitimate tactic is wrong. It worked. The boss is dead and they did not break or avoid the coding and mechanics of the game (exploiting) to do so. 'Zerging' is as legitimate a tactic as anything else and to try and claim otherwise clearly does not make any sense given the same excuses to any other fight mechanics present in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few of simple questions for you then....why do you care how someone beats an encounter? Have you ever changed strats on a boss because someone suggested something that actually made it easier than the strat on BossKillers website? Ever zerged Heigan so hard that you didn't even have to deal with the Safety Dance? (It's a legit tactic to get the achievement. Granted, with this kind of dps, you've probably already done the fight enough to where this acheivement isn't needed anymore).<br />
<br />
Have you gotten the &quot;When the Volcano blows&quot; acheivement? And if so, how did you get it? Did you get nekkid and run in and die like 99.99% of everyone did, or was Blizz's &quot;intention&quot; for that fight for people to move around and avoid them? Yet, dying was a much simpler way to do it....thus everyone did it this way.<br />
<br />
Have you ever had to KITE a mob away from a boss before as a legit tactic....hmmm.....yeah....think Vanilla....think UBRS....General Drakkisath. <br />
<br />
Last question...why so butt hurt about the speed strat anyways?</div></div><hr />

No, it's not. It's actually pretty simple compared to many fights in the past. I take it you never fought Lady Vashj before BT came out or Kael'Thas pre-nerf? Or any of the 10's of other fights in Vanilla and TBC that actually required people to know what the fuck they were doing?<br />

Marus you gotta chill man. It's just a videogame achievement. So what if people wanna just zerg stuff. It's fun. Please don't start going all racist over how some PuG wants to kill Sarth on a particular night. I feel bad vibes comin from you. Turn off the comp, go jogging hard, get those endorphines up, and come back and take a look at your post. You're taking Sarth wayy too seriously. You definitely have a right to be disappointed if you've spent your fair share of time like most of us trying to down that mofo. <br />
<br />
<br />
People will play games in a manner that's fun to them. These people are overgeared, know how to play obviously, and are already qualified to have the achievement anyway. It's still the hardest encounter in WotLK, considering nobody posting in this thread zergs down Sarth 3D weekly like it's Archavon.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure if you tried Zerging Sarth + 3D WITHOUT you would get killed. 76 secs is a min and 10 secs that pretty damn good in my eyes. maybe my opinion doesn't mean much but gratz to ya'll who were able to push the numbers needed to rip sarth apart before the final drake landed. That's impressive to me. Yes it may seem mindless but if you actually sat down and tried it I'm sure you'd have your adrenaline pumping like mad crazy. <br />
<br />
Seriously though, who gives a rat's arse if someone decides to zerg it instead of do it &quot;the right way.&quot; I say F U to those people who think that there is NO OTHER VIABLE STRAT or &quot;Right way to do it&quot;. That is BS. Some fights are going to clean cut in how you do it, others you can tweak and play around with. If Blizzard goes &quot;Oh no!&quot; at seeing this &quot;speed&quot; fight, then they'll fix it. If they don't, then obviously they see this as being alright to do. Yes, you may not have to do some complex dance routine to get this down but at the same time...you still need intelligence. Having none usually leads to a fail raid. People say VoA is easy, and it is but I know several guild-mates who have been apart of fail ones. Not so easy when you've got retards eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 locks/mages, 1 moonkin, 1 ele shaman, 1 healer (pref shaman), 1 shadow priest, 1 tank/<br />
<br />
We did it in 82 second ( WWS report: http://wowwebstats.com/nhemmmhuhpqpm?s=16398-21682 ) by group:<br />
3 arcane mages, 1 fire mage, 1 moonkin(me), 1 elem shaman, 1 SP(respecced holy priest with average gear, some nice dps from him), 1 holy pal(with aoe-heal glyph, &quot;off-tank&quot; for fire elems), 1 prot warrior, 1 hunter(to kite add during enrage, she can one-shoot anyone with breath).<br />
<br />
Me and fire mage got the &quot;Volcano&quot; achivment during this fight :) Still trying to get it on s3d-25 by avoiding meteors...<br />
Our melee group finish him &quot;traditional way&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they shouldn't, and there's a mechanic in place to prevent kills like this,<br />
but they found a clever way around it and zerg through the enrage.<br />
<br />
When sarth reaches about 30% the drakes enrage and &quot;should&quot; wipe the raid, this is exactly to prevent the kind of kills you see in the video,<br />
they worked around it by having someone taunt and kite the drake off the main tank when it enraged, watch for it in the video at the end.<br />
<br />
If blizzard want to prevent these type of kills they can easily just buff the enrage, or make sarth enrage too if he's drakes are alive. (there's no need to extend shadron's shield to the beginning of the fight like someone suggested)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agree there isnt anything special, the warriors are lower than they should be really, the dk took his own hysteria id guess where it would have provided more dps to a warrior (checked wws he did) so he would have been below the warriors if he hadnt taken it, its really poor damage by bottom DK and the bottom warrior.<br />
<br />
Imo for a 70 second fight they should have all been higher, id have expected all 4 warriors to push to 6k np so the warrior in 4k range is a shocker.<br />
<br />
We tried it with a much more balanced set up, still avhing 4 melee though (dk two warriors enh shammy) but adding range in and its simplistic, its nice by them to make everyone realise they could do it that way but you can trust me that people will blow their time out of the water when they start trying without stacking 4 warriors.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olizandri</div><div class="date">2009-04-03, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My issue is this. Nothing is shown after Sarth dies. The WWS ends when he dies too. So unless they continued on and killed the drakes (with at least one player dead) then it's moot on what dropped and what was done after since for all we know it was a wipe. Unless it's made clear what exactly happens after he dies when the drakes are up it can't be commented on in a factual basis.<br />
<br />
The fight is about debuffs, add control, off tanking and DPSing the drakes in a certain order, and going after acolytes in the portals when certain conditions are met. If doing it this way gets it done then it is a seriously flawed encounter that will be addressed.<br />
<br />
Fact is, in a very short time it will mean nothing and while I don't think it should be achieved this way, if this is the only way you can get it done then go do it. Uldaur will be an eye opener.<br />
<br />
<br />
Adds despawn, any remaining dragons stay in air while your in combat, so we didnt wipe at least.</div></div><hr />

Your not the bottom dk, i never said your damage is poor, your warriors should break 6k and you should give hysteria to a warrior though (the greatest benefit) but isnt everyone a critic?<br />

You cant honestly excuse the dk doing 4.5k while your doing 6.2, even if you took him just for talons an enh shaman would have done far better &amp; melee would have gained more from imp str of earth totem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great...really great....<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmmm so tell me, then why did they say that they were doing it for a SPEED RUN not for getting loot nor to find new ways to &quot;exploit&quot; fights, the loot in itself was an unexpected bonus, they like most ppl are bored with content and have found a way to actually waste some time and do something that has been on the thoughts of most ppl's minds &quot;can we kill sarth before the drakes are dead them selves&quot;<br />
<br />
so that comment you just made that i quoted is retarded and should be shoved into the dustbin since you're not looking at it from their PoV, always look up facts before you spout utter nonesense.<br />
<br />
and besides, even the GM's said it was Legit so stop all the QQing, the russians got one over you so :P (a bit immature i know but it's the only way you could understand the last part Marus :P)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manosdefuego</div><div class="date">2009-04-03, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading everyone's comments I had to sit back and contemplate what everyone's point of view was on this and I finally came up with a great conclusion. You ready for this?<br />
<br />
Hypocrites. <br />
@ Everyone who is complaining about their zerging strategy....quit being hypocrites. All of you. I'm calling each one of you out. I don't have to know you all personally to state that at some point in your meaningless WoW lives you also attempted a zerging strategy on a boss and don't try to convince me or anyone else on this board that you never tried to burn a boss down at any point. Quit your QQ. You are all hypocrites.<br />
<br />
You want an analogy:<br />
This is like complaining about a first round knock out on any highly anticipated boxing fight. You believed the hype, you were fanatic about what would happen and expected a war and in the end you saw an opponent destroyed in mere seconds of the opening bell. <br />
<br />
If a fighter can knock his opponent out in the first round, does that mean that his win become illegitemate? Hell no!<br />
<br />
End result: You as a viewer were disappointed. <br />
Get over it.<br />
<br />
Gratz to all the guys who accomplished this from Russia! Please disregard all the nay-sayers and all the haters. That's exactly what they are... hAtErS. If you can burn a boss down, go for it. Period. End of story. To those complaining, quit your crying. Your hypocrisy disgusts me. <br />
<br />
Again gratz on the kill guys! I'm not going to try to belittle your accomplishment and disect your kill and hit you with the tenth degree. Great job! Ultimately, it's Blizzard's call if they would like to &quot;hot-fix&quot; this encounter, but if they did, they would need to fix every encounter in which you can currently burn any boss down.</div></div><hr />

After patch. <br />
Gz on your dps going up when using cd's, sure that's never happened to anyone else, warrior with hysteria and 70 second fight should be ending that with around 7.5k-8k dps vs the 6.2 you did mind you.</div></div><hr />

20 dps (however you'd want to stack it)<br />

sarth has roughly 10 million (due to one of the auras) and you have about 90 second to kill sarth<br />

We tried it with our guild and almost managed to land it, I have one question however:<br />
<br />
Our tank (warrior) was trying to tank the boss + the first drake at all times, but on your video we see the drake going to the tank then going somewhere in the middle of the platform, why and how ? I don't understand russian so I couldn't explore your WWS report effectively :s.<br />
<br />
Did someone in your raid &quot;taunt&quot; the first drake and then kitted him ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help !<br />

If so that kind of debunks your entire QQ in my opinion. Walking in with better gear than the encounter drops isn't really the &quot;proper&quot; way in my opinion. You're ignoring Blizzard's intended progression to stroke the epeen. Then someone finds a way to do what you're doing better than you, and the world ends! If you're going to outgear the encounter anyways, may as well make it a quick kill.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

No video available, but here's an explanation of the positioning:<br />
<br />
Tank Sarth at the far end, so that the raid stands in the far safe zone.<br />
<br />
This kill was only possible when the following happened:<br />
<br />
First wave spawns, heroism is cast. First and Second wave do not require any movement. Nobody dies to Void Zones. Shadow Priest and affliction lock take turns blowing their fears to scatter some of the adds when they start beating on the healer. We had to have the mages iceblock at the end, but we pulled it off. Soon as the drake enrages, blow shield wall and pain suppression and pray :)</div></div><hr />
