<br />
Because Blizzard wants them to start at level 20 and DKs start at level 55. So no DKs for allied races. As for Mag'har, Mag'har Death Knight is just and oxymoron. In order to become death knight you get corrupted so you can't be called uncorrupted anymore.<br />
<br />
As for Grom maybe we go back to AU but during our time, it is like almost 20 years after W3. It would make him 50 years older than we last saw him. Or maybe Mannoroth's blood dalays aging and hair greying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They say he has aged 30 years(don't know if true), while the time between the Horde started in Draenor and the events in WC3 is less than that(around 25-ish years?). His hair greyed in 5-ish years?<br />
<br />
Or they just want all the Orc-heroes to have grey hair in BfA :&gt;</div></div><hr />

WoD took place by us jumping to an alternate timeline plus 30 years in the past.<br />

<br />
I think it's because of M+, not PvP or raids. But even then it's too much, given that Tauren have AoE stun. It should at the very least be an interrupt or disorient, even if they remove the silence part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zandalari will be (for 99%, not officially confirmed but Ion said &quot;just wait and see&quot; in Q&amp;A, he would become troll level 9000 if it means that Zandalari can't be paladins), but they will be available after whole Zandalari/Kul Tiras arc. So I expect something similar to &quot;Insurrection&quot; chain in 8.1, which will reward Zandalari for Horde and Kul Tiran for Alliance (similar how &quot;War Campaign&quot; will unlock Mag'har/Dark Iron).<br />
<br />
Of course 8.1 will come relatively later than 7.1(so probably again in October) - they said 7.1 was little too soon; also such questline almost certainly will be gated. So Zandalari Paladin for Christmas is pretty good guess. ;P</div></div><hr />

I would've been cool if it were literally just an interrupt with no lockout instead of a blanket silence, but this is obviously even better. That sound you're hearing is the cries of 1500 melee cleaves everywhere as they realize they'll no longer be able to rely on having 6 different ways of interrupting the healer they're training into the ground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rendering mobs immune to silences (like bosses) does not equal &quot;redefine&quot; by any stretch of imagination.<br />

BTW, thanks Blizz, maybe I'll unsub in BFA after all.</div></div><hr />

Most likely link between Azeroth and alt Draenor was shut after WoD (it explain why they didn't help in Legion) and reopen now. But this time we are linked to alt Draenor cought to our timeline (so 35 years later), Grom become Warchief of uncorrupted Horde (Mag'har) and now he is very old (he was already old in Warcraft III, which is still more than 10 years before BfA).<br />
<br />
Still, it is mystery why the hell some Orcs want to join our Horde. If indeed (thanks to our actions), nothing invaded Draenor and there is peace between Draenei and Orcs, maybe it's just boredom.</div></div><hr />

So.. wheres the new horde paladin races? Blood elfs sre so tiny and feminin, Taurens are cool and all.. but the helms look terrible om them ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ i mean alliance got 5 races and er have 2 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly! In one of the interviews Ion said every non-hero class would have a new race for each faction. Where is the horde paladin race? I'd be less annoyed about the arcane torrent changes if there was another option for horde paladins. Taurens are the gnomes of the horde, ugly animations, look terrible in armor, and to top it off they don't fit through doors and their paladin lore is also stupid.</div></div><hr />

For the next 8 sec, damaging a target with a single-target ability deals 0 bonus Shadow damage, and healing a target with a single-target ability heals for 0 bonus healing. Each target can only be affected by this once. If you affect at least 3 targets, gain 0 Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Stamina for 20 sec. 8 sec, which transforms into Sieze the Moment! after you cast 3 different spells, granting you 0 Haste for 20 sec seconds.<br />
<br />
Rezan's Command Being attacked by an enemy of the Loa has a chance to call a Child of Rezan to grant you a blessing, healing you for 0 and increasing your primary stat by 25 for 1 min. 0 for 1 min.<br />
<br />
Ruinous Bolt Your spells and abilities have a chance to draw a Wandering Soul from Thros. The Soul will launch blasts of dark energy at your enemies, dealing 0 Shadow damage over 14 sec. When the Soul departs, it heals you for 25% 1% of the damage it dealt.<br />
<br />
<br />
umm... I fail to see how any of these three fit the Paladin class fantasy. Data mining gone wrong I hope?</div></div><hr />

That's not how it works though. Draenor was pulled into existence from the infinite timelines the bronze dragons have access to. Using that time shard thingie, it was materialized and is functioning completely as a seperate planet, just like any other. Even if we shut down the dark portal (which there's no indication of) it wouldn't change a damn thing, not to mention mages would likely still be able to acess Draenor.</div></div><hr />

Orc, Troll, Tauren...really at this point i'd say any racial.<br />
Sure, i imagine that maybe sometimes if you play at the highest possible skill level that 30 sec window where you can use your trinket after the benefit of evmfh might be useful...but honestly, i'd rather just make an orc and use their racial for burst.</div></div><hr />

Oh it's the same old hydra model, but it has the lion statue head from Stormwind, but recoloured.<br />

Orc was nerfed, undead is shit, tauren are worthless. stun removal is superior!</div></div><hr />

It is, and it was super nerfed. That's why we are having this conversation? An aoe stun is great if you are careful with DR. An aoe knockback/gap closer is amazing. WotF hasn't been nerfed the same way as EMfH so you can still break out of those effects and have trinket 30 seconds after. Orc you are right, just 20% reduction on stun isn't as good as the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mainly because Horde weren't meant to have Paladins in the first place, just the same as Alliance weren't meant to have Shamans, the race has to fit the role or it wont make sense, Undead are mostly darkness so no light for them, Orcs were always Shaman till they found out being Warlocks was cool, so no soup for you either, Trolls have the Loa and nature n shiz and goblins....well s'plosions is the nearest you will get to light there.<br />
<br />
Anyways back on topic, i thought black skinned Orcs were from the Blackhand Clan not Mag'har?</div></div><hr />
