PTR Back to Release Build<br />
Another Release flagged PTR build (15005) was pushed recently with no significant changes. Don't forget that Season 10 is ending (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205701/pvp-season-10-ending-soon)on November 29, just around the time that 4.3 should go live.<br />

Statistics: Class Balance and Dragonwrath<br />
One of the more popular requests for a Statistics post has been a class balance type of post. For the first graph we simply took the class balance for characters that have earned more than 5k Valor points, resulting in a sample size of roughly 1.8 million characters from the US and EU. This helps to remove the massive amount of alts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2552-PTR-Test-Build-Achievements-and-Honor-Kills-Steam-Compromise-Annual-Pass) we saw last time. Nothing too unexpected here, warlocks and rogues are still coming in last place. <br />
<br />
The second graph shows you how many new Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/) were created each week. The slight decrease in the last displayed week may be due to the frequency of our data updates, so regard it with some skepticism.<br />

Hi. I'm offering a sale on &quot;Sense of Humor,&quot; a magical item that is very rare in the land of Azeroth. PM me if you would like more information.<br />
<br />
Seeing as you lack this item that so many others have, it would be a very wise investment for you. Imagine all the joy it could bring you, and, more importantly, all of your friends and family!</div></div><hr />

I actualy agree with the other poster really.<br />

Daily blink used to be fun a long long time ago, but they have lost their sense of humour for a lot of episodes now.<br />
The last 20 episodes or so didn't even raise a smile here.</div></div><hr />

Hey, apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
Whats funny to you might be absolutely not funny to someone else and vice versa. relax, I found it amusing, as did many other's, I'm sure you have seen some daily blinks that I may not have found amusing. <br />

It's not the end of the world!(of warcraft) :P</div></div><hr />

Compare it to teh gladiators and.. well it's infinitely better because teh gladiators have: no punchlineno jokeno storySo if you don't get the daily blink jokes I guess you are fondling your WoW copy just a bit too much.<br />

Edit: Maybe the ones not getting the joke simply haven't played Skyrim, in that case it's a bit harder to get the joke of course...</div></div><hr />

You honestly probably have not played Skyrim or you would actually possibly would of probably laughed / Get the joke of it.<br />

I think you need to go play it then come back to this then well; It would probably make more sense to you rather then ranting about it and obviously getting ridiculed.</div></div><hr />

Currently on a train to see family when I see this comment and start laughing out loud xD Thanks for the good laughs ^.^<br />
<br />
OT: This comic really did make me laugh, having played WoW for 6 years and Skyrim for 100 hours (luckily my GF is fine with it all :D) I found it to be pretty entertaining :) I think the people who get upset just really need to lighten up, I love WoW and all but if you cannot get a little chuckle out of this and not feel the need to rush to WoWs defense I pity you :(</div></div><hr />

Hey, I like WoW too, doesn't mean I can't take a joke aimed at it. ;) Also, I'm actually surprised that Rogues and Warlocks are that low. Is it just not fun to play? Or are they not competitive anymore? Because if I recall correctly, Shaman DPS have the same problem, yet they're even above Mages. I think if you measures PvP values though, they would be very close to the top, if not on the top.</div></div><hr />

Thats a big loss on your side then... why the hate towards Skyrim? Its a singleplayer rpg like Dragon Age. You make it sound like that Skyrim will take over the mmo world even though its a SINGLEPLAYER game.<br />
<br />
I already put in about 30 hours playtime and its hilarious ... still find time to play BF3 and WoW! Goddamn fanboys, saying no to everything that hasn't a Blizzard/WoW icon.<br />
<br />
Skyrim can be played like an fps or a 3rd person game such as most of the succesful games in the industry.</div></div><hr />

As for the graph: makes sense that Druids and Paladins are at the top due to their diversity of roles, but I'm surprised that Shamans are higher than Mages, for example. It feels like every third toon in Stormwind is a Mage (and probably arcane spec).<br />
<br />
That's because Shamans are hybrids. Hybrids are really two or three classes rolled into one, and that is also why druids and paladins are ahead of the others becuase they are three or even four classes rolled into one.<br />
<br />
Pures are lagging, and mages and hunters will probably lose &quot;market share&quot; in MoP and become more similar to rogue and lock in having fewer followers because they will be even more homogenized. Basically it seems mage is going to be three identical specs, except that the graphics for the spells will have a frosty, firy or arcany look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do one for Dragonwrath by mainspec caster? #Dragonwraths by class and % w/Dragonwrath by Mage/Lock/Shadow/Balance/Elemental characters with Firelands and 25k VP achieves (5k is nothing, my alts get that a few weeks after hitting 85, and all my actually played 85s have killed Rag so just Firelands achieve doesn't eliminate them either). <br />
<br />
I know the raw numbers are something like this, for US: <br />
Dragonwrath: ~3000 <br />
Mage: ~1100 <br />
Warlock: ~750 <br />
Spriest: ~650 <br />
Boomkin: ~350 <br />
Elemental: ~140 <br />
<br />
I also know there are more Mages than Elemental Shaman, and that Mage is an entire class not a spec, so don't flame me, but with 8x more Dragonwraths, I'm curious by what % raiding Mages outnumber raiding Ele Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm curious to find out how many Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest staff exist in top10 guilds.<br />
<br />
Judging from WoWprogress top gearscores by realm, guilds like Paragon, Method, Vodka have 9-10. <br />
<br />
Stars has, last I checked*, the most, with an astounding 18.<br />
*roflmao I just checked again and they're up to 22 - 7 Mages, 7 Locks, 5 Druids, 3 Priests, 0 Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Out of the pure dps classes mages are 2nd, its not surprising that classes with multiple roles (tank/dps, heals/dps or all 3) are above mages. I think we all know what the graph would look like if mages had tank and healing specs... :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You still need some very good gear to do competitive dps as warlock comparing to lets say mages and dks. And not to mention the<br />
skillcap which is obviously alot higher. But thats another discussion.<br />
<br />
Seeing locks and rogues being lowest is not surprising at all since those are two of the hardest classes to master currently in the game<br />
compared to paladins for example. Its all there in the stats :)<br />

The Daily Blink really needs to stop making stuff. They clearly have lost any of the wit and humor they 'used' to have. All I get from that comic is that &quot;LOLZ SKYRIM IS BTRRER TAN WIW&quot; Justify it all you want, but even if it's an &quot;unfair and unreasonable&quot; (and I'll personally add in uneducated) comparison, they could have at least tried to make wow sound better than they did<br />

Because a single person's opinion is cold hard facts? Right? It is funny. Because even the positive stuff about Skyrim in that comic are grossly exaggerated. So even while making fun of WoW they are making fun of Skyrim. This DB is an example of what every &quot;fanboy/fangirl&quot; does to their beloved games. They make &quot;their&quot; game sound super exciting and down play any game that isn't theirs. As seen in this quote:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I mean that makes WoW sound amazing. But, in reality, those things happen for maybe 5 quests (With the exception of the Undead, that's the ENTIRE Silverpine quest experience). In WoW you have collect bat shit. In Skyrim you have to deliver &quot;love letters&quot; to make a woman choose a man. WOW! OMG BOTH ARE EXCITING! Not really. <br />
<br />
What you should do, and this is just a suggestion, is not take it so personally.</div></div><hr />

It's a graph of NEW staves not how many people total owned the staff. So by the 1st of Nov 1121 people had recieved the staff, between the 1st of Nov and the 8th of Nov only 1062 people got the staff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It clearly says the graph is about how many people get the staff per week.-</div></div><hr />

Shaman placing higher than warrriors or death knights. I can see them placing fairly high due to being a healer with two very different styles of dps to choose from for offspecs, but to place ahead of two tanks caught me a little by suprirse, even ahead of hunters is a little bit of a surprise.<br />
<br />
This shouldn't really be a suprise if you think about it. One of the reasons that tanks are so hard to come by in 5man groups is because they are the least needed spec (in terms of how many you need, not how important they are) in 10man and 25man. Some/most encounters in 10 man require at least 3 healers, 5 DPS and only 2 tanks. The difference in ratio is even higher when you get to 25man - where you need more healers, more DPS but still only 2 tanks. This means that there are far more people with DPS or healing as their main specs than there are tanks (and since people mainly queue for RDF as their main spec, this helps create the &quot;tank bottleneck&quot; we get for randoms). Therefore it's not suprising, really, that the two tank classes who don't have healing-spec options, have a lesser showing than any class with DPS and Healing as their two options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do one for Dragonwrath by mainspec caster? #Dragonwraths by class and % w/Dragonwrath by Mage/Lock/Shadow/Balance/Elemental characters with Firelands and 25k VP achieves (5k is nothing, my alts get that a few weeks after hitting 85, and all my actually played 85s have killed Rag so just Firelands achieve doesn't eliminate them either). <br />
<br />
I could do it by class, but if you already have the numbers it wouldn't be very interesting. Doing it by spec is harder, as everyone has two specs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5000 valor points is a pretty low threshold, isn't it? Most of my level 85 alts have at least that. (And most of my alts can heal or tank, perhaps skewing the results a bit.)<br />
<br />
Yup, just wanted to remove the professions alts and such mostly. People clearly asked for more graphs at more valor levels, so I will try and get that in the followup!</div></div><hr />

No, it would not be dropping next week in the middle of a major holiday for part of it's playerbase. Patches typically release right around the time PvP Seasons end, but to release it Thanksgiving week would be interpreted by many Americans as &quot;Choose: Family or Blizzard!&quot; much to a resounding tide of QQ. And, I'd personally doubt they'd put themselves willingly into such a sh!tstorm (granted, prior experience may not always hold this as true) as well as have the 'B/C Team' on hand while major bugs get ironed out during said holiday week (as employees likely would have to 'choose' too).<br />
<br />
Besides, what's another 2 weeks? If people are that bored, there are many a game you can otherwise play or even take a mini-sabbatical.</div></div><hr />

good point i want a answer to this<br />
Historically, a patch goes live when a PvP season ends. So patch 4.3 is expected to be released the same day that the PvP season has been tentatively scheduled to end, which is November 29.<br />

<br />
I love your &quot;unfair and unreasonable&quot; (and I'll personally add in uneducated) logic. I'll help you crawl out of that ignorant uneducated hole your stuck in. This type of logic is called a Fallacy. It's generalized by incorrect arguments used to make a misconception or presumption. Your example being this isn't funny to me, therefor it isn't a joke. Just because you have no sense of humor when people make fun of a game you love, doesn't mean others can't laugh when the joke is hilarious.<br />

<br />
<br />
Understood, but most people I know, and (I'd think) most people I'd be trying to sample, log out in their primary spec. You'd probably get a few Resto Shaman logged in their dailies spec, and a few Ele Shaman logged in their PvP spec. There's no way to make it perfect, but it would be close. As far as the raw numbers, yeah I think I have a pretty good idea what it'd look like, but I wouldn't mind seeing a graph on your front page showing exactly how (im)balanced the ranged casters were in this legendary cycle.</div></div><hr />

There will be some variance because of things like how many people enjoy the theme of a class, or how powerful the class currently is, but most of it will have to do with how many roles that class can be. It's why Rogue and Warlock is so low. Mage and Hunter are only slightly below 2-role classes, though. We all know that Mage is crazy high because of how strong it is (and, let's face it, it's the Mage class. A lot of people in the MMORPG community are obsessed with playing THE mage, in any game). Hunter? Let's face it, people want to be elven archers.</div></div><hr />

The unpopularity of warlocks and rogues is mostly unrelated to balance. These classes have always been unpopular because the playstyles are unusual, and don't have the natural appeal of more generic classes. Someone who wants pets or spells is likely to pick hunter or mage, not warlock. Someone who wants melee isn't going to pick rogue unless the whole &quot;stealth and cooldowns&quot; thing is exactly what they want; they'll pick warrior or DK or some hybrid instead. There are some balance issues too, but they aren't the reason the classes are unpopular. <br />

<br />
To clarify the graph is representing staffs per week, not an accumulated total.<br />
<br />
He's suggesting the dip on the final week data point on the 8th of Nov (1062) from the previous and highest on the 1st of Nov (1121) is due to a burst from all the 10man guilds finally able to finish the quest, frankly I agree. I predict there will be a similar behaviour in 7-8 weeks from then when they complete their 2nd.</div></div><hr />

That's the current set of obtainable legendaries multiplied by each class and spec's class distribution. The introduction of the new Fangs of the Father legendaries will put Rogue to 8% and shove everyone else down 2/17ths of a percent. Tanking legendaries now?</div></div><hr />

I have no idea what your logic there is. Cat and Bear are at 6%, but Prot Warrior and 1h Fury are at 0%? <br />
How in Thrall's name does Thunderfury not count for Prot Warrior (That's how I was introduced to it, and I'm sure many many many more: as a tanking weapon), but Sulfuras counts for Feral? Hunters are the second highest? If you're actually counting Thunderfury for Hunters and not shield tanks, I tip my hat to you sir, that graph took some serious balls...because that's the most ludicrous bald-faced lie I think I've ever seen presented in graph form.<br />

Such ignorance in this post :| All it was meant to do is make people laugh and a lot of people got a good laugh, your post makes it seem like you have a personal grudge against Skyrim. I played and enjoy both, playing WoW for 7 years and I understand that the comparison is horrible but they did it that way to make people laugh. Though that is all your opinion which I cannot say is wrong, but a lot of people have enjoyed it so I am at least inclined to say that your opinion is just very negative.</div></div><hr />
