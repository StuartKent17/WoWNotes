People like that are why we can't have good things...<br />
<br />
If they had been like that when Warcraft 2 came out, we would never have gotten Warcraft 3, or WoW...oh, look! they are making remake of WC3 instead of giving us a WC4!...<br />
<br />
and what is it with all the nay-sayers that mmo's aren't popular anymore? Just look at the numbers of people flocking to wow classic, and the people watching on twitch...</div></div><hr />

The Mech is Mecha Tyrael, a skin from Heroes of the Storm for the Archangel Tyrael. <br />
The Science Guy is Egon Stetmann, a Terran Scientist once part of Jim Raynor's &quot;Raynor's Raiders&quot; (Starcraft).</div></div><hr />

No, Barbarian, a representative of Diablo. Tracer for Overwatch, Sylvanas for Wow, Elis Starseeker for Hearthstone, I assume the &quot;Plated Sword wielder&quot; is for Heroes of the Storm, and the Scientist looking guy for Startcraft franchises respectively.</div></div><hr />

I’m not saying they are announcing a new game - but they would never put a new IP on the cover art before announcing it. It’s not like Overwatch was the key art for its announcement year.</div></div><hr />

Do you seriously expect them to reveal new games via the key art, nearly two full months before Blizzcon?<br />
<br />
Expectations are that they'll announce, at the least, a new Overwatch game, Diablo IV, and a new WoW expansion.</div></div><hr />

So they didn't include art for their mobile games? That would just have made people not wanting to show up...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KainneAbsolute</div><div class="date">2019-09-06, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Barbarian at the center - the rumored second expansion for diablo 3 was going to be more about the barbarians. Some material was released but probably they are saving some ideas for Diablo 4. It is also true that the barbarian was a main face on Diablo Inmortal BUT the design is different from D:I trailer.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas - 8.3 and the war continues. Maybe Sylvanas sotry will lead us to Shadowlands.<br />
<br />
Tracer - the leak abour overwatch 2/overwatch story mode is true.<br />
<br />
Stetman from SC2: the scientist from Raynor´s crew. Crazed but Terrazine and creator of the mecha swarm. The a new commander. However, Stetman´s beard is longer than the Commander. Maybe Stetman keeps studyins the Zerg and discovered the Adostra??? Maybe a new campaign? Maybe new cosmetics? <br />
<br />
Mecha Tyrael from HoS. Mechastorm was the last event on Heroes of the Storm.If you completed the quests you will get the mecha Tyrael skins. Maybe they will continue the events and announce a new hero. <br />
<br />
Heartstone character - more info about HS expansion, mechanics ad probably new game modes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sylvanas looks like in her Warbringer video.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone is from the latest expansion.<br />
<br />
HotS is from the latest Mecha event.<br />
<br />
Barbarian I am not sure really, likely just teaser for Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
Tracer is just overall Overwatch face.<br />
<br />
And Starcraft 2 is the last Commander they released.<br />
<br />
So are they going to keep things more hidden regarding what they plan to release or are they just using things they released to secretly tease what they plan?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if one could surmise anything from that picture, if anything that would be &quot;no new IP&quot;, but they could easily make a new game on existing IP, which is even very likely to happen. New Diablo, perhaps new Overwatch.<br />
<br />
But one can't even get that from such a picture. How stupid would they be to put their big reveal onto a poster like this?</div></div><hr />

But would they reveal it on the key art...? I'd imagine they'd want control over the the hype at the spot and from the announcement, putting hints up = players speculate and hype beyond compare and then they're disappointed when the actual announcement happens.<br />

Glad to see some news that are not about you-know-what though. About time.<br />

Diablo Immortal is for the mobile market. Fans of the real game want new content for the game for the PC. <br />

Yeh starcraft will definitely be getting a phone game and that scientist guy will be the one to tell you &quot;Jim Raynor needs your help! All he needs is your credit card number the expiration date and the 3 numbers on the back!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fuck are people expecting from the key ary? &quot;Nothing new and exciting&quot; ?! It's not supposed to be new and exciting LOL. It is supposed to feature one EXISTING (and thus recognizable) character for each game that will have presence during the event. Diablo character taking the spotlight (being the largest and being in the middle) = big Diablo announcement. Overwatch character standing in the very front also = important announcement. WoW has a guaranteed expansion. How much more exciting can it get lol...</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Sylvanas being on the key art. The Blizzcon they announced WoD had Garrosh as the key art character, the gamescom they announced Legion had Gul'dan, and the Blizzcon they announced BfA had Jaina... Oh, there was also the pandaren on the key art for the year MoP was announced. But that one was hidden and they didn't confirm it was meant to be a pandaren until after the announcement (though many speculated it was beforehand). Each time the character is a major driving force of the new expansion's plot this could imply the next one will have her be the main hero or villain of whatever it's about as well.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's pretty much what I said. Sylvanas has barely appeared outside of the beginning just like Jaina in Legion and if the shadowlands has Arthas as the main villain, then we will get more development in that part.</div></div><hr />

I have to wonder, though, why they didn't pick a more recognizable character like Sarah Kerrigan or Jim Raynor. They did so with Warcraft and Overwatch...<br />
<br />
Raynor and Kerrigan are gone. I assume the stuff in the art is all relevant to things going forward. Egon is still around and addicted to Terrazine, which seems important in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think its partially due to Egon being one of the newer released Co-op commanders. I believe co-op is still relatively (considering SC2 popularity). Hope to see them actually do something new with the SC 2 IP, a mobile game would be fine imo, people aren't pining for SC3 like they were for D4.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kallisto</div><div class="date">2019-09-07, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, no new games...<br />
<br />
This is what depressing me about wow classic, the popularity shows people are yearning for blizzard to deliver something people don't currently have...<br />
<br />
...worst are the people who are directly against new games &quot;then it would invalidate everything i have done in the current game!&quot;...yeah, but u could still play the old game...<br />
People like that are why we can't have good things...<br />
<br />
If they had been like that when Warcraft 2 came out, we would never have gotten Warcraft 3, or WoW...oh, look! they are making remake of WC3 instead of giving us a WC4!...<br />
<br />
and what is it with all the nay-sayers that mmo's aren't popular anymore? Just look at the numbers of people flocking to wow classic, and the people watching on twitch...<br />
<br />
TBH new games need to be a surprise. No point showing them on this. It would be like having this a few months before Overwatch was announced with Tracer front and centre on the logo when you want to surprise people. <br />
<br />
(Not saying they'll be new IP or games, but best not to blow the load before Blizzcon. Especially when the fan base would rather listen to &quot;OMG THIS IS TOTALLY HAPPENING AT BLIZZCON!!!&quot; by kotaku/polygon etc instead of your own official tweets of &quot;No it's not happening, don't come here expecting it.&quot; that blizzard did for months over D4 rumours.)</div></div><hr />

My point stands.<br />

<br />
*Speculation*<br />
Overwatch 2 <br />
Diablo 4<br />
HOTS (New char)<br />
SC (new stuff)<br />
WoW (new expan sylvanis looks depressed) <br />
Hearthstone (new expan/cards) <br />
<br />
Might be a decent Blizzcon for trailers.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping! Well, the new expansion reveal for WoW is a guarantee, but Diablo 4 man...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're saying that as if she hasn't always been Disney Princess-esque. BfA just made it more obvious by making her look like Elsa with a bad attitude.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Saurfang: well Blizz seems to have a weakness for genocidal maniacs. :D<br />
<br />
Fair, but my point was if putting Sylvanas on this year's commemorative art means they're obsessed with her then they're obsessed with Saurfang and Jaina too (as well as whoever else they might put on the commemorative art).<br />
<br />
Besides, Blizzard might love Sylvanas, but they love honorable(™) orcs more.</div></div><hr />

Could be...could also just be her Banshee smoke form like what was in the trailer for BfA.<br />

<br />
Barbarian looks like it could either be the Immortal or 3 version.<br />
I think the main thing is they just picked representatives from each game, not so much as what to expect going forward. Just a “we have news about these games, here’s some familiar faces!” If they had put Raynor or Kerrigan, who I’ve read are done in the game at this point, people would expect something with them and not just a Starcraft update with putting the guy in there they have.<br />
Tracer is just a common face or Overwatch, much like the Barbarian from Diablo.<br />
The NE from Hearthstone is probably the same thing as Starcraft, with Blizzard not wanting to put in a prominent well known character for fear of people reading into some new Warcraft reveal. <br />
As far as Tyrael? Maybe just a “look, we still have HotS. Don’t forget that!”</div></div><hr />

I mean, she's a frikkin mass murderer with no concience whatsoever. Why is everyone so keen on glorifying psychopaths nowadays? I just don't get it. There's nothing &quot;morally grey&quot; about Sylvanas. She's not a &quot;misunderstood&quot; hero.<br />
<br />
It's funny how Blizz is complaining about the &quot;toxic&quot; playerbase while encouraging the kids to be hyped for utter assholes.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard encouraged tribalism and &quot;toxicity&quot; with their constant hyping of the 2 factions for years, nothing new here really.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astalnar</div><div class="date">2019-09-09, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you seriously expect them to reveal new games via the key art, nearly two full months before Blizzcon?<br />
<br />
Expectations are that they'll announce, at the least, a new Overwatch game, Diablo IV, and a new WoW expansion.<br />
<br />
I expect Diablo announcement will be that it's coming to PC after all. Cuz you guys don't have smart phones ...<br />
<br />
WoW expansion is a must at this point, if not for anything else, because Activision demands it.</div></div><hr />

Come on, the barbarian is a classic character as is fucking and obnoxious tracer, those are all over the internet. <br />
<br />
Shit like some scientist of a dead game, an obscure Tyrael skin in a an even deader game or some bs heartstone charcter I can get though, I had no idea who those were either.</div></div><hr />

Starcraft looks interesting , maybe they decided to finally released the mmo version. Overwatch announcement will probably focus more on the switch and maybe your phone .=P Diablo might be added to more systems if not announcing a new expansion since they aren't ready for diablo4 yet. Or they could be releasing like a nova corps thing for diablo with a little bit of new content.</div></div><hr />

I'm a big fan of tentacle boi, so o really hoped he front his own expansion, a real big Black Empire returned thing, rather the cover half an expansion. But interested to see where they take death themed expansion!<br />
<br />
They have bwonsamdi (and his boss), the other death loa, helya, whatever took oydns eye and the lich king as all viable areas. It should be lorewise a real hoot</div></div><hr />
