I want them to kick the people that make the story and gameplay for the game and hire New passionate ones. Also, i didn't use the Word &quot;more&quot;.

They have just hired new people for the story and with how much things like the in game and out of the game cinematic’s have improved they seem rather passionate.<br />

Creativity also isn’t lacking they were plenty creative with the azerite armour rather it was a good thing or not is up in the air.</div></div><hr />

You can't please all the people all of the time, sadly. You'll often find it's different people complaining, it's just so common that it feels like it's everyone complaining all of the time.<br />

You do know that classic has the same sub as the retail does, you can't have one without the other. With your logic this would be a panic to get more subs to classic. You're a cool guy.</div></div><hr />

This is still an MMO, people play it for years. The majority of time is spend for collecting stuff. <br />
<br />
What I see from new players starting in LEGION or BfA is playing WoW exclusively for raiding or pvping because they get told to do nothing else. At least the burn-out rate is skyhigh so this part of the community is getting repeatedly replaced after a few months. <br />
<br />
Raiding/PvPing 24/7, spending endless time for months doing things in the game you dont really enjoy just to acknowledge that nobody really cares what YOU DO IN YOUR GAMING TIME is the saddest thing to watch in any MMO.<br />
<br />
Honestly I blame streamers and the lack of subjective community sites for this. Playing any MMO for instant gratification will never work, since MMOs are made for endless gaming. If you don't have FUN playing the game, doing whatever you like, there is no point in playing the game at all.<br />
<br />
MMO's got only endless grind for character progression or endless grind for collections and honestly I preffer the gear resets in WoW much more and the endless grind is only there for collecting stuff and thats clearly optional since you wrote your statement even wondering why such thing would be a major point in this MMO. Blizzard implemented this core MMO feature really good and as casual friendly as it goes.</div></div><hr />

Introduce a handful of unique mounts, toys, and pets as rewards, thereby making obtaining them a tangible, in-game accomplishment instead of the &quot;easy content&quot; of simply putting in multiple recolors of everything.<br />
<br />
You rather want them to make less content? You want us to have less things to do?<br />
<br />
various colors on the mounts is a good thing, people can choose what look they prefer instead of being stuck in one color. You dont HAVE to collect the same mount in each color you know.</div></div><hr />

The neck is getting updated right? that kind of makes me curious I admit, but iirc when it was first announced a couple months ago streamers were saying it was pretty shallow, which lowered my excitement dramatically, but I admit I haven't really personally checked into it as of late to see the final product.<br />
<br />
On the other hand some of you are acting like we should be grateful for them throwing us a dozen pets/mounts and calling it a day is concerning. I like my RPGs to have actual progression installed, both in the environment around me and my character itself, not just my collection of cosmetic rewards yawn. What's actually new in 8.2? The raid? The neck? I know new zones, but what do you do in those zones? More world quests?</div></div><hr />

But now that my poor soul has gained your attention, could you please enlighten me on how Blizzard are addressing the character progression, gearing and balancing on this mysterious post?<br />
<br />
They already made posts about gearing, balancing and charecter progression...<br />
does literally every single blue post have to be about gameplay for you?<br />
been doing tons of posts recently about class changes and balancing plans. like the minopr glimmar nerfs, random class balancing, and arms warrior buff<br />

<br />
literally a week ago mate, do you want them to just... repost that exact same blue post every single day or something?<br />

Blue post on gearing and there are many others about class balance or character progression around the essences if you want me to link them.<br />

Can't help but wonder if the content can even support or justify that ridiculous amount of mounts<br />
<br />
They really don’t need a lot of content to support mounts look at nagrand as an example you could get a ton of talbuks.</div></div><hr />

I'll chime in and say this:<br />
Blizzard is trying to adress some glaring issues, such as lack of targeted gear rewards, and a new system to become more powerful with Essences, since Azerite gear failed spectacularly when it comes to replacing tier sets, legendaries and artifact weapon progression.<br />
<br />
Problem is that the game is still stuck in play-the-patch mode, and the idea that anything even close to dangerous is confined to high end raids or m+. <br />
In 8.2, and in future patches, your characters will keep getting drowned in free catchup gear, so that they are ready for the latest patch. <br />
So players are now getting targeted gear (Benthic) and a new progression system (Essences), but they will feel as hallow as everything else. <br />
You don't need to become more powerful because you are a god from day 1 anyway. The only thing Benthic gear upgrades and powerful Essences will accomplish in practice is that you'll be overkilling for higher numbers are you mow everything down.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW has been tainted by modern game design. It has to be fast, über-accessible, action packed, and hopefully keep you paying long enough to pay for itself. 8.2 content will be cleared within 2 weeks tops. And since it's &quot;seasonal&quot;, that is it. Frontloaded weekly rewards then a bunch of grinds that doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

What do you actually want instead?<br />
<br />
I can't think of any content that isn't consumed in 2 weeks tops by the nolifers (and let's admit here that WoW has quite a lot of those, they will also be the loudest shouting for new content). Blizzard tried spreading the content over 11 weeks in Legion... guess what that also wasn't good because &quot;timegating reeeeeeeee&quot;.<br />
<br />
So really: which kind of content would satisfy you that's neither frontloaded, nor über-accassible, not seasonal and of course also not a bunch of grinds?</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I'm not saying I don't like a mount or two for the looks, but it's definitely fluff, fill content to pad the &quot;Look at what we have to offer!&quot; and not substance content, which is severely lacking.<br />

Leveling which is difficult and immersive and a class leveling system which is interesting enough to justify it. PvP with vendors and a long and satisfying gear progression. Linear Raids which build upon one another and don’t become dead content in 4 months. Actually difficult world content. Reputations and dailies that unlock content as you progress, modeled after past successful content patches such as molten front and isle of queldanas. I could go on.</div></div><hr />

why do you play a game like wow?<br />
to obtain things and to beat bosses<br />
beat bosses good, and obtain things<br />
obtain things like cool mounts, and pets, and toys...<br />

I want to go into new content and actually *need* better gear in order to succeed. I won't need Benthic gear or Essences in 8.2 because my character is a demigod ingame until I go into heroic raiding. You don't need better gear in a Theme Park MMO and I want WoW to go back to a design where, sure when new content is released you are most likely going to have some success but if you had great gear from the raid prior you had a head start. <br />
<br />
Now, you are never actually hindered by your gear or anything. All content is designed so that you will succeed on the first attempt.<br />
I want content longevity to also depend on my investment into my character. Instead every major update is a total reset.<br />

Lol, BFA is terrible for casual players. <br />
The game isn't automatically &quot;casual friendly&quot; because it removes all difficulty from the game.<br />
<br />
I was a casual player, because I didn't (want to) raid or had a m+ group. <br />
But since BFA is designed so that I can faceroll through literally all PvE content in three afternoons, I unsubbed. BFA is the first expansion that made it clear that this game does not provide any long-lasting content for non-serious raiders. You don't even care about gear in this would-be mmorpg because you are already overpowered.But hey, at least you have a heavily CRZ'd Boralus to keep up the illusion that a lot of people still play BFA :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Vanilla guilds ran old raids concurrently with the current raid anyway. Not all gear was replaced by the next raid. It wasn’t “damn we had one person leave, now we have to start farming MC”. Guilds were already farming MC. This made the system friendly for new players to tag along for farm. Plus, the 40 person raid size gave far more room for error, it was expected you would be carrying 5-10 people anyway. <br />

When was the last time you actually needed good gear if you weren’t raiding? Mabye in tbc? From warth on you haven’t needed high end gear to clear world content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2019-06-07, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When was the last time you actually needed good gear if you weren’t raiding? Mabye in tbc? From warth on you haven’t needed high end gear to clear world content.<br />
<br />
And now you barely even have to have gear equipped to clear world content. <br />
It's designed so that a green geared new level 120 who happened to ding on 8.2 will be able to get far in Nazjatar.<br />
<br />
There's two different kind of &quot;needs&quot; here so I'll clear this up. You will most likely never find a point where you literally couldn't clear the newest world content if you didn't have gear from the latest raid (ignoring LFR), but you struggled with the gear you had. When there's a struggle, you appreciate the catch up gear you get.<br />
<br />
Of course, even in non-raid available gear, you could eventually clear the new world content that was released. Raid-geared players naturally had an advantage and that advantage made a difference. Maybe one important rare quest mob was so hard a raid-geared character could do it with some effort, while someone without maybe needed a group or team up with one more to do so.<br />
Now both of these will faceroll. The barrier of entry is so low that nothing you gained in 8.1 will make a significant difference. The raider will just obliterate things slightly faster.<br />
<br />
When I say I want a &quot;need&quot; for better gear, that necessitates that the new content is balanced to be pretty tough if you don't have good gear. You'll be able to clear it with effort, but every gear upgrade will feel that much sweeter as the enemies start dying quicker.<br />
But Blizzard favors making everyone powerful enough on day 1 (by making world mobs/elites etc weak) so that it's more accessible.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is all just one piece of the core issue that WoW has that has culminated with BFA. It's top- and bottomheavy to the point where the only content where gear and upgrades actually makes a difference, is heroic/mythic raids or high m+, the kind of content casual players don't do. BFA is such a shallow experience for non-raiders (that included me), because all content is frontloaded, with things like Warfronts being literally designed so that you win.</div></div><hr />

This just seems false in my experience. When Argus came out I had a friend who came back to the game wearing rags and he couldn’t clear any thing easily as a rouge, i while not being raid geared had stuff from the argues venders and could clear every thing. The same thing then happened in bfa when he tried to take the same rougue to arathi and pretty much got one shot by some rares because again he was wearing fresh 120 garbage.<br />
<br />
I could probably finish levelling a new character and try my self but what you are saying just seems to be a bunch of bull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
There are less than a handful of things that Vanilla raiding did better than current, the raidprogress situation certainly isn't one of them. It's just a good thing that we had stuff like Tier 0.5, PvP vendor gear and ZG/AQ20 for the catchup assist.<br />

Mythic guilds in retail still have to find someone with a max neck and traits.<br />
<br />
It mattered less in vanilla when a person was carried but it was still shit going back to do content that was old and obsolete for everyone else other than the handful you were boosting. It was much worse in TBC and later because of the raid sizes being a little less forgiving in regards to how many people needed to actually do their job.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't posts all the new toys, pets, and mounts available next patch - people complain.<br />
<br />
The ones complaining are the ones who don't treat WoW like a collection simulator. Those that do should go play Skyrim. WoW needs class fixes and shit, not mounts, pets and toys.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's just me but I would prefer having a lot less mounts, but they are really rare so you want to grab them and use them. Show them off to your friends and other people on your server. These things most people will probably never even use, just adding to their hoarding of mount collections.</div></div><hr />

One thing I really liked about WotLK was that the Proto-drakes were that. They were all difficult to obtain in their own way and each offered a nice recolour that stood out in a crowd.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see every expansion have their &quot;one super awesome mount&quot; with recolours for different kinds of content. Like the MoP Phoenixes if they weren't all from Challenge Mode Dungeons.</div></div><hr />

I used to farm mounts up until WoD, but I got demotivated when all I could farm was overpriced recolours. Legion was a bit better but BfA regressed and it is worse than ever. Mount collecting today is just about keeping gold inflation down and selling token for Blizzard. Too bad.</div></div><hr />

Oh absolutely. And then there were recolours of normal mounts but they were also exciting because they otherwise belonged to the OTHER faction, but so hard to get. Rivendare's Mount (Forsaken mounts), Zulian Tiger (Night Elf sabers).</div></div><hr />

<br />
what? are you not exalted with all the rep yet?<br />
<br />
also there is only 1 updated gryphon mount right now, so to go from 1 mount with that colour, to 4 is very nice, more choice is always better.<br />
i love the updated gryphon, but i hate how there is only ONE meaning you HAVE to use that colour.<br />

<br />
so question.<br />
what is the difference between 5 rare mounts that you can show off.<br />
or 20 mounts, with 5 of them being rare that you can show off.</div></div><hr />

I think some people still see mounts as a prestige item from back in the day. I know when I played it was all a matter of what type of mech I wanted to ride that day...<br />

ATM several of Dota heroes have a deeper and more complex gameplay than any WoW spec. It's just sad :(</div></div><hr />

Recently (about the last 3 months ) I finally manage to wake my self up and stop playing this Activision nonsense.<br />
For all the players out there they are MAKING FUN of us without any convenience about wow base fan community...<br />
Every time the same thing mounts toys grind rep to be able to get this, that …..they just toying around with us.<br />
As for me I am a proud ff14 player and trust me I FEEL so nice when I am playing in the world of Eorzea….<br />
I am not advertising at all final fantasy but ….. as a former Wow fan player I can surely say that Activision is just toying around with the SAME THINGS everytime…<br />
Log in to do emissary(emissary has same ilvl as HC RAIDING) do fast my daily conquest (GET ilvl same with MYTHIC RAIDING OMG) do a +dungeon fast because we are ina hurry with no reason<br />
and then stay online in a spot without knowing what to do. <br />
Routine..fucking routine</div></div><hr />
