Reasons behind the removal of Crashin' &amp; Trashin' from Merrymaker<br />
For players who weren't there when this gift was given out, it's, well, kind of hard to get. We have plans to fix this in the future but they weren't implemented in time for this year's event. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21559816287-blues-why-remove-crashin--thrashin-from.html))<br />
<br />
Icecrown 5-Man and Random Dungeons<br />
I actually got one of them when I was doing the testing on the PTR, so yes, they are part of the table. One thing to keep in mind though is that you have to unlock the Halls of Reflection by doing the Pit of Saron and the Pit of Saron is locked until you do the Forge of Souls. I was not able to queue for locked two dungeons until I opened them up so that probably locks them from the random heroic rotation as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21559516266-33-icecrown-5mans-as-random-dungeon.html))<br />
<br />
Trash mobs in Wrath of the Lich King raids<br />
A lot of players have an impression of Wrath of the Lich King trash tanking as the tank spamming their AE moves while the raid uses Fan of Knives, Blizzard, Volley, Hurricane, Mind Sear, etc. This wasn't necessarily something we set out to do. We buffed warrior and druid AE threat abilities in response to paladins having such an easy time of it throughout Burning Crusade. At the same time we also buffed a lot of the AE spells, particularly for those classes / specs that didn't have good ones.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call this is a stirring victory though. It meant that crowd control was irrelevant on a lot of fights. It was important on say Freya or Vezax trash before everyone became so overgeared, but our raid trash didn't feel at all like the BC raid trash (which is both good and bad I suppose). Likewise, classes with a lot of ramp up time (e.g. warlocks, Shadow priests) or whose most interesting mechanics really only kick in on single targets (e.g. combo points) just didn't have as much fun on the AE extravaganza.<br />
<br />
A better design might be that you use e.g. Thunderclap when a group of adds spawn in, but you don't keep applying Thunderclap over and over to lock them down. (This is a little bit of a bad example because there are other reasons to use Tclap obviously). Instead, you tank maybe a 1-4 adds while the raid CCs and then burns down single targets at a time. Vezax trash generally worked like this. TK and SSC trash certainly worked like this. Now not every trash pull has to be the same. It's fine to have say the Solarian trash that you're clearly supposed to just AE down and can't effectively tank all at once. It's fine if groups shift more to AE when the instance is truly on farm. The majority of tanking abilities are just designed around the assumption of tanking 1-2 things at once though, so AE tanking just doesn't have much depth. (Surprise: sort of how AE dps and healing don't have as much depth.)<br />
<br />
I suspect too that our encounter design has probably adjusted to fit the current state of things, so I wouldn't worry that Cataclysm is going to constantly bombard you with large add groups while your DnD is on cooldown and your group constantly calls you a bad tank for not being able to manage the adds. Related, runes on cooldown works out as a reasonable gating mechanism overall, but I'm not sure the emergency buttons are doing what they should. Things like Blood Tap need to be more about &quot;Oops, I have no runes for DnD, but I really need it this instant.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21333888680-are-dk-tanks-going-to-get-a-buff-soon.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking class disparities<br />
I would agree with most of this, though I wouldn't use that tone of course. I feel like the heart of the matter here is your definition of &quot;easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does easier mean he wipes less than you? If so, this is a big problem. I don't think it's happening though.<br />
Does easier mean you don't need the same amount of gear? This is a slightly smaller problem, though I'll point out again that the server firsts are typically done with very little new gear, which reinforces that skill and coordination can outweigh big gear disparities.<br />
Does easier mean you have to work a little harder at playing your class?<br />
Does easier mean the healers have to work harder?<br />
Does easier mean your group can have a little more slop in its execution?<br />
<br />
If you agree with any of these issues other than the first one though, I have to ask why it's such a big deal. That falls more into quality of life issues. What I keep reading in this forum (though remarkably not so much on other WoW-dedicated forums) is that warriors and DKs have a higher failure rate on &quot;bosses that matter&quot; to the extent that they are being replaced by paladins and perhaps druids. We don't have a lot of evidence either of those things are happening though, which is why I have spent so much effort trying to understand where some of you are coming from.

Death Knight and tanking<br />
<br />
We think it's still a good goal to have DKs who are tanking use different abilities than DKs who are doing dps. I don't thing tying Blood Tap to Vampiric Blood et al. the way it has been has worked out well however. That wasn't really where we were going with it.<br />
<br />
I'm arm-waving here, but imagine a world where (say it in movie preview announcer voice):<br />
<br />
-- Blood Tap finishes the cooldown of all your runes. It's on a 15 sec cooldown.<br />
-- You can use Blood Tap for an emergency Death and Decay.<br />
-- Neither of these are things you do rotationally, the way you hit Plague Strike, Icy Tough and Blood Strike though. You use them for emergencies.<br />
-- These emergencies aren't super common because there aren't encounters where large groups of mobs regularly stream in that will one-shot the healers if they aren't tanked. If it's a large pull, sure AE tank that, but the individual mobs will die quickly. On large pulls with serious mobs, you CC the dangerous casters, kill a couple of others as quickly as you can, and have the tanks pull out a couple of the mobs, essentially tying them up too.<br />
-- Likewise, Consecrate (especially Consecrate) gets somehow changed to a similar mechanic. Now nobody is just spamming AE threat moves to keep stuff stuck to them.<br />
-- Imagine a Hyjal raid where the dangerous adds have to be tanked or CC'd, and then the weaker minions are just blown up with AE. These weaker guys don't have to be tanked because they won't one-shot a dps player (though you may have to Frost Nova once in awhile or whatever). <br />
<br />
How would you enforce this on dps? I'm curious. <br />
Make Death and Decay cause almost no damage but very high threat, and let dps DKs use Blood Boil or something. I'm not saying that's the best solution, but it isn't an unsolvable problem. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure where you're going GC... I've read the thread and imagined all this, and it sounds cool but... what do you mean? Are you saying that this sort of mechanic is the direction you'd like to head in the future or what?<br />
Yes. I was answering Devium's question in a round about way. We could make DnD take one rune, or give it a short cooldown and make it free. It would make it easier for DKs to AE tank, but I'm not sure it's a good direction for the game ultimately. (Though if DKs have horrible problems AE tanking in Icecrown, we'd fix it anyway.)<br />

What would happen if Assassination was overpowered in 3.3?<br />
Yes, there would be a change. The goal is not to get every rogue to go Assassination. The goal is to give you options. If Combat totally out-performed Assassination even on a target as simple as a static dummy then we can't see why anyone would try Assassination. I know some of you are concerned that the Mutilate buff was too high. We'll have some better real-world (not that it is a &quot;real world&quot;) soon (tm).

Tanking as a warrior<br />
The red flag part is all I've ever really been talking about. We can't find any evidence that warriors are failing on encounters, and not many players have been able to provide much yet. Most of what is being brought up is that &quot;When I estimate EH, my number looks lower than his number.&quot; That is very much an issue IF it actually means something in the game. I'm looking for some explanation of what actually happens on a boss. Some players post that they've personally experienced a discrepancy and I have no reason to think they're lying or anything. But if it's a trend, it's one that's pretty hard for us to detect. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21560336259-who-else-is-tired-of-the--warrior-mt-line.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I wonder what the new gift will be then ^,^<br />
<br />
I suppose crashin &amp; trashin will become a feat of strength, or be removed entirely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Will we be seeing any sort of pet drop/thrasher/toy type thing, or is the BB gun the replacement for this year?<br />

Well it's something like that.<br />

I'd say the Shoveltusk are are in a shamanistic way a reprensentation of a resilient, strong and successfull breed of animals in Northrend who's spirits lend their strength to you.<br />

Granted, WotLK introduced a load of great new philosophies such as raid wide buffs, every spec being viable abnd multiple tank classes. However I just feel like Blizz never anticipated how much more powerful players have become due to all this extra stacking buffs and have been playing catchup ever since. Also the whole &quot;AoE pulling&quot; of everything has really dumbed down the game, given the players LESS interesting decision not more and really increased the amount of boredom.

No, really. Sorry for trolling.<br />
Shoveltusks are inhabitants of Nordend, it's somewhat their home. They reflect the ghost of the northern wilderness.<br />

Actually, shamans are connected with the Spirit World. And in shamanism, a deer is a &quot;power animal&quot;. Just google it, you will find out, what the hell that means.<br />

The red flag part is all I've ever really been talking about. We can't find any evidence that warriors are failing on encounters, and not many players have been able to provide much yet. Most of what is being brought up is that &quot;When I estimate EH, my number looks lower than his number.&quot; That is very much an issue IF it actually means something in the game. I'm looking for some explanation of what actually happens on a boss. Some players post that they've personally experienced a discrepancy and I have no reason to think they're lying or anything. But if it's a trend, it's one that's pretty hard for us to detect. <br />
<br />

Yes all the guilds that are doing world and realm firsts are noobs and your GL/RL is/ are the smart ones here. /sarcams<br />
Honestly Warriors are not bad off, a bit lower in the HP pool but they still generate great threat and if PLAYED right still a great tank in any situation. Really player skill comes into play. I too think CG is a moron with most of his statements, but if you have tanked w/an equally geared skilled warrior you will see that they are a viable tank. PERIOND.<br />
In fact for some encounters they are still a better tank, warrior want to complain about what they don[t have and take pride in the fact you stilll mitigate majical damage better, have a charge and aoe stuns. Stop the QQ please warriors, it could be worse you could have been done to what DK's had done them.</div></div><hr />

What would happen if Assassination was overpowered in 3.3?<br />
Yes, there would be a change. The goal is not to get every rogue to go Assassination. The goal is to give you options. If Combat totally out-performed Assassination even on a target as simple as a static dummy then we can't see why anyone would try Assassination. I know some of you are concerned that the Mutilate buff was too high. We'll have some better real-world (not that it is a &quot;real world&quot;) soon (tm).

<br />
See what I did there? If your raid or guild leaders are replacing you for someone else, that means either A) you suck, or B) they're morons. Or both, in your case. You are arguing with memes instead of actual evidence. The evidence demonstrates that warriors have zero problems tanking every encounter in the game, and in fact, tank the hardest content in greater numbers than any other class of tank. How do you rectify that with your &quot;warrior tanks are getting REPLACED ;_;&quot; assertion? Do you just handwave the numbers away? How do you cope with your perceptions being so far from reality?</div></div><hr />

However Paladins do seem to have an edge on their counterparts. I'm not a huge tank buff, but just my anecdotal evidence tells me Paladins are ever so slightly tougher.<br />
<br />
The other point of course is that Paladins have Argent Defender - a passive guardian spirit effect for the rare occasion that a killing blow is delivered. This by itself gives them a huge advantage over warriors. Where warriors would die and cause an unfortunate wipe, Paladins are saved by argent defender and healers take a slap on the wrist for letting it happen. That seems very unfair to me.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind retcons as long as they aren't stupid, Orcs don't have spaceships, Draenei isn't a real shaman race because perhaps I was a bit unclear in my post, 'original' would have been a better word, because I meant one of the playable races that have been able to be shamans since wc3/classic WoW and where in my post do I claim that I am a Horde fanboy and I hate Gnomes?

GC's comments about tank disparities seem a little odd. He says it's not a big deal if one class has to work harder + have healers work harder to achieve the same thing as another class that's not an issue? Can't see how that makes sense, surely that's an imbalance in itself if one class requires significantly more skill on the part of not only the player but the rest of their group in order to clear the same content.<br />
<br />
I mean maybe boss-by-boss one class can be better than the other but if this is a general trend surely it's still a problem?<br />

I think the arguement about Dreanei is long and old and very dead. <br />
<br />
Since we have never had a cinematic or video of how the Exodar travelled to Azeroth from Outland (I thought it was more of a phasing thing) its left up to the imagination. If you want to believe that it was like a flying saucer UFO with flashing lights and a big beam to desposit these new aliens on Azeroth then be my guest, but I seriously doubt thats how it actually happened :P<br />

No they aren't. Draenei come from Argus and Orcs from Draenor (which has been named that for a while which was okay since the original Draenei, which are now 'the Broken' was native to that planet, but now with the retcon the Aliens named to world they came to, with the explanation that the Orcs just called it &quot;the world&quot; before that) but yeah, Orcs are aliens to Azeroth too, but they came through a magic portal (fantasy) while Draenei came with a spaceship (science-fiction).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing really wrong with growing a fantasy universe that spans multiple worlds out to the point where some race may have some space travel.<br />
<br />
And no where did it say the Broken were specifically native to that world in WC3, they just did notsay anything one way or the other and you are left to assume.<br />
<br />
Fantasy and science fiction do not have to be mutually exclusive..<br />
<br />

Also, the Dreanai is nothing close to a demon race. A large portion of them have turned demonic yes, but so did blood elves [fel elves]<br />

Yeah, we first thought they were demons but the lore changed, and thats what happens to a dynamic game like WoW.<br />

I love it and when people tell me i'm op i just laugh. i havent been playing a warrior that long either. and becuase of the fact these &quot;good&quot; tankking classes think warriors are op. when were not.and on my server the majority of tanks on it are paladins and deathknights. every druid on the server is either a moonkin or a tree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been known for months. This year's unique gift will be the BB Gun. There's been an achievement to pelt the leaders of the opposite faction with it for quite a while now. As soon as BB King got added it was blatantly obvious to anyone that's been playing WoW for at least 2 years to have seen the Vintage gifts that this year's would be a BB gun.<br />
<br />
There's been a unique gift every year for a while--remember the Clockwork Rocket Bot in 2007? The racer came out of the unique gift box from the tree (the same box the rocket bot was in the year before). There's even a feat of strength for looting &quot;the 2008 Vintage Winter Veil gift, the Crashin' Thrashin' Racer&quot;. Why is the fact we won't get another racer in 2009 news to people?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Orcs are aliens to Azeroth too, but they came through a magic portal (fantasy) while Draenei came with a spaceship (science-fiction).<br />
<br />
<br />
So Stargate is Fantasy, not Sci-Fi, by your logic?<br />
<br />
And before you say &quot;but it's a MAGICAL portal, not a technological one&quot;, who's to say the Exodar didn't use magical engines instead of technological ones? It's a really thin argument. There's also been a mixing of fantasy and science fiction for many, many years across many, many franchises. Why does this one in particular bother you so much?</div></div><hr />

I play a DK OT and we usually have a Pally MT, and neither of us usually have problems with deaths (until a healer dies or too many dps are down).<br />
<br />
It could be that warriors are harder to tank with, or harder to heal, or just bad luck. Honestly, playing a DK tank isn't fun and games either. We don't have a pally bop or a druid's health, we have cooldowns that need to be timed perfectly. We have to spam rune strike, keep DnD up, keep diseases up... it's like playing a DPS and a tank at the same time.<br />
<br />
Not to mention we incapable of tanking adds on Anub, without a block rating. We either MT or DPS, but as a MT we're still taking some huge hits. If your guild has two DKs for main tanks, you won't be finishing Grand Crusader anytime soon, and it's unfortunate the game's mechanics locks us out like that.<br />
<br />
BUT I did get Tribute to Insanity (10) a couple days ago, MTing with our Pally on OT, so we're definitely not worthless.<br />
<br />

Btw, thx Boub :-*<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed, they should really make them slowly erupt from the shoulders like the quoted poster said, that would require some work though, not much, but work nonetheless. But they could atleast make them fade in, instead of suddently appearing like they do now, it just doesnt look right...</div></div><hr />

No where in the tooltip of those sets does it mention the animation proc. However, the shaman set does, suggesting the proc may be a tad bit different.<br />

Why shaman? Why do shamans only get the animation?<br />
Not to mention..the proc? They get a buff from it. How is that not OP from other classes who don't get it? It's not like shamans need any fucking help. Some of the best healers, amazing DPS at high end content behind a skilled player, and completely wreck in pvp.<br />
not really getting it.</div></div><hr />

Funny how everyone thinks its a buff of some sort, when I read it I read it as something like them coming and going &quot;Your doing great! Keep it going&quot; not an actual in-game buff.</div></div><hr />

If you have payed any attention over the years, you would have noticed that warlocks got the wing animation on the teir 6 and rogues got an animation on the teir 8 so chances are every other class will evntually get one. And there is nothing stateing that the shaman shoulders give a buff.</div></div><hr />

It's quite funny indeed that some people find draenei hard to accept due to it being &quot;sci-fi&quot;, and yet NO ONE has brought up Netherstorm! 4 Floating spaceships, lots of technical things (mana forges) and eco-domes? That's more sci-fi than Draeneis are for crying out loud! And that came out at the same time as Draeneis did!</div></div><hr />

i lol´d. <br />
<br />
there was a time in wotlk, where resto sucked compared to other healers<br />
there was a time in wotlk, where ele sucked dps-wise<br />
and while enh is doing pretty good overall atm, the other melee dps hybrids ( ferals, warriors, dk´s and retardins ) not to mention the *pure* dps classes have overall better dmg potential.<br />
<br />
other than that:<br />
<br />
glyphe of the moose<br />
<br />
minor<br />
<br />
enlarges your t10 effect 5fold and it´s duration is permanent<br />

I certanly hope not, i personally hate it. It used to be fun in BC having to gear up in older raids and then move up to the new ones. Sure it was difficult at the time to find groups, but this new party system should fix that right up?</div></div><hr />
