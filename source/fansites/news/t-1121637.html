Good god, this a million times this lol. Waiting inline to do a bugging quest was super annoying and time consuming. I would rather them polish stuff then add more stuff. If they dump a lot more the beta forum is just going to be totally over run with threads and lots of good bugs will be missed with crowded. &quot;Dude that armor is lame&quot; or &quot;how do I use the portal&quot; and a really sad &quot;Where is reagent vendor&quot;</div></div><hr />

I would guess that the armor isn't available to use, so this might just be the initial add it into the game files. I couldn't see them making the weapons have this big of discrepancy. I think Hunters are going to be super mean in PvP, their self heal is pretty boss atm and their damage output in the PvE stuff I've done has been pretty darn nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, this has already been announced by Blizz at the press tour in March. PvP gear will be just as good as PvE gear for PvE (if of the same item level). PvE gear on the other hand, will not be as competitive as PvP gear for PvP (if same item level). This is due to how resilience is given for free instead of being taken from the item budget as it used to.<br />
<br />
Hopefully PvP gear will have lower item levels than PvE gear though, otherwise everyone is going to be forced to do Arena again if they want to do PvE, just as the horrible situation back in TBC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Relax, this stuff happens sometimes. An, no with a bug that is crashing the majority of beta testers we won't see it fixed in weeks... that would delay proper testing. If they (Blizzard) can locate and fix the bug quickly we likely we have a small fix come out for it within the next 24 hours. Though, this isn't gaurenteed, but generally speaking that will be the case. Until then, the only advice folks have is lower your settings, and avoid heavyly populated areas. It's not a foulproof fix, but it helps a little.</div></div><hr />

And how long did they take to fix the last one which was doing exactly the same ?<br />
So basically we should avoid testing the new content that a large part of the beta is actually about.<br />

The basic structure is obviously based on the cliche black mage garb.<br />
The set makes use of the Third Eye of Dalaran, which apparently heightens insight and focus. Note that the three main eyes on the set are coloured after the three schools of magic that mages use.<br />
The actual glowing eyes of different colours has ties to real-world myths stating that it shows a person has innate power.<br />
