11:30PM PST - Ysera (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/august/ysera.jpg) looks great.<br />
11:00PM PST - Added 6 screenshots of the game data streaming and added reforging. Classes changes are on the way. (Yes, &quot;a few hours&quot; doesn't mean the eternity) <br />

<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Beta - Build 12694<br />
A new build is being deployed on live servers. The coverage of the changes in this patch will take a while because .... well, we have to redownload the whole client with a downloader currently in beta. (Beta is the keyword here, really) <br />
<br />
<br />
Reforging<br />
Reforging is finally here! You can swap 40% of any of the secondary stats of an item (mostly ratings) for another secondary stat. <br />

<br />
When you have enough data to enter the game, the world will be downloaded as you progress through the game. Absolutely everything is streamed, the world, the maps, special parts of the interface, etc ... It's a little annoying when you start from scratch but it's fairly impressive. <br />

<br />
IMPORTANT!!! - Spell tooltips aren't accurate for the moment, we're working on a fix. Stick to the values written in this post. <br />

Cataclysm Build 12694 Official Notes<br />
I'm pretty sure I never posted the official patch notes on the front page, they're not really interesting but at least you have something to read while you download the client.<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Beta Patch Notes (version 12694)<br />
<br />
Welcome to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta test! Patch notes listed here are not comprehensive and will be changed throughout the testing process.<br />
<br />
General<br />
The Alliance starting experience for worgen is available. Venture through the cursed lands of Gilneas to discover your true path! Currently the female worgen character is not available for testing.<br />
The Horde starting experience for goblins is available. Beginning on the Isle of Kezan in a goblin paradise, players will face a treacherous road ahead!<br />
The level cap for all characters is 83.<br />
Elements of the guild leveling, perks, and roster page are now functional. Players should once again be able to buy and register guild charters, which now only require five signatures. See the Known Issues section for issues associated with this new system.<br />
Cataclysm Launcher Update<br />
<br />
The new Cataclysm Launcher allows you to stream game data while you play. This will reduce the time you spend downloading, installing, and patching World of Warcraft. We&#8217;d like to get your feedback on the toolset and gameplay experience. Please head to the forums here for additional information: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26262801168&amp;sid=2000<br />
<br />
Players may use our Character Copy feature for copying existing characters to beta realms, or may choose from high-level pre-made template characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zones<br />
Mount Hyjal and Vashj'ir, two new level 80-82 zones, are available for testing. Deepholm, a new level 82-83 zone is available for testing. Players may find their way to these zones by speaking with temporary teleportation NPCs located in any major city.<br />
The level ranges of Gilneas and the Lost Isles are in the process of being adjusted slightly. Creature, quest, and quest reward levels are all being altered so that players finish questing in these zones roughly by level 12. Further fine tuning will continue in future content updates.<br />
Several zones have had quest maps integrated.<br />
Eastern Kingdoms<br />
<br />
Arathi Highlands, Blasted Lands, The Cape of Stranglethorn, Dun Morogh, Duskwood, Eastern Plaguelands, Elwynn Forest, Hinterlands, Loch Modan, Northern Stranglethorn, Northshire, Redridge Mountains, Silverpine Forest, Tirisfal Glades, Western Plaguelands and Westfall are ready for testing.<br />
<br />
Kalimdor<br />
<br />
Most zones in Kalimdor are available for testing, though work continues on polishing the quest experience and flow, as well as zone aesthetics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Blackrock Caverns, a new level 80-81 five-player dungeon, is available for testing.<br />
The Stonecore, a new level 82-84 five-player dungeon, is available for testing.<br />
Throne of the Tides, a new level 80-81 five-player dungeon, is available for testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
All hunter and warlock pets have been deleted to address a data corruption issue. Hunters will need to tame new pets, while warlocks will notice the names of their pets have changed.<br />
Ammo has been removed from the game.<br />
The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities have changed.<br />
The glyph system is in the process of being altered. Existing glyphs may not be fully supported or functional.<br />
Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.<br />
Rage has been normalized.<br />
Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale with character level.<br />
A first pass on new talent trees has been implemented.<br />
Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.<br />
Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.<br />
31 points must be spent in the primary specialization tree before any points can be placed in additional trees.<br />
Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing so will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.<br />
More information regarding our plans for talent trees can be found here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/4p0/classandmastery.xml<br />

A new Eclipse mechanic has been added for druids. The feature is functional, but the interface art is still a work in-progress.<br />
<br />

Five pets can now be stored with the hunter at all times. Any one of these five pets can be summoned via the Call Pet ability.<br />
Focus has replaced mana as a new resource.<br />
Hunters now start with a pet at level 1.<br />
The Stable will now store 20 pets. If a pet is moved into the Stable, its talents are wiped.<br />

Soul Shards have been removed from the game as items. Instead, they now exist as a resource system necessary for using, or altering the mechanics of certain spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
The Reforging interface has been implemented, however it may not currently be hooked up correctly to the corresponding NPCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
The ability to use third-party addons has been temporarily disabled for the test environment.<br />
The Arena Teams pane has been improved.<br />
Auto-quests have been added to the game. Players will automatically be given an auto-quest by entering specific areas in the game world. This alert will appear distinctly in the Objectives pane via the Advanced Quest Tracking feature. These quests will still be given to players with full Quest Logs, but will count toward the 25 total allotted quests if the log is not full.<br />
The Character pane has been redesigned. Character stats can now be shown or hidden via the Show All Details/Hide All Details button on the bottom left. When shown, all character stats will be visible in a window to the right of the pane. Stat sections can be reorganized by clicking and dragging them up or down the pane.<br />
The Professions panes now have more filtering and search functionality, as well as buttons to easily link recipes in the chat frame.<br />
Many of the yellow System Messages that would display in the chat frame when leveling up have been removed.<br />
New text animations now alert players as they level up, also providing information on when new talents, spells and abilities are available.<br />
Professions and Class Trainers windows have been altered to more clearly display available and upcoming purchases.<br />
Raid frames are now available and have temporarily replaced the standard party frames so that players can test them.<br />
The Spellbook interface has been improved for greater ease-of-use and visual appeal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Graphics<br />
Experimental support for DX11 (can be enabled by passing &#8216;-d3d11&#8217; on the command line or adding SET gxApi &quot;d3d11&quot; to the Config.WTF file).<br />
OpenGL Hardware Cursor support (can be enabled on the Video Resolution Panel).<br />
Improved water and lava rendering system (enabled by the Liquid Detail slider on the Video Effects Panel)<br />
0 = Classic Water<br />
1 = New Water (fake reflections)<br />
2 = New Water (ocean has real reflection for terrain)<br />
These values are likely to change during Beta.<br />
<br />
Dynamic Sunshafts effect (enabled by the Sunshafts option on the Video Effects Panel).<br />
<br />
<br />
Known Issues<br />
Sudden Death procs do not reset the cooldown of Colossus Smash.<br />
Several cloaks are displayed incorrectly on draenei females.<br />
Ground mounts can be used when underwater in Vashj'ir.<br />
Corpses are not tapped on the quest &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; allowing other players to use the Sovereign Rod on targets they did not kill.<br />
While on the quest &quot;Blood and Thunder!&quot; NPCs will despawn prior to the event and the quest cannot be completed.<br />
Sound is cutting in and out during two segments of Mor'norokk's voiceover during the quest, &quot;Some Spraining to Do&quot;.<br />
Characters with two professions learned cannot train new spells.<br />
The spell effect visuals for Healing Rain and Earthquake look awkward when cast on a staircase or a steep incline.<br />
Guild control and guild banks are experiencing issues related to the new guild leveling interface and functionality. In addition, guild experience may not display properly when players change zones, and guild members will be demoted to the lowest guild rank when logging out.<br />
Battleground queues are undergoing significant changes and are not currently operational.<br />
Gnome and troll characters have a broken background displayed as well as a LUA error at the character selection and creation screens. Having either a gnome or troll character can cause newly created characters to not display on the character list until it is refreshed by logging out and back in, switching realms and then switch back, or logging into and back out of the realm.<br />
Players are currently unable to create new worgen characters.<br />
Selecting high Liquid Detail when using Geforce 6 &amp; 7 series video cards will currently prevent lava and water from rendering properly. You can temporarily restore liquid to the world by reducing the Liquid Detail setting via the Video Effects Panel, or by typing &#8220;waterDetail 0&#8221; in your Config.WTF file.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
Entering a phase with phased terrain (i.e. Rim of the World) no longer boots players from flying mounts.<br />
Players are now able to receive Stoneskin Totem from shaman trainers.<br />
The quest &quot;Up the Volcano&quot; can now be completed.<br />
Characters now ride the Swift Seahorse for the quest &quot;Waking the Beast.&quot;<br />
The mob Tendril from Below should no longer fall below the world when killed.<br />
Globe of Boiling Water should now drop from Scalding Water Lords for the quest &quot;Full of Hot Water.&quot;<br />
The quest &quot;Blackfin's Booty&quot; can be completed.<br />
The quest &quot;Offering to Azshara&quot; can be completed.<br />
The quest &quot;Seeds of Discord&quot; should reset properly.<br />
The rug in Stormglen Inn is should no longer be experiencing z-fighting with the floor beneath it.<br />
The fire damage from lava should no longer hit players at any height.<br />
Trainers are functioning properly.<br />
Selecting a character on the character select screen after creating a new one will no longer cause the game to display and act on the character two slots above the selected one.</div></div><hr />

Yes, could you expand on why it makes you sad? Is there some inherent failure in the design/implementation, or is it just DLing everything again? :)<br />

16gb is most likely at least a 3-day project for me, my brother is constantly using half of the bandwidth and got to leave some for other stuff as well, so I'll have to cap it at 80kb/sec..sigh. 2mb connection for 4 PCs in one household is no fun.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people with slower internet connections or new players don't want to wait 3 hours for a game they just got, they wanna get in and play within minutes.<br />
<br />
Also iirc this feature will be optional when it goes live, don't like it? Don't use it.</div></div><hr />

Yup. It really is impossible to use the old patches. I saved them hoping to use them, but the launcher downloads everything - all 13+ gig. Might as well delete them now.</div></div><hr />

The streaming is only for use if you want to log in before you've finished patching - and its optional.<br />
There are internet speed requirements to run the streaming.<br />
<br />
They'd never make someone use streaming just to prevent data mining - they'd kill off a portion of their userbase who are on cheaper ISPs.</div></div><hr />

Gaiwyn: The new stat doesn't stay green. You can restore a reforged item later. Also, if you link the reforged item to someone, it doesn't show the reforged stats - it only shows the original item's stats.</div></div><hr />

Not really. Imagine if it downloaded the Lich King encounter encrypted in the ICC patch, and only after someone cleared to Lich King on your realm did the server offer clients the decryption key. To the player, they'd not notice anything as the decryption would happen in a couple seconds and they'd not need to relog or anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q. Will I still be able to download patches from mirror sites?<br />
A. Yes, standalone patches will still work.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing dont run the new launcher until you install all the patches.</div></div><hr />

Don't fucking mention this stuff all the time if you don't wanna stick to it.<br />
<br />
Also, yeah, while the Night Elf look, the horns etc. is well done kinda sucks that they simply rehashed Sylvannas/Alexstrasza's model and added the Druid T8 shoulders.... doesn't as major a character as Ysera deserve something more? FFS Garrosh got his own unique model.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you only have to stream it once. It's just a way to let people play while things are downloading/patching.<br />

Her arms are waaaaay too thin. They need to be bulked up more. Her gauntlets look like they are placed on toothpicks and threatening to fall off. Her eyes need to stay closed and be obvious that they are. No glowies showing. She also needs to not use the Belf animations. I'd say use Nelf, but FFS, she'd look retarded bouncing like a cheerleader. Choose human or worgen female standing animations for her. She needs to be more dignified.<br />

Lol, my initial reaction towards shadow changes was the complete opposite. I'm drooling all over them :P Especially sin and punishment and the synergy with Dark Evangelism/Archangel. I think the tree is much more interesting all of a sudden. Hate to not see holy changes though.</div></div><hr />

Still no DK love though. I hope hope hope something BIG is coming for DK that will be worth the wait. Seems all I ever see updates for are Pally, Mage and Warr.<br />
<br />
I like the Feral changes, Bear Swipe on 6 sec cd most likely means it will do a lot more threat, and i always hated trying to spam it to keep aoe packs on me in early Wotlk. I didnt like Bears in Wotlk, so went DK to tank and loved it. Bears getting a lot more love though than Blood DK so far.</div></div><hr />

Shadowform is actually gaining a bonus. Improved SF is losing one. The 5 second channel isn't necessarily a bad thing...in fact, what are you expecting they did to it? It's a channeled spell, it's still doing damage at the same rate, and casting it doesn't cause anything, the ticks do. Unless, they nerfed the damage, it shouldn't be an issue.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty fucked up. Let's assume an ICC protpally with fully buffed 6k AP which would result in 3200 + (3x6000) = 21200 holydamage? ...+30% more holy damage with inquisition and that's without vengeance, which would buff the paladin to around 10k-12k AP. So 35k-40k holydamage and that's not even a critical hit. °_°</div></div><hr />

Then they make heroic strike not proc bloodsurge, making BT the only reliable bloodsurge proccer. So, while not enraged, our rotation is just heroic strike and blood thirst?

Ysera is hot, but then again it's just a recolour of Alex/Sylv and those two are both fine ;)<br />
Dark Evangelism is pure win:P now lets just hope that the graphic the put in is awesome(and preferably different for ESmite and EShadow) <br />
Loving the return of ShoR and it's interaction with HS, I'm glad they went for the refresh route, instead of the Apply route, as that way we would have just been replacing 3xhp&gt;HS for 3xhp&gt;ShoR spaming :P wtb the return of the damage on HS though ;)<br />
plus I'm really hoping ShoR is 3198 damage like it says in the blue text, not 390 like the tooltip :P I know it says not to trust the Tooltips, but somehow I can't see Blizz giving us an ability that hits for 3198 base PER stack of Holy power... 9594 damage fully stacked, plus AP :P love it.<br />
plus im guessing that 398% damage on HoTR is a bug as well, seems a fairly wierd number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, it would be nice if Blizzard would rename Evangelism since its an affront to my religious views.<br />

Booh, freaking hoo! At least they aren't forcing you to try to find something to do in WotLK (which thanks to Cata Beta and SCII looks like a ghost land). I feel no sympathy for you.

The streaming trial client also doesn't download content, unpack it, and install it while you're playing however. The streaming trial just streams, and doesn't save any of the info.<br />
<br />
To those requesting the installer: Blizzard changed their download system. Once you download the initial installer, its tied to your IP address, and expires within a few hours.

They might use it in the future to prevent datamining bosses before anyone's reached them.<br />

That would be a stupid decision. One of the only things that gets me pumped for raiding is doing the gear. If they prevent data mining then you won't see that gear until it actually drops. It would be the biggest mistake Blizzard has ever actually made. I'd be more pissed about that then Real ID.<br />

... I really hope they don't screw up their own fucking lore by having Ysera's eyes open all the time. They mentioned time and time and time again in the official lore/novels that Ysera always has her eyes closed and only opens them on very, very, very rare occasions.<br />
Don't fucking mention this stuff all the time if you don't wanna stick to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
On that day when fire reigned from the heavens and the earth was shook violently asunder, on that very day Ysera decided she was tired of keeping her eyes closed and opened them to see the destruction being done to the land of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
There you go, lore explained. Since that is normally what Blizzard does, there is no use getting into the lore. Its not like its DAoC where the lore has been written for hundreds of years. They make this crap up as they go along.</div></div><hr />

- No SF bonus<br />
- Shadow Power gone (?!?!)<br />
<br />
What are they on at the Blizzard's HQ?<br />
<br />
Are you honestly bitching about a talent that required you to ramp up to your max damage by casting 5 spells before you were there? Are you honestly bitching because our filler will be cast over a longer period of time (before haste) meaning that it can have a higher spell power coefficient with the way the game is designed? Shadow Power isn't gone per say, it will be rolled into the mastery system just like EVERY OTHER class that has had crit/haste removed from their trees has had done. Yes, lets have them undo everything they just did, while they are at it they can add more talents to the shadow tree, more talents I say. I want to spend all 41 points in the tree and still not get the best talents.<br />

Added a PvP talent on 6th tier yeah great for raiding.<br />
Only Dark Evangelism seems cool but i doubt it's that cool to balance the DPS loss from shadow power/SF buffs.<br />
<br />
You can easily put 31 points in the tree and get every talent you would actually want for PvE. That allows them to put in the Evangelism/Archangel synergy.<br />

seems like aoe tanking got the nerfhammer :o druids are struggling with aggro as it is, but 6 sec cd on swipe? doubt any druid will hold aoe aggro now. and pala's consecration with a 30 sec cd? pull a group, kill em within 15 seconds. afk for 15 seconds until its refreshed and pull another pack. makes no sense. unless theres talents/glyphs that reduce those silly cooldowns, or some new aoe attacks.<br />
<br />
and why warriors didnt get some aoe nerf? oh right, because they QQ all the time :P at least a short while ago every news post contained warrior tears<br />
<br />
Druids got a new ability to use in that rotation. <br />
<br />
The new rotation will be something like:<br />
<br />
New Ability (I forget the name of)<br />
Demoralizing Roar<br />
Swipe<br />
<br />
Now, instead of spamming one ability to keep aoe threat we will be spamming 3 as soon as they are off cool down.<br />
<br />
Oh, and druids aren't &quot;struggling for aggro.&quot; They actually put out amazing aggro. The only reason people think that they are struggling for aggro is that most people overlook agility just to stack the hell out of stamina (which isn't the best way to gear a druid tank by any means) and most groups don't want to wait for the druid to actually get rage before they start going balls to the wall on dps. The only thing really hurting druid tanks right now is rage management since we get no real way to maintain our rage other than a cool down.</div></div><hr />

First, seeing 6s cd on bear swipe made me really smile. Looks like Blizz was unable to solve the &quot;streaming adds&quot; issue by other way and therefor nerfing every aoe tanking. What a downfall, but on the other hand, less spamming one ability ? (btw, no cd on that aoe &quot;shoutlike&quot; debuff ? so instead of swiping i will be demo roaring ... that isnt cool at all )<br />
<br />
Second, priest changes. Good news for shadow priests in disc tree, you can now choose better and more fitting talents for you, as GC promised (cd on PW:S and Dark evangelism yay). On the other hand i still lack info why only smite is the one boosting it, why not penance also ? You want it healing only ? Or it would be a trap that healer could not recover from ? Sound like good place to take a choice if there was smite AND penance.<br />
Also i like changes to shadowpriests. Never to dispel near someone from now on ya !</div></div><hr />

All Cata items were slightly more than vendor, while all the ICC gear I tried to reforge was vendor prices.<br />
<br />
Its been stated that its supposed to be the vendor price, so if the Cata items were more than vendor price then its a bug that will eventually get worked out. Perhaps the vendor price on the Cataclysm items is off and they will be increased in value at at later point. Since the repair cost is based on the vendor cost, it would make sense to actually drop the vendor price of the item for the beta to alleviate some of the repair cost pain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DAoC never had reforging. They had an ability to salvage items (see Disenchant) and then an ability to craft items with whatever stats you wanted using the materials you salvaged. However, you didn't really need to use salvaged items to craft, so it was hardly reforging. If what you are pushing for is a system where you can chose what stats you want on your gear while you craft it then Blizzard hasn't really come remotely close to spellcrafting, and I'm not sure any game ever really has. Spellcrafting was quite possibly the most awesome system ever put into a game.</div></div><hr />

What do you want? It's a beta, they aren't going to fill the beta with all the cool things like cinematics and cool things till release, yes they've been working on it since before LK, but that could be said about every expansion to the last raid boss.

The only thing I can think of this debacle is that the beta will not run nearly as long as past. There's no way feasible for them to think, &quot;they'll all pay for many more months of new content&quot;, until Cata release. I know many who froze their accounts now, mine is getting froze as of this weekend when times up. They're not getting my money if they're incapable of keeping content going at a reasonable pace. Their company is massive, they have tons of financial backing, there's really no excuse for this. Their &quot;when it's ready&quot; slogan is empty in meaning as well, as we know how many bugs and problems arise when each of their games launch anyways. Look at recently with SC2 frying people's GPU's due to poor programming, something they blamed nVidia for, then the ATI cards started baking. <br />
<br />
They are a poorly managed company, whose quality, and game's value has been in free-fall since the merger with Activision, and Blizzard got money hungry. They're one of the few company's out there to put on a &quot;show for the fans&quot; in which they charge their fans for enough money to pay for the event plus turn a healthy profit on.<br />
<br />
I used to really love Blizzard. Unfortunately with their piss-poor management there (major content lulls), and with the amount of recycled content/assets, and Pay-For mounts/pets/additional services, they're not the Blizzard of old and it feels like they're just gouging us now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, yeah. She really should have her eyes closed. <br />
<br />
But yeah, Cataclysm really needs to be out before Christmas if they want to keep the playerbase they have now. If we're stuck with ICC for a full year of little extras in content (Ruby Sanctum is hardly a time filler). And even then, the Cataclysm events of Gnomeregan and Echo Isles, people will finish them within a day. So again, hardly a time filler. <br />
<br />
I really am hoping to find Cataclysm release date soon, because the longer I have to wait without playing a Worgen, and in the new Azeroth, the more annoyed I feel towards the current game. I just have my friends on my RP server to keep me going mostly.</div></div><hr />

Don't fucking mention this stuff all the time if you don't wanna stick to it.<br />

Also, yeah, while the Night Elf look, the horns etc. is well done kinda sucks that they simply rehashed Sylvannas/Alexstrasza's model and added the Druid T8 shoulders.... doesn't as major a character as Ysera deserve something more? FFS Garrosh got his own unique model.<br />

I hate to say it, but you agreed to be a beta tester. No one promised it would be all getting to see the Worgen and Goblin start areas and play the new dungeons before everyone else. This is what they need tested right now. The advantages to being a tester are many, but you have to remember that your primary purpose is to test the new features of the game and help Blizzard get them working. You're not really a customer right now, you're more of a volunteer employee. Blizzard is exchanging insider knowledge and first looks for your labor in getting the game ready for release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cata will be released in November whether its ready or not. All they will do, if they are behind schedule, is delay release of some of the promised content until patch 4.1 and 4.2.<br />
<br />
If you don't think they will then you are ignoring reality. They have already announced that Cata won't include a few of the things they had originally planned for release until a later content patch (there was a blue post and this doesn't include the things they promised at Blizzcon and cancelled outright) and both prior expansions have had similar content delays (one even had stuff delayed even though it was printed on the box).<br />
<br />
So you can all stop &quot;worrying&quot;. Cata will be released by November. It just won't have as much release content as you were promised or expected.</div></div><hr />

To much QQ about her model, big deal it resembles Alextrasza, they ARE Sisters. :/ I think her model looks nice, and far better in appearance than &quot;Garrosh&quot; His model looks retarded, like a gorilla/ogre hybrid instead of an orc.<br />
the thing about her eyes is that over and over again, no matter what her fight or her time speaking to anyone, her eyes remained closed. And not even when she is in her mortal form, her eyes are closed. and it has been known she only opens them in rare occasions and few have been able to look into them. Even with the cataclysm, the chance of her eyes staying open all the time still seems a little far fetched. I can see her opening here eyes metaphorically, but I don't see them physically being able to be opened in front of everyone.</div></div><hr />

You'd hate Ontario then. First time you go over the limit it's forgiven. If you continue to go over limits you pay through the nose. If you consistently go over limits, they will cut off your service.</div></div><hr />

The real choice now is between Archangel and Improved Inner Fire 3/3. Since Inner Fire is a spell damage buff it will all come down to how much spell damage Archangel grants compared to just Evangelism as compared to the increased spell damage of IIF 3/3. <br />
<br />
Also, it would be nice if Blizzard would rename Evangelism since its an affront to my religious views.<br />
<br />
Well I'm glad there is something constructive here but...<br />
<br />
Really dude, Really? Is using the name of your religious beliefs in and of it self bad? I mean that seems like a pretty sweet buff to me why would you take offense? Besides which 'evangelism' does not simply refer to a set of religious beliefs it is actually also synonymous with particular zeal (in the dictionary) and precedes the evangelical church as a term to refer to the extremely pious.</div></div><hr />

The huge glowing holes where her eyes should be probably suggest her eyes will in fact be closed.<br />
<br />
Actually this isn't correct. The eyes closed thing does not have to be a physical moving of the model's eyelids, it's a texturing thing. Go check out any dragon in Model Viewer. All the colors except for green have their eyes textured as open. The green dragon's eyes are simply a different texture, depicting them as closed. All they'd have to do with Ysera's model is instead of having the normal glowy-white Nelf eye texture in there, have the squinty eye texture similar to how they've depicted all of their green dragons. There, done.</div></div><hr />

Why should they make a new model every time? The aspects take humanoid forms, and Ysera's is that of a Night Elf. Why should they make a new model from scratch when they have Blood Elf/Night Elf models already in the game?<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's not like it's just a generic Blood Elf female with some generic armor on. It's a Blood Elf model with new textures and graphics. <br />

I was hoping for something ... a little less like a blood elf painted like a night elf and dressed like a tart. Sure, Alexstrasza's plate bikini was defended by her being the Aspect of Life, although I still don't see how that makes it okay but that's just me, but why in the hell does Ysera dress exactly like Alexstrasza? Just because they're sisters don't mean they share the same wardrobe. Christ my sister and I stopped being dressed alike by my mother when I was 6. It's also likely that they'll close her eyes, because even after all the bad shit that's happened before, Ysera's only ever opened her eyes once, and that was when Archimonde killed Malorne.<br />
<br />
I actually preferred the Night Elf in the Naxx robe to this one, but that's mostly because I detest the Prima Donna hip-cocked way the female Blood Elf stands. For creatures as compassionate as Alexstrasza and Ysera, it throws off their character for them to look like they should be rolling their eyes and popping their chewing gum at me while they hand out their respective quests. Nit-picky, yes, but their motions and appearance should match their character. At least Harv ... I mean Malfurion won't be doing the male Blood Elf head shake of contempt and scorn at me.<br />

This is just sick the way they are destroying the game! With all the changes I will never want to play the new expansion. I think them forcing us to put 31 points in one tree before being able to use another one is the worst idea ever!!! What about people that like to hybrid spec? I hate the new talent point system and I am not happy with alot of the changes they are making to the classes. Also why cant a worgen be a pally? Humans can be pallys and worgens have a human form so they should be able to be pallys. With all the changes there making to pallys its sounds like a whole new class so I would be kinda interested in trying it out but not if I cant play it as a worgen. Blizzard is always trying to fix stuff that isnt broken.<br />
<br />
wait what? i thought u still can make hybrid spec.s you just won't get any of the Masteries if you do that.<br />
<br />
and wow, pointless qq much? you want to play a paly, but you can't play as a worgen? oh nooooo, damn that blizzard! what assholes! Freakin roll a human paly.</div></div><hr />

Blizzards beta process has little to no regard for your bandwidth limits, nor should it. Suck it up and be grateful you're even in the beta. It's not for you to preview the game early, it's for you to test the new things they are implementing, including delivery of the client.<br />
<br />
I'm so disgusted at how the quality of beta testers basically went to shit in the last 2 weeks. <br />

<br />
The only hybrid spec that is possible are 31/10 or 10/31<br />
<br />
You can't put 15 points into 1 tree, and 16 in another. Other trees don't unlock until you put 31 into a tree.</div></div><hr />

I fear you totally miss a point of new downloader, becouse its certainly not looks only what they are improving.<br />
