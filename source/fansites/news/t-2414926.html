Patch 8.0.1 - Leveling Speed<br />
Hey guys! We've been discussing the continued concerns about the speed of leveling since the pre-patch and we have a couple of updates to share with you.<br />
<br />
Since the pre-patch we've made a large number of hotfixes and changes to leveling content, and are continuing to find and fix bugs wherever possible. The intention was never to make leveling slower than it was in 7.3.5.<br />
<br />
If you're still finding it slower that it was a couple of weeks ago after those hotfixes, specifics about where you are, what you're fighting, and what spec you're playing would be extremely helpful for identifying any remaining issues.<br />
<br />
There is also a bit of weirdness at the moment with mob HP once you reach Legion content. Essentially due to de-powering the Artifact, we needed to make outdoor Legion mobs weaker than earlier content; otherwise, max level players would find themselves suddenly having a much harder time with outdoor world content such as World Quests. The development team realizes that this is resulting in a very jarring experience moving from Draenor to the Broken Isles, and plans to adjust Legion content to be more in-line with where it should be as leveling content in a future patch.<br />
<br />
Thank you guys for your continued feedback on this!<br />
<br />
Thanks for an actual response this time Ythisens. Unlike last time when you were discussing philosophy with the playerbase instead of acknowledging the elephant in the room.<br />
Yeah the confusing thing about that thread yesterday was that it was about philosophy of feedback, but once I stated it it was quickly bombarded (understandably) with things that are currently issues.<br />
<br />
The issue is that it STARTED getting slower in 7.3.5.. Going back to 7.3.5 leveling is better than what we have now sure, but it's not what we want.<br />
You're right the curve was adjusted to be smoother and a little bit slower in 7.3.5, so in comparison that would feel amazing, however that change was one that some players actually do enjoy. While its not what you want, some players did like that. I personally think it's slower and preferred it before the 7.3.5 patch(cause I'm the kind of player that wants to level really fast and just have more alts) but I understand why it was changed and recognize there are players that do like that change. I thought it felt equally jarring that someone could go from 1-100 in a matter of a few hours. The 7.3.5 patch felt like a solid middle ground between how it was in Classic/The Burning Crusade and to how it was pre 7.3.5 at least to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Leveling Speed Feedback<br />
The EU has a similar but somewhat different post on leveling speed. <br />
Just an update here, we've made a large number of hotfixes and changes to leveling the content since the Pre-Patch to address issues such as; adjusting mobs that were too hitting hard, some mob HP being disproportionately high, bosses having lethal abilities that weren't lethal before etc. both in, and out, of dungeons.<br />
<br />
If you notice that a particular mob takes a long time to kill, or has an ability that seems to hit a lot harder than before (this is for both open world, and within dungeons), please do continue to make bug reports about it. Being as specific as possible with the report, including information such as the name of the mob, what felt off, any high impact abilities, as well as what class and spec you're playing, will really help pin-point further pain-points so that we can fix them.<br />
<br />
Likewise if there are any dungeons you feel take too long or don't award EXP proportionate to the length, please do continue to submit these reports as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone who's taken the time to submit reports so far. We're continuing to squash bugs and make adjustments as the reports come in, the intention isn't for leveling to be slower than it was in 7.3.5<br />
<br />
Wow! thanks for an overdue post that doesnt actually address many of the issues. there is STILL no word about the dungeon completion bonuses. ive spent half my time attempting to level and the other half sending in bug reports. even gm's have brushed me off. just admit its broken. that's all we are asking! I dont care if it didnt get fixed for a week or so at least admit there is a problem! this has still not been addressed or even commented on!<br />
It was explicitly said in the Q&amp;A last week that it's not intended for leveling to take longer, or be any more difficult, than it was in 7.3.5. If a mob took around X seconds to kill in 7.3.5, it should still take around X seconds to kill in 8.0.1. If it doesn't, we will fix it - this is an ongoing process.<br />
<br />
I also mentioned earlier in this thread that the inconsistency on the Random Dungeon queue reward was a display issue - you should receive the same bonus each time when doing a random dungeon. We're continuing to forward on the reports about inconsistencies with the end of dungeon completion bonus.<br />
<br />
Yes, you're right, I do realise it's frustrating to be told &quot;make a bug report&quot; - but from my own play experience recently there's definitely mobs out there that are in worse places than others in terms of time-to-kill and damage output. Specific details about the mobs that feel much worse than others allow us to get to those, and alleviate those pain-points more quickly. However, this doesn't mean that the rest of the world won't be looked at.<br />
<br />
Again, the intent is not for leveling to be slower or harder than it was in 7.3.5. When all is said and done it should feel similar to what it was in 7.3.5 and it's something there are people working toward every single day.<br />
<br />

War Mode - Bounty Hunter and Air Supply Drop<br />
Two of the new Battle for Azeroth War Mode features are now enabled in Darkshore.<br />
The 'Bounty Hunter' and 'Air Supply Drop' features are active in Darkshore, and will be active of course in all Battle for Azeroth zones. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1096535-warmode-live/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20766526452?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
<br />
Bounty Hunter System<br />
Infamy has its ups—and its downs. You can become infamous in War Mode by killing a certain number of players of the opposite faction without dying. Once you do, you’ll achieve the status of Assassin and gain an increase to your damage and healing by 15%. Congratulations!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/wm02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/wm02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Of course, there’s a downside to your newfound infamy. The more players an Assassin kills, the more likely they will show up on the zone map for other players to target and kill to gain a bounty. Players who successfully kill an Assassin of the opposite faction will receive Conquest points as well as other rewards. There can be three (or potentially more) Assassins on any Battle for Azeroth zone map at a time, providing plenty of opportunity for players—or groups of players—to take their revenge on the opposite faction’s Assassins.<br />
<br />
Air Drops<br />
From time to time, a flying machine will make its way across the sky. The rumble of its engine is a clear indicator that something is afoot. You’ll want to keep an eagle eye on the sky and watch for a War Supply Crate to drop somewhere in the zone. Similar to the chest in Gurubashi Arena, players can fight over the crate and claim it for their faction. Once a faction has gained control of the crate, anyone of that faction who is within the area will have a short period to open it and collect a piece of personal loot.<br />

War Mode Feedback<br />
World PvP and War Mode<br />
Hey Blizz! Wanna know why we all liked World PvP when it was still good? Because it happened naturally. It was chaotic, unplanned and surprising. You never knew if World PvP was going to happen at all when moving out into the world. Even if you wanted to farm in peace, you could be ganked and harassed at any point. People who didn't want anything to do with it got involved anyway, which was great. You always had this feeling of vulernability in the back of your mind. Amazing stuff.<br />
<br />
Having an option to enable or disable World PvP via War Mode defeats the purpose of this whole system. World PvP only works if players DON'T have the option to disable it, obviously. Enabling War Mode clearly states that you have an intent to go out into the world and do World PvP. Players now plan for it. You expect it, you see it coming. You made it boring and unnatural. There is no chaos or surprise anymore.<br />
I guess I've been having a very different experience to you.<br />
<br />
I've been leveling an alt recently and turned on War Mode. All the feelings you mentioned are feelings I had on a PvP realm, and also feelings I have now in War Mode. Especially now I've hit Northrend.<br />
<br />
When that level 110 lands in front of my character to mine from a node, the hairs on my back stand on end. I don't know they're going to engage or just fly off to the next mining node.<br />
<br />
When I head into an area to kill some mobs for a quest, I don't know if that character 7 levels higher than me is going to attack me or not. We seemingly both just want to get our quests done. There's a wild west stand off kind of moment as we both look at each other, wondering who's going to make the first move, then I get shanked by a Rogue I didn't spot, who starts dancing on my corpse.<br />
<br />
When I need to kill a named mob for one of my quests, and I see someone already fighting it. You bet I'm going to attack them and try to defeat them so I can reset the mob and claim it for my own progress. Sometimes it works, sometimes it backfires and I bite off more than I can chew.<br />
<br />
On PvP realms there were players who were there out of circumstance - who had no interest in PvP'ing. They may have been there because their friends were on that realm, but they just wanted to quest and be done with it. There are some of those players out there in War Mode too, who are simply using it for EXP bonus.

<br />
War Mode and Stormwind / Orgrimmar<br />
Stormwind and Orgrimmar are what we call a &quot;mixed shard&quot; of players who have War Mode enabled and those who don't. <br />
<br />
So if you are invading Stormwind, for example, you will encounter players who are not in War Mode, and currently you'll also find players in War Mode who are not flagged for PvP combat (since this is their territory).<br />
<br />
We're going to do a change soon to make you permanently PvP flagged while in War Mode, which should alleviate situations like Hoofzies'.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback! (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1096533-warmode-is-strange-while-in-capital-cities/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20766236474?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
War Mode and Seeing Other Faction Players<br />
We have warmode on, but the entire zone is empty of Alliance. Kinda lame. <br />
It is likely because there is a significantly greater number of Horde active in War Mode at the moment. Essentially your shard is the &quot;leftover Horde&quot; shard.<br />
<br />
The system maintains a number of shards which attempt to maintain a degree of faction balance within them. When we have an excess of one faction, those are put into their own shard until more of the other faction arises. <br />
<br />
Not ideal, and we're doing what we can to reduce the frequency of that occurrence. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1096532-zero-alliance-in-darkshore/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20766366541?page=1#2))<br />

Responding to Feedback<br />
Why do you think that the class devs forego alpha and beta feedback in which the players playing the game know how things will turn out? then halfway through or at the end, the devs finally admit the alpha/beta testers were right and make changes, only to create new problems for the next expansion that the alpha/beta testers will inevitably mention will happen and get ignored about, again?<br />
So this is good but its a bit hyperbolic. You're not wrong but you're also not right. Of course feedback is listened to and things are changed. Every hotfix or change that we implement we actually can see, so we can follow essentially everything that is happening between QA and Dev. There were hundreds and hundreds of changes(I'm using this as a blanket term here to include everything class related, even bugs) Class Design wise just in the alpha alone. There will always be problems, WoW is a huge behemoth of a project to work on that is so incredibly complex that its hard to get down, even we get it wrong sometimes. <br />
<br />
Just because something doesn't get a response also doesn't mean it was ignored. It could be a number of reasons as to why it wasn't changed to whatever you think it should be. Changing one thing can create a domino effect that has ramifications that we don't for-see. There's an issue right now for example where Inquisition doesn't work correctly with T21 and Divine Purpose, because those two things have not existed on live realms together, but once we fixed that it now causes Inquisition to do something else that is equally unexpected. This is all taking place on the development realms for example so you won't see it in the live game. I know its a pretty niche one-off example but I'm using it because it just came across my inbox.<br />
<br />
There are also times where the Dev team disagrees with the feedback or its because of something else that we can't change it, but I do think where we disagree we should have at least a philosophy somewhere whether its in a Q&amp;A or a blue post somewhere, we at least try to do this. It also doesn't exactly feel very good if you suggest something and we just respond with &quot;No.&quot; So it's a complicated thing sometimes.

Daughter of the Sea Song<br />
Where can we download the song in the Warbringers: Jaina short? That music was really f-cking good and I want it on my phone so I can listen to it on repeat. Any plans to put it available on iTunes? Spotify? Amazon? etc?<br />
Currently at this time it's not downloadable. I'll pass on that you guys were asking for it though and ask.<br />
<br />
I know it wasn't mentioned on this thread but I've seen it asked in a lot of places and wanted to point out that is actually Laura Bailey singing as Jaina Proudmoore and Donal Kearney sings the male lead.

So basically it has zero effect on you?<br />
<br />
Got it. <br />

And as I said no factual basis.<br />

So nice to know this was a pointless conversation with you when asked to provide factual basis as to why LFR should be gated until the next tier or none to explain how it even affects you.<br />

No it dosnt affect ME, but it affects the game as a whole, when ppl get used to being rewarded for not doing anything, it ends up dumbing down the game for everyone, just see how BFA is turning out to be</div></div><hr />

Literally all of those reasons are something to constantly do in the game and reasons to go out in the world... some of the best world pvp was at attunemnt quest spots... it might seem petty but how is doing jack and waiting for 3 weeks better? It gave you a sense of progression for each character, I don’t want “alts” to be the content I want to be able to feel a sense of progression on MY MAIN. Now I literally have every class level capped and geared, no sense of a “main” which seems cool but imo that is not what an mmorpg is about... just my opinion though I highly doubt attunements will ever come back it’s just what the game is now and my way of adapting is just unsubbing every few months :/</div></div><hr />

You need to re-read and re-write what you responded with.<br />
<br />
Retail for the last god knows how many years is patched, bug fixed, restarted on a daily basis. You can't go a week without something going wrong, being moaned about or fixed/nerfed/buffed only for the total opposite to happen the following day or week.<br />
<br />
And regarding Vanilla, the base game is there we all know it we've all been there. Even though playing through on servers of an unofficial nature we know what to expect. There is an expectation, it won't be 100% but they can't release it and patch it daily like retail wow is.<br />

The effort to get to do LFR is leveling up to max level and meeting the ilvl requirement. That is the effort and LFR Raiders shouldn't be treated like second class citizen's just to boost your fucken ego.</div></div><hr />

What a joke to see such a staple of the MMORPG genre utterly ruined because now there's close to nothing to give players when they level up. Choose spec, have more or less your entire arsenal by lvl 40, and enjoy having no customization other than choosing talents (that aren't even needed versus mobs that deal no damage anyway).<br />
This is a major reason why leveling is kept brokenly fast, so that you don't realize how long you can go without actually gaining anything. Garbage band-aid fix and nothing else. Keep it brokenly easy and fast so that all the streamlining and loss of any customization won't be as noticeable.<br />

There is actually quite a few people who care in LFR, mostly those that want to gear up their alts a bit, but don't want to get multiple pugs a week - especially when there is stuff like essences or legendary drops that can come from there. I know I have done that. I could live without LFR tbh, but it is pretty harmless. Toxicity usually comes up when people argue about it, though. Like on forums such as this one.</div></div><hr />

The development team realizes that this is resulting in a very jarring experience moving from Draenor to the Broken Isles, and plans to adjust Legion content to be more in-line with where it should be as leveling content in a future patch.<br />

mob scaling works fine imo, there's a few places where it's a bit funky but not overly out of line.<br />

they're saying sorry for some mobs and encounters being too out of line in 8.0.1. They're not going back to the godmode, fast-levelling, two-shot levelling that was pre 7.3.5.<br />

People who ask for attunements don't really understand what they are asking for. Time gating is so much more convenient, especially for people who don't play for a living.</div></div><hr />

*gets max level titan forge that puts piece of gear on par with mythic difficulty loot*<br />
<br />
You might have a point if war/titan forging wasn't a thing, but it is.<br />
<br />
I have characters that are capable of raiding at least heroic who have never set foot in normal.<br />
<br />
you do realise that titanforging that high is a massive rarity? what a shitty argument, get a hyperbole to support your case, great ass pull my dude</div></div><hr />

A max level titan forge sure. But 15-20 ilvl bump is not super uncommon. Doesn't change the fact that you can without much effort lfr your way into heroic quality gear levels, or better.<br />
<br />
At any rate, my issues are with the war/titan forging system ruining progression at all levels, not just lfr. I don't particularly care about lfr. If that's your thing then more power to you, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was broken though. You'd start questing in Redridge Mountains for example, and the mobs and quests would go green before you even finished the story line there. To level efficiently before you had to keep leaving zones and dropping quests right in the middle of the story because the xp wasn't worth the time to do them. Now you can choose what zones you wish to level in and everything keeps up with you so you get full xp from start to finish. It is so much better now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and Heroic can reforge into Mythic quality gear. Does it really matter if a LFR hero has a couple heroic quality pieces?<br />
<br />
<br />
They did say they planned to keep legions content pacing. Which means 8.1 and the next raid will be out shortly after the new year.<br />
7.1 came out three months after 7.0.3, in October. Nighthold opened with 7.1.5.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said that they were happy with Legion's pacing except for 7.1, which they think was a bit too soon, as the expansion was still fresh for most people.<br />
<br />
I think their plan with 8.1 is probably to hold it off for just a tad longer, maybe 3-5 weeks, pushing the whole release cycle back a bit. Then they can probably find additional 1-2 week delays here or there on other content, which in aggregate will have the long term effect of reducing the eventual gap between 8.3.5 and 9.0.1 down by about 2 months (ie 8.3.5 in March - 9.0.1 in July).</div></div><hr />

We got called tinfoil hat conspiracy lunatics and idiots. I hope all fanboys and people that said those &quot;changes&quot; to make the &quot;new player experience&quot; were great are enjoying the game now. You guys deserve it! Hopefully they will make 1-110 just like 60-80! I'm sure you will all be super happy, after all, Blizzard knows best and would never play you for more money.<br />

LFR is a carebear mode that showers loot for doing literally nothing, so I would have discontinued that mode if I were head dev. Until then, it’s good that real raiders get their content before LFR only ‘raiders’</div></div><hr />

Call it what it is blizzard, a failed experiment and go back to the way it was before 7.3 or whatever patch added mob scaling.<br />
<br />
mob scaling would be ok if they were rewarding decent amount of xp - atm its just put in game to force people into buying boosts - and they succed.<br />

15-20 level up it slightly or on par with normal loot mode<br />
<br />
so any arguments about it being 'equal &quot; to mythic quality loot are making anyone who makes them as compelete idiot</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. If every heirloom had an XP bonus, we could probably reach leveling speed of before 7.3.5 again for veterans who have seen it all and just want to level another alt. And people who enjoy slower leveling don't need to eqip heirlooms. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see how many alts you've leveled since the scaling change. I bet its less than 2% of your total character count...</div></div><hr />
