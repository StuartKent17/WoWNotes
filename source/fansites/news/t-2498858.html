Dps gained alot more dmg with essences while tanks mostly stayed the same, ergo you lose agro now, esspecially on pulls when they pop their laser for example in m+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a tank loses threat due to DPS (not a mob out of range or something), then the tank is doing a poor job hitting the mobs in my opinion. Maybe that's a problem. I miss threat mattering, but I doubt people know what to do these days if playing with a poor tank (like running to the tank or start hitting a different mob rather than increasing their lead).</div></div><hr />

<br />
the opposite was true. a tank cant just choose to do more threat. a dps can choose to do less threat. tanking in vanilla was the same as tanking now. you used your rotation until you didnt need to use it anymore because the little threat meter says youre ok.</div></div><hr />

The thing was, you had to keep up defensives and not run out of rage (or mana for a Pally). Generally, if DPS pulled something off you and taunt was on CD (assuming you had a real taunt), it was tough luck for them.<br />
<br />
As for DPS these days, if you accidentally pull aggro today (and this problem is with snap aggro, so &quot;watch your threat&quot; isn't really a solution) all you can do is stop attacking, hit a defensive (assuming you have one and you're not supposed to be saving it for something), and hope the tank is awake. Those handy threat management tools of yesteryear are gone, aside from Feign Death (of course, a Hunter can also have their pet taunt the mob off them and rez the pet later).<br />
<br />
If tank threat ever really becomes a thing again, those tools will need to come back as well. This is one reason I don't really care for Classic - it had threat, but no management tools, so threat and aggro was mostly about not actually doing anything, and for a fair number of specs praying you didn't crit early in a fight. Rough if your spec is crit-based.<br />
<br />
As it is, going full-out as an Elemental (for example) means owning mobs in AoE pulls fairly often. Not going full-out means not doing much DPS...</div></div><hr />

I hear you.<br />
<br />
Threat was an important mechanic that added so much depth to fights. I missed it when they made it irrelevant, and I say that as a rogue that always needed to manage it to avoid dying. But, you DID learn to manage it, and it was fun as hell once you did. You learned to use your holy shit abilities to get away or cc a mob you got agro from, and everyone had to 'play together' to ensure the tank remained the main threat.<br />
<br />
The idea that threat is an issue right now that needs buffing is comical.</div></div><hr />

I for one used to love using the shot that pulled aggro onto me as a Hunter to save another dps or healer. Last time I used that was to farm Invincible back in... Cata? MoP? Saved many occasions and allowed the tanks to pull that add back to themselves. <br />
<br />
Make things easy, revert to MoP designs (not Classic) and take it from there. Developers (I wish).</div></div><hr />

Now do that as an Enhancement Shaman in Classic or in BC. Get a good windfury proc (entirely up to the rng, so completely out of your control), and manage that. Just as well you get a free self-rez every hour or so.<br />

Being one-shot takes such mad skill. Not attacking to avoid it takes such mad skill. How very hardcore compared to somehow not &quot;playing together&quot; whilst facing mechanics. :rolleyes:<br />

I don't play as tank, but to me it seems there's lots of coordination going on between the 2 main tanks I run with. Surely they're not alone.</div></div><hr />

More on topic, I was wondering why I pulled aggro off some tanks killing stuff around Nazjatar.<br />
<br />
problem is back in the old days threats wasn't just something a tank was entirely responsible for, even the most skilled tank in the world could be easily stripped of agro, it was more so the dps's priority to hold back and watch there threat and keep there dps under the amount needed to strip. which was the reason blizz stated for removing it, it wasnt that tanks found it un fun, it was because dps didn't like it.</div></div><hr />

Matter of opinion, glad you'll have your museum as it pleases you. <br />
<br />
The GCD alone made the game slower to its detriment and they can't revert it soon enough. Additionally, needing to keep more in one's head than a 1-button rotation and a 2-ability boss feels like it might slow the onslaught of dementia, so I'll take it.</div></div><hr />

I mean ideally the best version of the game would be taking certain parts from all xpacs to make a greatest hits, but obviously that wont happen. This leaves the conversation down to a classic vs retail lesser evil situation, in my honest opinion classic has the lesser evil in nearly all situations. Raiding is the only thing i can say WoW has improved on over the years, but an mmo is much more than a raid.</div></div><hr />

Well that focus in development didn't start cropping up until MoP and had a crescendo during Legion. It's retained in BfA but not actualized (until 8.2, 8.3 still in the air) as expertly.<br />
<br />
Everyone disagrees on what makes &quot;greatest hits&quot;, which expansion was good, which was bad, so it couldn't happen even if they tried. If BfA is the new bar for &quot;lower quality&quot; in terms of development, then the game's in for a VERY strong future past its 15th year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's pretty clear to see from the posts you have made on this subject, as to the actual change, the reason threat was nerfed coming out of legion was due to the way as a tank i could just drop my 'aoe' ability (in my case a blood DK D'n'D) and that action alone was enough to snap aggro to me and a single swing with the artifact weapon meant i never lost threat thereafter regardless of what the dps did, not only are the devs so out of touch that they nerfed tank threat, they forgot it wasn't due to tank abilities but more to do with the artifact weapons and skills that came along with them, couple with the fact that they removed the taunt threat increase window which was also a huge help in cases where a dps would pull a mob and you had to taunt it off to stop them being one shot, why they felt that tanks needed the headache of carrying groups while having to play near perfectly with vastly nerfed tools with which to the job is beyond me, furthermore raid tanking and dungeon tanking a 2 very different animals all together, you can be a literal god in raids and be nigh unkillable while playing properly with your team, but in dungeons can be the worst tank ever, and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That made me lol.<br />
<br />
it doesn't happen often but there have been times during this xpac where I've done my entire fucking tank damage rotation (damage = threat) and still have some mobs slip off onto a melee, it just happens when some idiot bursts a single mob without tricks or something. You literally cannot generate anymore threat than pressing all your damage buttons, it's not a case of &quot;just keep aggro&quot;. Then you've got to consider that all tank reactive buttons like FR, LotP etc are all on the GCD, so sometimes you have to skip pressing a damage (threat) button in order to survive.<br />
<br />
Of course none of this is a problem if your DPS aren't brain dead and actually use their toolkit properly.</div></div><hr />

I mean features from xpacs, stuff like professions granting combat bonuses when you max them or reforging (almost everyone i know misses reforging even when at the time they said they didnt like it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And people would still disagree on what was good and what wasn't, and the discourse would remain because the game's never perfect and never was. <br />
Everyone you know =/= everyone that plays the game. I know plenty who didn't mourn Reforging, and plenty who do.<br />
<br />
Although on class design, polls tend to be rather gravitating towards MoP, so maybe that'd be one thing that could be featured comfortably.</div></div><hr />

Generally, if DPS pulled something off you and taunt was on CD (assuming you had a real taunt), it was tough luck for them.<br />
<br />
As for DPS these days, if you accidentally pull aggro today (and this problem is with snap aggro, so &quot;watch your threat&quot; isn't really a solution) all you can do is stop attacking, hit a defensive (assuming you have one and you're not supposed to be saving it for something), and hope the tank is awake. Those handy threat management tools of yesteryear are gone, aside from Feign Death (of course, a Hunter can also have their pet taunt the mob off them and rez the pet later).<br />
<br />
If tank threat ever really becomes a thing again, those tools will need to come back as well. This is one reason I don't really care for Classic - it had threat, but no management tools, so threat and aggro was mostly about not actually doing anything, and for a fair number of specs praying you didn't crit early in a fight. Rough if your spec is crit-based.<br />
<br />
As it is, going full-out as an Elemental (for example) means owning mobs in AoE pulls fairly often. Not going full-out means not doing much DPS...<br />
<br />
Same thing with dh. Sit there and spam demons bite for 5 seconds doing less dps than the tank, because if you eyebeam or crit with chaos strike you're going to rip agro.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
That made me lol.<br />
<br />
it doesn't happen often but there have been times during this xpac where I've done my entire fucking tank damage rotation (damage = threat) and still have some mobs slip off onto a melee, it just happens when some idiot bursts a single mob without tricks or something. You literally cannot generate anymore threat than pressing all your damage buttons, it's not a case of &quot;just keep aggro&quot;. Then you've got to consider that all tank reactive buttons like FR, LotP etc are all on the GCD, so sometimes you have to skip pressing a damage (threat) button in order to survive.<br />
<br />
Of course none of this is a problem if your DPS aren't brain dead and actually use their toolkit properly.<br />
<br />
The typical &quot;I do no wrong, it's all the dps's fault&quot; response. The people like you bitch when DD aren't dealing enough dps, then bitch when they rip agro off you with a single Target crit.</div></div><hr />

Although on class design, polls tend to be rather gravitating towards MoP, so maybe that'd be one thing that could be featured comfortably.<br />

<br />
And then there are players so out of touch they forget that until essenses were introduced in 8.2, tank threat was a non-issue outside of skittish weeks.</div></div><hr />

The game was never slow, people just weren't as good or knowledgeable so the content felt like it required thought. <br />

Eventually overtime Tanks will start to struggle(Not now but later as time goes on). Threat *mattering* in the same context of vanilla...well if you put that idea in now along with all the other mechanics you have to deal with(Especially raid content). That might make Mythic even more absurd then it is now. Vanilla didn't have as many mechanics or rather stuff to watch out for back then, it was there but on the scale after Wrath?<br />
<br />
<br />
No way. Also one shot mechanics are incredibly annoying(Even more so if its fucking random like some mobs in vanilla would randomly drop threat cause reasons). Its one thing to have a near one shot mechanic that has a cast time and the game is telegraphing you &quot;HEY PAY ATTENTION.&quot; Its another to just dpsing a mob down and WAM random one shot. There is no skill in that unless you have Jedi reflexes or have a hard on for Dark Souls.<br />

I like Islands for what they are and Azerite hasn't worked out as they thought, Oh yeah that happens, sometimes new stuff doesn't work out the way we think. Thats just how things happen.

Did you ever level to 60 in vanilla? The level pacing alone added so much to the experience, and there are plenty of pulls that required you to really think it out or risk a wipe (not just in classic this continued up to cata heroics).</div></div><hr />

Clearly? I don't see that at all. I do however recall people claiming that very same thing during Cata, and then we got MoP. Then WoD happened and many wrote the game off completely, but Legion happened all the same. <br />
<br />
Islands are what they are, so is the neck. In certain previous iterations, we had nothing outside of leveling, dungeons, raids. How was that more creative, exactly? There was the odd added area for grinding a reputation but it was still very much old in mechanics to do so. <br />
<br />
The Azerite neck changed with 8.2 to boot, so &quot;at the end of their ropes creatively&quot; sounds more like something someone simply not liking the game anymore would want to believe rather than factual truth.</div></div><hr />

We talking 5 mans? If you ever wiped to trash in a 5 man in vanilla you where playing very, very poorly. The trash was a joke- even if the tank didn't always get threat on it all. Hard trash wasn't really a thing until BC heroic, then it went away in LK, then came back in Cata heroics and pretty much been a thing since then in various modes(challenge mode for MoP and WoD and M+ for legion/BFA).<br />

The problem with that is that the gameplay back then was so much dumbed down that it made sense. When you have 1-2 button rotations, micromanaging becomes something a lot more required for enjoyment. They shifted that to micro-managing within your kits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how you see this as &quot;funny&quot;. Threat levels were exactly where they wanted them to be. Now DPS increases substantially, but tanks have no way to compensate, so they increase it as well, restoring the status quo of before essences were introduced. So in short, nothing between 8.1.5 and 8.2 changes in the end.</div></div><hr />

Most of their abilities were about generating threat. You pushed buttons because you needed to push buttons in order for the enemy to keep hitting you.<br />
<br />
In BFA (and for many previous expansions), the job of the tank is to stay alive. Most of their abilities have survival components in addition to any threat generation. You press a button because you need to in order to live, not because a DPS is gonna strip threat.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've always enjoyed the latter style of tanking and thought the initial threat-based style was boring with the only tiny amount of skill being your reaction time to press Taunt on aggro loss.</div></div><hr />

The Azerite essence system works cause all the essences(Per role that is) are still available to you via unlock not &quot;GET HIS SPECIFIC PIECE AND YOUR FAV TRAITS MAY OR MAY NOT BE ON THERE).

Ive played since ~april of 2006, prior to 8.2 hitting ive never seen this game more barren and that includes the last few months of WoD. If i had to wager a guess WoW was below 2m worldwide subs for the first time ever before a few weeks ago. The thing is blizz doesnt care because the people playing now are spending a ton of money on mounts and shit from the store, i dont have a problem with store mounts but what i do have a problem with is making them such a central focus goal (15 second ads on twitch for 8.2 where all it talks about is new pets, mounts, and toys)......this is an mmo not a collectors game.</div></div><hr />

Yea that's the thing the bad dps don't get this expansion. Only 3 tank specs have good burst AoE threat, the other 3 are either meh or flat out suck.

The new affix also promotes bursting packs with the emissary (2 out of 3 types) and while tank can taunt the primary target back, a lot of dps classes have both abilities and essences with indiscriminate cleave not every tank class can outaggro easily and &quot;reroll to prot warrior&quot; shouldn't be the only answer to that.</div></div><hr />

DPS can go absolutely balls to the wall with their damage, there is no need at all for them to slow down as long as everyone is playing properly. The only time a tank is gonna lose threat is a situation like I described, when MD's and Tricks aren't being used, tanks having dead GCD's to press life saving buttons etc. When everyone does their job it isn't a concern, but the attitude of thinking a tank can just generate more threat even when they are pressing all their buttons is ridiculous, that just means you have no idea how threat works.</div></div><hr />

The new essences give dps players possibilities of crazy burst on packs and the dps essences have lower cooldown than corresponding tank essence. <br />
<br />
The new affix also promotes bursting packs with the emissary (2 out of 3 types) and while tank can taunt the primary target back, a lot of dps classes have both abilities and essences with indiscriminate cleave not every tank class can outaggro easily and &quot;reroll to prot warrior&quot; shouldn't be the only answer to that.<br />
<br />
Its also a matter of what tank specs they play with, both Prot specs and VDH are capable of fast and big AoE damage, the rest really aren't and you can't open up with a damn azerite beam lmao. Just let them die when they pull that shit.</div></div><hr />

If i had to wager a guess WoW was below 2m worldwide subs for the first time ever before a few weeks ago. The thing is blizz doesnt care because the people playing now are spending a ton of money on mounts and shit from the store, i dont have a problem with store mounts but what i do have a problem with is making them such a central figure......this is an mmo not a collectors game.<br />
<br />
You must've been playing with blinders then since WoD literally had players sit in a Garrison that was instanced away. <br />
<br />
As someone that's actually been playing and spending time daily not only in max level content, but in low level zones as well, there's never a time when you don't run into players. The game is every bit as much active and populated as it was during the 14 months of MoP, when it retained 5 million players. My wager this close to 8.2's release would be 6 million, 7-8 million during BfA's release (or more considering the record amount of copies sold) and never going below 5 million considering the release cycles of patches, where Blizzard sits on numbers and can see when MAU sinks below what they find acceptable. <br />
<br />
The game is still an MMO for a fact (Massively Multiplayer Online), MMORPG's tend to have collections. Not having said collections would mean less content, not more.<br />

I was actually in a dundeon the other day where one of the DPS kept pulling mobs off a tank and then running damn near to the other end of the dungeon to &quot;escape&quot; the mob.<br />

When I pointed out that it would be better for all involved if he just ran to the tank, he refused as he didn't want to take damage.<br />

No you are confusing sharding with realms being busy, i have zero doubt that BFA is by far the least populated WoW has been since early vanilla. And again i have no problem with collectors or mounts or anything like that, i have a problem with blizzard making it a goal for players to aim for. It should be a fun side activity, not something you want your entire playerbase striving for, its not good for the game overall.</div></div><hr />

Sharding doesn't magically make players appear where there are none. Those players exist even when they're moved in from a different server to that shard. And as seen in the images above, it's not just in sharded zones.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;zero doubt&quot; isn't worth much seeing as how you'll move the goalposts and try at every turn to make it sound like the game is headed somewhere that others before you claimed it was even when we knew the game to have 12 million subs retained. The problem is that in your mental processing plants, the game sunk with WoD and never stopped sinking despite having expansions launched that completely changed the design philosophies and constant stream of content. <br />
<br />
The game is only about collectibles to people choosing to care about those things. There's still players not giving a crap, only focusing on dungeons, raiding, professions, gold, leveling etc. There's MORE to do, not less, thanks to collectibles (Transmog being one that seems popular with enough to be universal). <br />
<br />
I have zero doubt that BfA has more active players than MoP, a far more divisive expansion that still retained 5 million during a 14 month drought. Clearly, 8.2 made the game even more populated.</div></div><hr />

Clearly i can't prove anything as blizzard does not release sub numbers anymore and for good reason lol. I couldnt care less of who thinks what on a forum, i know for myself this game (at least prior to 8.2) is the lowest its been since probably 2005.

So you've entered every guild possible to gauge?<br />
Server populations = more servers are medium - High - Full than there are low pop, and those server pops are fluid so if they show Full, that's a LOT of players logged in. <br />
<br />
/WHO doesn't show you every player in the zone, but tend to show the max amount even at 4 AM these days across my 3 servers. Random low pop zones show between 20 and 40 players on average, not bad for &quot;content nobody bothers with&quot;. That's before counting the players being phased into the zone.<br />

Nobody likes to believe that something they dislike is successful. Meanwhile, the game's financial reports show otherwise. Hell, the financial power of Retail is what enables Classic to become a reality. Ain't nothing &quot;messed up&quot; about diversifying income, it's clever business. The WoW token no doubt enables MORE people to play as they can pay using gold. Win win situation.</div></div><hr />

All this spec-based arbitration is causing unnecessary problems because post-modern Blizzard hates player agency. Yeah, true, I don't even think every dps is popping their essence to pad mindlessly or fuck with the tank, the design of void emissary and the anti-cc emissary promotes &quot;dump everything into that mob asap&quot; mentality, only the bubble / knockback add is different and usually easily dealt with by a healer throwing some range spells at it. I heard the no-cc guy can still be rooted away but somehow I haven't ran many dungeons in the last 2 weeks with druids, so not sure. <br />
<br />
Point is, dps are trying to do their job, and are punished by the game design. Not lack of skill / willingness from tanks, just the game limitations. Except 1 taunt button tanks don't really have &quot;do more aggro&quot; button, they have the m+ essence on 2m cd (I'll see tomorrow after reset if the cd goes down on rank3), and I'd swear majority of m+ tanks already used gear, stats, trinkets and talents to do as much aoe dps as possible, it's not like they're trading between dps and survivability, survivability is usually just about ilvl and defensive cooldown usage, maybe a trinket and tertiary azerite trait. <br />
<br />
Some people believe there's this mystical world where tanks have a slider &quot;max dps / full paper &lt;----&gt; 0 dps / never die&quot;, and it's a matter of &quot;skill&quot; to find a sweet spot, nope, not really.<br />
<br />
P.S. Also rogues are already the best dps class to invite in m+, having tricks mandatory every time meme beams come off cd is an unnecessary rogue buff which they didn't need.</div></div><hr />

Moving them goalposts yet again.<br />
You're undeappreciating the strength of WoW as a product because you personally do not currently like it. That's all this is, and you merely join the ranks of the same kind of crowd that would denounce any and all Subscriber reports that showed + instead of - to fuel their own narrative. <br />
<br />
They wouldn't be growing their income with fewer players than ever. The occasional mount (which far from everyone will buy) or pet doesn't make up for constant sub numbers. The wow token doesn't function if there's no demand or supply. <br />
<br />
I see new players (achievements) everytime I'm in low level zones leveling an Allied race, despite people claiming for years that the game doesn't pull in new players... Needless to say, forumgoers, especially on these forums, aren't all that reliable in their narrative of &quot;WoW is dying/dead&quot; that's been going for 13 odd years by now.<br />
<br />
BfA being so busy busy busy across servers all the way down to /who (with Twitch WFR viewership between, views on Cinematics etc) with fewer players than &quot;ever before&quot; would be nothing short of a miracle that they'd need to share with other online gaming companies, because man does it feel good to see, that should be bottled.</div></div><hr />

WoW's micro transactions are benevolent compared to what struggling F2P titles pull, and that's something I can live with. <br />
<br />
The fact that it's been pretty constant since WOTLK in terms of what is offered in the store says it's a solid system, but not perfect, since perfection would mean everyone would partake. And the store clearly isn't universally utilized nor liked.</div></div><hr />

The GCD alone made the game slower to its detriment and they can't revert it soon enough. Additionally, needing to keep more in one's head than a 1-button rotation and a 2-ability boss feels like it might slow the onslaught of dementia, so I'll take it.<br />

Calling it a museum = not my idea, saw it used by Classic players happy to have the game preserved in that time, and goes with the fact that some of you proclaim to want the slower pace and less hectic gameplay that you know won't change. <br />
<br />
If I come across as condescending to them, that's something I can live with, because that's my point. I've been involved in countless discussions about Classic that didn't involve such elements, the odd outlier is acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tanked in Legion, and the last time I tanked prior to that was WotLK. I distinctly remember enjoying threat greatly. It encouraged me to cycle between mobs, either to maintain threat consistently across a pack, or more often to counteract a threat spike. I usually marked targets of priority to ensure that players put the bulk of their threat on a particular mob. Threat kept me on my toes as I couldn't lock a pack down without a bit of target switching, unless my DPS were very well behaved.<br />
<br />
Yes, a tank should go through their rotation anyway, but threat was more of a thing when tanking more than 1 mob at a time.<br />

Fair enough. Though the implication is clear. Classic isn't mentally-stimulating enough to you. I can respect that opinion. No harm done.<br />
I feel raiding will probably be as you say. Which is why I'll be mostly PvPing, I think. I'm a bit apprehensive about 1 or 2 button rotations. PvP won't have the same simplicity -- should be more stimulating for me.<br />
<br />
Truth be told I'm one of those people who will play classic in the ultimate hope that it's successful enough to encourage blizzard to try out TBC or WotLK legacy servers. To me, those expansions represented the time period where the game had the original, more &quot;traditional&quot; RPG-based design philosophies, yet rotations started to become more engaging, and more specs became viable.</div></div><hr />

Clearly i can't prove anything as blizzard does not release sub numbers anymore and for good reason lol. I couldnt care less of who thinks what on a forum, i know for myself this game (at least prior to 8.2) is the lowest its been since probably 2005. The messed up part is blizzard is probably making close to what they did in the wrath/cata days because of mounts/pets and most importantly the WoW token.<br />
<br />

In all fairness, although CC has never been difficult, I do recall that years ago, as soon as a CC (except sap) landed, the rest of the pack immediately became aggro'd. It wasn't a huge deal for a coordinated group -- they could simply time their CC to go off simultaneously -- but for PuGs I do remember some nasty deaths due to this old aggro behaviour.<br />

<br />
The fact that it's been pretty constant since WOTLK in terms of what is offered in the store says it's a solid system, but not perfect, since perfection would mean everyone would partake. And the store clearly isn't universally utilized nor liked.<br />
<br />
Queenie...read your back and forth on WoW subscriber's number<br />
<br />
1) NEITHER of you presented any real, concrete evidence one way or another (and your random screen shots prove absolutely nothing)<br />
<br />
2) There is a reason Blizz stopped reporting Subscriber numbers. It's the same reason Apple stopped reporting the number of iPhones sold (and I'm a big fan of Apple btw). <br />
<br />
The reason should be self-evident but I'll explain it to you anyway. There was virtually no way either company was capable of maintaining their rate of growth (subscribers for Blizzard and sales for Apple). Both companies knew that not only were they incapable of repeating past success but that their market had &quot;matured&quot; to the point that the most likely result would be year or year declines (in subscribers / sales of iPhones). There is reliable evidence to support a decline in Apple sales available and even by your own admission, where you estimated BFA subscriber numbers, those numbers are way down from the peak subscriber numbers in Wrath.<br />
<br />
3) Both Blizzard and Apples are refocusing efforts on services (in Blizzards case in-game microtransaction, in Apple's case new revenue streams from Apps, other products and new services like the upcoming Apple TV) and the other guy was right to point this out. Blizzard benefits from their micro transaction financially and from designing some or all of their gaming systems to increase MAU's - that's why you've had a version of Azerite Power and mission tables for 3 consecutive expansions. Apple Services / Apps keep you within their ecosystem and spending money as well even if you aren't buying a new phone as often. <br />
<br />
4) Neither company is doomed and because of micro transactions both companies can remain as profitable as they once were, despite declines in sales, for an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
5) It's not WoW hating to say there are less WoW subscribers today than in the past. Most reasonably objective people concede there are fewer subscribers today than in the past (even your own estimates agree with this conjecture)<br />
<br />
6) If either Apple or Blizzard remotely approached past sales peak (phones sold in a quarter / year or subscribers) you could bet every last nickel you had that they would find a way to mention that in their quarterly report even though neither company &quot;officially&quot; reports those numbers anymore.<br />
<br />
7) take a deep breath and enjoy the version of the game you like best</div></div><hr />

And yet BfA sold record amounts of copies, which they did report. And of course, it was &quot;debunked&quot; as untruthful or warped.<br />
<br />
Apple and Blizzard are not the same company, nor do they have the same market. They stopped reporting sub numbers (WoD, obviously) and went over to MAUs, and MAUs have room for growth just fine. We can no longer say which portion of their MAUs are in which title, but financial growth won't happen without keeping players engaged and attracting new ones. The store isn't nearly enough of what it'd need to be to make up for a tiny playerbase.<br />
<br />
Whilst I myself am 100% on board with the notion that WoW hasn't retained 12 million subs since WOTLK, I'm 100% off board on this idea that the game is now harboring 2 million players or less across all regions despite there having been 2 expansions, both of which doing the polar opposite of WoD, since the time when they stopped reporting subs. And let's not forget, even when they did report subs, people would maintain they weren't truthful. MAUs work better for corporate speak with the added bonus that anyone saying that WoW has 1 million subs, or 12 million, will be speculating.<br />
<br />
My speculation is that the game is doing better than during the 14 months of literal drought that followed a polarizing expansion like MoP. BfA just had a new patch and is only halfway to its end, yet it'd somehow be performing worse than WoD? Nope, that &quot;logic&quot; is clearly based in the need to believe that the game is doing poorly &quot;without the me&quot;, a notion not too uncommon on these forums.<br />
<br />
In the end, it's speculation. I get that, people such as the one I've been going back and forth with, doesn't. And I for one think they should be challenged in their perpetual &quot;lul dead gaem&quot;-narrative that was old 10 ducking years ago. <br />
<br />
As I said, if Blizzard's found a way to make the game seem as busy as it has been since 8.2 without it being that busy in reality, they need to bottle and sell that shit to struggling game companies.<br />
<br />
That's my exit out of this thread and meaningless back-and-forth (since 10 years from now this discussion will still be running). Anno 1800 awaits!</div></div><hr />

Tanking requires quite a bit more thought than spamming 1 button for threat generation (that even allowed AFK tanking at times) these days.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue that you were debating was about subscriber numbers not launch day sales. They are 2 wholly different things. I, for example, bought BFA but am no longer a subscriber. And the fact that Blizzard released that info further supports my argument that if the actual subscriber numbers were record setting they would report that too and they haven't which is all you really need to know.<br />
<br />
The Blizzard / Apple comparison was an analogy and a valid one at that. They obviously aren't the same company and don't have the same market but they, and most business, operate in very similar ways and both have at one time or another been a dominant market player and both have since seen some retrenchment from their peaks which it is why it's an apt comparison.<br />
<br />
I also think you are vastly underestimating the &quot;store&quot;. Selling re-coloured mounts is probably the most profitable thing Blizzard does which is also why with well over 200 mounts already in the game that no one can possibly use 8.2 is probably the patch with the most mount related content in WoW history ()some geared to MAU participation and some geared to store sales). The addition of the WoW token is generating oodles of money for them too that they didn't have in the first decade of the game existence.<br />
<br />
As I said, adding all these things together means BFA could have 2 million subscribers or it could have 8 million subscribers and Blizzard is making as much money as before when they had 11 million plus subscribers because they have become better at monetization of their subscriber base (and in fact create systems to appeal to that type of customer)<br />
<br />
But, and you're probably not going to like this, the biggest reason to suspect that actual subscriber numbers are down is the pending release of Classic. How many times did Blizzard say they would never go back and do Classic (they even lied about not having the game files on hand for pete's sake). About as many times as they said they would never do a WoW token and then eventually did. If the trajectory of WoW was as rosy as you think Classic would never have been released. As I said in my original post, many of the in-game systems in BFA are thinly veiled mechanisms designed to increase MAU despite a lower subscriber base. While the developers try to cloak these devices in lore or some other justification it's all about the MAU's / monetization now. The reversal on doing Classic, though I'm grateful for it, is more of the same. It's not being done out of kindness. It's being done for monetary reasons and because the overall trajectory of WoW is on the decline (as almost any game 15 years would be). If Blizzard was still at Wrath subscriber levels, in addition to all their current monetization mechanism in place, they would continue to laugh at people that wanted Classic instead of trying to cash in on their past glory. <br />
<br />
Anyway, enough said, peace out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're pretty much spot on in your comment. Neither Classic nor Retail are difficult per se. <br />
<br />
There are differences though. I consider Classic more challenging rather than difficult. There was at least some risk of dying doing world content and dungeons weren't a complete AOE face roll. While people always claim that rotations and boss mechanics were easy peazy in Classic they forget that the limited boss mechanics were partly the result of the limited toolkit players had, including debuff limit, threat management etc, to respond to the boss mechanics. The difficultly in raids has to be considered in relative terms not just by comparing number of mechanics. If Classic was as easy as people claim, relatively speaking when compared to today's game, a whole lot more guilds would have cleared BWL and Naxx.<br />
<br />
The only thing truly challenging in Retail is those things you site. The better balance of &quot;relatively&quot; challenging elements in Classic, imho, resulted in both a more well rounded and rewarding experience. <br />
<br />
But at the end the day the, admittedly, rather pointless debate would be better served if people spoke in terms of challenges rather than difficulty.</div></div><hr />

This change is trash and just a horrible band aid. The underlying problem is that tank damage is not scaling at anywhere near the same rate as dps. This is a never ending problem due to scaling issues. What they should be doing is focusing on tank damage. Right now prot warriors and prot paladins are a bit out of control with the damage they are capable of and their mitigation this season. We should have seen a tuning pass by today. I seriously think they have no idea what to do and they are to focused on fixing their miserable design in 9.0. Rather than going over what each spec needs and adjusting them they are just throwing a bandaid over the entire issue because they cant be bothered to pull out a calculator.<br />
<br />
I am seriously confused on how they can create naz and mechagon but they are incapable of tuning classes. It's almost like they just threw their hands up in the air and said screw it this garbage is broken we will fix it in another expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it doesn't happen often but there have been times during this xpac where I've done my entire fucking tank damage rotation (damage = threat) and still have some mobs slip off onto a melee, it just happens when some idiot bursts a single mob without tricks or something. You literally cannot generate anymore threat than pressing all your damage buttons, it's not a case of &quot;just keep aggro&quot;. Then you've got to consider that all tank reactive buttons like FR, LotP etc are all on the GCD, so sometimes you have to skip pressing a damage (threat) button in order to survive.<br />
<br />
Of course none of this is a problem if your DPS aren't brain dead and actually use their toolkit properly.What toolkit would that be? Two classes have tricks/misdirect (Rogues and Hunters). Mages have a complete threat dump on a long CD. A pally can bubble, and assuming the tank is on the ball they'll have some time to pick the mob back up. Other than that there are no 'tools'.<br />
<br />
In this day and age, everything is expected to be cleared fast. Sitting and waiting for the tank to drop their AoE effect, and then hit each and every mob properly before starting AoE is absurd, but that's what you seem to be asking of those specs that have high snap aggro (usually also very rng as well, so there's no predicting it). You're basically asking Elementals to leave their AoE toolkit at home, and probably a number of other specs as well.</div></div><hr />

Same with sharding. They keep bandaging every single problem it causes. The WQ group finding stuff with the addon and most recently the Battle for Nazjatar. There is also this lag that can occur.

<br />
Not entirely the problem is never the tank loosing aggro in later stages but losing aggro as he pulls them, especially if you are playing with high burst dpsers, most of the times it's actually dpsers being too hasty in the start. I'm usually parsing purple/orange for DPS as a tank and it was fairly common if you pull a pack of mobs in a m+ dungeon and they insta burst them you are bound to lose threat in the first 3-5 seconds on some tanks if you don't have your high dps cds available.</div></div><hr />

And one of friends at time put some satire on fact that when they &quot;pruned&quot; back then, they did it not only with interesting and useful spells for classes as fantasy representatives, but also those which were responsible for resources management during encounters in those immemorial times (https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-is-the-point-of-rogues-in-raids/64499). And threat was just one of main such ones (which can be learned in sufficient detail and with a certain form of contempt from first link), it was mutual resource of all people in the group together, which demand them to act as solid one. Therefore, what prevents current representatives of &quot;educated&quot; PvE community to include such abilities in their rotation and teach that to rest of &quot;not so educated&quot; ones... it can't be that you really just have nothing left (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Threat), or can it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avx81</div><div class="date">2019-07-25, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">or buff underperforming tank specs that do bad damage ?<br />
<br />
Because that would involve buffing specs like Blood DK. And god knows we cant buff Blood DK even though prot warriors make up 50% of the highest keys done. Right now I have had groups scoff at the fact that they invited a ~430 BDK over a warrior. Had a healer moaning about it at first in a KR 11 that we 2 chested with no problem.<br />
<br />
As of S2 the highest keys were being done by prot warriors and more recently also prot paladins. Both do absurd amounts of damage. More specifically prot warriors. Even after the avatar nerf its insane.<br />
<br />
Right now you have prot warriors with the highest defense and the highest offense of all the tanks. I'm all for unbalance if it creates some level of balance overall. In other words the tanks with the highest amount of defense should not have the highest offense. If you want to be a tank with the highest defense you should not blow away every other tank in damage. Plain and simple. If you want the most damage output then your defensive ability should be lower but not so low that you are just getting randomly killed every pull. I just got done watching a prot warrior spiking to close to 100k dps on trash pulls while barely taking any damage in the range of +15-20 keys. Literally health barely moving if at all in as high as +20 keys on fortified. Compared to my Blood DK right now I get my face smashed at ~430 ilvl on regular trash pulls in ~+12 keys. They are now going for 2 seasons being the strongest tank by a mile considering how much damage they do and their health barely gets tickled in +20 keys while face tanking everything.<br />
<br />
To make things remotely balanced they would have to revert the DK armor nerf and buff their damage substancially but that will never happen because this is all being done in the name of balancing class representation for the rest of this expansion. Right now prot warriors look like S1 Blood DK in terms of the highest key representation but nothing is being said or done. You had people screaming bloody murder on the forums about Blood in S1 but now that warriors are king in terms of defense and damage output by a mile nobody is saying a thing. Nobody including warriors thought they would make it to S3 untouched. Blizzard barely gave them a slap on the wrist.</div></div><hr />

But I have this sneaking suspicion that it won't manage to for very long. :)<br />
<br />
It won't, they'll be back to say &quot;look how well classic is doing, Blizz should make x changes to retail to be like classic&quot; and I'll be here to tell them to just get off retail and go play classic :)</div></div><hr />

All the game pacing systems need to slow down, not just combat.<br />
<br />
Wasn't the GCD change one of the most reviled parts of BFA?</div></div><hr />
