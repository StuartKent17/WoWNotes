Patch 7.3.5 - New Features<br />
While Patch 7.3.5 has yet to hit the PTR, we did find out some of the features it includes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Old World Zone Scaling<br />
<br />
Racial Starting Zones - 1 to 10<br />
Classic Zones - 10 to 60<br />
Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King Zones - 60 to 80<br />
Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria Zones - 80 to 90<br />
Warlords of Draenor Zones - 90 to 100<br />
Legion Zones - 100 to 110<br />
<br />
Ulduar Timewalking Raid<br />
New Seething Shore Battleground<br />
<br />
Horde and Alliance will face off in Silithus for the Azerite bubbling to the surface.<br />
Fight for dynamically shifting points across the map.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormwind and Orgrimmar Updates in Battle for Azeroth<br />
Ian Bates (Red Shirt Guy) (https://twitter.com/TheRedShirtGuy) has released a blog post (http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/updates-stormwind-orgrimmar-battle-azeroth-demo) on Blizzplanet (http://www.blizzplanet.com/) detailing some interesting info from the BfA BlizzCon demo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each city will now have an embassy linked to the recruitment of Allied Races. <br />
The Orgrimmar embassy resides in what was the Goblin Slums.<br />
The Stormwind embassy is behind the Dwarven District.<br />
Sylvanas Windrunner, Varok Saurfang, Baine Bloodhoof, Lady Liadrin, Rokhan, Lor’themar Theron, Trade Prince Gallywix, Ji Firepaw, Eitrigg, and Nathanos Blightcaller reside in the Orgrimmar Embassy. <br />
Saurfang, Baine and Nathanos each have a brand new model.<br />
The Stormwind Embassy contains Anduin Wrynn, Turalyon, Alleria Windrunner, Tyrande Whisperwind, Velen, Genn Greymane, High Tinker Mekkatorque, Muradin Bronzebeard, Aysa Cloudsinger, and Wrathion. <br />
Wrathion isn't standing next to the others.<br />
When visiting these locations, the faction leaders in both places discuss finding allies for the war and eventually ask you to pick a race to go after. <br />
Currently Horde could only choose between Highmountain Tauren and the Nightborne.<br />
Alliance could select Void Elves or Lightforged Draenei. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Interviews<br />
We're continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews.<br />
<br />
PCGamesN Interview with Ion Hazzikostas<br />
PCGamesN (https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/wow-patch-735-level-scaling-ulduar-timewalking) was able to sit down with Ion Hazzikostas (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev).<br />
<br />
<br />
The hard modes will be preserved for Ulduar timewalking in 7.3.5.<br />
Vanilla content scales to 60.<br />
Potential to add the old world zones as a Timewalking event.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jessie Cox Interview<br />
Jessie Cox (https://twitter.com/JesseCox) sat down on the show floor with Ion Hazzikostas.<br />

<br />
<br />
Vol’jin’s physical manifestation is dead, but we likely haven’t seen the last of his spirit.<br />
Thrall may have Vol’jin’s urn.<br />
Minute one of the new expansion takes place right after the cinematic.<br />
Allied races fit with the theme of this expansion.<br />
Warfronts are “raid vs army” instead of “raid vs giant boss.”<br />
Heavily built up faction hubs in BfA<br />
High Elves are pretty much Blood Elves and so it’s unlikely they will be a playable race.<br />
No third faction is planned<br />
Uldir is a traditional troll raid with slight Old God/Titan themes.<br />
No plans for account bound item stash right now but it’s a good idea, especially for crafting materials.<br />
Gear slots affected by the Heart of Azeroth (head, shoulder, chest) will not Warforge/Titanforge.<br />
The patch cycle will be similar to Legion.<br />
A separate team is doing World of Warcraft: Classic.<br />
World of Wacraft: Classic will take a lot of community feedback.<br />
Pacing and requirements to unlocking flying are subject to tweaks.<br />
Kezan is not currently planned to be more than a dungeon.<br />
There are no current plans for Gnome Paladins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rolling Stone Interview<br />
Rolling Stones (http://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/battle-of-azeroth-wow-game-director-discusses-expansions-w511011) talked to the WoW Devs.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team likes the story to flow from one expansion to the next instead of in previous ones where a completely different story popped up between each of them.<br />
The team wants to give something to every playstyle in every expansion.<br />
BfA is more about the story and improving systems rather than making major gameplay changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Polygon Interview with WoW Devs<br />
Polygon (https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/3/16597166/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-news-features-reveal-wow-new-expansion) sat down with the WoW Devs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Void elves will have a short-range teleport as a racial.<br />
The team is thinking about bringing the faction conflict into dungeons and raids.<br />
BfA is also about the world dying beneath our feet.<br />
Progression of the Heart of Azeroth is not spec specific like the artifact weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
DigitalTrends Interview with Muffinus<br />
Digtaltrends (https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-interview/) interviewed Jeremy Feasel. (AKA Muffinus)<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts let you contribute to victory in any way you want. You can focus on combat while someone else can go chop wood or mine ore.<br />
Existing characters are now front and center to the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzplanet Interview<br />
Blizzplanet (http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzcon-2017-jeremy-feasel-interview-world-warcraft-battle-azeroth) sat down with Muffinus as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zhU9AvMlAQM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
You will have to finish Legion to figure out Illidan’s future.<br />
Bwonsamdi (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Bwonsamdi) (the Loa of death) plays a major role in Zandalar.<br />
Blood Trolls (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blood_troll) are under the servitude of a powerful new creature that you will meet in the very first raid of this expansion.<br />
Uldir (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uldir) only has one of its three seals remaining on it. During the course of the expansion, you are going to find out what happens to that last seal.<br />
Drust (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Drust) people were a society wiped out in Drustvar (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Drustvar) that now exists as spirits trying to work their way back into the world.<br />
Another random event in Warfronts could be major figures such as Jaina showing up and rallying the raid to help her fight to take over a point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanion Interview with Muffinus<br />
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/news/battle-for-azeroth-interview-mit-jeremy-feasel-viel-lore-und-spoiler-17370) also interviewed Muffinus.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ending cinematic to Antorus is epic and will answer a lot of lingering questions while raising new ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
GameSpot Interviews John Height<br />
GameSpot (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wows-battle-for-azeroth-expansion-might-be-the-bes/1100-6454665/) interviews John Height.<br />
<br />
<br />
The burning of Teldrassil is the event that causes the Alliance to lay siege to the Undercity.<br />
Anduin’s moment in the cinematic is him realizing what he is really about, healing over fighting.<br />
BfA is a more personal story instead of a “big bad” one.<br />
There will still be zones that are 1-20 to get new players acclimated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hotted &amp; Asmongold Interview<br />
Hotted (https://twitter.com/hotted89) and Asmongold (https://twitter.com/Asmongold) also did an interview.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOkw1BSzBKI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
No plans for more solo challenge content like the mage tower in BfA but it’s definitely a possibility.<br />
New World PVP systems should even out Horde and Alliance on PVP shards.<br />
Small revamps to existing PVP talents to keep rotations similar between PVE and PVP.<br />
Team is talking about adding Mythic + to old world dungeons, but not yet planned for BfA.<br />
No current plans for Mythic + raids.<br />
4 difficulty options for raids will continue in BfA.<br />
No change to mythic raid size.<br />
Not looking to add a ton of new abilities to classes, but this could change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff Kaplan Weighs in on World of Warcraft: Classic<br />
Jeff Kaplan was asked about classic WoW servers by r/overwatch (https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7bdyby/blizzcon_2017_interview_jeff_kaplan_bill_warnecke/). Here is a quick recap:<br />
<br />
<br />
Thinks it's a great idea.<br />
It's the sense of community that made classic WoW great.<br />
Lack of systems such as server transfer led to building a reputation, good or bad, on your server.<br />
It was not the quests he designed that made the game great.<br />
Game design isn't black and white. Players need to also look at what they are giving up when asking for things.<br />

Alliance gets Void Elves, which use the same model as Blood Elves. So, High Elves with a Void twist. Same difference, really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soluna</div><div class="date">2017-11-08, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alliance gets Void Elves, which use the same model as Blood Elves. So, High Elves with a Void twist. Same difference, really.<br />
<br />
Thing is, Void elves use the same model, but they are more than an eye tint. Highmountain taurens or dark iron dwarves, heck, even lightforged draenei, have a distinctly different skin color among other features like tattoos and such. Only difference between High elves and Blood elves are their eyes. Void elfs have different eyes, different skin color, and apparently, a slightly more 'voidy' form during combat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiase</div><div class="date">2017-11-08, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh for crying out loud<br />
<br />
How does Blizzard explain the fact that Sylvanas initiated the attack on teldrassil? It's not enough with the fact that the alliance already thought the horde backstabbed them on the broken shore, which lead to the death of their king, but all of a sudden Sylvanas thinks the best course of action to celebrate the defeat of the legion by lighting a huge ass bonfire in the middle of the ocean?<br />
<br />
On top of that, in the current expansion we have class halls, social hubs where classes put aside their difference and hang out and work together. To shit on all of that right after the expansion ends just feels so cheap.<br />
<br />
Blizzard really is just pulling random shit out of their gaping asshole at this point. While the whole plot for BfA is stupid as hell considering how the two factions have always teamed up, especially when you look at Legion it would at least have made a bit more sense if it was the Alliance that initiated the attack on the Horde as revenge for their king, and Sylvanas retaliating.<br />
<br />
God the plot is just getting worse and worse as the expansions come out. Perhaps once WoW is dead Blizzard might make a Warcraft 4 just to milk the of the last bit of money out of the franchise before it is laid to rest.</div></div><hr />

No seriously, explain fucking why. It's not enough with the fact the alliance already thought the horde backstabbed them on the broken shore, which lead to the death of their king, but all of a sudden sylvanas thinks the best thing to do is to fucking light a bonfire in the middle of the ocean?<br />

<br />
Well, let's not jump to conclusions here. It was stated that the burning of Teldrassil led to the assault, but not that the Horde did it. There could be a 3rd party here, or a misunderstanding, rogue agents, or something else that led the horde to do this. It's probably not just &quot; Horde are baddies&quot;.<br />
<br />
EDIT: There is also a screen where Sylvanas is approaching the tree, where the enviroment around is already in flames with swords/flags scattered and a wounded elf. <br />
The tree is also (likely) covered with Azerite.<br />
The next screen has the wounded elf been mended to.</div></div><hr />

It was already mentioned that there was large amounts of Azerite at Teldrassil. Also, it's really interesting that Wrathion is in Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

Why bother? The answer would just be &quot;No.&quot;<br />

Allied Races are races that can be edited from existing races. Ogres would have to be a brand new race and they aren't doing any of those in BFA.</div></div><hr />

Because Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria zones will be lvl 80-90. You can do all your leveling in Pandaria after hitting level 70 (unless they tone down XP gain by a lot that you have to do more than the whole continent to get 10 levels).</div></div><hr />

I think it will be the latter. You still have some order for zones, but you're not forced to leave zone after 15 quests.</div></div><hr />

So I'm not a 100% clear on this but when they say vanilla zones will scale from 10-60 does that mean if I walk into the Burning Steppes with a freshly dinged level 10 will all the mobs and quests be level 10 and available to me or will they still be at 49-52 but can scale up to 60? I'm just curious as to how it's going to work as we've only had level scaling from a base level of 100 up to 110 as opposed to stuff scaling down due to levels.<br />

I believe they said they want us to pick and choose where we go, so all zones will scale to your level.</div></div><hr />

&quot;What reasons? We nearly had Ogres in Cataclysm, they're more popular among the population than pandas and have been a long standing allied race of the horde, the game should have launched with ogres instead of undead (I say this as an undead main since vanilla) and in cataclysm we ended up with Goblins, again less popular than Ogres.&quot;<br />

Well... not really, as they are in the same faction that have those races, excluding those that have such a different looks that will be seen as a different race easily from afar (Nightborne and Night Elf, and Blood Elf with Void Elfs). <br />

I was thinking about that, maybe he bites the dust with Teldrassil, it may give much more reason for Tyrande to be aggressive -not just passive aggressive like she have been in Legion- (if that happen i would like her to go to Suramar and reclaim that place for her people -that was the city she was born in, in the end-, making the Horde &amp; Nightborne alliance more interesting, and to make the fight between the Nightborne and the Alliance make more sense.)</div></div><hr />

Yeah I get the whole Void Elf thing, I just don't like the Devs reasoning. Pandas look the exact same regardless of faction. Lightforged Dranaei will look the exact same when you get them in armor. Yes I know they're in the same faction but the concept remains. How are you to tell the difference unless they have their helmet as invisible and you can see they have golden eyes....which is a big difference in Blood and High Elves as well.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but the devs pointed out that they didn't liked how the whole Pandaren thing ended up as. (exactly because of that)<br />

Their only problem have been with the same looks in different factions. <br />

<br />

<br />
Pointed out the true reason above, but still there are some small differences.<br />
<br />
1-The Horns can be seen through the helmet.<br />
<br />
2-The Naaru mark in front of their faces is permanent<br />
<br />
3-Their tails are quite different (have all those golden things, most likely the biggest difference for the player of that race, as you will look at them from the back most of the time.<br />
<br />
4- I think they also got plate things on their faces (side of the faces). -so the character portrait would easily show they are LF.<br />
<br />
Note: I do agree that they are a lot alike (but the Horde gets Highmountain so i'm ok with that, and a part of me like highmountain, mostly cause i liked the zone in Legion and loved their armor styles -Hope the Horde get those lovely eagle mounts!-)<br />
<br />
Note2: They should have gone with the Demon Hunter route and make their equipment show more skin than the normal Draneai race (to be able to enjoy those nice golden tattoos)</div></div><hr />

I actually like that it's hard telling which panda is alliance or horde. Makes the faction wars more compelling.

<br />
IDK about the jade forest bit. Admittedly though I never 100% the zone while leveling toons, but if I had to guess, I would say it take at least 2 zones to hit 90 from 85.... But your point dose stand that there is more then enough questing space to skip ether cata or MoP<br />

did not like any of the winners, liked them much more when they were all machinima :/<br />
<br />
Ya I have to say the 3 winners where all very Meh to me. None of them made me laugh or feel anything really. The second place one especially seemed to be more of a story on how two friends met with a little bit of wow spliced in then an actual movie..... I mean i don't want to say that the 3 shouldn't be up there, but I also miss machinima from the likes of Nixxiom and other people.</div></div><hr />

The burning of Teldrassil is the event that causes the Alliance to lay siege to the Undercity.<br />

Does that confirm that Teldrassil wil happen in like 7.3.5 or even another patch before 8.0 ?</div></div><hr />

VERY MISLEADING. In the actual article, he's merely pointing out the order in which we saw the events happening via the videos shown. The burning of Teldrassil was in the reveal/features trailer, THEN shown the attack on Lordaeron in the cinematic second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I will be playing Alliance in the next expansion to some degree like in WoD (and play the Horde most of the time, because Nightborne and Zandalari), to get a glimpse on that part of the story - but I am really tired of Blizzard's Horde storytelling.<br />
<br />
You know, underdogs are often painted evil by the lies and propaganda of their enemies. This would somehow fit the beginning of Legion storyline, where the Horde is seen as traitors, while they just have been overwhelmed by the enemies (because the Alliance relied on faulty intelligence by their compromised SI:7). <br />
<br />
But if Jaina is proven right and the Horde is not to be trusted (at least not the leaders of the Horde), then Blizzard once and for all destroys the underdog theme of the Horde and instead creates a black and white universe which we already have in Lord of the Rings, for example. And having 2 morally ambigous factions was one of the most appealing things regarding the WoW storyline and lore for me. <br />
<br />
I really hope that this all is just framing by the Old Gods...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highelf</div><div class="date">2017-11-09, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The horde have all leaned on alliance heroes throughout it's history, especially during Legion. Why exactly did we need the horde again? Jaina was right. Thrall is the only example of the other way around. It's time the Alliance stops being so passive.<br />
<br />
Then the horde get one shot by random demon mobs during the broken shore event. The orcs are weak willed folk. They drink the blood of a demon to become bloodthirsty and don't even conquer one continent. Then Garrosh changes the timeline so that they don't, but are instead drinking the kool-aid of Garrosh and literally planning and doing the same exact thing by building a portal to invade(which again fails miserably). They destroy their own home planet, and are working to destroy this one. They are terrorists.</div></div><hr />

The leveling experience for me in WoD has been reduce to a treasure grind. Maybe it's just me, but I feel no joy going through the WoD zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say WoD had the best levelling experience in my opinion. Of course that doesn't suddenly negate all the other flaws that expansion had.<br />
<br />
Yeah I mean you can do the treasure method but it's still decent to level through. Only 2 zones I found meh were Gorgrond early on and Talador until the Battle for Shattrath.<br />
<br />
I get where you are coming from though. A few of my friends aren't particularly fond of the WoD levelling experience and they just treasure hunt through it.<br />
<br />
Personally I think scaling should be applied everywhere from 1-100 at least.</div></div><hr />

I liked the WoD leveling while the expansion was current. But not after 8+ alts..<br />
<br />
I think they should put a minimum limitation on some zones... I don't feel like a level 1 should be able to go to Icecrown or something like that. And maybe Elwynn Forrest shouldn't go to level 100 either :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
How does Blizzard explain the fact that Sylvanas initiated the attack on teldrassil? It's not enough with the fact that the alliance already thought the horde backstabbed them on the broken shore, which lead to the death of their king, but all of a sudden Sylvanas thinks the best course of action to celebrate the defeat of the legion by lighting a huge ass bonfire in the middle of the ocean?<br />
<br />
On top of that, in the current expansion we have class halls, social hubs where classes put aside their difference and hang out and work together. To shit on all of that right after the expansion ends just feels so cheap.<br />
<br />
Blizzard really is just pulling random shit out of their gaping asshole at this point. While the whole plot for BfA is stupid as hell considering how the two factions have always teamed up, especially when you look at Legion it would at least have made a bit more sense if it was the Alliance that initiated the attack on the Horde as revenge for their king, and Sylvanas retaliating.<br />
<br />
God the plot is just getting worse and worse as the expansions come out. Perhaps once WoW is dead Blizzard might make a Warcraft 4 just to milk the of the last bit of money out of the franchise before it is laid to rest.<br />

<br />
I'm thinking the mobs will drop cloth based on the normal level of the zone they're in, so level 60 cloth droppers in Northern Barrens will still drop linen/wool cloth.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure the developers did not mean a total rework of the entire old world like it was in Cataclysm, but more like update only certain parts of the world, like it was for Theramore and how it'll be for Silithus.<br />

I, for one, do not mind Blizzard updating certain areas of the old world to reflect consequences of what is going on in the current expansion.</div></div><hr />
