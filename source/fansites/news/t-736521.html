Trainers<br />
Class and Profession trainers have a new interface, I'm not really sure it's more useful than the old one but it's nicer.<br />
<br />

Next wave of Beta invitations<br />
We hope to distribute additional invites to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta sometime this week, possibly as soon as late Tuesday or Wednesday. This is only an estimate, though, so the schedule may change and, as a result, invites could be distributed earlier or later than anticipated. Either way, we'll work to keep you as updated as possible. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968569181/when-is-next-beta-wave-comming/))<br />
<br />
World changes in Cataclysm - &quot;Old&quot; zones lost forever<br />
If there's one lesson I've been struggling with a lot recently, it's that rejecting the nature of change can be damaging. Granted, the trials to which I'm referring aren't related to video games, though they still apply universally. Sure, places will change, new questlines will replace many old ones, and Azeroth will never look quite the same again. There are, however, new places of beauty, new adventures to be had, and new struggles to overcome in the wake of change. A brand new player joining us in Cataclysm won't know quite what it was like to level prior to Deathwing's return, but they'll get to experience all of the new wonders of the world, not to mention a design that's become more definitive and polished over the years.<br />
<br />
[...] Trust me, I understand the sentiment. We have no current plans though for preserving elsewhere the areas being changed. The story is evolving. To complement this, so is Azeroth as we know it. For current players, there will still be a good sense of familiarity in so many places within the old world. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968669337/permanent-changes-to-azeroth-in-cataclysm/))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Block Chance<br />
Your block chance won't be 5%. That's too low. It will probably be something like 30%, but we haven't figured out yet where to provide that 30%. It is likely to be a warrior / paladin only thing or even a Prot / Prot passive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820149/protection-warrior/))<br />
<br />
Max out the Mastery Bonus<br />
Furthermore, there should be no way to max out mastery. It's only just possible to max out things like crit and haste today because of A) overly generous talents, and B) ratings that were never designed for current item levels. We've already built the theoretical Deathwing gear, so we can make sure the numbers are more appropriate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820149/protection-warrior/))<br />
<br />
Hybrid/Multi-Tree Specs<br />
Whenever a popular hybrid spec comes up, it's usually because of some sneaky build that is broken for PvP by snaking down to pick up key talents in two trees. It's not because the player really wants to play as say two specs -- they are just cherry picking the talents. Since those builds almost always feel broken (as in breaking the rules) we don't want to design around them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969019580/question-clarification-on-new-31-talents/))<br />
<br />
Abilities in new Talent Trees<br />
They aren't all abilities. Most of the trees have say 4 or so active abilities in addition to the one at level 10. This is pretty consistent with live (an 11, 21, 31, 41 and 51 &quot;clicky&quot; ability).<br />
<br />
The first couple of tiers have mostly simple talents. This is because you just don't have a lot of abilities at level 10, rotations are simple, stuff tends to die fast, and we don't want to overwhelm new players (including experienced players trying a new class). We also have to provide a lot of sub-spec potential in these trees.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, things start to get more interesting and you see the talents that do procs or mechanic changes. There are more 1 point talents now, typically those that give raid buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969019580/question-clarification-on-new-31-talents/))<br />
<br />
GCD Locked<br />
We consider being GCD locked a bad thing. It doesn't give you any room in your rotation to say click a potion or respond to a proc or do something out of the ordinary. It leads to tunnel vision. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br />

Regrowth<br />
We want Regrowth to feel like the flash heal. It will need to change a little to fit in that model (more up front and less hot perhaps) but it doesn't also need to feel exactly like Flash Heal to do the job. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969519290/a-question-about-regrowth/))<br />

Holy Paladins in Cataclysm<br />
Holy paladins are changing in Cataclysm probably more than you realize. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968748033/changes-in-cata-and-tank-damage-for-pally/))<br />

Mortal Strike as Fury/Protection<br />
Correct. It is impossible for Fury or Protection to ever have Mortal Strike. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969019580/question-clarification-on-new-31-talents/))<br />
<br />
Dual-Wield<br />
Only Fury warriors will dual-wield in Cataclysm. The Arms tree is completely built around using a two-handed weapon and the Prot tree is completely built around using a shield. There is no reason to dual-wield in those trees. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399740676/please-streamline-the-warrior-trees/))<br />
<br />
Critical Block<br />
We haven't done much with Critical Block as mastery yet because the level cap on the beta is so low and raid content isn't available to publicly test yet. As we get closer we'll put some better numbers on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br />

Yes you can (among other things), if hunters keep the tracking system: OMG MINIMAP SPAM. I wonder how they'll handle that.<br />

I'm guessing you probably won't see any of the spec specific spells in your spell book until you get to 10 and choose a spec. Then it shows you all the spells you can get for that sepc.</div></div><hr />

He will see all spells that are none-talent-tree restricted, so if he chose arms, shield block and last stand would be grey'd out. Assuming those are still learned IN the prot talent tree.</div></div><hr />

Friend has a hunter on the beta. Yes, hunters can track everything at once. The damage buff doesn't stack, if that's what your getting at. You don't get +5% for dragonkin, plus an additional 5% for tracking beasts if you are also tracking beasts. You just get 5% because you're tracking.</div></div><hr />

I think regrowth should be the &quot;fast heal&quot; and nourish the &quot;heal&quot; equivalent for druids. If yes than it's a little bit odd, because regrowth is all but not &quot;fast&quot; in the moment, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can minimize stat windows.. so if you are a mage, you probably don't want to see melee stats - close it, nor do you want to see ranged statsa - close it. Cuz I think you can show spell stats + base stats + defense~ without scrolling.</div></div><hr />

If yes than it's a little bit odd, because regrowth is all but not &quot;fast&quot; in the moment, isn't it?<br />
<br />
my regrowth isnt all that slow , with ng proc its on a 1.1s cast vs 0.9 for nourish - its the mana cost which hurts since its 29% of base mana vs 18% for nourish thats 5 nourish mana wise for 3 regrowth and fully talented and glyphed then nourish is `flashing` for alot more</div></div><hr />

<br />
IE, a level 1 Warrior will see all spells, but at level 10 the Warrior specs Arms...<br />
<br />
1) Will he still see all the Warrior spells?<br />
2) Will he just see generic Warrior (all specs) spells?<br />
3) Will the Fury / Prot Spells &quot;disappear&quot;? <br />
or<br />
4) Will the Arms spells just &quot;appear&quot;, (and be grey where required)?<br />
If talented abilities are even in the spell book (until you talent them of course....), they will be greyed out not with the remark &quot;Available at level x&quot; but with remark &quot;Available to fury specilization&quot; or something. At that's how I hope it will be. :P Nobody knows because the new talent system isn't in a public build yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you even realize why the change was made? Now they can give the specs unique abilities with just one talent point, which is great ! And they don't need to put active abilities so down the tree just to make sure other specs can't have them.<br />
<br />
Now its the way it should always have been. Having 71 talentpoints forced the active abilities even lower down the trees, and they just had to fill the gap with crap talents.<br />
<br />
And now abilities can be balanced better, no need to worry &quot;what if an arms warrior gets this fury talent with this arms talent, it becomes op&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Love the UI changes !</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree. If your going to be forced to be say a Ret pala, then you should do just as much dps as a mage/lock/hunter/rogue. It should help them to balance things abit more by locking people into 1 tree essentially.</div></div><hr />

Yes you can (among other things), if hunters keep the tracking system: OMG MINIMAP SPAM. I wonder how they'll handle that.<br />
Just a little FYI, bots don't need the minimap. They already know where the mine is when it's loaded.<br />

Hunters will probably still only track one type of enemy at the time, but yeah, it's still going to get crowded. Might be that they change the node dots to icons representing herbs/deposits, though.</div></div><hr />

You are correct. But wouldn't it be great if, right after beating Deathwing, a voice echoed through the room, a door opened and you had to kill yet another Old God? Ofc, to have an impact, this would have to be hidden until live... But, damn, that would feel epic!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it is possible they could have every spell under one tab until level 10, as you don't usually have too much till then, but I don't think they'll do that.<br />
<br />
Why not just keep it like now? The only spells that are affected is the three talents that are exclusive to the trees. Choosing your spec doesn't block you out of every non-spec skill. Just the one that's exclusive to the other tree. After choosing Fury, you'd still be able to use Hamstring.</div></div><hr />

You're the troll if you're trying to peg Hallion as the last boss of WotLK. Lore-wise, it's a battle leading up to the events that trigger Cataclysm. Has nothing to do with WotLK.<br />

Blizzard does keep tabs on addons and sometimes some of them are incorporated into the UI. The advantage of it being in the UI is that it won't randomly break and come up with a huge message on screen and it won't consume memory like addons do</div></div><hr />

You CAN NOT currently filter by skill level... i.e. bring all orange recipes/plans to the top, followed by yellow, followed by green, followed by everything else, regardless of the sub-group it falls in.

<br />
They better not fuck up Regrowth, as it is its a perfect expression of Druid healing, and with Nourish and Regrowth becoming Flash Heals seems kind of Redundant...With the way the two works I think the basic idea is that Regrowth is your flash heal on most of the raid, while Nourish would be your flash heal on tanks.

I agree to an extent. Those &quot;special snowflake&quot; builds were usually terrible and thus wasted the time of everyone else involved because they were simply less effective 92% of the time. However, occasionally they were nice, and I would like to see not only different builds with similar effectiveness (real choices to make depending on playstyle that might be less effective at something but better at something else while still being viable), and that &quot;hybrid=less dps&quot; mentality stamped out also as a result. Most of the &quot;pure&quot; classes seem to be getting plenty of options now, it's an outdated concept that needs to die. If you invite two classes to dps and they are both raid buffing in similar ways there should be no additional behind-the-scenes discrepency holding a hybrid back &quot;just because&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love how like 99% of these additions to the default UI are addons already. lol<br />
<br />
I always considered addons that Blizzard allowed to be what Blizzard either wanted to impliment at some point but couldn't/wouldn't at the time, or something they thought was a good idea but didn't think of themselves. I dream of a day where I can effectively raid heal like I can right now, but without any addons. I may never see that day but it'd be nice to free up some of that space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude you need to get your head out of your ass. Forcing people to go 31 points into a tree may be a little &quot;restricting&quot; however it will make it a whole lot easier for blizzard to balance specs making for more balanced game play. If your class currently relies on a cookie cutter hybrid spec to do anything it will be fixed and talents will be allotted to specific specs to make them viable for the role blizz wants them to play. I'd much rather have balance than the option for some people to feel like special little butterflies.</div></div><hr />

So you're saying BC ended with Black Temple? And that all the Burning Legion/Kael'thas/Kil'Jaeden lore in Sunwell Plateau was leading up to Arthas, The Scourge, and WotLK on a whole? Furthermore, you're counter to the Halion argument is that it's TBC equivalent is Zul'Aman?<br />
<br />
Now I can agree Halion is not WotLK content but... wow... the Zul'jin argument is just awful considering he was followed by 2.4. Simply put, Illidan was pegged as the main antagonist of BC and he was NOT. Arthas most certainly did carry through to the very end but that was clearly not the case with BC. And it might not be the case with Deathwing either... just saying.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why it's so hard for Blizzard to: Release content/info in a timely manner, change their &quot;maint day&quot; downtime to 2pst here in the states considering for almost three months straight maint had to be extended. And to live up to their promises, you know, the major advertising bulletpoint: &quot;New Dances&quot;.<br />

I want my new dances already. Seriously, I don't know why they overlook animations of character models so much. Freshening them up could make the game feel new.

Jil'jaeden is clearly the last boss of TBC. It may not have been the final boss Blizzard had intended but they ALTERED the storyline and let it evolve fluidly to end with Kael'thas and Kil'jaeden. Nothing WotLK related began until the Scourge Invasion event and Zombie Epidemic.<br />
<br />
IF Illidan was the last boss of The Burning Crusade, thus meaning The Burning Crusade expansion ended in 2.1, then the Burning Crusade was easily the worst expansion. In fact, it was a pile of steaming, disappointing crap. <br />
<br />
January 16h, 2007 (TBS release) to May 22, 2007 (Patch 2.1). The expansion was five months then. And the &quot;final/main&quot; boss, Illidan, did absolutely nothing of substantial value, had zero character interaction outside of his raid and a tiny Netherwing appearamce, only controlled the Illidari demons, and essentually sat in his temple for 5 months waiting for Maiev and Akama to come get revenge.<br />
<br />
Nope. Don't buy it. Blizz made him the villain, screwed up cause they released him too soon, so altered the storyline and PROPERLY ended the expansion with Kil'jaeden.</div></div><hr />

It all depends on the faith you have in Blizz's ability to deliver on promises. Sure what they sounds promising and reasonable but some ppl don't beleive that they will (or even can) deliver on their promisses. They always wanted to allow for meaningfull decissions in the talent trees (including in vanila when they had the same amount of points), but somehow they have never managed to create real options that do not gimp the player. Say mages; in vanila cookycutter frost spec through BWL, replaced by another cookiecutter speck when fire-resist goes away... same generall issue they have today.</div></div><hr />

It's not because the player really wants to play as say two specs -- they are just cherry picking the talents. Since those builds almost always feel broken (as in breaking the rules) we don't want to design around them.&quot;<br />
<br />
He still doesn't get it, does he? I personally never hybrid specced because it was the cookie cutter build. I hybrid specced because I looked at my talents and thought, &quot;Hmm, this tree needs some mana regen, oh! How about I put a few points into Disc to get Meditation?&quot; Moreso, this is / was a fun and interesting way to work around the system and customize my character. It felt like I was choosing &quot;my spec&quot;, rather than &quot;holy spec&quot;. A good way to say it is that when they do this and remove hybrid specs, they're losing the sandbox feel that was key to making WoW talents interesting.</div></div><hr />

Character &amp; Talent tree: Yay!<br />
<br />
Tracking: Really hoping this goes live, as I am tired of flying over herbs while fishing.<br />
<br />
Class &amp; Profession Trainers: Sorry, they don't look &quot;nicer&quot;; I prefer compactness.<br />
<br />
PvP: Haven't seriously played PvP since TBC, so no opinion here.<br />
<br />
Profession filters: I'm keeping my fingers crossed here that this doesn't live without some changes because judging from the preview alone, it looks too bloated (aka taking up too much space).<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, is anyone else scratching their heads over the blue post regarding Regrowth? It sounds a bit circular to me. :/<br />
<br />
All I know is that I love your icon...FFT is my favorite game of all time, and that artist is so unique!<br />

<br />
So Zul'jin was a prequal to WoTLK?<br />
<br />
Yeah... didn't think so.<br />
<br />
It is still entirely possible for there to be another LORE boss AFTER Deathwing (just like Kil'Jaeden after Illidan).<br />
<br />
Zul'jin was not the prequel to WotLK, but it certainly had absolutely nothing to do with BC lore itself. It was a stand-alone &quot;filler&quot; as you put it.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you guys are thick.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe I've seen any shaman posts recently. It makes me feel sad because I really want to know how Blizzard specifically is going to deal with mana for enhancement, but one could suppose that no news is good news...</div></div><hr />

Can anyone in beta indeed confirm that herb and mining tracking works at the same time ?<br />

All I see is the other tracking in the pic (banks/trainers/crap/etc.) <br />

I'd like to be sure before I drop a fullly levelled profession and spend hours picking herbs :))<br />
