Mists of Pandaria FAQ<br />
<br />
Q: What is the story of World of Warcraft®: Mists of Pandaria™? <br />
<br />
Alliance warships prowl the seas. Horde armies thunder across Kalimdor. Tensions between these factions edge closer to erupting in a savage war that threatens to consume all of Azeroth. Against this backdrop of impending conflict, an uncharted island mysteriously appears....<br />
Shrouded in fog since the world was sundered more than ten thousand years ago, the ancient realm of Pandaria has remained unspoiled by war. Its lush forests and cloud-ringed mountains are home to a complex ecosystem of indigenous races and exotic creatures -- including the enigmatic pandaren.<br />
All but the bravest pandaren explorers have been hidden from the world for thousands of years. Now, in the aftermath of the events of World of Warcraft®: Cataclysm™, Pandaria's heroes are stepping forward to declare their allegiance to either the Alliance or the Horde and share the extraordinary secrets of their ancient martial arts with the world.<br />
Q: Who are the pandaren? <br />
<br />
The pandaren are an enigmatic race native to the long-hidden continent of Pandaria. Honorable and filled with a love of good company, good food -- and every now and then, a good friendly brawl -- the pandaren have been content to live in seclusion, allowing their culture to flourish and thrive away from the influence of the outside world. However, every now and then, a pandaren is born with a thirst for adventure that rivals his or her thirst for a strong drink, and he or she strikes out to explore beyond Pandaria’s shores. One of the most famous such wanderers was the brewmaster Chen Stormstout, who set out to look for exotic ingredients for a special ale and wound up assisting the Horde during the events of Warcraft® III: The Frozen Throne®.<br />
<br />
While the pandaren are predominantly a peace-loving race, their history is marked with turmoil and strife. After years of living under the oppressive rule of the cruel mogu, who banned the use of weapons as a means of control, the pandaren developed the martial arts that would become the hallmark of their monk caste and used their skills to free themselves from the mogu rule. Terrifying natural forces and strange indigenous enemies -- such as the voracious mantid, who emerge every few years to consume everything in their path -- have also had a hand in shaping pandaren culture over the centuries. Now, the pandaren way of life faces its biggest trial yet, as Horde and Alliance forces make landfall on Pandaria’s pristine shores....<br />
<br />
Q: What are the features of World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria?<br />
<br />
Some of the new features of World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria include:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Playable Race -- Pandaren: Adventure through Azeroth as World of Warcraft's first neutral race and decide whether to side with the Alliance or the Horde. <br />
New Playable Class -- Monk: Unlock the secrets of pandaren martial arts and do battle as a damage dealer, healer, or tank.<br />
Level Cap Increased to 90: Learn potent new spells and abilities while exploring uncharted zones and taking on challenging new content.<br />
New Zones: Explore the lush Jade Forest, treacherous Kun-Lai Summit, and other exotic areas of Pandaria designed for high-level characters, and uncover the mystery of the Wandering Isle.<br />
Scenarios: Join up with some friends to achieve a common goal, such as mounting a defense against invading monsters, in a flexible new type of PvE challenge.<br />
Dungeon “Challenge” Modes: Master the ultimate 5-player time trial and earn prestige rewards in a new dungeon mode that will put your resolve and coordination to the test.<br />
Pet Battles: Challenge other players’ companion pets with your own collection in a new tactical mini-game, and find out who's king or queen of the pint-sized battlefield.<br />
New Talent System: Customize your character to suit your play style with the newly overhauled and improved talent system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How are the pandaren a “neutral” race? At what point do you choose which faction to side with?<br />
<br />
Pandaren who strike out to explore the world outside their homeland begin their journey on the Wandering Isle (a new starting zone for pandaren characters level 1 to 10), where they face a number of trials -- and meet with a number of characters from both the Alliance and the Horde -- before arriving in Kalimdor or the Eastern Kingdoms. Pandaren remain neutral through most of their Wandering Isle quests, but before they leave, players will need to make a decision whether to permanently side with the Alliance or the Horde. After that decision is made, the character will be treated just like any other member of their chosen faction in cities, on quests, and in character interactions. Choose wisely, because once your decision is made, it’s irreversible (except through the Faction Change service).<br />
<br />
Q: What is the monk class? How does it differ from other classes in the game?<br />
<br />
The monk is a martial arts expert who excels in close-quarters hand-to-hand combat, and can fill the role of a tank, damage-dealer, or healer, depending on a player’s chosen specialization. As with most classes in the game (with the exception of death knights), monks begin their journey at level 1. <br />
<br />
Monks have a number of unique mechanics and resources that set them apart from other classes. For example, the class is being designed with a more active approach to combat than other classes; every kick and punch is performed with the press of a key, so they will not have a default auto-attack. In addition, monks build up “chi” through a combination of punches, kicks, and other basic martial arts moves, and then expend it to unleash powerful special moves, such as finishers or potent heals. <br />
<br />
Q: Which races can be a monk?<br />
<br />
Since coming into contact with members of the Horde and the Alliance, several of Pandaria’s masters have begun to teach their new allies the secrets of their ancient martial arts. Currently, every race except goblin and worgen can learn the ways of the monk.<br />
<br />
Q: Which classes are available to a pandaren?<br />
<br />
Currently, pandaren can choose to be hunters, mages, priests, rogues, shaman, warriors, and -- of course -- monks. Pandaren are not able to become death knights, druids, paladins, or warlocks.<br />
<br />
Q: What end-game content will be available for players at level 90?<br />
<br />
With World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, our focus was on rebuilding the old world and improving the level 1 to 60 experience for players -- and as a result, we didn’t end up creating a lot of new types of content for players to tackle once they had reached max level. One of our primary design goals for Mists of Pandaria is to give players a wider variety of content and different types of gameplay to enjoy once they reach level 90, in addition to the Heroic dungeons, raids, and daily quests that they’re used to. To that end, we are introducing three major new features in the new expansion: scenarios, challenge modes for 5-player dungeons, and companion pet battles.<br />
<br />
Q: What are Scenarios?<br />
<br />
Scenarios are a new type of PvE challenge designed for groups of as few as 3 or as many as 25 players, depending on what is appropriate for the content. Scenarios require players to band together to complete a specific goal, such as defending Goldshire against a gnoll attack or storming a beach near a Horde fortification. Each scenario will have its own set of unique objectives, and in general they will offer a different type of gameplay from the trash-and-boss design of 5-player dungeons.<br />
<br />
Scenarios will allow for more flexible group compositions than dungeons do, so parties won’t necessarily need a specific number of tanks, healers, or damage-dealers (though exactly what’s required will vary by scenario). And while a scenario may take place in a familiar location within the game world, each scenario will be instanced. In general, expect a scenario to take anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes to complete. <br />
<br />
Q: What are Challenge Modes for 5-player dungeons?<br />
<br />
Challenge mode is a new, advanced mode for 5-player dungeons designed for players looking for the ultimate test of coordination and skill. In challenge modes, players are tasked with trying to complete an existing 5-player dungeon as quickly and skillfully as possible. Depending on how well the group does, players will receive recognizable prestige rewards such as mounts, pets, titles, achievements, or special armor artwork that can be used with transmogrification to customize a character’s appearance. The inspiration for challenge modes comes from events such as the 45-minute Baron Rivendare runs in the original Stratholme dungeon, or the timed Zul’Aman dungeon run for the Amani War Bear.<br />
<br />
We want challenge modes to be a test of player skill and not of player gear, and so the stats on all players’ armor and equipment will be normalized to a set level upon beginning a challenge. As a result, players will have the same chance at victory whether they are wearing quest rewards or Heroic-raid-level epic items. Regardless of equipment, challenge modes will remain just as challenging at the end of the expansion as they were at the beginning.<br />
<br />
Q: What are companion pet battles?<br />
<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, we are adding a new tactical mini-game that will give the Snowshoe Rabbits, Mechanical Squirrels, and other cute lil’ companion pets players collect something to do other than stand around looking adorable.<br />
<br />
Companion pet battles allow players to pit their pint-sized pals against other players’ pets (or against special critters you come across in the wild) in strategic, turn-based combat. Pets will level up as they earn combat experience, and each companion in the game will have its own set of stats – such as attack and defense rating – along with unique abilities with their own tactical merits. During a pet battle, players will be able to swap companions out strategically depending on which pet they’re facing or what abilities might come in handy against a given foe.<br />
<br />
Pet battles are meant to be completely independent from your character’s main progression, and the rewards won’t offer additional advantages in regular PvP or PvE situations such as Battlegrounds or raids -- though they should help pass the time while you’re waiting for your group to recoup from a particularly nasty wipe.<br />
<br />
Q: Are any changes in store for dungeons and raids?<br />
<br />
As with the upcoming patch 4.3, Mists of Pandaria will include a third difficulty level for raids. Expect one difficulty to be roughly equivalent to the current normal mode, one to be about on par with the current Heroic mode, and one to be much more pick-up-group-friendly. Our goal is to allow more players to be able to experience the content -- especially the climactic boss encounters that are a part of each expansion’s story arc -- while still satisfying players looking for the most epic challenges and rewards.<br />
<br />
Q: What’s in store for professions?<br />
<br />
While we don’t plan to add any brand-new professions in Mists of Pandaria, the profession skill cap will be extended, and new recipes and content will become available for every existing profession.<br />
<br />
Q: What are the new zones?<br />
<br />
The continent of Pandaria will consist of five enormous zones for players level 85 and above, and new pandaren players will begin their adventures in a unique starting zone separate from the pandaren homeland. Here’s the breakdown of the zones, along with their current working names:<br />
<br />
The Jade Forest: High-level adventurers will make landfall in the lush Jade Forest, where they’ll meet some of Pandaria’s indigenous races, such as the fish-like jinyu and monkey-like hozu.<br />
Valley of the Four Winds: Playing home to both farms and rainforests, the Valley of the Four Winds is also where travelers will find the legendary Stormstout Brewery.<br />
Kun-Lai Summit: Amid this treacherous mountain terrain, players will encounter the Shadowpan, a clandestine sect charged with keeping one of Pandaria’s darkest secrets.<br />
Townlong Steppes: Here, a tremendous wall separates Pandaria’s verdant forests and plains from the desolate wasteland left in the wake of the ravenous, all-consuming mantid.<br />
Vale of Eternal Blossoms: Adventurers from either faction are welcome to share a drink in the central city of the pandaren. This zone also hosts many daily quests for max-level characters.<br />
The Wandering Isle: Pandaren adventurers looking to explore the world outside Pandaria begin their journey here, on a mysterious island that never seems to settle in the same place for too long.<br />
<br />
Q: What changes are being made to the talent system?<br />
<br />
We are making a couple of major changes to how class specializations and talents work in Mists of Pandaria. First, your specialization is now completely independent from your talent choices. When you reach level 10, you will still choose one of three specs (e.g. Discipline, Holy, or Shadow priest) to determine your role, play style, and which signature abilities your character has access to. In addition, you’ll receive more of your spec’s defining abilities as you level up. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the talent system has been redesigned completely. At regular level intervals (at level 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90), players will now be able to choose between one of three very powerful talents. All three specializations will have access to the same three talent options, and our goal is to make sure that these talent choices are appealing to all three specializations with no obvious “must-have” options for any of them. For example, level-15 warriors will be able to choose one of three movement-related talents: Juggernaut, which permanently lowers the cooldown of Charge; Double Time, which lets the warrior Charge twice before incurring a cooldown; or Warbringer, which causes the target to be rooted in place following a Charge. Once you choose a talent in a specific tier, the other two talents are locked out from your talent build, even when you reach the next talent tier. We want players to be able to change their talent build independently of their specialization, and without visiting a class trainer. This new system is designed to provide players with hundreds of distinct and meaningful options for tailoring their character’s gameplay to their specific desires and situation.<br />
<br />
Q: Why is the talent system going through an overhaul?<br />
<br />
As with the talent-system redesign in Cataclysm, our goal is ultimately to give players more meaningful character-customization options and to eliminate “cookie-cutter” talent builds. We were only partially successful in realizing that goal in Cataclysm, as many talents still felt mandatory to a given specialization, and some talent choices in the trees were still not particularly interesting or exciting. By giving the benefits of the previously “mandatory” talents to players automatically as part of their specialization choice, and allowing any specialization to choose any given talent, we hope to be able to give players much more significant and interesting decisions to make about their character.<br />
<br />
Q: Will you be making any changes to how stats work?<br />
<br />
Yes. As World of Warcraft has matured and more expansions, content updates, and tiers of equipment have been released, players’ stats have begun to inflate exponentially. At this point, the numbers for health, mana, and so on are threatening to get out of control. In order to combat this and bring statistics back to earth -- or Azeroth, as it were -- in Mists of Pandaria, we will be “flattening” the statistic curve in places where it no longer needs to behave exponentially (primarily at the point of the end game for old expansions). In practice, this means that upon the expansion’s release, the numbers for Strength, Health, Intellect, damage, and so on will be significantly lower than you’re used to seeing across the board, from level 1 to level 85. It’s all relative, of course -- enemies’ and bosses’ stats will be reduced as well, and it should take a level-85 warrior roughly the same number of many sword-whacks and ability uses to kill a level-85 monster as it did before. However, this also means the difference between each level between 1 and 85 will be less significant, so you may find that an enemy 5 or 10 levels below your own will be a little tougher to deal with than it was before. <br />
<br />
Q: Will players be allowed to fly in Pandaria?<br />
<br />
Upon arrival in Pandaria, players will be restricted from flying until they reach a certain point in their quest progression. While the ability to fly is a great convenience for players once they have completed content, we can provide a much more enjoyable, rewarding, and varied questing experience if players are (mostly) grounded while the story of Pandaria unfolds.<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be any updates to the graphics and changes to the minimum system requirements?<br />
<br />
Yes, there will be incremental tweaks and updates to the graphics engine in this expansion. For example, we’ve made improvements to the way textures are displayed. We’ll announce the exact system requirements closer to the expansion’s release.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">good diu bro</div><div class="date">2011-10-22, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: Which races can be a monk?<br />
<br />
Since coming into contact with members of the Horde and the Alliance, several of Pandaria’s masters have begun to teach their new allies the secrets of their ancient martial arts. Currently, every race except goblin and worgen can learn the ways of the monk/ <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What is the monk class? How does it differ from other classes in the game?<br />
<br />
The monk is a martial arts expert who excels in close-quarters hand-to-hand combat, and can fill the role of a tank, damage-dealer, or healer, depending on a player’s chosen specialization. As with most classes in the game (with the exception of death knights), monks begin their journey at level 1. <br />
<br />
Monks have a number of unique mechanics and resources that set them apart from other classes. For example, the class is being designed with a more active approach to combat than other classes; every kick and punch is performed with the press of a key, so they will not have a default auto-attack. In addition, monks build up “chi” through a combination of punches, kicks, and other basic martial arts moves, and then expend it to unleash powerful special moves, such as finishers or potent heals. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, we have to have a definition for what is a monk first...<br />
What exactly is a &quot;monk&quot; anyway?<br />
Obviously it wont be the religious zealot type we are talking about.<br />
But if we are talking about those master of fistweapon, then why goblins and worgen (who definitely are alcoholic) cannot deliver heavy blows while those squishy gnomes and undead(how can they even get drunk?) can?</div></div><hr />

Yeah I understand but what does this mean exactly. Like are the numbers like 180k HP or what not gone. These are obviously the numbers we were given in Cataclysm and all im asking is say for example...back in Wrath of the Lich King we had averagely 32k HP, is that what they are aiming for in MoP? Cause if so, that would be great and if not then its just Meh. <br />
<br />
I think my question is a bit weird to understand but I appreciate anyone who gives me an answer but thanks Marksman for your post.</div></div><hr />

Numbers are FINALLY being toned down. The game will be toned down with it though, so even though we won't see inflated numbers (180k HP pools, etc) nothing important will drastically change.We'll say a boss currently has 100k HP. Each hit, you currently do 1k per hit. In MoP, that boss will have, say, 50k HP, and you'll do 500 per hit. Basically, all the percentages are the same, just the numbers have changed.

<br />
Or maybe it's that you're dense and can't understand what they're upset about. They're tearing apart the trees again, for better, or for far far worse we have yet to see. This is going to completely and utterly destroy class/spec balancing, period, in PVE and especially PVP. There's only 5 levels of progression, again. 1 new race. 1 new class. We should be getting more of everything as we go forward, instead it's about consolation prizes. If I wanted to play pokemon, I'd buy a DS.

<br />
And don't forget this is blizzard, as in we probably won't get all those &quot;cool features&quot;. Nor will we see them down the line as we know since blizzard has made numerous empty promises that were to this date never filled.<br />
<br />
Blizzard at this point of time knows the writing is on the wall though for WoW, thus they're trying to milk it's rabid userbase that's left for all they're worth. They know that these people will buy any snake oil they sell. But, those people that were on the fence, and especially veterans that they've lost in the millions now, they for the most part will not be back, and the game is further progressing away from what they liked, and the game is just out-classed and out-dated now totally.<br />
<br />

<br />
If they'd made level cap 95 and redistributed the xp gains/numbers would you be happier? This is really dumb. The amount of zones and the size of them matches the other expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 new race. 1 new class. We should be getting more of everything as we go forward, instead it's about consolation prizes.<br />

Why? And you say messing talents trees will disturb balance - surely adding more entirely new classes/racials would be worse?<br />

I mean look at it...it looks awesome ! When I look at the old vanilla screenshots, it really looks like a different game, in a positive way. <br />
By the way, as an ex-wow-gamer I always think of playing again, but as the game progresses and changes the urge dimishes, which is also good. (for me) ^^ <br />
The one thing I dont like is the shared pandaren race. You cannot be horde AND alliance, especially not if the story is all gonna be about the war between the factions. <br />
Ogres would have been nice monks I think. They are as fat and bouncy as the pandas are and I'm still waiting for them to return to the horde....oh well. Most other stuff sounds awesome...<br />
<br />
<br />
viewable 1:1 sized dungeons <br />
no definete evil, which I think is refreshing after all the world killer enemies. <br />
new talent system <br />
no flying until you're at max level in the new zones (flying makes the game boring...a bit) <br />
Pet Wars ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard really seems to improve wherever it's possible, but often it's just a nasty community talking it bad. For me, I will go with Diablo 3, just because it allows me a more flexible time management, instead of setting times for when I have to be home for raiding and stuff.<br />
<br />
There was a legend about a legendary warrior, who's skills were the stuff of legends....and he played a pandaren Deathknight ! *LOL<br />
As I know Blizzards there are gonna be A LOT of Kung Fu POanda and other Kung Fu Ester Eggs in this ^^.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget to close the door behind you, lock it and throw away your keys!!! (and the spare keys).<br />
Great looks, Monks, new challenges, new times, pet battles etc etc etc...<br />
<br />
Yeah, gimmie that, all sounds fun.<br />
<br />
I never had a high tolerance for people bitching about stuff in a fantasy game.. <br />
It's alright to go walking around as a giant cow/troll/orc/space goat, ride around on bikes/choppers/trikes, fly in helicopters/rockets, on dragons (or even transform into one), transform into other forms for that matter, fight dragons/squids/tentacle beast/undeads/demons/big bad races and the list goes on and on and on.... and suddenly a pandaren appears and the world is coming to an end?<br />
<br />
Crawl back into the hole you came out, please leave this game and go play something else and leave wow to the other millions of people that actually do like the game and the direction it is going in.</div></div><hr />

I guess there has always been changes for each expansion as we saw with cataclysm but I somehow just feel like this is bigger! <br />
<br />
And to the ones saying &quot;it's just like kung-fu panda&quot; well maybe it seems like that? But panda's are part of the wow lore... so... &gt;[ &quot;] <br />
<br />
Anyway I'm excited!! And as a hunter oh MY am I happy that we FINALLY can hug everyone elses face when we want to YIPEEEEEE!! <br />
And I like the fact that we will only be using ranged-weapons, finally others can't yoink our bows ^^ I generally think the new talent tree system looks quite positive and I'm looking forward to trying out the beta! - Good job with the updates in here btw :D</div></div><hr />

I think you can choose between three skills every 15 levels.<br />
Or that's what it looks like NOW.<br />

If you raid/Arena/Hardcore PvP than you only really have 1 option to min/max your spec per talent tier.<br />
<br />
No Not really, those new talents are more like a glyph that you WILL have to change to suit each fight. There will always be a cookie cutter, yes but this new talent is actually harder to decide than what we have now. They are all the same kinda of ability with a slightly different while the talent now that we have has a clear choice which one should we choose since they are all different. <br />
<br />
The new talent has less choice but you will really have to choose wisely to suit the situation while the old talent has more choice but you really dont have to think at all. Which one is better? Just more no brainer choice? or more thinking?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm really looking forward to the new xpac in every aspect except the pet battle system (but I'll give it a shot atleast becuase im not going to think of something as complete shit when I havent even tried it), and I couldn't help but notice your hate with it &quot;And now you get to be Michael Vick and make your little pets fight.&quot; I'm not going to lie as much as I hate people bashing something they haven't tried yet, that quote was hilarious, prob the only bashing that I would get a laugh out of. <br />
<br />
Other then that people shouldn't judge a book by its cover aka a 2 min video displaying mostly zones only and unfinished alpha models and animations that'll go through updates and tweaks for the next 5-6+ months (Worgen changes, especially female worgen for example). Dont play a pandaren if you hate them so much (you'll be able to kill them if you get any satisfaction out of that lol) and look at the other new added aspects to the upcoming expansion.<br />
<br />
-3 new bgs with all new aspects, DOTA style bg for example, new arena. <br />
<br />
-Completely revamped talent system which seems like its going to bring more variety and customization considering theres going to be tough decision making to go with your playstyle, and besides if blizzard continued to add a new OP talent every xpac, shit would just get even more imbalanced. Now you have to decide between useful skills *Choosing between deathcoil or howl of terror as a lock for example*.<br />
<br />
-New *hopefully* challenging timed runs which I hope are rewarding, <br />
<br />
-New monk class that gives you the option to be any race except worgen/goblin *Just think, gnome monk or any other available race with transmoged cursed vision of Sarg//Hyjal claws as weps ect.. so glad there going to be using leather as the main equipment* also with a completely new healing playstyle consisting of melee abilities most likely, and who knows how cool brewmaster tank spec/windwalking dps spec is going to work, cant wait. <br />
<br />
-Other then that there bringing back outdoor bosses which hopefully brings back that nightmare dragon/kazzak/azurgoes feel back to the game between alliance/horde ooutdoor pvp/griefing as well as there being no main baddie which worked great for vanilla WoW, hopefully this will build up a new story that leads us to something big the xpac after *not saying MoP isnt going to be big on story*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and considering how pretty few people even know about pandaran (except people that come here and have a good understanding of the game), I mean they were what? a neutral hero in WC3, no real lore to them.<br />
<br />
And now people are going to know everything about the Pandaren race with this expansion. You sound like a racist to me and this goes for every other racist who cried &quot;OMG, Asian architecture in my WOW, no way, screw that.&quot; How is having a Panda race any sillier than those Walruses out in Northrend? or all the countless silly things in the game.<br />

Yes a WHOLE expansion aimed at a notoriously Asian animal, with environments having a certain Asian architectural feel.<br />
<br />
I've been on a WoW break for about a year now, but i've always wanted to play a Pandaren Monk. So I might return to WoW, if SWTOR somehow manages to fail miserably (doubtful).</div></div><hr />

Nah, I think pandas just seem to be not badass enough for some people.<br />
They're fat, cute, fluffy, have no claws or theeth...they're almost like gnomes. ^^<br />
<br />
But that's no surprise, after all we always got badass races and classes, heck, even bloodelves were awesome before they somehow lost their bloody image.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-10-22, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the Asian theme. :D I do not like pandaren though, never did. Everytime I saw the brewmaster in WCIII I felt like chewing my elbow, too. However, I also hated goblins, always did, so I really did not like the idea of goblins as a playable race - and now that I've given it a shot, I must admit goblins as playable race is one of the best thing Blizzard did, because it's awesomely fun. So I'll just be Switzerland on the Pandaren topic. <br />
<br />
In the meanwhile, I'm loving the environments, but not so much excited about the announced content yet. Pet battles? Meh. I've got a solid team in Pokemon, thank you. Time runs? Really? Why not make it something a bit more exciting, with a specific, achievement-like goal? Or just give us more dungeons? :( But, yeah, I'm insisting on neutrality here. I'll give it a shot and see how it works out. I've never been a fan of monks, but I've been craving a new class, so bring it on. :cool:<br />
<br />
Edit: My dislike for panda's has nothing to do with too fluffy. I quite like their fluffyness, if anything that's just a plus for me. I just don't think Pandaren made much sense, or fit in WoW/Warcraft much. And I really hated the Brewmaster's voice too in WarcraftIII. :(</div></div><hr />

Although there's a lot of decent changes for this new addition, I don't see it being enough for me to return to the game. Cataclysm killed wow. Mists is trying valiantly to save it but it's saving it for the asian market not the US. Too little too late.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I am going to get a lot of stick from morons who have no concept &quot;OPINION&quot;. I just think they are way too silly, even though this has never been the most serious game in the world. The worst part is that it seems they are trying to do it with a straight face, which makes it even more hilarious (not in a good way).Apart from that though? I think the expac looks really, really good. The gameplay is what we are all here for, isnt it? The pandas are just a small part of it. If the gameplay is as good as before (in fact, it seems that its changing for the better), I'm certainly not going anywhere. I particularly like the talent changes and the fact that they are breaking up the routine of &quot;there is this big bad guy somewhere, fight him!&quot; and focusing on the alliance v horde war. I'm very interested in how they are going to implement the war in a pve scenario.Again, if you like the pandaren, it shouldn't bother you that I think they are by far in a way the worst addition to the game yet. It's my OPINION, and it shouldn't make you mad. If it does, you are a jerkoff. You see, that should make you mad.</div></div><hr />

It's how much alike Cata the expansion seems. Again, not in its theme, but the vibe I get from the product in itself. I see nothing of the depth and detail found in Outland and Northrend, where we indeed entered new, vibrant worlds. <br />
Instead I see a chunk of land which has been painted green, had some architecture thrown in, and labelled 'New continent - enjoy!'. <br />
<br />
For instance (pun intended), why are there only five new creatures (how can that few creatures make up for interesting fauna?), two of which are the theme of 2 out of the 3 raid dungeons present at release? I just don't see how that can be turned into something epic. It's like basing all the raid content in WotLK on the Oracles or Taunka. We know them pretty well now, but back then they meant nothing to us and so the raids were based on something more familiar. <br />
<br />
The presentation started really epic when someone declared they wanted to get people out of the cities and into the world, and I like some of the few ideas they had (apart from Pokemon, which I'll only use to get cash off the AH), but why didn't they do the obvious? Why didn't they remove, or alter, flying mounts in the old worlds? Why didn't they do more for open world PVP (again, some of their new features might solve that to a degree)? Why didn't we hear anything about a new profession, or a new way gathering or producing things that will bring you out in the world? <br />
<br />
So to sum up my incoherent rant, I guess what I'm getting at is that it feels like, to me, they haven't really revolutionised anything at all. They've taken the concept from Cataclysm, put the five zones together instead of scattering them across Azeroth, and changed one race for a class.</div></div><hr />

The only epxansion that allowed flying prematurely was Cata.

I never had a high tolerance for people bitching about stuff in a fantasy game.. <br />
It's alright to go walking around as a giant cow/troll/orc/space goat, ride around on bikes/choppers/trikes, fly in helicopters/rockets, on dragons (or even transform into one), transform into other forms for that matter, fight dragons/squids/tentacle beast/undeads/demons/big bad races and the list goes on and on and on.... and suddenly a pandaren appears and the world is coming to an end?<br />
<br />
Crawl back into the hole you came out, please leave this game and go play something else and leave wow to the other millions of people that actually do like the game and the direction it is going in.<br />
<br />
lol, plenty of people are taking the door out. That's why you end up with expansions like this. I love it, people are so angry that people are actually quitting WoW. Hell, I've managed to talk at least a few more people into quitting in the past week. Now you go ahead and get even more angry, your rawr at them for quitting the game you love. Your tears are so precious. lol<br />
<br />
No autoattack huh? Is that serious? Interesting, I seem to remember two mmos coming out soon with no auto attack, yet the very crowd that was QQing how horrible that was going to be is not here saying how wonderful this expansion will be.</div></div><hr />

Starting from level fifteen, you will getto choose one out of three talents that will be the same regardless of wich specc you chose. The three options will be kind of similar but still different.

Nobody cares what you'll do, just the way no one cares if I like expansion X or Y. Some people were very unhappy with the way things were in Vanilla. Some more people hated on most of Burning Crusade (Draenei anyone?) but now it's widely considered the best Xpac due to sentimental value. A lot more people hated Wotlk once it got going, oh God midway people were seriously pissed about the way loot was obtained. Then Cataclysm was announced people complained that they were basically getting robbed for buying the same content over again. Then they liked it, and now they are back to hating it. Skip to now, new Expansion is announced, Asian Themed, Pandaren included (The one race people have been asking for, for YEARS), and guess what, some people still hate it. You wanna know what I say to those &quot;people&quot;: GO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.</div></div><hr />

Not a theory obviously reality given the expansion. It's good business; tailor a game to your market. Losing one million subscribers woke Blizzard up. Now if only they actually put more money into the game with frequent content patches, they might retain more of their market share when SWTOR and other MMOs come out. They've done a good job in the past against Warhammer, LOTR, etc but things are getting tougher and they have to do better.<br />

I know its not the land or the pandarians we fight but what possible evil can be greater than the ones i mentioned before?I really thought the next expansion would be emerald dream or something and the last would possibly defeating Sargeras.This should either have been the first expansion or allready be a part of vanilla.Sounds more like a way to get more subscribers elsewhere like the east.The other parts of the expansion sounds exciting. Daring move with the specializations, i smell alot of buff and nerf times and patches :POn a personal note im surely getting this expansion since im not that interested in lore i just like the game's atmosphere and graphics and well WoW is a great game :)</div></div><hr />

That may be, but I still dont get why an asian theme suddenly should appeal to the asians. I mean, do you feel great about games with your cultural theme, wherever you are from ? I daresay you and I have no idea what appeals to asians except if you go there and ask them, because it's a totally different culture and market. It's not as easy as, asian theme = asians will love it.<br />
Example: I heard in China they dont like stories with animals beeing on one level with humans (alice in wonderland). Or lets they the government doesnt like them ;)<br />
Understand what I mean ?<br />
<br />
Oh yes, I also noticed people prophecying wow loosing to other mmos...that always sounds like the other mmos couldnt possibly screw up themselfes.

<br />
Fair enough but I think it still only improves their market share internationally which I think is where wow has always been heading. They've really done as good as they can in the US with subscriptions. Obviously they have to be careful as you say with how they market the expansion to different countries but the international success of Kung Fu Panda II had to factor into things.<br />
<br />
SWTOR, Secret World and other new mmo's could certainly fail miserably. Everyone gets that. But to say the mmo market is not getting more competitive with the introduction of these games and others is really fooling yourself. They are starting off at a disadvantage because wow has had 7+ years of content additions but with the disappointment that Cataclysm was (and yes it is a disappointment compared to Burning Crusade and Wotlk), Blizzard really wants a win with the next expansion. Desperate? Certainly not but getting closer in my opinion. I do like more competition though; if anything it will make all the games better products.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard can implement Asian elements better than Asian companies? Do you think someone who doesn't play MMO in China will say &quot;hey I want to play this game because it looks 'asian' ? &quot; LoL, there's literally dozens of MMO flooding the market that looks and feel more Asian than WoW ever will be. But that's not the selling point of WoW, isn't it? This expansion, in fact, is aimed directly at western audience, who usually doesn't get any exposure to Asian influence. Obviously it's up to you whether you like it or hate it, but stop making excuses.</div></div><hr />

Strongly agree.<br />
<br />
Its not like games haven't been borrowing ideas since the beginning of time.<br />
<br />
People keep complaining that they are leaving WoW to play some other game that has features WoW lacks, and then people complain that woW is &quot;ripping-off&quot; other games when WoW tries to add the features people say they are leaving for...<br />
<br />
Do these other games have a copyright or patent on these game features?<br />

Might be a few decent things in there but I can find those in the new mmos coming out at the end of 2011 and in 2012. And linking a 1 year wow subscription to D3? desperate...just sad. Especially if you read the fine print on that agreement. If you cancel your wow subscription within that 1 year period you lose access to D3. I guess blizz is just desperate to keep their numbers looking higher than they actually are by offering this deal. A shame I enjoyed WOW for many years, but its time to move onto bigger and better things.

Developers have to cater to their consumer base. In the beginning, WoW was &quot;hardcore&quot; because that attracted the current focus of the MMORPG. With the popularity generated during Burning Crusade, Blizzard gathered a more diverse fanbase, leading to the eventual dilution of difficulty from Lich King through Cataclysm to Mists of Pandaria. I'm not one of the &quot;I've played since Vanilla release&quot; assholes that wave their e-peen in everyone's face, but I have been a raider since BC. While I certainly enjoyed the difficulty at the time with SSC/TK, BT, and Sunwell, my play time and focus have shifted. I'm no longer a college kid that can stay up till 2AM and raid 6 hours straight the majority of the week. I'm lucky to get 3-4 hour blocks to play, period, and I'd rather not be bashing my head against a boss and incurring repair bills that I can't afford because I don't have time for dailies if I want to be in the raid. With 4.3 (and appropriate gear), I can raid when I want, get gear, and see content, the way it should be if I'm paying $50 for the software and a sub fee on top of that. While I'm not sure if I like the new talent system, the biggest issue is really that it's a big change from what we're used to. Get over yourselves, people. Games need to change after 7 years if they want to stay current. Subscription decay happens with time and speeds up the farther it gets. The MoP changes are purely what Blizzard needs to do to maintain the status quo and replace the sub fees they will lose. WoW no longer needs to be their cash cow, with the release of D3, SC3, and Titan in the future. Honestly, I got into WoW because I loved the story from Warcraft 3. Lich King covered the end of that story. Now, I'm just waiting for the entrance of Sargeras and the destruction of the Burning Legion, whatever expansion that turns out to be.</div></div><hr />

I mean, just look at the themes of each expansions. BC: Illidan and a big bunch of demons. Wrath: Arthas, undeads and vikings everywhere. Cata: A big ass dragon who wants to destroy the world. MoP: pandas... I'm really disappointed with the new class too, it does not have its place in WoW in my opinion, as a mob sure but not as a class.</div></div><hr />
