Blizzard sent a preview of the talents of 4 classes in Cataclysm: the Druid, Priest, Rogue, and Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Subtlety Tree<br />
<br />
Tier 9 (Left to Right)<br />

So, no improvement?.. in TBC it broke CC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nak</div><div class="date">2010-06-10, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the changes to Assasination, &lt;3 Vendetta.<br />
<br />
Also some cool changes to Combat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Opala</div><div class="date">2010-06-10, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not loving the combat changes. If this is blizz making each talent more of a choice, its not going very well. The only real choice is which average-crap talents to take to reach the good stuff. I love restless blades, but otherwise, combat isnt a great update, least not for pve</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aikouka</div><div class="date">2010-06-10, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first problem I see in Mutilate is the lack of any good Tier 2 talents for PVE purposes. You get Malice in Tier 1, but then there's Ruthlessness, but you're still missing 2 points to put you to Tier 3. I'd kinda like that Expose Armor talent to be down further (not the best use of points, but it can be helpful if you lack a warrior or simply to make it so you use no resources), but I don't see what could possibly or logically move up :/.<br />
<br />
Murderous Intent is interesting... it makes me wonder if you'll have to switch to Backstab below 35% because while it costs 60 energy, the move seems to always refund half of that. While backstab only produces a single combo point per use compared to Mutilate's 2, the damage may outweigh the lower CP generation since it will also have +15% more crit from talents. I'd really have to work some math on this to figure out if it is even worthwhile to take, but I'm assuming Blizzard wants to shake up the rotation a bit.<br />
<br />
Interesting that Master Poisoner now makes the target take increased spell damage rather than increased critical strike chance.<br />
<br />
Venemous Wounds appears to try to bolster Rupture to ensure it stays in the rotation.<br />
<br />
I'm also curious of the cooldown on Vendetta... I'd assume 3-5 minutes though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bladesinger</div><div class="date">2010-06-10, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So here's my take<br />
Assas = PvP<br />
Combat = PvE<br />
Sub = PvP<br />
too much arena fun imop</div></div><hr />

Well, that was close.<br />
<br />
A flat 20% increase in your total outgoing damage for 30 seconds is power approaching a 10-minute cooldown. It'll be insane against anything, and we haven't even addressed a possible combination with Bloodlust/Heroism.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong (and I may very well be, I'm too lazy to check right now), but I don't think Blizzard has introduced any talented abilities with cooldowns longer than three minutes. With that in mind, I'm going on record right now as saying that Vendetta as it's listed above has about as close to a 0% chance of going live as anything else in the history of the game.</div></div><hr />

Good point. Like I said, I didn't check. I guess Cold Snap has an 8 minute cooldown as well.<br />

Blizzard released information; nothing gained by not reacting to it.<br />
<br />
If Vendetta has an 8-10 minute cooldown, it might be balanced, but the implications of a combination with Bloodlust/Heroism still concern me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, 'cause that's clearly the purpose of the aoe component of killing spree: to separate the good rogues from the noobs. ::)<br />

Improved evis - Assasination speced rogues use evenom so thats a no<br />

Remorsless attacks - Will never proc on a boss fight and at level cap<br />

When we look at Venomous Wounds, Restless Blades and the new Serrated Blades, we can see that our specs won't be something like 51/x/x, x/51/x or x/x/51 but more like 54/x/x, x/54/x and x/x/54.<br />

Right now Combat feels very unrefined and unfinished for straight PvE purposes. Assuming fight mechanics don't require rogues to do any kind of off-tanking in Cataclysm and the rogue's purpose in each fight remains constant -- i.e. do as much damage as you can -- I count 7 talent points that are &quot;wasted&quot; while filling out the tree down to Killing Spree. Without knowing what the content will demand, the best use for said talent points I can manage is (in no order of importance):<br />
<br />
1/2 Improved Recuperate (using Recuperate means less-than-maximum damage output)<br />
2/2 Endurance (more Stamina never hurts, I guess, and maybe increasing time on target)<br />
2/2 Improved Sprint (perhaps increasing time on target in specific fights)<br />
2/2 Improved Kick (marginal utility increase at best)<br />
<br />
Being that this preview comes prior to Beta (not to mention release), I'm hoping that combat will be streamlined a bit more to make the tree feel less clunky for PvE. Barring that, Assassination is looking pretty tasty (despite the initial roadblock in Tier 2).</div></div><hr />

In case you didn't realize it, that's exactly how these trees are shaping up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sums it up nicely.<br />
<br />
Now i'll give you a break as you may have still been editing when all that was posted. You may also have missed many of the blizzard posts about &quot;not wanting all talents to be about damage and adding some fun stuff&quot;. <br />
<br />
Anyone from this point forward who complains about &quot;clunky builds&quot; will suffer severe (keyboard warrior) leg breakage.<br />

Not all talent points = damage upgrades = the entire point.<br />

Yeah, I've read what Blizzard intend for talents and I certainly don't expect each and every talent point to give a quantifiable increase in damage. That being said, however, the points I mentioned don't really add anything fun to the rogue experience as it exists currently. <br />
<br />
The PvE content in Cataclysm may very well change how rogues are expected to perform and, thus, how rogues approach talent builds. I think this is rather unlikely, though, as there are 3 very distinct roles in PvE and I don't expect rogues to be using any resources on anything but damage overall. Maybe Blizzard will design some encounters that require attention paid to something outside the 3 roles. If that happens, I guess I can shut it and go eat my hat. <br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Well, bollocks. I was editing my post just after you edited yours. Yeah, I remember reading that Blizzard wants some &quot;wiggle room&quot; in talent builds and I think it's a great idea. But given current and past PvE content, the talents which stand in the way of getting to the bottom of the Combat tree are very lackluster. <br />
<br />
Again, I'll admit that many variables in the situation are not set in stone, namely Cataclysm encounter design and mechanics and the talent trees themselves. And I, for one, am hopeful that whatever makes it to launch will be a fantastic product and be lots of fun. I was just pointing out what I feel to be room for improvement.</div></div><hr />

Thank you , I think this should be the headline of all these talent posts</div></div><hr />

Remorseless Attacks and Deadly Momentum might not proc on a bossfight, but they will proc on a boss' adds. Allowing to mow through them faster and get back on the boss faster.<br />
<br />
It will also proc on levelcap. Just because your XP bar doesn't move doesn't mean there's no XP coming out of that mob. Everything that's white (or even blue?) and up still technically yields XP as far as these procs are concerned. I may be wrong but that's how these things have been explained to me in the past.</div></div><hr />

I do not like the combat tree at all it is even more boring than the current one...<br />
We were spamming Sinister Strike in Vanilla. We were spamming Sinister Strike in BC. We are spamming Sinister Strike in WotLK. <br />
And we will spam Sinister Strike in Cata ...<br />
<br />
However I must admit I like the preview Assassination tree, I just hope Vandetta will not get nerfed to the ground one week after release because of PVP QQ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What if it was single-target only and didn't teleport you to potentially dangerous places eh? <br />
<br />
Of course you would lose all the great qualities of its current form like it being a huge dps increase when used in conjunction with BF SnD and hyperspeed accelerators and any other haste increase you have..<br />
<br />
I filled in the blank for you since you obviously weren't smart enough to finish it. And honestly, if you are dying while using it, that's a learn to play issue bro, not a killing spree issue. <br />
<br />
I've only died once while using it because I stupidly forgot to tricks at the start of the boss fight, used KS with all my haste buffs, pulled aggro and died.<br />
<br />
More on topic: Has anyone made a sub pve spec? Holy shit, talk about bloated. I had one point to spend on utility in the form of one point in camouflage. At least give us some points to put into cheat death or filthy tricks. It has cookie cutter spec written all over it. Then again, id be happy if sub was at least viable for pve, I'll deal with the bloat to have shadowstep.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amduscia</div><div class="date">2010-06-11, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, the Expose Armor talent seems out of place in Assassination because poison damage seems to be a focus of the tree so it already has a way to bypass armor. Sub and Combat are both heavy users of todays ArPen and with sub currently as bloated as it is and combat lacking in armor penetration it seems like it belongs in Combat.<br />

Learn to read, I didn't say it was a bad dps talent. I said the aoe part of the spell is clunky and that there is no good reason for it not to be single target. <br />
<br />
And I don't spend my time dying while using it, thank you. It's just ridiculous that the possibility even exists.</div></div><hr />
