A new beta build will be deployed on beta realms soon. Our notes should now be mostly complete, so be sure to look over your classes' changes once again! <br />
<br />
Raid Testing - Starting Soon<br />
We plan to start Mists of Pandaria Beta raid testing this Friday, June 22. We'll begin testing with the 10 player Normal difficulty version of the Stone Guard in Mogu'shan Palace. Available testing times for testing will be posted soon. 25 player Normal difficulty testing should begin next week, with Raid Finder and Heroic difficulty testing to follow in the weeks ahead.<br />
<br />
You must be level 90 to participate in the raid test, and level 90 character templates will not initially be available. We do have some new technology that automatically raises or lowers your items to the appropriate level for testing. So as long as you have a Mists of Pandaria quest or dungeon item in every slot, you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Note that player interface add-ons are disabled on the beta at this time while we work through some technical issues. They'll be available once again at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
As always with raid testing on beta or public test realms, the schedule is subject to change or cancellation with very little warning. Server issues, build issues, newly discovered encounter, combat, or class bugs, and many other reasons could prevent testing. While I will endeavor to provide warning about future tests, this will also not always be possible. Whatever I do know, I'll post here in the Beta Dungeons forum as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to everyone's feedback (it really does matter!), and my thanks to everyone who's able to participate in the upcoming tests. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bluspacecow</div><div class="date">2012-06-20, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you get acces to all of this?<br />
<br />
Easier then you might think.<br />
<br />
You see before the patch servers server push a patch live to the beta realms it gets uploaded to the CDN servers first. Blizzard has access to three of those and always uses a very predictable path to all the patch files. For new builds its the same URLs except with a different build number.<br />
<br />
So if you know the places the files are uploaded and their names you can figure out the URL for a new build you just gotta know the new build number.<br />
<br />
CDN servers will give the standard reply of &quot;File not found&quot; as a string for a file that's not there.<br />
<br />
There are several ways of finding out a new build number from the slightly complex of querying the patch server in a special way to the dumber and slower way of simply continually downloading new build numbers until you get valid patch files.<br />
<br />
So now you have a set of new patch files. <br />
<br />
From there you just toss it to some automated analysis tools to rip the patch apart and give you all the data you need for a post. You take that data and throw it at something that formats it nicely for a post , proof read it then post it.<br />
<br />
That's in essentially how it's done in a simplified fashion :)</div></div><hr />

You should start to download this if you open the PTR launcher.<br />
<br />
If you're manually downloading those files they go under <br />
<br />
Wow PTR folder -&gt; TempMig -&gt; 5.0Migration-data<br />
<br />
No idea when they intend to open the PTR for MoP but the migration data's on the PTR background downloader. Has been since the 1st of the month actually.</div></div><hr />

Holy paladin BUFFS? What's this world coming to?<br />
Funny enough, Obi Won told me that &quot;these are not the buffs you are looking for&quot;. We've lost so much haste with the loss of DF and Judgments of the pure that the class feels almost unplayable.<br />
We do have some great spells, but everything seems to be a 2.4 second cast. Now I know it's all gear dependent, but I haven't seen huge upgrades in gear yet. Maybe it'll change after they open up raids...I do know a LOT of holy palys that are re-rolling due to the haste and mana nerfs we've been so graciously given.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems blizzard is afraid prot warriors will top meters with the 7k devastates we have now, if we are allowed to switch stances while not tanking. Fair and balanced. I guess the ability to kill a few mobs while leveling or questing as prot was too much to ask for. And why is not DK locked to blood presence if they want vengance?</div></div><hr />

They've said on numerous occasions over the years that they feel that rogue is the best-designed class in the game. So, they don't tweak it much because they consider it pretty much just right. It's the rest of the classes that they're constantly tweaking to try and get them into the same sweet spot as rogues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They DESTROYED SW: D. Well, under 20% health (down from 25% in Cata btw) it's extremly potent, for bosses... but for pvp it's useless indeed. Also you kinda NOT want to use it above 20% health, as it will only scratch the target, while raping yourself bad!  (thinking of movement fights, where I would throw some sw:d around, replenishing my mana while doing &quot;some&quot; damage... now completly useless)</div></div><hr />

Losing the ability to switch to battle/berserker stance on taunt fights makes prot warriors do absolutely zero dps, since most of the rage is generated from being hit. Revenge requires you to parry or dodge. Enrage requires a critical block. So thats the bulk of the rage out the window. There you are left hitting the free attacks whatever procs, maybe executing once in a while if you can build up the rage. In defensive stance there is also absolutely no scaling with haste, so bloodlust does not even affect prot warriors anymore. Its not what i call warrior like thats for sure.</div></div><hr />

Just stop talking, you are making yourself look like an ass. I haven't been able to use vengeance in kitty form since it was invented and I have never complained. Also you obviously know nothing of hOw tanking is planned to work in mop. All our rage is going to be generated by our attacks, not from being hit.<br />

I looked at the item on WoWHead (I think it was) and it said next to the item in brackets (also quests) so I'm sure it is. also if it wasn't then it would say on the item &quot;Increase experience gained from killing mobs&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just looked at the spell effect on Wowhead and it says: <br />
<br />
Effect #1	Apply Aura: Mod Experience Gained % (Quests too)<br />
Value: 300<br />
Effect #2	Apply Aura: Mod Experience Gained % (mob kills only)<br />
Value: 300</div></div><hr />
