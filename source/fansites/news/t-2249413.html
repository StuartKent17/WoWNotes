Hit &quot;Get Tickets&quot; at 7:00 almost on the dot, sat in queue for 10 minutes, got hit with &quot;no tickets are currently available&quot;.<br />
<br />
Congrats to those who got one. Wish it wasn't so hard to buy these… been playing WoW since 2005 but this is the first year I don't have some kind of major obstacle that would've kept me from going. Oh well, hope the streams are better this year I guess.</div></div><hr />

The first year had streams for every panel, ive noticed its been less each year. Last time I went was when they announced WoD and damn was it crowded. Everything had a line, even to buy overpriced cheap quality beer. It ruined it for me compared to the first time we went. The live stream is better anyways, you only really need to go once to experience it and realize it's full of ppl tagging along the band wagon.</div></div><hr />
