Undead on a Raptor on a Shark with frickin' laser beams!<br />
I know I already posted it on Facebook and Twitter but ... damn, it's a Undead on a Raptor on a Shark with frickin' laser beams!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/july/undeadonraptoronsharkwithfrickinlaserbeams_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/july/undeadonraptoronsharkwithfrickinlaserbeams.jpg)<br />
<br />
Maybe I missed the memo on levels of &quot;epicosity&quot; or something, but I'm pretty sure the Maelstrom is a CLASS 10 epic zone. Though I guess it is missing sharks with laser beams patrolling the waters and Arthur Fonzarelli jumping across it with water skis. And dinosaurs. <br />
<br />
[...] After reading this post I called for a meeting with TOP TOP MEN (that's two tops) in order to figure out a solution to the problem at hand. Frankly, I think we hit a home run. The next 4.0 build (or the one after) should have a Maelstrom that's between 10 - 50x more epic than what currently exists.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/mage.jpg Fire Mage Talent Preview<br />
Quick preview of upcoming fire changes (talents are from left to right, *denotes a change to the talent):<br />
<br />
Tier 1:<br />
Master of Elements: now 2 ranks at 15/30%<br />
Burning Soul<br />
Incineration: removed<br />
Improved Fire Blast: moved from tier 2<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 2:<br />
Ignite<br />
Fire Power: Increases the damage of your Fire spells by 1/2/3% and gives your Flame Orb a 33/66/100% chance to explode at the end of its duration.<br />
Blazing Speed<br />
Impact (no useful raid utility yet... awesome ideas welcome)<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 3:<br />
Cauterize (new, 2 ranks): You have a 50/100%% chance that an attack which would otherwise kill you will instead bring you to 40% of your maximum health. However, you will burn for 12% of your maximum health every second for the next 4 sec. This effect cannot occur more than once per minute.<br />
Blast Wave: A wave of flame radiates outward from the target location, damaging all enemies caught within the blast for X Fire damage and are slowed by 75% for 3 sec.<br />
Molten Shields (new 1 rank, Blazing Speed is a prereq): Reduces the global cooldown of your Mage Ward spell by 1.5 sec and your Mage Ward triggers the Blazing Speed effect when it dissipates from absorbing damage.<br />
Improved Scorch: Reduces the mana cost of your Scorch spell by 50/100%<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 4:<br />
Pyromaniac<br />
Combustion<br />
Hot Streak (the instant Pyroblast no longer costs mana)<br />
Firestarter (new, 1 rank): Your Molten Armor allows you to cast the Scorch spell while moving instead of reducing the chance you are critically hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 5:<br />
Improved Flamestrike<br />
Dragon's Breath<br />
Molten Fury<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 6:<br />
Critical Mass: Your Pyroblast and Scorch spells have a 33/66/100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to spell damage, increasing spell critical strike chance against that target by 5% and lasts 30 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 7:<br />
Living Bomb <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

End of Arena Season<br />
The only information that we have to share with you right now is that we will announce the end of the arena season when it is almost over, just like in every previous season. We don't provide date estimates on anything and this is no exception. Several other people understood what I was saying and the end result is that you will have to wait.

Survival &quot;Melee Attack Speed&quot; buff in Raid Buffs List<br />
The &quot;20% melee attack speed&quot; is in fact melee and ranged attack speed. That was just developer shorthand on my part.<br />
<br />
The effect for Survival will probably get tied into Hunting Party since Replenishment alone doesn't do anything for hunters and longer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262989101/concerned-about-survival-s-future/))<br />

Water Elemental Cooldown<br />
The post-death cooldown will definitely be lowered to around 2 min, the intent is definitely that after it dies you're waiting a somewhat similar amount of time before it's up again as you would have under the old scheme. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702262953/mage/))<br />

<br />
Reactive Barrier<br />
There's a reasonable chance a talent like this ends up being better in practical use than in theorycraft. It could end up needing a little something extra, or a redesign, but I'm willing to let it ride for a while to see how it actually plays out.

Shadow<br />
We haven't worked on the Shadow tree much after out initial pass (that brought Shadowy Apparition et al.). We're working on it now. Please don't expect a total overhaul where every talent is redesigned, but we are taking a hard look at all of the damage talents and trying to make the talent choices more compelling (which often means harder).

Elusiveness / Dirty Tricks<br />
Elusiveness being too deep was considered a grave injustice. So we moved it up and switched it with Dirty Tricks, causing a new injustice. We'll try and find room in tier 2 for both. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262769761/rogues-blizzard-aren-t-idiots/))<br />

Totems<br />
We're fine with totem health given how easy totems are to replace. We also think it's fine to have to (sometimes) choose between a buff totem and a non-buff totem given how many different things a shaman can do.<br />
<br />
However, we are going to increase buff totem range (and possibly other totem range) and we have figured out a way to make Searing Totem attack your target, instead of a random and probably inappropriate target.

<br />
Protection changes in Build 12664<br />
We buffed Thunder Clap to make up for the loss of the Imp TClap talent. We buffed Shockwave just because it got caught up in the big AE nerf, but it's really not an AE on the level of Hurricane / Blizzard. We buffed Devastate because we realized we had forgotten to compensate it for reducing the number of Sunder stacks.<br />
<br />
All of those changes should bring Prot warrior abilities back to something that feels more normal to a current warrior.<br />
<br />
Currently we are looking really hard at AE damage abilities by all tanks. We tried Thunder Clap with no cooldown and didn't like it. We also tried Thunder Clap with a Consecrate-like talent, but I'm not sure we like that either. At the moment we are thinking of nerfing any of the really passive AEs, including Swipe, Death and Decay, Damage Shield and Consecrate. All of those abilities (well, maybe not Damage Shield) would still be usable, but they would be more situational.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that we think all tanks need to be able to trivially handle the massive adds or straggling adds situations easily, or none of them should be able to. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262869673/warrior-12664-changes-and-discussion/))<br />

Nope. Mastery was cut into only one bonus (from previous 3) which is now presented. Rest of mastery bonuses were practically baked into talent trees with rehaul (31/10 pts, must select tree)<br />

The bottom line is that we think all tanks need to be able to trivially handle the massive adds or straggling adds situations easily, or none of them should be able to.<br />
<br />
[quote]<br />
<br />
homogenization ftw - but seriously, if they end up going with none of them should be (which I doubt) that would require them to review already designed raid/dungeon encounters as well as require dps to actually pay attention to threat again and single target every pull...while I personally think that would be a good thing there is no way blizzard would have the balls to upset so many of their customer base whom consider the requirement to use their brains and/or situational talents to defeat mobs, while sacrificing dps in the process, heresy.<br />

Yes, you're the only disc priest tired of it being slapped around, because apparently you're the only disc priest who doesn't understand that the thing that makes us different is absorbs and they're freaking awesome. The additional module for recount that guesses absorbs has mine with a minimum of half of my &quot;healing&quot; to be through absorbs. If you're not putting up shields and you're disc?

Have you looked at the warrior talent trees at all???<br />
<br />
Blood and Thunder<br />
Rank 1-2 When you Thunder Clap a target affected by your Rend, you have a [50%/100%] chance to affect every target with Rend.<br />
<br />
Thunderstruck<br />
Rank 1-2 Your Thunder Clap leaves a zone of energy on the ground for [5/10] sec, dealing 0 damage every 0 seconds to enemies that cross it.<br />
<br />
Warriors are getting consecrate and aoe bleeds. I think saying they aren't viable aoe tanks is pretty absurd. Also, you need to remember that aoe tank should be less necessary come cataclysm as CCing mobs will be back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Masteries were taken out of the game , so that they could adjust the talent trees to some extend, before implementing the masteries. <br />
- The 2 &quot;lesser&quot; masteries were baked into the bonuses you get when you select a certain talent tree at lvl 10.<br />
- Disc priests to ALOT (50'ish % I think) of their healing through absorbsions, stop complaining.<br />
- Yes some masteries are more dull. Blizzard never stated that they would all be fun and game changing in any way. they are just bonuses. Period. Some just happen to &quot;seem&quot; more fun.<br />
- It's still Beta.<br />

<br />
Blood and Thunder<br />
Rank 1-2 When you Thunder Clap a target affected by your Rend, you have a [50%/100%] chance to affect every target with Rend.<br />
<br />
Thunderstruck<br />
Rank 1-2 Your Thunder Clap leaves a zone of energy on the ground for [5/10] sec, dealing 0 damage every 0 seconds to enemies that cross it.<br />
<br />
Warriors are getting consecrate and aoe bleeds. I think saying they aren't viable aoe tanks is pretty absurd. Also, you need to remember that aoe tank should be less necessary come cataclysm as CCing mobs will be back.<br />
<br />
obviously you didnt read blizzard blue post lemme guess reading is too hard for you<br />
Currently we are looking really hard at AE damage abilities by all tanks. We tried Thunder Clap with no cooldown and didn't like it. We also tried Thunder Clap with a Consecrate-like talent, but I'm not sure we like that either. At the moment we are thinking of nerfing any of the really passive AEs, including Swipe, Death and Decay, Damage Shield and Consecrate. All of those abilities (well, maybe not Damage Shield) would still be usable, but they would be more situational.</div></div><hr />

Obviously you're a complete tool cuntbag retard, all of those other PASSIVE ae's are getting nerfed, thunderclap IS STILL getting the same (talented) buff.<br />
<br />
So whose the dipshit with the reading comprehension problem? You obviously.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fletchi</div><div class="date">2010-07-31, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my &quot;mastery&quot; analyzes from my main characters point of view, holy priest since classic; Ignore or correct at your convenience.<br />
<br />
So what do we get?<br />
For Holy priests we start out with a baseline 10% HoT over 6 seconds for every targeted heals. I'm guessing circle of healing and prayer of mending is excluded here. As far as I can tell you max out at 10% when you have placed 31 points in the holy tree, and with a rough head math can be achieved at level 76 or 78.<br />
Did I start out to say baseline 10% HoT? It will only matter in heroics and raids, so thats what you start out with when you your role becomes more serious at level 85 :)<br />
<br />
This should immediately be better then our current tier-10 2-piece bonus, which is a 33% chance for a 33% HoT on our flash heal. 33% is more then 10% but then its only 1/3 chance for it to apply, so in reality its a 11% HoT for our one spell only, and for a holy priest on raid healing duty the amount of healing coming from FH is small.<br />
<br />
If its true that mana conservation has a more important role in conjunction with significantly larger health pools vs. incoming damage, then the mastery bonus won't just become over-heals; As that would be the usual result today if it was implemented.<br />
I want to point out that none of the beta testers have experienced end game yet or even come close to it. They are just playing around the first few instances that is equal to the normal version of The Nexux and Utgard Keep. Healing has yet to become serious.<br />
But without anyone experiencing the end game of Cata yet, and if we can believe Blizzard promises, I'm pretty confident that the mastery bonus can be easily translated to actual healing. 10% mastery bonus = 10% extra healing done. If you are raid healing that is and performing your role as should be.<br />
<br />
What I know nothing about is how this mastery bonus will scale. Will it become less significant into the expansions raiding tiers? Or will it become more prevalent, eating up more of your total healing done. Will there be lots of items dropping with mastery bonuses before even starting end game content? And again, how significant will that be, like 11% when you start out raiding?<br />
<br />
Overall I think its exciting the more I think about it. I know I won't be the one whining if mana conservation becomes very important. It will force the issue down to the other team members that you cannot ignore the environmental damage anymore; it will make the encounter impossible until they shape up.<br />
Sure, it might start out with the blaming game where the raid healers and tank healers is the target. But over time they have to realize the fact that none of the healers geared for the content can do as they ask.<br />
<br />
Alright, that my open thoughts on the issue, typing more will just make an impenetrable wall that no-one reads :)</div></div><hr />

Well, yes, but you know .. there are fun masteries, not just plain dps increase. Like spriest Shadow Orbs or additional hits for reduced dps like for Marks Hunter, Ele Shammy .. etc.<br />

You know, those are proc chances so their dps isn't balanced around having them all the time, and they add some fun part to the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ah see a little research and I answered my own question.... /fail<br />
<br />
&quot;The Rise of Specialization <br />
<br />
We want to focus the talent trees towards your chosen style of gameplay right away. That first point you spend in a tree should be very meaningful. If you choose Enhancement, we want you to feel like an Enhancement shaman right away, not thirty talent points later. When talent trees are unlocked at level 10, you will be asked to choose your specialization (e.g. whether you want to be an Arms, Fury or Protection warrior) before spending that first point. Making this choice comes with certain benefits, including whatever passive bonuses you need to be effective in that role, and a signature ability that used to be buried deeper in the talent trees. These abilities and bonuses are only available by specializing in a specific tree. Each tree awards its own unique active ability and passives when chosen. The passive bonuses range from flat percentage increases, like a 20% increase to Fire damage for Fire mages or spell range increases for casters, to more interesting passives such as the passive rage regeneration of the former Anger Management talent for Arms warriors, Dual-Wield Specialization for Fury warriors and Combat rogues, or the ability to dual-wield itself for Enhancement shaman. <br />
<br />
The initial talent tree selection unlocks active abilities that are core to the chosen role. Our goal is to choose abilities that let the specializations come into their own much earlier than was possible when a specialization-defining talent had to be buried deep enough that other talent trees couldn&#8217;t access them. For example, having Lava Lash and Dual-Wield right away lets an Enhancement shaman feel like an Enhancement shaman. Other role-defining examples of abilities players can now get for free at level 10 include Mortal Strike, Bloodthirst, Shield Slam, Mutilate, Shadow Step, Thunderstorm, Earth Shield, Water Elemental, and Penance. &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, those aren't that much more fun. Arcane and Shadow are really the only masteries that will affect your playstyle. 10% of a fireball as a DoT is the same thing (if not worse) than +10% damage.</div></div><hr />

-You're dumb, I don't see a rebuttal to anything he said in that block of text you copy/pasted. Just because they may or may not be (and it's a BIG may not) nerfing some of the other aoe tanking abilities doesn't mean they aren't still modifying the warrior ones.<br />
<br />
couple more things...<br />
-Frost DKs, quit complaining you do broken as hell damage at high gear levels, and you most likely will continue to.<br />
-Whoever said they are happy that the masteries are giving cool bonuses, and not just damage increases... You mentioned shadow orbs... other than being shiny black balls, do you know what the ONLY purpose of the orbs is? A damage increase. Masteries are bland for the most part, accept it.<br />
-I can't wait for cata, for one simple reason. To see all the scrub dps who get carried stop getting carried. Now dps will have to actually pay attention to surroundings instead of just letting the Geared to hell healers treat them like a tank and just healspam while yelling at them in vent when they aren't even IN VENT. Phew, sorry, ranted a bit there. But seriously, you'll see like 99% less hunters endgame, they'll all be screaming at healers on the first raid boss with serious environmental hazards.</div></div><hr />

I hear worse things than that at my job. Fact of the matter is, we all know it's a slippery slope, one thing will lead to another. This place will end up like the cesspool that the official forums are. Having differing opinions is one thing, but calling people &quot;retards, cuntbags&quot; etc is not needed for discussion. It's the easiest to single out, and it's the reason why WoW and gamers in general are looked down upon. Those official forums are a disaster, Blizzard admitted as much. This place will go the same route due to this nonsense. You won't be able to come here for discussion, it'll just be childish insults non-stop with no substance behind them.<br />
<br />
I'll probably just go to my other gaming forums that just one person copies and pastes the news from here so I don't head to see this stuff.</div></div><hr />

Having differing opinions is one thing, but calling people &quot;retards, cuntbags&quot; etc is not needed for discussion. It's the easiest to single out, and it's the reason why WoW and gamers in general are looked down upon. Those official forums are a disaster, Blizzard admitted as much. This place will go the same route due to this nonsense. You won't be able to come here for discussion, it'll just be childish insults non-stop with no substance behind them.<br />
<br />
I'll probably just go to my other gaming forums that just one person copies and pastes the news from here so I don't head to see this stuff.<br />
<br />
No offense nor am I insulting you but i had to say something after seeing your posts earlier and from this thread, Iv actually seen you post on here, the reason you particularly see alot of this stuff is you post some pretty retarded things. You kind of rage about things that are stupid and since you get so heated your posts come across whiney and &quot;childish&quot; and thus trolls come at you to further tick you off. Mind you, you arent wrong in what you say but the way you say it is just wrong.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />

Malfurion. Looks. Mediocre. I've seen better looking artwork on parents fridge that their elementary school kids drawn up. It's pretty clear that Blizzard just isn't trying anymore. They really pulled their &quot;A-team&quot; off this game, it's really showing now. Between these models, and the recent hideous weapon models, it's clear that it's certainly not Blizzard's &quot;A-team&quot; on the game anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malfurion. Looks. Awesome.&quot; - Lol. It's pretty evident that Blizzard has such a blind and brainwashed following that'll stick with them no matter how much they lame out on the game. I have an awesome bridge I'd like to negotiate a sale of.<br />
<br />
Is a highly confrontational way to post your feelings, and for people who are happy with the game or respect the company it can be a button pusher to give someone a reason to come at you. Oh and before you attempt to post about who is and who isnt developing their games or the decisions they make based off they dont care about this game anymore and sent their guys to work on other projects. Almost all of their developement team is still the same. There is only so much you can do with models to keep them with the feel of this game and the expansion theyre supposed to represent, so saying they pushed their &quot;A-team&quot; off this game is wrong.<br />
<br />
The above combined with the stuff you post recently and the way you post it is the reason you see such &quot;horrible and rude&quot; comments. If anything the way you post is just as bad as the way you get posted to, and both are part of the problem, so please stop acting like youre not doing anything wrong and its everyone else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps: The model isnt amazing or godly, but its not as bad as you so poorly put it above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: About your comments about mmo champs poor moderation they are constantly banning people everyday who cross the line and post poorly, so to say the moderation on here is a joke and if it continues these forums will turn into the &quot;cespool known as the wow public forums&quot; is really incorrect.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: OH and btw if 90% of the people love their new models/ideas etc and 10% dont then they did what they achieved. I think some of their models are questionable but generally from what i have seen we are seeing alot better work then their past. They cant make EVERY SINGLE PERSON happy, every model they make is carefully analyzed by a group who deems it good or not and in the right direction, they dont just make a model and throw it in the game and leave it at that.</div></div><hr />

My suspicion is that it won't make it out of beta.<br />
Your lack of comprehension doesn't make sense. Path of the Titans is just another tier of glyphs that's being implemented another way, it never had anything to do with the mastery system at all ever.</div></div><hr />

I'm intrigued!</div></div><hr />

I know its just a BETa and not completly done but I like it ... + i got a little idea about Impact ... <br />
<br />
It will be cool and usefull imo to add a knockback effect to it ... <br />
<br />
Impact (1/2) : Gives your damaging spells (4-5%,8-10%) chance to cause the next Fire Blast you cast to knockback the enemy 5yd away and stun them for (1/2) second ... ( The targets that is immune to stun or knockback effect will take 15% aditional damage ) ...<br />
<br />
Something like that ... what you think ?</div></div><hr />

+15% damage is just boring in PvE. And nothing really changes with a 5 yd knockback, 5 yards is almost nothing. It's a good idea but it's the old talent idea mentality, it has to be way better/more fun in the current talent trees.</div></div><hr />

I mean use knockback for interrupt spellcasting ... + Will be fun to PvP with Fire (But I like more Arcane tree) and Fire tree need something to throw away the target not only 30 sec cd Blast Wave and 20sec Dragon's Breath ... <br />
<br />
Maybe 15% more damage is boring but In cata we need more CC so knockback will be fine if someone from party/raid agro-ed and tank will have 1-2 sec to get back agro ... <br />
<br />
That is just my little idea ... :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duticyaa</div><div class="date">2010-08-01, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it would be cool if the Impact talent, added some sort of Judgement of Wisdom / Mana drain debuff on the boss, like:<br />
<br />
Gives your damaging spells a 5/10% chance to cause the next Fire Blast you cast to stun the target for 2 seconds, and add the &quot;insert cool debuff name here&quot; effect on the target, giving each attack against the target, a chance to steal 2% of the attacker's base.<br />
<br />
Thus fire mages would bring Judgement of Wisdom to the raid, and it would also have a purpose and synergy in pvp. If the &quot;mana drain&quot; thingy is to OP in PvP, you could add some sort of, &quot;if the target is immune to the stun, &quot;insert cool debuff name here&quot; is applied to the target&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nethersys</div><div class="date">2010-08-01, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea too ... but I don't wish to have JoW debuff bcoz we got Evocation + Arcane Intellect will bring mana instead of Intellect and some mana regen if I am not mistaken ... so in raid/party we are needed ... I think the Impact should be some sort of PvP talent ... and provide a little damage or like you say debuff to non-player targets :rolleyes: ...</div></div><hr />

There are some classes that have out right extra damage like enhance shammies and destro locks but then there are classes that have a 16% chance for a gimped auto swing or shot like marks hunters and arms warrs. It doesnt quiet seem fair but idk maybe the class damaged is buffed around the masteries so it turns out to be an even playing field....Only time will tell</div></div><hr />

EG: Lady Deathwhisper Bow is 4% Chance to procc and it's about 5% overall dmg ;)</div></div><hr />

&quot;For example, a level 82 player will get 1 Mastery point for each 93 Mastery Rating he has. This mastery point will increase the mastery bonus differently depending on the class, +1 Mastery Point doesn't necessarily means a +1% increase to the bonus&quot;<br />
<br />
is Old...<br />
<br />
The new Value is: 79 Masteryratin for 1 MasteryPoint.. <br />
The Example is my Fire Mage Karatnos:<br />
He has 309 Masteryrating and +3.9 Masterypoints = 79,23...<br />
<br />
The rest is ok &quot;(e.g. A Beast Mastery hunter with +2 Mastery gets +4% increased pet damage)&quot;<br />
I get for 1 Masterypoint 2,5% more Fire Periodic Damage</div></div><hr />
