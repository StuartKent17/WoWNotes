<br />
Legendary Item Upgrades<br />
With the Tomb of Sargeras release, you can upgrade your legendary items to item level 970 by completing another collection quest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/47791-unsettled-power).<br />
<br />
<br />
Unsettled Power (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/47791-unsettled-power) requires the collection of 50 x Writhing Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151375-writhing-essence). <br />
You don't need to pick up the quest to start collecting these items. <br />
Stabilized Titan Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151423-stabilized-titan-essence) upgrades a Legion legendary item from any item level to item level 970. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2.5 Hotfixes - June 19<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
I know blizz are stubborn but you must realise faction arena titles was a huge mistake. Has there been any positive feedback? <br />
Quite the contrary, it is having the desired effect. For example, in NA the cutoff difference between each faction is very close.<br />
(holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/873555272056176640))<br />
What Im noticing is top players just camp an alt of their main class &quot;2nd druid&quot; on the easier faction. Even a 50 point difference is big.<br />
Probably a few but not the majority. Likewise we were told &quot;everyone switches and switches back&quot; but in reality, it wasn't the case for most (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/873559802558816256))<br />
On Eu it feels kind of weird since for example last season people on horde got r1 with 100 Rating lower than alliance.<br />
We expect that gap to continue to shrink over time. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/873563519098142720))<br />
<br />
what is blizzard trying to achieve then if its having its desired effect? A 3000 rated alliance player missing r1 and a 2900 horde gets it?<br />
Our intent is to distribute our best PvP players as evenly as possible between both factions as that benefits the game as a whole. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/873606046274641920))<br />
With each season since the change to faction based titles, we have seen that distribution improve. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/873607458492620800))<br />
No it doesn't, the most beneficial is when all of the best PvP players play 1 faction so they can all play with eachother.<br />
We fundamentally disagree on that point. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/873607768942313472))<br />
<br />
is there anyway to track 150 wins after faction changing 2 times? i xfered horde played there then went back. WarcraftDevs<br />
There isn't really and admit that it's a problem we need to correct for the future. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/873914526080524289))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What is the best approach to rebalancing a particular ability/champion/class/etc. - to do one large, comprehensive balance pass over one update, or several smaller, incremental balance passes over many updates?<br />
All things being equal, I would advocate that it’s better to do it once. Touching something in many updates just increases the chance of introducing bugs, makes it feel like balance is unresolved (and therefore perhaps not worth players’ time to invest in mastering it), and can also get really wearying for players who play that character.<br />
<br />
However, overdoing a change has all of these risks and even more. Overshooting a target and then having to revert changes adds to the sense that game balance isn’t anywhere approaching stable and can feel ever crappier to players who love that character than slowly creeping towards a target.<br />
<br />
It’s one of those Price is Right deals - get as close as you can without going over.<br />
<br />
Now sometimes we’ll run into a situation where small +3% changes don’t have a meaningful impact. In those cases, it’s entirely possible that we don’t even have a sense for the order of magnitude. We’re tuning the dial by 3% when really it’s going to take a 50% buff or nerf to solve the problem. That clearly could take a really long time. <br />
<br />
If this seems to be happening, I would advocate for making a massive change - double the number or whatever. You will likely overshoot your target, perhaps by a lot, but at least you’ll know where the endpoints of your continuum are so you can try to get things somewhere in the middle. This tactic works much better for internal testing where you can explain your goals (finding the extremes) than foisting it on players who have to suffer even more balance problems just so you can get your shit together.

<br />
Still..it`s supposed to be a fantasy world, not a fairy tale land...Mostly in the fantasy literature, the worlds have their own -similar- rules like our real Earth have..aka gravity, planets, moons and sun, normal life standards (born-live-die) with few exceptions (like coming back as undead) need food and water for sustenance your body, etc...If a planet appears out of nowhere....world wide catastrophe immediately, most likely the extinction of every living organism.<br />
I thought the completely fucked up time/dimension travel was the bottom line, but looks like no, it was not....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe we're leaving Azeroth for good. I mean we're going to Argus. Who knows. I'm only mildly interested in how this turns out anyway. I actually liked Legion, but I'm still not playing very much. I'm not sure there's much Blizzard can do to change that. Been playing for years but other things in life are drawing my attention more so beyond raiding I don't particularly care all that much these days.</div></div><hr />
