<br />
No one is complaining about the amount of money, only about the irony of needing an active sub during the longest content drought ever to have a chance at winning a key.<br />
I can understand them, I wouldn't do it neither even though I have no problem with the price for a WoW sub ( if there is a flying f to do in the game that is )<br />
<br />
Either way I got in 2 weeks ago with a contest but gating this first week behind a sub wall during epic content drought is pretty EleGiggle.</div></div><hr />

Fortunately for us un-subbed, you don't know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
I'm quite dedicated, just not willing to pay a bunch of money to have characters sit around and wait. <br />
<br />
Honestly, of the two of us, I think that makes me the smarter one.<br />
<br />
Since you're going to insult un-subbed, I figure that makes you fair game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A person can be dedicated to the game and still have run out of things to do... I'm not going to pay for a sub when I have exhausted all the content available and played it to death and then beat it some more... This isn't a matter of dedication, only a moron spends money on something they won't play, regardless of how much they like the game, and I do love this game, a lack of content is still a lack of content... and I have no reason to play the current content any longer.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and you are SO smart for not playing the game, because its not like those that still sub, actually could have reasons for playing even though you do not. Right?<br />
<br />
I think it's a perfect restriction, too many already use the beta as a demo instead of contributing. At least if they are subbed, you know they're not people that never tried WoW before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All that needs to be done to get around that issue is require some achievement from current content, like what WoWhead did for theirs, they required HFC LFR wing completion achievements... That doesn't require an active sub and still ensures they have at least played the current patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing since 2005. I'm unsubbed because WoD has been the same thing for a year. I've done Tanaan as much as I want to, so I unsubbed. Apparently you can categorize all un-subbed people as &quot;people that never tried WoW before&quot; and all we will do is use it as a demo.<br />
<br />
Don't categorize us all the same. You don't know what you're saying.<br />
<br />
Also, they need people that have never tried WoW before to test in Beta. They just came out and said as much because newbies will do things that we wouldn't think of doing, or wouldn't know to do something that we think is second nature.<br />
<br />
You obviously have no idea what a beta is for.</div></div><hr />

But I still think blizzard should prioritize subs more than others for beta access. I am only subbed because quit after BRF was opened and came back in jannuary 2016 and started raiding again. The game is incredibly boring and trash. I don't even log on for anything other than raids right now. been like this from march. I got bored of hfc / Taan in 2 months of coming back to the game..<br />
<br />
Making us log in and do an entire raid for a beta key is terrible..</div></div><hr />

Beta testers (as far as I have come across) have been cordial enough to attach spoiler tags to anything they deem a spoiler. It's not like the brief amount of time you are in beta will spoil the game for you. If that is the case, then you clearly have set goals and can accomplish those goals within a month and are done. MMORPG's are not your type of game, I would suggest you take your money and purchase XCOM-2. <br />
<br />
Other than that, lets enjoy the game and enjoy what's to come. :)</div></div><hr />

How will you be contacting ppl?<br />
<br />
After winners are selected the contest status page should be updated to let you know if you won. <br />
<br />
<br />
I love it! Nice contest, but I think it is funny after all the years of telling people to only enter their username/password on the official blizzard site or in game that they are now sponsoring contests that REQUIRE you to give that info to third-party sites, lol.<br />
<br />
Your username and password are never sent to us. You are logging in on Battle.Net.<br />
<br />
<br />
I killed him about 15 minutes ago but contest page says I haven't killed him since contest started. I checked armory and it shows that I killed him. Sucks. :(<br />
<br />
PM me your battletag if it hasn't updated ~15 minutes after pressing the refresh button. Be sure you have logged out of the game before updating. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Your characters are still updating! Refresh this page in a few minutes.&quot; &gt;,&lt; been that way since the start.<br />

Must be Black Temple on the beta because it's 100% Illidan's new model. Google &quot;Illidan Black Temple&quot; and you'll see the old model.</div></div><hr />

To go kill a boss I've killed countless times before, to get the first beta wow invite in the idk 10y+ I've been playing blizzard games :p<br />
<br />
Could mmo champion pls do the next beta key giveaway about something that has been done in the past? It may still be achievable but its really lame to have to go reactivate the account I think. If you really want to only give pple a beta key that actually play wow, I get that!

It's such a prevalent tool lately to promote a website by social networking login tools of that kind that I find it hard to believe this is only for the accuracy of the competition. But anyway, this is only an ethical issue that can't be concluded. I'm interested in more practical terms to what extend that information is shared to other users or moderators, and what kind of information is shared and I have opened a thread in the Feedback forum about it if you're interested.</div></div><hr />

The fact that you continue to pay and I do not does not mean I am not committed. <br />
<br />
For some reason you feel like your monthly subscription entitles you to beta access before any and all others.<br />
<br />
Just because I don't pay them right now does not mean I'm not committed. I've been off and on for 10 years now. I don't feel entitled to beta access.<br />
<br />
Why do you think that not being subbed means I gave up on it? Because I finished what I wanted to do? Because I couldn't find new things to do? Because I was bored by the repetition? Because I was ready for Legion? <br />
<br />
What exactly is it that makes you better than me in Blizzard's eyes and therefore deserving of beta access more than me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying it's the ideal situation, but you can see the conundrum there, no?<br />
<br />
It's really not a waste of a beta key. YOU consider it a waste because it didn't come to someone more &quot;useful&quot;. <br />
<br />
Blizzard will simply add more invites if they don't get the number of people into beta that they want.<br />
<br />
And, no, I don't see a conundrum with that model. The conundrum I see is that someone thinks they are more deserving because they are currently paying.<br />
<br />
My point is that you can't assume that every non-paying person DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY or ISN'T INTERESTED IN THE GAME OVERALL!!<br />
<br />
Blizzard, rightfully so, errors on the forgiving side and assumes that an unsubbed person may in fact decide to sub again, or may still be interested.<br />
<br />
They give us a chance, whereas those that see us as &quot;non-committed&quot; see us as irrelevant and unworthy, compared to their entitled selves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the better way to prevent someone from making 100 MMO-C accounts and using them all.<br />
By having us log in via bnet they can filter out, what I guess is, a non-trivial chunk of people who own multiple accounts here.<br />
It's stupid easy to make an MMO-C account. It's more annoying to make an MMO-C account *and* a bnet account.<br />
<br />
I doubt it's to harvest data since most of that is already open *anyways*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So many people whining about this contest requiring an active subscription and to connect your Blizzard account to MMO Champion is absolutely hilarious! Security is definitely a top priority online, but MMO Champion is 100% legit. It makes the contest fairer as others have already pointed out. There is nothing at all to worry about.<br />
<br />
Currently entered in 3 giveaways ending this week, totalling in around 1,300 beta keys. Hoping I win one this week.</div></div><hr />

We may never know and it doesn't matter. I'd rather people who are playing the game test it before those who gave up on it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard asked us what contests we wanted to run and then gave us keys. No requirements from their end.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do we tell if we win, you send it to the mail or we have to check our mmo account, or what? Thanks for the contest<br />
<br />
Come back and check the contest status page after we select winners. We will make a note at the top of the news when keys are live. <br />
<br />
<br />
this detects only my US account (wich has its time expired) and not my EU account (wich i'm currently playing on) that are on my same BNet account. Can mmo-champion fix this?<br />
<br />
PM me your battletag and I'll look into it. Please check the contest page to be sure it isn't picked up with a forced update first though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah no, I'm not putting my battle net log in information anywhere. What a terrible way to do the contest. Just have people comment on a thread and give them away randomly. Anyone can kill Illidan, it's not a challenge.<br />
<br />
You are putting it in on Battle.Net, but no one is forcing you to enter. Next week will be a lower effort entry. <br />
<br />
<br />
does it make a difference if there is a reset tomorrow?<br />
<br />
Nope, the game records the time of your last kill. As long as you kill him at some point during the contest, you are entered. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why do you want that b.net information of ppl so badly? What are you doing with people's btags and chars?<br />
<br />
Automating the contest so I don't have to manually verify and hand out 500 beta keys.<br />
<br />
<br />
not entering my bnet stuff to anything not blizzard this is a horrible way to do it MMO<br />
<br />
You are entering it on Battle.Net, not MMOC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just did this on two characters. Killed Illidan twice this morning. Updated the list of characters, and it still doesn't show I have killed Illidan since 2015. WTH MMO-Champion? How many times do I have to killed Illidan before the kill counts towards this Beta key contest?<br />
<br />
PM me your battletag and I'll check. <br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I signed in with my B-net last night and it just keeps saying &quot;Your characters are still updating! Refresh this page in a few minutes.&quot; and when i refresh after a while it just keeps saying the same thing<br />
<br />
<br />
ive been trying all day to add my bnet and all i get is Your characters are still updating! Refresh this page in a few minutes.<br />
<br />
something wrong with the servers? looks like i wont b able to entr into this comp.<br />
<br />
A small number of accounts seem to have an error with them, to fix it: <br />
<br />
Try disconnecting MMOC here: https://battle.net/account/managemen...rizations.html and then logging out and in on the contest site. Be sure you disconnect MMOC, as that page is bugged and will always remove the first item on the list, so you have to keep removing applications until it actually removes the right one. After that it will take 24-48 hours to update. If you want, you can PM me your BattleTag when you are done with the steps above and I'll manually force it and check it.</div></div><hr />

Since you're going to insult un-subbed, I figure that makes you fair game.<br />

<br />
The fact that you continue to pay and I do not does not mean I am not committed. <br />
<br />
For some reason you feel like your monthly subscription entitles you to beta access before any and all others.<br />
<br />
Just because I don't pay them right now does not mean I'm not committed. I've been off and on for 10 years now. I don't feel entitled to beta access.<br />
<br />
Why do you think that not being subbed means I gave up on it? Because I finished what I wanted to do? Because I couldn't find new things to do? Because I was bored by the repetition? Because I was ready for Legion? <br />
<br />
What exactly is it that makes you better than me in Blizzard's eyes and therefore deserving of beta access more than me?<br />
<br />
Never said any of the words (except &quot;gave up&quot;) you used in your reply. I was merely stating that paying customers should get first crack. Not sure how that doesn't make sense to you.<br />

I don't think I am better than anyone because I am still subbed, I don't feel entitled to anything. But to me it makes more sense for actual paying customers to have a crack at Beta first.</div></div><hr />

This sentence proves and disproves itself. You say you're not entitled to anything, but then you say paying customers should have a first crack at Beta. <br />

You assume that because I'm not subbed that I'm never going to sub again, therefore I'm not a valuable customer.<br />

<br />
Of course there is a legitimate reason... and you would be championing it if you WERE subbed. There are plenty of capable testers that are paying to participate in the game. Why would you invite people who have already left game?<br />
<br />
If Legion is the logical extension of the game, then it would stand to reason in order to play it, you need to have an active sub. it's new content, buggy or not, and you, like many others, are dying to play it. Hell it should cost a premium...<br />
<br />
Another thought? Put BETA behind an achievement like flight. You must gain some crazy achievement in order to get a beta flag on your account.</div></div><hr />

While YOU would be interested in checking it out, how many people don't even look at their battle.net page anymore to even check? I know when I got into Alpha, I stumbled across my invite by accident when changing accounts. I didn't receive a single email. My husband didn't when he got into Beta. Well if you don't get notification and you're not actively playing, the chances of that player actually participating in the Beta will be much slimmer than those who are actively playing and looking at those boxes that tell you you're in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then those people would be replaced by more invites.<br />
<br />
Beta is about testing, it's not a privilege for anyone. If Blizz invites people that don't want to beta, then they'll invite more people until hey have a pop that they need.<br />

<br />
Of course there is a legitimate reason... and you would be championing it if you WERE subbed. There are plenty of capable testers that are paying to participate in the game. Why would you invite people who have already left game?<br />
<br />
If Legion is the logical extension of the game, then it would stand to reason in order to play it, you need to have an active sub. it's new content, buggy or not, and you, like many others, are dying to play it. Hell it should cost a premium...<br />
<br />
Another thought? Put BETA behind an achievement like flight. You must gain some crazy achievement in order to get a beta flag on your account.<br />
<br />
Now you're getting crazy. It's not a logical extension of the game.<br />
<br />
Just because I'm not currently subbed doesn't mean I'm not going to be in the future.<br />
<br />
Your subscription is not a reason for you to deserve beta.<br />
<br />
And locking beta behind some kind of achievement just makes it exclusive, which completely removes an entire group of people that BETA NEEDS to test.<br />
<br />
The more exclusive and limiting Beta is, the more you hurt the process.<br />
<br />
Why can't you people see that?</div></div><hr />

This is an assumption of yours. One that is not based on any factual evidence other than some random youtubers that are slighted against Blizzard.<br />

Tbh, it -does- make sense they would reward people for remaining subbed.<br />
<br />
It's an incentive for other people to remain subbed in the future too.<br />
<br />
I personally got my alpha / beta invite on a silver platter simply by playing the game and being 13/13M before December 2015. Everyone that played the game and was 13/13M before then got their alpha invite.<br />
<br />
Because only Mythic raiders are dedicated players, right? Damnation upon anyone who doesn't have the time to commit to raiding, or doesn't like to raid.<br />
<br />
No, 13/13 Mythic raiders were invited because they were the most relevant to test raiding content. It wasn't a silver platter reward for dedication.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since there are still a few million playing the game, that is more than enough to act as a pool of potential beta testers. No need to include people who stopped paying. Won't hurt the &quot;testing&quot; process at all. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your subscription is not a reason for you to deserve beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Never said it was... but your NON subscription is a reason NOT to deserve beta.<br />
<br />
But hey.. I'm a kind guy... I wish you the very best of luck in getting some free beta action. I'm sure you are all about the testing and not seeing if you want to &quot;buy the expansion&quot; or not.<br />
<br />
Also... don't worry about your chances... Blizzard is inviting unsubbed peeps. But this particular giveaway isn't held by Blizzard, and requires an active account to complete the requirements to register and be eligible to win.<br />

chaud i'm stuck with &quot;Your characters are still updating! Refresh this page in a few minutes.&quot; since 6 hours<br />

Make sure you are logging out of the toon that did the achievement... and log into another toon. This forces Battle.net to update the previous toon after a few minutes.<br />

<br />
I would compare unsubbed players expecting a beta invite to a convenience store. <br />
<br />
At the grocery store, a loaf of bread is $1.00. <br />
At the convenience store, a loaf of bread is $3.75. <br />
<br />
You're complaining because you don't want to pay the extra $2.75. <br />
You HAVE a grocery store, in this sense, just having opt'd for beta access. <br />
If you want a convenient loaf of bread, you have to pay the convenience store price.<br />
<br />
I personally do not mind if I do or do not get a beta invite. I've never been invited excluding buying my own way via D3. I have a marvelous computer from ibuypower that I bought exclusively for WoW and I own all Blizzard games excluding Overwatch. I have received beta keys for other games that I'm not nearly as interested in as WoW, but I'm an adult and I understand that not everyone gets their way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you got into Alpha because you were the most appropriate to test Raiding.<br />
<br />
My incentive to remain subbed should include new content. Since the drought, I and many others (According to sub numbers) have back off from paying them for a year of nothing new. <br />
<br />
Your &quot;loyalty&quot; by getting 13/13M and for remaining subbed has earned you the right to continue playing the game. Oh, wait... that's not even true. You're money every month is what has earned you the right to keep playing.<br />
<br />
Happily and fortunately for me, Blizzard sees the value there is to include non-subbed into beta.<br />

3 words for you: Get Over It.<br />

I don't know what that means.<br />
<br />
I've entered other competitions. I have no qualms with a competition that is exclusive to people that are currently subbed. There's nothing to get over.<br />
<br />
I take issue to people that think beta should be ONLY for subbed.<br />

That isn't the Blizzard I know or have personal experience with. The way I've experienced them in the past is that they give much more rewards to those who pay them a lot more money consistently. For example: I've gotten several character services for free, because I've spent a certain amount of money. (And shortly after also beta invites to some of their most recent games)<br />
<br />
You don't /know/ what Blizzard agrees or doesn't agree with anyhow, but what you're claiming is opposite of the Blizzard I've personal and financial experience with.<br />
<br />
Like what, exactly? I'm curious.</div></div><hr />
