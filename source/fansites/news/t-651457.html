But<br />
Take all that off the front page and give the few that are interested a link.Some with slow net connections will have to wait for ages to see what the hell is going on, and all they will see is a bunch of nerds playing games. If I wanted to do that, I'd set up a video camera next to me.<br />
<br />
No my connection isn't slow, but it did take a noticeable extra time to load the front page of MMO.</div></div><hr />

I can't even do anything on the main page because I'm forced to install this Octoshape addon. When I click No thanks, it just takes me to the EULA and nothing else. I either close the window or go back and have the same page-encompassing popup to install the addon. As Shinshiva said, link it, don't shove it in our faces. If this is going to go on all weekend, looks like I'll avoid this site like the plague until Monday.<br />
<br />
And it's ColUmbus, not Colombus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the vast majority of users don't have a problem with that. What users can have a problem with is when a site embeds code (either ads, or this promo) that forces you to either install some jar that many don't know what it does, and half the time when you try not to (either because you are untrusting of this kind of app, or just not interested in the competitive arenas), locks the entire browser down, or the tab making the entire site unusable at all (even if you want to watch the stream).<br />
<br />
Weither or not the language used in the posts above is complaining or not, users are forced to choose between using a site they regular and having to install a bunch of stuff that is unsolicited ahead of time (via just posting the stream as a link) or avoiding the site entirely until the event is over if the streaming app isn't working correctly.</div></div><hr />

To all those who are against this being posted... MMO-Champion is owned by the MLG as Boubouille has pointed out many times in interviews. <br />
<br />
Without their support the site would be slower, news would be updated slower, less features... so you should be able to endure roughly one sponsorship post a week for all the benefits this site provides. Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean they have to put absolute shit up with a no button that does absolutely NOTHING!<br />

I registered now just to show how much I despise this behavior. I have no problem with the occasional ad, or a news post detailing some new deal from MLG, but to fuck up the whole site so I can only get on by using direct links into the forums and navigate from there, is really disappointing.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't change the fact that it totally breaks the site in FF. I use FF for a reason, namely, IE is a piece of shit junk...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all seriousness, Firefox has a 28% share of the browser market. MLG is contracting an addon that won't work with 1 out of every 4 users? And that's probably skewed more towards Firefox as (I'd like to think) the WoW community is more savvy than just one out of 4 users using Firefox.<br />
<br />
Apparently this is a series of competitions for MLG. If this is going to be mainpaged every time it happens, I may just go back to WoR for my WoW news.<br />
<br />
I made a bookmark for myself for the weekend directly to the forums since this shit is still main paged. Even a new temp main page would suffice with a giant MLG ad that takes you to the addon would be nice, with a HTML, working No thanks under it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And I agree totally. While this stream isn't using WMV stream, the IE functionality is generally higher due to licenses in Windows bound platforms.<br />
Some even deliberatly block FF. To end on a happy note some pages block IE. :)</div></div><hr />

Take all that off the front page and give the few that are interested a link.Some with slow net connections will have to wait for ages to see what the hell is going on, and all they will see is a bunch of nerds playing games. If I wanted to do that, I'd set up a video camera next to me.<br />

<br />
Being a PvE player myself, and really really casual at PvP, I decided to watch some of the games here, and I really don't understand who on this planet though that World of Warcraft is a great spectator game to be broadcast around. If you're not playing the game you don't know a single thing what going on on the screen. Even I and my wife have problems understanding everything whats going on at the same time. <br />
<br />
The Blizzard UI or whatever is used there for the spectators is really abysmal at best too, and the whole presentation of the game as a whole. Let's just put it that way; There are certain aspects that could be fixed to make it more enjoyable, for example identifying the player and teams better on the spectator UI, not having players wear nearly the same colored flags could be a start, especially for people like me who are a little colorblind. But that's up to Blizzard so no point discussing this here. <br />
<br />
Another thing, those matches are so short, once you get into it, it's already over. I know how things go in WoW, and this is what it is, but seriously how can this entertain anyone is beyond me. Basically what I was watching the past hour or so was 10 minutes of gameplay and 50 minutes of commercials or staring at the desks of players - and come to think that someone might want to pay to see this is really beyond me. <br />
<br />
WoW is a fine game, it's decently competitive, but I had seriously more fun watching Gears of War or Halo 3 yesterday for 5 minutes each as the one hour spent on this WoW cast. <br />
<br />
But that's not dissing the tournament, organizers and casters, great job done there, I just think, WoW isn't for this kind of stuff (spectator wise). <br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />
