Patch 6.2 - Gnome Character Selection Screen Changes<br />
Patch 6.2 adds some more detail to the Gnome character selection screen.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 6.2 Preview - Pets Galore<br />
As we continue to explore new territory in Draenor, it should come as no surprise that new battle pets and new battle pet rewards will be found. Thus far, Draenor has contained a great deal of diversity for pet battlers, and Patch 6.2 will be no different. Let’s take a look at some of what’s in store for your collection.<br />
<br />
Please note: Spoilers are ahead! If you want to discover the new battle pets and rewards for yourself, don’t read any further!<br />
<br />
Tanaan Stop Action<br />
First and foremost, Tanaan Jungle is where the action can be found on all fronts. You will find battle pets of all types dotting the landscape, four of which are new and just waiting to be caught for the first time:<br />
<br />
<br />
Bloodbeak (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/85388-bloodbeak)<br />
Cerulean Moth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88422-cerulean-moth)<br />
Violet Firefly (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88357-violet-firefly)<br />
Fen Crab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88473-fen-crab)<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out for the new quest “A Fel Puppy Of My Own (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38428-a-fel-puppy-of-my-own)”, through which you can acquire the delightful new Fel Pup (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/91823-fel-pup).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/thumb/petPreview01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/petPreview01.jpg) <br />
<br />
But the jungle doesn’t only provide garden-variety battle pets. If you look carefully, you’ll find that there are 15 fel-corrupted legendary pets scattered throughout Tanaan. Your Pet Battle Master in your garrison will have some new information for you to get started. You can only defeat any of these legendaries once per day, and when you do, you’ll receive a container of Fel-Touched Pet Supplies (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127751-fel-touched-pet-supplies), which will include:<br />
<br />
<br />
Gold<br />
Pet Charms<br />
Pet Bandages<br />
<br />
<br />
And has a small chance to include:<br />
<br />
<br />
A Fel-Touched Battle-Training Stone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127755-fel-touched-battle-training-stone) (single use, grants +5 pet levels)<br />
One of these rare pets:<br />
<br />
Periwinkle Calf (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/93352-periwinkle-calf)<br />
Zangar Spore (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/86715-zangar-spore)<br />
Seaborne Spore (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/86718-seaborne-spore)<br />
Nightmare Bell (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/93483-nightmare-bell)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We’ve also got a new achievement for you when you defeat all 15 legendary opponents in Tanaan Jungle.<br />
<br />
You’re Too Charming<br />
Patch 6.2 is going to introduce a new vendor to your level 3 Garrison Menagerie. Tiffy Trapspring (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/94512-tiffy-trapspring) and Giada Goldleash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/94516-giada-goldleash) have been attracted to your impressive stash of Pet Charms, and want to take them off your hands in exchange for the following pets:<br />
<br />
Dusty Sporewing (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88415-dusty-sporewing)<br />
Bloodthorn Hatchling (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88514-bloodthorn-hatchling)<br />
Glowing Sporebat (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88575-glowing-sporebat)<br />
Lost Netherpup (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/93142-lost-netherpup)<br />
<br />
<br />
And the following toys:<br />
<br />
Magic Pet Mirror (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127696-magic-pet-mirror)<br />
Indestructible Bone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127707-indestructible-bone)<br />
Spirit Wand (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127695-spirit-wand)<br />
<br />
<br />
And the Hunt Continues<br />
A number of new battle pets coming to World of Warcraft with patch 6.2 can be found all over the worlds. Back home in Azeroth, adventurers will cheer when they find the non-combative Nethaera's Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/93432-nethaeras-light) glowing in Dalaran. Meanwhile, two new fishing pets are turning up at the Darkmoon Faire. One is called Blorp (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/93814-blorp) (also a non-combat pet), and the other is the wondrous Ghostshell Crab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/93808-ghostshell-crab).<br />
<br />

<br />
Even more pets have found their way to the fields of battle on Draenor. Look carefully, and you may find:<br />
<br />
Crimsonwing Moth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88413-crimsonwing-moth) -- A rare spawn in Talador with many spawn points, and only one ever appearing in the zone at a time.<br />
Sapphire Firefly (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/88356-sapphire-firefly) – A rare spawn in Spires of Arak who also has many spawn points and appears only once at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cinder Pup (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/93143-cinder-pup) – Available from a new Garrison mission in patch 6.2.<br />
Corrupted Nest Guardian (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/94623-corrupted-nest-guardian) – Dropped by Shadow Lord Iskar in the new Hellfire Citadel raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get a first look at all of the above by testing Patch 6.2 with us on the PTR. Please note that availability to test some PTR content may be limited to certain time frames. Learn more about the upcoming Patch 6.2 and how to participate on the PTR in our 6.2 PTR Patch Notes (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18539917/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Loot Changes and Drop Rates<br />
The first part of the text explains that, like today, if 15 people are elegible to loot, 3 items will drop in Group Loot. Present personal loot doesn't work this way, it can drop nothing or more than 3, with an average of 3 considering all wow population. Now the game will reward 3 players with loot in personal loot.<br />
In addition, to compensate the fact that loot can't be redistributed, MORE loot than that 3 loot will be given, say, 4 loot.<br />
This is an accurate summary. <br />
<br />
We don't usually provide exact drop percentages, and we're still tweaking the bonus when using Personal Loot in 6.2, but I can say that objectively:<br />
<br />
More items will drop on average for a raid using 6.2 Personal Loot than would have dropped using 6.0/6.1 Personal Loot.<br />
More items will drop on average for a raid using 6.2 Personal Loot than would drop for that raid using any form of Group Loot (Master, Need/Greed, etc.).<br />
<br />
<br />
Shop Mounts Feedback<br />
Mounts take a fairly significant amount of time to create, and in this case the Runesaber mount was made somewhere in the 6.0 production timeframe, and I believe was complete before 6.1 hit the PTR. Creation of store mounts is intentionally consistent and takes place months before they actually release. In this case we actually waited for a bit as we wanted to ensure the Token rollout went smoothly without adding in the potential complications of a store mount going live at the same time. In short: we didn't crank this thing out yesterday as an answer to something. Production takes a long time, and we have them on a regular release cadence. You can be certain than every few months there will be a new store mount.<br />
<br />
As for why we make mounts for the store at all: most obviously of course because there is a significant portion of players that like being able to purchase cosmetic items for real money. Certainly there is also a desire by a significant portion of players to be able to obtain the Ironhoof Destroyer from Mythic Blackhand. Not everyone will be able to, or maybe even want to, obtain either mount, but we know that a wide variety of players look for a wide variety of acquisition methods for cosmetic items. Also certainly different players will look differently at these two mounts based on their acquisition methods, and it's the main reason why we don't mix game and store mounts. If someone buys a mount off the Shop we don't want there to then be confusion as to whether it's the Shop version, or a recolor obtained through in-game means. We essentially purposely ensure shop mounts stand out as shop mounts.<br />
<br />
I do concur with the original poster that what people want is more in-game content and that a mount is not sufficient to that want.<br />
Yeah, of course no one said &quot;people want more content! let's make a mount!&quot; and that was sort of my point, these will release regularly regardless and aren't tied to other game content.<br />
<br />
Also, of course, the crux of the complaint isn't really (I believe) that this mount exists, but just that some people think it's poor timing to be selling something while they're looking for a new raid tier, etc. I don't think there's anything anyone can say to that except for us to just keep working on and release the content they're looking for. But in any case, I thought I'd try to offer a reasoned response as to how this mount is not an answer to anything, but just a standard timed release like all the other ones before it.<br />
<br />
you are telling me, that to get the nicest mounts in the game, i have to buy it with real money? and i can count on them coming out with frequency?<br />
No, I did not say that, and gave an example of the Mythic Blackhand mount also offering a rare and difficult to obtain mount. Judging by reaction to some of the store mounts, I would argue they are not at all the nicest looking mounts in the game. Certainly all of the most sought after mounts are valued due to their rarity, and store bought mounts are generally not very rare. Value will differ from person to person though, I suspect.<br />
<br />
You say they take a long time to create and ok that makes sense, however I think what people are getting at is the &quot;nice mounts&quot; more or less have to be bought.<br />
I don't believe there was much if any difference in production time between a shop mount and, say, the Vicious War Kodo in 6.2. Or the mechanostrider for that matter. Or Felsteel Annihilator. You could argue they're all &quot;reskins&quot; in that they use existing animation sets, but all three are new mounts with custom geometry and textures available through gameplay. Whether you think they're as cool or not is probably up to personal preference.<br />
<br />
its very frustrating to hear blizzard take this stance on mounts. suddenly mounts are such a big production... like wrath and bc didn't happen.<br />
The art in the game is overall of much higher polygon and texture resolution than it was. Production &quot;costs&quot; (e.g. time) only increase as we increase graphical fidelity. Not to mention huge and ambitious projects like updating 20 race models, all with updated customization options, new animation sets, etc. This expansion has a huge amount of very time and quality-control intensive art in it. But I do legitimately understand it's sometimes difficult to see the forest for the trees.<br />
<br />
Condescension. Nice.<br />
I'm not intentionally condescending anyone, and I understand the desire to turn this into a battle against us. But I really don't think that's necessary, or productive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Burning Crusade Timewalking - Feedback/Bugs<br />
I'm making a new thread to focus feedback on the current PTR build and subsequent ones. <br />
<br />
Burning Crusade Timewalking is now open, and will remain so for a while. Since the last time we tested this system, we've fixed a number of scaling bugs. Doing so necessitating clearing a large number of buffs from players when entering Timewalking dungeons, as we do with Arenas, Challenge Modes, and some other content.<br />
<br />
Please queue up and check out the dungeons. On the encounter side, we remain interested in experiential feedback regarding clear times, and any outliers that felt excessively easy or excessively hard. On the systems side, we're curious to hear whether there are effects that get canceled upon entering that are particularly annoying to lose (we've tried to preserve cosmetic buffs, and core effects like stances), and whether any effects or abilities seem like they aren't scaling properly even after our latest changes.<br />
<br />
In particular, logs (or just damage meter screenshots) are very helpful in identifying problem cases - in general, we'd expect to see DPS values in the 1500-2000 range from scaled-down players doing this content. Some burst timers and abilities may cause spikes well in excess of these values, but overall that's roughly what things are tuned for currently. If you or a groupmate is consistently doing significantly more than that range, something may be wrong and we'd appreciate data to help us track down exactly what.<br />

Tusks of Mannoroth... still in game?<br />
Yes, and they are still very rare. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/597920165599162369))<br />
<br />
We don't currently allow transmog to &quot;invisible&quot; items. It's an aesthetic choice we've made, but we understand the common feedback. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598245867804434432))<br />
at the risk of losing my favorite xmog piece. This makes no sense because the dk belt from the starting zone is invis<br />

Flying<br />
Would be cool if you could answer the question. Will flying return in 6.2? Yes, no, or &quot;can't say&quot;.<br />
It's not my place to say, sorry (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/597836287723315202))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
i thought for WoD you guys made LFR flexible? I tried queuing in with 30 people and it didnt let me do it<br />
Queuing for LFR is still a 25-player thing, but if people drop the content scales down so you needn't wait for backfills. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/597837232406405122))<br />
<br />
Will Mythic dung lock you to instance with bosses dead like a Mythic raid? Can I help friend do one I have completed already?<br />
Mythic dungeons have a weekly loot lockout, but you can help friends if you’ve already gotten your loot for the week. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/597920636573384704))<br />
<br />
Any chance you guys could tweak the spines of deathwing fight to be a little more solo friendly?<br />
We don't have any plans currently to go back and alter this encounter. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598234506772946944))<br />

Can achievements be done in Timewalking dungeons, and can the Blue Proto Drake drop in that difficulty?<br />
Yes to both. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598255827321946112))<br />

Any chance you're removing the WoD crafted limit in 6.2? Could be a good catchup mechanic for those who have the mats<br />
We will not be removing this limitation, however, we are adding new tiers of crafted gear. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/597920477474988032))<br />

Misc<br />
The artists are the real heroes when it comes to icons. Designers are just annoying and picky about them.<br />
&quot;I want a brick! A magic brick! No, FOUR magic bricks! They have to be all cool and like *explosive hand gesture*&quot; (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/597863185127997440))<br />
Then we get the icons, and we're like, &quot;No, that's not what I wanted. READ MY MIND!&quot;<br />
*Sends back terrible, indecipherable MS Paint picture* LIKE THIS (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/597865231268872192))<br />
<br />
why is it up to the players to tell you how to implement it? Don't you collect a check for game design?<br />
Should we never ask players their opinions on how they'd like to see something show up in-game? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/597907327484825600))<br />
<br />
My point is I'd like Blizzard to act like the old Blizzard and be honest with it's customers like it use to.<br />
Well I'm just one rando dude, and usually ask questions I'm personally interested in. What do you feel has been dishonest? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/597920883248898048))<br />
not just give an answer. If you don't want us anymore, please just tell us and we can bring peace to Wow.<br />
It may seem like indiv. devs are trolling by not responding, but it's just not something our personal accts should address (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/597922652137861120))<br />
<br />
I like it how blizzard replies mostly to positive feedbacks esp on pvp but ignores the &quot;negative&quot; ones @WarcraftDevs<br />
We take all feedback into consideration. Whether or not we reply publicly has little to do with that. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598228369004625920))<br />
<br />
When to expect more Developer interviews or Q&amp;A?<br />
We'll be setting some up as we get closer to 6.2 release, but don't have dates to share yet. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598233594121703424))<br />

<br />
Like they said,for most people the value of a mount is partly based on its rarity.Having a mount from the shop is nothing special,everybody can get it,it just show you have extra money to spend on such things.</div></div><hr />

Quote of the day. This so much. there is literally NO reason to bash for a bloody mount when you don't have to buy it. alot of the negative people nowadays are just doing it beacuse its trendy.<br />
<br />
Let's get real here, You know why its not necessary? beacuse no matter how much those few rage about &quot;buhu purdy mount in cashshop&quot;, blizzard wont give a shit. They are a company and the point is incase you missed it is to earn money.

Let's get real here, You know why its not necessary? beacuse no matter how much those few rage about &quot;buhu purdy mount in cashshop&quot;, blizzard wont give a shit.

Or y'know, because the shop mount got a cool looking, semi new mount with extra model elements, while the achievement mount for HFC is a WOLF with orange claws, that's it, no bells, whistles, or even a kazoo pop.<br />
<br />
Or that Alliance Trading Post gets a unique Iron Horde Elekk, while the Horde gets...a fucking wolf, and the Grinning Reaver becomes a shop mount, despite the Laughing Skull being our Trading post faction. I normally defend Blizzards actions, but given that, can you see why people might be annoyed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They take a significant amount of time to create... but aren't done so on anywhere near the same schedule. Notice how store mounts are datamined months and often several patches in advance. The collector's edition mount sat in the game files for like, a year. The fey dragon was in the game files for at least four or five months. <br />
<br />
So they might take more time... but they can spend more time on them. They don't need to ship them with patches, like they do all the other mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
When was the last time an in-game mount was just smashed in between patches? Never. Not even back in &quot;glorious BC.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Right!! and everyone is Bring up the damn mounts. all i want is more for the pvp communtiy. we make up half of this game and we get nothing. its all about raiders/mounts/pets/garrisons/everything else but Pvp. we dont ask for a lot any way i mean New arena or few bg's. i think they should bring back the old pvp ranking system Scout ect.. so raiders stay raiding and pvpers pvp. they are making it to easy for everyone to do everything now days. do you know how fast we would be kicked out for wearing pvp eilte gear to raids but yet its okay for raiders to wear pve gear in a bg nice! that system works.</div></div><hr />

Regardless. Blizzard has reused models for mount reskins since the game came out.<br />
<br />
I think people just want a lot of options for their mounts. Right now if you don't buy store mounts you just have the option of either getting a very small amount of &quot;rare&quot; mobs by either being a hardcore raider or being having ridiculous luck with spawns or the world boss. Other than that there's just a million recolors of 4-5 boring animal mounts without running animations.<br />
<br />
Compare to say TBC where you got a unique model from Cenarion Expedition (if you're horde), a unique model from the Netherwings, a unique model from Sha'tari. All mounts you could just work on getting, not relying on luck or forcing you to be a hardcore raider. In WoD every faction mount, even the LW mount, is just a recolor. You could go with Blizzard's explanation that it takes longer to develop more detailed mounts, but their team is so much bigger now than back then, and there's plenty of animals in the Draenor wilds they could simply modify to mounts.</div></div><hr />

The talbuk looks like it's floating, the wolf looks like it's got some kind of horrible hip displacement. Because they couldn't be assed to animate them properly, it's like that with all the WoD mounts, they're a complete shitshow and it should've been fixed by now.<br />
<br />
I don't give a shit about the store mounts looking way cooler or whatever. But when the store mounts work, and the ingame mounts don't, UHHHHHHHHHHHHH there's a problem there, don't you think? Blizz is just completely out of touch with the people that pay their bills. Even if the next expac is the greatest ever, they've done enough with WoD to screw up their reputation enough that most people just don't have faith in them anymore.

<br />
The amount of effort that goes into making the store mounts is far and wide greater than any of the mounts that can be acquired in game. Few store mounts have in game counterparts that are attainable while nearly everything they release in game is a reskin with a saddle tacked.<br />
<br />
I was subbed for years and enjoyed the game, once MoP ended my sub ran out and I never renewed. You know what they did? They realized they lost a paying customer and to get me back gave me the WoD collectors edition + 5 months game time. Once that gametime runs out I'm still not going to resub, the extra 5 months they gave me only soured my impression of the game further.<br />
<br />
This game used to be great, but they've squandered all its potential in favor of milking the loyalty of their customers. I'm glad ghostcrawler got out while he did, he was always a respectable dude despite the hate on him. Now that he's gone I think we can all agree the game has spiraled into a cesspit that he was the buffer against.<br />

The Blackhand mount does nothing for me. I absolutely love how the Runesaber looks and plan to buy it as soon as I've got the money.

I think it's pretty obvious that flying won't be back in 6.2, which is why I finally pulled the plug on my sub. I'll come back when I can fly and there's something interesting to do.<br />
<br />

So the price should be more like $10. Won't even consider buying it until we get flying back... and it sure looks like they will never give us flying while Draenor is current, so NO SALE.<br />
<br />
Not to mention it also is looking like they were simply stringing us along all this xpac, kinda making it seem like they MAY give us this function while never actually intending to give it to us. Kinda like we got the not so high because we can't fly, hard one...</div></div><hr />

As it relates to Draenor, what interesting things would you be able to do with flying? Genuine question. Is it merely the freedom that flight gives you?<br />

I agree there is value in getting from point A to B more directly. But what other (personal?) value would there be in flying in Draenor?</div></div><hr />

Mhm, they're nowhere close to half. This is a pve game, pvp is a mini game tacked on. Hell more people pet battle than pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the right answer.<br />
<br />
There is so much beauty in WoW's zones that you can't truly appreciate it when you are stuck on the ground. Plus I like the freedom to explore.<br />
<br />
I've said it 100 times if I've said it once:<br />
<br />
- Require Fuel to fly (Food for beast mounts and Fuel for mechanical bits)<br />
- Patrolling NPC's[NOT GUARDS, think of that giant dragon that patrolled the shrines) that can knock you off your mount. Just like we shouldn't AFK were Mobs are on the ground, we shouldn't AFK in the skys.<br />
- Ability to have Air-to-Air combat and knock people off their mounts if they are flagged PvP.<br />

We live in a world where GTA V exists, where Witcher 3 exists. But to reskin a Vanilla Cat mount, or whatever it is, is suddenly akin to carving out Mount Rushmore.<br />

Unfortunately there is a lot of uneducated fanboys that will believe their blatant lies. Higher poly counts does not translate to more time needed to create them, they sculpt these models in zbrush at very high poly counts and with a lot of detail, then they use various methods to bake that detail in to a texture, the only difference between a high poly and low poly model is the point at which they decide to put details into the textures. So they can make good looking amounts in around the same time they did in BC, now they maybe add more items and fluff to them which does add a small amount of time, but higher quality models do not, and it's not enough to warrant double dipping. Considering their pipeline and priorities it might take like 2-3 weeks to create a store mount with some of that time being people working on things they have to get done first or waiting for input from higher ups or whatever. But that's going from 1 concept artist, to 1 modeller, to 1 animator/1 texture artist before being finalized, it's really not a big deal for such a large development team to make mounts.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they make it as if the creation of mount is such a big deal... like literally comparable to making a video game with nearly real life graphics.<br />
Ubisoft is able to release one Assassin's Creed game a year, each one with new assets. Blizz tho? It takes them that much time to create a meh mount reminding us of early 2000s and they are SO proud of it.<br />
They look like rookies. And it's laughable.</div></div><hr />

Flying gave me a freedom to fully explore the land below, to land on a mountain top I would never be able to reach land bound. There is much in WoD I have not seen as I have no desire to gallop off into the sunset. I too stop to hover over pretty landmarks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm. <br />
<br />
GTA V took 5 years and 350 people to develop. <br />
<br />
Witcher 3 was created by Projekt RED, with 450 dedicated to only one title, and two year's development, based on the REDengine, which according to everything I've read, helps create worlds like they did quickly and efficiently. <br />
<br />
Wow's team, in the Wrath era, was 37 people. <br />
<br />
Yes, 37.<br />
<br />
http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/17/agdc09-blizzard-talks-about-world-behind-warcraft/<br />

Granted, the numbers are undoubtedly different now...but 37 people did Wrath, over two years. I've read that the dev team went up to 167 for Cata, but I can't find an official source for that. Throw in at least 50% from the Titan collapse and new hires. I'd bet they're up to 250 people at this point, at least. And in two years, longer than Wrath's development time, with 5 times the man power...<br />
<br />
Yeah, I can't go on. It's just bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What annoys me about this GM is that he's not even answering the complaints of people. people asking about unique and cool mounts only available in the shop, and he comes back saying we can get kodo #86 and wolf #214. I've seen the GM's give some shit responses, but this takes the cake.</div></div><hr />

Well, boy howdy, they're still in the game. <br />
<br />
Most people don't have a problem with cool-looking, rare mounts for the high-end raiders.<br />
The question is though, where are the cool-looking, not-so-rare mounts for the rest of us? Only available through the shop?<br />
That used to be different.<br />

Flying<br />
Would be cool if you could answer the question. Will flying return in 6.2? Yes, no, or &quot;can't say&quot;.<br />
It's not my place to say, sorry (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/597836287723315202))<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are they so vague about that? If they don't like flying and the majority of the players don't like flying then why not simply say &quot;No flying in WoD&quot;?</div></div><hr />

This is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard in all my time playing video games on PC. During the golden years of player mods with Quake, Half-Life, and Unreal games models and reskins were saturating the market and they were all done on free time.<br />
<br />
This is just amateur Graphic Art / Art graduate projections. Self-inserting their pay entitlement for their &quot;work&quot; because they're too stupid to learn applicable field skills or research existing methodology. They just throw money at products that to do the work for them and put their stamp on it.<br />
<br />
Are they still pretending the model updates are even acceptable? Especially the animations?<br />
<br />
Now WoW team is supposedly &quot;bigger&quot; for WoD, yet we've seen nothing out of it. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.<br />
<br />
We constantly see excuses about production costs/time when none of it is real. It's not. It's just them nickel and diming players. Beating a dead horse for every last penny they can get.<br />

Or that Alliance Trading Post gets a unique Iron Horde Elekk, while the Horde gets...a fucking wolf, and the Grinning Reaver becomes a shop mount, despite the Laughing Skull being our Trading post faction. I normally defend Blizzards actions, but given that, can you see why people might be annoyed?<br />

At least your trading post transmog items are cosmetic. Ours are restricted to plate only, which fucking sucks, cause it's one of the few nice looking draeneic sets avaliable outside the raids.</div></div><hr />

Let me get this straight you are comparing the time/money to reskin a existing model of a 90's game to Blizzard making a new mount in 2015 Warcraft? lol<br />
There is basically no comparing even wow's old models cost and time of the early 2000's to the amount of time and cost of models we have today.<br />
<br />
I want to point you to this article i'll take a quote from: <br />
Epic's first next-gen tech demo, a 2011 clip called Samaritan that showed off Direct X 11 technology in a modified version of Unreal Engine 3. While Sweeney said Epic was enthusiastic about the results, the company was “greatly worried” about the cost. Although the clip was just under three minutes in length, it took four months and a team of 30 people to create. <br />

yep, completely NOT true. there are items (eg the belt of the DK, fistweapons for monks and a few others) that DO turn the gfx invis. so... trying to sell us it's COMPLETELY intentional that the transmog set (monk shoulders) are not transmoggable, is quite and frankly a lazy excuse for an error they couldn't find.<br />

lemme guess, like UD fistweapons you will need another 6 addons / 10 years to fix it?</div></div><hr />
