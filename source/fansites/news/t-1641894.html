<br />
Hello and welcome to the Blood Elf edition of Artcraft! We know that many of you have been waiting for this update, so I’ll just provide some quick background and then get straight into the imagery.<br />
<br />
We’re aware that it’s not ideal to see a mix of older player character models next to newer player character models, especially when you happen to be a player of the Blood Elf variety—and we’re working as diligently to remedy that situation as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality. We don’t have an exact ETA for when you’ll see these in-game, but we’re happy with the direction of this update with regards to the model and textures; we’re now focusing on model and texture variations, as well as rigging and animating. We’ve streamlined the process quite a bit, so hopefully (knock on wood) those things will go smoothly and we’ll be able to roll these out quickly.<br />
<br />
Senior Artist Dusty Nolting is focusing on the female model—here are his thoughts:<br />
<br />
The Horde has classically been about brutes, blood, and thunder. The Blood Elves bring a bit of subtlety to the Horde, and I think that was one of the most important aspects of the Blood Elves to maintain. For the female specifically, something we did often was move things around in small but deliberate increments, to make sure everything was just right. It’s the delicate details like her nose shape or fingertips that represent the most challenging parts of upgrading the female.<br />
<br />
Senior Artist Joe Keller is focusing on the Blood Elf male model. Here’s what he had to say about his approach:<br />
<br />
The male Blood Elf already has a lot of character with his easily recognizable pose and stylish hair. Our update just gives us a chance to define and focus on that. His anatomy, facial features, and hair will all get an update while still maintaining his iconic look, bringing him to the level of the other new character models.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to check out where we are with these updates. We’re excited to get these models in the game, and are working hard to make that happen as quickly as possible—though as ever, quality is paramount, and presenting the best, most highly polished work we can will always come first. <br />
<br />
Thank you, and Shorel’aran!</div></div><hr />

Exactly what I thought. Her face is too &quot;long&quot;, sort of lama like. The rest looks fine though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She actually looks more athletic and less anorexic in the update thanks to more muscle shading, so I'm actually pretty impressed as far as the updates go.<br />
<br />
That specific face looks terrible though, really uncomfortable looking face, likely better animated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do worry about the female face. The nose seems too long, the chin a bit too low. Might just be the angle. I won't be comfortable until I can see them in game.<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to say that the male ass looks very nice too.</div></div><hr />

Ae you looking at the image correctly? for example, look at the female. Her feet, her weight, her face, hair, all of it is much better. Plus blood elfs were already pretty. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blithe</div><div class="date">2014-11-25, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love them - they're one of the few races that actually stayed true to the goal of the model change by looking exactly like the old ones but much more high resolution. The hair just looks amazing as well, and I'm glad they kept the postures and stances. I'm hoping that they don't ruin it all with a bouncy animation like the Female Night Elf, or make them really rigid and stiff like the Female Troll either.<br />
<br />
Also, why are people confusing sophistication with metrosexuality? The Male Blood Elf is fine and (so far) completely lives up to every expectation.</div></div><hr />

They changed the body of the female a bit,and it looks good imo. They added just a lil muscle there to look fine but keep them slip as they should be. The face also looks good but needs a bit of work, looks a bit &quot;long&quot; <br />
<br />
Overall for such a early preview i think they did a good job.</div></div><hr />

Blood elves are the most popular horde race. Its smart to leave their base look the same. I dont care for the way the male stands either, but they would be dumb to change it. People expect to much from these. Does it look HD? Yes, it does. Mission accomplished.</div></div><hr />

The stance is very exaggerated though, and it'd be fine to just make it less spine-breaking and just soften it. You know, soften it a bit, make it a bit more subtle. I love my belves. A lot. But even I think the male stance needs a fix. The female got one, and it looks a looooot better.

They said plenty of times that the blood elf model update would be similar to the Draenei, the older races (Night Elves, Humans, Orcs, Forsaken) were more drastic because they've been around since the beginning, whereas Draenei and Blood elves were already updated in comparison, so there was never going to be a drastic change here, ever.</div></div><hr />

Yes but bear in mind they have corrected bad posture/animations for other races. Not always successfully. Their chests do look flatter now, and the animations are (as they say) WIP, so we may yet see the bad posture fixed.</div></div><hr />

I don't get why this is such a popular request. When I look at human female the word &quot;styrofoam&quot; pops through my mind, as I'm convinced there is no other way she'd be able to swing such things. Female blood elves are really delicate in size, so their weapons should be too.<br />

To be fair, none of the females could wield the weapons that are given to them realistically. Nor could the males. They're not built in a practical way. But then it's fantasy, and most of the classes make heavy use of magic and enchants, so that should outweigh this problem. If you notice, it's mostly the end-game stuff that has the most whimsical appearances, probably because powerful characters alone could wield it effectively.</div></div><hr />

The males look amazing, however. I just don't understand why you can center male faces correctly, but can't do a female's justice. <br />

The female's face looks weird though. Almost like her chin is jutting out too much. Hopefully she looks better when she's fully animated and rigged.<br />

Well, with the garrisons (in their current form) now confined to WoD, I am less concerned about the faction (yes, I really dislike the Horde garrison.) I do think they'll take the feedback about the posture into account, though it is bizarre that they have not done so already when this is the biggest sticking point about the BE male model to most people. They succeeded on every other count, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bear in mind they're not that identical as you may think, as the BE female posture, for instance, is different and straighter than it was before. The males look a wee bit more upright, with flatter chests, but I still think the shoulders roll back too far and could do with some coming forward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking most of the negative posters aren't people who are playing that often, nor are they a fan of the female form. That being said, the sheer amount of work into improving these races was impressive. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but at the same time I don't think everyone needs to share it. The old saying goes, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. Even on an intellectual level, if you want to say something is &quot;ugly&quot; then offer critique of the body as a whole and how you find it ugly.<br />
<br />
What I think you'll come to note is that people all have tastes they want met, and the opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one, and everyone think's everyone else's stinks, lol.<br />

There kind of is really. Why exactly are they &quot;horrible&quot;, what aesthetic reasoning's do you have for your statement?<br />

ITT: People mad that Blizzard made it quite clear that there will be HD updates of character models, not completely redone models...and got exactly that.<br />

That is the exact opposite of what I hoped would happen. <br />

I was hoping the male Belf would at least stand a bit more straight T_T ...<br />

My hopes are now that they've at least reduced the ''breathing-animation'' intensity on the Belf Males. So that it doesn't look like they're having a heart attack 24/7 anymore.</div></div><hr />

The first models were an update and didn't stick to their original design where the original design was flawed (orc, gnome, dwarf). Some of the latter ones just seem rushed.</div></div><hr />

The picture shows both the old and new models side by side. The one with the big feet is the old model.</div></div><hr />

Yeah i guess this statement can be true, Night Elves especially. But the vanilla models are a different kettle of fish, they REALLY needed to have an overhaul, and personally on the whole im happy with the work that was done. could more time and attention to retaining the old looks be done with some of the Vanilla ones?, sure, but the Dwarf, Tauren, Undead models are pretty bang on to the old ones off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Blood Elf and Draenei BC models werent bad per say, just needing a good HD update, and this i feel is that HD update :)</div></div><hr />

You mean the minority. Because that's what it actually is. If they completely remade the models then you would see true complaining. Also they said that remaking them isn't what they want. So I see no point to argue about it. If you didn't like the previous model I don't see why you should like the new ones.</div></div><hr />

I fail to understand this mentality. Just because the fora constitute a minority of all players, it does not therefore follow that the concern is one of a minority of players. And besides, if people don't voice their opinion, how is Blizzard to know whether they like a particular feature, anyway? They know that x% of people like blood elves, but they can't infer from that that they like all their features, which is why they solicit feedback to begin with. They definitely take forum feedback into account, like they did with the sameface issue. If you're saying that this is a concern of only a minority of forum-goers, on the other hand, by all means put it up to a poll, but I can pretty confidently assure you that a majority of people will agree that the posture is still not where they want it to be.</div></div><hr />

When I look at human female the word &quot;styrofoam&quot; pops through my mind, as I'm convinced there is no other way she'd be able to swing such things. Female blood elves are really delicate in size, so their weapons should be too.<br />
<br />
But it's a common request so (unfortunately for me) they might actually modify this a bit. Will steer up quite a discussion on the forums, I'm sure.<br />
