Cataclysm Class Preview: Death Knight (Death Knight Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/))<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm will bring with it several changes to class talents and abilities. In this preview, you'll get a glimpse at some of the new abilities, spells, and talents in store for the death knight class, along with an early look at some improvements we plan to make to the rune resource system.<br />
<br />
New Death Knight Abilities<br />
<br />
Outbreak (level 81): Outbreak infects the target with both Frost Fever and Blood Plague at no rune cost. This ability allows death knights to apply diseases quickly when they are switching targets or when their diseases have been dispelled.<br />
<br />
Necrotic Strike (level 83): Necrotic Strike is a new attack that deals weapon damage and applies a debuff that absorbs an amount of healing based on the damage done. For context, imagine that the death knight can choose between doing 8,000 damage outright with a certain ability, or dealing 6,000 damage and absorbing 4,000 points in incoming heals with Necrotic Strike -- the burst is smaller, but a larger overall amount of healing would be required to bring the target back to full health.<br />
<br />
This ability is meant to bring back some of the old flavor from when death knights could dispel heal-over-time (HoT) effects. It also gives the class a bit more PvP utility without simply replicating a Mortal Strike-style effect.<br />
<br />
Dark Simulacrum (level 85): The death knight strikes a target, applying a debuff that allows the death knight to copy the opponent's next spell cast and unleash it. Unlike Spell Reflection, Dark Simulacrum does not cancel the incoming spell. In general, if you can't reflect an ability, you won't be able to copy it either.<br />
<br />
Rune System Changes<br />
<br />
While we're satisfied with the way the rune system works overall, we're making a few major changes to the mechanics that will ultimately help death knight players feel less constrained. Here's the rationale behind the changes, followed by an explanation of how the new system will work.<br />
<br />
In the current rune system, any time a rune is sitting idle, death knights are losing out on potential damage output. By comparison, rogues spend most of their time at low energy levels, and if they're unable to use their skills for a few seconds, that energy builds up and can be spent later, minimizing the net loss from the interruption.<br />
<br />
A death knight's runes, on the other hand, cannot be used until they are fully active. If a death knight ever goes more than a few seconds without spending an available rune, that resource is essentially wasted. Because the death knight is pushing buttons constantly, it can be difficult to add new mechanics to the class because the player doesn't have any free global cooldowns to use them. We can't grant extra resources or reduced cost, because there is no time to spend them. Missing an attack is devastating, and it's impossible to save resources for when they're most useful.<br />
<br />
Additionally, each individual death knight ability has a fairly low impact on its own, making it feel like most of the death knight's attacks are weak. The death knight's rotations are also more easily affected by latency or a player's timing being just a little off. At times, it feels like death knights aren't able to take advantage of their unique resource mechanic, which can diminish the fun.<br />
<br />
The new rune system will change how runes regenerate, from filling simultaneously to filling sequentially. For example, if you use two Blood runes, then the first rune will fill up before the second one starts to fill up. Essentially, you have three sets of runes filling every 10 seconds instead of six individual runes filling every 10 seconds. (Haste will cause runes to fill faster.) Another way to think of this is having three runes that go up to 200% each (allowing extra &quot;storage&quot;), rather than six runes that go up to 100% each.<br />
<br />
As this is a major change to the death knight's mechanics, it will of course require us to retune many of the class's current abilities. For example, each ability needs to hit harder or otherwise be more meaningful since the death knight is getting fewer resources per unit of time. Some abilities will need to have their costs reduced as a result.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Next we'll outline some of the death knight talent-tree changes we're planning in Cataclysm. This list is by no means comprehensive, but it should give you a sense of how we're intending each death knight spec to perform.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest changes we're making is converting Blood into a dedicated tanking tree. While we feel that having three tanking trees was successful overall, it's less necessary in a world with dual-specialization. In addition, the current breakdown isn't as compatible with the Mastery-based passive talent-tree bonuses we want to add (see below). We'd rather spend time tweaking and balancing one good tanking tree rather than having a tank always wondering if they picked the &quot;correct&quot; tree out of three possibilities.<br />
<br />
Blood seemed like the best fit for tanking. Unholy has always had a strong niche with diseases, magic, and command over pets. Frost now feels like a solid dual-wield tree with Frost magic damage and decent crowd control. Blood's niche was self-healing -- fitting for a tank -- as well as strong weapon swings, which could easily be migrated to Frost and Unholy.<br />
<br />
Our plan is to move the most interesting and fun tanking talents and abilities to Blood. For example, you will likely see Vampiric Blood and Will of the Necropolis remain, while Bone Shield will move over from Unholy. <br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Blood<br />
Damage reduction<br />
Vengeance<br />
Healing Absorption<br />
<br />
Healing Absorption: When you heal yourself, you'll receive an additional effect that absorbs incoming damage.<br />
<br />
Vengeance: This new mechanic is designed to ensure that tank damage output (and therefore threat) doesn't fall behind as damage-dealing classes improve their gear during the course of the expansion. All tanking specs will have Vengeance as their second talent tree passive bonus. Whenever a tank gets hit, Vengeance will grant a stacking Attack Power buff equal to 5% of the damage done, up to a maximum of 10% of the character's unbuffed health. For boss encounters, we expect that tanks will always have an Attack Power bonus equal to 10% of their health. The 5% and 10% bonuses assume 51 talent points have been put into the Blood tree; these values will be smaller at lower levels.<br />
<br />
You only get the Vengeance bonus if you have spent the most talent points in the Blood tree, so you won't see Frost or Unholy death knights running around with it. Vengeance will let us continue to design tank gear more or less the way we do today; there will be some damage-dealing stats, but mostly survival-oriented stats. Druids typically have more damage-dealing stats even on their tanking gear, so their Vengeance benefit may be smaller, but the goal is that all four tanks will do about the same damage when tanking.<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
Melee damage<br />
Melee Haste<br />
Runic Power Generation<br />
<br />
Runic Power Generation: This will function as the name implies, and the new rune system will make generating Runic Power more appealing.<br />
<br />
Unholy<br />
Melee damage<br />
Melee and spell critical damage<br />
Disease Damage<br />
<br />
Disease Damage: Unholy death knights will be able to get more out of their diseases, which are integral to the tree's play style.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this preview, and we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on these additions and changes. Please keep in mind that this information represents a work in progress and is subject to change as development on Cataclysm continues.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Here are a few points of clarification:<br />
<br />
We want to provide a 2-handed style for Frost since we recognize that pets are an acquired taste. We think we have the design space to do that now that we don’t need to support Frost tanking. We’re definitely committed to making Frost work as a dual-wield tree though -- that isn’t going away.<br />
<br />
Outbreak is free with a 1-minute cooldown. It’s not supposed to completely replace Plague Strike and Icy Touch.<br />
<br />
We’re not sure how we’re going to handle presences yet. We recognize the oddness of Blood death knights playing in Frost Presence and Frost death knights not playing in Frost Presences. We might rename the presences or take some other action.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mekkatorque Ramps Up Rhetoric<br />
In a surprising and bold manner, High Tinker Mekkatorque declared today that Operation: Gnomeregan is imminent, going so far as to explain his strategy for victory in a three-pronged offensive against Mekgineer Thermaplugg and his irradiated forces. Exiled Gnomeregan citizens will settle for nothing less than the reclamation of their great city.<br />
<br />
We now bring you breaking reports of the impending assaults on Gnomeregan from the field.<br />

<br />
As far as I understand it, the runes will regenerate one at a time rather than simultaneously. This means that you have to wait twice as long after using a two-rune ability before the runes will both be ready again. However, they will make rune abilities hit harder to compensate for the reduced frequency of attacks which will result from this.</div></div><hr />

They probably won't. I'm guessing that on the whole, tanking as blood may be similar to DPS as blood - kinda how Frost DPS and Frost Tank is currently almost the same rotation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So how are they going to migrate a blood DPS play style to either frost or unholy?<br />

They are making 1Handed strength dps weps, so Frost will be good and ready :)</div></div><hr />

i mean really OH-MY-GOD.<br />
<br />
Throughout this expansion ALL i was asking for is changes to rune system and major changes to the pvp playstyle.<br />
PvE was and will remain completely fine with those changes, we will also probably see some interesting numbers and gearing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, here's a big red Bolded I LOVE YOU for this one!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizzlecrank</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing that our tanking cool downs will cost less runes. They have been saying that 3 runes for DnD is too much. Maybe even change all cds to ruinic power. I can't tell you how annoying it is to pick up something extra in the middle of tanking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barreveler</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They probably won't.

<br />
<br />
They kind of implied that the &quot;large strikes&quot; of blood could easily be migrated. <br />
<br />
But if they don't create a physical DPS centric 2h spec, I just won't be playing my DK much anymore. Honestly I'm not all that impressed by these changes. I neither want to do DW DPS nor worry about a pet when I'm not playing my tank.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radux</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">New abilities sound pretty awesome. I was hoping for a tiny bit more information, but I suppose I can't complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
in other words they're going to have to do a lot more burst.....i thought blizzard was straying away from this for the sake of pvp.<br />
<br />
tho the new system sounds interesting im thinking they are going to have to make a lot of tweaks and i fear that DK's will have to endure what they did throughout a lot of wotlk and that is going through many many changes (tho hopefully everything will be fine tuned by the time cata comes out).<br />
<br />
out break just seems like a way to be able to apply diseases when switching targets if your blood rune it on cd<br />
necrotic strike seems like and ms that has a different mechanic (hopefully it will scale like MS)<br />
and well im not so sure on if this dark simulacrum will make it to the release</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure it was brought up in the Warrior post actually said they are making Heroic Strike/Maul/Rune Strike cost like 10 Rage/Runic - 30 Rage/Runic doing more damage based on the amount of Rage/Runic Power used. If they didn't mention Rune Strike specifically it will probably be the same seeing as Heroic Strike and Maul fill the same role as Rune Strike meaning on next strike moves that are spammed the hell out of.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Yea they don't mention rune strike in the warrior post but they mention pretty much every other on next swing move so I'm guessing it will probably follow them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chin Music</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I reckon these changes, particularly the rune ones are all going to be pretty reliant on what the DK talent trees and abilities end up like in cataclysm.<br />
<br />
From the sounds of things, it seems like abilities that cost runes are going to be more of a big deal since you won't be able to use them as often. As a DK tank sometimes it feels like I don't have enough buttons to press to maintain threat when all my runes are on cooldown, but then I remember this is probably where Rune Strike will come in. No &quot;on next swing&quot; for Rune Strike means it's gonna be the go-to ability for tanks when your rune abilities are on cooldown.<br />
<br />
But overall it sounds like how you use your runes is going to be much more important. Blizz said that missing an attack as a DK was devastating. Now it's going to be using the wrong attack.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomspirit</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I understand it, the runes will regenerate one at a time rather than simultaneously. This means that you have to wait twice as long after using a two-rune ability before the runes will both be ready again. However, they will make rune abilities hit harder to compensate for the reduced frequency of attacks which will result from this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not at all.<br />
<br />
Runes will work like this.<br />
<br />
Consider each type of rune to be an &quot;energy bar&quot;:<br />
-blood bar<br />
-frost bar<br />
-unholy bar<br />
Each bar has 2 charges that fills up over time.<br />
Keeping the same time (10s for 2 runes) means that it will take 5s to get 1 charge.<br />
This will allow DK's to go on the move like rogues without losing dps, because when you pass the charge 1, you are not wasting any rune regen like now.</div></div><hr />

Here are a few points of clarification:<br />
<br />
* We want to provide a 2-handed style for Frost since we recognize that pets are an acquired taste. We think we have the design space to do that now that we don’t need to support Frost tanking. We’re definitely committed to making Frost work as a dual-wield tree though -- that isn’t going away.<br />
* Outbreak is free with a 1-minute cooldown. It’s not supposed to completely replace Plague Strike and Icy Touch.<br />
* We’re not sure how we’re going to handle presences yet. We recognize the oddness of Blood death knights playing in Frost Presence and Frost death knights not playing in Frost Presences. We might rename the presences or take some other action.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very nice dk changes all around! I might have to get lvling mine again finally!<br />

Also the ekstra comments are interesting for those that was concerned about a 2hander spec without pets.</div></div><hr />

Necroitic strike is better than MS (Now 20%), because it'l prevent the enemy healer from saving his buddy when you need to prevent that, whereas some healing is still done with MS.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Thermaplugg is no trifling gnome, though his arrogance will be his undoing! Even still, he is undoubtedly preparing never-before-seen forces to meet this assault. Only the most battle-hardened heroes of the Alliance (levels 75-80) will be called to serve during Operation: Gnomeregan. When Mekkatorque determines the operation is ready to get underway, you must speak with him on the front lines before following him on a full assault of the enemy air field, surface command post, and into the tunnels of lower Gnomeregan. It is said that Thermaplugg has employed the use of so-called &quot;Brag&quot;-bots to spread his propaganda and hubris. Be not afraid of his words, fellow members of the Alliance. Stick with Mekkatorque and Doc Cogspin to ensure your safety. After all, you wouldn't want to lose the grace of Cogspin's Surgeon General's Warding. Gnomeregan must be cleansed of irradiation and the troggs it was intended to repel. It is time to reclaim this modern marvel and earn your very own Gnomeregan Overcloak, a testament to your historic bravery in the face of madness!<br />

think of it this way, if you attack a warrior with spell reflect and the spell hits you instead, it will do the same against the DK, except the DK will take the effect as well as you. healing yourself wont heal the DK.</div></div><hr />

Now I just have to decide whether I want to go Frost or Unholy as my DPS spec. Frost actually sounds really cool with its faster runic power regeneration (which will make a big difference with the way things are headed), bonus haste and smashing faces with two weapons. But Unholy has always been attractive to me, and with the boost to diseases, it may be even moreso.<br />

I think the new rune system sounds a bit lame too, because I suspect it is going to play like 3 separate rage bars. I really worry that WOW is just going to far into the homeginaztion of all classes and Cataclysm might turn out to be a bit fo a disaster in beta</div></div><hr />

complete different class than 2H Blood. <br />
<br />
Their rotations are basically the same. Just replace some arbitrary strikes with ones of a different name. Then summon gargoyle/drw every few<br />
minutes. The main difference is one has a ghoul out 100% sitting on autoattack and the other waits awhile to summon it. <br />
<br />
Blood DPS isn't worlds different. Get over it.</div></div><hr />

i always had more utility as a DK than the other dps classes, and the current pve dps rotations are more interesting than other's classes<br />
a new &quot;awesome pve strike&quot; will only make our roations even more complex than it already is<br />
<br />
the rune change is cool and good to know i wont be more GCD locked and haste wont be a bad stat for me anymore<br />
<br />
blood always been the most boring DK dps spec, and its only differential was its lack of personality compared to other specs<br />
frost got the hard hitting strikes, frost magic, aoe, heavy RP use and now dual wield<br />
unholy got deceases, some aoe, magic damage, anti magic and a pet(the lowest maintance pet in game, i wish my marksman hutner pet was that pratical)<br />
<br />
and blood got? it self heals better than the other specs, oh yeah it had dancing rune weapon till they nerfed it to the point of being barely usefull and a watered down rotation... awesome<br />
<br />
<br />
i would rather have blood becoming a good dps spec, but a single tank tree is good for the class as whole, so good its blood who is taking the bullet</div></div><hr />

It was fairly simple and allowed for decent DPS even if the rotation wasn't perfect. Unholy always seemed cheap to me, probably because of every Ghoul in PvP Gnawed my Shaman at every opportunity, and Frost, while interesting, just didn't resonate with me as well.<br />
<br />
And they even admit that having Blood tanks in Frost presence and Frost DPS in Blood presence is awkward. Why don't they just make Frost the tank spec, and keep Blood how it is? Another change for the sake of change by Blizzard, methinks.</div></div><hr />

just think about the sind fight...<br />
you cast Dark Simulacrum and reflect a ice breath back on the boss every time it is off CD.<br />
I personally think this ability is going to REALLY individualize every boss due to the fact you have to now be on watch for their abilitys. I do have a feeling that this will be the Blood lvl 85 talent tho.<br />

There are 6 different types of PvE players playing DK's alone, probably 2 or 3 more in PvP. In terms of balancing, all these changes are what the DK class needed. Blizzard doesn't have to worry now about balancing so many different playstyles to keep DK's competitive. Trust me fellow DK's, these changes are all for the best :)</div></div><hr />

It's too early to tell if you'll be able to copy a boss ability, which shouldn't be reflectable (as what we're used to), but with the changes to how damage is dished out by bosses, and healing to players, there might be plenty of abilities to copy from the big baddies. Otherwise it falls flat on its face as yet another mediocre &quot;final level&quot; ability (&quot;Army of the Dead&quot; was quite the lackluster as well).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also slightly confused about what will happen to Rune Strike because right now one of the things that makes blood the best tanking specs is because of all the + physical damage it gains which therefore means the largest Rune Strikes of any spec. And now they say they want us using more RP? For what? So my blood tank can spam death coil? You must be kidding: the threat generation and damage that a blood tank gets from death coil is laughable.<br />
<br />
Basically I'm confused as to what bloods RP dump will be. Frost has FS, UH gains much more benifit from death coil so I'm hoping they come up with something nice, shiny and new for the blood tanks to dump all their RP on.</div></div><hr />

Compare this with Warriors and you may just understand why the warrior thread has blossomed into a massive storm of anger and fear about how terrible warriors might become (or, for the non-warriors, how &quot;COOL&quot; Heroic Leep is).<br />

They didn't mention how strange it is for Unholy DKs to be in Blood Presence, either.<br />
<br />
The way I imagine it, Blood Presence should increase your healing received and your overall defensive ability; Frost Presence should increase your Haste and your RP/rune regeneration; and Unholy Presence should increase your Crit and disease damage dealt. Something like that, anyway. Then it becomes clear cut just which presences you should be in.<br />

I think what they originally wanted was for situational benefits for each, so that you wouldn't always be stuck in one presence. If you think about it, if you're always one one particular presence all the time then it's almost pointless to have a presence at all... there's no &quot;presence dancing&quot; like a warrior, except possibly switching to emergency off-tank something.</div></div><hr />

The Necrotic Strike sounds quite nice as a flavour ability for the class and more than useful in PvP - provided the DK player is any good and knows when to best use it, so no complaints there from the healer within me - and the level 85 spell does seem a bit situational and weak, but Army of the Dead is a bit so-so as well. I guess we'll be seeing a lot more PvE fights where clever use of your class tools and spells will be called into use a lot more with any luck. It does make sense to have it still deal damage to the Death Knight; after all, they're essentially spell reflecting, but without the drawback of having to equip a shield first. Perhaps it might even provide a 'turn the tables' option for the DK depending on how they manage their cooldowns and RP. You're fight a Warlock or Mage and you're about evenly matched, however they get a few lucky shots on you and you're forced to use AMS just as they get a bit cocky and keep casting / pop a cooldown - you could aborb the damage from their spells as extra runic power, follow it up with Suma and then finish them off with Strangulate and some Strikes. <br />
<br />
The problem there of course is that it does sound very PvP based, but if the spells and talent changes are anything to hint towards, maybe they're providing an early clue as to what Cataclysm PvE will be like too. Don't be too hasty to jump the gun.<br />
<br />
I play as Unholy normally and quite enjoy it, and have a DW Frost spec too with Icy Talons.. I tried to turn it into a tank spec but I can't say I've tried it much. but have enjoyed dpsing and pvping with the spec somewhat, but was looking forward to becoming a fairly useful Frost tank since Blood didn't seem all that appealing compared to Unholy. In any case I look forward to seeing the talent trees anyway, maybe I'll be swayed when I see it, since having two dps specs seems counter productive when I actually quite enjoy tanking. :)<br />

&quot;We want to provide a 2-handed style for Frost since we recognize that pets are an acquired taste. We think we have the design space to do that now that we don’t need to support Frost tanking.

<br />
They've said several times that Rune Strike is going away with the rest of the &quot;on next swing&quot; attacks even before this update.<br />
<br />
Solid updates for the class as a whole. Given the track record of the DK, I was expecting something woefully overpowered to show up in the preview, but everything seems to be fairly well in order.<br />
<br />
I will say that I share the community's concerns over rune consumption and tanking. The D&amp;D rune usage and subsequent cooldown have been a constant thorn in my side with DK tanking since day one. It's not something you tend to notice a lot in raids, but tanking a heroic is noticeably more painful with a DK than with the other three tanks, and it sounds like the new rune system will make it exponentially more difficult.<br />
<br />
Tanks want to be fast, consistent, and versatile. Not slow, bursty, and constrained.</div></div><hr />

They fixed that a while ago. You used to be able to reflect the knockback portion, but not the damage. Ele shaman could use it like it was a disengage that did damage. Jump in the air, thunderstorm, they do damage to the warrior and launch themselves away from the warrior.</div></div><hr />

New rune system sounds slow and boring. I like having to time everything perfectly thats why i play frost at the moment. <br />
<br />
I know all the PvP'ers out there will love this post, the tanks have had there bit of info as well, what about us DPS DK's because from where I'm sitting Druid changes are going to have to really really suck today or my DK wont be being leveled =(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrOrmen</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm i love the talent changes to blood, awesome as i'm tanking blood atm. though i will have to say i'm worried about rune strike, because main part of a blood dks treath comes from that very same ability, okay a dk can pull off 12k tps with a good rotation of icy touch and rune strike, but tbh i didn't think the icy touch buf was needed anyways. because as dk you have 2 taunts wich means that you can just taunt that gives you 3 secs to gain treath and tbh that is plenty. but that is just how i feel but imo snap agro has never been a big issue, you just get all the hunters and rogue to use tricks and MD. but tbh i rly don't hope that they won't remove rune strike.<br />
<br />
Outbreak = Ridiculus, i mean what do you think we have pestilence for? and i mean immagine this scenario, a dk rushes in to an arena, blows outbreak gets 2 debuffs on the target and has ALL his runes left, that means 2x scourge strike, and i know all you caster and healers knows what this means, bam bam 2x 8k crits = dead caster. Another thing i think it will be taking away the use of icy touch and plague strike, wich i imo think will not work for the dk class overall.<br />
Any ways my idea is, make this abiliy cost 1 frost and 1 unholy rune, wich evens out the diffrence in runes left, it still gives a noticeable benefit, but you can also still choose the more damage than the more time.<br />
<br />
Necrotic Strike sounds like an awesome ability, if they can get it to work proberly and balance it with attack power in away so that it scales but not so it scales so much that in the end it absorbs 25% of the targets hp, imo it sounds like a good plan to have it absorb arround 15% of that total hp. though i have to say to this ability. this really needs work because combined with strangulate this will be a quick way to kill a target. just saying this could become something that will be a menace towards healers who still atm has a hard time outhealing dk dps. but imo i think this will be a very good variation to our main pvp abilities<br />
<br />
Dark Simulacrum, spell reflect for dks? no need i say, i mean we all rdy have anti magic shell and zone, and do we need the exstra damage imo not. but lest see how this wroks out, but atm i think this will be abit to much against caster.</div></div><hr />

It looks to me like blizz made few astonishing new skills so they try and mask the huge changes that will kill the unique part of DKs.<br />
<br />
Starting off with rune system, its so gonna limit dks capability to imrpovise in both PvP and PvE, because you are limited to 3 runes at time, ok sure you can wait for all to come up, but thats like double the time that is now. I can see it already on start you use all 6 runes, then waith 10s use 3 runes then wait another 10s use next 3 runes etc etc, so limiting that its beyond stupid, not to mention so predictable.<br />
<br />
Next off, making each tree focused on diff aspect of the game, thats like removing the most unique part of DKs, that beeign 3 trees of which every one can be used for any occasion(diff talent trees for same purpose), and making DKs like all other classes where the creativity of the way you wanna set your talents is dead(1 tree tank, 1 tree dw or even worse PvE and one 2h or even worse PvP).<br />
<br />
All in all, the changes are bad, sure the skills they trow at us look cool for PvP, but the real changes to the class mechanics are just a class killer and for what, so they can have yet another non unique class that is easy to balance, well fuck that shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can 2 out of 3 new spells be PvP stuff...?<br />
So from 81 to 85 I won't be visiting the trainer at all.<br />
People were sad because PvE spells are balanced around PvP.<br />
Nice way to solve the problem - just don't bother with PvE spells at all!<br />
Really, that's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I know it's just a brief overview and it's by no means final, but I pretty much believe that the list of new spells is complete for each class - as you could see from other previews, all classes get 3 new spells, at 81, 83 and 85 level. So about PvE I should get all excited about some spell at 81 that doesn't even add anything new, but rather makes a class mechanic less tedious, and that's it. <br />
Classes get friendly death grips, air jumps, cool shiny new spells, DKs get... PvP stuff. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haidaes</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest ? The only thing that comes to mind when reading this post is: underwhelming.<br />
Lets have a look at the three abilities that we might acquire on our way to level 85 (if they make it to life):<br />
<br />
Outbreak: As far as i can see its only single target. It has 1 minute cooldown and does take up a GCD, furthermore we don't know if it will do any dmg at all for the moment. That leaves us with 1 GCD saved, while potentially doing no dmg at all at the beginning of 1 disease cycle. The one GCD we gain by this is easily nullified by the fact that we won't be GCD capped anymore, which means 1 GCD might be worth nothing in comparison. So its quite a useless tool for PvE.<br />
<br />
Necrotic Strike: Besindes the fun-fact, that some people already saw it coming thanks to the lack of blizzards imagination, we get a 100% PvP tool, because any healing done during a PvE encounter is way out of league to the possible heal it could prevent w/o beeing severly overpowered in PvP. Therefore if I wanted to bring something to a boss fight that prevents healing I'd still be bound to bring a MS-debuff.<br />
<br />
Dark Simulacrum: Sounds nice at first, but will have as much impact on us as does Spellreflect do now on a protection warrior: none at all. Theres a high possibility that it won't be usable as a non-tank at all during a fight and even if it is usable by every DK no matter the role, it still won't be able to copy any of the sweet spells, because they can't be reflected for a reason now and i hightly doubt they will change this. So another PvP skill and a way more clunky version than the original skill.<br />
<br />
As for the whole post, am i the only one that thinks they somehow left out huge chunks of information compared to the other classes already released ? The talent changes section was kind of smal compared to the other classes, which leaves me still so room for hope that they just pushed out our information too early while they should have waited with it like they did with paladins.<br />
<br />
Still I do have some concerns about our future. First of all I somehow get the feeling that we will be kind of pigeonholed (haven't used that word since Wotlk Beta) into DW like all the other clalsses that melee DPS out there. As soon as they started buffing frost dw (now that they finally know where they want it to go) they just managed to let it overshadow all the other speccs on the life servers. 1 Unholy is only still viable because of the buff it brings for the raid. The chances of 2h frost beeing equal within a 1% range does not seem to be very likly and we will have to see how unholy will hold its ground as soon as the DK becomes one of those unsteady dps speccs out there thanks to the new rune system. Which leads me to my second concern, I for one, loved beeing occupied all the time as a death knight! It was acutally what lead to the DK in the first place. <br />
<br />
For now I'm not really eager to play the expansion, as nothing they showed today really stikes me as something I wanted for my class. Though I will not start bitching around about quitting and stuff, I still don't really appreaciate the design choices and the direction all of this is headed. <br />
And here I hoped all DK's would get AoE Deathgrip :(<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
About the ongoing blood tank discussion: Blood might be &quot;the tank specc&quot; atm because of the extra life you gain by speccing into it, but this does still not make it the best specc ever. If blizzard would finally manage to make avoidance and mitigation worth it and would stop encouraging every tank to aim for &quot;the one stat&quot; (stamina) things might look alot diffrent. For 5 man and non-bosstank duties frost always proved to be alot more reliable. Besides the fact that offtank duty in most fights is the real work (standing in one place while wearing the best gear aka beeing maintank does require nothing of the player at all..) I can't help myself but laugh at all those wannabe bleeding edge maintanks that join your heroic group in their cute t9 and try to tank with their awsome blood specc they just coppied off some random idiot who coppied it off another who himself coppied it off some guy who does tank LK25heroic.<br />
Don't get me wrong, blood is the best spec atm when it comes to beeing the MT, but the excuses they use atm are kind of lame. They invested nothing into the blood tree at all since the beginning of ulduar, no wonder it lacks alot compared to frost that was changed every patch quite a bit since then. <br />
<br />
P.P.S. Sorry for the bad grammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because the spells wont be added to your rotation, wont mean that you can't use them... sigh..<br />
<br />
<br />
You do know that bosses have millions upon millions of health points? You also know that when a mob heals, it won't be healing for &lt;10k HP because that's not much more than one-spells worth of damage to a PvE mob? Typically when these bosses heal, they are healing for 100s of 1,000s of health, right? Is that 10,000 or so absorb really going to compare to 20% reduction over X amount of time? No, it will barely scratch to heal.<br />
<br />
And blizz even said in the post for Dark Simulacrum that: &quot;In general, if you can't reflect an ability, you won't be able to copy it either.&quot; Now go ask warriors how many spells they can reflect in raids and you can get your answer. This may of course change in cataclysm, but bosses rarely throw mediocre spells at people, and it still has no mitigation property, making it a weak spell reflect.<br />
<br />
They are both, obviously meant for PvP. In all honesty though, the PvP orientation isn't what bugs me about this preview; what bugs me is that it feels like they're simply recapping things we already know through 50% of the whole post, giving very few details beyond &quot;bone shield will be in blood.&quot;, &quot;runes will recharge sequentially.&quot; and the blood/unholy mastery bonuses.<br />
<br />
We already knew that they wanted to change runes to make them less GCD restricted, we also knew from the large post a few days ago that blood was going to be the new tank tree; so why in gods name did they think devoting the entire talents preview to talking about it while giving almost no examples baffles me. What's going to happen to DRW? What about blood AoE? Will its blood boil finally do more threat that unholys blood boil, or will it get some sort of spell damage buff so their diseases, DnD, or any AoE actually gains benefits from blood? I feel like a warrior getting all the physical damage boosting talents, but then I'm handed a bunch of spells for AoE abilities and must expect them to have enough punch to do their job, even though all my blood talents increase physical damage scaling.<br />
<br />
If blood doesn't have some better utility beyond single target (which part of the reason it was great for MT was the physical damage boost to rune strike), I feel I might just bash my head through the wall because I really can't take blood for anything other then MTing. There is a reason my off-spec is an AoE/utility frost tank... and that's because I don't want to commit suicide in frustration.<br />
<br />
I for sure rank it as overall underwhelming, though I still look forward to Dark Simulacrum just for the lawlz.</div></div><hr />

It's not &quot;blatantly&quot; taken at all, it's just YOUR little favorite corner of the pop culture universe and of course it just HAS to be a copy because you're ignorant and have no other point of reference to compare. Just like those posters saying X ability was UNDENIABLY stolen from their obscure pet favorite game that barely anyone's heard of, as if it was so damned unique in the first place.</div></div><hr />

but one thing i realy dont get/like is the rune system...<br />
does it mean that we dont get all runes on CD / means 4/4 t10 set useless?<br />
and death-runes dont come back from GCD together? juest piece after piece...?<br />
seams not very nice.. but hope im wrong and it will be just soo HOTTT <br />

<br />
Outbreak is obviously made for PvE too<br />
<br />
Necrotic Strike will also work on PvE bosses that heals... think Freya or Anub'arak, since it wont stack with ms effects.<br />
<br />
Dark Simulacrum will work on everything that casts spells. You don't even have to be MT to copy it. That means that you can copy hard-hitting boss spells.<br />
<br />
Just because the spells wont be added to your rotation, wont mean that you can't use them... sigh..<br />
<br />
Outbreak is... Game-breaking?<br />
<br />
Yeah. There are so many bosses that heal, you know! 1 boss per tier, that's huge, dude! Not to mention that if there are castable heals, they'll most likely be interruptable. or else &quot;reducing&quot; a 200k heal to a 195k heal is just so damn awesome! This is PvP ability, what's so hard to figure about it?<br />
<br />
Yes, you can definitely copy hard-hitting boss spells. Let's reflect that friggin' Soul Reaper back to the friggin' Arthas! Or Sindragosa's Frost Breath back to her, take that 50k hit back, byatch!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fonill</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest ? The only thing that comes to mind when reading this post is: underwhelming.<br />
Lets have a look at the three abilities that we might acquire on our way to level 85 (if they make it to life):<br />
<br />
Outbreak: As far as i can see its only single target. It has 1 minute cooldown and does take up a GCD, furthermore we don't know if it will do any dmg at all for the moment. That leaves us with 1 GCD saved, while potentially doing no dmg at all at the beginning of 1 disease cycle. The one GCD we gain by this is easily nullified by the fact that we won't be GCD capped anymore, which means 1 GCD might be worth nothing in comparison. So its quite a useless tool for PvE.<br />
<br />
Necrotic Strike: Besindes the fun-fact, that some people already saw it coming thanks to the lack of blizzards imagination, we get a 100% PvP tool, because any healing done during a PvE encounter is way out of league to the possible heal it could prevent w/o beeing severly overpowered in PvP. Therefore if I wanted to bring something to a boss fight that prevents healing I'd still be bound to bring a MS-debuff.<br />
<br />
Dark Simulacrum: Sounds nice at first, but will have as much impact on us as does Spellreflect do now on a protection warrior: none at all. Theres a high possibility that it won't be usable as a non-tank at all during a fight and even if it is usable by every DK no matter the role, it still won't be able to copy any of the sweet spells, because they can't be reflected for a reason now and i hightly doubt they will change this. So another PvP skill and a way more clunky version than the original skill.<br />
<br />
As for the whole post, am i the only one that thinks they somehow left out huge chunks of information compared to the other classes already released ? The talent changes section was kind of smal compared to the other classes, which leaves me still so room for hope that they just pushed out our information too early while they should have waited with it like they did with paladins.<br />
<br />
Still I do have some concerns about our future. First of all I somehow get the feeling that we will be kind of pigeonholed (haven't used that word since Wotlk Beta) into DW like all the other clalsses that melee DPS out there. As soon as they started buffing frost dw (now that they finally know where they want it to go) they just managed to let it overshadow all the other speccs on the life servers. 1 Unholy is only still viable because of the buff it brings for the raid. The chances of 2h frost beeing equal within a 1% range does not seem to be very likly and we will have to see how unholy will hold its ground as soon as the DK becomes one of those unsteady dps speccs out there thanks to the new rune system. Which leads me to my second concern, I for one, loved beeing occupied all the time as a death knight! It was acutally what lead to the DK in the first place. <br />
<br />
For now I'm not really eager to play the expansion, as nothing they showed today really stikes me as something I wanted for my class. Though I will not start bitching around about quitting and stuff, I still don't really appreaciate the design choices and the direction all of this is headed. <br />
And here I hoped all DK's would get AoE Deathgrip :(<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
About the ongoing blood tank discussion: Blood might be &quot;the tank specc&quot; atm because of the extra life you gain by speccing into it, but this does still not make it the best specc ever. If blizzard would finally manage to make avoidance and mitigation worth it and would stop encouraging every tank to aim for &quot;the one stat&quot; (stamina) things might look alot diffrent. For 5 man and non-bosstank duties frost always proved to be alot more reliable. Besides the fact that offtank duty in most fights is the real work (standing in one place while wearing the best gear aka beeing maintank does require nothing of the player at all..) I can't help myself but laugh at all those wannabe bleeding edge maintanks that join your heroic group in their cute t9 and try to tank with their awsome blood specc they just coppied off some random idiot who coppied it off another who himself coppied it off some guy who does tank LK25heroic.<br />
Don't get me wrong, blood is the best spec atm when it comes to beeing the MT, but the excuses they use atm are kind of lame. They invested nothing into the blood tree at all since the beginning of ulduar, no wonder it lacks alot compared to frost that was changed every patch quite a bit since then. <br />
<br />
P.P.S. Sorry for the bad grammer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amen Brother, I have spent the better part of 3.3 proving that not only is blood viable but in the right hands not only competitive with the top dps specs but also a reliable dps spec. I can only imagine that the new rune changes will turn all specs into the clunky feeling that unholy has atm. (IMO zero fun.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puntar</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a fan of turning Blood into the tanking spec, since I had a lot of fun DPSing as Blood. It was fairly simple and allowed for decent DPS even if the rotation wasn't perfect. Unholy always seemed cheap to me, probably because of every Ghoul in PvP Gnawed my Shaman at every opportunity, and Frost, while interesting, just didn't resonate with me as well.<br />
<br />
And they even admit that having Blood tanks in Frost presence and Frost DPS in Blood presence is awkward. Why don't they just make Frost the tank spec, and keep Blood how it is? Another change for the sake of change by Blizzard, methinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
'cause Frost has Dual Wield talent which increases damage.<br />
<br />
New rune system is rather bull. Instead of increasing rune CD to 12 sec and made them affected by haste, they rather make this silly change.<br />
<br />
Under new system, unless you use (empowered weapon) YOU WILL NEVER have 2 of the same rune available in the middle of combat!<br />
<br />
Unless of course you wait for entire duration of next 1 (blood, frost, unholy) rune and only use abilities which are not tied with corresponding rune</div></div><hr />

I confess I have not spent much time on my DK beyond getting him to 80 and doing some LFG tanking. Mainly because the class feels spammy and urgent in its playstyle, even while tanking. Personally, I'd want big strikes like Obliterate and Scourge Strike to generate big numbers, this will happen now for sure. I do wonder how this will be balanced though between PvE and PvP. Rune abilities will likely do more damage than non-rune ones so DK dps will be cyclical. This means that their burst will be quite higher than their sustained dps. <br />
It also creates a new priority game; unless you are in very short combat or near the end of combat, rune abilities will likely be ranked in the priority system by their ability to sustain dps during the no-rune phase; this may likely mean that runes will be expended in two separate sets instead of in a short burst so that runic power generation is more even. So you will be expending one set of BFU runes, using non-rune abilities while they recharge, and then use those same runes again leaving the second set available for emergency utilities or for burst. If you use all your runes upfront you may end up capping runic power early and wasting some, so that on the non-rune part of the cycle you may end up having no resources to use and losing GCDs. It feels very elegant and intelligent to me and less of a whac-a-mole feel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Rune attacks are deliberately doubled in damage ('cause of rune changes), vengeance mastery will just wreck balance in DK tank favor just too much. <br />
<br />
Unless Blood talent tree will be completely overhauled to use mostly runic based attacks.<br />

Who cares ?<br />
<br />
The whole system is going to change, for all we know all dual rune abilities are changed into single rune abilities and will hit harder. Meaning instead of seeing pathetic 2k bloodstrikes in between 4k white hits, you'll finally see specials being special.<br />
<br />
This is a good change.<br />
<br />
I think the whole idea of pressing a button every single GCD only to see a yellow number half that of your regular white numbers was pretty lame to start with.<br />
I'd rather do less attacks, and the ability to pool runes for on demand burst. Than this rigid system we have now.<br />

I'm quite disappointed with the new abilities though. They're all mostly catered towards pvp and our 85 one is simply a crappy version of spell reflect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With increased damage, PvP will be no different that its now. Even with 3x more hp, damage with specials will still be even higher and people WILL STILL die in 3 - 4 GCD.<br />
<br />
Considering that Blizz oficaily stated that healing WILL NOT increase, DK changes are against the spirit of the healing intentions!<br />
<br />
New system is even more rigid than its now. At least now you have flexibility options. In Cata DKs will have even less choice.</div></div><hr />

You might want to play a warrior then ?<br />
I dare say most people enjoy playing a DK partial because of the way you got something to do instead of standing around, having a white hit every now and then and waiting for your resources to finally be off CD again.<br />
<br />
The whole argument about DK abilities having a weak feeling is kind of strange anyway. My Warlock sure does sometimes see bigger hits, but most of the time they are rarely over lets say 15k crits. My DK does critical hits around 10k -14k on a regular basis instant just limitied by the rune cd and the GCD, so the whole argument feels kinda made up anyway because we are throwing huge numbers around all the time. Futhermore we are a DoT using class, which results in our dmg sources beeing devided into alot of smaler pools, still adding up significantly. If I wanted to see my dmg come from 3 sources I'd reroll arcane mage for the &quot;huge number&quot; feeling.<br />
<br />
Btw, where was stated that double rune abilities will be turned into single rune abilities ? The just said they will adjust the costs which could mean anything from replacing some costs with RP over double unholy runes to said single rune costs. By the looks of it , they should just scrap the whole rune system and make them 3 energy bars with abilities costing diffrent percentages. Then at least we will be proper rogue/warrior clones.<br />

<br />
Above will be what you see when you enter combat, all 6 runes available for that initial ramp up and burst, but when any given rune is on CD after the initial use they will refill 1 at a time soon as one is used, so after ramp up have 3 runes available at any given time to make sure you use up your runic power in between rune CD's.<br />
<br />
[ B ] [ B ] [ F ] [ F ] [ U ] [ U ]<br />

Above, the bold letters would represent whats available once you've used the 6 initial runes to get the runic power pool built up for the in between attacks, The Italic are what are on CD waiting for the bold ones to be used then they would become bold and the others would not be, this will continue to happen back and forth until out of combat.</div></div><hr />

It's likely that DS will have 2 buttons, like warlock teleport. One button will put a debuff on target, and when they cast a spell (one which is reflectable) you obtain a copy of it. That is when you use your second button, which unleashes this spell at a target. This would allow for PVE usage on bosses with spells by a dpser. Whether it will be able to be used on healers ... unlikely, as heals are not reflectable, though only because they are not targeted at enemy players.</div></div><hr />

Many care, because the fun in DK is the dynamics of the rotation and the use of every gcd when you can. Tbh thats exacly what makes the diff between two players, how good can you execute the rotation, while with new system the rotation will be 2-3 hits, empty rp, chill for 4-5s making it so dull that the gap between ppl who can do proper rotation and ppl who fall behind will be gone, which obviously sucks.<br />
<br />
Also, as ppl stated if you are BIG CRITS horny play the class that is made that way, dont play dk, since the all idea behind dks is that their dmg comes from many sources that on separate base are not huge bursts, but when put together they make high dmg output.<br />
<br />
P.S. Wanted to add, i rly hope they dont make DW the only viable PvE build in Cata, since as i see it DKs are made to run around with 2h and be bad asses, not to be plate rogues and have 1h.</div></div><hr />

By definition, abilities that are helpfull or designed to improve your job in pve (more spesific &quot;boss fights&quot;) are &quot;non cool&quot; abilities, because the requirement for them to be usefull in pve is either : heal MORE, dmg MORe or withstand MORE dmg. If you think about it, in order for a spell to be cool it can't be very usefull for pve : /<br />
<br />
I heal more, ye that's a fun spell. I dmg more, yaay. I tank more wooo.<br />
<br />
Healing raind and gushing wounds are maybe exeptions, but that's because they bare bringing something that also works in pvp pretty good. You can't however give classes that are ding good in dps allready, a new dmg'ing tool and call it cool, if it doesn't have a big use in pvp:P There are some exeptions ofc, but in generall that's how I feel :D <br />
<br />
Peace out.</div></div><hr />

The rune changes will be trivial once you have enough haste, it will actually be faster than the current setup. Also if you want speed of attacks, frost will be for you becasue of the extra runic power generation.</div></div><hr />

No. Read the post gain.<br />

<br />
Dark Simulacrum (level 85): The death knight strikes a target, applying a debuff that allows the death knight to copy the opponent's next spell cast and unleash it. Unlike Spell Reflection, Dark Simulacrum does not cancel the incoming spell. In general, if you can't reflect an ability, you won't be able to copy it either.</div></div><hr />

This means that you have to wait twice as long after using a two-rune ability before the runes will both be ready again. However, they will make rune abilities hit harder to compensate for the reduced frequency of attacks which will result from this.<br />

Abilities are going to hit a hell of a lot harder and there will probably be at least 2 runic dump abilities or more in between CD's, so its not going to be that bad. As your haste raises throughout the expansion your runes will be ready faster. Believe me once you get them down to a 5 second refresh you will be laughing.</div></div><hr />

Me too, but frost will definitely fill that role with the runic power mastery. With more runic power generating you will be able to enjoy a similar play style like right now. We will just see a little more auto attacking during our ramp ups is all. DK are getting the burst back that we had before the massive nerfs at the beginning of LK which isnt so bad.</div></div><hr />

Thats the same like saying we will suck in Cataclysm. While 5 seconds might sound nice, who knows if we will ever reach that point ? Who says stacking haste that much will be the way to go in the future? What gives you the confidence, that in the end our playstyle won't shift in way (like it did from wotlk beta to now) that will let you hit like a truck but only once every - lets say - 8-9 seconds because itemization will go a completly diffrent way?<br />
I'm deeply concerned that this class will drift away from its current path in a way alot of people won't like it. I also do not feel like waiting about 2 years for Cataclysm's endgame content to finally have the class back i always loved playing. <br />
<br />
And as for the tanks among us, what makes you think they will have the room to stack haste to have their class be like what it is now (given that they like how the class feels at the moment).<br />
<br />
Please, don't get me wrong. I don't want by any means to sound like someone who's shouting &quot;the Sky is falling&quot;, I just do not share your optimism when Blizzard starts to screw things over that worked fine so far. Though I have to admit this is something Warriors and Feral Druids are facing too, given that their energy supply will be remoddelt alot too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, I think these DK changes are amazing, The new rune system, dedicated dps tree instead of 3 tanking trees. With the DK new MS stacking with real MS, TSG might be back! lol<br />
<br />
Cata will be the pinicle of WoW it seems. Balance and fixes. <br />
<br />
<br />
cataclysm will be the end off wow.<br />
making it so popular the lag will be back 100 times worse then you ever exprienced.<br />
heck lag wont be lag anymore.....<br />
people will all be whining off packet loss aka their abilities fire off but never hit and still taking resources.</div></div><hr />

Not 1, but (2 Jormungars?) a whopping total of THREE specs were killed by the change, so it's a lot more than just Blood-dps people who consider that spec to have been #1. I have always been Frost-only: Frost Tank and Frost DW DPS as offspec and had A TON of fun on both specs, i just loved Frost with all my heart and now they're breaking it up :(<br />
<br />
Blood is very boring tbh, there's nothing interesting about it and pets are just not my thing to even try Unholy, so i would get left out anyway: if Frost would be the single tank, it would have to go away as dps. DW tanking is VERY, VERY fun and I liked it a lot, had no problems in both HC's and raids, but it seems I'll have to say goodbye to good old Howling Blast now, though it's not yet confirmed they're removing it.<br />
<br />
Still, one of the two specs remains and thats DW Frost, so it's not as bad as it could have been. But seriously Blizz...GIEF DW TANKING. 'Tis fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, and they're not exactly a walk in the park for many of us as it is. To be honest the changes they've planned for DKs sounds pretty much like the stuff they have already only in a much stronger and much more useful version. They're basically taking out everything that makes it somewhat &quot;challenging&quot; to play a DK in PvP and giving them things that'll make that trivial, the fact that DKs themselves do not seem to be disappointed in that surprise me.</div></div><hr />

Necrotic Strike and Dark Sim(something, something) look really good as well.<br />
Rune system, im a bit &quot;iffy&quot; about it at the moment but sounds good if blizz pull it off right. <br />
<br />
p.s - I agree with Darthag in an earlier post about Unholy Blight, really loved that spell before they changed it, and if they were gonna change it into a DoT based on damage they could of put it on scale with Hunters Piercing shot at 30% instead of 10%, would of made it more worth while change</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE is inherently repetitive. There are only so many abilities than can be in a rotation, which is what PvE is about. If you're 'good', your GCD is always on cooldown, so where is the room for another 3 PvE abilities? If they add better abilities, others will fade away. They dont want that either.<br />
<br />
PVP is dynamic, and encompasses damage, positioning, reactions, and a whole bunch of abilities which are only PVP related. There are no PvE abilities because theyre all used in PvP too, plus the PvP abilities for PVP.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Outbreak is mostly a pve ability but has some utility in pvp. Necrosis is a MUCH needed pvp ability. Now Druids might actually need a pulse to outheal us. Dark Simulacron looks to be useful for tanks, pve dps, and pvp. It doesn't really look as pvp oriented as people are making it out to be. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malkiah</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my thoughts (for what they're worth):<br />
<br />
1. a single tanking tree is a good thing - an unfortunate loss of the unique nature of the DK talent tree, but ultimately a good move.<br />
<br />
2. to address the AE threat issue that will come up, and to hopefully lessen our dependency on DnD for AE threat, they should change it so that the current threat given by IT threat comes from the application of frost fever, not from IT itself - then just have that threat hit all targets when pestilence is used.<br />
<br />
3. rather than have this vanilla 'vengeance' system they should give DKs a block equivalent that works like this:<br />
DK bonus to parry based on str removed.<br />
new passive ability Riposte added (or added as a talent, perhaps replacing dark conviction) - Riposte allows the DK to turn aside an incoming attack and overcome their enemy with a counter-attack - reducing the damage of the attack by 20% and doing 30% weapon damage as an instant extra attack.<br />
Riposte chance would either scale based on Str to be equivalent to Block, or else rework the Block chance on gear to work for both Block and Riposte.<br />
this would address both the block (and general avoidance) issues DKs have, and also help out with damage without needing to go with some homogenized buff thing.<br />
also, if rune strike is going away, RP won't be as vital to blood - Scent of Blood would be a good ability to make analogous to Redoubt for either Parry or Riposte.<br />
<br />
4. leave bone shield on Unholy, it works well as a survival tool and as a thematic talent - rework dancing rune weapon to be a defensive ability.<br />
give it a Bone Shield like animation, but instead of bones it's whirling blades - these blades could one of two things:<br />
A. provide a large bonus to parry, and a charge is dropped each time an attack is parried (a DK equivalent of Holy Shield)<br />
B. do a small amount of AE damage and moderate AE threat for X amount of time (5 second duration, 30 second CD)</div></div><hr />

As for PVP or DPS concerns, I don't think you boys should fret to hard over it.<br />
I mean if your DPS sucks they can just fix it in some patch a week from then. :)<br />
<br />
But if the tanking sucks you get stuck with a stigma that all DK's are terrible tanks and don't deserve the raid invite. :'(</div></div><hr />
