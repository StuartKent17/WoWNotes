Addon - Reagent Banker<br />
Reagent Banker (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/255228-reagent-banker) is a simple addon that auto deposits reagents to the reagent bank (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Reagent_Bank) when you visit the bank. There are some additional options to modify behavior of the addon and print what is deposited to chat.<br />

Patch 7.1 - Ravika and Lenny &quot;Fingers&quot; McCoy<br />
One small change in Patch 7.1 is the expanded availability of the Patch 5.3 toys. With the launch of Legion, these toys were added to vendors you had to visit before doing the Broken Shore intro (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5896). Now you can also find these vendors out in the world, on Echo Isles (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/113615-ravika#mapper:6453:0) and in Stormwind (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/2795-lenny-fingers-mccoy). <br />
<br />
Bom'bay's Color-Seein' Sauce (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97921-bombays-color-seein-sauce) is also back on the vendor. It was not available on the version of Lenny that appears before the Broken Shore, but is now on both versions. <br />

Fan Art - Updated Paladin Judgment Set<br />
Shem Dawson (https://twitter.com/ShemDawsonArt/with_replies) is a 3D artist at Blizzard and did some personal art (not official) of the Paladin Judgment Set. Scroll down on the page to view it in the 3D modelviewer (https://sketchfab.com/models/f3eb3183601746d2b150737b956d5d07/embed)! You can see the original set here (http://www.wowdb.com/item-sets/217-judgment-armor#model-viewer).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obelisk Kai</div><div class="date">2016-12-30, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every class has that one set that is considered iconic by that class...that is the sum of everything that class is. The Judgement set is that for Paladins, a moment when Blizzard's artists perfected the Paladin look. It still looks great but is just so damn out of date now. Why they keep resisting doing a HD version like the community wants is beyond me but I guess they have their reasons.<br />
<br />
Maybe if they did it for Paladins, everyone would come looking for 'THEIR' definitive HD armor and that would take time?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wonderlust</div><div class="date">2016-12-30, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Samwise Didier designed the Tier 2 armor sets. Judgment for paladins, Bloodfang for rogues, Wrath for warriors, Nemesis for warlocks, etc. Even if some are cooler than others, they're all incredibly iconic. That man knew what he was doing.<br />
<br />
I would love to see all of his work, not just Judgment, re-done in HD and made available in the game.</div></div><hr />

The Judgement set is that for Paladins, a moment when Blizzard's artists perfected the Paladin look. It still looks great but is just so damn out of date now. Why they keep resisting doing a HD version like the community wants is beyond me but I guess they have their reasons.<br />
<br />
Maybe if they did it for Paladins, everyone would come looking for 'THEIR' definitive HD armor and that would take time?<br />
<br />
Well yes, but I honestly wouldn't mind if they did an high-detail update of the &quot;best&quot; of the various tier sets for each class and implemented those as a new tier. Pala one is the judgement set for sure, would love an updated Bloodfang for my rogue.</div></div><hr />

That's why Legion is getting the fastest pacing of any expansion with a huge 7.2 patch and Argus as 7.3 yes? They surely don't care about the game when it's set to receive a hell of a lot more content than it has done in a while yeah? :rolleyes:<br />

... you're so wrong it's not even funny. Legion if anything is the most thought-out expansion to date with all the attention to details and work put into the small things.<br />

WOTLK had Arthas, that's all it had going for it. Compared to Legion, it didn't have a fraction of the content and options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah and then they would lose those people able to run it. The engine is designed so everyone can access the game not people with huge budget PCs. WoW has never been about a realistic approach with it's graphics either. WoW has been accessible to people with low end pcs since 2004 when it could be run on a Pentium 3 and Windows 98/ME. <br />

In short WoW will never go the realistic or high end graphics approach because A- the games artstyle isn't that and B it's aimed at people with older spec machines. Great graphics don't always make a great game.</div></div><hr />

I think this is so contradicting in itself, it is funny and that you don't see it in your cynicism. Unless ofc you are implying Blizzard can put out shitty stuff because people will accept anything no matter how bad and buy it. Well, this forum also contradicts that.<br />

It'd be nice to have better graphics but their philosophy is to make WoW run on the oldest of old PCs (so that they don't lose that demographic). There's a lot more people out there with crappy PCs than there are with nice PCs so it makes sense business wise, just sucks that we'll never see a graphically impressive WoW like that.</div></div><hr />

Paladins are quite literally holy men. i.e. Men of the faith. And that's besides the fact that those are ankhs, not crosses. Jesus. Maybe try to absorb a little culture into your life outside of Japan and Naruto for once.</div></div><hr />

Everything got duller/dingier looking in comparison to old judgements crisp sharp colors. I like both, but I'd prefer if they do something like this with sets that they make both available.</div></div><hr />

But hey, that's just me. This armor looks fantastic.</div></div><hr />
