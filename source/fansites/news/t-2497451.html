PvP Brawl - Classic Ashran<br />
This week's brawl is the epic battleground Ashran in its original form.<br />
Why ashran for the brawl?<br />
assume the “win condition” for the quest is 4 event wins and an enemy general kill?<br />
We’re working on a hotfix that will make the “Something Different” quest complete in the Classic Ashran brawl when you either win any event, or kill Grand Marshal Tremblade / High Warlord Volrath.<br />

Conflict and Strife Rank 2 Acquisition Hotfix<br />
The tool tip for Conflict and Strife says that you need to get conquest cap to get rank one and for rank two you need 1k rating. I hit 1k rating before getting conquest cap so shouldn’t that allow me to skip straight to rank two?<br />
<br />
I pose this question because I only got rank one in my pvp chest and from my perspective it’s an error.<br />
Correct. We had a bug, and we’ve now hotfixed it. We’re working to address the issue for players who already opened it. Thank you!

<br />
While this is true and really should have been permanently changed over a decade ago, when was the last time the head-start actually helped a US guild get world first? I imagine people will be up in arms if it leads to a US guild getting a world first but it isn't like that has happened since Ruby Sanctum, where Blizz tried to open the raid in both the US and EU at the same time anyway.</div></div><hr />

I don't see any reason to? It is hard to describe how teasing and taunting it is to see it advertised as open and waiting here and in the launcher only to login and be denied access.</div></div><hr />

Guess you should move to NA then and stop crying about something that's been a thing since 2004. Imagine crying about that, something that's been a thing since the dawn of the game</div></div><hr />

Just because something has been a thing for a long while doesn't make it immune to any sort of criticism.</div></div><hr />
