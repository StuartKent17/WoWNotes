Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 2 goes live Tuesday, January 23, and with it come a few system changes and updated Conquest rewards.<br />
<br />
Conquest Reward Updates<br />
With PvP Season 2, we’ve fine-tuned the Conquest reward schedule to provide players with more variety and flexibility to get the kind of gear they’re looking for.<br />
<br />
Players who earn 500 Conquest points in a given week will receive one Quartermaster’s Coin and a piece of gear from that week’s selection. Players might also earn an additional piece of gear or Quartermaster’s Coin each week by using a weekly bonus roll token in PvP. 10 Quartermaster’s Coins can be exchanged for a Warlord’s Trophy, which players can use to upgrade a piece of Sinister Gladiator’s gear to a higher item level (based on their current Rated PvP bracket).<br />

Alliance PvP Season 2 Armor<br />
<br />
During weeks when the Conquest reward is a head, shoulder, or chest item, players can choose from one of four different pieces of Azerite gear. For the weeks when the Conquest reward is not an Azerite piece, trinket, or weapon, players will be able to choose gear from one of two different slots such as legs and wrists, hands and back, or finger and feet.<br />

Horde PvP Season 2 Armor<br />
<br />
The PvP reward UI will now show the criteria needed to receive your weekly chest. Elite sets (available to earn for a limited time only) can also be viewed in the Appearances interface under the Set tab.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ranked PvP Rewards<br />
We’ve also updated the naming conventions for the brackets. Now when players reach a 2400 rating in any bracket (2v2, 3v3, or 10v10 Rated Battlegrounds), they will be moved into the Elite bracket. Like other brackets, players will immediately be granted an achievement and title when reaching the bracket. Elite titles are class-specific, and players will receive a unique tabard for their collection.<br />

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elite&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2400+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
Sinister Gladiator Title<br />
The Gladiator title and achievement will now be earnable by winning 50 games above a 2400 rating in 3v3 Arena. Players in the top 0.1% at the end of the season in this bracket will earn the title Sinister Gladiator for Season 2.<br />

PvP Season 2 Alliance and Horde Mounts<br />
<br />
Season 2 Mounts<br />
During Battle for Azeroth Season 2, players can work toward claiming the Vicious Black Bonesteed or Vicious Black Warsaber. Once earned, players can fill the bar again to receive a Vicious Saddle, allowing them to purchase a mount from previous seasons.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye on the Player vs. Player Leaderboards during the season to follow who’s making waves at the top.</div></div><hr />

The Horde sets are amazing<br />
<br />
Btw this change still isn't what pvpers actually want... that is, some actual choice in the items they acquire like it used to be. spend x arena points to acquire y item. Good to see Blizzard are dead set against players have any control over their pvp gear</div></div><hr />

It was way better when it was just &quot;Cap conquest, spend points.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now you've got bracketed gear ilvls, conquest &quot;schedules&quot;, and quartermaster's coins.<br />

Less is more. Less complicated is better. Stop wasting time and resources fixing things that were working fine.</div></div><hr />

But you can do all of the conquest up to the current week even if you miss a week. You're not punished for missing a week. You could hit 120 the last few weeks of the season and grind out all 25 weeks if you're crazy enough to farm out 12500 conquest.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I might have to wait WEEKS, if not months for the piece of gear I need to upgrade.<br />
<br />
Just bring back pvp vendors Blizzard. I don't know why Blizz is so dumb to not do this. I run a pvp guild that is about to have an 11 year anniversary and we have been active through it all, the highs and the lows of this game. Holy F is this issue driving people away from this game. So many people in my guild have literally stopped playing because they don't see their next upgrade for 3 more weeks of unlocks. How stupid can you be Blizz? Just let us pick what piece of gear we want!</div></div><hr />

Horse is better looking, but not by that much. I liked both. And for the armor I liked the Alliance one a bit better. I'm quite tired of the bad guys look. <br />
We're more evil, that's why we have to hide behind glory and fame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is &quot;better&quot; looking is highly subjective, you might be playing for the wrong faction if you prefer skulls and death and shit.<br />

<br />
It's not about being simple. It's ALL ABOUT if you miss ONE week you won't have full set. SO KEEP PAYING!!<br />
<br />
You do know the cap carries over to the next week? So if you don't cap for, lets say 4 months. All those caps can be done from when you're back playing (as long as you're still in the same season of course).<br />
<br />
You can literally be unsubbed the whole season, come back the last week and get the whole set after one intense grindy week.</div></div><hr />

Are you even playing the game? You can do all missed previous weeks in 1 week later in the season.<br />

Why so much hate for a game you clearly not even play anymore/yet?</div></div><hr />

Did you vote for Trump, because in no world is the Alliance more evil than the Horde.<br />
<br />
The Horde gassed LIVING MEMBERS of their own faction. <br />
<br />
But OTOH you have Anduin who instead of just killing Saurfang, captured him, and then released him later. Come on... Don't say demonstrably dumb shit, that can just be proven as dumb. Not trying to attack you, but from what you said, it's literally making my head hurt.</div></div><hr />

Do I need to pvp this week in order to get the 375 weapon next week? Or do I pvp next week to get the 375 weapon next week? Or do I pvp next week in order to get the 375 in two weeks? Sorry, I don't know how the pvp system works.</div></div><hr />

Is there a reason why horde has the better looking mounts usually always? Bad guys get the coolest stuff? Except alliance seems to be more &quot;evil&quot; than horde.<br />
<br />
Because Horde get better everything?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rogueMatthias</div><div class="date">2019-01-18, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, imo the Horde gladiator set is one of the coolest sets for a rogue in game. <br />
<br />
I've been crying out for some more dark leather sets where we aren't just lit up like a Christmas tree. Gutted that this one (and the S1 Aspirant set) are Horde only. <br />
<br />
Alliance rogues get more fluorescent purple and bright gold instead. YAY! Very stealthy.</div></div><hr />
