Shattrath / Dalaran Portals Removed<br />
Portals are removed as we don't want you to have your hearth in an old city from an expansion you've outgrown just so you can have quick and instant travel anywhere you like. Those expansions had content that was far removed from things like auction houses and class trainers, and thus, contained portals. They were removed from those things because we didn't want the expansion content (which would hold the bulk of the playerbase) to in turn also remove them from the classic Azeroth world. That's no longer the case. Cataclysm has content near your faction capitals, which have auction houses and class trainers.<br />
<br />
And for new characters leveling, who will eventually hit Shattrath and Dalaran, they now have auction houses and class trainers in place of portals.<br />
<br />
As soon as you can fly in Azeroth this really does cease to be an issue. It will not be much different than flying from Borean Tundra to Ulduar.<br />
<br />
I can see that since the OP is buried that enough people disagree with this being an issue, and for that I'm at least thankful that I'm not fighting a complete uphill battle in explaining it. ;) <br />
<br />
[...] It's the first day, the first few HOURS, of course something new is going to be jarring.<br />
<br />
But worse yet is that the entire plan isn't unveiled, there's no flying in the old world, there's none of the new content. The one thing I do agree with is that ideally portals shouldn't have been removed until the 7th, but that would have meant a ton of additional development time just to give an extra two weeks of insta-porting goodness.<br />
<br />
One benefit is you don't encourage all of the current re-rollers to hearth in the Shattrath or Dalaran, and then pull it away on Cataclysm launch. That seems like a worse scenario, actually.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt that this, like so many other topics that spring up day 1 of a patch, will die a quiet death once people actually play and see how it affects them instead of simply estimating. That's not going to happen until Cataclysm in this case, though. Such are the growing pains of expansion life. <br />

Darkmoon Faire Fortune Unlocks<br />
Alliance 30% Loot Discovered<br />
<br />
Many of Sayge's dark prophecies have already come to pass. The world is shattered and its inhabitants' way of life on the brink of collapse. And even in these times, the treacherous Horde have carried out a series of murderous assaults on the noble peoples of the Alliance. But the Alliance remain strong... just. Claim your latest reward and prove your ability to persevere, as far greater riches await you.<br />

Horde 30% Treasure Revealed<br />
<br />
Adherents to the Horde way, you remain steadfast in the face of the Alliance's gathering forces. They too seek greater riches in this time of peril, but it is time to bask once again in the glory of claiming what is rightfully yours. Take to heart Sayge's warnings, continue to share the many treasures of the Darkmoon Faire, and you will be victorious. Lok'tar ogar!<br />

Blue Posts<br />
DPS Meta Gem requirements changes<br />
The current design has been reconsidered, so we're planning to revert gems that now require more blue than red gems back to their original requirements. Such a change can't be accomplished via a hotfix though, so we'll have to wait to revert these in a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/136970/dps-meta-gem-changechange-it-back))<br />
<br />
Shattering release before the Expansion<br />
From a production standpoint, it makes a lot more sense to release such sweeping changes to the world before the expansion itself is released so we can ensure everything is running smoothly. We want to make sure the process of activating Cataclysm-exclusive content is as easy and smooth as possible.<br />
<br />
This content spent a great deal of time in testing environments, but the best way to know things are functioning correctly is to implement these data changes on all live realms. There actually is a lot of new content and things to see for players out there right now too (unless you prefer sitting in Dalaran at level 80 all night).<br />
<br />
It's kind of win/win. You get a sizable chunk of Cataclysm content in a free content patch two weeks prior to launch, and we get two weeks to make sure any remaining kinks are ironed out. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/136972/the-shattering-is-xmas-without-the-presents))<br />

Race changes before December 7th<br />
Will this be the same as for when Goblins and Worgen come out? If i buy a race change NOW will i be able to just save it and use it on DEC 7th to change to a goblin?<br />
I've been told that if you buy a race change now you can simply wait until the new race/class combos are available to use it. I don't see why that wouldn't also apply to goblin/worgen, but I haven't seen specific confirmation.<br />
<br />
If it's comforting, when you click the button to change race you can actually cancel out and not use it. When you click on the button you're not forced to use the race change request right then and there. In any case I guess my point is you could cancel out and seek further assistance. <br />
<br />
City Tabards do not give reputations<br />
This is a bug we will be hotfixing in the very near future. The city tabards should currently work in old Azeroth dungeons (as well as Cataclysm 80-85 dungeons when the expansion is released). The hotfix will make it so these tabards work for Heroic and normal Northrend dungeons, however, there are no plans as of yet to apply this change to Outland dungeons.

Yes, this is pretty lame. I could understand a mangle nerf.. I mean it hits reasonably hard (you know, still not as hard as any other tanks main attack, but still fairly hard), but the others?<br />
<br />
Maul is a bag of nails and hits for very little despite costing 20 rage<br />
Lacerate hits like a wet noodle<br />
Pulverize is ok if you have a 3 stack of lacerate, but lacerate.. see above<br />
Swipe is a bag of nails with a cooldown<br />
and well I'm still waiting for Thrash for the verdict on that.<br />

Weird, it seems to work just fine for druids as I saw some lv80 Troll bears last night; that's a bug and should be fixed soon.</div></div><hr />

I assume it probably works for those who have Faction changed from Alliance Druid to Horde Troll Druid but if your already on Horde i dont think the Race change is working correctly. =(</div></div><hr />

Swipe hits for around 700-900 at 250 AIL. AE threat is tab target lacerate at this point.<br />

After 4.0 it became a tab-target game for bear tanks. No more swipe spam :( Oh well, now it's time for drood tanks to learn, like warrior tanks, how to tank without aoe's :)<br />

No, flying is not in yet. You cannot fly in Azeroth, we're still limited to Outland and Northrend at this time.<br />
<br />
This is why removing the Dalaran and Shattrath portals is utter BS...in a blue post a dev admitted that it would have been more ideal to roll out the portals loss on the 7th, but it was a logistical issue to implement it then. No clue, sounds like crap to me.<br />
<br />
Until Cata we have nothing to do with 80s in Azeroth except for explore the new maps (on the ground); all the current dailies, raids, and dungeons are located in Northrend. I suppose the fishing daily in Org can be done by 80s too, haven't looked. I think there's a cooking quest there as well, again, haven't looked. I'm sure there's an alliance equivalent for both of those probably in SW.<br />
<br />
Anyway - TL;DR: NO FLYING YET, PORTALS GONE=BS</div></div><hr />

The race change worked for me as well not sure whats going on with other people. I do have the answer to your question there's going to be another patch next week I believe that is a polishing patch, the Bat form model isn't actually implemented yet nor is the new Tree of life or Moonkin. So until then we get the good old boring Tauren flight form.</div></div><hr />

They might as well say that because you really have no reason to travel there anymore as a L81+ we are removing access all together for those chars. I have had lots of reasons to travel to them both including the old world before. An easy example is how much of a pain it will be do get the achievements for anything that has a lot of traveling like The Elders. I mean with the portals it was still a pain now even more so.<br />
<br />
What I would have done is add in portals in every major city the rational was with the attacks of elementals and Deathwing the portal were set up as to allow reinforcements to be moved from one city to another as needed. I would also add in portal to Dalaran from Shattrath.<br />
<br />
If you then go what about the poor poor mages I would say their spells are not general needed unless in a situation where your hearth is down anyways. I would also add why is it any class should be given a skill that could be vital for everyday gaming experience? What next? Mages no longer can make food that’s now going to Warlock and oh BTW you can no longer buy food anywhere? If you insist they have these and they would be useless with all these city portals then do it this way:<br />
<br />
Either make all the cities that they can access non capitols, Like Methenil Bay, Nijals Point, ect, or Make it that every expansion they get several of the questing hub cities in their lineup. Make it much like Dalaran was in that they have to make it there to learn the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maul is a bag of nails and hits for very little despite costing 20 rage<br />
Lacerate hits like a wet noodle<br />
Pulverize is ok if you have a 3 stack of lacerate, but lacerate.. see above<br />
Swipe is a bag of nails with a cooldown<br />
and well I'm still waiting for Thrash for the verdict on that.<br />
<br />
Add this to our 10k less health this patch<br />
<br />
I totally agree. I just signed up so I could comment on this post. I could handle the mangle and honestly, I kind of saw that coming. But nerfing everything else... seriously? They just went and nerfed every ability we (bears) use! I really do not see why they saw a need to nerf down anything besides mangle. Nerfing lacerate to the dirt is just laughable at this point. Damage wise we are not THAT OP that they needed to flat nerf all of our abilities by 17%. Blizz might as well be giving us a middle finger as far as I am concerned.</div></div><hr />

TBH I'm surprised the servers were up at 11. That must be a first, so kudos for that. If that means race changes have to wait a bit longer, then that's fine with me - as far as I'm concerned they did an excellent job at making their own server uptime deadline.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm not one to whine about changes, but the portal thing is REALLY annoying. Especially with Pilgrim's Bounty going on. :&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to go to Dalaran you have the Kirin Tor ring or the Argent Tournament tabard if that is on cooldown.<br />
If you want to go to Stormwind you will get a teleport to there as a guild perk once guild levelling is implemented.<br />
This frees you up to set your hearthstone in whatever zone you are currently questing in, when, once in a while you need to get a class trainer, bank or AH you can go to one of those two cities and then hearthstone back.<br />
<br />
Once you get used to this system you will spend less time travelling than you did up to now, you can always get to one of two major cities, with class trainers, banks, AHs etc and you can always hearthstone back to where you were before. It is actually a much better system since it frees up your hearthstone. It doesn't really work until the guild teleports are implemented though.<br />
<br />
The only place that is awkward to get to is outland but if you really absolutely have to have a quick way to get there you can get an engineering teleport or the portal to Black Temple from the Blessed Medallion of Karabor (I assume this is still available in the game).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death Knights aren't the godly AoE tanks they use to be, either. When I am tanking as my blood DK I do some AoE initially and then I tab target if I am running with remotely competent DPS.<br />
<br />
I don't know about Paladins, but I assume their AoE was tuned down so they'll be tab-targeting as well.<br />
<br />
As long as classes are being adjusted equally (with respect to general strategy) then nobody should have cause for QQ.<br />

<br />
I don't find Outlands all that bad to get to now. Every major faction capitol has a portal to Blasted Lands and it is a very short jog to Hellfire. Hellfire is relatively centered when it comes to Outlands, so it doesn't take long to fly anywhere from the Dark Portal.<br />
<br />
Northrend is more of a pain in the butt because it is only fast to get to from Stormwind or Ironforge for Alliance ... especially Stormwind. Of course, you have to wait on the boat to come in and then ride the boat for a bit before docking at either end of Northrend. If you take to boat to Howling Fjord it will take you awhile to fly to Icecrown. Everything I said applies to the Horde as well, because the only two Northrend-accessible cities are Orgrimmar and Undercity.<br />
<br />
Outlands, to me, is much more accessible than Northrend, especially if you prefer to hang out in Darnassus, Exodar (HAHAH ... no really... HAHAH), Thunderbluff, or Silvermoon City.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up about the Ring of the Kirin Tor, though. I had completely forgot about that ring being in the game. I never thought it worthwhile to buy, but I may pick one up just to have a quick port to Northrend for future nostalgic runs and achievements.</div></div><hr />
