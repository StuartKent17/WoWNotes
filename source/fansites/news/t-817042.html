Apparently, Blizzard accidentally the whole arena season. <br />
As many of you are aware there was an issue which allowed players to reach unexpectedly high Match Making Values. While that issue has since been resolved, we're taking steps to control what occurred while it was active.<br />
<br />
<br />
All existing items requiring 2200 rating will have their minimum level requirement temporarily increased to make those items unusable. This change is currently planned to be reverted on January 25.<br />
Weapons which require a 2200 rating will be unavailable for purchase. This limitation is also planned for reversion on January 25.<br />
All player and team ratings for arenas will be reduced to a maximum of 1500. (Player, team and matchmaking ratings below 1500 will not be affected)<br />
Match Making Values for all players will be set to 1500.<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition, the &quot;best week rating&quot; will be reduced to a maximum of 1500 to match the rating change, which will in turn be used to determine next week's max weekly Conquest Points. The maximum Conquest Points given for next week will be set to 1343 to match the number that would be obtainable with a rating of 1500.<br />
<br />
<br />
Non-Crafters can no longer roll on Chaos Orbs<br />
This is a bug. A hotfix was applied about an hour ago that changes it so Chaos Orbs will only be available for Need rolls by characters with Tailoring, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Engineering (minimum skill of 425 required). This fix may not appear until the next time realms are restarted, which is likely to be early tomorrow morning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Hotfixes - December 21<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />

This exactly. There are so few skinnable mobs compared to previous expansions to start with, now they nerf this.<br />
Engineering doesn't drop Volatile Air any more when skinning.<br />
Pristine Hide rate was nerfed to hell.<br />
Every LW pattern takes 10 Heavy Savage Leather to even buy.<br />

There have always been an abundance of creatures that you could kill and skin, and thus this particular prof. was &quot;easier&quot; than others to level.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithers, JC's etc. etc. needs to fight over ore, alchemysts and insciptionists needs to fight over the flowers, the &quot;nerf&quot; in creatures, that are able to be skinned is getting the prof. into line with similar prof's.</div></div><hr />

WTB insane, impossible and LOLGLHF as 3 new and tougher difficulties so the millions of us actually <br />

That is sooooooo retarded... I dont care about the reset... I really dont care even tho I got 2900 rating in 3s. But with that change they force pvpers to be behind in gear once again.. Some guilds already have some heroics raid bosses down so they can use 372 weapons. Why would I have to wait 1 month later then them.. This is increadibly dumb.<br />
<br />
They simply have to reset the rating like they are doing and then people have to get back there. Why does pvpers would have to wait 34 days to get Tier 2 weapons?? This is such a huge mistake...<br />

Actually, nobody's rating was legit. You might of been playing a 2500 team that only got that rating due to the bug, hence you would have got lots of points for beating a weaker team with a higher rating than yourself.</div></div><hr />

WTF are you talking about? ONLY crafters can even see the orb to roll on it so if you arent, you wont get the chance to roll. Period. Just like if a boss drops a jc pattern and you are a blacksmith, you dont even see the item to get a chance to roll on it, only the jcs in the group do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too hard :S? that can't be right...<br />
<br />
The right way to tank this boss is to make sure his stack never drops and you can easily do that by running in and out of the lavafall quickly before it runs out.<br />
These nerfs must have come from countless whiners who let the stack drop and/or kill the imps to get the debuff up which is the wrong way and just makes the fight alot harder than it should be. Shame on Blizzard here to be honest.</div></div><hr />

Wiping conquest points? Are you serious...And those who didnt even do arenas but rated BG's could go and fuck them selfs right?<br />

<br />
You are wrong. It is about gear if you prefer to pvp over raids. Getting higher tier gear is the only way to stay competitive. This is just one more showing of how they want anyone that can run through pve to be better at pvp. It's silly. If they want they can just remove all tier 2 and give a refund or something. Making them not available just isn't right though. I'm really sick and tired of being told I have to pve to stay competitive in pvp. Don't say it isn't like that, because it is. Sure skill makes up for a large part of it, but you can't dismiss gear. <br />

So you're finding the encounters too easy now? I've got an idea. Downgrade your gear. Go back to all Greens and do the heroics. That should give your leet self a challenge. Once you do that and you find that too easy, go back to level 70 gear and do them. Prove to the world how cool you really are by doing these heroics in less and less gear.</div></div><hr />

a) i had no idea points were messed up. me and my buddy just grinded our 1343 conquest points, we didnt get to like 2500 or anything. i just thought, (not surprisingly) that blizzard had made it ridiculously easy to obtain the arena gear this time around. didnt think there was any lack of legitimacy behind it. if i had have got a 2500 rating i clearly would have realized it was broken, but i didnt. so i got my vicious gladiators gavel and vendored my heroic wep, + put a 1k gold enchant on the gavel. so now wtf do i do?<br />

b) LOL at the archaeology change and everyone who already got 525 a long time ago.<br />

<br />
Because from a software development standpoint it looks like this: &quot;I have two bugs, one is serious, but requires man-days worth of work to fix. Once is minor, but only requires me to change a flag value and will take 45 seconds.&quot; Which one you think I'm going to tackle first? Even if I assign two guy to tackle the serious bug, and one guy to handle a big bunch of the little bugs how many little bugs do you think that guy can fix before the two guys get the big one worked out? Software development still isn't magic. Differing problems have differing levels of complexity, and easy things often get fixed before hard things. Assigning (x) more people to a problem doesn't result in it being fixed (x) faster.<br />
<br />
Often with subtle bugs the hard part is figuring out what the problem is. I can't count how many times I've spend hours staring at a piece of code or a config file, only to finally see the issue and fix it in thirty seconds. You can't even make estimates for fixes like that. Will I see the issue after I've stared at it for an hour? A day? I dunno, but once I see it it'll be fixed pretty fast.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, get over yourself. If you're so hardcore and great at this game, then I high doubt you need to be running through Heroics anymore. Let the &quot;casuals&quot; have the content and go do heroic raids for your virtual pat on the back.<br />
<br />
They will still QQ that heroics are too easy in their heroic raid gear. Honestly, if you been running the crap out of heroics and have a bunch of badge gear...they're going to get easy. A year from now these will all be facerolls again because of out gearing. And we will be still hearing the &quot;OMG casuals and bads are ruining MY game. ITS MY GAME.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I'm really glad they made Fungalmancer Glop give credit to everyone on his threat list since, on my server at least, every single time you went there, 5 people were waiting. The original quest alone took me 3 tries because on both the first and second time, another player tagged him despite the fact I started the event and they either refused to group with me or were horde.</div></div><hr />

i would say go check out his/her thread reguarding this horrible horrible end of the world nerf for some but i wont because you will be feeding a troll.<br />
It too makes me laugh when these dicks moan about places that wont mean jack shit to them within a few weeks, once a dick always a dick tbh, i mean first people moan about normal stuff then heroics and it dam wont be long before you see him/her/...it?+ elitist bumchums complaining that raids will be nerfed(even though by that time these morons will have moved on to higher tiers/raids etc). Some people are only ever happy when it benefits them only....fuck the rest attitude and its quite comical that they accuse the casuals of such nerfs when blizzard clearly put in the blue post 'it went against OUR intended fight mechanics' not 'it went against the casuals intended fight mechanics' .<br />
Although the above mentioned thread that was made was quite funny seems as most of the responses that people made clearly wasnt what he was looking for hahaha , maybe mmo should open up there oown subforum so they can all suck each others dicks while the rest of us sit back have a good time and laugh.</div></div><hr />

If the user base was only the 'above average user', their user base would be so much smaller and WoW would have such a limited development budget.</div></div><hr />

Once is minor, but only requires me to change a flag value and will take 45 seconds.&quot; Which one you think I'm going to tackle first? Even if I assign two guy to tackle the serious bug, and one guy to handle a big bunch of the little bugs how many little bugs do you think that guy can fix before the two guys get the big one worked out? Software development still isn't magic. Differing problems have differing levels of complexity, and easy things often get fixed before hard things. Assigning (x) more people to a problem doesn't result in it being fixed (x) faster.<br />
<br />
Often with subtle bugs the hard part is figuring out what the problem is. I can't count how many times I've spend hours staring at a piece of code or a config file, only to finally see the issue and fix it in thirty seconds. You can't even make estimates for fixes like that. Will I see the issue after I've stared at it for an hour? A day? I dunno, but once I see it it'll be fixed pretty fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have worked on writing code then you know when we are tracking down an error we don't go rewriting other code. You concentrate and work on one thing at a time. In this case they are ignoring real bugs in order to concentrate on crap. Why is this still acceptable? Blizz used to be a company that was all about quality. Yet now most players not only expect rampant bugs, but most players accept them. They just say it's part of the game, and they go on about their business. Just more of the same though, they continue to ignore bugs and people continue to just expect it.<br />
<br />
I will give you a list of what should be easy bugs to fix. <br />
<br />
Shields displaying on the sides of a person<br />
Weapons displaying on the sides of a person<br />
the quest chain phase where you hear thralls balls in VJ can break if you are hunter with a pet, or a shifted druid. They already have in game the ability to dismiss pets/shift youw hy not use it? <br />
<br />
All three of those should be really damn easy to fix. Yet I wonder how long they will be in the game because they are too busy &quot;fixing&quot; things like that.</div></div><hr />

If you're personally working on your little project you try to isolate bugs like that. If you have 150 people working on a 1200 bug punch-list you assign people to fix them. Some people work faster, some bugs are easier to fix, Bob is sick today so his punch-list didn't get worked on, this bug is going to potentially break other stuff so it needs more testing, Greg *really* hates that purple fog and Greg is the boss, so that got moved higher on the priority list than it probably should have... There's any number of reasons things happen in the order they do on a project this large. They're not just going to have everybody focus on one bug, or have everyone else stop work while a particular bug is being worked (unless the bug is game breaking, and I haven't seen or heard of any game breaking bugs out there right now).<br />

You know how easy these bug are.. how? You have a remarkable familiarity with the code for someone who's never seen it. I'm not saying these bugs *are* hard to fix... they may or may not be, but I sure as Hell don't know. Maybe they tried dismissing pets and it didn't fix the problem, or it caused a new problem. Your first and second bug don't sound all that serious. I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but if it's just a graphics glitch it's probably no more or less serious than the purple fog in my book.</div></div><hr />

To see common sense and posting by someone who actual knows what it's like to work in a software company; I applaud this. Some people have no idea how even what appear to be small changes can cost in man-hours in QA.

Hey, guys. I hear that they totally only have ONE guy who does all the bug fixing, right? I also hear that they can only release one hotfix a month, right?<br />
<br />
Get a grip and learn about how software development works.<br />
<br />
This is exactly why no one cares about MMO-Champion - the majority of posters do nothing but complain over stupid things that they don't even understand. :/<br />
<br />
To recap: Yes, they are working on things. No, heroics haven't been nerfed. Yes, you should move on to raids if heroics are &quot;too easy&quot;, Yes, you should quit whining and enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />
