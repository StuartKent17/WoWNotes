Diablo 3 Auction House Announced - Spend and Earn Real Life Money!<br />
The Diablo 3 Auction House was announced during last week's press tour and I'm sure that news will be very interesting for most of the readers of this site, because most of us wonder if it will have any effect on the evolution of WoW in the long run. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/july/Auction-House_Selling_Cash_small2.jpg<br />
<br />
Diablo 3's Auction House will feature two currencies, the first one will be in-game gold and the 2nd one will be real life money. Yep, you read it right, Diablo 3 will let you buy items with either gold or real life money! It's also worth noting that you will also be able to sell loot for money, and transfer that money outside the game. I guess gold farming just got interesting. <br />
<br />
See the screenshots and official FAQ below for more information.<br />

<br />
Diablo 3 Auction House - Overview<br />
We’re introducing a powerful auction house system that will provide a safe, fun, and easy-to-use way for players to buy and sell the loot they obtain in the game. Items can be sold and purchased using real-world money or in-game gold.<br />
<br />
An Easier Way To Trade<br />
Sure, slaying monsters, demons, and cultists is a surefire way to obtain a ton of random new loot in Diablo III, but with the new auction house feature, it’ll be easier than ever to gear up your character with the exact items you’re looking for. You can also post the items you don’t need for players who are desperately searching for what you’ve got!<br />
<br />
Don’t Need It? Put It Up For Auction!<br />
Nearly everything found in the game, including gold, can be exchanged with other players directly or through the auction house system. So say you’re a witch doctor and you’ve just found an incredibly rare, incredibly powerful axe that only barbarians can use. In the previous Diablo games your best option might have been to sell the axe to an in-game vendor, but in Diablo III, you now have the ability to list that axe in the auction house for your fellow barbarian players to bid on. And you know another player will probably appreciate the true value of that axe more than some heartless vendor who’ll likely just melt it down for scrap….<br />
<br />
Amazing Search Functionality<br />
The auction house’s &quot;smart search&quot; functionality can automatically sort items in the auction house based on which upgrades would be most beneficial to your character. Also, searching for the best gear for multiple characters on the same Battle.net account can be done all from the same interface without having to log out.<br />
<br />
The Choice Is Yours<br />
Use of either the real-money or gold-based auction house is completely optional -- that decision can be made on a per-item basis, and both versions of the auction house are functionally the same. In addition, players have the option to simply sell the items they obtain to in-game vendors for gold. They can also trade items to other players through a direct character-to-character trading system in the game in exchange for gold, other items, or just an overwhelming sense of goodwill.<br />
<br />
Players Only<br />
Blizzard does not plan to post items for sale in the auction house. The driving purpose of the auction house is to provide players with a fun additional in-game option for what they do with the items they obtain in the game. Items sold in the auction house will be posted by players and purchased by players.<br />
<br />
Safe and Sanctified<br />
The real-money auction house provides players with an easy-to-use, Blizzard-sanctioned way to collect money for items they obtain while playing Diablo III. It also helps protect players from the scams and theft often associated with questionable third-party sites by providing a secure, completely in-game method for purchasing and obtaining the items they want for their characters. <br />
<br />
Faster Than A Seven-Sided Strike<br />
Sellers can post items for auction from any of the Diablo III characters on their Battle.net account, or from their shared stash (extra inventory space accessible with any of the characters on their account), without logging out. And after a buyer has won an auction, the item will become immediately available to be equipped and put to good use in the ongoing struggle against the forces of the Burning Hells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 Auction House - FAQ<br />
What is the Diablo III auction house system? <br />
Acquiring epic new gear for your characters has always been a big part of the Diablo experience. Because of this, players have found a number of different ways to trade and otherwise obtain items both within and outside of the game. Many of these methods were inconvenient and either tedious (for example, repeatedly advertising for a desired trade in Battle.net chat channels and waiting for responses) or unsafe (e.g., giving credit card information to third-party trading sites). With Diablo III, we’re introducing a powerful auction house system that will provide a safe, fun, and easy-to-use way for players to buy and sell the loot they find in the game, such as weapons, armor, and runestones. Two different versions of the auction house will be available in Diablo III: one based on in-game gold, which players acquire through their adventures, and one based on real-world currency.<br />
<br />
What’s the difference between the gold-based auction house and the currency-based auction house?<br />
The gold-based auction house uses in-game gold for purchases and sales. With the currency-based auction house, players will be able to conduct these transactions using actual currency from an authorized payment method or from funds that have been added to their Battle.net account. Players can choose to participate in whichever version of the auction house they prefer, on a per-transaction basis.<br />
<br />
How does the auction house system work?<br />
Players can open the auction house interface from anywhere in the game to make purchases or list items for sale. Items can be sold from the shared stash (storage shared among all the characters on your Battle.net account) or from any individual character’s inventory. When posting the item, the seller picks whether it will be sold in the gold-based auction house or the currency-based auction house. The item is then held by the auction house system until the listing expires or a purchase is made. Items that are not sold are returned to the seller’s shared stash, and items that are sold are delivered to the winning bidder’s shared stash. In either case, the auction house system will deduct a nominal fixed transaction fee from the seller, the amount of which is determined by whether or not the item was sold (see below). For the currency-based auction house, players will have a few different options for how to pay for item purchases and receive funds for item sales, as discussed elsewhere in this FAQ. There may be differences in how this system will work in different regions of the world. We’ll provide further details at a later date.<br />
<br />
How is the transaction fee determined?<br />
A nominal fixed transaction fee will be deducted from the seller for each item listed in the auction house. This fee consists of a fixed charge to list the item, which is assessed whether or not the item is successfully sold, and an additional fixed charge that is assessed only if the item is sold. Because the listing portion of the fee is charged even if the item doesn’t sell, it will be in the seller’s interest to list items he or she believes other players will be interested in, and to do so at a competitive price. Specific details related to the transaction fee for the currency-based auction house will vary by region and will be announced at a later date.<br />
<br />
Please note that we plan to waive the listing portion of the fee for a limited number of transactions per account. In other words, for these transactions, the seller will only pay a transaction fee if the item is successfully sold, and that fee will not include the listing charge. We’ll have further details on this as well at a later date.<br />
<br />
Why are you creating a currency-based version of the auction house?<br />
Our goal with all of our games is to ensure players have a highly enjoyable, rewarding, and secure experience. Acquiring items has always been an important part of the Diablo series, but the previous games have not had a robust, centralized system for facilitating trades, and as a result players have turned to inconvenient and potentially unsafe alternatives, such as third-party real-money-trading organizations. Many of the transactions between players and these organizations led to a poor player experience and countless customer-service issues involving scams and item/account theft, to name a few. To that end, we wanted to create a convenient, powerful, and fully integrated tool to meet the demand of players who wished to purchase or sell items for real-world currency, and who would likely have turned to a less-secure third-party service for this convenience.<br />
<br />
How will the currency-based auction house work?<br />
Players will be able to make purchases in the currency-based auction house using a registered form of payment attached to their Battle.net account. As with other popular online-purchase services, players will also have the option to charge up their Battle.net account with a balance of funds that can be drawn from for purchases of any digital product available through Battle.net -- this includes not only auction house items but also things like World of Warcraft subscription time and paid services, to name a few examples. On the flipside, when players sell an item in the currency-based auction house, the proceeds of the sale are deposited into their Battle.net account and can then be used as described above. Note that this process might be different for certain regions; we’ll provide further region-specific details as we get closer to launch.<br />
<br />
Can players choose to get cash from currency-based auction house sales, instead of having the proceeds deposited into their Battle.net account?<br />
Yes, as an advanced feature, players will have the option of attaching an account with an approved third-party payment service to their Battle.net account. Once this has been completed, proceeds from the sale of items in the currency-based auction house can be deposited into their third-party payment service account. “Cashing out” would then be handled through the third-party payment service. Note that this process will be subject to applicable fees charged by Blizzard and the third-party payment service. Also, any proceeds from the sale of items in the currency-based auction house that have been deposited into the Battle.net account will not be transferrable to the third-party payment service account. Not all regions will support this advanced feature at launch. Region-specific details, as well as details regarding which third-party payment services will be supported and the fee that Blizzard will charge for the cash-out process, will all be provided at a later date.<br />
<br />
Is the currency-based version of the auction house optional?<br />
Yes, the currency-based auction house is available as an option for players who wish to purchase or sell Diablo III items for real money. Players are also able to buy and sell items through the gold-based auction house, and they can trade items with each other as well through direct character-to-character in-game trading.<br />
<br />
Why would I want to pay real money to buy or sell in-game items?<br />
Acquiring items has always been a core part of the Diablo series' appeal. With the previous Diablo games, many players have shown a great interest in buying, selling, or exchanging items for their characters using real-world currency, turning to potentially unsafe avenues to accomplish this goal. The currency-based version of the auction house provides players with an easy-to-use, Blizzard-sanctioned way to collect money for items obtained while playing Diablo III. In addition, it helps protect players from scams and disreputable third-party sites by providing a secure, in-game method to search for and purchase items posted by other players that are a perfect fit for their character and play style. <br />
<br />
The currency-based auction house is completely optional. Players who aren't interested in paying real money for items will still be able to rely on items they acquire through their own adventures, and they'll also be able to trade with friends and use the full-featured gold-based auction house.<br />
<br />
Can I play on a server without a currency-based version of the auction house?<br />
We want to provide a secure, fun environment for our players to purchase and sell in-game items using gold or real money and have no plans to divide the community. Players are free to participate in the gold-based auction house or the currency-based auction house, or to opt out of using any of the auction houses at all, progressing through Diablo III using only the items they obtain through their own adventures or direct trade with other players. <br />
<br />
Does Blizzard plan to post weapons, armor, and other such items for sale in the currency-based version of the auction house?<br />
The currency-based auction house is a place for players to purchase or sell items they’ve obtained within the game. Blizzard does not plan to post items that affect gameplay, such as gear or character-enhancing runestones, for sale in the auction house. <br />
<br />
Will Blizzard sell anything directly through the auction house?<br />
We don't have any plans at this time to post items for sale in the auction house.<br />
<br />
Does the currency-based auction house signify a shift in Blizzard’s business and revenue model?<br />
We’ve always tailored our business models to match what we’ve felt would be most appropriate and effective for each game and in each region, and that’s the case with Diablo III as well. The item-based nature of Diablo gameplay has always lent itself to an active trade-based ecosystem, and a significant part of this trade has been conducted through unsecure third-party organizations. This has led to numerous customer-service and game-experience issues that we’ve needed to account for. Our primary goal with the Diablo III auction house system is for it to serve as the foundation for a player-driven economy that’s safe, fun, and accessible for everyone.<br />
<br />
What’s Blizzard’s cut?<br />
As with other online auction sites and real-world auction houses, our fee structure will vary by region. However, we plan to collect a nominal fixed transaction fee for each item listed in the auction house. This fee consists of a fixed charge to list the item, which is assessed whether or not the item is successfully sold, and an additional fixed charge that is assessed only if the item is sold. The listing portion of the fee, which helps encourage sensible listing prices and discourage the mass posting of items that are very low quality or would be of little interest to other players, will be waived for a limited number of transactions per account. For players who opt to have the proceeds of their auction house sales go to their third-party payment service account instead of to their Battle.net account, Blizzard will collect a separate “cash-out” fee. Specific details regarding these fees will be announced at a later date.<br />
<br />
Why would I even want to use the gold-based auction house?<br />
We recognize that not all players would prefer or have the means to participate in the currency-based auction house, and it was important to us to provide these players with a full-featured alternative. <br />
<br />
Can we buy gold from the currency-based auction house?<br />
Players will be able to buy and sell gold through the currency-based auction house at whatever the current market price is, as established by the player community.<br />
<br />
If I no longer need an item I bought in the auction house, can I relist it in the auction house?<br />
Yes. Once you've purchased an item you can do anything with it that you could if you had acquired it through your own adventures, whether that be using it yourself, or, after a cool-down period, trading it to another character or relisting it on either the gold-based or currency-based auction house. In fact, you can generally do any combination of these things -- for example, you can purchase an item in the auction house, use it for a while, and then relist it or trade it to another character. Aside from certain quest items, there will be very few (if any) items that will be “soulbound” to your character and therefore untradable. Please note that the duration of the cool-down period mentioned above will be discussed at a later date.<br />
<br />
<br />
AUCTION HOUSE FUNCTIONALITY<br />
<br />
What items can be traded in Diablo III?<br />
Nearly everything that drops on the ground, including gold, can be traded with other players directly or through the auction house system. Aside from certain quest items, there will be very few (if any) items that will be “soulbound” to your character and therefore untradable. We are also planning to allow players to buy and sell characters in the auction house at some point in the future and will have more details to share on that at a later date.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;smart searching&quot;?<br />
When players launch the auction house interface, they’ll be able to select any Diablo III character associated with their Battle.net account. The &quot;smart search&quot; feature will assess which item slots have available upgrades and will sort items available in the auction house based on which upgrades would be most beneficial to the character. You can also search for specific stats to match the requirements of a particular character build.<br />
<br />
How does bidding work?<br />
Players will be able to place a current bid as well as a maximum bid if they wish to engage in automatic bidding. In addition, they’ll be able to check the status of their bids on the &quot;Currently Winning&quot; page and the &quot;Outbid&quot; page in the auction house interface.<br />
<br />
Can I buyout items that I want to purchase immediately?<br />
Yes, the Diablo III auction houses will support a buyout feature as well as standard bids.<br />
<br />
How do I pay for items?<br />
For the gold-based auction house, purchases will be made using in-game gold. For the currency-based auction house, players can make purchases using a registered form of payment attached to their Battle.net account. As with other popular online-purchase services, players will also have the option to charge up their Battle.net account with a balance of funds that can be drawn from for purchasing items in the currency-based auction house. Note that this process might be different for certain regions; we’ll provide further region-specific details as we get closer to launch.<br />
<br />
How do I receive the items I’ve won?<br />
After winning an auction, the item will be available to pick up through the built-in auction house interface in the Diablo III client. Players will then be able to immediately send that item to their shared stash (storage shared among all the characters on a Battle.net account) or repost the item in the auction house after a cool-down period. The duration of the cool-down period will be discussed at a later date.<br />
<br />
How do I sell items?<br />
From the auction house interface, players will be able to select items from their shared stash or from a specific character's inventory. They will then be able to post items for sale by listing a starting bid and buyout price.<br />
<br />
How do I cash out from the currency-based auction house?<br />
As an advanced feature, players will have the option of attaching an account with an approved third-party payment service to their Battle.net account. Once this has been completed, proceeds from the sale of items in the currency-based auction house can be deposited into their third-party payment service account. “Cashing out” would then be handled through the third-party payment service. Note that this process will be subject to applicable fees charged by Blizzard and the third-party payment service. Also, any proceeds from the sale of items in the currency-based auction house that have been deposited into the Battle.net account will not be transferrable to the third-party payment service account. Not all regions will support this advanced feature at launch. Region-specific details, as well as details regarding which third-party payment services will be supported and the fee that Blizzard will charge for the cash-out process, will all be provided at a later date.<br />
<br />
Will buying or selling items in the auction house reveal my identity?<br />
No. All player transactions in the gold-based and currency-based auction houses will be anonymous, and neither your real name nor your character name will be revealed to other players.<br />
<br />
Will there be a mobile or Web-based auction house?<br />
We're always on the lookout for opportunities to enhance the game experience and keep our community connected to our games through the Web or mobile devices. However, we do not have any plans to share along those lines at this time.<br />
<br />
When will this be available for testing? <br />
We'll share more information on our auction house testing plans as we get closer to launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
REGIONAL AUCTION HOUSE DETAILS<br />
<br />
Which regions will have currency-based auction house support?<br />
We plan to roll out the currency-based version of the auction house in as many regions as possible with the launch of Diablo III. In regions where the currency-based auction house will not be available, players will still have access to a gold-based auction house. We'll share more details in the future. <br />
<br />
Will there be separate auction houses in each region? Will I be allowed to bid on items from players outside my own region?<br />
Due to various factors, including technology, language, and currency, there will be multiple separate auction houses serving different player communities around the world. We’ll share specific details on how the auction houses will work for each region as we get closer to launch.<br />
<br />
If I live in Australia/New Zealand/Southeast Asia, what server will I play Diablo III on?<br />
As with StarCraft II, players who purchase the Australia/New Zealand/Southeast Asia version of Diablo III will have their own regional servers, offering lower latency and more action during peak hours. While we encourage players to play on these servers, we recognize that many have longstanding friendships with North American players and would like to continue playing with them. Because of this, we're again giving Australia/New Zealand/ Southeast Asia gamers access to both regions' servers so they can choose where they'd prefer to play.<br />
<br />
How does this impact the items I have purchased in the auction house?<br />
Auction house purchases are bound to the servers in the region in which they're bought. Any items acquired on the Australia/New Zealand/Southeast Asia servers, in-game or otherwise, are bound to those servers and are not transferrable to the North American servers (and vice versa). Please keep this in mind when making purchases in the auction house.<br />
<br />
What currencies will be available? What currency will items in the auction house be viewed in? Can players purchase items using local credit cards or bank accounts?<br />
Our goal is to make the auction house experience in each region as seamless as possible for players, and we are currently exploring various currency and payment options to help achieve that goal. We’ll provide further details as we get closer to launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
AUCTION HOUSE GAMEPLAY ISSUES<br />
<br />
Will I be able to use third-party mods to track auction prices?<br />
For a variety of gameplay and security reasons, we will not be supporting bots or mods in Diablo III, and they’ll be expressly prohibited by our terms of use for the game.<br />
<br />
Can Hardcore-mode characters use the currency-based auction house?<br />
No. Hardcore characters will only have the option to buy and sell items together with other Hardcore characters via a separate &quot;Hardcore-only&quot; gold-based auction house; they will not be able to use the currency-based auction house. Hardcore mode is designed as an optional experience for players who enjoy the sense of constant peril that comes with the possibility of permanent death for a character. All of a Hardcore character’s items are forever lost upon that character’s death, so to avoid the risk of a player spending real money on items that could then be permanently lost when the character dies, we decided restrict the use of the currency-based auction house in Hardcore mode. <br />
<br />
If my character dies in Hardcore mode, will I lose the items that I purchased in the &quot;Hardcore-only&quot; gold-based auction house for that character?<br />
Yes. Again, Hardcore-mode characters will only have access to a &quot;Hardcore-only&quot; gold-based auction house, not the currency-based auction house, and will not be able to trade with non-Hardcore characters. Hardcore is an optional mode designed for players who enjoy playing with the risk of permanently losing their character if the character dies, and that includes the items they acquired with that character. <br />
<br />
Can I just buy the most powerful items and breeze through the game?<br />
Items will be level-restricted, meaning your character won't be able to use an item until he or she is at the appropriate level for that item.<br />
<br />
<br />
AUCTION HOUSE CUSTOMER SUPPORT<br />
<br />
What happens if a player does not receive a purchased item?<br />
The auction process is automated, but if a player purchases an item and for some reason does not receive it, he or she will be able to contact our customer service team to look into the issue.<br />
<br />
What happens if there is a patch and the item I purchased is altered?<br />
It's important for us to ensure that Diablo III remains balanced and fun for years after launch. To that end, it may be necessary to change stats or alter abilities of items from time to time. It’s very important to note that Blizzard will not be providing refunds or making other accommodations if a purchased item is later altered in a patch. Given this, it's up to players to determine whether they're comfortable purchasing items in the currency-based auction house.<br />
<br />
Someone bought an item on my account without my permission. Can I get a refund? <br />
Please note that account sharing will be forbidden in Diablo III's Terms of Use. In cases of compromise, our customer service team will look into the situation and determine the appropriate course of action.<br />
<br />
I accidentally lost or dropped an item I just purchased -- can I get a refund?<br />
No. After a purchase is made, players will be responsible for what they do with the item.<br />
<br />
How will you address bots or cheaters?<br />
We take cheating very seriously, and we've designed Diablo III and Battle.net to include measures to detect and prevent unfair play. In addition, we will have anti-cheating policies in place and will take action to address any issues as they arise.</div></div><hr />

Will be interested to see how this plays out. You know a lot of people will be playing the auction house to make a good income. Would make the auction house much more balanced then the one on WoW because people would be putting real money at stake.</div></div><hr />

As it stands, you have to pay to have it moved to your Visa/MC/Paypal/whatever-else-supported, plus you have to ensure you request that proceeds go to your third-party account of choice, and not to your Battle.net account. AND you have to pay into it (posting and selling fees). Once on the B.net account, you CAN'T take them off.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;pro&quot; players... Hardcore characters can't use it, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a separate Ladder-only one (or Ladder may be excluded too during the season) for that. Besides, it's not like there hasn't been third-party Diablo 2 &quot;auction&quot; sites that sell items for real-world money. This is just a safer means and more reliable, and hell, it means ANYONE can make a buck off of it. You could fund your WoW subscription off of D3 AH work :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
This pretty much.<br />
<br />
Trading items for money was a large part of Diablo 2 and people are still buying D2 items for real money at the moment im typing this. Blizzard knows that they really cant do much to stop this from happening, So why not take advantage of it? The player gets a safer environment to spend their real money on in game items that were obtained by other players and not posted by blizzard, and Blizzard gets a portion of the cash from each of these transactions. <br />
<br />
I see no problem with this, trading RL money for items was going to happen in Diablo 3 anyways, you would have to be a fool to think otherwise. So whats the harm in Blizzard making it easier and safer for you to do so?<br />
<br />
And to the people saying &quot;Pay to Win&quot;. Since Gold is able to be sold as well, whats stopping you from selling your gold to pay for an item with the money you just made from selling the gold? This is no different than paying a large amount of WoW gold for an item on the auction house, its just theres a few extra steps involved.</div></div><hr />

Because it wasnt made easy that way. Now they just say hey you want to be OP just spend RL money and get items others will never get with in-game gold. And this will wreck the game balance.<br />
<br />
What we will get now is what happens in all games that are free and ppl can spend money to get better items.<br />
The ppl who spend ammounts of RL money will be OP in the game and the ones that dont have that cash will always stay behind<br />

You do realize people will STILL sell items even if this is in, right? Unless you make EVERYTHING soulbound the second you touch it, people will sell items.

It will all be monitored by Blizz in game now so there is no shady site that you can possibly be scammed from now. Also the gold sellers won't have a field day with this. With everyone being able to do this legitametly then there won't be as much of a profit from it. <br />
<br />
Also people worried about Blizzard selling things in the Auction house, who cares? If they do end up doing it then I believe it will just be vanity items that you could buy at the blizz store anyway. I highly doubt you will be able to buy weapons and such from Blizz directly. The feature appears more to be a way to limit goldsellers and get Blizz more money. I say yes to both especially when I can make money as well.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who complained then and not now is a hypocrite.While the singular instance isn't particularly bad in its own rite, it leads down a bad road, especially for B2P games. Its the government saying since we know you guys are selling crack and will do it behind our back regardless, we are going to let you do it on state property. The government sees how much the pushers make and start cashing house fees. The government then kicks out all of the pushers and sell their own crack. To further increase profits, the government builds crackhouses on sight, engineer their crack to be more addicting but with less high, they also stop purposely limit other programs to promote their crack sales. (no conspiracy theories).They test the waters with D3 because they know they can get away with it, Activision steps in on their side of the fences with COD:Elite and sell quick access to guns, Blizzard turns around and starts selling raid gear (which has already been depreciated). Just saying, as a shareholder I would run with this idea, they don't care about gaming, just profit i.e. Bobby Kotick.</div></div><hr />

You are so wrong it is not even funny. Buying gold in wow is illegal, which differs from this being completely legal by blizzard.

You realize what game youre talking about right? This is Diablo, not WoW or some other game with actual end game content.<br />
<br />
Most of what Diablo 2 is right now revolves around the economy. Just because somebody wants to pay 300$ to deck out their character doesnt mean that they have a massive advantage.<br />
<br />
A character in a couple shitty golds and a few uniques can farm almost as efficiently as a fully decked out character, the runs just take another minute or 2.<br />
<br />
The only thing that this could really effect is PvP.</div></div><hr />

To all the people over the past few months who swore Blizzard would not implement any type of real-money system for gear - HA. To those who swore they would quit if they saw Blizzard do such a thing - time to put your money where your mouth is, pun intended. Personally, I'm not the slightest bit surprised, nor will any of the people who claim to be outraged over such things be enough of a force to change Blizzard's plans for this. Let's start the clock for WHEN, not IF, this makes it to WoW. I say within 12 months or less, just in time for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

I like this I was not going to buy D3 cause I didn't want to support Activision but now a hardcore gamer like me can make some change by selling of all the rare shit I get, I'll be more than happy with crappy loot and making some good money every month off of playing a video game, hell yeah, about time.

Why waste money trying to hopelessly combat something you have arbitrarily decided is illegal when you could legalize it and make money off of it instead? (There are some very obvious real-world parallels to this)<br />

Diablo is not WoW.<br />
You were able to buy things with real money in Diablo 2 from sites that weren't owned by Blizzard.<br />

that said....i stand by my point....the only people who i feel are going to shell out tons of money to get amazing gear are probably more hardcore than your average gamer anyway....and these people would already do the same in just illegitimate ways....i know that on several occasions me and my friend would spilt like 40 bucks and buy runes and stones of jordan in diablo 2....we in turn traded those for gear such as the enigma armor and all the other rare shit in the game<br />

this changes nothing...people were bound to buy gear regardless....this isnt WoW<br />

I think it's going to lead to some pretty whacky news stories of people playing the game professionally as their main income or huge increases in the number of Gold Farming &quot;sweatshops&quot;. But Diablo being the type of game it is, I doubt it will have too much effect on those playing it. I *do* have a slight issue with the fee structure that Blizz is introducing. &quot;Right, we're going to charge to to list it. Then we're going to charge you again if someone buys it then....wait for it....we're going to charge you a *third* time if you want to spend your money on anything other than us!&quot;. Just seems a wierd set of fees, especially that last one. If you've already paid Blizz for the game, paid them to sell something, paid them to let someone buy it and have that money, it seems a little unfair to then charge you yet again to effectively give you that money. *shrug* maybe that's standard for these types of systems though. However. HOWEVER...HOWEVER. I've really genuinely never said this before, and generally laugh at people who do it in a big dramatic gesture kind of way. But I figure everyone's allowed one time, right? I would quit WoW, no question, if it was introduced there. Pretty much as soon as a &quot;Based on the great success of the real-money AH on Diablo 3, we here at World of Warcraft have decided to....&quot; post went up on the forums my sub would be cancelled. Mainly because I just don't believe Blizzard has the capacity, or even the willing, to fight against the amount of gold farmers this would spawn in WoW - especially since it effectively allows Blizzard to make profits from people farming. And unlike Diablo, that amount of farming would seriously impact the game world for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's intended to kill item shop sites like the ones prevalent in Diablo 2. It could also be interesting to actually earn money playing the game.<br />

I am unsure how this will work completely but it does seem interesting. Will sponsored players have items paid for by the sponsors??? What happens when there is an expansion that causes that gear you paid money for to become wasted? My final thought is how can I take advantage of this system to make profit. This greatly increases the value of bots and 2nd accounts under different user details. I have not used a bot in any game so far, but with a system like this where I might make an profit on one or 2 alt accounts or full parties of bots going I would consider it. Real world money to be earned = no longer a game but potential career. I understand that it may not be easy to setup a one man operation to actually be lucrative in something like this but someone will figure it out. All in all I guess it doesn't hurt me in any way so if this is how blizzard decides to make their game then its their choice!</div></div><hr />

If they were only about stopping farmers, they would make no profit. But they do. And I cannot see past that point.<br />

No it doesn't.<br />

PvP is Diablo II is already a crapshoot because you have to thoroughly PvE your ass off in hopes of getting all the random-drop gear you need/wand to be competative.<br />
<br />
PvP in Diablo III, in a competative arena bubble, has to be controlled anyways with pre-geared characters whose gear cannot be altered beyond certain pre-set available gear. Otherwise it falls massively victim to the random-drop PvE loot system that is the essence of the Diablo franchise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Selling a Spectral Tiger for 500k wouldn't yield an in game advantage? I'm starting to think people missed my point about TCG loot. The point of the matter is, you can easily drop 600 bucks on a Spectral Tiger and sell both versions for about 700k in game gold. That much money can easily buy you anything from BG ratings to GDKP. <br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard will just slap a BoP on everything anyways. Because you know, being forced to disenchant nearly everything you pickup is awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a cash shop, it's an auction house. How could this affect PVP balance if you can find the items/buy them with gold regardless????<br />
<br />
There is no pay2win, the price is completely determined by the willingness of the community to pay for X item. Which, by the way, it ALREADY WAS via ebay in diablo 2.<br />

Once you stop being 17 years old and get a job, this becomes far less of a big deal. Trust me, you will still be able to play this game for 15 hours a day and have the best gear. For those of us in the real world though, our time (which would have been spent farming) is worth far more than $2 for Uber Axe of Pwnage.<br />
<br />
Diablo is free entertainment. No subscription (I love how some idiots in this thread thought there was a subscription). This doesn't affect kids who play games all day for free.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand how you can so blindly assume it will be implemented into WoW. I mean if you were right why wouldn't they have done it already, when they obviously have the capability to do so?

I really hope they will crack down on bots better than in wow, being as half the time on my server I can see the AH flooded with X rare item by a player with the name djahfafg for instance... in this new auction house the sellers name and identity will be protected.

What I could forsee is the in game gold AH being neglected for decent or awesome items, leaving you either to farm on an insanely low drop chance - or fork out real money, this makes me a bit sad.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shamanberry</div><div class="date">2011-08-01, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's going to be real money for items trading in Diablo no matter what blizzard does (or doesn't) do about it. There's no way they can police it. It's impossible - if they spend thousands of dollars trying to get one site shut down, they just reopen 30 minutes later under a new name, and the process has to start over again. They can try to track who's buying items... but let's just say I know people that have been buying LARGE amounts of gold in WoW for 6 years without so much as a warning. If they go after the sellers' accounts, they run into the same problem since they can just switch IP addresses and restart with a new account 5 minutes later. Instead of allowing that to happen on third party sites where players feel they have to go to be competitive with others doing the same thing, they now go through the game itself. It's secure, no risk of identity theft or scamming, no needing to go to sites that are potentially malicious in search of a &quot;legit&quot; one to buy the item you want. Blizzard essentially just put gold/item selling websites out of business. I'll grant that this isn't a good move for competitive play, and if Blizzard wants the competitive portion of the game (ie, Arenas) to have any &quot;e-sport&quot; appeal, they will, of course, have to make items used there be earned through other methods (&quot;arena points&quot; of some description earned directly through playing arenas). But it should be stressed that that was going to be true no matter if they controlled the real-money market or let third party sites do it -- this announcement, regardless of what else you think about it, has zero impact on that aspect.</div></div><hr />

WoW: Get a BoE item. Sell BoE item for gold. Gold has a real world cash equivalence. If item = BoP, deck character out with other BoPs, sell account for real world cash.<br />
<br />
Diablo III. Skip all that nonsense. Sell in-game for real world cash.<br />
<br />
<br />
Difference? The Diablo III way is a smart implementation of the WoW way, and the WoW way cannot be stopped other than to implement this new Diablo III way. Adding this feature to WoW would be a win from every angle.</div></div><hr />

Sure, it's &quot;Pay to (sortof) Win,&quot; but it's not like you can't obtain ANYTHING from the AH from other sources already. Unlike other Micro-transaction based games. If you don't like the feature, don't use it. It's that simple...</div></div><hr />

I'm not worried about ingame economics. This is guaranteed to spawn business that will be based on making money off such auctions. I wouldn't be surprised if the game would be eventually ruined by people who think you might be getting into their business by simply posting auctions - and &quot;paying&quot; you back.</div></div><hr />

I mean if you were right why wouldn't they have done it already, when they obviously have the capability to do so?

<br />
Yes, just because the same company made both games, and has gone from balking at micro-transactions, to embracing them, couldn't possibly be thinking of putting a system that is going to be a literal gold-mine into the world's most profitable MMORPG. Don't get it twisted - I WANT to be wrong about this, completely, blissfully wrong. Yet since neither of us can see the future, all we can do is speculate, which is what I'm doing. You cannot say they won't with any more certainty that I believe they will, even though the groundwork has been laid.</div></div><hr />

I love games, but have very little time to put in it. That's why i quit WoW, casual had no real rewards (achievements and welfare epics). Now i'll just buy stuff and I'll shine like Kungen in the middle of Orgrimmar.<br />

Who cares? The only point of the economy is to get these items anyways correct? You can completely avoid the economy of the game and completely get by as though it doesn't exist at all.</div></div><hr />

Really you guys? How many people do that in WoW and D2 back in its prime buying runes buying full characters with money. Sure this may have been under the radar and illegal, but now it's time for Blizzard to rake in some money that gold farmers are making ie: taking a percentage of the buyout. This change if you read the article says we can use both gold and real life money and I don't see it being a ig deal it changes nothing except putting those sites that sell gold and items to no use anymore.<br />

Edit: My only personal problem is if they don't fix duping, someone will make tons off that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By all means speculate, but a company putting out one game that does one thing and another game that's completely different and doing something controversial like this is no indication at all that they would do it in the initial game released. Especially if they haven't done it already when that system practically already exists in the game. And especially when it effects both games so differently.<br />

<br />
You have no proof they're making a profit, however. They very well could be only making enough to pay for the system's transactions.</div></div><hr />
