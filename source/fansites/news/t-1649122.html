<br />
I kinda wanted it when I saw it spinning in circles and how much dirt and smoke it kicked up...<br />
<br />
But then it jumped. And that gigantic tread-thing in the front bounced and tilted at a weird angle, and as it came down the blades in the back flopped out. It really makes this already kinda silly looking mount (still looks like an insect to me), look like it's poorly made. It's so long-looking too. :(<br />
<br />
It's too bad that Paul Jr's crew had so little to work with. The Blizzard team that showed up was so excited to show off the horde, but the alliance stuff was all about Knights in Shining Armor. <br />
<br />
And yet. Paul Jr's crew couldn't even get that right. It still looks like an insectoid snow-mobile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at the gold market, it sells for ~$1.50 per 1,000 gold, placing the approximate value of the chopper at $150. The cash shop would've been cheaper. Even if you farmed gold and sold it for real $, the opportunity cost is still higher unless it was sold by Blizzard for over $150. <br />

<br />
The Bad : That Alliance mount price. 100k is absolutely ludicrous. No mount in the game should ever cost that much, barring player<br />
prices via AH or an extremely rare item in the BMAH. I can understand the other side having to buy the mount since it lost, which is<br />
fair enough, but a price that steep? A big and hearty &quot;Fuck you&quot;, a thousand times over, to whomever okayed that decision. At least<br />
10k upwards to 50k would've been a VERY acceptable price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know that it's shock at the price so much as being amazed that actually made it in. Most people I talked to just thought it was an over-inflated beta ha-ha funny price.<br />

Haha yeah was nice of them to do that for the Horde! And I remember when the Alliance were QQing because the Goblins all got new models for a racial mount and Alliance didn't have anything. So then they added some more horse models but even more plain and boring than any others in the game because FUCK the Alliance.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Competition&quot; was just a popularity contest the Horde was always going to win. It was NEVER about the bikes.<br />
<br />
This bike doesn't have any extra utility, it can't even fly. Even players with hundreds of thousands of gold spare to throw around will have a very hard time justifying the spend, especially when there are so many great mounts with WoD. It's ONLY for people who really want an Alliance themed bike like the horde got for free. I feel the 100k is more of a punishment to the Alliance than anything else.</div></div><hr />

And note, that the only Horde players who got their bike for free, are those who logged on prior to Sept 30th. Anyone after that date got no mount. And as of yet, there is no way to acquire it otherwise, either.<br />
Model looks good/bad? Subjective (though clearly, the Horde bike was more favoured in terms of design, based on the voting of the contest).<br />
Do you need it to get something of player power in the game? Nope.<br />
Does it cost real money? Not in the least.<br />
Thereby, it is a luxury, vanity item. It certainly is pricy as hell, but everything to do with it, is in the right place.<br />
Not like we needed another vendor-loaded mount for this expansion. Already got that covered for 130,000 gold for the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth + Grand Expedition Yak. And given that the Yak is just repairs + transmog now (since reforge was removed), and costs 20,000 MORE... shouldn't the outrage be there?</div></div><hr />

How is it Horde favoritism? Was it not a contest? Did Alliance win? No they did not. Alliance is lucky to be able to have the bike in game when they lost the contest.

Where did it say that? IIRC, it was said that the winning bike would be available for free to its respective faction. I'm pretty sure it was never stated that the other bike wouldn't be available at all. Please correct me if I'm wrong, a link would be nice.<br />
<br />
Also, this mentality that the Horde player base somehow actively won something and the Alliance player base somehow actively lost something is absurd. Neither group of players had any input in the design of the bikes whatsoever. No players from either faction put any actual work into either mount. All the players did was click a button to indicate which one of two finished products they thought looked better. I know of several Alliance players that voted for the tricycle because they thought it looked better. Did they lose?</div></div><hr />

IIRC Blizzard designed and built the bikes, all we did was vote on which was best. So yeah, it's entirely Blizzard's fault.<br />
The stupid Azeroth Choppers thing was Blizzard's idea that no one wanted to begin with and all we did for it was judge their crappy bikes and because the Alliance one wasn't as good, it lost the vote and we are forced to suffer.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I love how some of you don't understand that the mount costs so much because it lost the competition and wasn't even going to be added in the first place.<br />
A competition would've involved us competing in some way, we didn't, we simply judged Blizzard and the Chopper guys work. Also Blizzard never once said the Alliance bike would not be added, Only that the winning bike would be added for free (with no mention of the losing one).</div></div><hr />

100,000 gold for the mount that lost a popularity contest because it was poorly designed, yeah that makes sense.<br />

This is too logical. I don't like it on these forums! BEGONE!<br />

But seriously, I didn't even think of it that way. I did just reach 100k again today though...but I'd rather save up for a cool TCG mount or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there was a TV series Azeroth Choppers. Alliance and Horde bikes were built on it and players had to vote which they like best, winner got the bike in game, alliance was added later at a gold fee while winners Horde got theirs for free</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that would've been a player competition. The competition wasn't between the players, it was between the choppers. They were competing for votes and the players were the voters. That's still a competition.<br />
<br />
Also, you might've missed it, but here's a quote from an official Blizzard article:<br />
<br />
<br />
Due to popular demand (and a few shady back-alley deals in Stormwind’s Old Town), the Alliance bike built for Azeroth Choppers will be rumbling its way to a vendor in Azeroth sometime after the launch of Warlords of Draenor<br />
<br />
The key line is, &quot;Due to popular demand.&quot; This implies that they had no intention of adding it to the game.<br />
<br />
Here's another quote, <br />
The votes have been cast and the results are tallied. In the final episode of Azeroth Choppers, the teams come together at Blizzard HQ to find out which bike is destined for digital glory. This one, again, implies that only one of the two Choppers is going to be added in-game (&quot;find out which bike is destined for digital glory.&quot;).<br />
<br />
One final quote, <br />
Your votes for Azeroth Choppers were counted, and one faction’s war cry roared loudest: the Horde bike will now be turned into a mount in World of Warcraft! Again, this is a very solid and unmistakable implication that only one mount is being added in-game. So, yes, my original posting was 100% correct.<br />

Oh I'm pretty sure it was always a big tease. If you go back and read it carefully the original contest said the winner would get a &quot;FREE mount&quot;. Leaving it ambiguous whether the loser would get a non-free mount. They did leave us hanging for a while there though...<br />

<br />
I did. But since more hardcore WoW fans are majority Horde (I'd say about 60-65%), they'll win every vote Blizzard ever has on a thing like this. So we're basically boned, even though we're the majority faction in the actual game.<br />
<br />
I don't really care, but I do think 100K is excessive considering Horde got theirs for free. No one has that kind of money lying around unless they actually enjoy playing the AH. I've hovered between 5-15K for years. Make enough money to afford raiding and convenience. The only time I purposefully farmed gold was to get Shadow's Edge.<br />
<br />
EDIT: People who think the vote was over the quality of the bikes themselves are laughably naive. It's always a popularity contest between factions, especially when the winning faction gets a prize.</div></div><hr />

In terms of overall population, Alliance still leads by a fair margin. I guess it's easier to blame it on the rest of the Alliance players &quot;not being hardcore enough&quot;, rather than the core issue, which is the Alliance chopper being simply terrible all along. I know many Alliance players that voted for the Horde one (the &quot;least bad&quot; of the two) for this very reason.<br />
<br />
Besides, at the time of voting, it wasn't known that the winning chopper would be gifted to all members of that faction - but merely, that the winner would become an in-game mount. And at that point, I think most of us suspected that it'd be a store mount. It was later on that they announced that both choppers would make it into the game, and that Horde would get theirs for free.</div></div><hr />

That is his point. You can't even make gold these days because everyone got herbs, everyone got ore, everyone got enchanting mats and tip 5g for an enchant. So, in reality, yes everyone will keep using bots and gold sellers to buy stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not insult to injury, it's the price it has to pay for being the loser. This bike was largely requested by fans, but giving it such a cheap price like 1k is almost as free as the winner was, which would undermine the whole event. It makes sense the bike is so costly, and i think it doesn't look half bad. Actually, infact, I think it's pretty nice looking. Maybe better than Horde.</div></div><hr />

You really sincerely believe it wasn't being made alongside the Horde bike from the beginning? Give me a break. It was never going to be one or the other. Believe whatever you want. Doesn't make it true. They didn't wait until the poll was finished before they started the first bike. You'll never convince me of that. Ever. Because it didn't happen. And we were always going to get both in one form or another.<br />
<br />
Oh, but I guess now that it's in-game, the price is inconsequential just because it exists, right? What if it were 200k? 300k? 400k? 1 million golds? Would you still be in here defending it, going &quot;guiz plz stop whining&quot;? Doubt it. Even you have a price point in your head where it would become absurd whether you know it or not. Or maybe you're a Horde player and you really couldn't care less, so it's easy to argue over something that you're not affected by.<br />
<br />
And to a lot of people, it's far, far too expensive. That's bout it.</div></div><hr />

Bike is UGLY and not that exclusive (already saw 10 of them on my server). And yes, it is an insult to &quot;offer&quot; for an ugly single seat, ground and without any extras mount (that shouldn´t even be on WoW, since it is ugly as hell).<br />
<br />
Not to mention this is the third time of Horde Flavour by Blizzard:<br />
1) the Raptor to counter the Frostsaber<br />
2) The goblin trikes (worgen mounts = 2 random horses, as if the alliance doesn´t already has a lot of horses)<br />
3) the Azeroth Chopper (ok, both mounts look ugly, but 100k is an insult).<br />
<br />
This mount cost should have been 99999 iron scraps and with a double warning before buying (&quot;Are you really really sure you want this double plated slug mount?&quot;)</div></div><hr />

Since it's the one that lost why make it unique by making it hard to get?</div></div><hr />
