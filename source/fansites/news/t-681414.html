World 3rd Tribute to Immortality in Korea<br />
Tribute to Immortality (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4079/a-tribute-to-immortality/) first kills are fun, each new kill happens on a new continent. This time a Korean coalition of multiple guilds known as &quot;Team Force&quot; completed the achievement on November 30th according to this post (http://www.playforum.net/wow/board.comm?action=read&amp;iid=10158002&amp;pageNo=1&amp;num=21156#)! Congratulations to them. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Why you won't get a release date for 3.3<br />
We've explained many times over why we don't provide release dates for patches. Yes, we have a target date for the patch, however there are still numerous obstacles that could push back that target date by multiple weeks. We understand that publicly releasing a date and then pushing it back would lead to a far worse outcry on the forums than we see when simply letting players speculate about when the patch will be released. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21376271669-what-will-you-do-first-when-33-hits-tomorrow.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Are Death Knights unpopular?<br />
They aren't. If you mean they are less popular than warriors as main tanks, that's true. But that is also the case for druids and paladins, whom some of you claim are self-evidently overpowered.<br />
<br />
But DKs are very popular in cutting edge guilds for dps and quite popular as off tanks. This is hand waving, and I don't have any concrete numbers to back this up, but my suspicion is that DKs are either the most popular off tank or else are number two after warriors. Warrior + DK is a very popular tank setup for many guilds capable of clearing heroic raid content.<br />
<br />
One conclusion that I think you can draw from looking at what classes and specs the very good guilds bring is that there is a lot of variation, and certainly much more than in BC. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21333888680-are-dk-tanks-going-to-get-a-buff-soon.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-rogue/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br />
Subtlety Tree<br />
That's a good assessment. Ultimately, we'd like for more talent trees to look like Subtlety. Trading utility A for utility B is an interesting decision. Trading utility A for more dps is not an interesting decision; the latter is always going to win.<br />
<br />
Somewhat related, for the pure dps classes it's likely that there will always be a spec with the theoretically highest dps. It's going to be nigh impossible to make multiple talent trees provide identical dps regardless of gear improvement, encounter specifics or group synergies. Our goal instead is just to get things close enough that players are willing to sacrifice a little bit of dps for a playstyle they really enjoy. (For some players, losing any dps is unacceptable, but I also know enough hardcore players that I can say with some confidence that you can't just make a blanket statement that all competitive players feel this way.)<br />
<br />
I don't think we're there with rogues yet. Assassination is now a serious contender in end-game raiding, but Subtlety isn't and hasn't been since HAT was in a silly place. I think we're a lot closer with mages. Arcane may be the highest dps in a general sense, but there are fights on which Fire will win. Frost is a lot closer than it used to be, to the point where someone who just loves Frost won't feel like they are horribly gimping their group's progress. (It probably still needs to be slightly higher than where it is, but we'll see what Icecrown is like.) We eventually want to get rogues, locks and hunters closer to where mages appear to be in 3.3 (and work on mages more too of course).<br />
<br />
Honor Among Thieves was a good attempt to get more combo points, and therefore damage, into the tree. It ended up having the scaling problem that a lot of our abilites have -- it's easy for it to be too weak in a small, 5-player group and to be too powerful when it's scaling off of 25 players. (Restricting it to a group doesn't really help because you can just fill that group full of folks who crit a lot, and raids provide a lot more buffs to guarantee crits.)<br />
<br />
I do agree with the general feel of Subtlety being high finisher damage and cps through alternative routes, and that's a kit we want to keep going forward. I also agree that Ghostly Strike, Hemo and Backstab all could use more &quot;juice&quot; (by which I don't just mean higher dps). I'll also add that I think we went a little overboard in emphasizing damage over utility in Lich King PvE, especially in the earlier raid tiers. Who needs a good Sap when you're AE'ing everything down?<br />
<br />
PvP-wise, utility can be a lot more useful than in PvE. However, as I've said before we think we've kind of let rogues get into too much of that glass cannon state. They either keep someone controlled and blow them up, or they themselves get blown up. We would still like to tone down some of the rogue CC and increase some of their passive (not cooldown-based) survivability. It's a little weird that leather classes are generally more fragile than cloth.<br />
<br />
We try very hard not to give due dates on some of these changes. When you read through threads like this, I think you can see why. The risk of sharing some of our long-term plans is players then get frustrated when the changes don't materialize in the next patch. We have a very long list of changes we'd like to make to WoW, and if we tried to get them all into whatever the next patch is going to be, those patches would just get continually delayed. When I say &quot;long term&quot; I'm trying to say not to look for a change any time soon (because we haven't made the change yet) but that we recognize the problem and have some ideas we'd like to try out. This philosophy is the whole genesis of the infamous &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;When it's ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words, it isn't that we don't care -- just that we have a lot to do. If you buy that, then all you can really argue with is our prioritization for what we do first and I totally acknowledge there are subjective elements to that as well as considerations that aren't necessarily transparent to the community. I have no doubt that you might prioritize things differently were you in our shoes.<br />
<br />
I know the Blizzard pace of development can be frustrating for some people, but when you look back at the history of the company, it's hard to argue that it doesn't work for us. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21035180052-weekly-sub-tree-questions.html))</div></div><hr />

I think most will agree.. we hope HAT will NEVER make a return either...<br />
It dumbs down rogues to a &quot;1&quot; button class, rather than SS, SnD, Rupture, Evisc. Which, granted, isn't much, but it beats the one button by a long shot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beingpeace</div><div class="date">2009-12-01, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unlike the guild-base raid moods in the US and Euroupe, Korean WoW players prefer having an independant raiding team or pug for playing PvE contents. Therefore, Most of PuGs are running under quite serious character screenings and very, very strict gold bidding rules in order to 'preserve' their well-being runs. This unique mood helps korean servers carry multiple successful PuGs even for A Tribute to Immortality achievement run.<br />
<br />
However, It has some side effects.. First, most players have very intense anticipation among each other so if your character fails once or two in the raid then, you will be fined or blacklisted from major PuG runs. Second, its gold run. You should bring a lot of gold to gear your chacracter up.This is why Korean WoW economy is suffering from servere gold inflation. They need to buy gold from cheap chinese labors when they hit lv 80 or farm their gold for 24/7 just like chinese farmers. Simply if you don't have gold you can't get your gears. Of course, In the opposition, if you bring a lot of gold as shopper, will treated well even if you don't know any strat :).<br />

My guess he's one of the add tanks and in a untouchable set. Grabs adds blows trinkets and Shield block and doesn't take dmg at all. Just my guess.<br />

He was pobably offtank, which means he has to get shield block value, and getting shield block value items equals wearing ulduar or even lower gear, that's most likely the reason for his health</div></div><hr />

Are Death Knights unpopular?<br />
They aren't. If you mean they are less popular than warriors as main tanks, that's true. But that is also the case for druids and paladins, whom some of you claim are self-evidently overpowered.<br />
<br />
where u get this statement from? on my server paladins are just as good as warriors at maintanking, if not better<br />

I can understand that Blizz want to &quot;change&quot; things, and are &quot;aware&quot; about problems ...<br />
but is already 1 year after WotLK release, and we still don't have decent class balance in pvp.<br />
<br />
WotLK changed allot the way we were used to play rogue class.<br />
don't know what others believe but I never asked for those changes.<br />
<br />
I will give a very small example:<br />
Brutal Gladiator ( BC ) helm Armor value: 475<br />
Deadly Gladiator ( WotLK ) helm Armor: 470<br />
some people might not find relevant this,<br />
but the amount of physical damage in WotLK is much higher than in BC ...<br />
<br />
will not go forward to comment what are now the chances of a<br />
rogue against a skilled mage or skilled druid, dPriest, even some Locks, <br />
in the case rogue doesn't get help, or trinket on cd, or CoS on cd, so on.<br />
<br />
In BC rogue had much higher survivability.<br />
<br />
I enjoy seeing such bp where, &quot;we plan to ...&quot;<br />
I just remind that is already 1 year since LK release, and I personally don't have hope<br />
to see much improvement in pvp the way things are now.<br />

Therefore, Most of PuGs are running under quite serious character screenings and very, very strict gold bidding rules in order to 'preserve' their well-being runs. This unique mood helps korean servers carry multiple successful PuGs even for A Tribute to Immortality achievement run.<br />
<br />
However, It has some side effects.. First, most players have very intense anticipation among each other so if your character fails once or two in the raid then, you will be fined or blacklisted from major PuG runs. Second, its gold run. You should bring a lot of gold to gear your chacracter up.This is why Korean WoW economy is suffering from servere gold inflation. They need to buy gold from cheap chinese labors when they hit lv 80 or farm their gold for 24/7 just like chinese farmers. Simply if you don't have gold you can't get your gears. Of course, In the opposition, if you bring a lot of gold as shopper, will treated well even if you don't know any strat :).<br />
<br />
* trying to fix some typo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to correct some facts here and clarify.<br />
<br />
Yes, in Korea our PUGs are more serious and on a gold bidding system, but that it for casuals like me.<br />
The majority of these PUGs usually kill up to twins in ToGC-25, some exceptionally good PUGs on good servers even kill up to Anub.<br />
Although the problems with the side-affects are true, it is by no means impossible to gear up without gold farming like a chinese farmer. But yes it takes longer and you will need to have some awesome luck if you want to get some of the popular gears. (ex: death verdict)<br />
<br />
But hardcores, gather in teams or coalition as Boub put it. Although members for these teams come from various guilds they are not really PUGs. These teams use the same DKP system as raiding guilds and alot of them have trail sessions as well.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is we view guilds for strictly community purposes. Some guilds are begining to try out a guild raiding system and the first Tribute to Insanity in our region was actually done by a raiding guild. But guild raiding is still somthing thats usually frowned upon.<br />
<br />
So no, in essence the Tribute to Immortality was not PUG'd because Team Force is not a PUG. Think of it as a raiding guild Team Force with members from various community groups.</div></div><hr />

he was complaining about _getting_ 2 shotted, after he - as a rogue - used his cds and has no heal. i play my restoration shaman in arenas and i know what &quot;no passive survivability&quot; means. ok, rogues can pop cooldowns, but you can force them to use those directly in the beginning of a match.<br />
for example against a good warrior its like 1st bladestorm: all melee cds used, 2nd bladestorm: dead.</div></div><hr />

also, I'm glad there is some attention being given to the Subtlety tree, even if no changes will be made for awhile. Subtlety was always the most fun imo, but it just became useless in PvE and a severe downgrade from Assa in PvP (though some will always argue otherwise). Here's to hoping they can at least make it a viable option again :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but you will need Naxx25/Uld10/HToC5 gear to beat the new heroics. They're adding a 5-man progression chain to match (and trail) 10/25 raiding progression. Frozen Halls Heroics drop 232 loot, but you have to have HToC (or Uld10) on farm to be able to beat them, just like ICC25 drops 264 loot, but you're not getting far if you don't have ToC25 reduced to speed runs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">magicism</div><div class="date">2009-12-01, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then please, do tell, what is so horribly wrong with priest right now then?<br />
<br />
The fact that all other healing classes are easy mode and holy priests still have to actually play their class. Druids have rejuv spam, Shaman change target and cast Chain Heal every GC and any good paladin has every number on his keyboard bound to Holy Light and just needs to remember to keep rolling face. Obviously, all the healing classes are harder than say DPS (tanks are different) and alot of our performance takes place outside the fight itself in optimisation, gearing etc but once you have it all down it is mostly the same thing fight to fight with a couple of different numbers.<br />
<br />
I am not complaining about any of these classes anyway, my message just used priests as an example. There are almost no changes to any healing classes and our optimisation doesn't change at all. It is just boring. These classes that get balanced constantly, there is nothing wrong with them, it is just easier to alter dps as it doesn't make most fights easier or harder it just makes them take less time. It is one of the reasons they don't change tanks as much as they do dps classes. But it is just boring having nothing change.</div></div><hr />

They aren't. If you mean they are less popular than warriors as main tanks, that's true. But that is also the case for druids and paladins, whom some of you claim are self-evidently overpowered.<br />
<br />
Most people I know, DO dislike DK's and not for tanking reasons. From what I have seen on my server and reading the forums, DK's are generally disliked by those that come up against them while leveling. on Coilfang US, Hellfire has become a gank fest for new DK's and since they are far superior in gear level and dps, at that stage, even a bad player can usually own anyone. I think this is what people really dislike of the DK's. But, I enjoy playing my 76 alt DK.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, once these lowlifes can figure out how to &quot;move toon here, watch for weird spot on the floor there&quot; and &quot;stay away from bosses [Mouth/Legs/Tail] over here&quot; they will clear it, but the learning curve will [hopefully] be steep and shun the bads from trying it with people that know what they are doing</div></div><hr />

...<br />
<br />
Druids are a little more complex than that, while on the surface you can spam rejuv to death and seem to be &quot;successful&quot;, you do absolutely nothing to help the raid succeed (unless you're dealing with a fight such as H IC or H Twins). We're completely dependent on CDs (read all two of them) to do quick healing since our only direct heal is nourish and even as good as nourish is, it's an absolute mana drainer when spammed (don't bring up HT, nourish is cheaper, faster and +25% crit from talents, thereby proc'ing 20% faster casting). Similarly with resto shammy, their days as a one trick pony are long gone. I would speak more upon their behalf but I'm not as experienced with them as I would like.<br />
<br />
If there's one class that shouldn't be complaining about where they stand as a healer, it's a priest.<br />
<br />
Indirect healing? Check - PoM, Renew<br />
Direct healing? Check - Greater Heal, Flash Heal<br />
Instant healing? Check - Desperate Prayer, Surge of Light =&gt; Flash of Light<br />
Damage mitigation? Check - PW:S, Inspiration<br />
AoE healing? Check - Circle of Healing, Holy Nova, Divine Hymn<br />
<br />
Hmm, what else can we do to make priests stronger?<br />
<br />
Well that whole &quot;dieing&quot; thing really sucks, how about we give them an ability that stops their target from dieing? GS, done<br />
What happens if their target is taking damage, but the priest is taking damage too? We can't have that! Binding Heal, done<br />
Crap, people are taking damage and imagine all those GCDs!!! There has to be a better way, what do we have? Lightwell, done<br />
Bubble seems so lackluster and people are having problems with mobility on certain boss mechanics... Body and Soul, done<br />
Priest is down, he can't heal anymore, we need to fix this. But those pesky ankhs and bres's have big CDs! Spirit of Redem, done<br />
<br />
I don't play priest so I'm probably missing something big to strengthen my case, but still, those aren't good enough? Also what I stated is from a single healing tree, need more single target healing/damage mitigation, you can always switch to disc and pick up more abilities. Priests have a tool for every situation and you complain about the lack of changes to your class? I have no clue why.</div></div><hr />

Priests have a tool for every situation and you complain about the lack of changes to your class? I have no clue why.<br />
<br />
Oh joy. Hmm, I am going to start out by quoting what I originally said.<br />
<br />
I am not complaining about any of these classes anyway, my message just used priests as an example. There are almost no changes to any healing classes and our optimisation doesn't change at all. It is just boring.<br />
<br />
Right, now we have that out of the way lets move on to your neat little list shall we?<br />
<br />
Indirect healing? Check - PoM, Renew (You either use Renew or Flash Heal depending on spec and glyph, using both would mean we lock out alot of the other stuff you brag about us having later.)<br />
Direct healing? Check - Greater Heal (Redundant), Flash Heal (See above)<br />
Instant healing? Check - Desperate Prayer (On myself. Yer, thats great.), Surge of Light =&gt; Flash of Light (Roughly 12.5% of the time yeah. Oh and only for 4-5k)<br />
Damage mitigation? Check - PW:S (Not viable in Holy), Inspiration (On crits, hardly controlable, albiet that or ancestral healing should be up 100% of the time on tanks.)<br />
AoE healing? Check - Circle of Healing, Holy Nova (Sick yer, lets not have any mana, that sounds like a good idea.), Divine Hymn (Oh yer, cose you consider tranquility to be an everlasting source of AoE healing right? No, 10 minute cooldown.)<br />
Well that whole &quot;dieing&quot; thing really sucks, how about we give them an ability that stops their target from dieing? GS, done Lasts for 10 seconds, 3 minute cooldown even if it doesn't proc unless glyphed (then 1 minute).<br />
What happens if their target is taking damage, but the priest is taking damage too? We can't have that! Binding Heal, done Large mana cost, similar to the problem you said not to mention with HT just with a better spell.<br />
Crap, people are taking damage and imagine all those GCDs!!! There has to be a better way, what do we have? Lightwell, done No one takes lightwell because DPS are too busy doing rotations to click it and seriously, when should you rely on other people to heal themselves when the blame would fall on you?<br />
Bubble seems so lackluster and people are having problems with mobility on certain boss mechanics... Body and Soul, done As Holy you don't bubble. Especially if there is a disc in the raid as well. They also cost far too much as Holy. Albiet great talent.<br />
Priest is down, he can't heal anymore, we need to fix this. But those pesky ankhs and bres's have big CDs! Spirit of Redem, done YES! 15 seconds of extra healing. Oh thank god. Seriously, I don't know what I would do without this talent, I mean I am so bad I am forever dying and decided to glyph it to get EVEN MORE time after I die to keep healing because I die so gosh darn much.<br />
<br />
As I said before. I will defend priests because I obviously play one and like it very much. I just think there are things that need to be addressed with all the healing classes and my first post was from the view point of every class that has a healing spec. We all have different opinions but confronting me when I was standing up for your class as well is a bit stupid.<br />
<br />
Also shhh, we obviously don't mention Paladins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be more like Koralon 10m or Emalon 25m.<br />
<br />
A.K.A. the pugs will wipe like crazy at the beginning because they have 2 brain cells, but once it gets simplified down to a single strat that even the mouthbreathers can follow (and once said strat percolates through the general consciousness), it will be cleared just as easily as Koralon is now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone who says the word &quot;mouthbreathers&quot; is a tard. Period.<br />
<br />
And for the subject matter, i doubt the 5 man instance will be hard at all for anyone geared with toc, which isn't hard considering most 80s go their in blues anyway..</div></div><hr />

No he did not say that. He said &quot;all other elements being equal (gear, skill, encounter preference, technological interference).&quot; then that is the order DPS should be in.<br />

Obvously those things are not always equal but he was obviously referring to the potential/capability of a particular class to output dps assuming certain constants.<br />

It is nothing to do with &quot;how good you are the game&quot;.<br />

I mostly agree with Rilgon although I would put Rogues with Hunters/Mages/Warlocks. In my expereince those classes are always at the top of the meters.<br />

Wow, you're an idiot.<br />
Have a clue what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
So would this mean you'd stack all druid healers just because they're supposedly more desired?<br />
No.<br />
And how are people getting their opinion, off a healing meter where HoTs are clearly going to triumph the meters just because they're not casted spells, and they easily fill in gaps.<br />
I don't see why people come to the conclusion there is a preferred class to any healer.<br />
Its usually always biased.<br />
Regardless, variety of healers is key to a raid anyways.<br />
1v1 alone to a healer, sure we don't compare<br />
<br />
<br />
But guess what guys, I know this will blow your mind.<br />
<br />
THIS GAME ISNT BALANCED 1v1.<br />
It's balanced around 10 or 25 people raid.<br />
Of all classes, that compliment each other.<br />
Mind blowing ain't it?<br />
<br />
No one should care that a HoT rolling class is supposedly better just because of the massive HPS they can pull.<br />
You should think positively that you each compliment one another.<br />
Not go, &quot;Oh, druid healing looks so OP, Imma re-reroll druid and well just have raid healers as Resto druids and shamans.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's just silly.<br />
<br />
Priests are fine.<br />
Maybe discipline could use abit of a boost, but holy, is fine.<br />
Ive never had so much fun healing till now as a holy priest. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually, having run them on the PTR, the first two aren't HARD, but I think they're harder than MgT was on the PTRs when it was being tested. The last one, however, is quite probably the least PUG friendly instance I've seen. That includes oldschool strat/scholo/UBRS. Granted many of the players on the PTR were premades, which makes their skill questionable, but in a group with 2 known non-premades (that outgeared the premades) and 3 premades of at least slightly above average skill, the 3rd one was still a bit challenging. Granted, it was the first time I ran it, but at the same time, I can't see a lot PUGS having a ton of success in there right of the bat when it's still hard for an average player that outgears it by a significant margin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ON ANOTHER NOTE: With the addition of Frostborn rep to instances, I am wondering if there were rep rewards added in the patch? I was checking each new build for awhile, but didn't find anything. Not sure if it was added late, I missed it, or it's still just another rep for the counter. As someone who got exalted in early May with them.... I want my eagle mount :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your right, usually these arguments revolve around complaining. &quot;I am a lock, why is this Enhance Shammy hanging with me&quot;. But in this case, all things aside, Riglon has it right. In a 100% equal game (which we know this is not), the pure &gt; hybrid rule should apply. And for the most part, I think that order is fairly accurate in the real world.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No he did not say that. He said &quot;all other elements being equal (gear, skill, encounter preference, technological interference).&quot; then that is the order DPS should be in.<br />
<br />
Obvously those things are not always equal but he was obviously referring to the potential/capability of a particular class to output dps assuming certain constants.<br />
<br />
It is nothing to do with &quot;how good you are the game&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mostly agree with Rilgon although I would put Rogues with Hunters/Mages/Warlocks. In my experience those classes are always at the top of the meters.<br />
<br />
The correlation is obviously between how much the classes bring to the raid in terms of buffs and their abillity to output high dps. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He has Rogues up there with Hunters/Mages/Locks...right above them. In Blizzards perfect world, the Rogue &gt; Hunter/Mage/Lock rule applies. In theory it is simply because rogues are the only melee class out of the pures, which makes them slightly (or considerably, depending on the fight) more difficult to play, and therefore top DPS.</div></div><hr />

I only say might because posts that have the the rhetoric of &quot;pure classes &gt; 'Hybrid' classes' are usually just smacks of complaining.It is complaining. However, it's legitimate complaining.<br />
<br />
Why should hybrids, who will be brought ANYWAYS for their buffs (ideal raid build has, at the very least, one Ret Paladin, one Enhancement Shaman, one Elemental Shaman, one Boomkin, one Feral Druid, and possibly one or more Shadow Priests, depending on Replenishment availability), have equal or better DPS to pure classes who neither have that level of utility nor the ability to step into another role to preserve their raid spot? As a Hunter, I bring virtually nothing aside from DPS - I'd take a pretty decent DPS dip to go SV for Replenishment (and other classes do it better, like Shadow Priests and Ret Paladins), Trueshot Aura is overwritten by AM and UR, which usually have near-100% uptime regardless (and provide a benefit to the DK/Shaman using them, which TSA does not), and the meager utility of Silencing Shot comes, again, at a cost to personal DPS as I have to decouple it from my macros to use it as an actual silence.<br />
<br />
A pure DPS class brings DPS. That's it. They HAVE to be better at DPS than hybrids, or why would you ever bring them at all?<br />
<br />
One only needs to look at the first sets of Anub25H kills and the WMO world DPS scoreboards to see that Hunters are languishing behind badly, and there's no good reason why.</div></div><hr />

Same reason people bring more then one Ret paladin, Death Knight, or Hunter to the raid. They know how raid.<br />
<br />
Numbers only assist people getting from A to B, they don't do it themselves. Many people are more then happy to overlook that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That hinges on a number of things. What gear said person can get for their main spec (or off spec, if no one else in the raid is likely to get or use said piece of gear) from the boss(s) attempted would one of the few key ones in my opinion. For progression it'd really be a toss up, since both are similar. If you want to bring numbers into this, considering every probability/improbability that those certain bosses can bring/do, it'd matter on how the individual players can perform when those arise, since a Boomkin can't Tranq. shot, and a Hunter can't provide support for our casters.<br />
<br />
And the people have to want raid to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's debatable. There's a classic RPG argument that the lightest armor + lowest hp (cloth) should be the top DPS because they can take the least amount of hits. But you're right, being in the thick of combat when there are whirlwinds and splash damage makes it tough to be a melee. IMO, Rogues should have slightly higher single-target DPS, but Mages should have slightly higher AOE dps. It makes sense that a class that can rain down fire and ice would be able to do more damage to a wider area. Warlocks should have a happy medium between the two. But the game isn't balanced around what makes sense in a realistic way or even a fantasy way. The game is balanced around player complaints over the ability to get groups--especially in 5-man situations. Everyone feels entitled to a group slot and Blizzard has done their best to ensure this happens. This includes giving pretty much everyone AOE dps of some sort. <br />
<br />
I like imbalance. It gives the game flavor and you have to make a decision as a player to make a tradeoff. Picking a certain class should have benefits and drawbacks. The benefits give you a reason to play your class, and the drawbacks give you a reason to choose another complementary class in your group to fill that void. I really don't like that Blizzard has homogenized all of the DPS classes. But it's a decision they've gone and made a long while ago, so there's really no point in me sitting here and whining about it. I just hope future MMO developers don't follow this boring trend.</div></div><hr />

Then it'd still be a toss up. I'm not sure I want my success to hinge on upon a 20 (soon to be 10 :V) minute cooldown and a bunch of toys that, as you've said &quot;May already be present&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Its Tribute of Immortality were talking about here (dont let anyone die in a full raid lockout @ hardmodes). What you are talking about is Tribute of Insanity which is done by more than 330 guilds allready.</div></div><hr />

Last note, because this might be getting old to alot of people on MMO-Champion.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not dodging the question, I'm simply answering, even if it's an answer you may not like. AS I've said time and time again, buffs are one out of many reasons to bring someone, and letting that be a deciding factor when there are other, more important reasons to bring someone as DPS is a practice that isn't good in practice.<br />
<br />
And this is far off from what started the conversation to begin with, being a dispute about whether or not &quot;Pure&quot; classes should have higher DPS over &quot;Hybrids&quot; because they're (paraphrasing) &quot;they're not good at anything else,&quot; followed by people agreeing and then bringing up the other problem with this mentality, being that those saying don't really have a general direction of what the 'DPS hierarchy' should be other then &quot;my class&quot;, why I hate. (Another factually bankrupting, credibility destroying quote right there).<br />
<br />
Now anything further I'm going to say privately. Because as stated before people might get tired of this crazy player bumping this thread.</div></div><hr />
