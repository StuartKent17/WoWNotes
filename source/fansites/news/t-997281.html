Blizzard made major changes to Firelands a few times during Patch 4.2 (July 26th (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2393-Patch-4.2-Hotfixes-July-26) and Sept. 20th (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2466-Firelands-Raid-Hotfixes-Sept.-20)) to allow more players to see the Firelands content. We take a look at just how many more players were able to down Heroic Ragnaros and clear Normal Firelands. Data was looked at for over 2.7 million level 85 characters, most of them being in the US.<br />
<br />
Class balance for characters with the Heroic Ragnaros (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5803/heroic-ragnaros/) achievement was also graphed. The Heroic Firelands Boss Kill Ease graph displays the percentage of characters that have killed each boss, provided they have killed at least one of the Heroic Firelands bosses.<br />

Rag doesn't need more nerfs, people need to be less terrible at the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not surprising as they are the only class that can fill all 4 slots.<br />
And they don´t suck now so people like to play them more. :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durandro</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just shows that Rag heroic needs more nerfs, probably when 4.3 is released, not that many people will bother to go back just to kill him though.<br />
<br />
We'll all have superior gear, so in effect it will be 'nerfed' purely by having a new tier.<br />
<br />
Mind you, some people failed in Ulduar even with Icecrown gear. But then that place was extremely well tuned (and by that I mean ball breakingly difficult).</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol so they should make this stuff harder when barely 1000 people in the world have a kill in a game played by over 10 million people.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canbie</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This just proves that Blizz needs to severely nerf Heroic modes. Less then 3000 players are doing this? That is just wrong. Why are they making content for such a low percentage of players? Even normal modes, this is just hilarious.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gratlim</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let's see hum:<br />

Normal Fireland: 135k / 2,7m =5% <br />
Heroic Fireland: 2400/2700000 = 0,08 %<br />
<br />
I like how content post nerf was cleaned by only a 5,08% of the tested population post epic nerf. One word: scary....Hopefully we will be around 10% for normal mode by december.<br />
<br />
It looks like you've more chance to get Rivendale charger mount than killing H.Rag even after nerf. Funny</div></div><hr />

It's that they can't do it not they don't care. Bad players outweigh the good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair many of those characters could be alts that aren't used for raiding. <br />
<br />
When the DB is out of maintenance mode tomorrow maybe I can pull together some more stats that will give you an idea of what percent of people that have downed a boss this expansion and played in the last month are able to clear Firelands.</div></div><hr />

I so wish we had player housing... <br />

Why would you play a game where the sole purpose of and the selling points are to make your character more powerful to take on even more powerful foes?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Blizzard. Hi. Us bads only want to play our character up to a certain point, and then complain and cry on forums, cause we honestly aren't smart enough to figure out simple mechanics of moving our characters left or right during encounters and staying out of fire, so when you make raid encounters, make them appear difficult and scary, but don't actually ya know make them hard, asking us to push four buttons and move left and right is too much and too stressful, and oh make legendaries drop off trash mobs, cause like we pay $15.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Based on the figures in the graph and the number of people in the data pool:<br />
<br />
Only 0.1% of the 2.7mil population killed Heroic Rag AFTER the nerf....<br />
Onyl 5% of the population killed all bosses in Firelands on normal. Mind you ONLY 5% on normal. How can this even be called catering to the casuals.<br />
And going by these numbers, apperently only imba people visit MMO-Champ, seeing there so many more than the above percentage would have you expect that call the raids too easy.<br />
Or my previous point is flawed and a lot of people on MMO-Champ are lying about their experience with the difficulty</div></div><hr />

Err.... no.<br />
<br />
Did you guys read the graphs?<br />
~135,000 characters have defeated normal firelands, i.e. 7/7.<br />
<br />
Judging by my realm, if you count those who are 1/7 or more it would be a much, much higher percentage.</div></div><hr />

Think about what you just said.. Do you realize that most hc fights (the harder ones at least and esp raggy) is not really about being madskilled at pressing buttons. It's all in the details of how you refine your tactic. This ain't starcraft, you can only do as much as the global cd allow, which in best case scenario is 60 APM + a few off the gcd. <br />

Most guilds (or at least guilds that I've noticed) go kill H Shannox first, then go to H Rhyolith, then Alysrazor or Domo third. As far as H Rhyolith being easier on 25 man, I thought that was chuckle worthy.</div></div><hr />

ETA: We were one of those guilds that cleared Ragnaros in the first week post-nerf. It was actually a little irritating, because we were just getting a handle on the mechanics when he got nerfed and suddenly all of Firelands got stupid-easy.

<br />
When the DB is out of maintenance mode tomorrow maybe I can pull together some more stats that will give you an idea of what percent of people that have downed a boss this expansion and played in the last month are able to clear Firelands.<br />
<br />
Even if you focus the statistics down quite a bit I believe this is quite a sad state of affairs. With all the ease of content changes both in the raid game and in the game as a whole, I would have hoped to see at least a much higher number here. In general the knowledge that there is only 2.7million North American WoW player characters is disturbingly against what we are led to believe that are the current subscriber base of the game. If only have of those characters are alts we see a much smaller NA population than expected. Add in the fact that a good number of players now have 2-5 85s (me I have 7) and that dwindles that number more.<br />
<br />
If we could see more in depth numbers of not how many people have killed Ragnaros on either difficulty, but how many have killed each boss since the nerfs.<br />
<br />
Overall, id like to know how many players have logged in within the last 30 days and killed the majority of Firelands AND how many players who killed some things in firelands 2 months ago, havent logged in in the last 30 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The stats speak louder then any elitist words, and if somebody says some of those toons are alts, then damn obviously less people have actually been in firelands let alone killed a boss then the stats say. sure some people don't give a crap about raiding, these stats though are definitely the worse ever for wow. Blizz truly cares about money, which makes sense as a company who needs to pay employees, not like companies have volunteer/free services in their definition anywhere...<br />
<br />
I would expect the next raid patches overall to be much easier for all raid tiers, unless Blizz DGAF. If so...only time will tell what happens to WoW. Elitist should probably get over themselves, but that will never happen now will it?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaraxia</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely disagree - the elitist players need content too, it's completely unfair for them to clear it all in a month and then have to wait another 5 months for the next tier.

Sorry I disagree, casual players playing ~6 hours a week like yours can easily clear normal mode before the nerf. Those that still havn't by then can't really use the excuse &quot;Real life more important&quot;, they are simply bad at this game.</div></div><hr />

There are a lot more than 2.7 million level 85 characters. Another 2.6 million are in queue to be processed (combined US and EU) for at least 5 million. That is before the first pass is even done. I would imagine there are are least 6-7 million level 85 characters between the US and EU.<br />
<br />
I'll see about putting together another set of stats that talks more to player activity and normal raid progression among actual raiders.</div></div><hr />

On my realm 1 guild has killed heroic rag but about 10 are at 6/7. Every single guild is suffering from people quitting or just not showing up. And for heroic rag you need a stable group doing tries for a while.This has a lot to do with people being burned out or simply not having much to do in between raids.Please don't nerf him more though. My group would love to get him down eventually.. when we're not suffering from people on vacation or quitting the game.</div></div><hr />

And 5.031.814....% of level 85 characters have killed Normal Ragnaros. If only you could make a pass for players that have at least 1/7, or 0/7. I know that's a ridiculous statement and would be mostly pointless, but I'd like to see how many players haven't even downed a boss. Inacessible raids are inaccessible. I'm expecting more nerfs or the Raid Finder being pushed before 4.3, as unlikely as that sounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ICC was probably the most bland raid, because you were essentially full clearing it for a little less than a year.<br />
<br />
And it's still the same case, Heroic Lich King was a much much harder boss than any other in there.<br />

<br />
<br />
This is so true. <br />
<br />
I'm a full time student, I work part time and has a decent social life, albeit I dont sleep that much.<br />
<br />
So I get about 7h of WoW per week (2 raid sessions of 3h and around 1h per week of getting my things ready for raiding)<br />
<br />
Pre nerfs our guild was working on Normal Mode Ragnaros at a pretty casual speed, on Wed we'd clear all but rag and had sundays exclusively on Rag (nerfs hit at our 4th week of tries)<br />
<br />
Since the nerfs we can farm normal FL in about 2h so we did some heroic T11 to get some BiS for our group.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we've been doing one new heroic boss per week since that. (raided tonight and we are 3/7 Heroic (Shannox, Ryolith and just got Domo)<br />
<br />
We never got past Heroic Halfus in T11 and now we're making a decent-paced progression for a casual raiding guild. I know they nerfed Damage and Health on all encounters, but still the mechanics to follow are the same as they were. With the numbers nerfed we can make a steady progression. So the mechanics aren't that hard. <br />
<br />
People are just terrible at this game if they can't dodge Majordomo's cat leap or dispatch Rageface correctly in an Crystal Trap. The whole patch 4.0 'heroic dungeons are too hard qq' proved that the player base sucks. Raids can't get easier than heroic dungeons, that would be pretty dumb eh?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaeleena</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Learning curve is clearly out of proportion, the normal heroics are harder than the Zandalari heroics. The mechanics of the Zandalaari heroics are simplistic by nature. After you gear your character in ZA/ZG and farm out a couple of pieces of valor gear and get you full epic justice gear and step into a raid with only knowledge of mechanics from Zandalaari heroics, you're going to experience alot of trouble(with only 5% of the sample population being able to clear it). Then going from normal to heroic firelands you're looking at a 98% drop in people being able to clear the content(0.08% of the sample population).<br />

Have you even noticed that only 0.1% has kill Heroic Ragnaros now? I'd say that heroic then still is hard. Would like to see the statistics for other heroic boss kills. I think it's much lower than you'd expect by the number of complaints about how easy it is on these forums.</div></div><hr />

Less then 3000 players are doing this? That is just wrong. Why are they making content for such a low percentage of players? Even normal modes, this is just hilarious.<br />
<br />
They did severely nerf Heroic modes. that 'less than 3000', that's for the one hard fight left. I don't think it's too absurd for the final boss of the Heroic mode to actually be hard. IT'S HEROIC MODE. Something like 7,000 guilds are 6/7 heroic, and I'm sure many of those guilds, like mine, have multiple groups killing six 'hardmodes'. The whole point of Heroic Mode was so that there could be a raid that was both not-insanely-hard for the 'casuals', and challenging for the 'elite'. I consider myself a casual, a serious casual maybe, but my group isn't even working on H-Rag right now. We might after Blizzcon, but killing 6/7H and N-Rag is easy and fun for us. We may be ahead of the curve, but the numbers for H-Rag absolutely do not mean that H-FL needs more nerfs. Hundreds of thousands of people are killing heroic bosses, just not Rag, and that's not terrible.<br />
<br />
If it's Heroic, and killable, Blizzard doesn't need to nerf it, because that's what it's there for.</div></div><hr />

MMOs that cater solely to the hardcore faceplant monthly. I'm disappointed Blizzard wasn't able to learn from their mistakes while simultaneously cannibalizing them.<br />
I'd just like to say that it's not a 98% drop, as the percentage is 0.08%, not 2%.<br />
<br />
For every player that has cleared Heroic Firelands, there's 1,136 players that has cleared normal Firelands. More nerfs to heroic and normal please.<br />

Less then 3000 players are doing this?<br />
Out of 2.7m, that's 5%. Not as bad when compared to 11.1m, but still bad, I know.</div></div><hr />

Those that still havn't by then can't really use the excuse &quot;Real life more important&quot;, they are simply bad at this game.<br />
<br />
I personally don't care about this 'bad at this game' excuse. Whether or not you're good at it, you still pay the monthly fees. The point is Blizzard don't cater enough for casual players. 2 rehashed old content dungeons isn't enough to keep casual players going - and PvP is a complete and utter joke.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tust</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be curious to see a graph showing the number of 6/7 heroic guilds pre and post nerf vs the ones given here. The nerfs to H rag, while significant, were done before a majority of guilds really had much learning time on him anyway, so do little to prove how many guilds were stone walled at him. meanwhile the nerfs appear to have trippled or even quadrupled the number of guilds at 6/7 heroic. 7/7 normal only doubled. So I'd say the nerfs to heroics were quite significant. And yet, most of these guilds will not kill H Rag this tier, even after the nerfs. So knowing this, would show you just how many guilds are stonewalled at H Rag.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fraza</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The amusing part of the statistics is it's even fewer &quot;people&quot; than you think. I know that Riggnaros (Death Knight Tank, Blood Legion) has at least 2 other toons clearing H Ragnaros every week. There's plenty more just like him that have 2+ characters on their account killing him.<br />
I have one toon which I have cleared Ragnaros with. I have 2 alts at 85 which I do not use for raiding. If you viewed only my toons, you could say that only 33% of characters have cleared firelands, and I bet this 1-raider + x-alts is the case with many others in Altaclysm. So the statistics can also be skewed to show a lower number of actual people[b], and probably is.<br />
<br />
edit: the absolute number of people cannot be higher than the number of characters, and is probably lower, of course, but the [b]percentage of people who have cleared Rag/H Rag is probably higher than the percentage of characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I think normal Ragnaros could use more nerfing. Not a whole lot, just a bit like say, one less Son or 5% less damage from those seeds. Doubt such a case would happen, so my guild will just have to keep slogging through attempts on him. (Also, wtb Protector token off Staghelm.)<br />

Based on the figures in the graph and the number of people in the data pool:<br />
<br />
Only 0.1% of the 2.7mil population killed Heroic Rag AFTER the nerf....<br />
Onyl 5% of the population killed all bosses in Firelands on normal. Mind you ONLY 5% on normal. How can this even be called catering to the casuals.<br />
And going by these numbers, apperently only imba people visit MMO-Champ, seeing there so many more than the above percentage would have you expect that call the raids too easy.<br />
Or my previous point is flawed and a lot of people on MMO-Champ are lying about their experience with the difficulty<br />
<br />
<br />
You cant be serious, I mean cmon, did you even think about it .. really?<br />
<br />
How many of those 2.7 million players are ACTUALLY raiding? How many of THOSE are raiding like 3 times or 4 times a week which it takes to kill H rag even after the nerf (if you're not in the Top 50 guilds worldwide)<br />
And about the normal mode.. I would say not even 50% of wow players are really raiding. So many just do pvp and some just do 5mans/fooling around with friends/Bgs etc. If at all 50%, maybe even around 35 to 40%. 5% of the whole population is then actually over 15% of the raiding population. Which is ok I guess since a lot more ppl will be at 6/7, 5/7 whatever...<br />
How easy do you want the game to be? If 30% of the whole wow population would have killed rag then almost every raider would have downed him. How would you justifiy this as an &quot;achievement&quot;, if almost EVERY OTHER raider can kill the same boss as you. Might as well be a 5m heroic.<br />

You are getting your &quot;pug friendly&quot; mode next patch - so all your alts can get Deathwing kill without much problem. I'd say that should be enough, seeing how it's all about &quot;seeing the content&quot; and it's not like Ragnaros legs is much of a content - I certainly don't remember that many people crying about Sinestra, and that was an entirely new boss. On top of that, we can stop saying &quot;X out of ten million people&quot;, since obviously not everyone wants to raid - and out of those, not everyone wants to easily kill heroic mode end boss. <br />
<br />
Ragnaros will probably get more nerfs anyway. Most of the stuff that wipes you wasn't really affected by 15% damage nerf - because it hardly matters if you're hit for 500k or 450k. Yeah, you might survive one more tick of Superheated, doesn't matter since Geyser, Meteor, Sulfuras or failure to deal with Dreadflame will still wipe you. P4 is still RNG heavy, and you still can't place Lightwell/Barrier on half of the platform, now that's something that is truly &quot;wtf Blizzard&quot; ;) <br />
<br />
Of course, very soon this won't matter - once T13 hits, H T12 will be forgotten. Those who complain the loudest won't bother with somewhat difficult bosses, since LFR will offer comparable rewards for fraction of effort.</div></div><hr />

2376 players in the sample cleared Heroic Firelands. 135859 players in the sample cleared Normal Firelands. 2376 is 1.7% of 135859. That's a 98.3% drop in the number of players that can clear Normal Ragnaros to the number of Players that can clear Heroic Ragnaros. There are not 1,136 players that have cleared Normal Firelands for every 1 player who has cleared Heroic Firelands. There are only 57 players who have cleared Normal Firelands for every player who has cleared Heroic Firelands (135859/2375=57.179).

Raid finder will change everything though, everybody will be able to get through the raid on easy mode.

Another 2.6 million are in queue to be processed (combined US and EU) for at least 5 million. That is before the first pass is even done. I would imagine there are are least 6-7 million level 85 characters between the US and EU.<br />
<br />
I'll see about putting together another set of stats that talks more to player activity and normal raid progression among actual raiders.<br />
<br />
Would love to see that chart over the full data. I doubt it will change much in the ratios but people still can claim that it's incomplete set currently.<br />
Also regarding the normal progression, couldn't you graph over the statistics? Because in contrast to achievements they also track normal bosses. Really would love to see the last graph for normal mode raiding simply to see how that compares (especially staghelm and ragnaros).<br />
<br />
To me this definitely shows that any form of complaint about difficulty being to low or even lower than in earlier expansions are completely void. Heroic raiding is for the top guilds currently (and I mean after the nerfs). But maybe it's actually only the ~2500 people who killed Ragnaros heroic that are complaining on the forums that the game is to easy...<br />
<br />
But enough with the complaining about complainers. While I doubt the LFR will help me in any shape or form (either because I'm incompetent or not patient enough to wait through dozens of groups until I see a success), I guess it will push these numbers much higher for TDS raid. I'm really interested in how they plan to tune this down to make it viable and especially how they design the problem that occurs when you can't finish the raid in one run and suddenly have loads of people with different progressions (if you have to start over this could mean you never see any progress and I guess discourages people to run after the first weekly run didn't finish the raid)</div></div><hr />

From a business perspective, what you're preaching for is unsustainable and has been proven time and time again.<br />
<br />
People have different ideas of what they think is fun. Clearly Wrath revolutionized what an MMO is supposed to be and actually changed alot of peoples minds about what was fun.<br />
<br />
Markets change. Imagine that.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to point out that according to WoW progress only 591 guilds have downed H Rag, while 22,527 guilds have killed Normal Rag. 591 is 2.6% of 22,527. Which means 2 things, their numbers are within a 1% margin of error, and it's actually worse than reported by WoWprogress.<br />

Guess we can all skew statistics?<br />
<br />
3250 25M kill vs 19326 10M kills<br />
196 25H Kills vs 407 10H kills<br />
6% 2.1%<br />
<br />
So 10M's are clearly harder right?</div></div><hr />

That depends on your group makeup. Mine is geting by the transition without a boomer or an ele shaman for KB's, We do have quite a few stuns and crazy burst potential though.

Barely anyone will bother with Firelands since LFR will be released, and will only work with Dragonsoul :S Also Shaman least represented class for Rag Heroic lol<br />
<br />
Well Shamans are the 3rd least played or the 8th most played class depending on you point of view, only behind Warlocks and Rogues. So it's not all that surprising, these numbers aren't definitive by any means without knowing how many are alts. Remember it only goes by achievements and I know someone that has 3 toons that have cleared normal and 2 have cleared heroic so far. Alt runs skew the numbers in these measurements and without the numbers that Blizzard has, meaning how many main toons cleared the content, we will never know with a certainty.<br />
<br />
If anything your Hybrid counterparts fill their roles better. Druids have amazing heals and Balance which is blowing it up right now. Paladins have great heals and tanking. Priests have great healing and dps right now. Shamans do good dps/heals, but I think it still relates more to the percentage played and how fun the classes are or aren't, which also heavily effects alt choices. That can tend to skew numbers and make shamans seem underrepresented.</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile people just forget there's a Normal mode over 30% of raiders cleared pre-nerfs.

<br />
Hardcore MMOs are doomed to failure because they only attract a tiny fraction of players.<br />
<br />
This is just utter bullshit. WoW has become nothing BUT more accessible to people as time has gone on. The lack of progression raiding, the 'leave no-one behind' badge systems, having to have a separate raiding difficulty just to keep hard bosses in the game (because everyone's entitled to clear a tier of raiding, right!).<br />
<br />
Not only that but your demands are so utterly vague; what portion of the population should be able to kill HC Ragnaros then? 30%? 50%? 75%? They're all paying for it after all, right? You seriously believe a boss tuned to be killable by the majority of the population to offer any sort of challenge to people who even know how to gem and reforge their character? I'm sure all those people who have nothing to do for another six months until another major patch will keep their subscriptions going. For sure.</div></div><hr />

You're commenting on a poor representation, unless sarcasm is intended. Because the data is skewed in such a way that &quot;only 10%&quot; have downed, the whole &quot;tier is too hard&quot; is a bad basis for argument. If you where to compare T11 Raid stats vs T12 would be better as guilds downing bosses is down 48%. This is not saying 48% of WoW quit, but 48% of raider are missing, and to break it down more of that the most significant drop off was T11 10M -&gt; T12 10M(97.3% 25M vs 57.1% 10M).

<br />
I agree that WoW has become more accessible, but Cataclysm was a step backwards. And I personally believe that Heroic Rag shouldn't be seen by only the top 0.5% of the raiding population, just like Gladiator is awarded. I mean, 31% success rate on Baleroc, 2% success rate on Ragnaros. It makes a pretty S curve. But I think a 10 to 20% success rate would be better, if only for the statistics.</div></div><hr />

This data is very difficult to handle as it is not a complete set, and is character based and not player based. I understand this. I was trying to make an argument that a player with a server full of level 85s could still be a player that hasn't downed Heroic Rag, and that a player with only 1 level 85 could have downed Heroic Rag.<br />
<br />
Skewy is skewy. But I'm still quite happy with &quot;95% of level 85s haven't killed Ragnaros Normal, he's still too difficult&quot;. Even though that's not my problem with raids. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Latter. The encounters in regular Firelands do not have difficult mechanics to master. But the huge amount of people who can't even manage to avoid the slow missile damage in the Heroic ZG Jin'do fight proves that some people are completely unable to comprehend to move to avoid damage. And in a lot of Firelands fights, there are many &quot;move or die&quot; things. Which really, Blizzard shouldn't remove.</div></div><hr />

Pre-nerf, less than 1% of the players had killed Ragnaros Normal. Only about 0.02% (one in 5000!) had killed Ragnaros Heroic. Now that number has doubled, so 2% of the players have killed him on normal and 0.05% have killed him <br />

It's the only way to keep people who need a challenge, yes need, playing without upsetting people like you. But yet you are here complaining about one boss out of 14 bosses (7 normal and 7 hardmode).<br />
<br />
All these people have is bashing their heads against one boss that hey already cleared on normal for weeks. Yet people have the guts to complain that it's too hard and everyone should be able to kill him on hardmode. Like you don't have plenty of other things that are accessible enough.<br />
<br />
10-20% sounds good to you but it's way too high. Those 10-20% will have nothing to do for several months other than farming and since when is that fun?<br />
<br />
Having a tiered progression like in TBC with nerfs like they made now in Firelands over time would be much better. This way people don't have to complain every tier about not being able to &quot;see&quot; content. <br />
<br />
<br />
If they would have made LK HC (or ICC hardmodes in general) as accessible as you want it to be then they would have lost way more people even before Cataclysm.<br />
I really don't get it. You can see the nearly exact same fight on normal. The only thing you get from killing them on hardmode is seeing 2 or 3 mechanics and the exact same gear but a few ilvls higher. If you can't even let better or more active players have that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys realize this dataset counts my druid herbalist alt and my mage that I haven't played in 4 months as 'someone that can't clear noob content', right? Throw those in with the large population of the game that just doesn't give a crap about raiding, and your 'not even 10%' becomes much less impressive.<br />
<br />
There are something like 15,000 US guilds that have some raiding presence this tier, they've recorded at least one boss kill. Nearly all of those are at least to Ragnaros. Half have killed him. About 2,000 US guilds are 6/7 Heroic. Compare that to the percentage of guilds who killed Sapphiron in Vanilla, or the percentage who killed M'uru in BC. Realize that the entire concept of Heroic Mode is designed to do one thing; allow the existence of raids that are challenging to that type of raider who was doing doing Naxx40, or Sunwell back in the day, while simultaneously allowing the existence of a raid that's not prohibitively difficult for the Average Joe. &quot;Getting everyone to see the content&quot; as the buzzphrase goes, instead of having the high end of raiding prohibitively out of reach.<br />

I can assure you that in Burning Crusade you didn't have half of the raiding population with Illidan down four months after Black Temple's 2.1 release and almost all of the rest of them having at least heard &quot;You Are Not Prepared&quot; in person. Your average half-way-decent raider didn't even set foot in Hyjal or BT until the attunements were lifted in 2.4, ten months later.<br />
<br />
Firelands is not perfect, but this data set absolutely does not demonstrate that it's recklessly difficult. Right now your average raider is either killing Heroics or just starting on them (42.78% of US guilds have a Heroic Shannox kill). Considering that Heroics aren't even for the average raider (in theory), I cannot see how this can be construed as a casual-unfriendly raid environment. H-Rag is hard, way harder than the rest of the zone; he's the one bastion of Heroic Mode currently, and that's fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Addressing your previous post:<br />
<br />
Raids are actually shorter now compared with the slogs through MC etc, therefore they are making it more accessible and require less overall time at the relevant gear levels so therefore they knew it was taking time and addressed it.<br />
<br />
In relation to this one, Casual is the wrong term here I guess. This would be a case of being 'differently skilled' or gear level separation due to the amount of time spent rather than intelligence. Its not hard capping VP's in a week though, I had managed to get all available items for my primary spec in a few weeks of capping out and I don't do hardcore hours.</div></div><hr />

Raid access is a great problem at the moment (hence the Raid Finder in 4.3), as well as difficulty. I'm pretty sure that casuals don't find ZA/ZG difficult.<br />
<br />
I seriously can't believe someone can say this. Raid access is a great problem? How come? There are no attunements, getting gear is no problem at all (you are even overgeared when you get all those justice/valor gear) and it is fairly easy to pug if you are not on a very low populated realm so you don't even have to go to the process of finding a guild. They made raids shorter (less bosses per raid) only for pugs because pugs normally don't finish the raid the next day when they stop halfway. You barely have to do anything to get consumables, yet people still manage to not use them. Gold is easy to get so you can enchant/reforge your gear.<br />
So what is it that you want? Instant groups? Clearing a raid in 20 minutes? Gear send to your mailbox as soon as you hit 85? Seriously, tell me.<br />
<br />
Let's talk about difficulty. Difficulty has nothing to do with casual players except when you are talking about LK HC or Rag HC because they just take a lot of time to learn and clear (there is a possibility that you don't have enough time to finish it). I think guilds that raid 2 or 3 evenings (3 hours) a week are perfectly able to clear everything. Raiding 3x3 hours is nothing special. When you raid once a week you possibly won't be able to kill bosses like Rag HC or you have to be in a really good guild. When you pug you have no chance at all in hardmodes.<br />
When something is too difficult you or your raid simply is not good enough. It has nothing to do with you being casual. Besides you have normal modes which are on a very reasonable difficulty and they even do small nerfs pretty fast after release and do big nerfs (15-30%) later on. Not accessible my ass.<br />
<br />
Now they even introduce LFR on even easier difficulty. When you have 10-20% that kill HC Ragnaros then how many percent will clear LFR, 100%? It would be pointless to introduce LFR then if they make endgame hardmodes and especially the final boss that easy.<br />
<br />
I am getting pretty sick of this accessiblity complaining when this is the easiest MMO ever, when they focus 90% on accessibility, when they do so many things to let people enter raids.</div></div><hr />

You still have something to look out for. I guess you will never understand that. As long as you get your epics and achievements right?<br />
Plus you are actually farming for something (Ragnaros). You can farm gear for the next tier but it's not like you need it unless you are going for world first. Doing normal T13 with heroic T12 gear is not needed at all.</div></div><hr />

The majority of guilded players with raid spots are. I don't know where you get 2%, the data in the OP says that 5% of 85s have killed Ragnaros, with no consideration given to alts/inactives/pvpers/othernonraiders.<br />

<br />
You forget though that a lot of players also simply don't want to raid for whatever reason, so that number is really not representative (think of PvPers, or people who can't care enough). Also, something always has to be inattainable or give you a feeling of 'still to do' in a game such as WoW, in this case, heroic or maybe certain normal bosses you can't kill (or can't kill yet), provides this feeling. I myself remember quite clearly in my 'casual' days in TBC - I knew full well I would not (and did not) want to raid beyond Zul'Aman, yet I did not envy the people who did. Even if the content had been easier and therefore pugfriendly, I'm not sure I would have dared venture there. That sense though, is what kept me going, I did my thing while I knew the possibilities essentially, for me, where limitless.<br />
<br />
Compared to now, however, where I downed heroic rag weeks ago, I feel myself at a loss what to do. I still didn't complete my legendary, so that's really the last thing I can accomplish PvE wise for the moment, as the rest of my BiS list is, aside from a few items, pretty much complete too. I wonder, if we assume that the majority of the WoW community could &quot;finish&quot; a patch like the &quot;elitist&quot; people do, if this would truly do the game any good. I personally believe it won't and ultimately will cause a loss of subscriptions - what keeps you playing when you feel you're 'done' with the game or current patch? (edit: what keeps ME playing is preparing our guild for the next patch, so we're farming more gear for everyone, and we're looking at going on the PTR, etc., except people who're not in such a 'serious' guild won't care for all that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly right. On top of the fact that Druids have 2 very competitive specs (healing and ranged dps), they can potentially fill every single raid role, an advantage that is unique to their class only. That is at least partial reason for their high representation. If compared to other classes that are capable to heal, Shaman representation is abyssal. Elemental is decent spec for HC Raggy due to knockback. Enhancement is terrible. Restoration is beyond broken. But Blizzard doesn't care.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's kind of the thing, druid representation on Rag is likely high because of moonkins and their unbeatable AoE and knockback. Shaman really can't compete with that, and their knockback is all over the place too.<br />

We did raid rag hc with a resto shaman yesterday and the difference compared to our usual healing setup was really impressive (in the negative sense). Doable, of course, yet gimped.</div></div><hr />

Realistically, that number is probably closer to 950, considering player swaps on subsequent kills. According to these statistics, 4 days later, only 235 characters had killed HRag.<br />
<br />
I would assume that when these say &quot;most of them being in the US&quot;, what is meant is &quot;entirely being in the US.&quot; Because 235 is an appropriate number for only the United States. Displaying raid statistics that ignore Europe and Asia is stupid, considering they're the more talented raiding continents. Also, the biggest nerf that ever hit HRag was the 20% stealth health nerf which hit 2 weeks prior to the blanket Firelands nerf, and the mainpage isn't listing it. It dramatically softened the 2-meteor and dreadflame sweeping requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, taking the amount of 25-man guilds having killed heroic Ragnaros (196) and multiplying it by 30, which still seems quite low, we get 5880 characters having killed Ragnaros heroic. This is on 25-man alone.</div></div><hr />

But Cata kind of misses the variety in things you can do beside raiding, so more people look for something to do, see raiding and want to do it to enjoy their time in wow.<br />
I think Blizzard should just stop caring about stupid 24/7 players who insta-grind shit and add at least a few more grindy elements that you can just do for short periods of playtime.<br />
<br />
All the gating severly limits the things you can do on a character.<br />
<br />
What I wish is shorter 5mans again and more options to get rep with factions (tbc style turn ins for diversity among all the dailies) just so people have something to do, fill a bit of &quot;I'm bored right now&quot; time without being forced to go all in for 1hour. For the future I think it would be a good idea to keep the most recent batch of 5mans the level we're used in Cata but make all the old ones wotlk style rush fest.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm playing BGs with my hunter when I have those &quot;I'm bored right now&quot; moments, because the time slots they fill are simply shorter and so allow me better controlling the time I spend, it's easier to say &quot;Okay I can fit another BG in there before I need to do something else&quot; than doing that for 5mans currently. And that sucks. I like doing PvE, especially because I'm really bad ad PvP with most of my other characters. I also like grinding stuff once in a while. I want to be able to control for myself how much time I want to spend a day gaining rep with a certain faction. Dailies are nice but what to do when they're done and I still want to spend more time with my character?<br />
<br />
It's not that I don't want to raid or can't raid for some reason - it's just that raids take to large of a time slot at once for me. I don't like binding me to one activity for that long, especially if it's uncertain how it will turn out (I have no problem spending a whole day playing Civilization, Sims, Mass Effect, Minecraft or similiar engaging games without even noticing how much time I spent, I'm okay with that because I'm able to stop playing anytime which is the smallest time slot possible)<br />
<br />
Like you I really don't envy people who raid heroic firelands. I really don't wish want them to nerf firelands so much I can run them I understand that the way I play the game isn't suited for raiding. (Even though I think these numbers show that even for those who want to spend so much time with the game, it's still to challenging at least some of the content)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is ONLY ONE CONCLUSION that you can draw from the statistics presented and that is:<br />
<br />
BLIZZARD ACHIEVED THEIR OBJECTIVE OF DRAMATICALLY INCREASING FIRELAND'S PROGRESSION AS A RESULT OF THE MASSIVE NERFS ON SEPTEMBER 20TH ONLY.<br />
<br />
The earlier nerf did not dramatically increase progression rates.<br />
<br />
You also CANNOT SAY, with certainty, that the nerfs were the sole reason for the progression. Rate of gear accumulation and increasing participation, as a result of the normal return of players after summer break, have to be accounted for as well<br />
<br />
You CANNOT say that only a certain % of all players have completed Firelands because only 2.5 million were sampled.<br />
<br />
You COULD say, based on the sample size, that for every 2.5 million characters (that’s alts etc not accounts) roughly “X” % will have cleared Firelands. <br />
<br />
So, to get a REMOTELY ACCURATE idea as to the total number of players that have cleared Firelands you would have to know the total number of level 85 characters (NOT TOTAL SUBSCIBERS).<br />
<br />
For example if there are 10 million subscribers and each has 3 max level characters then you would have to multiply the data presented by 12 (10 mil x 3 / 2.5 mil)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, because you have NO IDEA what portion of the 2.5 million characters sampled were active players you CAN’T SAY with CERTAINTY whether or not multiplying the data presented by a factor of 12 would present an accurate result because you DON'T KNOW what portion of those 2.5 million were active accounts.<br />
<br />
To be very honest the data presented is virtually worthless and fairly irresponsible from any scientific standard.<br />

You do realize quotes like this make you look stupid. Doing heroic modes is not just personal skill but the ability of a team to execute properly. I know some good players who will miss out on achievements because they stick with their friends over loot drops that are moot the next patch. Some we have to encourage to do runs with sister guilds so that they can get done what we know they can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overall I personally end up raiding less over each tier than the average raiding guild does. I'm fine with putting in the initial hours for this benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, these numbers do not match with the overall ones. Even assuming all the registered Ragnaros normal kills were done by 7 people each, I come up with ~160k characters having killed it. Now taking the 25-man guilds (3253) and multiplying them with just 20 to take massively into account people changing guilds and other factors such as characters being shared on 25-man and 10-man kills, and taking the 10-man guilds (19350) and multiplying them with just 7, I already get a total of ~200k characters.<br />
<br />
Original post does state that most of the characters are from NA so the lacking numbers are likely mostly from EU or perhaps even NA (I'm doubtful about 2.7 million being the amount of level 85 NA characters) and you should only treat these given ones as a percentage out of the stated 2.7 million.</div></div><hr />

I don't take sides because its no use. From my experience its very hard to set up a 25 or even 10 player roster which just are just good players, even more when from time to time some of them think its time to cancel their subscription, RL has to find a new one which might not be as good and so the raids end up with like 50% being good and the rest doing ok which isnt enough for most herioc encounters, so don't generalize that much.</div></div><hr />

They aren't really there for those 5000 (or whatever number of people that have cleared him) But just something to be looked at and admired or hated, depending on how you look at the world.... of warcraft. Now what do i mean? lets say they remove heroic ragnaros from the game. just straight up removed any boss like that. that would only affect that 0.05 (or whatever) percent of people that cleared him. But how many people would actually be mad about them removing him? TONS. And many people would quit, even though they never had a shot at them realistically. It wouldnt affect them in anyway whatsoever. He's a figure head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's talk about difficulty. Difficulty has nothing to do with casual players except when you are talking about LK HC or Rag HC because they just take a lot of time to learn and clear (there is a possibility that you don't have enough time to finish it). Not accessible my ass.<br />
<br />
Now they even introduce LFR on even easier difficulty. When you have 10-20% that kill HC Ragnaros then how many percent will clear LFR, 100%? It would be pointless to introduce LFR then if they make endgame hardmodes and especially the final boss that easy.<br />
LFR. Easy, quick, time-restrictless system that lets me raid when I want to, with the general populace and not a server, and with a populace that don't restrict entry into raids. Long story short, I'm at uni, uni block vent, and I was guildless after I downed LK, and have no achievements except from PuGs. I'm 12/13 T11 Normal, missing Nef, all from PuGs I've built up, and have no way of seeing Heroic mode. I'm currently 0/7 Firelands because I'm effectively locked in a vanity guild of myself and alts, as no guild takes me because I have no previous tier experience and no Vent. LFD made making PuGs for dungeons pointless. LFR should have made PuGs for raids pointless. But, Easy difficulty now, so I'll take half a biscuit over no biscuit. <br />
<br />
I hope you're happy that you got at least that much information out of me. I'm more than geared for Firelands, just no access, and the only solution for me is LFR.<br />
<br />
Difficulty isn't a problem for me. Difficulty was never a problem for me when I raided in Wrath. I should be ready for Firelands. No access.<br />
<br />
LFR at 100% is probably a good goal. It's there for storyline, not difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Theres 6 other bosses you can experience. Casuals have enough content, they don't need to experience all of it. Hey if you havent downed heroic rag, maybe its cuz you arent good enough, not that the content is too difficult. We cant all kill the hardest boss in game, just like we cant all be the heroes that save the world irl. It is the last boss in the game, and there is a certain degree of epicness and exclusiveness involved. It is what distinguishes the elite from the casual. The rest of us can do normal and stuff. This game already takes less concentration/skill than most other games out there. I do feel like, however, blizzard needs to make the content difficult in terms of execution, not difficult in terms of stacking raid comp.</div></div><hr />

They need to be there, there has to be some kind of challenge for all levels of players. I haved played the game on and off during all the expansions, spent hours wiping on &quot;easy&quot; bosses in T5, in groups with players of very mixed ability. The game would not have felt as epic back then if there would not have been all those other bosses I could only dream about defeating. Now, for once, I am actually in a guild with a solid 10 man raid group. Everyone knows how to play their class, everyone has a brain and knows how to behave. We raided casually 1-2 timers per week and got 6/7 HC like 7 weeks ago. The the nerfs hit Ragnaros HC, who we had not even tried at that point. We put in some extra efort and raided 5 times during a 10 day period, which gave us the kill and a realm first. Ragnaros is _seriously_ not hard if you focus a bit and put in some effort, and tbh, could you really ask for anything less for the final boss of a patch?</div></div><hr />

How would you justifiy this as an &quot;achievement&quot;, if almost EVERY OTHER raider can kill the same boss as you. Might as well be a 5m heroic.<br />
Ridicolous.<br />
<br />
It's an achievement if you do it pre-nerf. Perhaps if you're among the first few guilds that kill a boss, then it's an achievement. After a certain amount Blizzard lowers the difficulty to enable more people to see it. The 'achievemnt' getters have run their race and that's played out anyway. So Blizzard 'caters to the casuals'. But if you look at these numbers then that is not even as strong as a lot of people would like you to think. That's my point.<br />
And yes, I agree that not the entire population raids and that if only a mere 35% of them do. That would still mean that only 15% has killed Ragnaros on normal. Considering the amount the encounters were nerfed, it's fair to say that catering to the casuals is not that much true, since only 15% has managed to kill him by now. <br />
My point is not that is should be made easier, my point is that it apparently isn't that easy judging by these numbers, at least for 85% of the population (extrapolated from you assumption that only 35% does raid). Ergo, catering to the casuals is not as big as expected.</div></div><hr />

When I did, it was in an extremely casual setting with a guild that was mainly about having fun on Vent while we sometimes took down bosses. We usually got to the end of a tier by the start of the next one - and long after many other guilds had...but we didn't really care because we got to see all the content. As you can imagine, we didn't really do much in the way of heroic / hard modes...but we didn't really care because we got to see ALL the content. Heroic modes of the same boss aren't new content. They are versions of the same content that everyone gets that are specifically designed to be challengin enough for a small subset of the raiding population - the hardcore raiders. Some people are talking on this thread like even the most casual or raider should get to beat heroic Ragnaros because the paid for the content...which is just ridiculous. The vast majority of development time for a raid is done for normal modes - development that heroic modes also use. The design of the environments, the basic boss mechanics, the modelling and skinning, the sounds and the spell effects. Heroic content development is simply adding some extra abilities and occasionally mechanic, increasing health pools and tweaking damage output. There was a grand total of one extra artwork project for heroic content (Rags with legs). You paid your money, and if you've raided and gotten to at least 6/7 this tier then you have seen all the content (unless you killed the 6th boss and didn't even go into the last boss' room). Blizzard has made a fairly cheap concession to a small but significant number of players who need more challenge that you do - and has given them the chance to do the exact same fights again, but harder. But the only way this concession is valuable to that group is if it *is* too hard for people who are more casual in their play. So to argue that having only a small number of people have killed this same boss with the extra phase means that Blizzard isn't doing it's job and that it should nerf the encounter is just....silly.</div></div><hr />

That's still less than 1% of the level 85 playerbase. You can argue about how many are alts, or never tried... all of these may have some logic behind them, but that doesn't really change the raw data.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don't see why folks are complaining about heroic content being a waste to implement. Most heroic encounters (afaik) seem to work the same as normal, with much higher health pools and damage. It's not like they're revamping entire instances for heroic raiders.</div></div><hr />

But it is still resumed to 3 spells: Flameshock - Lava Burst - Lightning bolt. They also need in-built haste and a more normap Spellpower ratio.Regarding the thing with nerfs - self explanatory - they brought the latest raid in game to the level where it can be easily cleared by every above average player, a thing which gives me an idea about wha twill they do after cataclysm with 'give everything to the hardcore', or better said what they consider to be a hardcore player.So, they where right when they said that WoW died with LK. RIP WoW.-----Just my 2 cent-----</div></div><hr />

Less I'm sure, since this is based on 'characters' and not accounts, with several people who probably clear on multiple toons. I'm not saying it's because the content is hard, but if it's because people aren't interested in doing it, I'd say that's nothing to brag about either. So what I take away, in my extremely bias view, is that WoW has 10 million subscribers, but very few are actively participating in the game's newest content. (Yeah Yeah, people PvP, but I said newest content, Cata BGs aren't newest content and weren't that great anyway)</div></div><hr />

I am in the 209th US guild, 6/7 prenerf heroic modes (Normal Rag down week 2 after FL came out) with 4 legendary staffs (3 earned 1 xfered in) Our lowest dps is above the 75% on raid bots and we still can not get Rag down... <br />
<br />
<br />
Please tell me how bad I am? Tell me how bad we suck and how dumb we are because we cant do it again? We are very good players and have yet to see meatball phase... so take your bullsh*t talk somewhere else please. Heroic Rag is hard even post nerf, its not the mechanics which are fairly simple for us, its the dps requirement that comes with it.<br />

Well, you might be very good but you still are not good enough. Your players are not bad but they still are worse than the ones in guilds that have killed hc ragnaros.

I'm sure all those people who have nothing to do for another six months until another major patch will keep their subscriptions going. For sure.<br />
<br />
The problem with your argument is this:<br />
<br />
The majority of people don't have 4 hours four times a week that they can dedicate to playing WOW. The majority of wow players (casuals) are getting bored. Farming the same 2 dungeons to get valor to get a bit of extra gear. Pugs are not an option because pugs require 7/7. Guilds want commitment to raiding 2/3/4/5 times a week at a predefined time. A lot of people know how to gem/enchant but can't commit. It's those people that are keeping your precious game alive by funding patches. Not the 0.1% of elitists who feel that the content is too easy and is catering for &quot;casuals&quot;. Everyone comes here and complains about how easy the raids are when Blizzard nerf the content after a couple of months. Let me tell you a secret, you can't be that good if it takes you longer than that to complete the content when you are raiding 15 to 20 hours a week.<br />
<br />
If you really feel that you need a challenge then switch some of your gear for lower level items and try again. It will certainly be a lot tougher. The real truth is that the majority of people complaining either haven't done the content or don't like the idea of other people (who spend less time on wow than them) getting equivalent gear. Who cares if someone else has &quot;welfare epics&quot;. It's those &quot;welfare epics&quot; that are funding the new content every 4 months for you. How much content do you really think you would get with the 0.1% of players as the only funders?</div></div><hr />

You should have a choice how you want to experience all the content, not be denied of it. Would be weird if you were reading a book, but would not get the final chapter unless you could prove you read all the previous chapters thoroughly. <br />
<br />
That's even the reason why lots of games have cheat modes, because developers realize that people need to be able to see all the stuff in the end, and not throw it in a corner because they hit a wall. If you're skilled enough to do it the hard way, bless you. But not every player has the same skills or even time to master the skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
All modern games have multiple difficulties and they all have one very high difficulty so people can never get bored because it's too easy for them. No one complains when they can't finish GoW 3 on insane or CoD on hardcore. Yet here in WoW it's a problem. <br />
<br />
It's also very weird that people never really complained that much when hardmodes weren't nerfed for more 'casual' players. Then Blizzard does do it because of their own reasons, then people raiding hardmodes complain because they don't want 15% nerfs in hardmodes (in the middle of the expansion (at the end of the expansion it's expected)) and all of a sudden they get jumped on by people who think hardmode Ragnaros is too hard for casual raiders while those raiders have no reason to kill him on hardmode. They got to see the fight on normal, so the &quot;book&quot; has ended, they experienced the story and the whole raid (which is what everyone wanted). The hardmode version has very very minor differences (except this time Ragnaros has legs, first time they made a hardmode with a new fase), a few mechanics, increased health and damage which doesn't give you any satisfaction at all and the same exact gear but only a few ilvls higher.<br />
The only reason they want to kill him in hardmode is for braggin rights and showing off or just because of jeaulousy. Besides that some people also feel the need to bash anyone who does want to be challenged in a game which also shows that they are just jeaulous.<br />
<br />
I guess when you pay for another game and can't finish it on hardcore/insane difficulty you also tell them to lower the difficulty because there is only a small amount of people who can pull it off and you have the right to finish hardcore/insane because you payed for it. I really doubt it. I have never seen anyone do that other than on WoW. It's just this mindset of people in this community but if you think about it it makes no sense at all. The rewards you get from normal and hardmode are nearly the same now just like other modern games. For example in GoW 3 you unlock an achievement for finishing the campaign on insane. I don't know if it's in GoW 3 but you can also unlock for example a weapon skin or character. It's practically the same.<br />
<br />
p.s. You aren't denied of anything. When you read a book but you don't have time for it then you can't finish it or you can't finish it as fast as someone else. If you have problems reading you will also finish the book later than someone who can read a page in one second.<br />
<br />
You are perfectly able to see and finish the content that is available. How you do it is up to you. You can do it in the dark or with a readinglight, you can do it without your glasses on or with your glasses on. If you feel like you don't want to turn on the light and someone else does want to stand up to turn on the light then don't blame anyone else but yourself.</div></div><hr />

No, its not about working for it at all. Wow presently favours the people who spend the most time in game, not the most skilled.<br />

End of story. If you can commit to raiding 5 days a week, 5 hours a day, you will clear the content and get geared quicker than someone who plays twice a week. End game only favours groups and groups require commitment in terms of time. Unfortunately, the majority of players have a life and are not able to pour hours and hours into the game.</div></div><hr />

I agree with most of your post aside from this. There is absolutely nothing stopping anyone from forming their own PUG, with their own requirements.

Then these players should be smart enough to understand that they can't expect to get everything that the people that work hard and a lot for it do. Just because you paid for your Windows 7 or w/e, do you expect to instantly beat the highest difficulty level in Chess Titans? Probably not. If you don't wish to spend hours on learning how to play chess, then you have 9 other difficultylevels to choose from. I doubt anyone is sending angry emails to Bill Gates that just because they have &quot;life&quot; as opposed to people who spent time learning how to play chess, they should be granted the ability to beat the hardest levels in it.

The game isn't diffcult at all. Hell, i have people dying in Alysrazor tornadoes post nerf, and still i can kill it easily. <br />
<br />
Bad players exists, but they aren't the cause stopping people from raiding. It's a mix of: <br />
- no feeling towards other players/solo-maniacs <br />
- not wanting to invest time on something <br />
- Wrath residues <br />
<br />
The fact is, players want to raid. Players would like to down heroic bosses. But they don't do it. because thay don't care of putting up a serious group, don't care about teamwork, they just want to nuke big bosses and feel awesome with their new purples. Most of the people just raided through PUGs in Wrath, now they don't do anything since they don't have gust to create one. They literally want the things handed to them with minimal effort. <br />
<br />
It's not about farming flasks or learing the class, it's about &quot;i play the game and i want to kill stuff, so i can prove i'm better&quot;. I. I. I. I. Too bad WoW is a game for WE. The graphs show only this. Millions of people pay and play, they all have the same opportunities, but still they don't understand it's an MMO and pretend they can do everything by themselves.<br />
<br />
People scream for nerfs because they want to things alone, they don't feel right to need the help of someone else. All guilds that do some raiding have accomplished something - vast majority of players don't even belong to a guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might find this interesting then. Only 50.1% of the characters sampled have the Heroic ZA achievement. Only 23% have earned the 5000 Valor Points achievement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is ONLY ONE CONCLUSION that you can draw from the statistics presented and that is:<br />
<br />
BLIZZARD ACHIEVED THEIR OBJECTIVE OF DRAMATICALLY INCREASING FIRELAND'S PROGRESSION AS A RESULT OF THE MASSIVE NERFS ON SEPTEMBER 20TH ONLY.<br />
<br />
The earlier nerf did not dramatically increase progression rates.<br />
<br />
Yup, that was all this data was intended to show, not how hard the bosses are overall. That could come later by filtering down to players active in the last month that have earned at least 5k valor points, or maybe have killed at least one raid boss in Firelands. Trying to claim that Firelands is hard because alts aren't raiding it is silly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe pool is all who killed at least 1 heroic boss. So 97.4% of those who scored at least 1 hc kill killed Shannox.<br />
<br />
Yup!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IS there a further breakdown of numbers for 10 and 25 man? I'd like to see how many 10m heroic Rag kills there are before and after nerf.<br />

The wait for a decent pug is around an hour to get decently geared people who are prepared to go on a pug that does not need achievements. so if you manage to find a few hours to kill, you spend half that time putting together a group and the other half raiding which only lets you kill 1 maybe 2 bosses. I have 4/7 with exp on Baleroc as well. I can not get into a pug to get further and starting a pug doesn't help. I have only managed to get that far by joining pugs that have already downed a couple of bosses and are desperate for someone extra who has half a brain. It's gotten so crazy on my server now that people require a rag kill before they will let you join either a 7/7 or even a stalled pug sitting at 6/7. 6/7 should be the requirement for a rag kill, not 7/7. If someone has been failing on rag up until now (for the week), that doesn't exactly make them a giant killer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but that is the issue at hand right there. That is why they are adding LFR. I guarentee it will be so easy that if you can get like a 10m raid group from your guild to go in you can hit LFR/normal in a night and get all the valor for a week. with 25 people and everything toned down, I truly expect LFR to be as easy as Wrath heroics. I'll say it, and you and quote me on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The majority of people don't have 4 hours four times a week that they can dedicate to playing WOW. The majority of wow players (casuals) are getting bored. Farming the same 2 dungeons to get valor to get a bit of extra gear. Pugs are not an option because pugs require 7/7. Guilds want commitment to raiding 2/3/4/5 times a week at a predefined time. A lot of people know how to gem/enchant but can't commit. It's those people that are keeping your precious game alive by funding patches. Not the 0.1% of elitists who feel that the content is too easy and is catering for &quot;casuals&quot;. Everyone comes here and complains about how easy the raids are when Blizzard nerf the content after a couple of months. Let me tell you a secret, you can't be that good if it takes you longer than that to complete the content when you are raiding 15 to 20 hours a week.<br />
<br />
If you really feel that you need a challenge then switch some of your gear for lower level items and try again. It will certainly be a lot tougher. The real truth is that the majority of people complaining either haven't done the content or don't like the idea of other people (who spend less time on wow than them) getting equivalent gear. Who cares if someone else has &quot;welfare epics&quot;. It's those &quot;welfare epics&quot; that are funding the new content every 4 months for you. How much content do you really think you would get with the 0.1% of players as the only funders?<br />
<br />
Sorry buddy, but how much you play is up to you, not others. You're the one choosing a guild that fits you.<br />
<br />
Saying that you need 4h/4d a week to do something in a wow raid is just a lame excuse ppl love to use. If you don't know how to play, you can sit on your &quot;raiding chair&quot; 24/7 and will still cry for Blizzard to nerf everything because you can't down a single boss.<br />
<br />
The only ones who raid all that time you say (or even more) are the ones fighting for server 1st. Most guilds do 2 or 3 days, 2h, 3h or 4h.<br />
<br />
Those players, disguising themselves as &quot;casuals&quot; (and making casuals look like &quot;bad players&quot; instead of just players that play less time) are the ones ruinning the game. Blizzard can't put something as a challenge (it's the same crap, just harder, no new content there) anymore because those players will scream that blizzard is denying them content (ilvl) they've paid for...<br />
<br />
Just one word defines this need for more from that kind of player: &quot;jeaulousy&quot;. As long as there is someone else in the world doing something that you're not able to do, you want it. Just like a spoiled kid.<br />
<br />
And there is no way to please that kind of player. Blizzard can just put every single drop/achievement mount from heroic into normal modes and just give a small &quot;.&quot; after the character name for whoever does the entire raid in heroic and those players will scream &quot;ME WANTZ THAT DOT! ME PAYID FOR ITZ, U DENYGN CONTETNZ FOR MAH SUBS BLIZZ! GIMMEEEEE!!!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Go scream at Sony, Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, etc. that you've payed for their games but can't be bothered (not even talking about laking of skill to do it) to finish it at the hardest dificult level, but want the whatever they give for completing it at that level. Yeah... they don't care. And since everyone alread know they don't care, they don't QQ at them. As soon as Blizzard showed that they cared a little, those players abused it.</div></div><hr />

If you don't wish to spend hours on learning how to play chess, then you have 9 other difficultylevels to choose from.

<br />
The problem with your argument is that if you don't have time to commit to two evenings a week to raid then you don't have any benefit at all of nerfing hardmodes to the point that it's not a challenge anymore for a lot of players who then have nothing to do for months and probably cancel their subs.<br />
<br />
Your situation also has nothing to with the casual players. You just bought a game without thinking twice and it was a mistake. It's not my fault or the fault of &quot;elitists&quot; that you don't even try to get into a pug, it's also not Blizzards fault. This game now exists for many years and it is pretty known what to expect from it. You could also think twice before buying an MMO. MMO's are known for spending a lot of time in them and this MMO is actually VERY casual compared to every other MMO.<br />
<br />
His argument is solid. If you don't have time or are not good enough to kill Ragnaros HC then you still have plenty to do. The &quot;elitists&quot; on the other side only have ONE BOSS to do and after that there is nothing left. So making this boss to be killable by the majority of the community a lot of people will be left with nothing to do, bored. Your situation is your problem. You chose for it and no one forced you to be bored unlike those people who will finish the game completely. They have no other choice than being bored because there is simply nothing left to do.<br />

<br />
I'd be willing to bet that the majority of guilds who are now clearing 6/7H do so on 2night a week schedules (or one night, now). My group did, progressing pre- and post-nerf. Firelands isn't a long instance, the only boss that takes the kind of investment you're talking about is Ragnaros on Heroic, and he's supposed to be for the people who want to raid for server firsts and wipe all night learning a fight.<br />

You should have a choice how you want to experience all the content, not be denied of it. Would be weird if you were reading a book, but would not get the final chapter unless you could prove you read all the previous chapters thoroughly. <br />
<br />
That's even the reason why lots of games have cheat modes, because developers realize that people need to be able to see all the stuff in the end, and not throw it in a corner because they hit a wall. If you're skilled enough to do it the hard way, bless you. But not every player has the same skills or even time to master the skills.<br />
<br />
Yeah, thats why WoW was better back in the &quot;day&quot;. Because if I wanted a catering service I would go to an all you can eat buffet.<br />
<br />
That being said, after trying to decipher any useful information from those graphs, I was unable too. There are too many variables that make concluding anything from them impossible.<br />
<br />
Apparently, 2600 random people have defeated Rag, from which I have no idea what country/servers. I have no idea how many people actually raid, is that 20% of the raiding community? Or is that closer to 90% of people who actually raid heroic? 180k or so have done normal firelands, is that 10% of the raiding community or 100%? Also is that all US or EU or Korea or China or what? Most people would conclude 135k is a mere 1.6% approx of the total people who play World of Warcraft and further conclude either - the content is too difficult (nerf it), that not many people raid ergo stop making raid content, or that the nerfs made to the content made too many people start to do it.<br />
<br />
Assuming the above not to be true and that the figure applies to the whole raiding community atleast, and that that whole raiding community is part of the whole of WoW where the statistics were gleaned... I have done a few calculations on the stats:<br />
<br />
Approximately between August 2nd, and August 30th, 6.357 characters per day were defeating heroic ragnaros. <br />
Approximately, between September 6th and September 27th, 66.810 characters per day were defeating heroic ragnaros.<br />
<br />
So regardless of how the numbers do not represent people in the slightest, IF (only IF) we conclude that in the month of September characters would have continued to defeat Ragnaros at 6.357 characters per day, in the month of September there was a 525% climb in the number of people defeating him (true figure is double it, 1050%, but we assume that the rate of climb has a rate of climb also - and that rate of climb = the rate of climb, essentially - that it is not a line graph and is actually quadratic so as to be a more realistic representation), if this is when the nerfs occured we could then hypothetically conclude with a good amount of logic that this was due to the nerfs.<br />
<br />
But because Characters do not represent people - and because there is no chart showing attempts, (therefore total amount of characters trying), I have to conclude there are only 2376 characters who wished to defeat hrag in the time of this graph. I've normalised this to 2600, because the number is obviously higher - as this only shows success, not fails. I took 2600 based on half of the gradient change (250% or 2.5), multiplied by the original gradient, 6.357, multiplied by 21 (a number for the figures observed in September) then just concluded that because the chart given to me was so shit and because it didn't show attempts that there was no actual point in doing anything mathematical/statistical, aslong as it was representative, and decided 2600 was representative enough and easy to work with...<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to get to, is what everyone is trying to get too ofc. Blizzard wants everyone to do content - and most seem to agree, they would all like to see content. Heroic Rag is not &quot;all content&quot; because it is tuned for a particular audience, but if people were completing it before hand why would Blizzard nerf it (it has to be so others could see it). Therefore, if 2600 people were the total amount of people who wanted to see it, and it continued at the rate of climb shown in August, it would take, (approximately), 1.12 years for all 2600 to see it. At the rate of climb experienced in September, it would take 39 days (approx), or about 1 month and 1 week.<br />
<br />
Is it justified, is it relative? How about the 135k, if we substitute that as the total number of raiders, and suggest they should all complete heroic rag, because it's now nerfed. Assuming the rate before the nerf, it would take 135000 raiders, 58 years to complete the content at the difficulty it was in August presuming they 1. All wanted to, 2. The figures represent how fast every raider could and would complete the content. After the nerf, it will now take them (assuming that the rate remains the same), 5.5 years. <br />
<br />
Let's say Blizz get's a cycle of 6 month's between patches (thats what they were aiming for if they were doing 3 patches for the expansion, no doubt - an 18month next expansion cycle). Because of the nerf it is an expectancy that while not all will complete it, there will be sufficient chance for them to do so... if they wanted to, could they do it? And in the 6 months, using the rate after the nerf... how many do complete it, and what percentage of the &quot;whole&quot; raiding community is that, and is that a fair representation of &quot;skill&quot; for the people that have completed it?<br />
<br />
Well at the rate, after 6 months (normalised to 180 days, 30 per month), 12026 characters at the nerfed rate would have completed heroic rag, which is 8.9% of the &quot;whole raiding community&quot; where the 135k is the whole raiding community. 8.9% would be the elite, downing the content, when it was elite content.<br />
<br />
Without the nerf, 1144 would have completed it or 0.85% of the raiding community. <br />
<br />
Assuming 135k is 135k of 11 million, those 12026 characters (after 6 months) could make their claim as 0.11% of everyone who plays the game, the 1144 characters 0.01% of everyone who plays the game.<br />
<br />
Should it be 0.10% of everyone who plays or 0.01% of everyone who plays that heroic content represents? Or more categorically, should it be 10% of everyone who raids, or just 1% of everyone who raids.<br />
<br />
Thats the only thing I could discern from the graphs, a stipulation of whether 10x as many people should be an accurate representation of those capable of doing heroic content.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps people who seem to judge the graph with no basis... because there is no basis.</div></div><hr />

I'll say it, and you and quote me on it.<br />
<br />
I do expect it to be a bit too easy but will do nicely for the majority of casuals. For me, I enjoy a challenge as much as the next guy. What I hope to get from LFR is some sort of achievement that will let me join pugs once I have completed it. It will also help people to learn the fights before doing more serious versions.<br />
<br />
My big problem with LFR is still the RNG component (I am very unlucky with rolling which is why 10 mans suit me more) and the need/greed will still be broken with 4.3 as a mage (DPS) could easily roll on a hit/agility trinket because it's classes as a DPS item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably a little bit more, but not hours and hours.<br />
<br />
Just because you're &quot;mindless beating your head in a wall&quot; doesn't mean you'll get a kill after X hours of wall beating. Only bad players think (and do that way) that if you stay there wiping without knowing what you're doing will magically (thanks to some unknow RNG event) down the boss at one time.<br />
<br />
That's actually how the &quot;best&quot; guilds get world 1st kills since they don't have &quot;how to&quot; guides to read/watch. All the rest alread get half work done reading guides/watching videos. Of course they will stay raiding for hours and days per week, they're competing with each other, so they can't just call the week and only get back to atempt it next week. Others are there trying to kill it 1st at the same time and most of them are getting payed to be the 1st one.<br />
<br />
So yes, ppl can clear the place that fast or just progress faster with fewer hours of play than someone else playing all the time.</div></div><hr />

If I were Blizzard, I would be concerned that only 5 percent of my player base was being successful at the main content that I am using most of my resources to develop, because the other 95 percent are more likely to get bored and quit subscribing. Whatever the reason for it, time or difficulty or boredom or whatever, I'd want to try to fix it.

<br />
That what gear do. As you get more drops from the bosses you can down, you'll &quot;nerf&quot; the next ones. If gear is not enough right now, in 6 months (or less), there will be a new tier with way more powerful gear that will make the actual easier.<br />
<br />
Life happens, if you can't spend more than 5 hours (it's not a flaw in wow design) and it takes longer for you to progress (but you still progress!), there is not much that can be done. It's a problem you have, not a problem of the game. They have a huge audience to please and can't just screw the game because someone lack skill or time to play. They alread created easy normal modes for that reason. If you want to step up and try heroics, you must know that it's not supposed to be a walk in the park. It's not their reason to exist.<br />
<br />
Raids are meant mostly for guilds, or not even guilds, but fixed groups. If your problem is pugging it, sorry, but the game can't be centered around that. They alread did it to be puggable at normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All guilds require some commitment in terms of a set time every weeks. Create a character and sign onto Auchindoun EU. Have a look at trade where they advertise guilds and tell me about a single guild that spends 1 day a week raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Saying that you need 4h/4d a week to do something in a wow raid is just a lame excuse ppl love to use. If you don't know how to play, you can sit on your &quot;raiding chair&quot; 24/7 and will still cry for Blizzard to nerf everything because you can't down a single boss.<br />
<br />
I can raid perfectly fine, thank you very much. I am not saying that blizzard should nerf everything in sight. I am saying that the present format is about the best they can do. Give it a month and nerf some more.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only ones who raid all that time you say (or even more) are the ones fighting for server 1st. Most guilds do 2 or 3 days, 2h, 3h or 4h.<br />
<br />
Guess again, sign onto my server and tell me the same story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those players, disguising themselves as &quot;casuals&quot; (and making casuals look like &quot;bad players&quot; instead of just players that play less time) are the ones ruinning the game.

<br />
People have been gearing up every week while working on their HC's until they eventually kill the next boss. Isn't that the same thing as nerfing the boss because other did it in the past with worse gear. Blizzard are just helping things along by nerfing the content<br />
<br />
<br />
Just one word defines this need for more from that kind of player: &quot;jeaulousy&quot;. As long as there is someone else in the world doing something that you're not able to do, you want it. Just like a spoiled kid.<br />
<br />
I am not jealous of anyone. I am saying that it's bullls..t that I should have to do the same 2 dungeons months on end. I will tell you what, you have an alternative, Blizzard can spend time creating 10 dungeons per patch for the casuals and then you can have your precious hard modes untouched. The problem is that you will only get one set of raids per year.<br />

End of story. If you can commit to raiding 5 days a week, 5 hours a day, you will clear the content and get geared quicker than someone who plays twice a week. End game only favours groups and groups require commitment in terms of time. Unfortunately, the majority of players have a life and are not able to pour hours and hours into the game.<br />
<br />
This is just not true. In TBC when I had been raiding for a couple of months (half a year or something) I had a guild that raided 4 to 5 evenings a week 4 hours a night. We sucked and couldn't even clear BT halfway even after SWP was released.<br />
In WotLK I raided with a guild that raided 3x3 hours a week. We got server first Anub 25 HC kill, we were doing good in ICC too untill we stopped.<br />
The point is that it's not only about how much you play. I bet with such a short raid as FL (only 7 bosses for 1 tier) guilds that progress only raid 2-3 evenings a week and guilds that cleared 7/7 will only need 2 hours a week.<br />
There are no reasons anymore to raid as much as we did in TBC only people who want first kills will raid extreme amounts the first weeks and after that only 2 hours a week. These guilds will probably be way more efficient than other guilds (less time played for the same results).</div></div><hr />

My group did, progressing pre- and post-nerf. Firelands isn't a long instance, the only boss that takes the kind of investment you're talking about is Ragnaros on Heroic, and he's supposed to be for the people who want to raid for server firsts and wipe all night learning a fight.<br />
<br />
It's about not standing in the fire, not raiding every night.<br />
<br />
Wonder how exactly that guy you quoted said that raiding 5 days instead of 2 gives more gear... 7/7 in 5 days or 2 will earn the same gear... go figure.<br />
<br />
Of course a 5 day 7/7 raid will get more gear than a 2 day 0/7, 1/7... one. The same way tons of 2 day 7/7 guilds gets more gear than some 5 day 1/7 ones...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the game is too hard, stop playing.. that needs to be blizzards stance... it was in vanilla/BC.. it should be today.<br />
<br />
Instead Wrath of the Mistake King came out, encouraged tons of baddies (OMG.. I NEVER DOWNED MC/KARA IN MY LIFE.. BUT NOW IM DOWNING THE LK!!!) to join the game/hang around... now that Cata was too hard and back to original wow style, people whine and blizzard complies.<br />
<br />
Solution: Keep them hard and people will get use to it.<br />
<br />
To be honest, there's nothing really wrong with giving out easy raid fights (Well there are some issues with it, I'm not going to bring them up here though... blizz has made clear what model they like), and anyone who struggled with karazhan in tbc would not have killed lich king before cata without some serious improvement.<br />
<br />
The problem is when they nerf the fights that are supposed to be hard. The people here talking about &quot;only 2.5k people have killed heroic rag, it's still too hard, nerfs didn't do anything&quot; are missing the point - it's SUPPOSED to be hard. Why don't you go look at how many more people have killed h rag now. Before the nerf to heroic rag (the hp reduction), 7 guilds in the US had killed heroic rag. 168 have now. Go ahead and tell me that they didn't completely neuter that fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because you're &quot;mindless beating your head in a wall&quot; doesn't mean you'll get a kill after X hours of wall beating. Only bad players think (and do that way) that if you stay there wiping without knowing what you're doing will magically (thanks to some unknow RNG event) down the boss at one time.<br />
<br />
That's actually how the &quot;best&quot; guilds get world 1st kills since they don't have &quot;how to&quot; guides to read/watch. All the rest alread get half work done reading guides/watching videos. Of course they will stay raiding for hours and days per week, they're competing with each other, so they can't just call the week and only get back to atempt it next week. Others are there trying to kill it 1st at the same time and most of them are getting payed to be the 1st one.<br />
<br />
So yes, ppl can clear the place that fast or just progress faster with fewer hours of play than someone else playing all the time.<br />
So the guild you are in didn't need 500 or so attempts to kill HC Ragnaros like Paragon. Wonder how this is possible.<br />
<br />
Not admitting that being a top raider IS very time consuming is something to take with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

The bolded part is wrong.<br />
<br />
That was everquest stance, and Blizzard killed him by giving easier content to the ones that considered Everquest too hard.<br />
<br />
If the game is too hard to the mayority of your playerbase, you MUST tone your game down and tell the elitists pricks that want the challenge of the game to be so high that most people fail to complete it to FUCK OFF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can raid perfectly fine, thank you very much. I am not saying that blizzard should nerf everything in sight. I am saying that the present format is about the best they can do. Give it a month and nerf some more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess again, sign onto my server and tell me the same story.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People have been gearing up every week while working on their HC's until they eventually kill the next boss. Isn't that the same thing as nerfing the boss because other did it in the past with worse gear. Blizzard are just helping things along by nerfing the content<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not jealous of anyone. I am saying that it's bullls..t that I should have to do the same 2 dungeons months on end. I will tell you what, you have an alternative, Blizzard can spend time creating 10 dungeons per patch for the casuals and then you can have your precious hard modes untouched. The problem is that you will only get one set of raids per year.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the end, you just signed for &quot;yes, I'm jealous&quot; when you say it's all &quot;bulls...&quot; and &quot;... Lots of pointless ranting cut ...&quot;.<br />
<br />
As someone else alread said, you just bought the wrong game, sorry. It's an online game, so nobody can have it perfectly fitting their needs.<br />
<br />
If your problem now is that you only have 2 heroics after 2 patches (wich is a valid point), there is nothing on it that puts raids on the same problem or as a solution for it.<br />
<br />
Actually, yes, raids are a solution for it, but only if you're able to &quot;not stand in the fire&quot;.<br />
<br />
Give it a month and just nerf the content? When it's suposed to last for 6? Why it bothers you to farm the same 2 heroics but not the same raid for 6 months? Grow up buddy. MMO's are not for you unfortunatelly. And not because of your time, but because you can't stand someone else being better.<br />
<br />
And no, you can't raid perfectly fine. And don't blame your server. Not happy with it, transfer. Let's nerf the entire US, EU, KR, etc. because your server &quot;sucks&quot;? No, thanks. Go to Blizzard guild forums, wow fansite forums, etc. look for one that fits your needs. Can't find and you're sure you're not the only one with that specific need? Create a guild yourself. Advertise it on forums, get ppl to know it exists.<br />
<br />
But you know what? Even that way, you'll probably still have problems, because you're not &quot;casual&quot;, you look like just a bad player that want everything others have because they can do it. So you'll probably not put up with a guild trying to progress if it doesn't mean you're not killing H-Rag next week.</div></div><hr />

Whats the point of having normal mode if everyone could run &quot;nerfed&quot; heroics? I for one am totally about removing normal and heroic, the game needs to go back to its roots - &gt; TBC. Hard grind, 4 different tiers at the same time, attunement grinds, armor grinds (shadow ress), and remove this nonsense called heroics. Make the bosses semi hard, every last boss should carry a &quot;key&quot; to unlock content for the next tier and be hard as hell.<br />
<br />
by all means.. go die. I raided all that bullshit in TBC, never again. You put attunements in, you had best look forward to rerunning all that old content every time you need a new member. You know, that content that you've ran 1 billion times.. well you're running it again, and again, and again instead of new content because you needed a replacement. <br />
<br />
Resistance grinds were just an artificial cock block. Sorry, we cannot progress because we don't have enough of the item that lets us make this, therefore we must spam run the trash and hope for drops.. I'm glad you have such fond memories of BC raiding, while i do think it was the best expansion, (ie the best fights) These two points however, are NOT their selling points.<br />
<br />
tl;dr.. die in a fire..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gray_Matter</div><div class="date">2011-10-13, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with your argument is that if you don't have time to commit to two evenings a week to raid then you don't have any benefit at all of nerfing hardmodes to the point that it's not a challenge anymore for a lot of players who then have nothing to do for months and probably cancel their subs.<br />
<br />
I actually think they hit the hard modes a bit heavy with the nerfs but the progress charts above seem to disagree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your situation also has nothing to with the casual players. You just bought a game without thinking twice and it was a mistake. It's not my fault or the fault of &quot;elitists&quot; that you don't even try to get into a pug, it's also not Blizzards fault. This game now exists for many years and it is pretty known what to expect from it. You could also think twice before buying an MMO. MMO's are known for spending a lot of time in them and this MMO is actually VERY casual compared to every other MMO.<br />
<br />
How the f..k do you know how hard I try to get into a pug? Are you on my server? Do you know how many pug leaders I have whispered or how many pugs I have started? Do you know how many f...g times I have run the 2 zand dungeons &quot;preparing&quot; for FL? You can speak from your perspective but you have no right to comment on what you think I have done.<br />
<br />
<br />
His argument is solid. If you don't have time or are not good enough to kill Ragnaros HC then you still have plenty to do. The &quot;elitists&quot; on the other side only have ONE BOSS to do and after that there is nothing left. So making this boss to be killable by the majority of the community a lot of people will be left with nothing to do, bored. Your situation is your problem. You chose for it and no one forced you to be bored unlike those people who will finish the game completely. They have no other choice than being bored because there is simply nothing left to do.<br />
<br />
Why can't they drop their trinkets and continue fighting without them post nerf? Would have the same effect of removing the nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd expect the number of people who've killed Rag w/o a nerf to be a ~linear curve, and that adding a nerf into the mix would dramatically increase the rate at which people killed him.<br />
<br />
Since the +nerf data is displaying what is expected from the -nerf data, I'd really like to see data of an entire tier of content that never gets nerfed (at least until it's obsolete).<br />
<br />
Am I alone on this one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably the same as before, because the &quot;content&quot; most claim they payed to see is &quot;current highest ilvl avaiable&quot;. So most players do not go back to finish stuff there.<br />
<br />
I have ppl in my raid group that unfortunatelly behaves just like that... a few weeks ago I mentioned going back to kill the heroic modes we didn't, finish the T11 drake achievements and those guys said &quot;why? nothing usefull there anymore&quot;... I mentioned the achievements and drakes and still got a &quot;LOL&quot; from them.<br />
<br />
They're not bad players at all, or we wouldn't be trying H-Rag right now (and more than 1/7h pre-nerf), but they're just as the bad players disguised as &quot;casuals that need nerfs&quot;, except that they're not bad, lol. They just want the purples. Fortunatelly for me, they're able to get.</div></div><hr />
