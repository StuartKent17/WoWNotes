No, this does not mean that Eye of Eternity or Naxxramas will have the same difficulty layout as the new upcoming Crusaders' Coliseum. The new format will only be applied to this particular tier of content.<br />
<br />
This is sort of a test run for this format, so we will be watching the situation very carefully to see how the reaction to the new raid modes lean. <br />
<br />
[...] More lockouts means more opportunities for gear upgrades and the ability for our development team to really make seamless and difficult encounters without having a gimmicky activation component. We can do that and still offer a very friendly environment to players who still want to move up in gear, but don't have the time to dedicate to the more extreme content.

&quot;Next Swing&quot; attacks<br />
[ Warrior Q&amp;A Quote ] Can I safely assume the same is true of Maul? <br />
Yes, and even Rune Strike to some extent.<br />
<br />
On next swing attacks to the job, but not in a particularly fun or elegant way. I'd love to promise to scrap them all, but we need to come up with an alternative that we really like first.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike and Maul might be fine in an environment where you used up most of your rage on your normal rotation and only needed to bleed off that excess rage in unusual circumstances, after a Hateful Strike for example. Given that we haven't been able to get there consistently so far, I'm not sure it's a good idea to pin our hopes on that solution however.

Feral Itemization<br />
We actually like the Feral solution and would love to implement something like that for Holy plate. We just haven't figured out a way to make it work yet. The Feral tree is designed to have some crossover between dps and tanking and some degree of being able to use the same gear for both cat and bear. If you could use &quot;rogue leather&quot; to also heal and do ranged dps, then it might be a problem. That's one of the risks in making paladins heal using dps plate. There are solutions of course, but we haven't liked any of them sufficiently well to pull the trigger.<br />
<br />
We can appreciate that not every Feral player is going to applaud the current implementation and some would prefer another solution, such as just having tanking leather again. We're not often going to come up with a solution for any class issue that is viewed as ideal by an overwhelming majority of people who play that class. We think it has worked out pretty well. I think Feral, bear and cat, is one of the success stories of LK in PvE. <br />
<br />
[...] Just to be clear, creating items isn't the problem. The problem is that when a boss has a loot list that offers specialized gear for every spec (and technically sub-spec in the bear case), it feels very RNG. Go beat on Emalon a little and pretend that was the only way possible to get that gear. I think you'd pull your hair out pretty quickly. <br />
<br />
Now maybe you meant give the itemization team some more work in the sense that we haven't come up with a solution yet that lets us drop say 20-30 types of armor off a boss without players getting really frustrated when theirs doesn't come up, without having the boss drop 10 items, or without converting the entire loot system to a token-turn in system. In that sense I'd agree with you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/18570233390-gc-says-feral-itemization-doesnt-work.html))<br />

Warlock Q&amp;A Follow-up<br />
We don't think curses need a massive rework. Probably the biggest problem is not many can compete with CoA.<br />
<br />
Demonology could stand a little more complexity to the rotation. It's the same problem BM hunters have, where if the rotation is simple and the pet doesn't have much to do, then you're bored, but if the rotation is complex and you get into a fight where you do have to manage the pet a lot, then you feel like you're getting pulled in multiple directions.<br />
<br />
As we hinted at in the QA, the demon design is still more or less pick one before the fight starts. We could see a model though where you swapped them in and out more often depending on changing conditions in the fight. Demonology could then be the best at that. However we also wanted to make sure Demo had the best pet, so it's hard to have the best pet on the one hand and also want to put it away often for an Imp or Felhunter.<br />
<br />
As with all the pure damage classes, it's relatively easy to mathematically prove who has the highest dps and the community tends to pick that spec, even if the difference is only a few percentage points. The best luck we've had is with making some specs better on some boss fights than others, but then people just tend to pick the spec who is better on most boss fights.<br />
<br />
It would be pretty easy to punch up numbers to where the Felguard does so much damage that Demo wins out over the other specs. That doesn't really solve the problem though. We can try to get it closer to the other specs, but then inevitably a set bonus or something will push things back towards inequality again. It's not at all an easy problem to solve, from a high-level design POV. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18696991923-warlock-qa-followup.html))</div></div><hr />

Easy fix, kinda.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make Demo pets stronger then the other specs, in a way that they do more damage when demo spec. Will still work out very well because i would put the talent so far down destro or affliction cant reach it.<br />
<br />
<br />
But i like the idea of swapping pets. could give some very cool moves in pvp that would end out giving some awesome pvp movies and pve survival/utility options that havent been seen from us warlocks, yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes much more sense to convert Mail healing gear into Plate healing gear through some blacksmithing sorcery...<br />
<br />
Leather spellpower classes: 1<br />
Mail spellpower classes: 1<br />
Plate DPS classes: 3<br />
<br />
<br />
And i don't mean all plate healing gear gets removed so Paladins can only roll on Mail healing, i mean you just cut the Plate healing in instances by about half or 2/3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also they could do the same with Leather (which is also often disenchanted), having it able to be &quot;upgraded&quot; to mail through Leatherworking. Obviously having a slight stat change in the process (spirit-&gt;mp5)</div></div><hr />

That's what i meant. Leather piece drops and it gets converted (through Leatherworking) into Mail gear with possibly a slight stat change (spirit -&gt; Mp5?). Mail piece drops and it gets converted (through blacksmithing) into plate gear with possibly a slight stat change (mp5 -&gt; crit?).<br />

Obviously an item can only be upgraded once or else Paladins would be the new hunters :D</div></div><hr />

The major downside to the sunwell system was; sunmotes were thin on the ground. The core works of the system were great, plate dps legs drop, can be converted into tanking legs and/or healing legs of plate through 1 sunmote. So far its been the only instance where this system was put into effect, and by doing so they didnt have so much RNG working against getting great drops. And with the removal of the BoP profession quirks something like this would really work wonders; especially for those few classes/combinations for which a certain item needs to be tailored. 2h Tanking weapon anyone? Feral/Healing Idols, Sigils, Librams, Shields (heal/tank/offensive caster).<br />
<br />
Perhaps they should do it where it uses 1 runed orb (18 emblems through heroics is not too much to ask i'd say) or 5 frozen orbs or a process where an alchemist transforms a combination of materials into the changable currency object. Any other profession would result in making the item BoE (or else you'd have to be a blacksmith/LW to make the changeover, making the profession too dependable again).</div></div><hr />

It wasn't a bad system in being able to trade in items, but it made it very untransparent which items you'd be able to get. People didn't know they could get an item for something that dropped, and ended up rolling on stuff that was absolutely no use to them at all.<br />

You know? Team spirit? Hhelping your guild as they help you? The challenge to kill a boss? We usually have nice 10 mans running, starting with ZA where everybody helped the other to get a bear mount - and not bugger off after you won one. <br />

DKP is fail. If you think team spirit and guild progress is so important, why not just distribute the items to the raiders who need them the most?<br />
<br />
The only thing you achieve with DKP is making the rich richer, as when you participate a lot, you obviously get more points which equals more gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
So people who don't participate often should get loot? I would think that from a fairness standpoint as well as a progression standpoint, people who are reliable and show up to raids often should be geared over people who randomly decide to raid once a month.<br />
<br />
I do agree that DKP is fail though. Loot council is the best as long as you have a mature one-minded guild, which I'm sure is few and far between.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because for one people would play favorites (or some could argue that) if you set up any type of loot council. Not to mention dkp for our guild is only given out based on how much you raided that night, and if you're wait listed you still get some dkp. Saying you're making the rich richer? You're only letting people bid and win their gear to those who've shown up time after time and saved it up. <br />
<br />
It's not the perfect loot system and may not be right for you but it's been used since vanilla wow, somehow I dont think that if is fail it would still be used by alot of Raiding guilds. DKP is a system used that is unbiased (unless you somehow pissed off the raid leader somehow, and if that posses a problem, just find another guild) system. We even carry our dkp from tier 7 to 8 and 9 to reward those who showed and and possibly didn't need the gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How often have you run the same instance for months and never seen that item despite killing the boss every week, then watching that baddie who gets carried from another guild get it on his first downing. Well here is a solution without having to drastically change holy plate or anything else. <br />
<br />
Make all loot buyable by badges. BUT make the items only buyable after you have been part of a raid group that downed the boss you want to buy loot from. This way, you don't get RNGed week after week for gear you earned yet it keeps baddies from getting the loot because they actually have to be part of a group who has done it. I think this is a nice compromise, gives gear people deserve without letting baddies have it, not to mention gives you something to spend conq badges on.</div></div><hr />

I think too many people focus on that last 1% DPS instead of just having fun playing a spec they think is fun to play. Too many people take the word of WoW mathematicians over their own gut feeling on what it fun to play and really it's all over a very minor chunk of DPS...usually.<br />
<br />
Damage/Healing meters are a big reason for this type of behavior. I remember when those weren't there. It was just a bunch of people playing what they loved and trying their best.<br />
<br />
Now it's a bunch of robot sheep following math nerds using cookie cutter builds and pressing buttons on a schedule instead of using, for lack of a better term, their &quot;gut&quot; on when and where to use their abilities.<br />
<br />
I hate meters!<br />
<br />
But at the same time, they are a very useful tool for weeding out / fixing problems. It's just that too many people take the meters at face value as the end all be all of everything instead of looking deeper into the situation.<br />
<br />
Kinda ranted at the end there, just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alemayehu</div><div class="date">2009-07-26, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the people that comment about Arena: I feel that in 5's and 3's though some setups are better than others, with the newer talents its not as unbalanced as 2's. So the fact that they made the best rewards available through 3's and 5's will mean that 2's will still go down, but it won't make certain classes/setups feel so trivial.<br />
<br />
To glowwrym, if dps is within a few % of each other (lets say its the same person who plays demonlogy/affliction/destro, has experience and glyphs) then yeah I feel play the best one. But if a certain spec underperforms consistently, even when players swap out gear here and there, glyphs, and have the proper raid debuffs, something should be done. For example, I beat a lot of dps'ers because I'm damn good with my warlock, know what buttons to press, when to move, when to use my wild magic pot, etc. However if 2 skilled mages were fighting say mirmiron, there is no way the frost mage would outdps the Fire TTW mage. Not because the frost one doesn't know how to use a mana gem or move or something, its just the way he is specced.<br />
<br />
For example, the fact that hunters as bm do a lot less damage than survival...just doesn't seem to make sense considering hunters are a pure dps class. I get the same feeling for my warlock. If I skip all of the PvP talents, then all 3 specs should do quite well. I do know some need haste more than others (affliction comes to mind) but if I am doing say 4.5k dps as demonlogy and 6.1k as destruction (with all naxx gear besides a 10 man uld ring) then something is wrong.</div></div><hr />
