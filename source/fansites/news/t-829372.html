Because the game is much better with a bunch of &quot;make everything hard&quot; crowd, while they pull a Cuties Only stunt and exploit bugs in encounters to make a hard encounter, easier.

Essentially, Frostbolt and Ice Lance are going to do the exact same damage. All other frost damage has been nerfed by 15% on frozen targets(you know, the only targets frost mages have). And Deep Freeze by an additional 20% on top of that. Sure, it may not be perfect and Ice Lance will still hit like a truck but they did NOT buff frost.<br />

You can't call ICC even without 30% buff hard without seeing old tbc ,vanilla content.It was stated clearly cata will seperate the bad players that wotlk produced from the one that have a will to learn how to play.And here we go,we wipe on first trash group because never heard about cc only used to smashing the aoe key.Than we go to the forums complain how hard are HC's and not fun cause apparently we don't know how to play our class...Well blizzard are starting again to make bad decisions one step ahead two back...</div></div><hr />

Whenever there were weak trash packs with no main elite target, I never even bothered since usually my target dies from other players' AoEs and I have to re-target something, which will most likely die too, meaning I can never get a good long cast going. They even buffed Mind Sear, which was definitely weak.<br />

Overall, I really like the priest buffs and nerfs. The buffs should easily cancel out the nerfs.</div></div><hr />

You people complain that WOTLK was to easy, yet you used exploits throughout the entire expansion to make stuff easier. You also never challenged yourselves, like you always claimed you wanted, and removed the 30% ICC buff. You're all a bunch of hypocrites.<br />
<br />
You sir, are a retard :)<br />
<br />
What's the point of playing a game or achieving anything in a game when it is so easy to achiev? Yes there where a few very hard fights in WOTLK, such as LK25HC, I myself got it with 15% buff after which I quit playing, seeing as I basically was done with that expansion, got everything else down with 0-5% buff.<br />
<br />
It's taken me/my guild longer to progress through all the 10man content that exists in Cata (normal modes) than it took for me and my guild to progress through icc25normal+heroic combined (the amount of time put in to the progression, considering that you had to wait for each wing to open in ICC), and we still haven't even downed nefarian 10 normal, 1.7% though without a hunter, our hunter is back from vacation now though so might be able to down him now, but still, Cata is way more fun to play because downing a new boss puts a smile on my fucking face compared to in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
And to the heroic instances... It's supposed to be fucking hard, and you're supposed to struggle to get through them, wotlk heroics was just run through even in the first content patch in full blue gear (with pugs), with pugs now you have to coordinate some kind of CC, unless the people in your group are good geared (by good geared I mean ~ilvl 350)<br />
and ofc guildruns where you can just run through it.<br />
<br />
Heroics are like they where in TBC, even in epic gear there was somewhat of a struggle to complete some heroics.<br />

It's actually a good thing that they removed mend rotten flesh imo, seeing as you have to have atleast 2 people who have the ability to interrupt to be able to kill him, first interrupt the aoe heal thingie, but then he can cast mend rotten flesh straight after so basically they made the fight possible for all group setups.</div></div><hr />

By the way you call heroics now hard im assuming you couldnt even kill marrowgar on normal with the 30% buff, we arent hypocrites, let me make a difficulty platform for you, wrath style i wont use the other expansions because you wont know what im talking about, i will include cata heroics not the raids because you probably are to busy complaining that the heroics are to hard to pay attention to any of them. Mind Numbingly Easy being the easiest and Insanity being the hardest, also if you think Cata heroics take<br />
<br />
Mind Numbingly Easy - Wrath Heroics, VoA<br />
Super Easy - ToC<br />
Casual - Naxxramas, Obisidian Sanctum with no drakes up<br />
Easy - ICC normal with 20%-30% buff, Obsidian Sanctum 1 Drake Up, Onyxia's Lair<br />
Normal - ICC normal with 0%-15% buff, Obsidian Sanctum 2 Drakes Up, Malygos, 8/12 ICC heroic with 20%-30% buff, Cataclysm Heroics<br />
Difficult - ICC heroic with 20%-30% buff 11/12, ICC heroic with 0%-15% buff 8/12, Ulduar Normals, ToC Heroic, Ruby Sanctum<br />
Veteran - ICC heroic 11/12 with 0%-15% buff, ICC heroic 12/12 with 20%-30% buff, Obsididan Sanctum 3 Drakes Up, Ruby Sanctum Heroic, Ulduar Hardmodes excluding keepers yogg and algalon<br />
Hardcore - All Ulduar Hardmodes excluding Mimiron and Yogg 0 keepers up, Heroic Lich King 10%-15% buff<br />
Insanity - Yogg 0 pre-nerf, Firefighter, Heroic Lich King no buff<br />
<br />
Basing on the fact you think cataclysm dungeons are way to hard, i believe you belong in a special group of players who like to play on the Mind Numbingly Easy category and has a maximum potential until they learn to play of Super Easy.<br />
<br />
We arent hypocrites sure most of us haven't beat lich king heroic no buffs in wrath, but we were tired of being stuck with playing the mind numbingly easy difficulty every single day if we wanted our emblems, a lot of us would like to play on at least a semi-challenging difficulty for heroics, in my opinion all players with a brain should be able to do cataclysm heroics im a healer and i dont think they are hard, i find them at an average difficulty and im fine with that, because it keeps players like you out of higher difficulties because you cant function yet at them, and lets players who have a working brain try say the Difficult category and work up depending on their skill and dedication.</div></div><hr />

Stopped there, because the rest is just the bitching of an elitist trying to prove himself. The person you quoted is correct. If something is too easy make it harder for yourself, don't force your gaming style on normal people who like it the way it was. Games come with difficulty settings, hard to do in a MMO, but some people like things on very easy, easy and or normal, not Hard, Extras hard and OH SHIT! All the time.<br />
<br />
You have something to prove by playing a game fine, have fun that is how you want to play, but others do not want to play that way and should not be forced too just so you can have your fun. If its nerfed to be easier use the brain you were born with and find a way for you and your group to make it HARDER. Drop down a level in gear, pull extra mobs, stand in stuff or something. To call another person retard just because he might enjoy things easier is only showing who the real &quot;retard&quot; is, not to mention make you extremely rude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you want it super easy, I'll say as other said, run normal instances, because it's supposed to be hard to get loot, not like in WOTLK where it was like a new epic everytime you logged on.<br />
<br />
If something is too easy for me or anyone I know (in heroics), they try to make it harder, by i.e completing the achievments, not ccing, pulling extra packs for the sake of the healer having to actuall heal (which is me most of the time).<br />
<br />
So once again, if you want it easy, go run normals untill you are good enough / have the time to actually put an effort in to completing something, you guys are acting like it's the end of the fucking world because you have to CC some trash in an heroic, god... There's a reason mages have polymorph, rogues have sap, druids have hybernate, hunters have traps, warlocks have fears, it's not only for the pvp, these spells have been in the game from day one (dno bout hybernate but the rest atleast) unlike pvp which didn't come untill several major patches in to vanilla, so what do you, sir, think they used those spells for before PvP came along? It sure as hell wasn't to make the content harder.<br />
<br />
I rest my case.</div></div><hr />

Im not saying it will be back to wrath style easy, that was my argument to him basically saying there are different levels of difficulty, most of these are balance changes a couple actual nerfs, but please actual see the chain of arguments with this guy to understand why i posted that, i did not post that because of the nerfs, i posted it because he was being a retard saying, we cant say wrath heroics were to easy because we didnt do lich king heroic with no buff.</div></div><hr />

A lot of changes for convenience of group make up 'cause it's not fair to vote kick someone just 'cause they don't offer what you need for CC/Interrupts.

Why don't you like these changes? If you want a challenge then start raiding, and if you give me the old excuse of &quot;I just want to do 5 mans and not 10-25&quot; then quit WoW, you won't get the challenge you are seeking for in 5 mans.<br />
<br />
It seems like people are just trying to find reasons to hate on Blizzard, there are a lot of heroic buffs as well, so please stop finding excuses to flame Blizzard and actually try to give a decent comment, or at least read the comments, most of the comments are about Blizzard bending over to these so called &quot;Wrath babies&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blackrock Caverns<br />
<br />
Beauty now spawns with only two pups in Heroic difficulty. Not to worry though, the missing pup has been adopted by a wonderful, if not insane family.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grim Batol<br />
<br />
Faceless Corruptors now move 10% more slowly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowfang Keep<br />
<br />
Baron Ashbury<br />
<br />
Sadly, in his hubris he has forgotten how to Mend Rotten Flesh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Stonecore<br />
<br />
Stonecore Earthshapers' Dust Storm does slightly less damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throne of the Tides<br />
<br />
The damage done by Lady Naz'jatar's Shock Blast and Naz'jar Tempest Witch Chain Lightning has been reduced.<br />
Tainted Sentries Swell damage has been reduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs and nerfs aside, these changes in particular confuses me. All of these abilities and damage can been completely avoided with use of interrupts and crowd control. So Im getting confused when Blizzard states that zerging dungeon content is for normal mode only, and meanwhile they apply these changes for heroic dungeons. Because this is a step towards zerging, and thus a step back to WOTLK.</div></div><hr />

Some of the heroics like Ahn'kahet and others were on par with many of the cataclysm heroics. I've had some really bad pugs when I've had the misfortune of pugging and we've still managed to clear the heroic. (I can't even remember other bosses that were hard because its been more then half a year) The real diffrences between the two expansions is how long it takes to get geared. They made epic craftables a lot harder to make and removed epics from end bosses as well as making entry level items (333) harder to get. As a whole the heroics are harder but not by the huge margin everyone talks about.</div></div><hr />

This is why I call you hypocrites.<br />
<br />
I really doubt that many guilds use exploits to make cata encounters easier, I myself / guilds I've been in have never used any kind of exploit to down a boss easier.<br />
So really taking everyone whom you call elite/elitist and saying that they use exploits on fights that are to difficult, is fucking mindblowing.<br />
<br />
I'm actually wondering if you are serious in anything you say or if you're just trolling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the point of playing a game or achieving anything in a game when it is so easy to achiev? Yes there where a few very hard fights in WOTLK, such as LK25HC, I myself got it with 15% buff after which I quit playing, seeing as I basically was done with that expansion, got everything else down with 0-5% buff.<br />
<br />
It's taken me/my guild longer to progress through all the 10man content that exists in Cata (normal modes) than it took for me and my guild to progress through icc25normal+heroic combined (the amount of time put in to the progression, considering that you had to wait for each wing to open in ICC), and we still haven't even downed nefarian 10 normal, 1.7% though without a hunter, our hunter is back from vacation now though so might be able to down him now, but still, Cata is way more fun to play because downing a new boss puts a smile on my fucking face compared to in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
And to the heroic instances... It's supposed to be fucking hard, and you're supposed to struggle to get through them, wotlk heroics was just run through even in the first content patch in full blue gear (with pugs), with pugs now you have to coordinate some kind of CC, unless the people in your group are good geared (by good geared I mean ~ilvl 350)<br />
and ofc guildruns where you can just run through it.<br />
<br />
Heroics are like they where in TBC, even in epic gear there was somewhat of a struggle to complete some heroics.<br />
<br />
<br />
inb4 tl;dr, smyls etc.<br />
<br />
========<br />
<br />
So its taken you 4-5 months or so to progress through 10 man shit because that is the amount of time from icc release to somewhere in the 15 percent buff. Way to prove you are just full of shit.</div></div><hr />

Really seems like they nerfed every encounter that a decent pug could wipe on and removed every mandatory interupt, as well as nerfed and made more apparent every avoidable aoe...Once this patch goes live i would say the difference of heroics in wrath in full 200 blues and now in full 346 is gonna start to be close.

<br />
Wrong answer there dude. Being prepared for a fight does not make you a loser, heroics are practice for raiding, if they are too hard for you, then stick to normals. <br />
<br />
It isn't about feeling superior, it is about wanting a challenge, and fearing the wow devs giving in and the game going back to the atrocity that was wraith. It isn't elitist at all, people want a challenge, and that is how people learn. You should want to elevate yourself to be better than the game, not have the game brought down to your level. <br />
<br />
That is fine if you can't master content within the first month, there is nothing wrong with that... you will learn in time though, and you will feel a sense of accomplishment. That is why we play games, for a challenge. <br />
<br />
If the game is that unimportant to you, why do you want/need to even do heroics? Obviously it is important to you that you be able to do heroics...?</div></div><hr />

I will hold judgement until I see the changes first hand. I never thought SFK needed any changes. But I only run heroics with guild members so I don't have any LFG horror stories. <br />
<br />
I do like the Cata changes though. My favourite so far is no free epics! Epic items should be hard to get they are after all &quot;epic&quot; <br />
<br />
Wrath content was easy, that is a know fact. But how many people downed LK in reg or heroic, the fact is most players don't have access to end game content because you cannot be carried through it. In cataclysm this is the case with heroics now, everyone must know there class and be able to pull there own weight for the group to be successful. No free rides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was with you till you got the part about QQing they made aoes more apparent. Really?? Do you think hard is the equivalent of punishing people with bad eye sight? That isn't hard, that is stupid design. There is a HUGE difference there. If you can't see that (yes I went there) then you are just trolling. <br />
<br />
Punishing users just because they can't see aoes well is just stupid. Some people actually used an addon for that, that same addon was later used to make encounters in ICC trivial I guess, but still. Some people needed that to help them avoid aoes. They want to avoid them, they are aware of the mechanics, they simply have poor eye sight/partial color blindness etc. Maybe you don't, but others do. So please try thinking before you speak. <br />
<br />
I think a really good one is the one in ToT. Yet a friend of mine with partial color blindness has lots of trouble seeing it. I tell him on vent, he moves. Still there is no reason to punish him just because he has trouble with certain colors. <br />
<br />
As for interrupts, I agree. If you agree with that though, then you should agree they need to give every class an interrupt. One that every spec can take. They also need to make sure every spec has access to CC that can be used on both humanoids, and beasts. IF they did that then they should keep interrupts a very big part of encounter design. They won't though, so these changes are needed. <br />
<br />
The people on here going &quot;they said cata heroics would be different, and hard&quot; yes they did. You are forgetting one of their main design philosophies for cata though, &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot;. With some of their encounter designs some classes just don't have a place. They really only had two choices. Change some encounters, or add the interrupt/cc for every spec. They went with the first. It isn't the choice I would have made, but there it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
omg<br />

<br />
Completely agree with you. Is there any reason NOT to roll mage for dps now? Is there anything that another class brings to the table that they can't cover? <br />
<br />
CC- mages have a ton<br />
slowing- lol<br />
spellstealing/dispelling - yep they have it<br />
interrupt- again lol <br />
aoe damage - see above<br />
single target burst - oh hell yeah<br />
aoe cc- again they are one of the very few classes who have this<br />
mobility - any spec can go into arcane for the blink speed boost, oh and BLINK period<br />
<br />
There really is almost no reason to bring any other class for dps. With my guild group the other night we ran with 3 mage dps. It was by far the smoothest run ever. 3 ccs, 3 interrupt/silences etc. <br />
<br />
GF plaid her lock since vanilla, recently I got her to try out mage. She's fire ms, frost os. She was shocked by how much damage she could do in a pvp spec. She loves her lock, but she's going to be staying with the mage. There just is no reason not to, especially since all of the lock nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And anyone thinking Heroics are hard and that people that can't beat them are just bad players, I dare you to play Castlevania: Lords of Shadow on Paladin mode. Y'all need to learn what a hard game really is.<br />
<br />
That's the HUGE difference between solo games and group games.<br />
On a solo game, you can play in whatever difficulty and pace you want. Your mistakes and &quot;wipes&quot; there are just your only responsibility. You completely depend on your own skill.<br />
<br />
In group games, however, the better players always to some extent carry the worst players of the group. So if a complete retard sneaks in your LFD heroic group, the other players do have to suffer for his often completely idiotic mistakes. And you are being elitist for even daring to point out his whatever critical mistake he did third time in a row.<br />
I know that &quot;do a guild run&quot; or &quot;do with skilled friends&quot; is a solution, but the point still remains.</div></div><hr />

I've a little question about 5 men changes : What is Blizzard doing on Cataclysm ?<br />
<br />
Are Blizzard devs kidding us ? &quot;Cataclysm dungeons gonna be really challenging and you'll need to play well !&quot;<br />
<br />
=&gt; &quot;5 men changes ! We're nerfing 5 men dungeons for newbs !&quot;<br />
<br />
-_- Seriously, devs are totally ridiculous ! When WotLK was released, it was clear that dungeons, and raids, 'gonna be really easy, but now for Cataclysm, Blizzard's announce some awesome dungeons, and then nerf them...</div></div><hr />

At intended ilvl gear (333) for Heroic, you have absolutely NO chance with Beauty if you cant CC all 3 puppies. Same as interrupt nerf on Baron, you would have trouble if your group consists of apally tank and 3 ranged, which also means requeue is your only choice. Grim Batol nerfs may indicate its harder than the rest of H and needs to be toned down to be less dreadful to your averag PUGs. And you conveniently forget HoO, VP buffs :\</div></div><hr />

The person you quoted is correct. If something is too easy make it harder for yourself, don't force your gaming style on normal people who like it the way it was. Games come with difficulty settings, hard to do in a MMO, but some people like things on very easy, easy and or normal, not Hard, Extras hard and OH SHIT! All the time.<br />
<br />
You have something to prove by playing a game fine, have fun that is how you want to play, but others do not want to play that way and should not be forced too just so you can have your fun. If its nerfed to be easier use the brain you were born with and find a way for you and your group to make it HARDER. Drop down a level in gear, pull extra mobs, stand in stuff or something. To call another person retard just because he might enjoy things easier is only showing who the real &quot;retard&quot; is, not to mention make you extremely rude.<br />

Thats not really the point. Being in a queue for 40 mins, only to get SFK and the whole group falls apart on Ashbury after 1 wipe.

Sure, you can't force your gamestyle on other players, but to get improved loot, you can't be just casual. Extra effort should equal rewards. Heroics are SUPPOSED to be a lot tougher than normal dungeons, so why nerf that heroic part of them? If people can't do it, well, don't let them. If they don't have the IQ or haven't prepared enough beforehand, by reading tactics or so, they don't deserve that phat lewt. Not until they learn how to play properly.</div></div><hr />

If you are dreaming of difficult heroics that ship has already sailed. The cata launch heroics are not - and never again will be - difficult. Much of the initial difficulty was artificially created by healers coming to grips with the healing changes. Once healers generally realised that they didn't need to keep people (not even the tank) topped up and that brought their mana usage under control the difficulty fell off very substantially. Similarly tanks (and DPSers) had to become much more proactive with their defensive cooldowns. <br />
<br />
What does puzzle me though is the statement that they want the heroics to remain equally difficult when so many of the encounters are designed with making their diffficulty obsolete in mind. Look for example at most of the one shot mechanics, they mostly do 120-150k damage which very soon won't be one shotting people at all. It can't be accidental that many of those effects do an amount of damage that is only marginally higher than the health people have already. Once most people have enough health to survive those hits those encounters will become incredibly easy.<br />
<br />
I put in a post a long while back:<br />
<br />
<br />
There are an awful lot of things that add to the percieved difficulty of an unfamiliar instance.<br />
<br />
You don't know which enemy spells can be ignored and which need to be interrupted so the dangerous ones do a lot of damage.<br />
You don't know which mobs will run to the tank and which ones will stand still and cast meaning there will be a tendency for the tank to leave one stray ranged mob when once he knows the instance he will pick it up immediately.<br />
You don't know which mobs spawn adds so the tank will often not have an AoE ability ready to pick them up when they appear.<br />
You don't know which mobs heal / dispel / fear / cc people / randomly target etc meaning any that do tend to be very effective.<br />
You don't know what the patrol routes are so you tend to aggro adds a lot more than you will in a familiar instance.<br />
You don't know what the boss abilities are so you will wipe a lot on things that should be avoided / interrupted / otherwise prevented.<br />
The healers don't know the damage profile of the fights, they dont know which are the high damage parts and which are low damage parts, if they guess low when its high the tank dies, if they guess high when its low the healer goes oom.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this is already resolved. With it, most of the difficulty is already gone and never coming back. Every day, from now on, the cata heroics will be easier than they were the day before. Railing against this is a waste of time. Even if you wanted to you couldn't do heroics as hard as they were in the first week of launch, peoples knowledge of the fights is what is trivialising them and that is as it should be. In the short time since launch week the average length of my PUG heroics has dropped from 2-3 hours each to under an hour each. This means they are already about half to one third of the difficulty they were to begin with and all due to people having better gear and knowing the fights and that is in just over a month! To even think that slight changes to the mechanics of a few of the bosses will come anywhere close to matching the huge trivialisation effect of gear and knowledge should be considered a sign of insanity as it misses the truth of the matter by such a wide margin that no rational person could justify the notion.</div></div><hr />

Some of the trash nerfs I see as unnecessary. Groups doing it as intended were not having trouble on any trash packs I don't think. However things like the visuals change for Ozruk and Corborus are pretty smart. The dive timer increase is lame though I must say. A lot of changes for convenience of group make up 'cause it's not fair to vote kick someone just 'cause they don't offer what you need for CC/Interrupts. Got lucky enough to have a shaman myself (moonkin) and hunter for Beauty the other day, no clue how we coulda succeeded without that make up. So yeah some are for more convenience and less vote kicks. Unfortunately there are some straight up nerfs that are... well... sad.<br />
<br />
<br />
It isnt to hard to be honest. most classes have a form of cc.<br />
Hex,polymorph,hex, trap, root , fear, repentance even<br />
<br />
Most of the time (me being a Surv hunter) take the job to perm cc 2 of the mobs its easy as hell. Only the pull is tricky but after that no problem at all.<br />
<br />
only having 1 cc in the group is pretty rare. TBH up till now I never been in a group as the sole CC there was always a second one either a shaman, mage, druid, rogue, paladin or warlock.<br />
<br />
I really cannot believe people had so much trouble keeping 2 adds either perm cced or temp cced.<br />
<br />
for interrupts I can understand since not all classes/specs have that, but cc should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
At intended ilvl gear (333) for Heroic, you have absolutely NO chance with Beauty if you cant CC all 3 puppies. <br />
That not true personal I did Beauty a couple of times at that gear level (both pug and guildgroup) and we did fine who says you need to cc all tree of them Just cc 2 and burst down the third one simple as that. you can even decide to kill a second puppy as well so you only need to cc one. :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-01-12, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't understand why most of you are complaining about the heroic nerfs, most of the people are getting bored from the heroics and just want to get their valor points quickly, these changes are understandable and well put.<br />
Why don't you like these changes? If you want a challenge then start raiding, and if you give me the old excuse of &quot;I just want to do 5 mans and not 10-25&quot; then quit WoW, you won't get the challenge you are seeking for in 5 mans.<br />
<br />
It seems like people are just trying to find reasons to hate on Blizzard, there are a lot of heroic buffs as well, so please stop finding excuses to flame Blizzard and actually try to give a decent comment, or at least read the comments, most of the comments are about Blizzard bending over to these so called &quot;Wrath babies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Because, unfortunately, Blizzard said that the game would nerf itself when the players started collecting better gear (346+), wich they call &quot;outgearing the dungeon&quot;. That would be by players who raid and get geared in 359, players who get craftable 359 gear and faction 359 gear (exalted) and, after the first patch (4.1) the gear from new heroics (in this case, for ppl that don't give a **** about raiding, buying gear or even pvp).<br />
<br />
With one month, the player base isn't exactly outgearing the dungeons alread and instead of waiting for that happening, Blizzard started to nerf heroics. And no, it's not about this batch of nerfs, but the ones ppl alread forgot that happened in prior hotfixes. And remember: buffing a little, something that isn't exactly dangerous today (Like Ptah) doesn't make it equal to a Ashbury nerf for example. We didn't take too long to go back to aoe festival in many pulls and even don't care if the tank is about to die or died and the dpsers are tanking (normally dps warriors, dks, paladins or rangeds that can kite forever without exactly overgear the heroic in question). Even some bosses a dps could tank (I did alread bosses like the 1st one in Lost City, thx WotLK tanks who join my random and don't move out of stuff because the healer &quot;should keep everyone topped 100% of the time&quot;) depending on their remaining health.<br />
<br />
Since they started to nerf dungeons, could be a sad coincidence brougth by the end of holidays, but I noticed a increase in WotLK style Tank/Healers showing up in LFD. Lost a good amount of my time saturday with 2 tanks in a heroic because they just wanted to go WotLK style without even outgear the damn place. Just target, charge and start spamming their aoe tanking abilities thinking that the 5/6 mob trash (with mobs that will kill you with their spells combined or fast cast aoe spells) could be easily brought down and healed through it, the 1st one only lasted enough for the 1st boss, when he tought that the healer sucked for not beeing able to heal his ass out so he could just stand into the bombs without moving. The second one didn't last for one pull after charging the said trash pack and getting obliterated a few seconds later and calling us &quot;idiots&quot; for something that looks like we missed in those 3, 4 or 5 seconds he lived.<br />
<br />
In the end, the &quot;most of the people are getting bored from the heroics and just want to get their valor points quickly&quot; is a excuse only valid after said heroics aren't part of the main content anymore. Right now, &quot;most of the people&quot; are still doing it for the gear + valor (and even rep for more gear from factions). The easier you make it to ppl to get away with lower than intended gear, the more you'll have to nerf after. You make ppl think it's easy without exactly having a gear on par for it to be easy and they'll think it's time to do raids. They'll get there and &quot;hey, this dificult is not in line with what I saw from heroics, bring it down to be a step over heroics like you guys said it would be! Not this huge stupid gap! You guys suck and don't know how to design a damn game!&quot;. And Blizzard will be left with only 2 options: <br />
<br />
1) Don't listen and watch those players leaving the game before they &quot;should&quot; since it will still take a few months before the next content patch with the new raid and probably 1 or 2 new heroics that will give new high level gear, wich in turn make some stuff easy on older raids;<br />
2) Start nerfing the raids so they keep playing since the intended dificult content for them was burned quickly with nerfs (and they will probably not care about going back to BoT, BWD and ToFW to beat that content because most of them just want the new shinies, not the &quot;old&quot; ones that aren't the hot stuff anymore).<br />
<br />
Guess it's not that hard to see wich one Blizzard (and the company that own Blizzard, the one that really make the decisions today) will choose.</div></div><hr />

Neither do I understand ppl that are already way outgearing them claiming they are &quot;sad&quot; and &quot;angry&quot; that some changes have been made. It says alot about those ppl, how selfish and childish they are.<br />
<br />
I dont look at this a big nerfs. This is a balancing issues to make content more in sync with the rest. Some of the fights that have been &quot;nerfed&quot; were just bad design from the start and needed to be changed.<br />
<br />
There is one instance that Im personallly looking for BLizzard to totally refocus and make more intresting. And that is deadmines. Its a long instance that needs to get better overall flow - instead of having long line of trash to get to 3 endbosses. Thats not good design and needs to be fixed. <br />
<br />
Most of these changes are great and will improve the enjoyment of ppl. 3 pups at beaty for example was just over the top. It was pointless and didn't add anything to the game other than CC. Thats bad design cause not all classes can solve those CC problems.<br />
<br />
The sad part about this all is that ppl dont realise that Heroics are STILL challenging and will be challenging. We dont want to see total nubs jumping into the game now and ruin the LFD tool even further expecting to be carried through Dungeons. We dont want that ppl into Dungeons ever again. <br />
<br />
So ... stop crying ... Enjoy the game and look for new ways to make heroics challienging. Go naked if you want challenge !</div></div><hr />

Well, not disagreeing, but what this really means is that (pve) demo and affliction got the real nerf here... :(<br />
<br />
<br />
.. and I see that affliction warlocks needed - according to Blizzard - a lot more nerfing than frost mages in pvp. The sugar on the pill is the pvp 4 set bonus, which helps in arena at least</div></div><hr />

<br />
GRIM BATOL:<br />
Faceless Corruptors now move 10% more slowly. - Small nerf but why? Everyone have 10k. Corruptors die in the hall. And every class has a slow.<br />
Players may still use spell and abilities while afflicted by Forgemaster Throngus's Impaling Slam. - Small nerf. But ok.<br />
Valiona's Devouring Flame damage has been reduced by 20%. - Why? If someone dont see, she is casting this and fail two times kick him from group. Its base mechanic! Avoiding!<br />
<br />
HALLS OF ORIGINATION:<br />
The duration of the Flame Wardens' Raging Inferno has been reduced by 80%. - What????? Now two ticks? Or one? All meele and tank now can stay on this mob even if he cast raging inferno? LAME as hell. Avoiding!! If someone fail in this. He/she should be punished.<br />
<br />
Anraphet's Nemesis Strike now does 75% of weapon damage, up from 50%. In addition, the damage-over-time effect applied by this ability does 15,000 damage every 2 seconds, up from 9,000. - Yeah first buff. But in next patch will be nerfed.<br />
<br />
Earthrager Ptah's Flame Bolt now deals more damage per second on Heroic difficulty. - I even dont know what it is:)<br />
Setesh seeks a portal every 25 seconds, up from 20. - Small nerf for low DPS group. This is ok.<br />
<br />

Lockmaw no longer tolerates fighting in his treasure room. - Nice. Again bug fix after not swiming crocs:)<br />
<br />
SHADOWFANG KEEP:<br />

<br />
THE STONECORE:<br />
Stonecore Earthshapers' Dust Storm does slightly less damage. - Again why? But ok.<br />
Corborus<br />
The warning time for Thrashing Charge has been increased by 1 second. In addition, Thrashing Charge now happens 4 times, down from 5. - This is fine.<br />
The visual for Rock Borers spawning during the submersion phase is now different from the Thrashing Charge visual. - Finally.<br />
<br />
High Priestess Azil<br />
She grew! She's now 175% the size of a human, up from 125%. - ok.<br />
Gravity Wells should kill Devout Followers more quickly. - &quot;More quickly&quot; = ???. Two steps? Or even one?<br />
The cast time of Force Grip is now 1.5 seconds, up from 1. - OK small nerf.<br />
The size of the warning visual for Seismic Shard has been increased to more accurately reflect the area it affects. - OK.<br />
<br />
Slabhide<br />
The ground phase lasts longer and has fewer stalactites. - Big nerf. Again avoiding is no longer needed.<br />
<br />
Ozruk<br />
There is now a precast visual on the ground to make it clear how far away a player must get to be clear of Shatter. - What about show players where to stay?? On each boss.<br />
The cast time of Shatter has been increased to 3 seconds, up from 2.5. - Reaction nerf.<br />
Shatter damage is now reduced by armor, but has been increased by 33.3% (repeating, of course) as a result. - Big nerf.<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
Fixed a bug that made Ozruk's Shatter knockback component 10-yard range while the damage had a 15-yard range. Both are 15 yards now.<br />
<br />
THRONE OF THE TIDES:<br />
The damage done by Lady Naz'jatar's Shock Blast and Naz'jar Tempest Witch Chain Lightning has been reduced. - HUGE nerf. No longer to interupt this cast? And no longer to CC second Naz'jar Tempest Witch. ty blizz fo making this figt absolutely boring.<br />
<br />
Tainted Sentries Swell damage has been reduced. - This is nerf but I am fine with this. If you dont have mage and you have slow DPS. Its pretty hard.<br />

<br />
THE VORTEX PINNACLE:<br />
Creatures<br />
Desperate Speed cast by Temple Adepts has had its duration reduced significantly. - Why you didnt remove this? Becouse &quot;reduced significantly&quot; = like removed.<br />

<br />
Asaad<br />

Static Cling has had its cast time increased to 1.25 seconds, up from 1. - OK.<br />
<br />
Grand Vizier Ertan<br />
His health has been reduced slightly. - Health reduction underway. Lame.<br />
He now knocks away players standing too close to him when he retracts his Cyclone Shield, which now inflicts Nature damage if it touches players. - Ok. This makes sense.<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
Fixed a bug that made Ozruk's Shatter knockback component 10-yard range while the damage had a 15-yard range. Both are 15 yards now.</div></div><hr />

I don't have any numbers for it, but Cobra Shot seems to be making some serious damage as well for survival - couldn't Blizz just have decrease the mastery bonus for survival? Wasn't that what mastery was all about when introduced, easy tweaking of balances? Maybe because mastery isn't worth much it's not worth tweaking... And what happen to the MM and BM buffs?

If you lacked the CC on beauty you simply killed one dog more. Ashbury - how many classes are there that cannot interrupt? The dungeon finder has been designed to never allow two of the same classes in your group as far as I noticed. There are very few classes who cannot interrupt, like warlocks and even THEY could get a felhunter out in case of emergency as I often have done. No, the reality is that people do not interrupt even when they can. They have the environmental awareness of a rolling rock - charge through it, hope it fixes itself or someone else fixes whatever it is they cannot be bothered to do themselves. Just yesterday we had a rogue on pain and suffering who &quot;was terrible at interrupting&quot; as he himself said. Result: no interrupts. Maybe one. He was a cool dude, nothing against his person, but these nerfs are made for players like him: Players who cannot do something and do not want to learn how to do it.<br />
<br />
Spells like Swell are perfectly healable even if the group is completely retarded. Again, a nerf to placate bad healers and bad dispellers. Mages can spellsteal it, shaman can purge it, it can probably be dispelled, but how often have you actually seen any of those classes do that? How often have you seen a mage use his spellsteal ability in random pugs? I sure haven't, not unless I tell them to and even then it's always a gamble if they listen to me or not.<br />
<br />
Similarly, the buffs the mob gain in HoO. How hard is it for a melee to just stop attacking it when the buff is not getting dispelled? How hard is it for that enhancement shaman to purge it (very hard, for yesterday's shaman in any event, even after being told to). Yes, then melee may die. Inferno - a melee only needs to die once by it to know not to be there next time. Again, yesterday's HoO, we even wiped on it, but why is that bad? The next try every single melee, even that terrible shaman, did what he was supposed to do. Sure, they didn't kill the bubbles on the water elemental (I was healing), but maybe they'll learn THAT next time they go to HoO and the group wipes because it's the healer bubbled that time. Is it such a bad thing to submit players to trial and error and make them learn the hard way?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerion</div><div class="date">2011-01-12, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few of those Heroic changes look like they're designed to make group compositions less troublesome. Such as removing a spell that needs to be interrupted on Ashbury... making Naz'jar's Shock Blast less dangerous (so missing an interrupt probably won't mean a tank's demise) and removing a core hound pup on Beauty means you won't need at least two beast-capable CCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see what you mean, but the fact remains that they were all completely doable. <br />
<br />
<br />
Beauty, for instance, was easily doable without any cc if the group did not stand in The FIRE and had anywhere near decent dps.<br />
<br />
Same goes with interrupting, but on a different manner.<br />
<br />
Why there was so many interruptable spells in the first place was to get people pay more attention to actual boss mechanics and fight (or roughly put...to get players heads out of their asses) instead of rolling faces over the keyboard while staring a dps meter (which obviously is a playstyle stuck in some heads from the Wrath era). Still I see classes with interrupts not interrupting key spells, causing prolonged fights and wipes. The removal of some of these abilities will only hinder one's progress of learning to interrupt, leading into more problems later on.<br />
<br />
Sure it will be easier, but what's the fun in that...</div></div><hr />

Sure it was only minor tweaks here and there. The fact remains that every Heroic there is, is completely doable with a half decent group. So even the tiniest changes to ease the content are, in my point of view, step towards wrong direction.<br />
<br />
If the change is a fix to known bug, I totally understand it, but I don't see any reason what-so-ever to make content easier.<br />

And yes, I read the other changes as well. Most of them were good, though a tad unnecessary (because lets face it, if you open your eyes you see more, right?). And I'm happy that few of the easier bosses got some love too.</div></div><hr />

What was so much fun fighting 3 overgrown pupps in a crowded space + the boss ? <br />
<br />
Absolutly nothing. Thats why it was an optional boss that most are now skipping. Its a boring and badly designed fight. 3 or 30 pups dont add anything to the encounter.</div></div><hr />

I still consider first boss in VP as bugged. It needs buffing to make the fight actually enjoyable. But I will not see 1000 morons cry about it beeing fixed to make it more enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Get over it... Its a balancing thing that should be done. Right now DPS classes are waiting 30-40 mins for random and end up going into an istance that ppl dont want to do so they are leaving at start without doing any encounters. <br />
<br />
But hey.. these changes are not life yet... go enjoy it while you can. Not need to be buthurt because some balancing features.</div></div><hr />

Ashbury losing Mend Rotten Flesh?<br />
Pretty much an overal damage reduction on a lot of bosses. Meh.<br />
<br />
You're all QQ'ing at the 5man content changes as if all this would turn hardcore fights into walks in the park. Really now:<br />
- Setesh waits 5 more seconds before spawning another portal... wow, HUUGE NERF OMG QQ!!<br />
- Faceless Corruptors now move 10% more slowly - so now you have a slightly higher change of doing an achievement which is at the moment close to impossible<br />
- Players may still use spell and abilities while afflicted by Forgemaster Throngus's Impaling Slam - translation: you won't wipe any more if your healer gets impaled<br />
- Baron Ashbury has forgotten how to Mend Rotten Flesh - translation: fight won't take 15 minutes if you don't also have a melee DPS in the group<br />
- Lord Walden - Frost Mixture is now area-of-effect damage - so if you're not careful how you move you are likely to kill someone = harder fight<br />
- Altairus - Cyclones now knock players straight up, and players hit by a cyclone cannot be hit again for a few seconds = you can no longer be incapacitated for maybe 10 seconds like you were if you had the bad luck to be thrown from one cyclone into another. This turns a very hard fight into a hard fight.<br />
<br />
This and a bunch more visual fixes (so you actually know you're safe from a wipe mechanic instead of running wildly hoping you get withing safe distance in time) turn the game into Wotlk? I hardly think so...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How where heroics just nerfed to the ground?<br />
<br />
Seriously some people should realize that if you had trouble before you will still have trouble now. There were never impossible only challenging the first time through. After you learn the place the next time you go is a cake walk. These changes alter things that were rng or annoying and actually buff some other boss fights that were too easy.

<br />
Comes down to personal preferrance I guess, but I liked that fight as a healer. As a dps I'd think it is quite a boring fight and you are totally right there. It's a bad design, but it's not a reason to make it a walk in the park. <br />
<br />
This is where we should say to Blizzard: <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Fighting beauty isn't fun and it doesn't have any gimmicks or fun mechanics that would make it unique or enjoyable. So could you do something about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzards approach was to take off one of the puppies, which doesn't make the fight any different or more fun. What they did was really the easy way out:<br />
<br />
&quot;If it's bad, make it at least easy, so we can storm through it more quickly.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The only difficulty vanilla had over the subsequent expansions is the number of competent players you had around and how many you needed.<br />
<br />
Actually if you took the time to read GC's post you'd know he stated that he's happy with the overall difficulty of heroics with the exception of a few boss encounters he feels are either over-tuned or too gimmicky/based on group comp. No contradiction there.</div></div><hr />

I agree with both these statements. The heroics were fine as they were. It was nice to have challenge instead of a walk in the park. For those who QQed, well suck it up and either learn to play your class or just work on getting better gear before attempting them.

Those of us who enjoy a challenge and want longevity out of our heroics, can simply disable the buff, initially I thought, maybe add extra loot for the people doing it without the buff, but thats not even important, I just want a challenge, and I dont want these heroics to be boring in 6 months time.<br />
<br />
And if people are worried about the 'jackass' in the group flipping the buff off when people want a casual experience, it could be set so it has to be voted on before changing.<br />

The epic crafted items socket, is the best news ever though, crafted plate has been...kind of lame, blacksmith's should be able to craft competetive gear, not sub par garbage. A great change, cant wait.</div></div><hr />

When it come to heroics there is ONE nerf, and that ashbury. I know people have said this but seriously folks, find out what nerf means before you use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand how people are claiming there is only one HC Nerf on that list. Let's recap....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackrock Caverns - Beauty now spawns with only two pups in Heroic difficulty. (NERF)<br />
<br />
Grim Batol<br />
Faceless Corruptors now move 10% more slowly. (NERF)<br />

The warning time for Thrashing Charge has been increased by 1 second. (NERF)<br />

She's now 175% the size of a human, up from 125%. (NEUTRAL)<br />
Gravity Wells should kill Devout Followers more quickly. (NERF)<br />
The cast time of Force Grip is now 1.5 seconds, up from 1. (NERF)<br />
The size of the warning visual for Seismic Shard has been increased to more accurately reflect the area it affects. (KINDA NEUTRAL, BUT SORT OF NERF)<br />
<br />
Slabhide<br />
The ground phase lasts longer and has fewer stalactites. (MINOR NERF)<br />
<br />
Ozruk<br />
There is now a precast visual on the ground to make it clear how far away a player must get to be clear of Shatter. (NERF)<br />
The cast time of Shatter has been increased to 3 seconds, up from 2.5. (NERF)<br />
Shatter damage is now reduced by armor, but has been increased by 33.3% (NEUTRAL?)<br />

Grand Vizier Ertan - His health has been reduced slightly. (NERF)<br />
He now knocks away players standing too close to him when he retracts his Cyclone Shield, which now inflicts Nature damage if it touches players. (MUCH NEEDED BUFF)<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion, I look at that list and see:<br />
22 Nerfs<br />
6 Buffs (2 of which were needed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole point of being able to shapeshift was to grant immunity to polymorph. Here comes another polymorph nerf to druids for all shapeshifting. Why not knock us down another level since xpac release.<br />

GG Blizzard for giving in to the loudest moaner. Let me get my girlfriend in on this and she can get anything changed for me.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you are faced with the same playing field as the rest of the classes now.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, how is the mechanic for Blood and Thunder any different from Serpent Spread? Oh yes, lazy mages dont mind warriors beating them while their playing the wrong spec and crying about other classes AoE like lazy little bastards.</div></div><hr />

I will not be renewing my account until they continue along the line of making heroics fun again, like they were in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
This is either a terrible troll attempt or the worst player in the entire game I can't figure out which. Either way, we all knew they'd tune the heroics, but I didn't expect them to do it soooo fast. The challenge was the best part of heroics and now they are dumbing them down a little over a month after release. That's pretty disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, I look at that list and see:<br />

<br />
guys do you remember the times when corruptors where 10% faster, portals were every 20sec not 25 like now, and we couldnt properly see range of shatter or seicmic shards? that was old hard times, not like now these noobs doing these heroics now easier than in wrath. we just need some title for being &quot;everything is NERF&quot; whores and doing heroics the hard way!<br />
<br />
for all the sheldons out there, yes it was sarcasm.<br />
<br />
there is only two major changes in this patch notes (beauty and baron), both dealing with need of proper group composition to encounter this fights. now try to think about things, not sreaming OMG NERF anytime you see something that doesnt buff boss dmg</div></div><hr />

Get a grip guys, seriously. Complaining about this makes you look incredibly bad. <br />
How far are you in your raid progression anyway?<br />
<br />
<br />
What I really appreciate about the new patch notes is that frost mages are finally seeing the same latitude of PvP nerfs other reigning classes have been and will be seeing!<br />
<br />
Oh wait, I misread. Once again mage nerfs are applied through nerfing warlocks even more. gotta love the idiocy over at Blizzard HQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you!!! Now I am glad I waited to drop it.<br />
<br />
And loving the alchemy changes as well.</div></div><hr />
