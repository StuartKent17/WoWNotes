<br />
The dev chat is under progress, the transcript can be found below.<br />
Will the heirloom items scale to 85?<br />
The current plan is to have heirloom items stop at level 80 at the moment.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what new and exciting mounts there will be and what your favorite so far is?<br />
Not surprisingly there are all kinds of new mounts, we have spectral wolf/horse mounts, a dark phoenix, a camel, the new alchemy mount that turns you into a drake can ride, among others. Also a scorpion for the horde and a lion for the alliance. My favorite has to be the camel though... i mean really, who doesn't want to be a camel jockey?!<br />
<br />
Has Blizzard considered adding a &quot;Tabards Tab&quot; to the UI, so that tabard collectors can switch out tabards more effectively without having to take up bank and bag space? --Thanks! Deathunholy of Galakrond<br />
We have talked about adding a tabard tab. We've talked about doing a closet tab to handle it. It isn't something we are adding for Cataclysm though.<br />
<br />
Will it be as long of a wait to fight Deathwing as it was for Lich King?<br />
Hopefully not, we definitely have a goal to get our content patches out more quickly than we have in the past, without sacrificing quality of course, we plan for deathwing to be the most amazing encounter we've ever made! =]<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to potentially add queueing to the rated battlegrounds instead of it having to be a pre-made raid team? I was really excited when I first heard about this feature, but after reading the FAQ i was a bit disappointed with that design.<br />
we're currently looking into the possibility of having players in the honor battleground queue be able to be called to action by groups that aren't quite full, but we're going to see how the current queue'ing works out first so, that isn't something that would be available just yet<br />
<br />
Will you allow players to fill their quest log with say, 25 dailies, and then turn them in right after Midnight on December 7th to get a quick boost towards 85? This is how it worked in the beta, but some players are confused on whether it will work on Live. Thanks!<br />
Regarding 25 daily quests to turn in when the expansion goes live, this is something players have been able to do for the last 2 expansions and we aren't talking about changing it now.<br />
<br />
I understand the decision from an economic perspective but I was wondering if the deveopers were disappointed in the decision to allow race changes immediately following the release of the expansion.<br />
Regarding allowing race/faction change on day one. Actually this wasn't an economic decision at all. This was a decision that the leadership team made. Our priority as a dev team is to allow players to play the game with their friends, the way they want too. We also talked about the fact that this is a week one problem. So we made the decision not to restrict anything.<br />
<br />
Will darnasus be re built to be a real tree or will it always look like a dead stump with trees at the top.<br />
- ...but now that Deathwing is doing his thing it makes much more sense than it used to! ;]<br />
- Deathwing hates trees.<br />
<br />
A lot of players I know are trying to plan out what characters to roll for the new expansion, and the big question is: Will there be ANY new realms tagging along with the release of Cataclysm? Some point to low pop realms as a reason against, but surely with the redux'd 1-60 experience and the droves of returning players desiring clean slates, there has never been a better time for a fresh realm or two?<br />
We haven't decided exactly what the new realm decisions are yet, but we open new realms when there is player demand for them. One thing we can't do is plan all realms for day one. The goal is for realms to have good concurrency so everyone has a great game/matchmaking experience.<br />
<br />
Could you comment on the plan for raids in cataclysm? If i remember it was said that there would be smaller raids in cata but more of them. Would that mean like two small raids per patch or more patches in total? <br />
The idea is that we'll have more raid environments, but fewer bosses in each environment, but a similar total number of raid bosses overall... if that makes sense. =] so, for cataclysm launch we have the skywall environment, the twilight bastion environment, and blackwing descent, versus having almost all the bosses in one environment like we did with naxrammas.<br />
<br />
With the changes to the game environment itself, what new computer requirements will be optimal to run the game smoothly?<br />
One of the things that is really important to us is a great gaming experience regardless of your hardware. While the system requirements do go up over time, we do want the experience on slower machines to be great. We do this by trying to add a lot of graphical options to allow players to control the experience from &quot;runs fast&quot; all the way to &quot;looks great&quot;. <br />
<br />
Will there be more than one Legendary weapon in Cata? Will there be a Caster DPS legendary? Any info or plans would be awesome =) Thanks!<br />
It's likely there will be more than one legendary weapon, although it's too early to say for sure. We do, however, have a plan to do a caster dps staff soon.<br />
<br />
where did Uldum come from?<br />
- Egypt ;]<br />
- The idea with Uldum is that it has always been there, cloaked from the eyes of the players. The emergence of Deathwing has damaged some of the technology that kept it hidden. There is a story in the zone that explains this and what has been happening in the player absence. <br />
<br />
With resource systems now broadened to include focus, rage, energy, and runic power as well as mana, and there being conditionals like enrages, holy power, combo points and runes, will classes that just use mana be getting similar treatment or remaining as they are?<br />
Really that decision is made on a class-by-class, talent tree-by-tree basis. If we feel like the talent spec in question needs a broader resource management then we do it, but we don't like to unnecessarily complicate a spec's resource management if it isn't absolutely necessary.<br />
<br />
Is the Moonkin form for troll and worgen on the beta and ptr the final form or is it just a placeholder?<br />
Final! <br />
<br />
Why is it that we are not able to use Archeaology before the exspansion? I thought it was really cool how you guys released Inscription last time and would love to have the opportunity to level it before the exspansion drops.<br />
Using archeology before the expansion was something we talked about, but ended up adding everything about the profession to the &quot;post sundered&quot; world. Thus, you won't be able to use archeology before the sundering happens. <br />
<br />
The first tier of Cataclysm raiding has 3 seperate instances to tackle. Are you guys planning on keeping with the Burning Crusade model (SSC/TK, BT/Hyjal) and having multiple instances per raid tier? Will Deathwing have to share the spotlight with some other instance?<br />
We'll evaluate that on a tier by tier basis. When we have awesome ideas that we can successfully make happen we'll do multiple environments, but it won't necessarily always be the case. We do have a super cool idea for the deathwing tier though... ...or at least so we hope. =]<br />

Right now, up to 50% of Ignite damage disappears due to the technical limitations of spells critting within certain timeframes. This has implications for Mage dps and the value of Mastery as a stat. Is overall damage being balanced to compensate and can we expect a solution in the near future?<br />
We're resolving that by rolling up any &quot;lost&quot; ignite damage into the next ignite that overwrote it<br />

Is Hit rating intended to tramp all other stats but Str for Fury till the 27% hardcap? Seems excessive :)<br />
Generally speaking, we do balance hit rating to be the &quot;best&quot; stat until you're at the hit rating cap</div></div><hr />

(Ie, Ghostlands, Bloodmyst etc - the game still loads when you move there - as opposed to Uldum, you can swim around to it and look at it (farview etc)) but if you move into the zone you get teleported out. That's what they should do with those 4 old zones. (And they can do that, don't say otherwise)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I'm talking about. If people really wanted to know the answers to a lot of these questions they'd follow MMO Champion, or just use Google. A lot of this has been answered already. Granted, at this point there's not really a whole lot they can ask that hasn't been answered, but I'd love to see some new information that I'm sure the Devs would love to give as long as they're asked the right questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best Buy purposefully discarded almost all of the class questions. Ustream chat was trying to throw tons of balance questions at them, but Best Buy didn't want them talking about balance I guess.<br />
<br />
Most of the questions were really, really bad though. A simple search on MMO-Champion and/or BlueTracker would have answered over 75% of the questions there, no joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q: It was stated earlier that the design intent of Affliction was to have Shadow Bolt continue to be the filler, yet Drain Life is being Simulated as the &quot;better&quot; option. Is this intentional or is additional tweaking needed?<br />
<br />
Q: Hand of Gul'dan's cooldown and Immolate's duration are somewhat at odds making the two not mesh well at certain haste levels. Will we see any tweaking with this, or will players just have to be a little more cautious with their gear selections?</div></div><hr />

cause druid does feel the weakest and dk by far the strongest tanking class<br />

Totems like earthbind, grounding, and magma are fun, different and interesting.Totems like strength of earth, tranquil mind and windfury are simple buffs that could be provided in a much easier to use form by many other classes. It was fine when those buffs were unique to shaman, but with the homogenization of buffs, they just seem lackluster. Any plans on changing buff totems, how they work, or any other changes to the totem system to be overall more fun and unique and less dull and lackluster? It would really add a lot to the class if the totem system was better put together.</div></div><hr />

Worgen can ride the other mounts in the game, if that's what you're asking. They're not limited to their feral run.<br />

Hopefully not, we definitely have a goal to get our content patches out more quickly than we have in the past, without sacrificing quality of course&quot;<br />
<br />
Hopefully the next expansion is sooner after the end though. If we wind up with more than a year with Deathwing, that'll huuurt.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can't win with this, their goal is to do less and less &quot;free content patches&quot;. They went from 12 content patches in Vanilla to 4 in BC and 3 in Wrath, I would expect there to be no more than 3 in Cataclysm, and probably 6 months between them. So maybe Deathwing in July 2012. This will allow them to delay their next expansion for a little longer.</div></div><hr />

Using archeology before the expansion was something we talked about, but ended up adding everything about the profession to the &quot;post sundered&quot; world. Thus, you won't be able to use archeology before the sundering happens. <br />

<br />
I've searched and searched and there had been no confirmation one way or the other before now if it was a placeholder. People said it was, people said it wasn't, people said they're going to upgrade all the Moonkin forms in 4.1 (maybe they still will, I don't know).<br />
<br />
I asked because obviously I play a Boomkin, and lets be honest Troll racials are the best for Boomkins period. The only thing holding me back was if the forms were finalized or not, so come 4.03a I'll race change to Troll.<br />
<br />
<br />
I only wish I'd tacked on a question about if the flight forms would be in 4.03a as well since they aren't on the PTR.<br />
<br />
I was annoyed at all the questions about heirlooms and achievement points, and the ones that you'd see on the suggestion forums all the time. <br />
<br />
So if people really felt my question was horrible, sorry. But as I said I'd looked, there was nothing I could find that was one way or the other about the forms.<br />

Because they just said they wanted it in Cataclysm itself not before. Stop reading your own meaning into things and read what Blizzard is actually trying to tell you. <br />

<br />
<br />
Didn't something almost exactly like this happen in Final Fantasy 8?(Which I'm sure they probably stole the idea too.)<br />
<br />
Also, I wonder if Blizzard is under estimating the fact that race cars are really awesome and the Goblin areas are going to be flooded with 80s as well who want to get Goblin rep for their mounts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldCrow</div><div class="date">2010-11-19, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I tried to ask when I managed to get into the chat:<br />
<br />
1.) Have you fixed the issue with worgen's having a fifth leg in the running wild mode?<br />
2.) Wouldn't it look less terrible if they just had a modified wolf form for travel rather than a humanoid crawling really fast?<br />
3.) If you want us to play the way we want, how come the only heirlooms available for 80+ are for guilds? People in leveling guilds have less issue in this department as it is and it makes the soloer crippled in comparison. <br />
4.) Will there be a glyph for druids to remain in tree form when healing as a cosmetic-only if they want the option (ie minor glyph). Some people are really going to miss being in tree form when they're left with only seconds now. What was the point in designing new trees?<br />
5.) You talk about the much needed love the original content needed and the revamp of the world and leveling experience. Why haven't you updated the original character models to the level that we see with the goblins and worgen...or even with the belves and space goats? This question has been rather avoided. <br />
6.) Why are you making such a big fuss over deathwing and saying he's going to be released much earlier in raid thank LK was? You're not going to release another expansion that soon and we all suspect that an old god is behind all of this anyways, given the involvement of the elementals with Deathwing and that the twilight cult is involved. <br />
-- I havent done the research well enough on this, but question to MMO-Champions: What are the final racials? As they stand, some suck massively. --<br />
7.) Are you fixing the bugs occurring in the old game anytime soon and does this concern you as to what problems lay in wait for release day? Currently icecrown is buggier than AOL 1.0, mobs in instances are requiring skinning level 470, and I hear Shadowmourne is a world drop (not sure if that's intentional)<br />
8.) A blue posted somewhere that the LK couldnt have unique item models because the number of variations of the raids (IE different loot for 10man, 25, reg, heroic). Does this mean that itemization will be truly unique in Cataclysm? Saying that &quot;the other bosses in a raid are copying off Deathwing, not the other way around.&quot; just doesn't quite cut it.<br />
9.) Can we change the BM &quot;uber&quot; talent to be that the pets get their exotic ability rather than the spec being the only capable of using certain beasts? Certain raid buff/debuff abilities on pets are unevenly distributed amongst the classes (ferocity, cunning, tenacity). Is there a way we can spread this out or redistribute? Certain abilities are only available to Exotic pets, and to make matters worse they're on tanking pets. And can we flip carrion birds with birds of prey? That just always felt weird to me. You would think the hunters would be the dps pets while things like condors (scavengers, if you will) would be cunning. Crow = cunning. Eagle = ferocious. (that last one is obviously just preferential)<br />

<br />
Also, I wonder if Blizzard is under estimating the fact that race cars are really awesome and the Goblin areas are going to be flooded with 80s as well who want to get Goblin rep for their mounts.<br />
<br />
Gonna be an awful few weeks in that area.<br />
<br />
the first 10-12 levels for goblins will be in a phased area where no one but goblins can visit (and only while they are leveling those levels). It's kinda a screw job to deny all this content to every other player but it will cut down crowds slightly around the starting zones (2 islands that can't be visited later). Eventually yea there will be some crowding from the 12+ level areas but that will basically only be a bit of azhara and from there it diverges.<br />
<br />
What I find most annoying is that everyone but low level goblins will be locked out of two whole islands of content including quests, rare hunter pets and possibly even unique rewards. Gilneas is slightly different, I heard that the worgen starting stuff will also be very phased and that Gilneas will become a deadzone afterwards, so people get screwed there too but at least they can visit it, go &quot;ooooo, ahhhhh&quot; at all the new stuff and possibly see some rare/new random models standing around.

<br />
<br />
They are the Nelf model with a different skin. The troll has a black head/shoulders, redish body and a light tan belly. I think it's a cool looking skin, especially in comparison to the tauren one which is all shades of brown. I'm not sure on the worgen coloring, but it's the same model. Meaning tauren are the only druids with horns in moonkin as opposed to antlers.</div></div><hr />

Do the math. Blizz have gone into the effort of doing a new tree form (I do not wish to discuss here whether you like it or not :-)) even though it is &quot;just&quot; a cooldown now. They have made very individualized epic flight forms for the new druid races (even going for a bat with trolls). The fact that they have invested minimum time into the boomkin form says to me that they are hard at work on a total revamp of it which will be ready sooner rather than later. 4.1 is my estimate for the latest ETA, but I would not be surprised to see it much earlier. The very short and rather harsh answer to the question using the exclamation mark only reinforces that feeling in me (like, final for what we do with the old one but wait till you see the new one, buggers).

<br />
Yeah, Could you include Blood Elves and Draenei in this 1-60 revamap. If nothing else you could at least destroy ruined half of Silvermoon and blame it on Deathiwing /earthquake and do some healing in Ghostlands as Undead force there should be destroyed by now...</div></div><hr />

I was in the chat and in total there were 200-300 questions submitted. I don't doubt that there were many new and interesting questions in that lot but the fact is the Blizzard guys choose to answer a bunch of questions that had already been answered many times before. Of course, it doesn't help that people ask so many previously answered questions, I mean, just from reading the newsposts here on mmo-champion I could answer 90% of those questions myself before even seeing the Blizzard response.<br />
<br />
As for the reason the devs themselves choose to answer old questions, my guess is that this is viewed as a marketing exercise and not as a fan information thing. They want to choose questions that reference new features, how friendly the game is to new players, levelling speed, new zones etc as that is what will draw new players to the game. What they don't want is to answer questions about classes that are still undertuned, buggy implementations, talents that need revaming etc because even addressing those things would give the impression that the game is imperfect which is not the impression they want to give.</div></div><hr />

I agree with other people who stated that blizzard are unjustly smug about &quot;revamping the entire Old world&quot; yet they almost completely ignore Ghostlands, Eversong and Isle of Quel'danas.

<br />
ulgh people with this kinda attitude make me sad. We have a bunch of new content (not as much as last time though as far as new levels) but people wanna blow through it as fast as they can. It is people like this (not this person persay, especially since s/he hasn't thought of this pathetic plan of action before now) that give wow players the shut-in loser stereotype because they try far too much to progress in a game. People take this game and ultimately useless achievements in this game far to seriously. I'm not saying that everyone should be super-casual but noone should be super-pathetic-way-to-into the game seriously either. People push to level too fast then they complain that they arn't getting enough, or that the game is developed for casual players. Heres an idea stop pushing so hard for no good reason and try to enjoy what scraps they throw you.<br />
<br />
With the game as &quot;casual&quot; as it is, &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers ruin it for themselves even more by doing something like saving completed dailies so they can skip half a level or so, then they wonder where all their content is.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to restate that these questions were answered horribly.</div></div><hr />

My account was inactive for most of LK. Got to Algalon, guild had a mega emo fit and disbanded, didn't see the point (especially after still being burnt out over doing NOTHING BUT NEW OLD NAXX FOR 6 **** MONTHS) of looking for another guild so quit. Came back for Icecrown for a while. Tackled loooooool 'limited attempt' tests of server stability (because that, sadly, mattered FAR more than encounter design) until everyone got bored (which happened pretty fast - I can't IMAGINE that there are people who ran that instance every week, 10/25, for A FRIGGEN YEAR). Dropped the game until recently because, hey, the &quot;END of Teh World&quot; surely has some cool events associated with it right?<br />
<br />
incorrect, once again! *insert economics 101 equations about cost / time input vs profit / financial output here*<br />
ie, create the cheapest, ***** event possible because your average customer is 10-12 and, having the mental capacity of a freshly laid turd, will buy it and eat it anyway (most likely with a parent's money).<br />

Smug about revamping the zones?<br />
Does no one with a brain even question that, 'revamping the old content' supposedly being a major selling point, that it's kind of - funny - that they have also made it possible to level so fast that the revamped content is cleared in a weekend? Is their making it so ridiculously easy to level not pretty much an open acknowledgment that the majority of their content (1-80 anyway) is so freaking horrible that the vast majority of their players want to be done with it as quickly as humanly possible? I guarantee you will see ready- leveled characters for sale in their store some time in 2011 (&quot;don't want to level to 85? np 10$ and you can start at the level of your choice with level appropriate gear to get you started&quot;!)<br />

From a business standpoint I'm sure Blizzard is 100% win.<br />
They sure as hell don't care about their game though - and anyone who thinks they do has missed a few of the blazing neon signs that have been posted since the Activision merger.</div></div><hr />

My account was inactive for most of LK. Got to Algalon, guild had a mega emo fit and disbanded, didn't see the point (especially after still being burnt out over doing NOTHING BUT NEW OLD NAXX FOR 6 **** MONTHS) of looking for another guild so quit. Came back for Icecrown for a while. Tackled loooooool 'limited attempt' tests of server stability (because that, sadly, mattered FAR more than encounter design) until everyone got bored (which happened pretty fast - I can't IMAGINE that there are people who ran that instance every week, 10/25, for A FRIGGEN YEAR). Dropped the game until recently because, hey, the &quot;END of Teh World&quot; surely has some cool events associated with it right?<br />

incorrect, once again! *insert economics 101 equations about cost / time input vs profit / financial output here*<br />
