The Path of the Titans is a new form of character leveling introduced in the next expansion. The system is an expansion of the existing Glyphs and will ultimately add 10 Ancient Glyphs slots to your character. <br />
<br />
Ancient Glyphs are new items discovered through the new Archaeology profession, at this point we don't really have many details on it and I will probably write a mini-post later. <br />
<br />
Unlike conventional Glyphs, the Ancient Glyphs won't be tied to a class. Players will join cults dedicated to various titans and will follow its path, unlocking new glyph slots as they progress. You can earn progress down any of these paths by doing things such as questing, raiding, PvP, trade skills, etc. with a possible weekly cap for maximum progress. Over time, you&#8217;ll be able to unlock new ancient glyphs that will greatly benefit your character.<br />
<br />
During the Blizzcon developers made it clear that the goal will be gated and not grindy and that everyone would eventually get all their ancient glyphs. More slots might be added after the release of the expansion (in content patches, etc ...)<br />
<br />
The known paths are:<br />
Path of Aman&#8217;Thul, the High Father<br />
Path of Eonar, the Lifebinder<br />
Path of Norgannon, the Dreamweaver<br />
Path of Khaz&#8217;Goroth, the Shaper<br />
Path of Aggramar, the Avenger<br />
Path of Golganneth, the Thunderer<br />
<br />
We also saw a few glyphs from the Path of Golganneth, you can only pick one glyph for each rank.<br />
Rank 1 - Path of Golganneth - Physical damage taken reduced by 4%. or Reduces the duration of Bleed and Stun effects by 20%.<br />
Rank 2 - Path of Golganneth - Bandages heal targets by an additional 30%. or Nearby allies take 10% less damage for 6 sec. Instant. 5 min cooldown.<br />
Rank 3 - Path of Golganneth - Increases damage dealt by 10% for 10 sec. Only usable after you deal a critical strike. Instant. 5 min cooldown. or 2nd Glyph unknown<br />
<br />
Making all paths available to all classes will most likely create an insane amount of possibilities and it probably won't be a problem to find a tree that suits your playstyle. <br />

Addon Review - Rankwatch<br />
Cross-realms dungeons are awesome, players sometimes aren't. Rankwatch (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/rankwatch.aspx) is one of the most useful mod I used, it will monitor the spells cast by you and your party/raid members and warn them if they are using a downranked spell. A lot of people are running around and use lower ranks of spells because they never changed their bars or trained them after dual speccing, or even just because they use an outdated/bugged bar management addon. <br />
<br />
It's also very useful when leveling an alt, when the amount of lower ranks becomes too high you know it's time to train! Of course it's nothing compared to the joy of knowing you made the world of cross-realms dungeons better because the addon yelled at your paladin tank when he used his Rank 1 Consecration in the Halls of Reflection. Download it (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/rankwatch.aspx), now. <br />

&quot;Interesting&quot; stats<br />
I think you're approaching it as a player, in which your goal is to improve your character as much as you can as fast as you can. From that viewpoint, any piece of loot that isn't an unambiguous upgrade just gets in your way. But think for a moment about the over-arcing design of loot in the game and the role it fills. Deciding what is an upgrade is part of the challenge in the same way figuring out to beat the boss is part of the challenge. The hit stat represents a gearing challenge because you can't just assume any loot from Icecrown is an automatic upgrade. It may be a huge upgrade. It may be a sidegrade. It may be a slight upgrade, but only if you swap around a couple of other pieces, consider regemming, etc.<br />
<br />
In short, you have to game it.<br />
<br />
Put another way, even if there is a &quot;best in slot&quot; list for every spec, the order in which you get those pieces is significant, and makes you have to think and solve problems. That's why I call hit &quot;interesting.&quot; Spellpower, while quite desirable, is not interesting in that more is always better to the extent that we can't even offer variation on it from one piece to the next any longer. The rating-based stats, especially those with caps as low as hit, cause you have to solve the puzzle in order to wear them. There aren't a lot of huge decisions you make in WoW, beyond perhaps your class and maybe your guild. But there are a lot of little decisions that when taken together make the game fairly compelling.<br />
<br />
Too often players approach gear design as &quot;I would never wear that piece, therefore it's a badly designed piece.&quot; But consider for a moment that badge vendor +hit trinket again. It might not be attractive to you personally assuming you're hit capped in your current gear. Your conclusion might be that the trinket was itemized wrong. But that might not be the conclusion of say a Resto druid who decides to try Balance and now has a huge hit deficit to overcome. Regemming or farming old content is one way to do it, but relatively slow and / or painful. Getting a shiny new trinket off a vendor (i.e. isn't even subject to the whims of boss loot RNG) with a whole bucket of +hit on it starts to look pretty attractive. Just because the piece isn't for you doesn't mean it isn't filling a gap in the fabric of the game. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22049520286-no-hit-juggling-if-no-defense-juggling.html))<br />
<br />
+Hit bonus<br />
I will agree that the complication from hit that comes from bosses being higher level than characters, along with the difference among melee and spell hit and dual wield hit make the system more confusing than it needs to be, and the various raid buffs (and particularly Heroic Presence) can put you in a mode of constantly swapping around rings and bracers or whatever. This is something we'd like to improve. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22049520286-no-hit-juggling-if-no-defense-juggling.html))<br />
<br />
Spellpower, AP, and Armor Pen changes in Cataclysm<br />
We're changing spellpower, attack power and armor pen for other reasons, not really because they're confusing. For example, armor pen is almost impossible to balance because of the way armor works. Spellpower we're actually pulling because it's too boring -- it can virtually be derived from item level and we figure if we have to put both it and Intellect in equal proportions on every piece then something's wrong. AP makes us split leather stats in weird ways that make it attractive to warriors and hunters. It's just a cleaner design where everyone has a primary stat: Str, Agi or Int. Those are simple explanations to the point of almost being inaccurate, but you get the idea. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22049520286-no-hit-juggling-if-no-defense-juggling.html))<br />
<br />
Not enough Emblems of Frost?<br />
I am fairly confident we will all be drowning in Frost in several months wishing we had something else to spend it on. They feel precious now because the income is low because there are so few Icecrown bosses available (coupled with the fact that you aren't getting much non-badge loot because so few Icecrown bosses are available).

I don't think &quot;offtank&quot; is a role these days the way &quot;healer&quot; is a role. Most guilds have a main tank that they use on single target encounters, then they have a second tank that they use if the fight needs another tank. Maybe the MT is a better player or shows up more reliably or maybe she's the guild leader or maybe that's just the way the guild has always done it. For these guilds, presumably the warrior tanks Onyxia and the DK picks up the adds. On Twin Valks, each of them tanks one boss. On Mimiron, the DK probably doesn't do much tanking until the end. I wasn't trying to imply that DKs have a set of abilities or stats that make them suitable for OTing but not MTing. I was just pointing out that there are a lot of guilds with warrior MT and DK OT. I can't say for certain that this is the most common setup among cutting-edge guilds because I haven't looked lately, but my hunch is that is the case. There are actually quite a few different combinations of MT and OT that get used, which is a good thing.

Are you doing these Cataclysm summary just for the lack of any interesting news over the holidays or because you might know something we dont know from some of your inside information sources =)<br />
<br />
@Hit Rating, i really dislike that, because its such a low, easy to reach and easy too overshoot HARD cap, anything over the cap is just waste. All almost all hit from gear in most specs is utterly useless on trash, since you hit always anyway.<br />
<br />
My Ideas are, one make the hit cap &quot;softer&quot; i.e. you have the x rating to hit everytime. Everything after that could also improve your damage but significantly less, like lowering glancings/partial resists.<br />
<br />
In that way i like how hit works for dual wield classes. They need x for style cap, everything over that improves your white hits. Its not much, but its better than nothing. For Casters everything over the cap is as said wasted.<br />
<br />
Other Idea would be to make it much much much harder to reach hit cap, but that might be even worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
As an Arcane Mage, with really low hit requirement (around 200 as alliance), i hate that juggling around the hit cap. Damn Hit</div></div><hr />

Afaik most guilds are idd using warriors as mt.. but in our case we are sucessfully using a DK MT and pala OT.. warrior as 3rd.. and it works perfectly well for anub 25 hc just using DK on boss and pala on adds.. yes 1 add tank isntead of 2 works better for us.. just saying some of us arent using warriors that much and works perfectly well :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
GC stated at blizzcon that the path of titans would be tied to the spec for dual specs, so unless that changes you can have two different paths and sets of glyphs.</div></div><hr />

Death Knights Offtanks<br />
I don't think &quot;offtank&quot; is a role these days the way &quot;healer&quot; is a role. Most guilds have a main tank that they use on single target encounters, then they have a second tank that they use if the fight needs another tank. Maybe the MT is a better player or shows up more reliably or maybe she's the guild leader or maybe that's just the way the guild has always done it. For these guilds, presumably the warrior tanks Onyxia and the DK picks up the adds. On Twin Valks, each of them tanks one boss. On Mimiron, the DK probably doesn't do much tanking until the end. I wasn't trying to imply that DKs have a set of abilities or stats that make them suitable for OTing but not MTing. I was just pointing out that there are a lot of guilds with warrior MT and DK OT. I can't say for certain that this is the most common setup among cutting-edge guilds because I haven't looked lately, but my hunch is that is the case. There are actually quite a few different combinations of MT and OT that get used, which is a good thing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21971447874-why-do-dks-take-so-much-more-damage.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
Afaik most guilds are idd using warriors as mt.. but in our case we are sucessfully using a DK MT and pala OT.. warrior as 3rd.. and it works perfectly well for anub 25 hc just using DK on boss and pala on adds.. yes 1 add tank isntead of 2 works better for us.. just saying some of us arent using warriors that much and works perfectly well :)<br />
<br />
<br />
If i m not mistaken was a great QQing about warriors getting smashed when tanking the beasts enconter at early launch of patch 3.2. Now they are the kings of tanking again? Just wait and everything ll change once more.</div></div><hr />

The path of the titans; do you chose one path and unlock the &quot;gates&quot; granting more and more ranks as you progress in archaeology, eventually granting you one gryph per rank in a chosen path...<br />
... or do you eventually get to chose a glyph from all ranks from all paths?</div></div><hr />

Backwards much, Blizz?<br />
<br />
<br />
1) 24% hit is capping dual wielding white swings.<br />
2) You assume that the AP/crit/SP/etc will not be being merged into the stats for a roughly equivalent amount.<br />
<br />
Wasted stats only sorrta exist, did you see the part about people gearing offspecs, or just swapping gear around to get more of one stat and less of another. Just that a certian piece of gear may not be a good piece for you in your current gear. I remember taking some side grade pieces in ToC and holding onto them until i had ~4 of them and then it finally made sense to upgrade to them.</div></div><hr />

I like anything they put in the game that helps you seperate the good players from the terribads... Not that this is a good indicator but I'm not complaining.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">probert</div><div class="date">2009-12-30, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Path of the Titans strikes me as being Blizzard's interpretation of Lord of the Ring's Online traits and virtue system. I'm sure Blizz will put their own spin on the system and make it work within the Wow mechanics, but I've always found the LOTRO traits to be a clever way to add another progression stream for characters in the game, without being cumbersome or nonsensical.<br />
<br />
Basically in LOTRO you do stuff as a character (say, complete # of quests in a zone, or kill # of monster types) and you unlock a 'trait'. The trait will have multiple ranks, additional points can be earned in that trait by accomplishing other feats. Encourages players to do different things in the game, visit additional zones, slowly progress their end game character. <br />
<br />
Think of it as gaining in-game abilities, for accomplishing WoW achievements. They're a form of talent points, you can equip and unequip traits as appropriate. (e.g. i'm a dpser, i can equip traits that boost my AOE dps, or single target DPS).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigjay</div><div class="date">2009-12-30, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stop the qq about hit imo. There needs to be something to balance and plan around on gear. Eventually it will reach the point where the gear only has a number. I have shoulder 112 now, that’s shoulder 114 let me upgrade to it. Then they’ll get rid of slot based armor, you’ll just get armor token 114 and can put that in any of your slots. But maybe needing 16 tokens is too much so they’ll change it to one. So you can have one armor token with one number and that determines everything for you. Nice simple clean right? That’ll make the game really fun to won’t it. I understand condensing some stats like they’re doing but going too far will just be another giant slap into this game requiring no thought. Personally if I wanted to completely turn off my mind I’d just stare at a wall. <br />
<br />
I laughed when I saw that addon, I will probably try it to see if that explains some things I see in the new heroic finder. If down ranking dpsers is really why some have such low damage then everyone getting this to spam them in every heroic they go into until they fix it will make the world a better place. So everyone go download it. <br />
<br />
Path of the titans does look interesting and promising but hopefully it doesn’t end up causing all kinds of balancing issues, and pvp v pve issues. While they’re trying their best not to do it and to prevent it, way too much pve stuff in the past was adjusted because 2v2 wasn’t where they wanted it. They’ll eventually end up with a ton of overlap or no thinking involved in the talent trees. If you strip out all that’s not fun and are static increases and add in this new system you’ll just run out of things to put in the talent trees. So I’m hopeful for this but also very cautious.</div></div><hr />

sheesh, i was using lower rank spells for like 8 months or so, too, it can happen, tho in my case it wasnt much about training rather than not updating macros from BC with downranking, but i havent noticed it until i dueled with guildie enha and realized he had more powerful LHWs than me as ele and i was like what the heck, then i told him about it and was being laughed at for several days from firends. not that it really mattered in ele spec, having LHW little weaker, anyway, but hey, some things can happen, especially on alts.</div></div><hr />

Half of these things seem like racial / worship choices that should have been expanded from your character's initial background anyways. EQ had this from day one, it just took a back burner to AA's.

Clearly you're trolling, but I'll bite none the less. People that use Dual spec (as pointed out in this thread if you read and thought before posting) don't have their bars updated. I would consider that a bug. I'll use my Warrior as an example. I leveled as Fury and trained Dual spec at level 78 so I could practice tanking. When I wasn't tanking I was DPSing (lol duh) so when I hit 80 and trained all the spells the ones in my 2nd spec didn't update on my bars. So if I was tanking I was probably using the wrong spells. (I double checked, but many people don't forget). I've played/raided with many &quot;smart/good&quot; player that have made this mistake and used Rank 7 consecrate for like.....5 months?</div></div><hr />

Sure, Rankwatch comes handy when leveling up when you get new skills every two levels. Anyone can forget to upgrade them sometimes when they dont automatically do it.

This makes NO sense. Why would you need 251s and 264s if you are not running ICC??? The way Blizz has it set now is that you can get to CC by just doing heroics. If you do lots of heroics and get full triumph gear, you should be ready for ICC....</div></div><hr />

AP makes us split leather stats in weird ways that make it attractive to warriors and hunters. It's just a cleaner design where everyone has a primary stat: Str, Agi or Int. Those are simple explanations to the point of almost being inaccurate, but you get the idea.&quot;<br />

Sounds pretty uncompelling to be honest... I wish Blizz would stop dumbing down the game.</div></div><hr />

I like more stats, i feel good when choosing the wright one, also loot list will be ......... Why remove def stats from a tank? tank is a tank defence cap is somthaing that diferentiate him from melee dps apart from other stats, Attack power and spell power.... ok lets cut the crap blizzard. There is only one reason in the world why are u doing this, so that 12 year old kids that started playing in wotlk can easyer manage a char. Witch is just not fair since ur making other people that played their chars for couple of years did the math, looked at loot list, tryed diferent talents etc now, feel like idiots, Ur making all the forums, stats builds, websites guides, and people that play for years obsolete and not needed. And why? to make it easy for 12 year old kids and casuals, and your desighners witch will make gear instead of 6 stats now they have to put 3. I know its pointless to write this since proly no one from blizzard will read so it becomes a pointless qq, even if someone readed it still woudnt do anything, but i just had to say some things.</div></div><hr />

Yes I do know I'm using rank 8 Flamestrike at lvl 80, but that's in conjunction with Rank 9 so the dot stacks and gives me more crits for Hotstreak.<br />

You must have run into an old version of RankWatch, since that was added as a special case about 3 versions ago.</div></div><hr />

Even if someone from Blizzard would sacrifice 10 min of his/her life to decrypt your wall of bad grammar it's still pointless QQ-ing. To remove all the retarded, unneccesary stats is one of the best decisions ever. To everyone who likes going back to naxx25 to get more avoidance gear in the middle of totc25 progress or sell their souls to the cloth devil when they should wear mail: Blow me!<br />
Finally, hopefully, gear which is supposed to be upgrades will be!<br />
<br />
And to those who like to micromanage their stats, go through hours and hours of theorycrafting just to make a simple yes/no decision when that item drops: You got your life back! Congrats!</div></div><hr />

Since I live on battlegrounds and world PvP all I want is Damage and Survivability bonuses. I don't want Haste! I want Str and resistance to slow effects!</div></div><hr />
