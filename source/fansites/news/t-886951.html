I think that's only for kittys, since they mentioned like two days ago that they'd double cat swipe damage. Not sure though</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, for even with the new buff to death strike, you'd need to take like 100k dmg in the 5 seconds before your DS for it to override the glyph of dark succur automatic 15% heal (If I'm not totally wrong in my calculations, asuming you have approx 130k HP)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Won't change too much, as most times you use Death Strike it won't be a bigger heal than the base 15% from glyphing</div></div><hr />

As others have pointed out, this is a buff to kitty swipe. Additionally, the &quot;buffs&quot; to bear swipe and thrash were merely to compensate for removing the threat modifier. They will do more damage than on live, but the same amount of threat. In essence, the only buff swipe got is the CD reduction.</div></div><hr />

90%? Your healing is low now? That's why there are DKs out there soloing level 80 raid bosses, right? Because it's too low?</div></div><hr />

More than fine. But love how they buff the DK healing, and turned around and nerfed the hell out of Prot Paladin's (refering to WoG 20sec CD).<br />

<br />
To be fair, many of them are doing it in Blood Spec, but in Unholy Presence and DPS gear, which won't work come 4.1, cause Blood Shield won't work in Frost/Unholy.<br />

It seems crazy, but unless you are very well geared you need all that healing just to survive, DKs kinda blow major chunks if you took the self healing out of the equation, they are built around the concept.</div></div><hr />

Please read the tooltips. Different swipe buffs apply to the cat and bear forms of swipe. And tanking is already absurdly wrathlike easy and it has done nothing to dps ques. And in aoe threat bears were behind, if not by a landslide by a notable margin.</div></div><hr />

Hows that heroic raiding going then? Expect more buffs to come to put dks on equal ground. People QQ about blood dks being op have clearly never set a foot in heroic cata raids yet with a blood dk being spiked from 100-30-0% in 1½ sec<br />

because feral druids waste energy swiping in pvp?<br />
<br />
only time a feral druid should use swipe is with 4+ mobs that will die fast (talking kitty)<br />
otherwise, its more beneficial to get up 2-4 combo pt (depending on crit) rips on 3-4 long living target in terms of total dps.<br />
<br />
swipe is awful atm, and even worse in pvp as it generate no combo pts.</div></div><hr />

Mitigating damage by 40% (i.e. prot paladin block) &gt; healing back 20% of the damage after it's already been applied (possibly killing the DK in the process...). Not to mention that blocking has no cooldown, while DS does, hence not every single hit can be even &quot;mitigated&quot; through DS the way every hit can be mitigated through block.</div></div><hr />

I think Death Strike should heal for 90% of the damage sustained.Our healing is low now and 20% it's nothing<br />

We also realize that Dark Succor and Blood Shield are uncoupled in 4.1 pretty much hosing down Blood DK, hmm?<br />
<br />
No, I suppose we don't. Here's the number one problem with PvP in this game; the community is completely retarded and don't understand how anything outside of their comfort zone operates. <br />

Ok, we get it, you know nothing about this game. <br />

This is a PVE adjustment. Remember that? PVE? It's what 90% of the game is based around. DK have NO shields, and the worst mitigation around. Not only that, the way the blood shield is working in 4.1 vs live is different. This just makes DK tanks sliiiightly more viable in endgame content.</div></div><hr />

Unless i've missed something, since that &quot;hotfix&quot; there have been something called &quot;4.96&quot; which changed DS to 15% heal. It's not a tooltip fix, it's a nerf reverted (at long last, now we just need some of the armor nerf from bpo revereted and it'll be alright. There is quite a problem when one tank have 2/3 of the other 3's armor with the same gear, while two of them have passive avoidance AND passive mitigation built in (helllo our friend block), while for dks the &quot;block&quot; isn't permanent and depends on using an ability that use ressources, and needs to be timed to be exploited fully, AND part of their damage mitigation they are balanced around is supposed to be up 100% of the time... while being something that needs to be kept up by keeping Blood Runes on cd regularily... while others have it as a passive. Yeah DK tanks are perfecty balanced :().</div></div><hr />

Personally I use SotR if I have the 100% crit buff which is often otherwise &quot;might&quot; use WoG. I'm still easily healable. Using WoG as Ret is a big NO too.<br />

What will change is the PvP usage of WoG when Ret palas get multiple procs of HoL. Ret Palas already suck at PvP and can be kited to death by casters and hunters.</div></div><hr />

No really, I do play a warrior (in pvp at least) and I can understand what people are getting at when they complain about the healing from blood DKs, but it really does only affect melee and the game isn't balanced around 1v1.

If i get unlucky in raid pulls and dont avoid 3-4 mob hits at the same time, i my health halves in a second, the healers cant even react on that. On my Pally which is with almost the same gear, a bit worse off maybe, i do not have the same problems because i have a shiled and i block the damage that i dont avoid. <br />
<br />
5% more healing will not do anything. As for PVP, there you use more the 7% of totall health heals than the 20% given by the last 5 sec...but you wouldnt know that as most of you do not play DK pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I referred to raiding, and mostly heroic, where at least I as a DK tank are alot less viable compared to the other tanking classes</div></div><hr />

Why are retards like you, that aren't able to read and don't know what they are talking about allowed to post? And you are not alone in this thread...<br />
<br />
The change Blood-DKs' Healing here has no effect in PvP. Why? Cause Blood-DKs playing PvP are using the Glyph and Unholy presence, which heals for more, than the additional healing this change is granting to them. Furthermore Blood-DKs are geting nerfed this patch in PvP. And I, as DK, think, that this is ok!<br />
<br />
In PvE this is a small survivability boost...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not talking about blood dk heal. I'm talking about 20 second CD on WoG, which means DK will be the only one to be able to solo practically everything, once again (as intended).</div></div><hr />

I agree, blood DK in pvp has a little bit of insano survivability. I read two pages or so back that dark succor might not work for blood presence? That would be kinda a big nerf to them, but probably not enough as the survivability lost by being unholy presence isn't that huge.</div></div><hr />

Palis could solo stuff fine before WoG even existed.</div></div><hr />

Yes. All classes can solo stuff. But no one is anywhere close to blood dk.<br />

<br />
mustve quoted the wrong person. meant to quote one of the uninformed people who think that it was never dropped to 15% on the ptr.<br />
<br />
actually i know i quoted the wrong person because i just did it again and had to edit this post &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Limulsuis</div><div class="date">2011-04-17, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It ISN'T a tooltip fix, let's write the story:<br />
4.0.1: DS healed for 25%, hotfixed down to 20%<br />
4.0.6: DS nerfed again to 15%<br />
4.1: DS buffed up to 20%<br />
<br />
It's a buff, and it's fine for PvE, will have no value for PvP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pantelija</div><div class="date">2011-04-17, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Havent had a chance to heal a dk tank in a raid, but I know theyre easily the hardest to heal in heroics. I know this is by design, but maybe this buff to self healing will help the healers out a bit more<br />
<br />
I dont know what kind of death knight tanks u have been meeting in heroics but on my battlegroup or atleast in my heroics death knight tanks barely need any healing on bosses (I had some dk tanks even solo most heroic bosses when rest of the group did some stupid stuff and died)<br />
<br />
So either u were playing with really bad tanks or u are spreading lies.<br />
<br />
Also i must laugh at people saying Blood dks are balanced and need more fixes and that rest of us are ignorant &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

Cooldown reduced to 3 seconds and the damage has been greatly increased.. I can´t even figure out by how much because every build buffs it more... it looks like about a 4x damage buff over what we have on live.<br />
<br />
For anything except endgame raiding, this is going to make tanking absurdly easy.. almost wrathlike. Either the cooldown buff OR the damage buff, but not both were needed. Bears were not behind other tanks<br />
<br />
On top of that, we are getting a buff to our AOE shielding along with buffs to most single target attacks and thrash, our other aoe attack.<br />
<br />
All of that coming for a spec that really wasn´t that hard to play before. Is this Blizzards other plan for reducing dps queues?<br />
<br />
Terribly wrong. Bear swipe had its cooldown reduced, thats it. Kitty swipe had its damage increased, thats it.</div></div><hr />
