Announcement Regarding Recent MMO-Champion Account Deletions<br />
We have been receiving a number of support requests from users who have recently had their accounts deleted. As outlined in these articles (https://curseweb.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002804333-EEA-Data-Transfer-Notices-Detailed-Information), we are asking users in the European Economic Area (the EEA) for their consent to transfer their account(s) and corresponding data to Fandom. Recently, we deleted accounts and data for users who did not provide consent.<br />
<br />
In order to allow users to reclaim deleted accounts, we are building an account reclaim service (https://www.mmo-champion.com/accountRecovery.php) that will be co-managed by Curse Media and Twitch. As outlined here (https://curseweb.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002804333-EEA-Data-Transfer-Notices-Detailed-Information), Twitch will retain a copy of deleted data that can be used to re-create an MMOC account if a user chooses to provide consent. Don't worry - your usernames cannot be sniped during that interim period.<br />
<br />
We understand that losing access (even temporarily) to MMOC is frustrating. To minimize the impact of this transition for users in the EEA, we sent emails to MMOC users with an opt-in link and placed a modal on MMOC with an opt-in button. If you were running a browser or a browser extension that selectively blocks content on web pages (for example, ad blockers), it is possible that the MMOC opt-in modal was blocked.<br />

Patch 8.1.5 VO<br />
The initial Patch 8.1.5 PTR build (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8257-Patch-8-1-5-PTR-Build-28938) added Kul Tiran jokes, flirts, and lots of VO!<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 8.1.5 PTR Installation Size<br />
We’re actually testing some new improvements that allow the client to share the majority of game data between installs, so you don’t need multiple copies of the entire game in order to test things on PTR.<br />
<br />
To use this, you’ll need to be using the Beta version of the Battle.net app (Click the Blizzard logo in the upper left -&gt; Settings -&gt; Beta -&gt; “Switch to Beta”). Then, when you install the PTR, it’ll only need to download about 2.5gb of data. Note that if you have the PTR already installed, you’ll need to uninstall and reinstall it to use this new tech.<br />
<br />
Once it’s installed correctly, you’ll see a new folder called “_ptr_” under your World of Warcraft folder, which should be MUCH smaller than a completely separate install.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classic Development Q&amp;A<br />
The development is definitely moving along but it’s a complicated process and I don’t have any specific details to share at this point. We know you’d like to have a Q&amp;A and a variety of things answered, but we’d prefer to have concrete answers to give you guys or new information. I’m personally very opposed to doing a Q&amp;A for the sake of doing it without saying anything new. For everyone’s sake that’s just the better choice when it comes to these types of things.<br />

I remember the one back in Legion where Krom was making fun of Donald for failing a lvl2 keystone, and Donald replies that his teammates said it had the hardest affix ever. Krom responds that lvl2 keystones have no affixes. Donald shows him 'soulbound', to which Krom says that's not an affix. Donald states it means HE has to be in the group, which leaves Krom dumbfoundedly agreeing that it IS an affix. Having Donald in the group is one of the toughest affixes ever.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, we have joked in my weekly group that our fifth affix is having a resto shaman.<br />

Or the ones that say well I don't even use that email anymore and don't remember what it is. Well it's just like when you move in real life you need to make sure you update your address.

The time to give consent to your mmo-account switch to Fandom ran out, so a bunch of accounts got deleted. You can see posts in which the account posting is just listed as &quot;Deleted&quot;. I'd assume those simply disappeared from blocked lists and such.<br />
<br />
Now, if they use the recovery thingy to get their account back, dunno if you have to re-add them to your blocked list.</div></div><hr />

My 10 year old account was registered on an old e-mail address that I no longer have. At one point a few months ago the password was changed by MMO-Champion (for security reasons I guess). I tried getting it changed to a current address, but failed to do so (before all this started). So I didn't get the mail, run ad-blocker, so I didn't see any popup, couldn't log in and now lost a 10 year old account. It sucks, but hey, at least now I can troll anonymously again :P</div></div><hr />

I was browsing a thread earlier and I saw some of the dumbest posts I'd ever seen in my life, with some of them bordering on racism and misogyny and the majority of them were from now deleted accounts. If those people don't get their accounts back, I won't shed a single tear.</div></div><hr />

But this is hardly mmo-champions fault, it's the GDPR that forces them to seek consent. If they do now have it, they are forced to delete the data they received.</div></div><hr />

I don't blame MMO-Champion for seeking consent, I was just stating why the way they did it was not working for me (and many others). It's a silly thing that they didn't post this on the homepage, or redirected users directly to their profile where they could check a box for consent. Mail gets blocked or sent to old addresses, popups get blocked and there were much better options to get the user's attention. The fact that they put it on the frontpage now and had to make a recovery tool is ample evidence that the way they handled this hasn't worked well for a lot of people.<br />
<br />
I tried recovering my old account, btw, but it says the e-mail address is unknown, so my 10 year old account is gone forever. It's not a big deal though. I'm not proud to show off my wasted time on here, so it's nice to start over ;)</div></div><hr />

I had 3 emails and a pop-up on site. I accepted all 3 (yes even turned off addblock -- the horror) and even a site one and still got account wiped.<br />

<br />
They're not keeping a backup under the new owner, the recovery tool requests the information from the old servers which are still under Twitch. Also as far as I know they would only need to remove user data from backups if the users ask for it. Not consenting to the transfer to Fandom doesn't mean Twitch has to delete the user data as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are references in the client to this new shared data method also supporting Beta and Classic clients (in addition to retail/ptr currently). If Classic shares file formats with live (demo was pretty close, only a patch or so behind as it was based on 7.3.5 formats) it can probably share up to 60%-70% of its files with retail (there's still a lot of old content in retail) making it a pretty small download for those wanting both installed!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That you are probably right about: still what can they do? It was probably too less, and they could have added a big news pinned on topic that in x days your account gets deleted. But beside of that they did a lot to remind people to give their consent.<br />
<br />
What i wonder is that many people don't have access to their e-mail-adress. I have a lot of them around, but i still have access to every single one of them; some i still use after i registered it around 15-20 years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: to people saying they didn't check their mail so they didnt know - there were like 3 separate news posts about the upcoming transfer to Fandom.

It was probably too less, and they could have added a big news pinned on topic that in x days your account gets deleted. But beside of that they did a lot to remind people to give their consent.<br />
<br />
What i wonder is that many people don't have access to their e-mail-adress. I have a lot of them around, but i still have access to every single one of them; some i still use after i registered it around 15-20 years ago.<br />
<br />
This e-mail address was about 25 years old and came with the ISP I had at the time, which was the only way we got e-mail addresses back then. Few years ago I switched ISP and lost the address. I changed it everywhere, but forgot this place :(</div></div><hr />

lol what the fuck?<br />
<br />
&quot;give us consent to use and sell your data or we delete your account smileyface&quot;<br />

curiously, does GDPR apply to eea countries? i actually do not know!</div></div><hr />

That’s the entire point of the consent, it was due to GDPR. “EEA” is everything affected by GDPR. The consent is to transfer data from one owner to another. Without consent, the data has to be deleted due to law not due to threats to consent.</div></div><hr />

Many thanks chaud for trying to help me up and finally restoring my current (new) account that password got tangled for a reason (and i was thinking that account was prevented from being created because the mail was allready being used for another account, my old one that is).<br />
<br />
It wasn't and the mail i was using is completely forgotten (since i tried the ones i remember!)<br />
And yep, &quot;i consent&quot; don't delete this one too! :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: Hmm... 102 posts. It seems i had another account after all. Forgot about that too! That's what you get when you are coming back for Classic after quitting a game at 2013! :D</div></div><hr />

Yeah this is what I thought too, isn't it a conundrum that they kept the data of those that didn't consent? :o</div></div><hr />

The data is still on Curse’s servers. The accounts are viewed as deleted due to no data on Fandom’s servers. The account recovery tool simply allows you to retroactively provide consent and transfer data to your account’s spot on Fandom’s servers. The account is still there, it’s just empty, which is why all these posts say “deleted”.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not so much the losing, it's how it was handled and carried out. <br />
<br />
The initial prompts to do it all was apparently a pop up or something. So people like myself who run pop up blockers or ad blocks (MMO is horrendous with adds) never got a warning. It should have been pinned to the home page in a thread like this one was from day 1. As for getting emails through, that's all well and good but I signed up 7 years ago on an old email, while I still have access to it, it only ever receives junk mail in it. I literally only use it for old emails I've archived. <br />
<br />
Then in the aftermath some of us created posts asking wtf was going on, which were immediately closed and redirected to another post (Which was fair enough, but I couldn't find it when I manually searched related words or buzzwords). When I got into that post, the OP information just stated there will be another time frame opening so people can opt back in and get their names back. Nothing more than, no specific. Quoted moderators asking questions and no responses were given after the first few pages. <br />
<br />
Then a matter of hours later, we were forced logged off those accounts (Just to clear up, if you didn't opt in you didn't lose the account just the name got changed to MMC-r8791485-4305823-4 shizzle) and of course; legit who would have thought of writing down a username like that. So we couldn't get back on short of making a new account, and for a while there was no update until this post was uploaded. Now that period may have been a few seconds or a few hours idk, I came on saw I had been logged off, so new updates so closed it until last night. <br />
<br />
Then last night, activated the recovery process. Was told it could take 30 minutes. I still hadn't had it this morning. On the off chance I checked and it was in my junk mail. While this happens, I find it fishy literally every other email I've had from MMO goes straight to the inbox.<br />
<br />
TL:DR It was a colossus shit show</div></div><hr />

Also as far as I know they would only need to remove user data from backups if the users ask for it. Not consenting to the transfer to Fandom doesn't mean Twitch has to delete the user data as well. They do not have to delete it, if they have properly implemented GDPR in the first place, which does not seem to be the case? We have the new MMOC becoming compliant but not Twitch?</div></div><hr />

*shrug* I'm all for Fandom being compliant, if Twitch isn't that's their problem that I'm sure they'll get shit for (when it is actually enforced actively) if it turns out they're not dealing with GDPR properly.<br />

Maybe you should have kept your e-mail address up to date. :D Also, keep in mind it is likely much more of a mess for people actually going through a company transition AND having to deal with this. Unless you are a paying customer, maybe cut them some slack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or maybe I have a recreational email for all my old websites like this? and a work / day to day use one I have for important stuff? And frankly I don't care if it's a mess for them to sort out, the whole mess could have been avoided by literally making a post opposed to a pop up. That was just stupidity.</div></div><hr />
