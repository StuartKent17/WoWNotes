During Phase 2 of the Al'ar encounter in Tempest Keep, Al'ar occasionally charges at a random player. The damage dealt by the Charge was severe enough to immediately kill a lightly armored target even if the player was at full health. We've reduced the damage done by this Charge ability. <br />

Totally unrelated, I added a map to the Skyguard Reputation Guide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=253), not watermarked, you can use it anywhere. Will probably add a few things to it later, feel free to mention anything missing in comments. <br />
