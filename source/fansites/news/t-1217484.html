Brawler's Guild Updates<br />
The Horde Brawler's Guild was updated in the latest PTR patch, making it less plain looking. It is clearly still in the middle of changes, as a wall is missing and some NPCs are floating. Milhouse Manastorm will be making his return as one of the harder bosses you get to fight! <br />

Pet Battle Rankings<br />
If pet battles are not already exciting enough for you, maybe these rankings will help. WoWProgress added pet battle rankings (http://www.wowprogress.com/petscore/) this week, based on (http://www.wowprogress.com/post/123_How_Strong_is_Your_Battle_Pet_Army%3F) the number, quality, and level of the pets you have collected. The top ranked players are nearing 20 rare level 25 pets!<br />
<br />
Along with this, we updated WoWDB (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets) to show the level at which pets learn a skill, which pets can learn a skill, if a pet can be traded or not (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-can-battle=0), if a pet can battle or not (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-can-battle=0), if a pet is unique or not (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/battle-pets?filter-unique=1), and more!<br />

Mists of Pandaria Flying for Alts<br />
WTB Book of Pandaren Flying (BoA - requires level 90 to purchase) = 2400gold, PST.<br />
We're not sure if we'll be doing this. The tome worked out well enough for Wrath of the Lich King as an experiment, but so much of the experience we spent a lot of time and effort shaping in Pandaria is negated by flying. In addition to the upcoming reputation changes for alts (when a character on the account hits Revered), we'll consider other methods of potentially speeding up the leveling process for alts, but we don't think &quot;allow flying&quot; is necessarily the best answer. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/242224-wtb/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7004031268?page=2#23))<br />

Updated Raid Schedule Heart of Fear &amp; Terrace<br />
Oct 30: Heart of Fear (N)<br />
Nov 6: Heart of Fear Part 1 (LFR), Heart of Fear (H)<br />
Nov 13: Terrace of Endless Spring (N), Heart of Fear Part 2 (LFR)<br />
Nov 20: Terrace of Endless Spring (LFR), Terrace of Endless Spring (H)<br />
<br />
This is correct. It's a similar release to what we did with Mogu'shan Vaults.<br />
<br />
Neth, any clue as to what the ilvl requirement's will be for HOF LFR?<br />
The iLevel for the Raid Finder will be a minimum of 470. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/242158-updated-raid-schedule-heart-of-fear-terrace/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7006890938?page=4#62))<br />

Blingtron 4000<br />
&quot;The Blingtron 4000 will be fully stocked with a variety of fun items such as Party Grenades, but even better than that, it has a chance (a very, very small one) to give the gift of an Engineering mount or pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does that include the Depleted-Kyparium Rocket and Geosynchronous World Spinner<br />
You are perceptive. There is a very small non-zero chance for a mount or pet from the Blingtron 4000 Gift Package (http://www.wowdb.com/items/86623-blingtron-4000-gift-package). We heard you like bling so your pal Blingtron may be getting some minor upgrades to their bling in an upcoming patch. <br />
<br />
With plenty of bling to go around, share the happiness. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/242142-blingtron-4000/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794351939?page=8#150))<br />

Players Botting<br />
But why would Blizzard ban bots?<br />
They have a active subscription and pay money.<br />
Why would any company reduce their own income on purpose?<br />
It doesn't make sense... Allthough I don't like so many bots either.<br />
But for them to actualy ban most of them, and lose out on so much money <br />
from the botter's subscription.. Would they realy do that. I don't know.<br />
I think Nevalistis summed this up quite well: This is one of the biggest misconceptions we have, and I genuinely wish we could permanently clear it up. I'll provide a few hypothetical situations (mind you, these numbers are ENTIRELY made up).<br />
<br />
Let's say 90% of botters were compromised accounts. This means that 90% of these botters aren't paying accounts; they're stolen accounts, which are generally fueled by stolen credit cards. These payments usually get disputed and taken back, which actually costs us money. If we're looking to make a purely fiscal observation, it makes no financial sense to let these continue (aside from the fact that we don't like compromised accounts to begin with - we want our players to be playing their own accounts safely and enjoyably).<br />
<br />
Let's go on the other side of the fence and say 90% of these botters were otherwise legitimate players paying for their accounts, as you purport. When players bot, other players are inconvenienced by this behavior (and trust me, you guys outnumber the botters, even if you may feel it's the other way around). The inconveniences range from normal players having difficulty farming on their own to struggling to keep up with an economy that's being forcibly fluctuated via unfair advantage. When players are inconvenienced in this manner, they submit petitions. <br />
<br />
Every petition submitted goes to a Game Master for review. A living, breathing person that is paid to provide customer service looks over it, does what's necessary for the situation (in botting cases, usually forwarding the info on to our exploitation/hacks team), and provides a response. Let's say 1-2 people are inconvenienced by a single botter (in all likelihood, we probably get many more petitions per botter than that). This would mean each botter is inconveniencing at least as many, and likely more, players that are positive to the community (the kinds of players we like and want to continue to play our game). For each botter we allow to continue botting, we potentially stand to lose more than we gain for a single subscription, just out of the sheer inconvenience it causes other players.<br />
<br />
Even if you change those numbers around of legitimate players versus compromised accounts - we only stand to lose more if we don't take action on bots (which we do, regularly).<br />
<br />
And that's probably the problem. If I can stand in front of a guy who's botting who has about as many achievement points as me, then the only reason why he dares to bot is because he does not feel there is a risk of losing anything by doing so.<br />
<br />
And the worst part is that right now it's difficult to say that he isn't right.<br />
Those who choose to believe they are above detection range far and wide, I’m sure. Possibly because they may have been getting away with it for a time. However, we investigate every single bot report that comes in. We don't usually deal with the reports immediately because the underlying issue would remain in place. <br />
<br />
What we do is study the bots, see exactly how they do what they do, and fix it so that they don’t work anymore. Once we’ve applied the fix, then the ban waves take place. By doing it like this, we can also come up with better methods of detection, and devise systems that are more effective against bot detection and removal.<br />
<br />
Having said that, it's an on-going fight. Botters develop new bots by working out what we detected and fixed, and it starts all over again. In the process, we’ve ruled out one way of cheating the system though. I can’t go into much more detail without providing botters with information that would help them (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/242016-captcha-to-report-and-automagically-disconnect-botters/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5724064668?page=4#70))<br />

Warrior Tanking Feedback<br />
would like to know what about it you like over the cataclysm model.<br />
Getting rage when you use your abilities and not when you get hit and not being constantly at max rage. <br />
Cata felt a bit spammy, constantly hitting cleave or heroic strike to spend rage was not my favourite thing. This got to the point where some players simply macro’ed HS to devastate because it was out of the GCD and still rarely got rage starved.<br />
<br />
I’m really enjoying tanking with my warrior right now, I did enjoy it in Cata as well I must say, but it’s just better now, revenge and shield slam feel great, and you can use the rage that they generate for when you really need to minimize damage taken, or, if you feel confident about your survivability you can use that rage with offensive abilities like heroic strike, but it’s the decision making process that I enjoy, rage doesn’t feel free anymore, you actually have to think and make a trade-off, or even predict when you need to save more rage and build it up for a moment where you know it would be effective and efficient to use a mitigation cooldown like shield barrier or shield block, that’s just good design in my opinion.

Questing<br />
Remove class specific quest rewards? When none of the items are an upgrade, I would always chose the one that sells for most <br />
They are all worth the same amount now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261847091696005120))<br />
<br />
About questing in a raid group: I'm probably missing something, but what is problematic about people forming &quot;questing raids&quot;? <br />
It is so efficient that it would feel mandatory. Every realm would have a continual Golden Lotus raid etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261360432915288065))<br />
<br />
Will we need to be honored with Wrathion or have to have completed the legendary questline to do his new 5.1 questline? <br />
Wrathion's Legendary questline in 5.1 is a continuation of the 5.0 quests, so you'll have to do them all! <br />
<br />
Are you guys happy with the daily system playing such a large role in end-game content? <br />
I think the valor and charms feel good because you can cap them. I think rep itself would be better with a cap. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260775899430010880))<br />
<br />
Are you considering changing the reputation system? So many dailies are burning us down from the game. Tabards back? <br />

Why can I not fly in Silvermoon? I cry every time I go back... <br />
It would take months to fix, which means you'd get less other stuff. Challenging for us to justify. Org hard but still easier. We feel like BEs have been neglected a bit lately. We won't forget them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261655186521612290))<br />
<br />
The problem for me is that it's one of the situations you talk a lot about avoiding; taking an existing toy away from players. (Loss of increased running speed as a ghost)<br />
It's often easy to make players happy in the short term but not the long term, even though the latter is more important. <br />

Instead of lying or just flat out being delusional - he admits to a fault blizzard has. He says they can be slow getting stuff out, which we all know is the case. Why are they already talking about the next expansion, like MoP is some kind of after thought of an expansion.Oh god, just stop. It's not a fault, Blizzard is the one who started the joke &quot;soon&quot;. Stop trying to pounce on anything you can to hold over your head as a banner for every quibble you have with the game. They have ALWAYS been working on the next expansion at the moment the new expansion comes out, how else do you think they manage to get them out 2 years at a time? You have no freaking clue it seems what goes on behind the scenes, so don't be so quick to criticize.<br />

Poossibly WoW: the emerald dream, then wrap it up. Or is it to soon?If you think WOW will ever be wrapped up while having 10 million subs, you need to get an education. And the Emerald Dream was dealt with in a book and the Cata Teldrassil quest chain. We may visit it for something, but it's not going to have it's own expansion without a lot of brand new lore. But you seem to absurdly think Blizzard isn't capable of new lore if you think anything is being wrapped up.</div></div><hr />

Ok for one there's always been groups of people that leave after the first month of an expansion. Second, the number of people who don't like this expansion is so ridiculously small it's unbelievable. It's been received at least as well as WotLK if not better. Third, WoW could drop down to 2m players and it would still be profitable for them to produce new content for it. For them to not make another expansion something extremely drastic would have to happen which just plain hasn't. Finally, pretty much every returning player I've talked to is in love with this expansion so far, I would not be surprised if the sub count stays above 10m even with annual pass ending this month for most people.</div></div><hr />

Since there wasn't one this year, and the fact that I think they will be releasing xpac 5 faster then mop. Guessing on a March or April 2014 xpac 5 release date. So maybe it should be in August, since there have been 2 Blizzcons in August before. June is just wishful thinking I guess, but I definitely think Blizzcon will be before October.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzcon 2013 will announce wow expansion 5, what diablo expansion 1 will be, and hopefully Titan.<br />

Too soon. I think we've got two expansions left. 95 then 100. I don't think they'll increase level cap past 100.<br />
<br />
90-95 may be a demon expansion with love for Outland.

And why wouldn't they increase level cap past 100 (or release more expansions for that matter) they even said so themselves a lot of times now, as long as people are playing the game, they will keep making expansions.</div></div><hr />

EQ is actually coming out with its 19th expansion soon, Rain of Fear. They've released 1-2 expansions per year since 1999. As for subscribers, I believe they've been solid at around 80k for the last 2-3 years.<br />

<br />
Disgraceful excuses? Do you have any idea what they'd need to do to let you fly there? It's not just flipping a switch.<br />
<br />
The whole zone would need to receive revamp treatment, which would take months like he said, from the artists and the designers to the people that implement the changes plus tons of internal testing to make sure there aren't odd spots or problems while flying, and nothing that looks strange from the air. Then it would go on the PTR for public testing and any problems there would have to be addressed.<br />
<br />
So please don't spout off like you think they're holding something easily fixed back from you. It's not like they're doing it out of spite, they want to focus their attentions on something else. A zone without flying but that otherwise functions is no reason to go back and spend all that time fixing it just so the few people that actually populate the place can get around a little faster. I'm sure one day it will be fixed, but I would rather they worked on new raids, quests, and other new things then implementing flying in one little zone to make a few whiners happy.<br />

<br />
It's not so much of a mindless grind if people stop clearing content in the first week.<br />
<br />
And there's MUCH more to the game besides raiding.<br />
<br />
I've been playing for over 5 years and I can honestly say I've not had any issues with raid grinding purely because I've always been in social raiding guilds.<br />
We might not get the heroics cleared but we certainly have fun throughout the whole expansion, which is what the game should be about.<br />

No, not the lichking again. The longer the storylines around him lasted the less logical they got(new Naxx, dks, the role of the undead, a dragon fire burned dude who should be dead and becomes new lichking...no idea how he even got there in that exact moment). Arthas was great as the big evil lurking somewhere in the north during classic and BC...the finish in wotlk was epic, but the story telling was really questionable and I don't need to add another chapter to that one with a burning lichking sitting on an ice throne....really not.</div></div><hr />

It's possible we will engage Sargeras as the end boss, but I see the victory over him being merely a setback. :-J<br />
<br />
*Also to note, I don't think MoP was planned from the beginning. I think it was more or less jammed in to help extend the life of the game postponing any eventual &quot;ultimate raid boss fights&quot;. To that end, I think they have known about and been working on the next Xpac in some limited form or another for a while now. I really enjoy see Rob's unsolicited excitement about the upcoming Xpac. I can imagine with 11:30 time stamp (guessing time zone) that he just got out of a big meeting about it and is really stoked. I could be fooled admittedly, but I think we are seeing some honest excitement and emotions about what's coming out soon ™</div></div><hr />

They've always planned a couple of expansions ahead. When Wrath came out they were already working on parts of Cataclysm and planning MoP. So I guess Wrath wasn't as good as people thought, let alone TBC.</div></div><hr />

Mwah, doubt it. I think they want to do something about Plate intellect gear, since at the moment only one spec of one class has any benefit from it at all which are holy palas. Either it goes out the window entirely or we get another plate class that can use plate int gear. Perhaps a hybrid plate caster? Ranged dps / healing specs. Would be rather interesting to see how they'd balance it though.<br />

I suppose you are right, just like they would never have petless locks...oh wait, I just found out they recently introduced shadow priests into the game. Seems quite unpossible as they could never have 2 classes that do similar things in different ways amirite? /end_sarcasm<br />
<br />
You calling a ranger a petless hunter would be like calling a Rogue a plateless Warrior or a DK a Bloodlustless Shaman...or Shadow Priests a petless Lock. I don't understand what the hangup you are seeing is.<br />

<br />
This is basically what I was thinking was that it would have to be ranged with the last 2 being melee, and considering there are already 5 classes in the game that are spell damage ranged vs 1 class that is physical damage ranged, I'm guessing a 2nd physical damage ranged class is next in line. That said I am guessing mostly out of what I wish to see versus having any evidence. To be honest I tend to agree with you as well, that before we see a new class, I would prefer to see a 4th talent option for all classes that at the very least would add a healing and/or tanking tree to all classes.</div></div><hr />

MoP is good, but a handful of design decisions is tainting the overall experience. Most notably the focus on daily quests. Being given the option to do daily quests is great, and getting valor points from dailies is a good change. Being forced to do daily quests to not get partially locked out of other (entirely unrelated) content is a horrible change. The most glaring being the requirement to farm reputations through dailies to spend valor, even if you gained that valor through dungeons or raiding. They basically took away the valor system from raiders and said they could have it back, but only if you do dailies. Changing the &quot;daily&quot; heroics back from seven per week to one per day (with half the reward for subsequent ones) was also a step backwards, as it once again rewards simply being able to play every day (rather than total effort invested).<br />
<br />
Bring back reputation tabards with the addition that you can't earn loot while wearing them, and the &quot;get both loot and rep from dungeons&quot; issue is solved, while giving people the option to earn reputations by other means than daily quests.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a fanboy, I quit the game often because I dislike the direction it's gone to. I quit in 4.2 and 4.3 because they were terrible content patches, for example.<br />
<br />
MoP is an absolutely stellar expansion from nearly all stand points (I don't PvP, so I can't judge there). It has incredible Raid, dungeon and quest content. Tons of new time and gold sinks, upgrades to professions, some of the best artwork ever seen.<br />
<br />
You're simply hung up on the fact that there are pandas in the game and are too narrow minded to see how little they actually effect anything in the game, seriously, replace them with the model of any humanoid and almost nothing else would need to be altered to fit.</div></div><hr />

What exactly are you locked out of? Other dailies that you complain you don't like. With the removal of reputation requirements for the valor gear, dailies now are 100% optional.<br />

Essentially your solution to the problem is to go back to the old system where people bitched about doing nothing but sitting in SW/Org waiting for dungeons. <br />

I wonder why this little change-up came in? This could be good-even though Pardo was involved back in the day, I'd like to think the guy might have ideas of what would help freshen WoW up again somewhat, while not dropping a bunch of subs like Cata did. MoP gained a little chunk back, but I guess we'll find out what the yearly subs running out did soon enough(I think in a week we get the reports.) <br />

after you reached lvl 90 you can ask a pandaren to transfer you to the new cont(in)ent for the cost of 30 levels. your reward will be an all new talent tree and 500 new pets (can only choose 3).<br />
<br />

His whole deal is that something big is coming and the Horde and Alliance need to stop squabbling and team up for it. Culminating with the end of Garrosh and the Horde finally getting their shit together internally, the next expansion will most likely be this big threat Wrathion keeps hinting at. My money is on the Legion, as many of you are also speculating. I also wouldn't be surprised if this next expansion has the Outland revamp they kept saying they wanted to do eventually, after the Azeroth revamp in Cata happened. <br />
This would also be a good time to bring Illidan back, which they seem to be hinting at doing, as well.</div></div><hr />

They always start development of the next expansion as soon as the current one is released.<br />
<br />
Otherwise they'd have their concept artists, composers, cinematics team, etc. just sitting around on their hands for months and months waiting to go back to work.<br />

Emerald Dream is wrapped in lore afaik, I would put a decent bet on it being something to do with the burning legion's return, we've had so many hints to it now.<br />
Nope. In Stormrage they pushed the corruption into the Rift of Aln but it had already started to overflow again in Cataclysm. There are places in the Barrens and Mt. Hyjal, at the very least, where the Emerald Nightmare is already creeping out into reality again. Plus the Old God responsible for it (N'zoth) is still very much alive.<br />
<br />
I don't know if they'll make the Emerald Dream an entire continent or just some dungeons and a raid, but whatever the case, it's certainly gonna be added to the game eventually.</div></div><hr />

I had no interest in the whole pet battle thing, but while leveling a new monk I gave it a try and found it quite addicting. Goes to show that people with open minds experience a lot more of the world then those who judge a book by it's cover. I feel sorry for those people.</div></div><hr />

I don`t want to ruin your picture about what is childish and what not, but the elves and dragons are part of the human mythology and they are pretty ancient stuff: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin<br />
Not even the Pandas are childish (even if I do not really like them) because in the Eastern cultures animal heroes are pretty common (1 of the most known is the Monkey King http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong)</div></div><hr />

Other dailies that you complain you don't like. With the removal of reputation requirements for the valor gear, dailies now are 100% optional.<br />
<br />
Essentially your solution to the problem is to go back to the old system where people bitched about doing nothing but sitting in SW/Org waiting for dungeons. <br />
<br />
Blizzard honestly cannot win.<br />
They only removed the rep requirements for JP gear and not Valor gear. I don't mind the daily quests but I think overall the content of MoP is sound but when everything is tainted with cheap time wasting tricks like larger than normal (but not challenging) mob health pools and no spirit flying and bags filling up at a ridiculous rate requiring time to micro manage and the enjoyment does become tainted. Hell. most of the ideas to bring back World PvP seem to have backfired at least on my server as most people just want to finish what they are doing and don't have the time or energy to get into PvP leaving me having had two World PvP battles in this xpac that was supposed to bring it back. When people complained about a lack of content in Cata, Blizzard tossed everything they had into this xpac, unfortunately that includes mundane time sinks everywhere for no reason other than to slow us down.</div></div><hr />

I can honostly say that I have never heard anybody complain about no spirit flying and bags filling up. Lol. And about the time wasting 'tricks'. You know you're playing a video game right? That in itself is wasting time. Gee, there are things in the game that you can do over and over, and somehow that is a 'trick'? I think the tricks on you for thinking that playing a video game is anything other then a 100% waste of time.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't seem like it is directed toward hardcore players or casuals, but more so for everyone. Also, what kind of systems do they have in place that keeps people from camping the npc's that start the events? For instance...so and so is in a party with someone who is doing the brawler's guild, so he just stands there and starts the matches for them. I'm interested, because on paper this brawler's guild sounds awesome, but does it actually work? You must put in the variable that players are dicks most of the time.</div></div><hr />

Yep from what I saw it's pretty much get 3 of every pet you can find and show off your big numbers...<br />
<br />
<br />
Also someone mentioned that they never heard of complaints about bag space and not being able to fly in ghost form...there have been tons of complaints about these things, nothing game breaking but when you die eg: in jade forest at the dragon faction and you get ported up to a pillar with a gy on it and the only way to get down because of silly coast placement is to &quot;force&quot; spawn then that's a bit silly.<br />

After an expansion mainly based around Pandas and the pretty uninspired Monk class, almost anything will sound amazing. <br />
(No, don't even start telling me how stupid I am and how fantastic Pandaria is: rather try and talk about it to any non WoW-fanboy above 14y/o and he will tell you that the very concept is childish and lame. And no, don't tell me that we already have elves and orcs: not every fantasy element is equally childish or lame, there's lots of fantasy that more mature audiences appreciate, but it does not involve pansy pandas...). <br />
<br />
Bring the Burning Legion back, please.<br />
<br />
Ask most people above the age of 14 and they'll tell you that playing video games, let alone MMORPGs where you socialize with anonymous people on the internet, is childish/lame, whether it involves pandas, elves, demons, etc. What's your point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
An interview recently did state that MoP wasn't their original planned expansion. I imagine they did this early in the design process, but I feel like the Legion expansion was supposed to be the next one, and this Warlock/BT stuff was going to be in the expansion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heltoray</div><div class="date">2012-10-29, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and here I thought Blizzard would announce their next expansion to be shit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">docwyrick</div><div class="date">2012-10-29, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am fairly certain the legendary, Wrathion quest chain will be the most insightful piece of information regarding the future of Azeroth. The direction of this quest chain will show us what our next expansion will be. Blizzard seems hell bent on making him a huge player in the shaping of the world going forward. With that being said, I would love to see the Burning Legion return. I think it is safe to say that the majority of the players do not care whats next, as long as it truly seems epic. To me, again I think most would agree, the return of the Legion seems as epic and as grand of an event that there could be. You stave of the legion once and it almost ruined two worlds, only to have them come back stronger AND with their leader, the most powerful and most feared entity known in the universe.<br />
<br />
Blind faith tells me there is something larger about this whole Garrosh thing at the end of the xpac. I think we will see something we were not expecting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea its funny.<br />
<br />
The next thing we'll hear is blizzard telling the gamers that it's there fault MoP lost so many million subscribers cause we over-hyped the game.<br />
<br />
Nothing like blizzard starting the hype train years in advance. Leaves them room to blame the gamers later.</div></div><hr />

Titan will be talked about alot next 2 years. Soon after Cata launched BLizzard put quite a bit of press out about Titan and got huge stick when 4.1 launched with 2 rewamped dungeons. At the same time press articles were saying many WOW devs had moved on to Titan and WOW sub money was used to cover the design cost of Titan.<br />
<br />
This time around... they are trying to make it look like they are not just thinking Titan. Its mostly PR tho - and everyone with half a braincell knows it.</div></div><hr />
