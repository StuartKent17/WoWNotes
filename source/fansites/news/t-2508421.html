Harvest Festival Live Through September 17th<br />
The Harvest Festival is now live until Septmber 17th on both retail and classic WoW. This quest is fairly easy (using an item at each fallen idol's resting place) and rewards a whopping 6600 experience in classic so it's a good one to do before it ends!<br />
The yearly Harvest Festival is now underway in Azeroth. This is a solemn time when the Alliance honors Uther the Lightbringer by lighting a candle at his tomb in the Western Plaguelands, while members of the Horde show their respect to Grommash Hellscream by leaving a bottle of spirits at the base of the Hellscream Memorial in Demon Fall Canyon in Ashenvale.<br />
<br />
When: September 10-17<br />
Where: Outside Ironforge and Orgrimmar<br />
<br />
Commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives to help friends and allies. Feasts are also held outside Ironforge and Orgrimmar in honor of these fallen heroes.<br />
<br />

Did it yesterday. Mythic Ashvane is heroic difficulty now. That nerf was HUGE and completely unnecessary.</div></div><hr />
