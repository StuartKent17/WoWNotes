<br />
Warmode and the Future of wPvP - Incentives<br />
We hope to have War Mode up very soon for everyone to try out. Until then, I’ll outline a few details:<br />
<br />
Honor Talents enabled<br />
As mentioned by Ion and others, Honor Talents are on permanently while War Mode is enabled in the outdoor world. This was the case in Legion as well, but they would only enable when you got into “PvP combat” causing them to enable and disable while playing which ended up feeling a bit “janky.” Players may also find some added benefit with Honor Talents against normal PvE creatures as well, which is designed to be part of a “package of bonuses” to offset the inherit lost efficiency of World PvP. <br />
<br />
Gear scaling<br />
In order to create a fair fights and good gameplay, our goal is to limit the extremes in power between players in War Mode that come from gear and level. We want you to have an advantage if your gear is better, but within reason. The experience should be something similar to Unrated Battlegrounds in Legion (but without the stat templates). Keep in mind this is scaling only in PvP combat, so your power against creatures in the world will remain the same as it would be with War Mode disabled.<br />
<br />
Conquest and World PvP<br />
In Battle for Azeroth you’ll earn conquest for doing PvP activities similar to how it was gained in the past: Rated Arena and Rated Battlegrounds as well as some light conquest from Unrated Battlegrounds. But what’s new is earning conquest from doing World PvP activities. This gives you an additional source when filling up that “conquest bar” for your weekly conquest item.<br />
<br />
Bounty Hunting <br />
How do you earn conquest in World PvP? One source is from killing other players, of course. But the more of the opposing faction you slay, the higher chance they will put a bounty on your head. When a bounty is put on you, it will be announced to all opposing players in the zone and you will appear on the main map for a reward. Good luck!<br />
<br />
And more...<br />
While we have one or two other content features in War Mode we’ll share later on, one of our goals is to keep it minimal. As you point out Ion saying, we want to create a foundation first which we can hopefully build upon (with your feedback!) in the future.</div></div><hr />

Wonder what's keeping somebody from just leaving and coming back real quick with a hearth/flight whistle/whatever. I guess without flying its not that bad, but with flying you could probably just fly over the zone border and back in like 30 seconds</div></div><hr />

That's exactly the idea of war mode ... no more effort spent on special PvP servers etc.<br />
PvP now becomes an optional extra you do, rather than a major choice you made 10 years ago.</div></div><hr />

That wouldn't be true even if you were only talking about MMORPGs. Granted, PVE is generally the main event for MMORPGs, but even then we have a few titles with a fairly significant focus on PVP, like Guild Wars 2 or Black Desert. <br />
<br />
Then you have the other genres of MMOs to consider. For example, Planetside 2 is an MMOFPS, and has no PVE at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im afraid that flying will kill world pvp in bfa :(<br />
<br />
I'm sure that Blizz will disable flying in War Mode, since I don't think it'll work otherwise.</div></div><hr />

if you think its a hassle then dont play in pvp mode, where is your problem ? <br />
this change is for people that don't think that open pvp is a hassle but rather that its the fun gameplay they want.</div></div><hr />

Or to add onto this, they could just join another group finder group and get immediately phased. Maybe the bounty 'debuff' could persist through phasing</div></div><hr />

<br />
and you are allowed to think your thoughts too :P I haven't set foot in a raid this expansion, I'd rather more pvp focus! :P <br />
<br />
different things for diff people and that's ok, we should be supporting one another. because when the game gets better, it gets better for everyone. asking for less dev time for X because you don't enjoy it isn't productive :P if world pvp works from this and takes off, brings back a bunch of players, that is more players in the world. making smaller realms feel bigger, its more players for raids and pugs, and its more subs which means more continued development. <br />
<br />
the thing with the bounty system for me is, as with many systems which sound great on paper, there will always be those lowlives who exploit it.. as mentioned. flying out, hearthing, xrealm grouping etc.. there will always be SOME douchey way to exploit things. there is only SO much blizz can do to fight it.</div></div><hr />

They might make it that if you end up with a bounty on your head, you are unable to fly away..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like the WQ in legion maybe it could lead to a few groups being made and having some fun battles in certain zones. I like the idea of the bounty hunt system, ill never be a bounty I suck too much but it would make skilled pvpers have something else to focus on maybe.<br />
<br />
Im all for giving new ideas a try and I do miss world pvp from whe I started wow many years ago so this for me is a welcome addition</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea of PVE was to make you more powerful for PVP. Thats what MMO's have always been about. Since the days of the first MMORGP The Realm Online (Which i played) and the legend Ultima Online. PVP goes hand in hand with MMO's. <br />
<br />
Its not skill to beat AI, its skill to beat another thinking person. Thats why eSports are about facing other people and not AI.</div></div><hr />

I don't get what the problem is with the PVP haters, you're not forced to take part so stay out of it. Want something removed cause you're not into it. Just ridiculous mentality. I don't care for raiding but I'm not asking blizzard to remove it.</div></div><hr />

Nothing will be ever be enough to warrant hassle-free gameplay in PvP.<br />

You can lower the hassle a bit but never erase it. Only making every combat last 5 minutes minimum would discourage gankers, but they will never make it so because gameplay wise would be a nightmare.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this, it will allow those who need flying to gain access to it while at the same time keeping the damage it causes to Wpvp out of war mode. It's a win win, but you just know some jackass is going to make a 3 pages long post about how he deserves to get the benefits of pvp while not having to actively be a part of it.</div></div><hr />

It's a win win, but you just know some jackass is going to make a 3 pages long post about how he deserves to get the benefits of pvp while not having to actively be a part of it.<br />
They can write a book for all I care! Now I am definately not one for pvping in general, but even I must admit that the bounty system and Warmode (only tog'able in cities btw!) has me really interested. Some of my most fondest memories is in SWG beign a pikeman (wit a nasty mind bleed pike) BH hunting Jedi's! This BH system brings in a whole ton of possibilities and even more fun than you can shake a stake at. Let me propose the following:<br />
<br />
The one with the bounty on him, should get a reward for staying alive in the world, and not chicken out and heart stone home. The longer he/she is out there the greater the reward, and let the reward be diminished if he's grouped, to entice that desperado feeling. Rewards could be money per 10 min, and if you survive long enough a title like &quot;Notorius&quot;, &quot;Wanted DOA&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Man I for one can't wait to see what Blizzard will make out of it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Less tank damage - as in WAY LESS - is a good idea in both PvE and PvP. But it is imperative in PvP.<br />
<br />
Agreed, and if I remember correctly, then Blizzard actually talked about tanks in pvp in one of the Q&amp;A's. I think they were nerfing their damage soaking abilities substantially, which is sorely needed because no dps will ever be able to take down a Blood Dk or Guardian Druid in any reasonable amount of time - if ever.</div></div><hr />

WoW is not a professional e-sport, and it never will be. It's a niche game, with a niche crowd... this is coming from a guy who loves watching wow Arena. I was at Blizzcon cheering on CDew to avoid 0-4 in the finals of 2016. Trying to balance classes is honorable, but part of the game is finding combinations of classes and abilities that work and offset other popular comps. The desire to &quot;make everyones gear the same&quot; in pvp, has pushed away a huge enthusiast part of the pvp scene. People like me who would sit in bg's for fun progressing our power via gear upgrades specific to pvp. I get why you did it Blizzard, I think we all do. I think there were many people crying out about being weak in pvp situations the once or twice a month they decided to engage in them. Where has implementing this gotten us? Is there more participation or less? Is wow a major esport watched by &quot;normies&quot; outside of the wow world? It's time to go back to the roots, the only failure now, is to carry on with it's implementation.</div></div><hr />

They want to make changes to Wpvp to make it more engaging and intense, having people just stay in the air hovering over players until they engage something in combat is the exact opposite of that. Feel free to go check out the operation murloc pvp world quest in azsuna while in a LFG group, there's a 80% chance at least two players will just be hovering and waiting for the points to rack up. Removing flying would go a massive way in terms of accomplishing what they appear to be going for.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they dont want people having over 3 times the health and kill someone literally with one spell/global? You still have an advantage but that might be too hard for you to understand</div></div><hr />

Some people just can't pvp if they are not able to devastate the opponent due to gear, while having little to no skill. Remember AV in vanilla as a hunter or mage in Tier2 plus just multi/one shotting opponents all day long at the grave yards, no skill required, just tab and shoot and tab and shoot untill you ran out of arrows or got one shotted yourself eventually. Not exactly fun for the opponents or specifically rewarding for the player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This means that war mode will probably become even rarer since most people will run PVE mode to find M+ and raid groups in the premade tab. Yeah, you can always just go back to your capital and toggle it when you want to M+/PVP, but that's usually more trouble than it's worth.<br />

Honestly they really need to let both modes be combined when searching for instanced content in the premade tab.</div></div><hr />

Wonder what's keeping somebody from just leaving and coming back real quick with a hearth/flight whistle/whatever. I guess without flying its not that bad, but with flying you could probably just fly over the zone border and back in like 30 seconds<br />

But I guess that tehy will only remove flight from the ones that get a bounty on then -- until the bounty is removed of couse. But flying mount combat would be awesome...</div></div><hr />

I do have some concerns. Stealth is either going to be OP or useless, I don't see a real middle ground there. I'm also worried that if you have a bounty on you its going to be a rare instance where you are actually in a 1v1 or 2v1 situation. I imagine people are in a zone the bounty pops up and everyone in the zone B-lines it to gank the bounty. I'm thinking something like the buff from the Black Rook PVP WQ might be useful. Also Tanks will need to be tuned down in some fashion.</div></div><hr />

Stealth depends on the handling. For me stealth should be worthwhile, in the form that instead of a red arrow over your head (not literally, but a non stealth person is targetable quite some way off), a stealthed bounty should be shown on the map where in the precinity the bounty is located, down to the size of for instance one of those farm areas that exists in western plaguelands. That way a stealthy bounty still has way's of hideing and moving, but it's not a get out of jail free card.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Woooops, you just went full retard, never go full retard like that.<br />
<br />
1) mmos were originally either more about pvp than pve (like DAoC, where all pve content was gated behind pvp that gave access to bosses/ zones/ability points), or evenly both (EQ)<br />
<br />
2) there still are today a lot of PvP oriented MMOs and they work, they just dont meet as much success as wow because a) cutting between pvp and pve cuts half your player base, even though it makes those who stay more loyal, b)they dont have 15 years of dev, so players are out of content faster (ESO / WO we're looking at you)<br />
<br />
3)PvP is the sole activity of a good chunk of the player base, and a common fill up for most of it, with people never doing any pvp content of any kind being the exception rather than the norm, so it's normal for them to pump out content for their player base, and it's actually a nice touch to try and merge the communities, they are giving pve players incentive to try pvp, as pvpers have had incentives to try pve for the past 14 years.<br />
<br />
4) PvP is a daunting challenge both in term of dev and gameplay, because as a player you're not facing a scripted encounter, and as a dev you have to make it so asymetrically different classes and specs stand a chance against some of the others in the biggest, strangest rock paper scissors you could imagine, in a world at war with opposing faction it can also be one of the main story driving force.<br />
<br />
5)you want your community to have really strong ties between them ? you have them work together. look at AQs opening, or life on every realm before fly/summon stone /groupfinder-raidfinder. back in vanilla you would know every max level player on your realm. now you dont even know every member of your guild, and the people you group with outside of your friend list, you find with group finder and will never see/talk/play with them ever again. look at Eve Online, or DAoC large scale stuff is what knits a community together. so perhaps we cant go back to the former realms, where we were &quot;few&quot; enough that you could have nemeses on the other faction, but having world pvp as a meaningful content you can opt for makes sense. <br />
<br />
it's fun to design, fun to play, drives the story and makes the players play together and against one another<br />
<br />
// small edit : i'm a pve player, only ever played pvp to get my prestige 15 bear form, and i sure as hell will be trying to get bounties on my head for the fun of it \\</div></div><hr />
