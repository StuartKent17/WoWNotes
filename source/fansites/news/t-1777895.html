Patch 6.2 - Legendary Ring Concerns<br />
Watcher responded to some concerns about the new legendary rings coming in Patch 6.2 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=19890&amp;filter-quality=32&amp;filter-slot=2048).<br />
Let me try to address a few of the concerns raised in the thread and explain our thinking.<br />
<br />
First off, why this wacky raidwide effect? Why not a traditional legendary that is purely individual? The idea's origins lie in what this particular legendary is: a ring. It's not a weapon designed to strike foes, or a shield to protect you from harm. And what is the nature of a ring? Whether we're talking about seven rings for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, about Captain Planet, or about common social covenants in our own societies, rings tend to be paired with counterparts, and to have their meaning derived from the connections entailed therein. A lot of fluff, perhaps, but that's what got us thinking along the lines of a group effect rather than a personal one. This certainly isn't a template for all future legendaries, but we find it very fitting for this particular one.<br />
<br />
Now, some of the concerns that have been voiced:<br />
<br />
1) &quot;It will be used mechanically on cooldown&quot;<br />
<br />
Sometimes, sure - it depends on the fight. The healing/tank versions certainly won't be used that way, and the DPS ring also has elements (notably the AoE explosion at the end) that add additional depth to the decision of when to activate it. Let's consider the fights in Foundry, since those are probably more familiar examples than Hellfire, and imagine how the ring might have been put to best use while progressing on a few of those encounters:<br />
<br />
Blast Furnace: Largely wasted if you use it on the pull; you might save the first activation for the second pair of Operators, and then during the second phase you'd aim for windows of Elementalist vulnerability, since that's what matters most. Operator Thogar: Here we run into some unique considerations associated with the explosion. You could activate the ring in advance of a Man-at-Arms wave, getting a damage burn on Thogar while you build up the potential AoE that will go off just in time to alpha-strike the dangerous enemies right as they jump off a train car. Flamebender: If you aren't running into her berserk, the Cinder Wolves are your main concern. You'd probably benefit from waiting until she's at 45 or so Energy, and timing the explosion to get a large head start on the Wolves. Especially on Mythic. Blackhand: Aside from the obvious uses to speed up phase 1 and phase 3, I could see having your initiating player as the person who's about to get knocked up onto a balcony with a fresh wave spawn due, timing the explosion to pretty much erase the whole wave of enemies right as they exit the door on the ledge.<br />
<br />
Now, on something like Gruul, you probably would just use it on cooldown every time. But I'd say Gruul is more the exception than the norm. <br />
<br />
2) &quot;It feels bad to have someone else control my legendary&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a fair point, and I sympathize. Setting aside the fact that when doing any solo content you have complete control over the activation, there is still more control with this legendary than with nearly any of our prior examples. Procs could occur at completely inopportune times, often wasting them entirely, and whether you got lucky and had Xuen's cloak trigger just as a large pack of enemies got clumped together, or whether it fired 10 seconds earlier or later, could drastically alter your total damage on a given encounter. <br />
<br />
At its core, the legendary ring is a raid item - the vast majority of the content and the collection steps take you through raid content - and players who are part of a raid group are by definition cooperating and coordinating to tackle challenges. The rings add another layer to that teamwork. Even outside structured guild raiding, it's neither typical nor tolerated in pickup groups for, say, a mage to use Time Warp to maximize personal damage at the expense of the raid, and I'd be surprised if it's common to see it done with the ring. Now, yes, in Raid Finder, though you also won't generally be seeing raids with tons of ring-wearers, you'll probably see some selfish behavior. But even then, the effect isn't wasted (merely suboptimal), and that action isn't likely to affect the group's success or failure on the encounter as a whole given Raid Finder's tuning.<br />
<br />
3) &quot;The effect isn't fair/balanced and is worse for &lt;my spec&gt; than &lt;other specs&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
True. We could have made a perfectly evenhanded ring effect - something like &quot;Equip: Increases damage and healing done by 10%.&quot; That also would have been very lackluster. Nearly any effect with any depth to it will benefit some more than others so long as our classes/specs have varied strengths and weaknesses. (And we don't feel that class homogenization is the answer, either.) Over the course of a fight, that may amount to a difference of a couple percent damage, if that. Hopefully we continue to make interesting and unusual items, and some of those will favor specs that feel the ring was suboptimal for them.<br />
<br />
How do you address concerns that the design of the ring discourages raids from bringing people who don't have their ring to raids?<br />
There's nothing in particular about the ring's design that discourages raids from bringing people who don't yet have it, as compared to any other type of legendary or any player-power increase. Players without the ring will do some percentage less damage (or healing, or have one fewer tank cooldown) over the course of the fight as a whole, but that's just the nature of any big-power item. It's not really different from the cloaks in Mists, or theoretical alternate versions of the ring that had no group synergy component. I'm sure that later in the expansion there will be guilds and pickup groups that strongly or exclusively prefer people with legendary rings, but that's a social dynamic that's nearly unavoidable with any form of player power progression, whether it's a specific legendary or just item level in general.<br />
<br />
Also, as a separate clarification, I wasn't saying it that it won't be used on the pull. It absolutely will be used on the pull in the vast majority of cases. However, the cooldown is short enough that many other opportunities will arise to be more tactical with its use as the fight goes on, rather than just using it automatically every 2 minutes thereafter.<br />
<br />
Finally, nothing in Hellfire Citadel is being tuned around having the ring. That's a big part of why it is not currently available to use in PTR testing. In Siege of Orgrimmar, many players had their cloaks before they first set foot in the zone on the day of the patch, which somewhat diluted the impact of completing the cloak since those players didn't really get a before-and-after comparison of specific fights once they'd earned it. Cutting edge progress in Hellfire Citadel, on the other hand, will occur without legendary rings in the raid. And then as raid members complete their rings, the power of the legendary will help you overcome Gul'dan's forces.<br />
<br />

<br />
As ancient as Draenor itself, Kormrok once ruled Gorgrond, the creatures of the land slinking away from the giant magnaron's destructive fury. But then the Iron Horde came, trapping the behemoth and attempting to break his will. They were entirely unsuccessful... that is, until the rise of Gul'dan, and the fel power that Kormrok could not resist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - Kormrok periodically jumps to the nearest fel pool of energy, empowering one of his abilities for a short duration depending on which pool he entered.<br />

Flying<br />
You know, last time i told a dev i like something, it was flying. Take a guess what happened short after.<br />
Is your point: I'd like flying back in WoD? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/593681714402045954))<br />
Yes, i really would.<br />
We love feedback, don't be afraid to give it! No one is 'not listening' to you. Sorry if that hasn't been conveyed. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/593682185107832832))<br />
Dont worry. I just would love to see a statement as like &quot;Yes, we bring flying back in 6.2&quot; or &quot;No, we dont bring flying back&quot;.<br />
Specifically, would like to hear what you miss about it! How would you ideally implement it? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/593683023050092544))<br />
I miss the ability to start and stop when i like. Flight pathes take you out of the game.<br />
For me, flying often felt the same. Fly up -&gt; point self in direction -&gt; afk. Agree/disagree? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/593683717840707584))<br />

While I don't interact on Twitter any more i read tweets &amp; forums &amp; appreciate feedback. Thx. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/593650300348604416))<br />
<br />
are the tombstones near the grave yard, and the cart on ruins intended to no longer provide LOS? They worked last patch<br />
They were broken by 6.1. We tried to hotfix them in a number of ways but they were all problematic. Fixed in 6.2. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/594527067095502848))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Big debate going on; are the players in lore stuck on Draenor or was that changed?<br />
Not by now - after escaping Tanaan and establishing garrisons, it's possible to open other ways home. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/594275309798600704))<br />

It adds NOTHING to raiding by forcing that ring to be raidwide, if you wanted to have it be used in certain situations- hey players can decide that themselves- much like we already delay/save dps CDs for specific things... All you're achieving by making it a raidwide use is butchering the story and the individual players earned &quot;legendary&quot; item. Remove the god damned raid wide stupid thing and let players decide if they want to use it coordinated as a group or only 5 at a time, or only 3 or only 8- or all if needed... this thing is putting me off raiding all together!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got nothing to do with &quot;special snowflake&quot;, doesn't bother me at all that everyone has it- Except as it is now only 1 in 20 people will &quot;have it&quot; because it just turns into another Bloodlust...<br />
<br />
I mean how would you feel if Blizzard removed all DPS CD from the game and gave everyone a CD called &quot;MORE DAMAGE&quot; but shared CD with everyone? That's what Blizzard are trying to do with the ring... I play Ret and the dps ring is probably best suited for us in the entire game as of current notes, still doesn't change the fact that some people have 3 min CDs and some have 5-6min CDs.<br />
<br />
As it is now the ring is going to end up being a lot of overkilling adds when 14 dpsers nuke. Same for Healers- use the ring + a Tranq and then theres nothing to heal for the next 15 seconds?<br />
<br />
However if the ring was personal you could decide as a player or raid when and how many rings you'd want/need to get through the next challenge. Then for ST nuke encounters people with 3 min CDs could decide if they wanted to delay ring or not to line up with their personal CDs. Buuuuut no! Blizzard has to make it special because it's a legendary... and not the good kind of special.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and speaking as Ret- we can line up our CD with the ring 100%, will Rets be balanced around that? What then happens if you don't have the ring or if you do pvp? Are other classes gonna end up being buffed because their spec/class doesn't particularly do well with the ring?<br />
Aside from the &quot;free damage&quot; the raid gains I only see problems with the ring...</div></div><hr />

My response: If you don't know why now, please resign from your job.<br />
There are pages upon pages upon pages. You have a plethora of information to prune.<br />
<br />
If you need MORE information -- go flip burgers at McDonalds as your intellectual capacity seems less than functional.<br />
<br />
But personally, I think they are just baiting people to play longer for more subs. Honestly has *never* been any of their virtues. I think they lack the intellectual honesty to handle an sincere open flying discussion.<br />
<br />
Personally, I say if you want to remove flying -- then make the transport system like GW2 instead. &quot;Instant&quot; flying where you see your guy take off... fade to black... fade back.. land. Done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@Iceberg: there are actual MMORPGs where you can drop stuff on the ground. WoW introduced a &quot;clean floor&quot; behavior, which was fairly strange for many old school RPG and MMORPG ppl. The same goes for holding things; many other games feature that you can hold more than just weapons or shields in your hands. Also that you can &quot;hover&quot; an item when it's on your mouse (like drag and drop). Ultima ONline has tat for example (both: floor and drag and drop).<br />
So to store the token and due to the rules of WoW he had to make &quot;room&quot; for the token to actually use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's nothing in particular about the ring's design that discourages raids from bringing people who don't yet have it, as compared to any other type of legendary or any player-power increase.&quot;<br />
<br />
That comment reeks of clueless. The only legendary it can be compared to is the cloak, which most definitely discouraged raids from bringing people without it, as it had a massive impact on dps. The rest of the legendaries are not an issue since only extremely select people had them and they were obtained very late in the tier, and the ring cannot be compared to the type of player-power increase gained by a simple upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally, nothing in Hellfire Citadel is being tuned around having the ring. That's a big part of why it is not currently available to use in PTR testing. In Siege of Orgrimmar, many players had their cloaks before they first set foot in the zone on the day of the patch, which somewhat diluted the impact of completing the cloak since those players didn't really get a before-and-after comparison of specific fights once they'd earned it. Cutting edge progress in Hellfire Citadel, on the other hand, will occur without legendary rings in the raid. And then as raid members complete their rings, the power of the legendary will help you overcome Gul'dan's forces.<br />
<br />
Interesting, I was wondering why they decided not to give it upon entry this time like they did the cloak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
strongly agree, to be honest all i see is negative feedbacks, evidenced n backed up by biggest sub loss WoW ever experienced, i dont know where the heck they picked up &quot;a lot of positive feedback n other variations&quot;. <br />
<br />
its so unreal they chose to believe people are happy with the way they handle the game :rolleyes: and chose to be delusional n ignore all negative feedbacks when all of them are properly written pieces backed up by players' own experiences, and people agree to all the points listed in the negative feedback threads because they themselves have experienced the same thing too. The negative feedbacks lists are arguments with strong grounds and can stand against blizz blind fanboys challenges, but blizz ignores them n treat them as trolling, :rolleyes::D perfect work there, which ultimately can only lead to one logical consequence, suffer the biggest sub loss ever. Oh wait , less money? dont worry here is a $25 shop mount (NEW CONTENT YAY;)), which could have, and should have been added in the game obtained via faction grinds, like nether rays / cenarion hippogryph / netherdrakes. WoD, poor attempt to copy TBC n failed miserably because of greed, putting the essence of TBC behind $$$STORES$$ and garrisons. And also removed the most awesome feature ever introduced to the game in TBC, flying.</div></div><hr />

If you need MORE information -- go flip burgers at McDonalds as your intellectual capacity seems less than functional.<br />

But personally, I think they are just baiting people to play longer for more subs. Honestly has *never* been any of their virtues. I think they lack the intellectual honesty to handle an sincere open flying discussion.<br />
<br />
Personally, I say if you want to remove flying -- then make the transport system like GW2 instead. &quot;Instant&quot; flying where you see your guy take off... fade to black... fade back.. land. Done. <br />
<br />
I agree with everything here, and I personally like no flying. Thing is there are no less than 3 forums post daily on why people want it back in general topics of their site. I don't agree with those arguments/feeling but if you are not familiar with them by now that is just sad. And they still did not definitively say it will be back or not, so I kinda agree they are just baiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what that blue moron said, basically. During my 7 years of playing this game, I have only ever gone afk whilst flying WHEN FORCED TO USE A DAMNED FLIGHTPATH! Through WOTLK, Cata, MoP, I'd be zipping about and always flying close enough to the ground to spot rares and things going on. I'd fly through Jade Forest in Pandaria and Grizzly Hills or Storm Peaks in Northrend just to enjoy the scenery in combination with the music! And I will always cherish exploring, yes, EXPLORING the remade Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms on the back of my back then favourite mount, the Twilight Drake.<br />
<br />
Getting on a flightpath always felt like I was missing out, that I could fly past something of interest. WoD so far has been an endless string of getting the urge to do something, remembering I can't do it at my own pace and route, and thus losing my surge of motivation.<br />
<br />
With no more flying in current content, we will also never again see zones where some areas can be made JUST for the scenic value. From now on, every virtual inch of each zone must be crammed with mobs and &quot;treasures&quot; and &quot;bonus objectives&quot;. All to satisfy the people with the attention-spans of goldfish and a bigger interest in alt-tabbing to Facebook or Youtube than playing the game. They take the issues and behaviour that flight path travel carries and promotes, and place it on player-controlled flight. It's so dumb that it must be painful to be inside their heads. <br />
<br />
Fucking disgrace.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;legendary&quot;...eh, I hadn't expected much else from a bloody ring. Makes me miss my cape even though it was RNG. Beats just getting another CD for retards to abuse, like TW/BL.</div></div><hr />

The problem is we want to utilize dps cooldowns by stacking them together and we don't have enough control over when this ring proc happens. What will happen most of the time in a raid, is the ring will be blown when your ICDs are low, or when your on-use trinket is still on CD, or when recklessness still has 30 seconds before it's up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's an old mechanic in WoW that could have been better implemented. If you disenchant an item, or mill herbs (for example) with full bags and get more items than you consumed you either delete something from your bags or the extra items are lost.<br />
<br />
E.g, you mill the last of your herbs and get the common pigment and a rare pigment. If your bags are full, the common pigment will take up the slot the herbs did previously, and you don't have any space in your bags for the rare pigment. Unless you delete something from your bags quickly enough, the game will delete the rare pigment when it closes the loot window.<br />
<br />
I haven't bought a WoW token for gold yet, but I think it goes straight into your bags. I assume there's some mechanic that'll check your bags or mail it to you, but the comic is playing with a scenario where it hasn't. He's got the 'loot' window open with the WoWtoken, but he can't 'loot' it because his bags are full.<br />
<br />
So, Narya decides to just 'carry' it to the bank like this. &quot;In game&quot; it shows up as if it's in his hands (Because, how else could he walk around with it right?) instead of a loot window. The in game mechanics require him to delete something from his bags or the loot window will disappear and the token will be destroyed. The comic often plays with the game mechanics by personifying them. In this case, he's apparently defying the in-universe physics/laws. The mechanic, if it existed in real life, defies common sense- which is what the comic is making fun of.<br />
<br />
In any case, he tries to just drop it on the ground (which is what happens in Diablo- in that game the item remains on the ground, and you can drop something else out of your inventory and pick up the original item). Again, items don't exist in WoW. They're either in a loot window or in your inventory (bags, equipped, bank etc.), so again, he's breaking the in-game universal laws and physics.<br />
<br />
The end of the joke is that he finds a compromise. Unwilling to destroy something in his bags, and rather than loose the WoWtoken, he resorts to turning the WoW token into a weapon item, by brutally murdering his beloved WoW pet with it. Now that it's been used as a 'weapon', he can equip it (as equipped weapons and armour don't take up bagspace).<br />
<br />
EDIT: The comic works on a few levels. There's the obvious irony of Narya choosing to beat his pet to death with the very token he bought to feed the pet in the first place. Another level is how ridiculous the game mechanics would be in 'real life', and yet another is poking fun at how crude and PITA the WoW inventory system is compared to others (such as Diablo).<br />

<br />
Out of curiosity, what classes do you play? I started out as a druid back in Vanilla, where druids and shamans were essentially mana batteries first and second/third rate healers second. Sure, I pushed the button, but when Priest #3 types out &quot;Need innervate&quot;, he was the one deciding to use my ability. The same was more or less of Shamans- an assistant raid lead would swap a shaman into the healer group to drop his mana totem when it was decided the priests needed mana.<br />
<br />
It hasn't really changed- a tank calls out for an external from the healers, the raid leader chooses which player to resurrect with a Battle rez, a player is told not to resurrect (Soulstone or Shaman Ank) because the ressurection should be saved for a tank, a hunter is ordered to pop Aspect of the Fox, or a druid is ordered to pop Stampeding Roar etc. etc.<br />
<br />
How is this any different than a mage deciding to pop timewarp, and depriving the shaman from using Bloodlust when his Cooldowns are up?</div></div><hr />

So basically... It's now officially confirmed that WoD is pretty much a useless filler expansion and a complete waste of time in-universe as well?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-05-11, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to the comic, I bought a token and tried to put it in my bank. Kept getting the error message that it couldn't go into that container. So even if Narya made it to the bank, it couldn't go into it. It's stuck in your bags. The better option would have been to just use it and add the time to his account right there. No explanation was given in regards to why he didn't unless he had another engagement elsewhere in the real world that would have caused him to lapse his account briefly. Possible the author of the comic was unaware of this, though, since a good many don't seem to be aware that tokens can't go into the bank.<br />
<br />
In regards to legendaries in void storage, you can't put unique items into void storage which includes legendaries.<br />
<br />
In regards to the ring itself and not finishing the chain due to the proc, you can buy current and previous stages of the ring. You can finish the quest chain and get your legendary, then go back and buy the previous stage with the self buff on it ... I think. Honestly, I only have the healer and the caster rings which are the same level. I finish the quest and get my caster ring, then go buy the healer one. Before I buy the healer one, I have 2 rings of different levels but they're also technically two different rings. More than likely, to get the previous version, you'll have to destroy or vendor your legendary ring, but it's possible it might let you buy the previous one without doing so. You just can't equip it with the legendary.<br />
<br />
I find the use effect for a legendary stupid, too, but I don't see many offering an alternative proc. Personally, I wouldn't mind a little healer that throws out healing for 10-20 seconds every 1 or 2 minutes when healing and also restores like 25% of my mana when up. No idea on DPS or tanking. But since Blizzard seems to have their fingers in their ears going &quot;nah nah nah nah, I don't hear you&quot;, I don't see them listening even to really good alternative procs. They're dead set on whatever it is they're doing regardless of what the players themselves want.</div></div><hr />

To me AFK is get up from the computer and go make a sandwhich...go to the bathroom...put the clothes in the dryer...etc. If I even though of AFKing while on a flying mount. I'd either end up in fatigue land, way far past where I was going to stop, or hit a tree and went no where. <br />
<br />
AFK to me isn't hit auto&quot;run&quot; and then sit there and watch while the flying mount moves. It amazes me how people like Muffins get these good paying jobs but have little to know common sense or brains...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is factually incorrect. But I figured someone would try that. I searched through several pages of threads before finding one that talked about that tweet. And there were no other recent threads at the time otherwise talking about the question muffin posted in his tweet or whether or not it would or should be introduced in 6.2. So when I finally found that one I posted in it. So apparently Blizz is just deleting any threads asking about flying in 6.2.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? Such a MINIMAL percentage of this drop quit because of no flying. Don't be stupid. There are people that actually play the game you know. There aren't many casual players that only play to do dailies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not so much the flying, it's lack of acknowledgement that they aren't listening to the community. <br />
<br />
I just don't get why the Dev Team is so concerned that players play the game they way they want us to play it instead of giving us the tools to play the game WE want to play it. It shouldn't matter if players play the way you envisioned or not, what should matter is if they play at all and for how long they play it. If all you do is cut out options for players they they will either stop playing or play less.<br />
<br />
I just hope these lead developers are willing to put their jobs on the line for their &quot;envisioned player experience&quot; because if they keep going down this path and WoW looses another 1-2m subs the next quarter you can bet they won't be lead designers anymore.</div></div><hr />
