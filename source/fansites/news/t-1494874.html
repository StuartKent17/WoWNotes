<br />
I just wonder how it'll work ingame... I assume they'll just make two bikes and we'll vote for our favorite model and then that'll be a faction neutral bike ingame. Can't imagine a Horde themed bike make it into the game and only Horde can ride it, or the Alliance ride it too. Or they'll give the winning model a skin for either faction.<br />
<br />
Again, gonna be interesting to see how this goes and if the Alliance team actually makes the sweet'er ride so I'll have to vote for them. :P</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has been doing cancerous things since wotlk. Now this. They've sold out big time and this cancerous garbage is the nail the coffin.<br />
<br />
Also a ploy of getting new players to join, which is the main source of blizzards subs. Now they're targeting older people, do you know who watches that channel? Jesus, the world is ending sooner that I had thought.</div></div><hr />

(But they porobably didn't so I'm fine with it.)<br />
<br />
Oh and I totally expect this to be a store mount so I won't vote or watch (microtransactions don't belong into WoW).<br />
<br />
Until they confirm a craft / quest / drop mount I don't want anything to do with this.</div></div><hr />

That seems unlikely though since the chopper model has been around since Wrath.<br />
<br />
Turning this into a faction v faction thing was a bad choice though. This will come down to faction pride over anything else, which kind of undermines the idea of the coolest bike winning.</div></div><hr />

You bet your ass it is.<br />
<br />
Since their removing flying for some ungodly amount of time, blizzard has to sell something that stays only on the ground. Can't really keep selling flying mounts can they?<br />
<br />
However, All this coming to a blizzard store near you. <br />
<br />
Interesting idea but one I'll pass on simply cause it's driven by the no flight if you ask me. (and I don't support the store)</div></div><hr />

Remember Blizzcon a couple of years ago? He showed horde favouritism and the forums exploded with idiotic whining and accusations against him left, right and centre the following year pretty much he wore an alliance hoodie if I remember right to appease whiners.<br />

That said the winning one will end up a Blizzard store purchase no doubt.</div></div><hr />

Really badass idea.<br />
<br />
but i'll bet my lunch money that it wont only be one making it into the game when all is said and done...<br />
<br />
Edit: Perhaps Winning mount is free and runner up is store mount. They cant not pay for this promotion and not take advantage of both end products.</div></div><hr />

This so much. It's ignorant to expect developers to work 24/7 and get no time to do anything else. Blizzard has schedules, as long as they meet a weekly schedule quota and release in the time frame they are aiming for, they can do whatever the hell they want.<br />

Nah just more interesting faction leaders mostly. Most of the horde stuff is ugly as heck, old and torn and beat up looking.

You can thank Blizzard for that, by trotting out that tired excuse every time they do something. Hey, we wanted to do this cool thing, but we did not because it will cost X raid tiers, or we did so next raid will only have X tiers. They are the ones who started conflating together every little thing with raid tiers.</div></div><hr />

Didn't you hear, they are already completely done with WoD but they can't release until the book is out, and then because it's summer they can't release it, then they don't want to steal thunder of the Hero's of the Storm beta, so they are going to wait until Christmas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-10, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: &quot;This is going to waste resources for the expansion!&quot;<br />
A: No it's not. Devs have nothing to do with this and if you say it costs them money you're stupid. You are the same types of people who think Blizzard has a big-cash moneywad they never put to use. Using that logic, the price of two measly bikes is nothing. (And it still would bew/o that logic. Blizzard makes lots of money, they wouldn't buy it if they couldnt afford it).<br />
<br />
Q: &quot;It'll be put in the cash shop!&quot;<br />
A: First off, the ignorance of that assumption makes me cringe. Do you think they'd really put a one faction mount into a cash shop that everyone has access to? Second off, this is an event for the community. It wouldn't be for the community anymore if they put a monopolized it.<br />
<br />
Q: &quot;Horde is gonna win! So unfair and biased!&quot;<br />
A: Maybe, maybe not. We don't know. While i definitely see where you're coming from (and partially feel the same way), Unless there is a census on the global horde population versus alliance of THIS YEAR, you can't say that. The competition isn't biased. (the winning faction's reward will be by default though). Metzen, the posterchild of Thrall is on the ALLIANCE for pete's sake. I doubt there is any favoritism here.<br />
<br />
Q: &quot;This is dumb! give me moar WoW content!&quot;<br />
A: That's your opinion, and stop whining it'll come soon.<br />
<br />
Just because they are having fun with the community and with eachother doesnt mean they are wasting money, resources, etc. Blizzard obviously has enough of what they need for their games, and they CERTAINLY didn't plan this out in advance or anything right?.... But seriously, you folks need to stop the constant bandwagon hatred you whip Blizzard with. I'm so glad you types of people are only a small percentage of the game's community.<br />
<br />
My only problem with this, is that it will cause tons of whining and bitching in the forum from the loosing faction saying shit like <br />
buuuh! Blizz favors the [insert faction here]! Me wants shiny chopper mount! I QUIT WOW IF U NO GIVE TO ME NAO!. Unless they have a plan for the losers that makes them feel better about themselves. Basically a (less cool) mount that's more like a &quot;You Tried!&quot; trophy. I'm also curious how it will be obtained in-game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">markdall</div><div class="date">2014-04-10, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember the several years I used to care about horde or alliance. I do! <br />
<br />
Then a bunch of stuff went down: <br />
<br />
1. They took the alliance's version of Thrall (you know, former faction leader, played a huge role in some key quests, other faction had to kill him for credit for his city) - I'm talking about Bolvar Fordragon of course - and turned him in to the new Lich King. <br />
<br />
2. Blizzard ensured that every other faction leader was unadmirable in some way. Here comes the wall of text: <br />
<br />
Orcs are brutish, unnuanced, slobbering player killers as shown by Garrosh et. al. <br />
<br />
Trolls are cannibals. Now one is the leader of the horde? Could not care less, seriously. And I play a goblin these days. <br />
<br />
Tauren don't even seem to belong in the horde. <br />
<br />
Blood Elves are douche-y though their faction leader's actually probably the least terrible. <br />
<br />
Undead are blatantly planning on killing everybody (roll a Worgen level it 'til you get out of the starter zone if you don't believe me.) <br />
<br />
Goblins are just like Gnomes, except while Goblins are greedy and incapable, Gnomes are just incapable. (this applies to their leaders as well) <br />
<br />
Dwarves got greedy (king's a diamond lol) meanwhile some uh... see you next Tuesday I've killed &gt; 100 times who is blatantly evil and in league with evil dwarves is now running stuff. <br />
<br />
The human king throws lots of fits and seems lame, and has lost my respect because:<br />
<br />
Jaina has betrayed him at least once so far (Battle for undercity, casting frost nova on your liege is treason) without consequence. <br />
<br />
Nobody cares about Velen and his out-of-the-way, can't-even-fly-there poorly laid out 'city' of a crashed wannabe Tardis-cum-shopping mall. <br />
<br />
The worgen leader seems ok. He and the Blood elf guy are the least bad. <br />
<br />
tl;dr: Blizz made the all the faction leaders so bad I no longer care about the factions and just wish I could group, raid, and BG cross faction. Seriously. I will never feel pride for the alliance or horde again.</div></div><hr />

When they give us nice things, we'll be able to have them. Sounds like they will be having fun, so that's cool. I'm not looking forward to another mount I have to either PVP for, complete achievements for, or worst of all, purchase from them. That's not a &quot;nice thing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how they are late on the expansion when they never announced a solid release date. And they still have quite a few months before their potential release date. It's not a TV show, that would actually cost shit. It's just going to be a short web series. Perhaps one episode long since it doesn't take that long to build a souped up vehicles on camera when you consider TV shows like Monster Garage who build atleast 2 awesome supercars an episode. (Which basically means they cut alot of the boring parts out) turns out it will be 8 episodes long. But that still leaves us to ask how frequently they will come out. I bet this is all pre-recorded, so i doubt it'll actively take away time from the blizz people involved. They had to have done it in a schedule that fits everyone anyways.</div></div><hr />

This is also somewhere at the bottom of the &quot;list of WoW-related TV shows Blizzard should pursue&quot;. It's either bottom-of-the-barrel stuff, or something that big Blizzard players wanted personally.<br />
<br />
It's not going to delay WoD or anything, but I'm not really excited at all. It also seems like anything more than a single episode (it IS just a one-episode thing, right?) would be stretching it way too thin.</div></div><hr />

A: No it's not. Devs have nothing to do with this and if you say it costs them money you're stupid. You are the same types of people who think Blizzard has a big-cash moneywad they never put to use. Using that logic, the price of two measly bikes is nothing. (And it still would bew/o that logic. Blizzard makes lots of money, they wouldn't buy it if they couldnt afford it). No matter what, Blizzard has a finite amount of resources, so to some, albeit minor, extent, this is actually taking away from game development. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: &quot;It'll be put in the cash shop!&quot;<br />
A: First off, the ignorance of that assumption makes me cringe. Do you think they'd really put a one faction mount into a cash shop that everyone has access to? Second off, this is an event for the community. It wouldn't be for the community anymore if they put a monopolized it. You think they're going to put a mount in the game and only let the winning faction ride it? That's retarded. There's no reason to say they are definitely going to put it on the Shop, but there's just as little reason to say they couldn't. It's theirs, they'll monetize whatever they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: &quot;Horde is gonna win! So unfair and biased!&quot;<br />
A: Maybe, maybe not. We don't know. While i definitely see where you're coming from (and partially feel the same way), Unless there is a census on the global horde population versus alliance of THIS YEAR, you can't say that. The competition isn't biased. (the winning faction's reward will be by default though). Metzen, the posterchild of Thrall is on the ALLIANCE for pete's sake. I doubt there is any favoritism here. Metzen being on the Alliance team actually makes it MORE Horde biased, not less so. He didn't just up and magically stop being a Horde/Thrall fanboy. He's just trying real hard to lose that rep, and it's not working.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: &quot;This is dumb! give me moar WoW content!&quot;<br />
A: That's your opinion, and stop whining it'll come soon. Stating opinion is a perfectly valid use of the the comments, as well as a perfectly valid response to an announcement. Don't like it? Don't read it.</div></div><hr />

It's alright, Metzen gets more time in front of the camera so it doesn't matter if content needs to be delayed.<br />
<br />
Plus, they'll probably have coupon codes during the middle of each webisode that we can apply when we go to purchase this fantastic faction themed store mount!<br />
<br />
To hell with the expansion! They haven't given a solid release date, and even though they said December of this year if they don't release it for another 10 years it's alright because I support everything they do with absolute undying fealty.<br />

<br />
Pretty much. There is no such thing as an &quot;Alliance community&quot;, and Alliance players don't care to invest in people that treat them like second class citizens as far as providing an interesting story is concerned. Alliance faction pride is a thing of the past and the devs and reps at Blizzard have helped hammer it down at events like Blizzcon with continuous Horde calls. At this point I'm just in it for the gameplay and have stopped giving a shit about the story and characters on my faction, much less events outside of the game such as this.<br />

<br />
Enough with the baseless claims. It's obvious it's a fair amount of players for both sides. Also, the fact that Metzen is trying to go back to giving alliance some love or atleast be neutral means that he actually acknowledges he needs to treat all of his player base good and not just one faction. it's only been one expansion or two since his attempts so there's no sense in saying &quot;it's not working&quot; if we have nothing to go off of. if you didn't notice in his Blizzcon 2013 speech it was all about the Alliance for once. Things are starting to change.<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter what, Blizzard has a finite amount of resources, so to some, albeit minor, extent, this is actually taking away from game development. That doesn't mean they don't use it wisely and didn't plan this event ahead. Keep in mind this is not a TV show but a web show, so that only leaves the price of two bikes which is pocket money for Blizzard that can easily be replaced just as fast as it was lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stating opinion is a perfectly valid use of the the comments, as well as a perfectly valid response to an announcement. Don't like it? Don't read it. Never said you COULDN'T have an opinion, but the piles of nonconstructive whining over everything that Blizzard does is plain ridiculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
You think they're going to put a mount in the game and only let the winning faction ride it? That's retarded. There's no reason to say they are definitely going to put it on the Shop, but there's just as little reason to say they couldn't. It's theirs, they'll monetize whatever they want. Then that makes your point null as well. It'd be just as silly to have a cash shop mount that only one faction could ride. I highly doubt a mount with Alliance stuff all over it would make sense to be accessible for the horde. Let alone in a cash shop as if horde players would spend money for it. The mount would be geared towards one faction which cuts the potential profit in half. It would be a bad marketing choice. The chance they'll monetize it isnt too likely because of this. Blizzard doesn't monetize EVERYTHING as much as you'd like to believe. (As quoted from Crithto (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12473177642#1)):<br />

That's the amount of players playing. That doesn't mean those 52% give a stuff about their faction. If this is a vote between the factions, it's going to be based on faction pride. Of which there is none to be found in the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Our story is retarded. Our &quot;heroes&quot; are retarded. There is little representation of Alliance on the &quot;team&quot;. When people watch Blizzcon, you watch Chris continuously talk about &quot;such and such will be awesome for the Horde&quot;, &quot;Thrall is going to&quot;, &quot;Lok'tar&quot; screams every few minutes with a huge roar from the crowd. There is no Alliance community that will care about something like this, and most of us will just be rolling our eyes at Metzen &quot;representing&quot; the Alliance - a faction he has thrown the bare minimum to in terms of story in recent years while his poster-child Thrall takes front stage.<br />

They have a game to advertise, a web series has potential to hook in new players, pets/mounts advertising tends to be focused on existing customers.<br />
<br />
You don't just put out one advert and go *welp thats the advertising done for the next 10 years* they are a business, of course they are going to advertise their product, you are completely daft in the head if you think otherwise.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to it, its a bit of fun, gets the community involved, and could potentially bring new players to the game. win win.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-10, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the amount of players playing. That doesn't mean those 52% give a stuff about their faction. If this is a vote between the factions, it's going to be based on faction pride. Of which there is none to be found in the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Our story is retarded. Our &quot;heroes&quot; are retarded. There is little representation of Alliance on the &quot;team&quot;. When people watch Blizzcon, you watch Chris continuously talk about &quot;such and such will be awesome for the Horde&quot;, &quot;Thrall is going to&quot;, &quot;Lok'tar&quot; screams every few minutes with a huge roar from the crowd. There is no Alliance community that will care about something like this, and most of us will just be rolling our eyes at Metzen &quot;representing&quot; the Alliance - a faction he has thrown the bare minimum to in terms of story in recent years while his poster-child Thrall takes front stage.<br />
<br />
That picture was addressing you saying Alliance population is non-existent. It's there, they just aren't as loud like you said. If Alliance doesn't care, then it wouldn't be a problem if they won or lost. Although I do agree that there should be some sort of judge on this instead of votes alone. Also, Alliance has gotten love in blizzcon before and our story isn't that bad. Blizzard just hasn't gotten time to focus on us as much, sadly. They did say they wanted to advance alliance plot alot more with the Draenei though.</div></div><hr />

I could see this working for the cross-section of people who are into the bike scene AND happen to play World of Warcraft, which has got to be a pretty small demographic.

Unsatisfied Customer<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed that for you. A lot of people overlook that part and just think of Blizzard as the cool college kid that buys them beer from time to time instead of realizing they're a business. <br />
<br />
Well, they remember it's a business when it's convenient for whatever clichÃ© argument they're trying to present.<br />
<br />
But when it comes time to argue with somebody else about the fact that it's a business they seem to forget the fact that they have rights as customers. (Or their parents do which is more likely as they have no apparent idea what their money actually DOES entitle them to have a negative opinion about a product that they are paying for, and to express it through whatever means they feel necessary in a preferably professional manner with constructive feedback.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an Alliance player myself, I definitely see your point. In faction spirit, i Alliance players care more about the game. But with that being said, it doesnt mean they don't want a mount for their faction if not for themselves. When people see the advertisement to vote, I doubt the majority of Alliance wont want to vote. People will say &quot;oh horde will win&quot; but it doesnt stop others from wanting to vote their underdog faction anyways. <br />
<br />
also, as far as Alliance getting no love at Blizzcon, i said the same to another person - Blizzard, more specifically, metzen has realized the bias and is trying to atleast go back to a neutral light (which i agree is kind of hard when Thrall is your icon). You speak of all these speeches favoring horde? Well notice that in blizzcon 2013 before announcing WoD, he gave a huge nod to the Alliance, and even acknowledged how they didn't get much love for Cata and MoP. The point is that things are changing. Slowly, but surely.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Good points, but I think the reward of a cool mount is a good enough motive for alliance players to vote their faction regardless of the team spirit. And also, alliance have been starting to get more love.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder where they could get a little extra money from?<br />
<br />
I don't care to see this crap. I care to see content added to the game quicker and in higher quality, because I pay 15 dollars a month + for the game. I don't pay for a web series I have no desire to watch. <br />
<br />
Money is money, and where do you think the revenue for this advertising and merchandising is coming from, exactly? Out of their own pockets?</div></div><hr />

He wants to make it up, kind of...<br />
<br />
I would hope so, but its a little too late now isn't it?<br />
<br />
I honestly doubt WoW is going to last another 3 expansions, and ignoring Alliance development until this point has pretty much added insult to injury if he tries to pull a 180 on his attention to both factions. It pretty much would acknowledge that he knows he ignored Alliance development.<br />
<br />
And before anyone says &quot;you guys will never be happy with anything blizzard does&quot; I'd be welcoming for the change of pace and attention, but I'm not going to thank him for it. There were countless times that if there was some lore development on the Alliance scene, the lore of the game could have been enhanced even more than it currently is, but most attention was given to Horde lore development, and that has just pushed us into the direction we are now, Pandaria ended in an orcish rampage and technical genocide, and now we have an entire expansion to do it again that focuses on more orc lore.<br />
<br />
My only request from Blizzard is to make sure the Draenei story is as engaging as the Horde questline, since we are talking about the only two races who are the main focus of this expansion being divided among faction lines, and I really hope that gets played out alot more than BC did.</div></div><hr />

1. Gnomish technology is largely nuclear (even the current mechgineer's chopper has green nuclear fuel or waste in the 'gas' tank below the seat, so that's probably steam exhaust).<br />

<br />
So I really don't want to get dragged into some alliance story vs horde story debate BUT there's one thing that has always puzzled me. I constantly see Alliance saying that they get no story, I own most of the Warcraft books and I've read all but like 3, and if there's one thing I noticed about them it is that the alliance characters get a lot more mention in those books than the horde characters do. There are some exceptions, but by and large the books are alliance focused it seems. So is it because the alliance does not feel they should have to read books to get the complete story? <br />
<br />
I mean, I don't see any horde players complaining (although I'm sure there are some somewhere, if there exists something to complain about, at least one WoW player has complained about it) that they paid $12 for a book and the story is overwhelmingly alliance-centric. And it's not because I go back to play WoW and think &quot;Oh well, at least this part is all about me&quot; it's because it's a STORY. To tell a GOOD story, the storyteller should NOT concern themselves with being 'fair'. <br />
<br />
So is the neglect because the alliance takes so many losses, or because their story inside the game is not as compelling as the Hordes? I've never done the alliance quests, I just kind of assumed they got about as many as the horde did and 95% of them were pointless and a few actually advanced the story of Warcraft, mostly I get the story from the books so I always felt it was more Alliance centered as part of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alliance has some nice things that might look good like the lion figure , eagle , hammers, gears ( thinking steampunk with those even if i'm not really a fan of that) , draenei-narru etc<br />
<br />
For Horde i guess it's unsure if they keep with the &quot;iron horde&quot; look which was garrosh and most say that wasn't true horde whatever , or go like how that shield symbol is and end up being something raw like totems, voodoo masks , trinkets , spears etc . The only cool thing i can think of would be a glowing green gas tank or something to resemble the undead race plague but that's just off the top of my head. <br />
<br />
All in all i have hopes for the alliance one, should be fun to watch either way tho' .</div></div><hr />

Blizzard won't tell you this, but Greg Street's a front for Metzen's true identity.</div></div><hr />

WoW+American Chopper! Its like the who's who of 6 years ago!! <br />
<br />
I feel kinda sorry for those guys at Blizzard. They used to be the bomb but its so sad and pathetic to see them in that silly mid 90's blizzard shirts still living like its the hey day. Like watching an old hollywood star making an appearance on a CW tv show. Or some one hit wonder on dancing with the stars. Its ok do grow old and fade away.</div></div><hr />

&quot;lol Metzen Alliance&quot;<br />
He's an Alliance holy priest, contrary to the popular belief that he's a Horde mage.<br />
<br />
1) That's was Ghostcrawler<br />
2) Metzen is the coked up asshat who lives vicariously through this Mary Sue creation Orc Jesus.</div></div><hr />

Well it's good to see our microtransaction money being put to good use developing content and more Blizzard games instead of leveraging it into crappy TV and building motorcycles to live out their nerd fantasies on the players' dime. Oh wait...that is what they are doing? Well...that's uhh...ok. Tacky Blizzard. *shakes head*<br />

How is reality tv a cancer, how has Blizzard been cancerous since wotlk? Don't just claim stuff, back it up with something. You're just using foul language to express whatever frustration you seem to have.<br />

Oh and I totally expect this to be a store mount so I won't vote or watch (microtransactions don't belong into WoW).<br />

Until they confirm a craft / quest / drop mount I don't want anything to do with this.<br />
