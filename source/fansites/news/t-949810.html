Still, if the Pandaren are to be introduced as a race, I know that i'd be rather overjoyed where they a neutral race who perhaps in a questline would pledge themselves to the Alliance or the Horde.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping and hoping if this is indeed the next expansion, it turns out to be awesome, and a not jumping the shark moment. :/ I love pandaren as much as the next person, and WCIII was awesome, but I was pretty happy they kept pandaren on the down low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would make more sense for a Warcraft game. WoW expansions havent been named after a races homeland yet, and if they were going for another new race, you would assume there would be two of them again and naming the game after only one of the races doesnt make sense.<br />
<br />
Unless they revolve a whole expansion around Panderans as a neutral race and players go to their homeland to fight evil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason Pandaren were taken out of vanilla wow was china. They were intended for the game from the start, either as NPCs or playable toons. Go back and play the end of WC3, there's a pandaren beermaster or w/e, and a bunch of lore tied to him and the other pandas that settled in kalimdor.</div></div><hr />

Well no you made an assumption that none of us are aware of. thats not trolling. from our perspective you can't read, even though thats not the case...mb you should just let it go and not get so defnesive about your incorrect assumption. just a thought...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sting</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know, it seems awefully stupid to give one faction the Pandaren as they're wildly popular. NPC only race? Being able to &quot;choose your faction&quot; when you start it? The latter would be a new concept, and I doubt Blizzard is just gonna do like they did so far which was &quot;add races--&gt;add class--&gt;add races&quot;. Having the Pandaren playable would be a big selling point. I still give it a 50/50 that it's a decoy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noteworthynerd</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're gonna use my idea! <br />
<br />
<br />
Levels 85-90: Great Sea / South Sea Islands expansion<br />
- Location:<br />
* Small Islands scattered throughout the Great Sea (including Pandaria!)<br />
* The Emerald Dream<br />
<br />
- New Race: Pandaren<br />
* Neutral affiliation until the end of the starting zone quests (~level 12) when the player selects whether to join the Horde or the Alliance. This decision is final, and the only way to change factions would be to pay the $30 faction change fee.<br />
<br />
- New Class: Pirate (DPS/Healer Hybrid)<br />
* Talent Trees: Swashbuckler: Melee DPS (dual-wield); Mercenary: Ranged DPS (ranged weapons, no pet); Apothecary: Healing (focuses on use of &quot;medicines&quot; instead of traditional healing spells)<br />
* Armor Proficiency: Leather<br />
* Weapon Skills: One-Handed Swords, One-Handed Axes, One-Handed Maces, Daggers, Fist Weapons, Bows, Guns (and likely Staves or Polearms)<br />
* Resource System: Charisma (works similar to Runic Power, builds up as you fight, and then can be spent on powerful moves) for DPS specs, &quot;Ingredients&quot; (works similar to mana, as you use your &quot;medicines&quot;, your ingredients slowly deplete, ingredients can be replenished by mana potions and food (e.g. mage food)) for Apothecary.<br />
* Primary Stats: Swashbuckler and Mercenary: Agility; Apothecary: Intellect and Spirit (which will increase Ingredient regeneration)<br />
<br />
- Possible enemies: Zul and the Trolls that ally with him; Azshara; N'Zoth (the Old God responsible for corrupting Deathwing, sparking the Emerald Nightmare and creating the Naga)</div></div><hr />

Go back and play the end of WC3, there's a pandaren beermaster or w/e, and a bunch of lore tied to him and the other pandas that settled in kalimdor.<br />
<br />
Only not so much. The inclusion of Chen Stormstout the Pandaren Brewmaster was a little easter egg in the bonus campaign of TFT. They weren't ever intended to feature prominently in the story. They weren't even invented by metzen - Pandaren began life as a cute drawing by Samwise Didier, inspired by either his son being cute, or by someone saying he looked like a panda (don't quite recall).<br />
<br />
This panda nonsense with china is complete boloney. People want to believe that that is the sort of thing that china would do, so they believe it. It's a bummer that it bears no relation to reality though.</div></div><hr />

No, and no one will, unless you explain why Blizzard would fold a subscription based service with 12 million people who pay 15 dollars every freaking month, plus 30 bucks for each expansion, in exchange for a one-off sale of a WcVI:MoP that 5 million people would pay 50 dollar once for.

Pandaria is the name of the continent, just like Northrend. It doesn't mean the whole continent if filled with only pandas, just like Northrend wasn't filled with Tuskarr and then nothing else.</div></div><hr />

A (http://www.china.org.cn/english/environment/232989.htm) law banning images of pandas being abused, aka a panda getting killed by a digital orc. People believe it's something China would do, because it IS something China would do.<br />

<br />
Meh, endangered in this game is a funny word. To my mind, Arthas probably didn't have as many Death Knights as we see in the game. And Bilgewater goblins, more of them seem to keep &quot;washing ashore&quot;. The island they came from was tiny! Worgen...honestly, did that many people get converted? I imagine most of them would've just been ripped to shreds. Plus, after 6 years, the Forsaken still haven't completely tapped out the human corpses around Lordaeron for some reason.<br />
<br />
Besides, maybe Pandaren are like jackrabbits. :)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if this was a marketing decision. &quot;Man, we made this new expansion that is awesome, and still people do the content and unsub until the next content patch. Maybe we should give the players something most of them have been hollering about for years. That's it! Unleash the pandas!&quot;<br />

They could easily be druids which would help the fact of &quot;The emerald dream&quot;. With malfurion not holding it back any longer and pushing Deathwing back, god only knows what is happening with in the dream. It would make sense if you follow that fact. The pandas come out of hiding to warn the world of the emeral dream and therefore are forced to join sides or teach all races the new hero classesPandarians can possibly berunemastersBrewmastersalchemist (based off their habit to brew drinks)Demon hunters (based off IF they have anything to do with druids)Monks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domiku</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do see the funny side and it actualy sounds kinda epic if you read the wikki page here: http://www.wowwiki.com/Pandaria <br />
Pandaria is a legendary place of bambus forests and the mysterious pandaren of the Pandaren Empire. Pandaren hail from the distant island nation of Pandaria, which non-pandarens have never seen or ever visited to this day.[1][2][3] The Pandaren Empire was founded before the Great Sundering of the world, and is believed to be just as old as the kaldorei civilization. It shared and traded resources, goods, ideas and mystic knowledge with the haughty night elves of central Kalimdor in the years before the War of the Ancients. As the night elves' obsession with the forces of magic drove them to the brink of madness, the gentle pandaren severed ties, withdrew and closed their borders,[4] and left the night elves behind forever. The pandaren clans, or shao'dins, traveled far across the seas and established crude but beautiful cities of stone and sturdy bambus reed on an island they named Pandaria.[5] In time they built a new empire on the island. For ten millennia, the world had forgotten pandaren. Shortly after the Third War, though, a few reappeared — perhaps roused from their isolation by the Burning Legion, whose catastrophic coming shook the world.[6] Pandarens have chosen to keep the location of their island a secret and most are content to remain there, with only the rare few pandaren choosing to leave and see the outside world. <br />
Pandaria is apparently known for its gems (which are apparently magical). The red dragons believed that three crushed gems from Pandaria are one of the components needed to rejuvenate the Sunwell. <br />
Pandaren society has changed from its origins. Where once the pandaren were a mighty empire, standing proud beside their night elf allies, now they are a simple people who want only peace and a safe home. Yet the world is a dangerous place, and only through an acceptance of the violence that comes with life can the pandaren continue to prosper. Pandaren society is, in many ways, compartmentalized. At their core, the pandaren treasure peace and creativity. Most pandaren are poets and singers, and the craftsmen of their culture are truly revered. The danger of their lives, however, has necessitated the evolution of a class of warriors to defend those ideals — it is these warriors, from the simplest pikeman to the great shodopans, who ensure that Pandaren culture survives. Even the lowliest pandaren is capable of defending himself, using the fangs and stubby but needle-like claws that are a natural part of his body. All pandaren can use these natural weapons to fight and hunt, as pandaren grow up playing rough and tumble games meant to hone their abilities while learning the admonishments of their elders that such things are a last resort. In general, pandaren prefer to use the weapons they craft, feeling that their natural weapons hearken back to a primal time. Pandaren are bipedal creatures, but their ursine forms allow them to move at tremendous speed on four limbs. When a pandaren drops down to all fours, his speed increases greatly. He must have nothing in his hands to use quadrupedal movement. So Sunwell redone, New race, Possibly a new healing class (monks) and loads of new tasty law... sounds pro to me.

Especially since development costs for the WcIV would probably be higher than for an expansion.<br />
<br />
So somehow, in your mind, they cannot make both the next wow expansion and WC4 at the same time? Since when does making one game have to be at the exclusion of developing another?<br />

WC4 won't happen. It is totally useless, as it can't give anything novels and the game can't give. Also, they have another RTS going, and fighting yourself on the market makes no sense for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

N'zoth isnt mentioned by name but every zone, particularly hyjal has twilight cultists yelling something like &quot;we may serve deathwing, but we also serve a being of greater power&quot;.<br />
I tink next patch is deathwing, and then its revealed he was parasitised by N''zoth as a get of of jail loophole- because i doubt the titans expected the aspect of the earth to go this way.</div></div><hr />

I am trying to find my post where I had made my speculation distriubtion on expansions after this revelation.

I am not sure what you are talking about in your first sentence. Not trying to be a grammar natzi or anything, but to me, it doesn't make any sense. <br />
<br />
But I don't think it would be useless at all. There are PLENTY of wc3 fans out there that like that RTS better, or like the theme of the RTS better, or whatever, that would gladly buy it. Money-making definitely. Plus I think there are people who wish to experience a warcraft story in a non-mmo format.<br />
<br />
How would this be fighting themselves on the market? SC2 Is not a subscription-based game so the only opportunity cost there would be people who have not YET bought SC2 that WILL buy SC2, but would instead buy WC4.</div></div><hr />

I can think of several directions this could be going in, both for the good and the bad, but there really isn't enough information to draw any kind of reasonable conclusion from yet. If this is an expansion, it'd be a very good idea to withhold judgment until more concrete details emerge, because out of context, it just seems incredibly bizarre. I'm sure there's an explanation (though I won't deign to predict its quality).<br />

<br />
My vote is on &quot;both or neither.&quot; I mean, there's already 3 iterations of humans in the game, one of which a different faction from the others.... why not? Pandarians were always depicted having a pole banner at their backs, just have them show Alliance or Horde symbols and toggleable like Worgen form.<br />
<br />
That or make them yet another awesome, superior-looking NPC race we never get to play.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekosom</div><div class="date">2011-08-03, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People like to complain, but Pandaria was always an intriguing idea. WoW's lore has always been an amalgamation of all sorts of different myths, from different European myths to Native American and, more recently, Egyptian. The one thing they've never touched is Eastern lore. And I'm not just talking about China or Japan..India also has a rich mythological tradition that could work very well in WoW. As much as people like to say the Panderans were a &quot;joke&quot; race, the idea of land in Azeroth where Blizzard could go an entirely different direction storywise is too appealing for them to pass up. It was only a matter of time, and I say now is as good a time as any. I'd imagine Pandaria will wind up being located opposite Northrend on the edge of southern Azeroth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovelust</div><div class="date">2011-08-03, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why Pandaren are necessarily &quot;joke characters with no background&quot;. Blizzard doesn't have to tell us everything about the game, and It's safe to assume we don't know everything about the game. The lore we do know is the lore they chose to share with us, which is always able to be added to.<br />
On a related note, most authors/creators really don't tell you that much about the worlds they create. The worlds in their minds are always much larger than they're able to express properly. Always.</div></div><hr />

New hero class will be some sort of Monk, playable by all races, starting area will be some Pandaran Monastery maybe in Stonetalon starting around level 70? <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A splinter group of pandaren arrived on Kalimdor in the aftermath of the Third War (http://www.wowwiki.com/Third_War) and has established a settlement (http://www.wowwiki.com/Pandaren_Settlement) in the Stonetalon Mountains (http://www.wowwiki.com/Stonetalon_Mountains) ofKalimdor (http://www.wowwiki.com/Kalimdor),[1] (http://www.wowwiki.com/Pandaria#cite_note-A.26HC21-0) but the location remains as secret as that of their island homeland.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe someone could scope out some of the empty spaces around stonetalon and see if there is a good place to put a small village or phased starting area.</div></div><hr />

July 2007:http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/601638-Wrath-of-the-Lich-King-Final-confirmationBlizzard Trademarks &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;People were barely seeing Illidan kills and such. I don't think Kil'jaeden and the Sunwell was even announced yet (correct if i'm wrong), Then it was Officially announced at Blizzcon<br />
<br />
August 2009:http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/655147-Blizzard-trademarks-quot-Cataclysm-quotBlizzard Trademarks: &quot;Cataclysm&quot; Onyxia was being released soon, ICC was not out, but would be announced soon.<br />
<br />
July 2011:<br />
Current Post: Blizzard Trademarks: Mist of PandariaHeroic Rag has been downed by 7 guilds world wide. Deathwing is still killing people in different zones. Only seems to fit their schedule quite well. How it will affect the future of the game, well we have to wait till October. Something Fresh?<br />
<br />
Let the speculations begin!<br />
<br />
This. I'm definitely calling this the next expansion, as silly as it may be it excites me. Pandaren won't be playable but I'm sure it will be some kind of new Shatt/Dal city hub. New Hero class, I doubt it being a Monk but compare that to Brewmaster and it just seems so much more realistic. Either way I'm looking forward to it, I'm sure it will somehow invole Queen Azshara.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrowstormen</div><div class="date">2011-08-03, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what if its the next Warcraft game? Warcraft IV: MoP?<br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
Chances are so small that it's not to believe. <br />
<br />
The expansion to WoW is WAY closer than ANY idea of WC4. <br />
<br />
In fact, I'm willing to bet it won't happen within 10 years, if ever. Not when SC2 just came out, they Titan on work, expansion on work, D3 on work, and SC2 expansions on work.</div></div><hr />

Look up Pandaria on wowpedia... seems I can't post links until I've posted a few times. Mentions that Pandaria is part of the Warcraft RPG. It may be a future future expansion, maybe 2 expansions away or something of the sort?</div></div><hr />

Seriously? A cross promotion with Panda express? What are you smoking? Samwise Didier created the Pandaren from his personal habit of putting pandas in everything.</div></div><hr />
