It's not. This post is from today, March 17th 2016. The battle.net client in reference didn't exist in 2007. Way way back in the day they added ingame voice chat to WoW specifically and it bombed. This seems more like a universal client that can be accessed through the battle.net app between all blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they tried this before, but not 5 years ago. Has been a little while longer since they tried the whole WoW Voice Chat thing and it turned out horrible, hence why it isn't in the Game anymore. Let's hope this thing will be better, if they actually think about putting those ingame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubt that they'll have it active in LFG/LFR acessed content. It'll only end up creating more toxic behavior than there already is (or help enhance the toxic behavior that is already given, really..) and they should know that.<br />
<br />
That said, it'd still be a nice addition, if it's about 5 times better than their first attempt at Voice Communication.</div></div><hr />

Just because those players that does not raid and have big guilds can be socially active in other ways and maybe make friends and love the game more. Just my take on it!

But I get their reasoning for it though, it's not like people aren't running the program, adding additional functionality to it is a good idea. But unless it's better than alternative programs I cant see people actually using it, no matter how many people it fits in one channel.</div></div><hr />

A voice program for only blizzard games will not work. <br />

Patch 2.2.0<br />
<br />
Voice Chat - The new Voice Chat feature is now available in game. Players will need to go into the options menu under Sound &amp; Voice to activate it. Volume sliders are available for the microphone, speakers, and game-audio fade (which automatically lowers the game audio when a voice communication is received), as is a “push-to-talk” setting. Right-clicking on a player’s name now includes the option to mute or unmute that player. Muting another player blocks all voice chat from him or her; the ignore feature now blocks both voice chat and text chat from that player.</div></div><hr />

I think the problem is just as you said, there isn't a dedicated voice tool for everyone to use that doesn't suck. For guilds it's no big deal but for pugs it's pulling teeth to get everyone to get into voice chat because they don't want to download their 5th voice chat program, now they have less of an excuse as long as it works properly.</div></div><hr />

I know its gonna slightly upgrade the pug experience, but its gonna give a lot of work to the raid leader. For this to work, they need to give the raid leader a bundle of tools to control his chat room. Both when it comes to mute and kicking. If they do that, which they might not do since they blizzard, then its gonna be a usefull tool for pugs..... But thats it. Dungeon groups are not organized enough for them to use the system and guilds want to have more control over their voice-chat then something blizzard can mix up. Also, its another thing which can go broke, so its at the same lvl as other voice chats.</div></div><hr />

They're doing it so there's a unified voice chat for all of their games. You listed four different programs, meaning the playerbase is split among those and other VoIP programs. So long as they can maintain and iterate it, which is the real question, it could go a long way towards improving and unifying the Battle.net community.</div></div><hr />

I think that would be ideal as it instantly would give people have mics/speakers a means to communicate rather then to have to turn the feature on. Without testing it maybe this is how it will work more. &quot;shrugs&quot;. Idea's... But seriously I'm sick of having to use alternate solutions like ts or vent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
.... Like, who is even asking for this? We already have Teamspeak, Ventrilo, Large skype calls and now Discord. While updating the ingame voice chat is always a good thing, im not gonna complain about getting a new ingame tool, but i really dont think it is needed. So many guilds have already a TS/Vent servers set up and they are working very good.<br />

Without any ingame moderation of the voice chat, i dont see it being used by many teams.<br />

They're doing it so there's a unified voice chat for all of their games. You listed four different programs, meaning the playerbase is split among those and other VoIP programs. So long as they can maintain and iterate it, which is the real question, it could go a long way towards improving and unifying the Battle.net community.<br />
<br />
Exactly. And honestly in 2016 it's pretty embarrassing that they don't have voice chat in games like HoTS and WoW.</div></div><hr />

By your line of thinking then why Blizzard bothers adding a LFG/LFD feature in WoW as an option when you have things like OpenRaid websites?<br />
<br />
The voice chat just like LFG/LFD feature in WoW is a convenience for players especially for pugs which are really in need of something as useful such as this.<br />
<br />
If you give them the tools they are going to use it, even if the tools aren't the greatest such as others alternatives, the option still there, so in other words, people are going to use it.</div></div><hr />

This has always been my main gripe with raiding. I never managed to find a guild or raid group that didn't have multiple people who insisted on voice activation.

Twitter works fine. The issue was that the patch contained almost no content.<br />
<br />
Excited to see their new voice develop through alpha. They have a wealth of VoIP programs that wow players have used for years as reference, and from what I understand they're developing it with an experienced VoIP company. That it's cross-game is a definite plus. Initially, it was just going to be with Overwatch and a distant future thing for wow. This is a much-needed part of their gaming services with how diversified their games are becoming.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'll hold my reservations for after it's implemented on live.</div></div><hr />

Because I have software that strictly monitors every outgoing connection attempt, I can see the bnet launcher constantly doing this, even while the game is running. We all have very asymmetric connections, so while most have a pretty much robust down stream, often the up stream is pathetically slow. So I do NOT want this to be eating up my upstream while I'm trying to play the game. Low &amp; behold, there is an option to NOT do this, so I set it that way.<br />
<br />
EXCEPT that setting is bogus, the launcher continues to send data to a host of IP addresses. So I went to the forums to see what was up. An MVP acknowledged that this is a KNOWN issue. Fortunately, there IS an option to quit the launcher when the game gets launched so I set it that way. THAT has stopped upstream data transfer that is NOT part of actually playing the game live.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to a few days ago. One of our heals was having a considerable issue staying connected... we were working Heroic HFC progression, and he was absent for most of the fights (on and off). Thanks GOODNESS our GM is a mythic geared healer, so she was doing an awful lot of solo healing on progression bosses (upper HFC btw). Anyway, the next day he was working on the issue and somehow seemed to feel it was the launcher... he didn't know there was an option to quit it when the game is launched. BINGO, so far it looks like that issue is put to bed... he's not disconnecting every few mins in raids now that the launcher is NOT running while we raid.<br />

Maybe this chat thing is their way of making sure said evil-launcher is always running? MUCH LATER to that, vent works just fine!</div></div><hr />

My thoughts as well. God, I hope not. I remember the original voice chat took me about 10 seconds of having a loud child yelling before I learned how to mute it and never turn it on again. The only way this will be useful is if it's a bug-free high-quality system that's a free way to talk to your raid members, because then you won't have to pay for Vent / TS / Mumble servers.</div></div><hr />

While I've talked and chilled with dozen of people in Overwatch voice chat I haven't made any new bnet friends from it so it might just be a casual hi /bye thing in WoW too. I think it will be turned off for LFR but might be on for dungeons and pvp matches for sure. Then raid groups and guilds can manually start the voice group to invite their members. <br />

It's not a feature specific to the game, but rather to the whole battle.net system, which dearly needed improvements like the grouping at the very least :)<br />

The fact that WoW did have a system like that will probably make integration easier.<br />

I think WoW has such a devoted long standing playerbase that it's become kind of weird.

I get sick of having to juggle different programs to deal with pugs. It's a minor annoyance, but anytime I change mics, I have to figure out what settings to change to fit the one I'm using on each program(no matter what, I for some reason get the extremes of either too loud, too quite, or far to sensitive, on top of constant updates to some of them and juggling passwords and other things. <br />
<br />
If they succeed, It'll be a minor 'quality of life' improvement, if not 'oh well'.<br />

They should have a public voice chat like H1Z1 where you can talk to the people near you. Just imagine the discussions in capital cities.<br />

<br />
What makes you believe this is the same? What made the orginal wow voice chat fail was due to it being ingame and that it was really tedious to create channels etc. This should be more or less like teamspeak or similar voice chat as it's integrated in the battle.net client. <br />
<br />
I for one would love this addition. All the guilds i've been in have had problems with voice chats one way or another. When Ts, ventrilo, gamevox etc works it's great, but who hasn't had problems with those? And who really likes typing in new ips every time you're going to play with another group of players?<br />

<br />
It's 2007 again!<br />
<br />
Patch 2.2.0<br />
<br />
Voice Chat - The new Voice Chat feature is now available in game. Players will need to go into the options menu under Sound &amp; Voice to activate it. Volume sliders are available for the microphone, speakers, and game-audio fade (which automatically lowers the game audio when a voice communication is received), as is a “push-to-talk” setting. Right-clicking on a player’s name now includes the option to mute or unmute that player. Muting another player blocks all voice chat from him or her; the ignore feature now blocks both voice chat and text chat from that player.<br />
<br />
Except this is totally different.</div></div><hr />

All the idiosyncrasies of the game have built up over the years to the point that we no longer think about or question them. Having to use a third party utility for voice chat in a game that clearly needs it is pretty silly.<br />
<br />
Im not in anyway saying, that having the system is a bad thing. I just think that outgame voice chats are always going to be better then whatever Blizzard can put together, especially since they are jungling a few other systems at the same time. In my current TS server, i can mute specific people, i can control sound completly. I have different rooms to move officers and specific members to. I even have priority speak. If blizzard can implement all these things, plus more, i will be very surprised, but i will also use their service. But if they dont provide these things, i dont think it can beat Ventrilo and Teamspeak.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, when i think about how many problems blizz have had with stuff like the garrison-phasing, LFD bugs and problems with showing different kinds of groups in LFG, then i know that there is proberly going to be problems with the voice chat.

There are certainly some advantages to TS/Mumble/Vent(maybe not that one *cough*)/Discord/etc, but having used Blizzard's voice chat in Overwatch I can say that for me it's pretty rock solid. They may or may not eventually add features like individual muting etc? Certainly once it becomes BNet level there's a lot more they can do with it vs. its current state. But I think people overestimate how much better dedicated VC is over ingame (if done right - not like the &quot;current&quot; WoW VC lol).<br />
<br />
The other big advantage is you don't have to expect everyone to install a VC app to join your raid chat. I have six different ones on my PC and I barely ever even raid...<br />

<br />
But seriously, the actual voice chat itself works at least as well as any of the applications I have. Simple to use, volume is good, no real audio quality problems that I notice anyway (not an audiophile). The basic functionality is all there already. They might have more problems with how they implement channels etc when it transitions to BNet, that's the only major problem I can see.<br />
<br />
And I guess with WoW's massive playerbase no doubt some setups will have issues with it.</div></div><hr />

Because it's for battle.net and not just WoW? So, if you are in a random Heroes of the Storm games, you could just say: &quot;Hey, if you are interested, join my Bnet channel&quot;. And at the click of a button, you can not communicate through voice chat instead of text. Also, as long as it is good, it would be much more convenient in WoW for pugs. There are just too many different programs that people use (vent, mumble, teamspeak, raidcall, skype). Having a universal voice chat that can be used quickly and easily would be a huge help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is well known that Blizz uses Torrent to deliver files to their customers, I have no issue with that. Because I have software that strictly monitors every outgoing connection attempt, I can see the bnet launcher constantly doing this, even while the game is running. We all have very asymmetric connections, so while most have a pretty much robust down stream, often the up stream is pathetically slow. So I do NOT want this to be eating up my upstream while I'm trying to play the game. Low &amp; behold, there is an option to NOT do this, so I set it that way.<br />
<br />
EXCEPT that setting is bogus, the launcher continues to send data to a host of IP addresses. So I went to the forums to see what was up. An MVP acknowledged that this is a KNOWN issue. Fortunately, there IS an option to quit the launcher when the game gets launched so I set it that way. THAT has stopped upstream data transfer that is NOT part of actually playing the game live.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to a few days ago. One of our heals was having a considerable issue staying connected... we were working Heroic HFC progression, and he was absent for most of the fights (on and off). Thanks GOODNESS our GM is a mythic geared healer, so she was doing an awful lot of solo healing on progression bosses (upper HFC btw). Anyway, the next day he was working on the issue and somehow seemed to feel it was the launcher... he didn't know there was an option to quit it when the game is launched. BINGO, so far it looks like that issue is put to bed... he's not disconnecting every few mins in raids now that the launcher is NOT running while we raid.<br />
<br />
Maybe this chat thing is their way of making sure said evil-launcher is always running? MUCH LATER to that, vent works just fine!<br />
<br />
Blizzard hasn't been using torrent for over a year now. Come on, get with the times.</div></div><hr />

Looking at the first post it would seem you use it from the client which in turns means you can use it for anything including non-blizz games as long as you're running the battle.net client.<br />
<br />
Can't say for sure though considering Overwatch has it built into the game and all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">risingforce</div><div class="date">2016-03-18, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC they're working with a third party voip company for this kind of thing now, though. They put the voice chat in Overwatch, and that actually works surprisingly well.<br />
<br />
Yep! Blizzard did announce with Overwatch they'd be incorporating their own VOIP -and I'm glad you agree it works well.<br />
<br />
I think it's a boon for all gamers to have Blizzard instigate VOIP for their Battle net games, if done right of course. The good news is, at least for WoW, is that we've seen Premades become successful... so hopefully VOIP will help (1) continue drawing in people for PUGs and (2) help build community / opportunities to make friends.<br />
<br />
Personally, I always enjoy TS nights, and I think hosting PUGs will be a lot better (gameplay. mechanics) and friendlier =&gt; it doesn't matter if my PUGs turn on their mics or not, [mic] opt in is just fine for most RLs / PUG leaders.<br />
<br />
Anyway, gg.</div></div><hr />

You didn't read the full post did you this is Battlenet Client VOIP and as such can be used playing any Blizzard game and as others have said you could still use it while playing other games..

And if done right then the need to have six different voice chat programs, the having to enter server details every time you join a pug raids voice chat which is a right pain in the ass, will be gone..<br />

Well players do want it - as long as it offers the basics, then less competent players wont need to download, ventrilo,mumble, TS3, and curse, and discord, and whatever else groups demand of them.<br />
If they can make it compete with those, all the better but i wouldnt expect it to<br />

It has nothing to do with performance or HD space. OMG if you don't have a 1TB HD in this day and age or more then you should probably pick one up for a whole $40. I'm saying it is a lot nicer to add someones battle.tag and click &quot;Voice chat&quot; than go into mumble, enter server information, and join their channel.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people who does have an SSD does not have 1 TB, they often have no HHD at all. 256 GB or 512 GB are normal and there you don't have space for everything.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do really with how much space they take up it has more to do with ease of use.. When you have say six different VOIP programs it becomes a pain every time you join a pug.. Instead of getting straight into the thick of things you are spending time putting in the server information and password for whatever VOIP program the Pug lead is using.. <br />
<br />
Since not everyone is using the same program and not every one is on the same server it becomes a chore and to be frank a lot of pugs don't even use a VOIP program for many reasons from cost to having to wait for raid members getting said program and then putting in the server and password info..<br />
<br />
If this new Blizzard VOIP program works and it should since from reading on here a few months back Blizzard are having a third party supply the VOIP software but not really sure.. But all of this new voice chat is old news as it has been known since October 2015..<br />

https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/3r7uwf/blizzard_did_an_amazing_work_with_the_voice_chat/ And from the first poster here was saying that the Voice Chat that Blizzard are in the process of implementing is insanely high quality with it being said that it is better than &quot;average Skype quality&quot; so if this is what is coming into the Battlenet Client then all the better for us..</div></div><hr />

Has been a little while longer since they tried the whole WoW Voice Chat thing and it turned out horrible, hence why it isn't in the Game anymore. Let's hope this thing will be better, if they actually think about putting those ingame.<br />
<br />
It's still in the game, it's just disabled by default. to go the game menu -&gt; System -&gt; Voice and enable voice chat. Maybe they will remove it in 6.2.4? Or it'll be secondary to the B.net client, who knows. <br />
<br />
The reason it failed before was that you had to change toons, you had to reconfigure the chat all over again. Having it in the B.net app makes sense actually, as it would be separate from the game itself, much like Ventrillo or Mumble is now.</div></div><hr />

No more having to join some ones shitty voice server for pugs. My guild will continue to use our TS3 server, but that's because it servers a larger purpose than just wow.</div></div><hr />

2 weeks.<br />
<br />
Currently they are having huge battle.net problems and connectivity problems.<br />
<br />
Do the math.<br />
<br />
For a service no one used the first time they tried it.</div></div><hr />
