[anchor=swplat]Sunwell Plateau (25 Players)<br />
Note on Kil'jaeden loot : Nobody killed him yet, however he will most likely be the only one dropping ilvl 164 items. You can already check a few of them at the Sunwell vendor but I'll only list the 3 that really look like they drop from Kil'jaeden himself (based on their itemID mostly). <br />
Note on the &quot;Pre-PTR Leak&quot; : A lot of weapons stats have been leaked through this Sunwell Loot screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg) released before the PTR, so far nothing changed and you probably want to check it for items that aren't listed below yet. <br />
Note: Not all these items drop directly. Some of them are gained by exchanging one of the drops and a [item=34664] for a new item from the Shattered Sun Offensive vendor on the Sunwell Isle. These items are tagged with a (*).<br />

&#13;&#13;&lt;font face=arial size=2&gt;&#13;&#13;Fury of the Sunwell&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The glorious fount of arcane energy known as the Sunwell empowered the high elves for millennia, until the death knight Arthas laid siege to the elven kingdom and corrupted its sacred energies. Seeing no other alternative, a band of survivors led by Prince Kael’thas destroyed the ancient fount. Over time the surviving elves fell pray to a crippling magical withdrawal.<br />
<br />
&#13;Now, promising salvation for his people, Kael’thas has returned. Soon the Sunwell will shine once again, but whether the sacred fount will usher in deliverance or destruction remains to be seen.<br />

His work on D&amp;D was an inspiration to us in many ways and helped spark our passion for creating games of our own. As avid D&amp;D players and fellow game developers, we were all saddened by the news of his passing; we feel we’ve lost a true adventuring companion. &amp;#32;Thanks for everything and farewell, Gary. You will be missed.&#13;[/list]&#13;<br />

Instead, it increases the chance for all attacks to miss the Mage by 25% for 2/4 sec after Blink is cast.&#13; Using low ranks of Fire Ward and Frost Ward spell will now be penalized the same way healing spells are penalized.&#13; Frostbite: When a frost spell is reflected back at a Mage, it is now possible for the Mage to suffer from the Frostbite effect. &#13; Ice Barrier: Using low ranks of this spell will now be penalized the same way healing spells are penalized.&#13; Icy Veins no longer increases the chance your chilling effects will Freeze the target, but now increases the chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while casting any spell by 100% while active.&#13; Improved FireWard has become Molten Shields.&#13; Mana Shield: This spell will now get a percentage of the Mage’s bonus to spell damage as an additional effect.&#13; New Talent: Molten Shields will cause your Fire Ward to have a 10/20% chance to reflect Fire spells while active. &amp;#32;In addition, your Molten Armor has a 50/100% chance to affect ranged and spell attacks.&#13; Permafrost: This talent will now correctly increase the movement slowing effect of frost Armor instead of the attack speed slowing effect.&#13; Spellsteal will no longer overwrite a longer duration buff.&#13;[/list]&#13;<br />

This can be turned on from the right-click menu on your own portrait.&#13; In Master Loot mode, all players in the group will see sparkles on corpses that have loot above the master loot threshold. This lets everyone see what the master loot items are, though they cannot interact with them. Only the master looter can loot those items still.&#13; Searching for an item in the tradeskill search box should now hide empty categories.&#13; The names over the heads of nearby players who are on your friends list will appear in a different color now so you can tell when they are nearby.&#13; Stacked items for sale at the auction house now display the per unit price and per unit buyout price in the item mouseover.&#13; The profession UI search field has been improved and now allows for searching of more types of things. For instance you can search for items by socket color, by effect (&quot;Critical Strike&quot; for instance) or search gems by their effect (&quot;Strength&quot; for instance). In addition, the searching of items by level has been made more intuitive. You can now search for items by level with &quot;15-20&quot; to search for items that you can make that have a minimum level required of 15 to 20.&#13; The Tooltip for player Dodge/Block/Parry in the character sheet has been changed slightly.&#13; Optimized particle system rendering for improved frame rates.&#13; The casting bar will now display properly when casting Blizzard (mage) or Rain of Fire (warlock) with spell haste.&#13; For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the &lt;font color=&quot;#FF8000&quot;&gt;UI &amp; Macros Forum&lt;/font&gt; (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?sid=1&amp;forumId=11114).&#13;[/list]&#13;<br />

well conceivably someone like a rogue will definitely benefit from this. 21 honor per kill, just enter a BG, find the weakest clothie you can find and farm them until the BG ends making 1k honor per person lol.</div></div><hr />

riiiiiiiiight..... Anyway an actual bad scenario to this would be more GY camping for premades vs. pugs. I think thats really gonna suck. There's gonna be no way out. If i'm not mistaken they said honor will stop after 50 deaths. Cmon man 50??? thats way too high. it should be at most 25. I hope i dont stuck in any of these :/</div></div><hr />

From the looks of it, it gives 314 honor per quest completed, and one quest requires 4 tokens in total. So 314 honor per 4 tokens.<br />

Agreed. The main hand is nice, but what the hell is/was Blizzard thinking?<br />
&quot;Shaman aren't normalized, and rely primarily on Windfury.... so let's give them a fast offhand to compensate for the need of a slow mainhand! I'm a normalization genius!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yeah, cause pallies needed to have an easier time...<br />

Bloody kindergarten if you ask me. Where's the logic? Oh I forgot, Blizz left logic behind with TBC.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My money is that the set bonus scales with spell damage anyway.<br />
Anyway, it matches our T5 set in looks. Why the hell would they do that if it were a weapon intended mainly for rogues and Fury Warriors? I know that's how it turned out, but I'd like to hear the logic behind that.</div></div><hr />

It's rogues if anything, but most rogues won't touch it either. Swords are far superior unless you don't intend to spec combat.<br />
<br />
Shamans need a slow offhand and a slow mainhand, due to windfury mechanics. It's horrible for shamans.<br />
Warriors &quot;might&quot; go for it, but they have the same issue as shamans, they need a slow offhand, not a fast one.</div></div><hr />

And thus will be nerfed after two weeks after someone makes a thread on it on the official forums? :D<br />

<br />
Fury warriors make good use of slow weapons as well, but there is already a slow offhand available (Mounting Vengeance)... the most logical thing would IMO be to change the agility -&gt; strength, make the OH 2.7 as well, and redo Mounting Vengeance to cater to rogues.<br />
<br />
Bbr has some valid points but they CAN, to the best of my knowledge, make use of faster offhands, it's basically the flurry 'feature' vs slightly more rage, not sure if either of them is defenitely better at this level of raiding.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yasuhiko</div><div class="date">2008-03-26, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I'd gladly give up Mounting Vengeance for that OH being 2.7 speed.<br />
But yeah, I know Fury warriors that argue both slow and fast OH, and both do very well for themselves. I mean, if Blizzard decided to de-normalize us, or buffed Flametongue some (to the point where WF/FT beat WF/WF, but FT wasn't Mh viable) maybe. Even then, as I put in the other thread, 1.5 isn't a good speed for FT, either.</div></div><hr />

It now reduces casting time by about 1/6 (estimated, my 1.5 sec cast became 1.25) and can be used for the whole duration, not just for one spell. I also believe the CD for it was shortened. Anyway, RIP my soul fire :(</div></div><hr />

never had a blue gem, but green gems. Did a lot of pick pocketing when spinesever wasn't nerfed.<br />
<br />
The half cast time meta grants spell haste, it was known before.</div></div><hr />
