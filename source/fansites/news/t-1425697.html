Armory Stats - Legendary Quest Line Achievements<br />
Today we are taking a look at the legendary quest achievement completion rate of players. Now that achievements are account wide, we can group characters by account and get an idea of what percentage of players (not characters) have completed an achievement.<br />
<br />
In this case, the final achievement requires you to obtain a legendary cloak, kill Garrosh, and finally complete a quest. This means that the number of players who have the legendary cloak is slightly higher than the number who have the final achievement, as some players have killed Garrosh, have the cloak, but never did the quest. <br />
<br />
The data used today is a sample of 5.7 million characters from 2 million accounts, with at least one character on the account that was active after Nov 15. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are much less likely to appear in our sample. You can leave suggestions for future stat posts in the comments!<br />

Armory Stats - Legendary Weapon Feat of Strength Achievements<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
We have finally gone through all of the tweets made by Ghostcrawler (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/) while he was still a developer. Now he is off on a beach somewhere (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412692088895983616/photo/1/large), but still offering his opinion (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414819543597334528) on Twitter. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/7666760.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polldaddy.com/poll/7666760/&quot;&gt;Would you like to see Ghostcrawler tweets? (Not mixed in with the Blue Tweets, but in their own section)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;<br />
<br />
If you want to follow or contact the developers on Twitter, take a look at Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon) (PvE), Holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka) (PvP), Chris Robinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson) (Art), Dave Kosak (https://twitter.com/davekosak) (Story), Dave Maldonado (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo) (Game Design).<br />
<br />
Classes <br />
Base damage/healing on spells is removed too. All from scaling. Equal scaling for all! (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407642737664483328))<br />
Curious, naked casters have 0 spellpower now; will base intellect give spellpower in 6.0?<br />
Likely, yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407985649023582208))<br />
<br />
How do you decide which spells to remove from classes? Consecration and auras were core features to paladins. Totems to shamans<br />
It's tough; every ability is special to somebody. Generally, cut what takes up keybinds, but isn't needed to make it fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407973492550688768))<br />
I realize that's rather vague. It's a very subjective question. Preserving and improving gameplay is the primary goal here. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407973701498322944))<br />
<br />
Would you gentleman be willing to touch on what abilities, (or types of abilities) you've looking at removing in WoD?<br />
We're currently exploring removing CC abilities and redundant DPS/healing cooldowns. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407588872864808960))<br />
if you remove cc abilities it's gonna take 95% of coordination out of the game.. just run in and do dmg..<br />
He didn't mean *all* CC abilities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407593422715764736))<br />
Yeah &quot;some CC abilities&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407595446740074496))<br />
Care to give one example you guys are discussing?<br />
Not really :-D This is a case where if you only see one class's changes, that class will freak. Whole picture needed (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407655696268681217))<br />
Can you give us the whole picture? <br />
Soon™. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407656872594784256))<br />
Really looking forward to what you come up with nevertheless.<br />
It will be iterative and obviously balance won't be perfect from the start. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407659455258456064))<br />
Hoping for an agile beta testing phase! <br />
It will be important for us to get a lot of testing &amp; feedback during beta. Want to encourage alot of participation (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407690134969020417))<br />
<br />
removing any CC is a design shift away from strategic dungeon gameplay. Warlords of Faceroll<br />
I think you misunderstood what Holinka was saying. See further tweets with clarification. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407632059180388353))<br />
how else can 'removing (some) CC abilities' be interpreted? Are there just too many?<br />
Yes, most definitely. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407632870929219584))<br />
Jumping from [Removing some of the tons of CC] to [Dungeons no longer require strategy] is a humongous (incorrect) leap. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407634070944743424))<br />
this would impact both pve and pvp, yes? Will dungeons require CC? Strategy?<br />
There will still be CC, and it will still be just as strategically valuable in dungeons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407634289765797889))<br />
as a prot warrior feeling marginalized in my role, removing CC only exacerbates those feelings. Like tanks only matter 4 raiding<br />
Not at all the case. Tanks are definitely needed for dungeons. Not sure how this affects that at all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407635301029273601))<br />
tanks in 5 mans are only relevant in the beginning, gear overtakes and healing and dps survivability reign.<br />
A) I'd disagree with that until there's an absolutely massive gear difference. B) What does removing some CC have to do with that? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407636103093444608))<br />
<br />
What do you think about squishing mana to a solid 1000? Huge numbers make no sense when it's static anyway!<br />
It'll be squished to something comparable to health. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407608379981299712))<br />
<br />
Note that rogues don't have redundant dps cooldowns, that is all!<br />
We actually like DPS cooldowns that have gameplay changes (e.g. Shadowdance) than &quot;Moar damage&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407656752532836352))<br />
<br />
Absolutely, we saw that in Mists but I'm just cautioning that I'm afraid of where it may lead. I really like AM.<br />
We really like Active Mitigation as well; it's turned out quite well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407603572029665280))<br />
<br />
a while back mr said hunters / rogues would get an overhaul next x-pac, just wondering if still happening? Thanks!<br />
&quot;Overhaul&quot;, no. We want to better distinguish their different specs. That's not an &quot;overhaul&quot; at all, though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407602399398752256))<br />
<br />
Why does encounter design come first, rather than class balance?Encounters don't require insane dmg&gt; players don't need insane dmg<br />
They are pretty interwoven and there's a lot of back and forth between the two teams. The class team has a lot of customers. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407589134400634880))<br />

I never want to go back to Jab Jab Uplift, I just like how the two styles integrate easily.<br />
The problem is cherrypicking. Don't want to allow you to pick the best parts of both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407609885275078656))<br />
Thus, we need to have some cost to switching modes. Doesn't take much; 1 GCD may suffice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407610171888660480))<br />
Would FW still maintain the &quot;DPS healer&quot; model that we were sold on? Will it be &quot;viable?&quot;<br />
Yes. Separate stance allows us to balance it separately. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407610884203114496))<br />
Is this going to make mistweaving gimped w/o stance swapping to fist?<br />
Gimped? At what? Maximum HPS is purely Mistweaving, no Fistweaving. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407611435053613056))<br />
<br />
So to clarify... If I want to heal I have to channel?<br />
If you want to do maximum HPS, yes, Mistweavers gameplay involves channeling. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407610571354165248))<br />
<br />
Just to add to this, what do you plan on doing with fistweaving?<br />
Both are large concerns that we intend to address. Preserving Fistweaving, but it'll be a separate stance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407606761344868353))<br />
Wait wait wait, by seperate stance do you mean SotFT? Will FW be energy based?<br />
No, new stance. No, still mana. No, not at all like Chakra. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407608081556582400))<br />
Are you aiming to keep the same seamless fusion between DPS and healing. I miss 5.0 fw. <br />
What do you mean by 'seamless fusion'? If you mean Jab-Jab-Uplift, no. No cherrypicking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407608846828326912))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
Hiya! Quick Question, so you have fistweaving, and atonement. Any plans for a paladin (seems a natch) or druid version in WoD?<br />
Druids already have it in Dream of Cenarius. Seal of Faith is doing that for Paladins, though in a different way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/407985137645666304))<br />
Seal of Faith=terrible talent, scrap it<br />
I suppose that's better feedback than none at all, but reasoning and thoughts would be even better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408005167259217920))<br />
Unless you give holy a reliable baseline dps HP generator. /4<br />
Assume you have access to all of the spec's builders/finishers that you want. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408009266130190336))<br />
Holy does not have a reliable dps builder.We have to spec SH for Judgment to grant HP&amp;crusader strike is not reliable<br />
How is Crusader Strike not reliable? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408010230014816256))<br />
We don't have melee mechanics immunity for one.<br />
OK, what if you did, with Seal of Faith? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408010898716901377))<br />
I'd spec the talent to gain said immunity and use Insight anyway.<br />
I sincerely doubt that you'd give up your other lvl 100 talents for that. Could make it only work while active. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408011760776400896))<br />
Can seal swap dance if required on dangerous mechanic. Besides lvl 100 talents for H Pala = bad/situational<br />
Let's try to back up a step. Don't get stuck in 'how' nitpicking. Feedback on the general intent of the talent? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408015942384234496))<br />
The biggest issue is that, as a paladin, DPS-based healing doesn't feeling natural.<br />
How so? It'd be new functionality that you're not used to, but that could be said for anything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408012379369115648))<br />
Talenting into Stance Dancing just sounds horrible period in both feel and power.<br />
The intent is no dancing. It's a committed thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408018020800270336))<br />
You can't really expect a healer not to dance, too many variables in a fight<br />
You can expect them not to dance if they aren't able to. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408018252023885824))<br />

Obviously 20% of all players having the legendary is still far higher than the 4% drop chance from previous gear. What I would find interesting would be a comparison between the Cloaks and other legendaries from when they were current (so % of warrior/paladin/death knight with Shadowmourne when it was current, % of paladin/priest/shaman with Val'yar, % of rogues with Fangs of the Father and % of Mage, Druid, Warlock, Shadow Priest, Elemental Shaman with Dragonwrath).</div></div><hr />

<br />
We could do something like that with the achievement date on Fangs of the Father (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6181-fangs-of-the-father) and others with achievements, but the problem is all of the people that got them and quit playing will make the numbers look lower than they really were.<br />
<br />
e: I looked really quick, even not including the date it was earned, just active since Nov 15, and there are still only 33,780 players with that achievement that still play. Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/5839-dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest) has 39,380. Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/428-thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker) has 110,943. Shadowmourne (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/4623-shadowmourne) has 31,264. Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3142-valanyr-hammer-of-ancient-kings) has 12,517. Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/725-thoridal-the-stars-fury) has 65,657. Warglaives of Azzinoth (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/426-warglaives-of-azzinoth) has 46,327. Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/425-atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian) has 419. Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/429-sulfuras-hand-of-ragnaros) has 96,569.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could use another piece of data to work out what characters were active at the time as well?<br />
<br />
The problem is that almost all character profiles from before Patch 5.3 or 5.4 are gone from the armory now due to data changes that wipe profiles until you log in again.</div></div><hr />

I would welcome it if we could but I doubt that it will happen. Now it will likely be more like &quot;OMFG. EVERY NOOB COULD HAVE HAD A CLOAK&quot; and then some comment about lazy players who won't work hard in a video game. Yeah, I'm that cynical but let's not whisper it around.<br />
<br />
20% seems about right to me for a legendary that was really open to anyone who wanted it. It also speaks in a roundabout way to the fact that only one in five players was interested enough in having what is a really spectacular piece of gear statwise to do the grind for it.</div></div><hr />

The entire chain can be done with the lfr queue system, Openraid and OQ. I am on a dead server and had zero issue with it, and got my cloak day 1 of the patch. The only thing stopping you is yourself.<br />

Getting your team to do the objectives and stay together is like herding cats. Pve players should never be forced to pvp. Pvp players should never be forced to pve. I'm sure the pvpers didn't enjoy noobs in pve gear coming into their bgs and messing it up too.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to play the character then you will complete it in time. I dont see what the fuss is on a character that you are not going to play much on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Barely half the population bothered to do the first part with the numbers quickly falling by over half. At least based on that data the purpose of getting the majority engaged with the quest line to keep players consistently subscribed by doing that chain has shown to be a failure. It doesnt matter if you are a &quot;casual&quot; that did the chain, you are still among a minority that bothered to complete it.<br />
<br />
20% of players have the cloak, and that is skewed towards people that have a guild etc etc.<br />

The intent was to get far more people involved. What this shows is not that much people care to get it done and it didnt have to be made around the idea for the majority when only a minority was going to do it anyways. It also caused problems else where. Personally I would be more interested in a vanity item like a mount that would be useful expansions later and doesnt cause needless drama between the haves and have nots.</div></div><hr />

I dont understand the need for inflated mana numbers anymore if theres no way to change them outside of the character level. There should be litterally 0 difference in healing whether you have 2000 mana, or 200000 mana, so what is the point of mana going up as you level if every single spell is % based (thanks to them revamping the spell level system), and mana is no longer influenced by gear. All they are doing is creating redundant numbers to look at that in no way influence how the game is played. If a spell requires 8% mana at lvl 20, then at lvl 90 its still at 8% , only you just see the numerical values instead ( 80 mana vs 8xxx mana ) . <br />
<br />
Wouldnt it just be much easier to tone it down like rage , energy and focus bars and give mana a fixed 100 or 1000 value for all levels? Since the increase of mana is a moot point when all spells use the exact same % of the mana bars, it serves no use other than to make players &quot;feel' like their mana is going up. This will help clear up spirit as well, so it will be much easier to gauge just how much spirit is really helping you, without having to do long division.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. No, no, and hell no. The storylines surrounding the legendaries are epic and should be available for every player to experience for him/herself. I loved doing Sulfuras and Thunderfury. Working my way to Illidan and finally acquiring his iconic Warglaives brought a feeling of being a part of Azeroth's history. (Thori'dal is the exception, as it still has very vague lore for it. Even Val'anyr has more.) I haven't finished Shadowmourne or Dragonwrath yet, and will probably never acquire the Fangs (I don't like rogue combat), but what I've seen and read still gives me pleasure. I even admit that the storyline for the legendary cloaks was worth it overall. (I loathe PvP...)<br />
<br />
I am still bitter over Atiesh - not because I can't lord myself over other players, but because Atiesh is an iconic mage item with deep history. I would have enjoyed working my way through its story because my mage is still my main character nine years later. The personal fulfillment would be the reward, and having the item would be a way of always remembering the experience.<br />
<br />
Taking away future players' opportunity to experience and create long-lasting memories that deeply connect them into lore is bad. Yes, it creates exclusivity, but is exclusivity which is created solely from playing during a certain time period a good thing? My answer is never. (Which is why I truly hate old Azeroth's content revamps.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same feelings when blizzard removed the ability to do the vanilla class epic quests from molten core. Earning my Benediction was a great feeling, both because of how rare it was to see one, and because of how hard it was to complete the questline, plus it was just enjoyable to do it. Just like with watching a hunter do his/her kitting in ungoro , it was something that players of all levels got to be part of. Being distracted from your leveling and getting to watch a lvl 60 do something extremely hard, as well as bringing many players from the same server together in trying to figure out the best ways to do the quests, or how to even complete them, congratulations included, from players of the same class made the communities that little bit closer together.<br />
<br />
Sure it wouldnt have that same feeling nowadays, but considering how engaging those questlines were, in the same manner of getting rag or thunderfury, I never understood why they just removed them entirely, and yet left the other important achievements intact, like making the legendaries or the ZG/AQ coins, dolls, etc.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to be consistent about removing things like that, they should have just removed all of the old raid instances as well.<br />
<br />
They really should have just left everything alone. It boggles my mind.</div></div><hr />

The most disappointing thing I heard at Blizzcon was the devs saying they were happy with the legendary and that they'd do it again in WoD. It made switching mains impossible since you were severely gimped not having the cloak. Hey we need you on your pally now. Ok see you in 12 weeks. It also made alts a pain in the ass. They should have made it boa. I'm against anything that restricts me from changing classes based on what my guild needs. I hope they scrap the legendary in WoD.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selenti</div><div class="date">2013-12-23, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. No, no, and hell no. The storylines surrounding the legendaries are epic and should be available for every player to experience for him/herself. I loved doing Sulfuras and Thunderfury. Working my way to Illidan and finally acquiring his iconic Warglaives brought a feeling of being a part of Azeroth's history. (Thori'dal is the exception, as it still has very vague lore for it. Even Val'anyr has more.) I haven't finished Shadowmourne or Dragonwrath yet, and will probably never acquire the Fangs (I don't like rogue combat), but what I've seen and read still gives me pleasure. I even admit that the storyline for the legendary cloaks was worth it overall. (I loathe PvP...)<br />
<br />
I am still bitter over Atiesh - not because I can't lord myself over other players, but because Atiesh is an iconic mage item with deep history. I would have enjoyed working my way through its story because my mage is still my main character nine years later. The personal fulfillment would be the reward, and having the item would be a way of always remembering the experience.<br />
<br />
Taking away future players' opportunity to experience and create long-lasting memories that deeply connect them into lore is bad. Yes, it creates exclusivity, but is exclusivity which is created solely from playing during a certain time period a good thing? My answer is never. (Which is why I truly hate old Azeroth's content revamps.)<br />
<br />
My feeling is that if people want to just &quot;experience the content&quot;, why not just produce WoW as a singleplayer game? It would serve the same function. I happen to think MMOs should cater to the strengths of the format. The most memorable moments I had with the game were either getting things that were super hard to get, or achieving things that were close to impossible. When everyone can do it, what's the point? Where's the excitement?<br />
<br />
Even when you can't get those things (ESPECIALLY, I'd argue), the allure of there being things you can strive for that most people will never reach is a huge part of what made early MMOs special. I realize this isn't a very popular viewpoint, but whatever. That's my preference.<br />
<br />
WoW has gone the complete opposite direction over the years, so I suppose the market has spoken. I guess I'm in the minority, and a minority that isn't worth producing products for, from a profitability standpoint.</div></div><hr />

That is very much NOT &quot;a big deal.&quot; I'd have rather the requirement been to win TWENTY battlegrounds than that grind for 6,000 valor points, or whatever the amount was.<br />

Not posting results seemed pretty shady but maybe they're trying to avoid bias by not displaying it - can't check in advance to see the popular opinion or whatever. <br />

Idiotic dev who came up with pvping for a pve item should be fired. I did it twice but each time was a nightmare that took me 10 tries to get one win. Getting your team to do the objectives and stay together is like herding cats. Pve players should never be forced to pvp. Pvp players should never be forced to pve. I'm sure the pvpers didn't enjoy noobs in pve gear coming into their bgs and messing it up too.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was why I stopped. As soon as I heard that it required pvp I gave up on it.<br />
<br />
I despise WoW pvp with a burning hatred. I do not pay to not be able to play. Blizzard can come to my house and wash the damn dishes for all I care I will not play it.<br />

I voted no because I'm sick and tired of the glorification of Greg Street, everyone seems to forget he was a lead for the biggest subscription loss in WoW history maybe even MMO history. Yet it's seldom mentioned. <br />
-gutting professions<br />
-Original Cata dungeons<br />
-Talent overhall<br />
-homogenization of classes<br />
-train track levelling paths<br />
<br />
Just to name a few, why is there never any mention of these things? He was present for all of them. His main goal (imo) was the reduction of development costs more than anything else. Not to mention the fact his habit of saying whatever needed to quell the frothing masses even if it wasn't true.<br />
After he took over they systematically set about removing everything that made the game what it was while crying about &quot;resources&quot;.<br />
<br />
He was and is not the &quot;great&quot; game developer everyone seems to think, he was a corporate mouthpiece plain and simple. Anyone who has spent any time in the corporate world would recognize it.</div></div><hr />

(emphasis mine)<br />
<br />
I don't want my enjoyment to come at the cost of other players' enjoyment of the game. I think the biggest reason for your dissatisfaction (I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, just trying to explain what I'm thinking) is that LFR - which pretty much is a solo experience - was allowed to drop legendary-related quest items. I actually agree with you on that part. It should have been a group effort with people you would actually see again and collaborate with. Unfortunately, changes made in Cataclysm and furthered in Mists made it very unlikely that the previous statement would ever be workable in practice.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the result has been a legendary that only reminds me of the god-awful soloing experience (minus killing the commander... until Blizzard nerfed it) because Cataclysm destroyed most of my realm's raid guilds and MoP destroyed even more Normal-only raid guilds and PvP-in-my-PvE-what-the-@^#$ (hey Blizz, I re-rolled on a PvE server for a reason!) and if I wanted a true group then I had to use third-party tools to accomplish it. Overall, I look at my cloak and kinda feel disgusted in the end.<br />
<br />
I don't mind - and actually would prefer - if Blizzard goes back to making legendary-quality items somewhat more exclusive in current content. My biggest objection to your post was the remark about removing such items - and necessarily all related quests - after it was no longer current content. I feel the removal of content is always a bad thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
This statistics for weapons are &quot;fault&quot; because they should only count those that got the weapons on their respective expansion time...<br />
<br />
This would only work for legendary items introduced in Wrath of the Lich King onwards because the achievement system didn't exist until Wrath.</div></div><hr />

Took me 5 years, almost every week, to get my second Thunderfury binding, and about the same time farming Ragnaros for the Eye of Sulfuras.<br />
<br />
I saw Death Knights who had both before the end of Wrath of the Lich King, RNG is RNG and that's kinda the problem with the previous legendaries. At least Shadowmourne had less RNG involved.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. This just makes the protest against transmog legendaries (especially from the developers) &quot;OMG everyone with Thunderfury!!!!11&quot; seem incredibly ridiculous. I didn't know less than one percent of the highest recorded population (and likely a small fraction of even that overall considering the high turnover) was &quot;everyone.&quot; And Thunderfury is the most common legendary, others are even lower than that. It's just silly. It's time for the silliness to end.</div></div><hr />

In a fair world I would presume that it would be close to 1:1 although I do realize that one account could do Shadowmourne multiple times to get multiple Deathchargers and sell to an account lacking Shadowmourne. However my guess is that the number of accounts with Deathchargers dwarfs the amount of accounts with Shadowmournes due to the alleged sale of &quot;duped&quot; Deathchargers of years past.</div></div><hr />
