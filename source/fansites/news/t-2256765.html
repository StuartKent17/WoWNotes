Doesn't seem there was a mythic only phase here. Just that the normal mechanics happened non-stop and so strongly it looks like Blizzard is trolling us.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but it's also rather meaningless that it took them more attempts as raid was full cleared in less time than it took to full clear Mythic Nighthold, by nearly a week. This means they geared faster and had more time to spend on pulls.</div></div><hr />

appears Spookiie didnt got his achievement (but his progression still says 9/9)</div></div><hr />

Most of the 635 wipes were probably on the bugged version of KJ, after last fix it was 4 days of real progress on boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm no?<br />
<br />
Mythic Nighthold opened on 24th of January, and Guldan was killed on 4th of February, thats 11 days.<br />
<br />
Mythic Tomb opened on 27th of June, and KJ was killed 16th of July, thats 19 days.<br />
<br />
So it took more time to full clear tomb than it took to full clear NH by 8 days.</div></div><hr />

When every single player is basically of equal skill you end up bringing the class that is best for the situation since everyone will be performing at the maximum level regardless of class.</div></div><hr />

Well that came out retarded, but this site lags a bit sometimes so that's not what I was trying to get across, but rather that them and a lot of other top end guilds did a more casual raid schedule this tier for the mythic race and focused on gearing up from split pushes. So they spent less of their time in the race actually raiding mythic compared to last tier.<br />
<br />
They also sped through their clear to KJ very quickly these last two weeks, so they had more time to focus and get in more pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 days is a very long time to get a WF kill in today's standards. To put it in perspective, H Rag only took a little longer to kill than KJ and Paragon thought that it was the hardest boss ever made at the time.</div></div><hr />

member how that was like 8 years ago?<br />
<br />
blizzard has said time and time again this exp that they want people to bring the class<br />
<br />
it was also not because of class stacking that that philosophy was created<br />
but because of stuff like class specific buffs (arcane intelect, motw etc) or shaman totems, etc that made it an absolute requirement to have all of those classes even on regular raiding/etc let alone world first progress</div></div><hr />

They're racing for a world first and playing in a unconventional way. Of course they'll class stack if needed and far from every guild has the option to class stack in this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, in the current patch AP is basically irrelevant. That still leaves titanforged perfectly itemized gear and legendaries(although most mains have them all by now). So basically we're just past the point where they matter, that doesn't mean they weren't awful for the first 6 months of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How does what these guilds are doing apply in any shape or form to the 99.9% of guilds out there that don't play at this level...?<br />
<br />
These players perform at levels where they can afford to class stack, since the players will get the most out of that class. The rest of the raiding community doesn't exactly reach such levels of conscistency</div></div><hr />

Every single raider of the main team in Method has 5 alts around same gear and AP level. Not only that, wiping on mythic bosses doesn't yield you any AP</div></div><hr />

That applies to 99 percent of the player base. Regardless removing buffs is enough for that to be true. There will always be some imbalance.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that has never been a statement to the world first race, that is 100% viable for every guild not in the top 5~ though. <br />

yes they all play one class<br />
<br />
also im betting my left ball that they dont all play rogues, seeing as it took them half the expansion to fix even the most basic issues with the class<br />

not to mention how rogues arent even overtuned like at all<br />

5 rogues 5 druids, standard<br />
<br />
at least they are different rolls. tanks, heals, dps.<br />
<br />
how about that rogue rogue rogue rogue rouge....hunter hunter hunter....setup<br />
<br />
guess immunities are king this race.<br />
<br />
look at all their other kills, not really a huge druid problem. they switch tank around a lot. even brewmaster :P<br />
just two things are consistent. immunity and rogues<br />

Yeah, remember the outrage when they annouced Concordance? Without it people would either no-life mythic+/wq until cap or just AP items would become totaly useless and we would have to sell it like junk until end of expac. Now AP items still have some use, but no one expect you to no-life this, even most hardcore guilds.</div></div><hr />

me and you do it, its bannable. just like selling runs and gear for real money. bannable. but hey if its part of something blizzard benefits from. A-OK<br />
I have 5 toons that are all 915-930ish I lvl, my main has concordance in all specs, and all of them have 56-58 points in their main spec, and working on a 6th toon that is currently 910 I lvl and nearly has concodance in 2 specs. And I'm casual, I don't even log in daily let alone raid more than extremely casually and not consistent at all on anything other than my main, they are very much not casual, they actually get paid to play and actually run multiple raids with different alts to gear them up. You don't know wtf you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

So they spent less of their time in the race actually raiding mythic compared to last tier.<br />
<br />
They also sped through their clear to KJ very quickly these last two weeks, so they had more time to focus and get in more pulls.<br />
<br />
that's not what happened method, exorsus and maybe some other guilds raided as hardcore as usual 12-14 hours a day for the past 3 weeks. they always do splits to gear up characters.</div></div><hr />

good for you, they spend half the time gearing toons since they split run everything and about 10hrs a day wiping on mythic bosses and that gives no ilvl or ap.<br />

First off I didn't say 58 on 5 toons I said 56-58, second you're obviously not a very experienced player sitting here trying to argue and all you come up with is &quot;they must account share&quot;! Method doesn't even raid every day outside of progress and that's done, was not even 3 weeks and afaik they didn't day raid this tier. You just don't know how to efficiently maximize your time spent in game, it is as a matter of fact possible now and has been for several weeks now to have more than a few ranks in concordance with just ap from weekly m+ chest, world quests, and order hall missions, none of that takes a whole lot of time to do, and you don't need to even play daily to do all of that without missing anything important really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe try waiting when someone is obviously editing a post, they don't raid daily outside of progress. Leveling up toons doesn't take that long actually, nor does gearing them up to be raid ready when you have a guild of the best players in the world and a good system in place to minimize the amount of time it takes to do this. <br />

Never-have-beens counter more difficult encounters now than the &quot;has-beens&quot; did back then. Hell, LFR-players do. <br />

Orly? So what else makes raids difficult then? Let me guess... logistics? :rolleyes:. Logistics during Legion have been quite the demanding factor for the world first raiders though. <br />

Gearing up for them for one. You couldn't just mechanics your way through Vanilla raids, even without the bugs. It took a very long time just to gear your raid up. <br />

It doesn't take all that much time now that players know where to go and where things drop. Add to that the fact that players also know a whole lot more these days about class mechanics, and you're hilariously wrong. Was it challenging for its time? Sure thing. Is it challenging by today's metrics? Fuck no.<br />
<br />
Normal retail raiders go to Private servers to raid on off nights &quot;for the lols&quot; for a reason. <br />
<br />
You can go away, your song is delusional and old. Raiding has evolved, and whilst Legion's demanded quite a bit on the logistics side, the raid encounters are what offers the challenge. As it should be.</div></div><hr />

Actually it does because the bosses only dropped 2 fucking items. And you had 40 fucking people. There wasn't a mechanical difficulty involved in clearing fucking Molten Core. It was 100% the sheer length of time it took to get gear that made it take so fucking long to clear, unless you were just in a bad guild, or on a bad realm with a low population or some shit then sure it might have taken you longer, but even for people that knew what the fuck they were doing then, and make no mistake there were definitely guilds full of very hardcore gamers back then too, it took months to clear that shit.</div></div><hr />

Um, no it doesn't. RNG is shit, yes, but time is not finite to reach max level and get ready as it was back then. Still didn't stop guilds from padding their raid teams with 15 members and seeing kills though way back when. You think Method would've gotten world first carrying an equal percentage for padding?<br />

You don't get anything at all that I'm talking about, all you are doing is assuming that you know what I think while you make blatantly wrong statements about what raiding in Vanilla wow was even like. Just because people can do the mechanics now in their sleep (and believe me they did it back then too) does not suddenly change the fact that it took a very long time to get geared up in Vanilla wow to even clear Molten Core, it's not just RNG either, it's the sheer fact that very little gear dropped at all and there were zero catch up mechanics, you had to wait for that reset and share the little bit of table scraps with a lot more people.<br />
<br />
Because of this, and the amount of time it took to even level up and get geared enough to get attuned so that you could enter Molten Core, it still took 4 months before a Ragnaros kill even happened, and no that shit wasn't because a couple people were carrying everyone else, there are fucking kill videos of that World First kill and everyone is doing their shit proper. It's also boring as fuck to watch and it was even more boring to play when it was cutting edge content, but you're talking straight out of your ass if you are trying to define wow as a more difficult game now than it ever was in the past. Not even. It was a very different game, and it was difficult for very different reasons, this idea that there were not very top notch guilds back then that were well organized and knew wtf they were doing however is complete bull. <br />
<br />
So when you come in here saying something along the lines of &quot;Method could have cleared this faster!&quot; You come as rather ridiculous, because a lot of them were there and they weren't clearing it any faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think anyone denies the time it took and the logistics behind when it was current to the playerbase of that time. What is being denied, is that it'd somehow pose a challenge by today's standards, not those of 2004. <br />
<br />
And no, I'm not speaking &quot;out of my ass&quot;, players whom couldn't perform 2-button rotations back then, still got to see kills because they'd simply been able to put in more time than others and get some pieces of gear. I have plenty of reports from players raiding back then whom have no stake in trying to pass off their active time in this game as &quot;the most challenging epitome of skill cap requirement!!&quot;, + experience, although a lot of players will then pull the &quot;Classic servers are not like the true experience!&quot;-card... <br />
<br />
If a raid was released with MC mechanics today, every raiding guild would clear it within hours of its release. If the logistics were also made to be like they were back then, it'd take players longer than a few hours no doubt, but I'm pretty sure that the world first's would be ready well in time for when the raid released either way... Not that anyone would bother if they released a raid with Classic mechanics trying to pass it off as passable content.</div></div><hr />

Um, no. My point remains, raiding today is more challenging than it ever was. You believe logistics being a pain should be the lion's share of what makes raiding? Fine by me. Doesn't change the fact that raiding difficulty has been about challenging mechanics rather than the logistics side since TBC onward, making it very much the standard for the game.<br />

My point remains, raiding today is more challenging than it ever was. You believe logistics being a pain should be the lion's share of what makes raiding? Fine by me. Doesn't change the fact that raiding difficulty has been about challenging mechanics rather than the logistics side since TBC onward, making it very much the standard for the game.<br />

No I don't believe Vanilla was a more difficult experience at all, I didn't say anything like this, read what I write and respond to it or shuht the fuck up I do not mince words, I am clearly spoken and if you had a modicum of self awareness you'd realize the only issue here is that YOU do believe that the game right now is the epitome of any challenge there has ever been in this game and that's just a ridiculous thing to say, it's just not even the same game at all anymore.

<br />
Raid encounters are more challenging now than before, fact. The encounters still manage to challenge top players with each new tier though, meaning that the goalpost is flexible. As a raider, this is what raiding is about to me. Mechanical difficulty.<br />
<br />
Get over it, I'll continue to know that raiding difficulty has only gone upwards. Logistics around raiding don't even factor into my view on a raid, mechanics do. I'll also continue laughing at the has-beens whom can't even handle class mechanics let alone raid mechanics these days as they keep singing their &quot;the game was only challenging back when I played!&quot;-song. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Farming mobs for resistance gear isn't really challenging though. At all. I think you're confusing difficult with time consuming. Putting a 2 month gearing timegate is simply a tedious way to prolong content and create artificial difficulty, nothing more. Mechanics in today's raids are far more challenging than mechanics of vanilla, and you can count the 11 weeks of BS quests as getting resistance gear , same time taken , same difficulty.</div></div><hr />

I am not confused at all, the word difficult does not only mean something that requires skill. Example: going through military boot camp does not require a lot of skill at all but it requires a lot of effort and would not be accurately described as easy, it is definitely difficult.</div></div><hr />

You know that's been total bullshit since always right? Everyone thought Ghostcrawler played a mage thus they were OP forever when in reality he played a Holy Priest. <br />

I don't get how people still believe this shit. As if multi million dollar game developers are so stupid that they balance the game in favor of what class they like to play the most.<br />

<br />
It doesn't take all that much time now that players know where to go and where things drop. Add to that the fact that players also know a whole lot more these days about class mechanics, and you're hilariously wrong. Was it challenging for its time? Sure thing. Is it challenging by today's metrics? Fuck no.<br />
<br />
Normal retail raiders go to Private servers to raid on off nights &quot;for the lols&quot; for a reason. <br />
<br />
You can go away, your song is delusional and old. Raiding has evolved, and whilst Legion's demanded quite a bit on the logistics side, the raid encounters are what offers the challenge. As it should be.<br />
<br />
Damn man. You sound so bitter than you weren't around in the old days of WoW. I mean shit your forum sig and location combined with your posts are giving you away so easily. You act as if you're really threatened by people who don't like today's WoW. I don't know why you care what they think. And you don't have proof of how many subs WoW has right now so your sig is just a lie. <br />
<br />
It's just weird to me. I see people who think MoP was the best time in WoW and I think it was the absolute worst. But the difference is I'm not constantly trying to debate with them to prove that I'm right.</div></div><hr />

if they did a good job of balancing, people don't need to reroll, no re-grinding and farming everything all over again = less content.<br />

<br />
He's not spot on, first off he was ignoring points I was actually making and making ridiculous assumptions about what he thinks I think and overlooking everything I said even though I was just laying out facts about what the game was like and not giving my opinion at all.<br />
<br />
The main problem is that yourself, him and others on this forum seem to fail at reading comprehension and the English language. I never said that Vanilla raid bosses were harder or something like that, but you keep repeating about how bosses today are harder and then when someone brings up how the game was otherwise difficulty you foam at the mouth about how the game had no difficulty to at all because it required no skillz!<br />
<br />
And what that means is that you are quite pathetic to have some need to force your opinion about the game down other people's throats in this manner, and also that you do not comprehend basic English. I broke this down very simply to you people already. And it does not matter if you agree or not I am correct and what I am talking about is not open to debate, I am only talking facts here. I never gave my opinion about the game.<br />
<br />
The first think you need to get through your skull is that the simple word difficult does not mean &quot;requires skill&quot; the simple definition is something requiring effort or skill. Climbing fucking Mount Everest does not require you to be a skilled survivalist or climber by any means, anyone can join an expedition and do that these days, but it is something that requires a lot of fucking effort and isn't easy to do. <br />
<br />
You and that fool aren't even arguing about things that were even brought up here by other people, you're just straight up talking right out of your ass about things you clearly didn't even experience yourself. And not only that you are talking down to people that are more experienced than you with the current game as well as the past and that makes you look even more foolish. That fool didn't make it past Mythic Krosus in Nighthold, I was on Gul'dan before TOS launched. <br />
<br />
But somehow this less skilled and experienced player who fails to understand basic English does not only know more about the game he has less experience playing, he can read people's minds too? <br />
<br />
He's a bottom tier Mythic Raider arguing straight out of his ass. It's beyond stupid. Y'all young and inexperienced gamers who think you don't look incredibly foolish right now because this realm is full of Cata/MOP babies just like you that think they're playing a more difficult game on the whole than any of us ever played before.<br />
<br />
You're damn right I think the game on the whole is easier now, because it fucking is. In previous iterations of this game it was never even possible to outgear the content you were trying to clear while it was still the cutting edge content of the game. That's the norm now. In previous interations of the game you couldn't bring whatever class comp you wanted. I'm not sitting here presenting my opinion as a player that hasn't even played this entire game since day 1 as a fact though, and the thing is the complexity of the boss mechanics isn't the only thing in this game, there's more to this game than just those bosses and you can't just put them in a bubble outside of the rest of the game and measure which is harder than the other without the context of the rest of the game, it doesn't work that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually almost the same for me. Even though I raid with my main (pretty casual still though right now) I still have 3 910+ Alts and almost every other class beside my not 110 warlock and my freshly dinged Monk at 900~ with almost no time spent. Three Alts having Concordance.<br />
<br />
Gearing is easy as fuck right now. Doesn't cost any time at all. You just have to play efficient. AFK'ing in Dalaran is not efficient for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has always existed and will always exist. Blizzard themselves have taken back the &quot;bring the player not the class&quot;, like publicly they said that was wrong.<br />
<br />
For the cutting edge and bosses like KJ it comes to a rather simple equation:<br />
<br />
you need dps classes that are top dps, have good mobility and great personal CDs and utility.<br />
<br />
You can then easily work out why in melee rogues are top, in distance you have hunters and moonkins (innervate).<br />
<br />
The boss will most likely be nerfed a lot in order for it to be doable by a non stacking raid comp that has the required gear and skill.</div></div><hr />

It's about 2 billion AP to reach concordance at 52. Getting the next 10 points to 62 is another ~29 billion AP on top of that, without any AK increase to come. It's intentionally so high that there's just no viable worth in hardcore farming this stuff especially with multiple specs and alts involved.</div></div><hr />

Oh hai This game is So hard. Everyone on US Illidan who is good and has been around a long time knows you're a bunch of try hard baddies who can't even analyze logs properly, have more wipes on farm than progression, and have constant people leaving because you have a basically leaderless guild of trolls that bitch and moan about anything they don't like. The only reason people even join your guild is to get into a better one.<br />
<br />
That's what happens when you have at least enough of a group to down content, but your guild leader is a thoroughly toxic troll that ninja loots, and you attempt to harass and flame people based on their limited experience logs when your raid logs are on the whole complete garbage (read you had hundreds of elisande wipes on farm). Also no one is impressed with your good late game logs when you overgear content ya jack wagons, so because of your shit attitudes and false belief that you're &quot;elite&quot; you will continue to shat on, people will leave your guild for better pastures, and you will not be able to recruit quality players, cuz they aren't interested in raiding with idiots who can't even log review to see the replay of your dumbass core raider with Call of Night literally running up to me, the other player with the debuff while some 18 yr old momma's boy rages on discord and doesn't know wtf is going on.<br />

You idiots were so worried about rankings in late game that you were wiping to BOT from your moronic core raiders pushing phases and double spawning solar flares. Yes a lot of OG Illidan players saw your logs after you kicked me, yes they declared you a toxic cesspool of nothingness because you are. <br />
<br />
No a person who does not make raid wiping errors on content he or she has less experience on than your core raiders is not worse than your core raiders who do.</div></div><hr />

I have 5 toons that are all 915-930ish I lvl, my main has concordance in all specs, and all of them have 56-58 points in their main spec, and working on a 6th toon that is currently 910 I lvl and nearly has concodance in 2 specs. And I'm casual, I don't even log in daily let alone raid more than extremely casually and not consistent at all on anything other than my main, they are very much not casual, they actually get paid to play and actually run multiple raids with different alts to gear them up. You don't know wtf you're talking about.<br />
<br />
this is far from being casual ... u are a hardcore player .. a casual player doesn not have 6 chars with the potential to clear heroic ToS<br />

Well the thing is that after 60 traits. I will take ages to get 1 trait. The peron atm with the most traits is at 65, and that is with almost 100m AP in the weapon. And that's with m+ farming day and night 24/7. So I would say that around 57-60 traits is kinda hardcore for a raiding guild that is pushing for WF.</div></div><hr />

And confirmed MOP baby. Limited attempts was sort of a thing in Ulduar with Algalon, it had a 1 hour timer to kill the boss at first (you could wipe as many times as you needed in the hour, however), and then in Trial of the Crusader there was a max of 50 attempts to clear the whole place every week, in ICC once all wings had opened there were 20 weekly attempts available to kill the final boss of each wing + Lich King, later they brought it back for Ra'Den in TOT which had 30 attempts available weekly.</div></div><hr />

That is why I said pretty sure. I thought I was sure but not fully.<br />

That's the type of attitude that i dislike from some players in the player base, entitled people that think things should be showered to them just because they exist.

ICC had them as well, but ya fair enough. I don't think it's a good mechanic either, and I think this argument that they should put such artificial blocks to &quot;give others a chance at world firsts&quot; is silly, they don't have any more a chance with less attempts than they do with more.</div></div><hr />

654 attempts. Isn't impressive. Just keep pulling and the numbers will all line up. Brute force it... no skill. Just having the time to sit there and do it over and over again is all this is. If each attempt averages 5 min. Its something like 2.5 days of pulling. I'm not impressed. I guess if I could quit my job and just play wow 24/7 I could be one of these celebrated &quot;best in the worlders&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well, it's still the game for you. There are things like LFR, LFD etc. that give you loot for simply being there. <br />
<br />
I'll let you do whatever you like to do (LFR, possibly even normal mode), so please let me (and others like me) do challenging content that you actually have to work hard to learn and then can finally beat. Also, the satisfaction I get when a boss that you have spent hundreds of attempts on, finally dies is just so incredible that I don't want to miss it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll add that the top guilds didn't respond to limited attempts by just pulling X number of times then sitting on their hands the rest of the week. They had alts test the waters first to see if limited attempts would be a problem for a given boss (when it wasn't just a bonus boss that was limited) and for the tougher bosses to get practice in before they spent attempts on their main raid. Basically, it just made having multiple raid ready characters even more important for the progression race than they are now, because every extra raid you could field was an extra X attempts at a boss to practice.<br />
<br />
And then once you were actually using the attempts, there was a lot of pressure to wait for every single cooldown to be available before pulling so you are at your best for every pull. This mostly meant reincarnate but there were a handful of other abilities that wouldn't be quite ready without waiting if used shortly before a wipe.<br />
<br />
That is basically why they abandoned the concept of limited attempts in the first place, all it did was frustrate people and didn't even really accomplish the intended goal. They tried it again for Ra-den but if I remember correctly he was so easy compared to Lei-shen that the limited attempts for him never really mattered.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that the best tank in the world just rigged his damn keyboard to spam sunder armor over and over and went afk during a raid boss. Mike Preach will tell you all about that. The only reason it took people so long to kill bosses in Vanilla was because the game was poorly designed.

Relatively speaking they certainly were. You cite people keyboard turning but at the time complaints about this was not even something you'd hear from pvpers really because that whole aspect of the game was an afterthought. There wasn't a lot of intense movement involved in pve that made the game constrictive if you didn't play with keybinds, so not a serious concern at the time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beckers</div><div class="date">2017-07-17, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's not spot on, first off he was ignoring points I was actually making and making ridiculous assumptions about what he thinks I think and overlooking everything I said even though I was just laying out facts about what the game was like and not giving my opinion at all.<br />
<br />
The main problem is that yourself, him and others on this forum seem to fail at reading comprehension and the English language. I never said that Vanilla raid bosses were harder or something like that, but you keep repeating about how bosses today are harder and then when someone brings up how the game was otherwise difficulty you foam at the mouth about how the game had no difficulty to at all because it required no skillz!<br />
<br />
And what that means is that you are quite pathetic to have some need to force your opinion about the game down other people's throats in this manner, and also that you do not comprehend basic English. I broke this down very simply to you people already. And it does not matter if you agree or not I am correct and what I am talking about is not open to debate, I am only talking facts here. I never gave my opinion about the game.<br />
<br />
The first think you need to get through your skull is that the simple word difficult does not mean &quot;requires skill&quot; the simple definition is something requiring effort or skill. Climbing fucking Mount Everest does not require you to be a skilled survivalist or climber by any means, anyone can join an expedition and do that these days, but it is something that requires a lot of fucking effort and isn't easy to do. <br />
<br />
You and that fool aren't even arguing about things that were even brought up here by other people, you're just straight up talking right out of your ass about things you clearly didn't even experience yourself. And not only that you are talking down to people that are more experienced than you with the current game as well as the past and that makes you look even more foolish. That fool didn't make it past Mythic Krosus in Nighthold, I was on Gul'dan before TOS launched. <br />
<br />
But somehow this less skilled and experienced player who fails to understand basic English does not only know more about the game he has less experience playing, he can read people's minds too? <br />
<br />
He's a bottom tier Mythic Raider arguing straight out of his ass. It's beyond stupid. Y'all young and inexperienced gamers who think you don't look incredibly foolish right now because this realm is full of Cata/MOP babies just like you that think they're playing a more difficult game on the whole than any of us ever played before.<br />
<br />
You're damn right I think the game on the whole is easier now, because it fucking is. In previous iterations of this game it was never even possible to outgear the content you were trying to clear while it was still the cutting edge content of the game. That's the norm now. In previous interations of the game you couldn't bring whatever class comp you wanted. I'm not sitting here presenting my opinion as a player that hasn't even played this entire game since day 1 as a fact though, and the thing is the complexity of the boss mechanics isn't the only thing in this game, there's more to this game than just those bosses and you can't just put them in a bubble outside of the rest of the game and measure which is harder than the other without the context of the rest of the game, it doesn't work that way.<br />
<br />
If you would have been a tiny bit less condescending, people might follow through with you, but after a few lines I figured it's a lost cause so..<br />

Well who knows what mythic only phase that fight has, but that comp makes a lot of sense actually. Would allow them to solo soak most dreadflames/armageddons and such.<br />

Dude this was after a lot of back and forth with a guy that has only ever killed the easiest mythic bosses when they were new talking to me like I'm just some LFR player.

IDK if they were serious when they said impossible or exaggerating, though when they put in that many attempts one can definitely argue it was all just a matter of keep trying until the rng swings into your favor to allow you to beat the fight.</div></div><hr />

The only way to balance at that bleeding edge level would be to delete all differences and just have one class. No matter what, some classes will have some slight advantage on some bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no such thing as slight advantage when it comes to WF race. Everything is optimised, if class A is slightly better than class B, it makes total sense to stack class A. People are wiping for 600 times, obv, they'll need every bit of advantage to kill the boss. There's no way to avoid this situation.<br />
<br />
It doesn't apply to the rest of the player base though.<br />

Everyone on US Illidan who is good and has been around a long time knows you're a bunch of try hard baddies who can't even analyze logs properly, have more wipes on farm than progression, and have constant people leaving because you have a basically leaderless guild of trolls that bitch and moan about anything they don't like. The only reason people even join your guild is to get into a better one.<br />
<br />
That's what happens when you have at least enough of a group to down content, but your guild leader is a thoroughly toxic troll that ninja loots, and you attempt to harass and flame people based on their limited experience logs when your raid logs are on the whole complete garbage (read you had hundreds of elisande wipes on farm). Also no one is impressed with your good late game logs when you overgear content ya jack wagons, so because of your shit attitudes and false belief that you're &quot;elite&quot; you will continue to shat on, people will leave your guild for better pastures, and you will not be able to recruit quality players, cuz they aren't interested in raiding with idiots who can't even log review to see the replay of your dumbass core raider with Call of Night literally running up to me, the other player with the debuff while some 18 yr old momma's boy rages on discord and doesn't know wtf is going on.<br />
<br />
You idiots were so worried about rankings in late game that you were wiping to BOT from your moronic core raiders pushing phases and double spawning solar flares. Yes a lot of OG Illidan players saw your logs after you kicked me, yes they declared you a toxic cesspool of nothingness because you are. <br />
<br />
No a person who does not make raid wiping errors on content he or she has less experience on than your core raiders is not worse than your core raiders who do.<br />
<br />
The only thing toxic here is how crap you are. Stop abusing that word, you buzz harpie nobody. Go be garbage in another game. Also, stop pretending you talk to any of the better players on Illidan, for heck's sake. We all talk among ourselves in other Discords and tease each other and share boss tips. The only people that bring you up is TGiSH because of how cringey you are as a meme. We've got an entire imgur album dedicated to both how much you suck and how gross it is to talk to you as a person.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Impossible to get into HC PUGs? That's not even funny. One of my alts is retardin, she's doing fine. HC isn't the bleeding edge of raiding, you can go there w/ any class/spec. But I'd agree w/ one thing, in some cases getting into PUGs might be an issue due to community stigma, but, mate, even now, after exhibiting awesome performance in NH, BM monks have issues w/ PUGs due to 2 expansions old belief that monks are a shite class, it gets even worse if monk is panda :p<br />
<br />
As for Mythic raiding, despite not being present in WF race, retardins are raiding in M ToS, there's guys w/ 7/9M, I bet there's even retardins who are progressing towards their first Avatar kill. People will get more gear. KJ will be nerfed soon, WF guilds provided Blizz w/ enough data to adjust encounters, that's how things go all the time. Mate, TBQH, everyone is present in Mythic right now, there's even junk tier FDKs who're at 7/9M.<br />
<br />
If you're raiding at such high level, you defo have more than one char that's Mythic ready, pick the best performing one for your first kills, others can go through ToS when it's on farm.<br />
<br />
You might have issues w/ your HC/M progression if you raid w/ tryhards though. But tryhards are cancer and should be avoided at all costs. FFS, I've seen tryhards who run splits in N and require to maintain at least 1-2 alts for HC progression. They blindly copy everything top guilds do.<br />

<br />
But it is also a fact that it took 4 months from the time MC opened until Rag was killed and this wasn't mostly do to people not know how to play their class. <br />
<br />
Nobody here is trying to say that these bosses were super complicated or anything like that, but this idea that the game on the whole is more difficult now (than it ever has been) is just wrong, completely beside the fact that the game was never really that hardcore to begin with.<br />
<br />
So it's a little peculiar that some of you feel the need to aggressively throw that out there. I mean literally nobody said anything like vanilla raid bosses being very complex in this discussion or anything like it. Just some guy came in here talking about how people are always saying how Vanilla was so much harder and literally all that guy was saying was the same exact kind of embellishment he was accusing others of, except talking about the current game. This from a guy that's not made it past mythic Krosus.</div></div><hr />
