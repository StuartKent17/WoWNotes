Welcome to the first in an ongoing series of programming- and engineering-focused articles that, over time, will cover some of the technical nuts and bolts that go into creating and running World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Before we kick this first one off, a quick warning: What follows is a fairly technical explanation for a graphical-setting change related to anti-aliasing. Most of you probably won’t notice any difference at all—this is primarily for those who tend to tinker with their hardware and graphical settings.<br />
<br />
In short, we’re taking strides to improve the performance of World of Warcraft, while also ensuring there’s plenty of potential to further increase graphical fidelity and enhance our support of high-end CPUs and graphics hardware.<br />
<br />
For Warlords of Draenor, we made a decision to remove Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) and instead include a new anti-aliasing technology called Conservative Morphological Anti-Aliasing (CMAA). This change is going to allow us to bring some overdue technological advancements to World of Warcraft over the course of the next few years—we’re thinking long-term with this change.<br />
<br />
One reason MSAA remained viable for WoW over the past decade was that the GPU had the time and resources to handle it. WoW has been a CPU-bound game for much of its lifetime, but during the Warlords development cycle, we endeavored to change that. A lot of that work involved analyzing the flow of data through our code and making sure we work on only what we need to for any given frame. One example is we now variably reduce the number of bones that need to be animated based on proximity and view (sometimes called level of detail, or LOD), a primary consumer of CPU time. We’ve also added a job system that the engine uses to task out animation and scene management in ways we had prototyped in Patch 5.4, but are expanding in Warlords.<br />
<br />
The outcome of all of this is that more than ever before, World of Warcraft relies heavily on a GPU that previously was largely free to handle things like MSAA. We explored a number of options to reconcile this increased GPU demand with the game’s anti-aliasing needs, and ultimately decided to embrace CMAA as our anti-aliasing technology for Warlords of Draenor. As with anything that can potentially change the look of the game, we vetted removing MSAA through our engineering and art teams before coming to the conclusion to swap it for CMAA. CMAA provides solid anti-aliasing at a fraction of the cost in memory and performance. It also integrates well with technologies we have planned for the future, and helps us bring those to the game sooner. We also support FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing), an even lighter-weight solution, as an option for our players using DirectX 9.<br />
<br />
CMAA fulfills our goals of providing high-quality anti-aliasing at reduced performance cost, while giving us the extra headroom we need to further improve the graphical fidelity of the game. We don’t have to make any architectural concessions within the engine for CMAA to work, and for Warlords of Draenor we’ve already been able to implement new graphical features like target outlining, soft particles, a new shadowing technique, and refraction—and more graphical features are on the horizon for future patches and expansions.<br />
<br />
For the launch of Warlords of Draenor, CMAA is the top-tier graphical setting available, but after release we’ll be exploring more options for players with high-performance graphics cards—and if they provide quality while still fitting into our future technology plans, we’ll take a serious look at adding them to the game.<br />
<br />
The graphical future of World of Warcraft is a bright one, and the changes we’ve made during the development of Warlords of Draenor have laid the groundwork for us to continue making the game look better and better far into the future.<br />
<br />

<br />
The graphics are so old and bad, no matter how they change it but Anti-Aliasing barely does anything at all at any setting, at least i dont see any difference, up close there is a tiny difference on hair and stuff but otherwise its non-existent. <br />
<br />
Not to mention if you dont play at max camera distance you are playing the game wrong and at that distance there is no chance you even care about anti-aliasing on your character.<br />
<br />
Sure a few corners and edges will look better, woohoo for raiding improvement.</div></div><hr />

(For me on a 27&quot; 1080p Monitor on Warlords Beta it is equal to having Anti-Aliasing Disabled!)<br />
<br />
Really hope we get a way to enable SuperSampling, which those of us that use it on Live have also just lost!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bisso</div><div class="date">2014-09-17, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I guess it explains the WHY they removed the MSAA. I tested it on the PTR, and it's true that the CMAA is just slightly blurring the whole screen, and most of the jagged edges are still very apparent. I'm not sure that Blizz art team was very pleased with the final decision, as it blurs their textures as well as the edges of polygons, unlike the MSAA that seemed to only work around the edges. If it allows us to be at 60fps in Tarren Mill vs. Southshore though, well I guess it's a good trade.</div></div><hr />

Discounting the first part of your statement which is obviously not true 100% of the time: the more zoomed out you are (the smaller your character on screen), the greater the proportion of pixels that are on an edge, making AA a greater benefit.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think it is about time Blizzard think about changing the core game engine, to achieve better graphics, rather than switching AA tech.<br />
It will never be worth rewriting from scratch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Camera distance doesn't affect Aliasing, yes small details will matter way less at max distance, but the aliasing will remain as ugly overall. That's why I don,t like games on console, which don't have the power to put some AA to remove the jagging. The Aliasing on a Mountain is as ugly as for a strand of hair.</div></div><hr />

I thought the graphics on the PTR looked quite nice, and of course since I didn't copy my massive collection of addons over the game ran much faster than I'm used to. (Pity I can't raid with the default UI.)</div></div><hr />

You'll never be able to achieve a stable 60 FPS during raids (at least during the actual fights, anyway) no matter what hardware you have. Wouldn't worry too much about it.</div></div><hr />

You guys all noticed that you now check a box and have radically different graphics settings inside a BG or instance, right? I thought that was also extremely cool of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MSAA is gone for good, you might have noticed MSAA is not offered on many modern game engines, specifically those that use Deferred Rendering. It's simply incompatible with Deferred Rendering. (Which the new engine is using now, providing us with substantial visual quality improvements in Draenor)<br />
However most modern games offer far better AA methods than FXAA (Used primarily on Consoles) and CMAA (Ineffective on most Jaggies especially when there is a high contrast differential)<br />
<br />
SSAA is the best AA method and is still compatible with the new WoW Engine. It's a high performance hit however (Half the FPS usually), I'm sure we'll be seeing this added in the future, and until then the method to use SSAA in Diablo 3 should work perfectly with the new WoW Engine.<br />
<br />
MLAA and SRAA are the two modern methods that they should have added, as they are comparable to MSAA in terms of performance hit/quality.</div></div><hr />

The people come and tell you the things they have done with the game how they have made it viable for high end computers to provide that beauty in detail that people want to see in a world to get lost into and all you can say is but the game will run on a low end machine. <br />
<br />
So what, what is your problem with low end machine being able to play the game on the cost of less visual effects?<br />
I live in a poor country and 2 months ago i spent what is ~80% of a monthly salary to ugprade several components of my PC to something that is not even near the top end and that's money i've saved in the course of few months. And invested in a better CPU while leaving the old GPU GTX650 and hoping to change that in a year. So i am happy that i will be able to play with good enough quality regardles that the cry babies born with silver spoon moan over the fact that ppl like me or worse even can play the game.</div></div><hr />

Just because they spend time to &quot;convince&quot; me that they have created something very beautiful doesn't mean that I have not played other games and especially other MMOs to compare with...what they said is that they are very talented because they managed to make something acceptable at 2014 in their old and crap graphic engine.

<br />
The $300 walmart special could run WoW better than what most people complaining have. I know bc I ran it on one just fine for about 2 years, and my kids now use the same PC, with nothing more than a cheapo Radeon card swapped in. You don't have to spend a fortune on a computer to run WoW. What many ppl make the mistake of is insisting on gaming on a laptop which is horribly restricted on receiving updated hardware. <br />
<br />
You can build yourself a very nice desktop to game on for under $1000. And doing so let's you update it over time. Sure I like my fancy gaming machine, but it's overkill on what I need to play any blizzard game at max settings. It's unnecessary to be able to run several instances of the game at max settings. I could've spent half what I paid and still been perfectly fine for WoW.</div></div><hr />

The inevitable misconception of PC gaming.<br />
<br />
WoW already has relaxed settings which span a fairly wide array of systems. Those who fall below the minimum specifications shouldn't blame Blizzard for not catering to machines which likely came with Windows XP pre-installed. Blizzard always tweaks the graphics with each expansion and there was a lot of time between Mists and Warlords to upgrade if your system was on the minimum end of Mists. Folks probably spent more on the subscription in Mists than it would take to upgrade components to be ready for Warlords.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't take a tech-related post less than two months from release to make people realize that their toasters will not cut it.</div></div><hr />

As the post says, I think they changed to CMAA just to have more GPU time to spend in other things like the GPU bone animation optimization it mentions, that in fact seems more interesting for me than the anti-aliasing change. Here is the first time I hear WoW have moved to Deferred Rendering, interesting, it means more chances to see future cool effects and improvements. In response to some of the replies:<br />
<br />
With a 27''@1080p you will see jagged borders and pixels everywhere, with or without anti-aliasing. 24@1080p or 27@1440p are the good choices in my opinion.<br />
<br />
About my field, the programming languages: <br />
<br />
- For sure the client is implemented with at least C++ and Lua, but never heard about Python, maybe or maybe not. XML and a custom binary format for the cooked assets (remember Storm.dll :P?). And just to be clear, VC++ is not a language, is a compiler (well, that's what some people say... ;).<br />
- For the dedicated server (where the world is running) probably they use C++ too, sounds crazy to replicate functionality and entities they implemented in C++ in another language. Not sure if they used Lua in the server side too, but makes sense. For sure they use bash, perl, ruby, etc... bot more probably for internal tools.<br />
- No idea about the DB, but I think that the queries/inserts/updates done by the dedicated server while you are playing are done in a DB that is entirely loaded in the server RAM, and copied to a HD every N seconds, think in any DB that supports this feature, maybe the changed the DB more than once since WoW started to run.<br />
- No idea about the Backend (web and other services) maybe Java as Xjev mentioned, or php, or ruby..., maybe some services are in node.js, at least I can imagine someone at Blizzard is proposing this ^_^.</div></div><hr />

Ehr.. I don't think they use MSAA or CMAA when rendering the user interface... just the scene (characters, buildings, etc..), then the user interface is rendered on top of that without any post-process.<br />
<br />
The pipeline probably is:<br />
<br />
&gt; Bind the framebuffer where the scene will be rendered<br />
&gt; Render the scene <br />
&gt; Bind another framebuffer or the default one and render the previous rendered scene with the post process (apply CMAA)<br />
&gt; Render the User interface.</div></div><hr />

Erm.. that image doesn't show MSAA, it shows SMAA which is a modified version of MLAA which is deferred renderer compatible. MSAA isn't really deferred renderer compatible. MSAA 1x is the equivalent to no AA at all, which is what I run WoW with at the moment. SMAA 1x is actually a very good AA technique.<br />
<br />
Also, as they said in the blog, they are improving the rendering engine and there could possibly be other AA implementations added over time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet another move towards getting the game ready for retirement.<br />
<br />
I don't think implementing a completely new rendering engine that is similar to that utilised in the Frostbite and CryEngine 3 game engines powering Battlefield 4 and Crysis 3, can be considered &quot;moving the game towards retirement&quot;. It's a massive upgrade to WoW's game engine in reality.</div></div><hr />

You might actually see some extra benefit with multi-GPU setups. Part of what Blizzard said in a much more simplified manner, was that WoW will rely much more heavily on shader programs than it used to, shader programs can only be run on the GPU and that is more or less what they're offloading a fair amount of the CPU load onto, making dedicated shader programs to run more efficiently on the GPU, the more shader units your GPU's have, the better performance you will get when the shader programs are executed, therefore multiple GPU's should mean more shader units to process more shader effects.<br />
<br />
Also, being a deferred rendering system similar to modern game like Battlefield 4 etc. Nvidia and AMD are far more likely to release new drivers that will actually have a beneficial effect on WoW's performance, there hasn't really been a GPU driver update with an advertised improvement in WoW's performance for a long time.</div></div><hr />

The difference in those images is an effect of lighting changes. Antialiasing deals with object edges, or &quot;jaggies&quot; on the polygon models. It is not what is making things &quot;blurry&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I have a theory about that and is that the number of shader cores isn't as important as the GPU generation. I mean, a newer graphic card, even if has less power and shader cores can be better by the fact that usually comes with a newer feature, maybe a new extension for OpenGL/DirectX or directly a new version of those graphics APIs, anyway, things not available in the past generation, and this features open the door to improvements and optimizations that can't be done in previous graphics cards, and I think this is what blizzard is doing, is moving to a newer generation features (4 year old or so), closing the hairpin for older graphic cards. Thing for example in MRT, Deferred Lighting is really expensive if you run it in a card without MRT (Multi Render Target), even if you are using half-floats in a 32 bit texture, but with a card with MRT, even if this card has less shader cores, less memory or less clock speed automatically means a big optimization for this feature, making possible to store the data on a single pass and more chance to get 60fps, that's the sort of things I mean Blizzard is taking in consideration.<br />

<br />
Looking forward to that, because I totally disagree with:<br />
<br />
CMAA provides solid anti-aliasing and <br />
CMAA fulfills our goals of providing high-quality anti-aliasing<br />
<br />
<br />
Surely it looks good/equal for the big stuff in WoD, but not for the smallest of details or smaller objects in the distance like currently in MoP.</div></div><hr />

Antialiasing deals with object edges, or &quot;jaggies&quot; on the polygon models. It is not what is making things &quot;blurry&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, my experience with FXAA enabled on the Beta produces the same result as shown in that image in every zone. CMAA does not produce that affect. It is not Bloom or any other lighting effect, as if it was the same result would occur with CMAA.<br />
<br />
FXAA is essentially nothing more than a Full Screen Blur Effect.</div></div><hr />

I mean, a newer graphic card, even if has less power and shader cores can be better by the fact that usually comes with a newer feature, maybe a new extension for OpenGL/DirectX or directly a new version of those graphics APIs, anyway, things not available in the past generation, and this features open the door to improvements and optimizations that can't be done in previous graphics cards, and I think this is what blizzard is doing, is moving to a newer generation features (4 year old or so), closing the hairpin for older graphic cards. Thing for example in MRT, Deferred Lighting is really expensive if you run it in a card without MRT (Multi Render Target), even if you are using half-floats in a 32 bit texture, but with a card with MRT, even if this card has less shader cores, less memory or less clock speed automatically means a big optimization for this feature, making possible to store the data on a single pass and more chance to get 60fps, that's the sort of things I mean Blizzard is taking in consideration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats true, I might have been a bit mis-representative about more shader units meaning better performance and being the only thing that counts, shader unit count does of course count and make a difference, the more shader programs you can run at once in parallel, the better performance will be, like multi-threading on a much larger scale.<br />
<br />
In the same way though, newer GPU's with newer architectures will usually be better than older ones, a lot of newer GPU's do tend to have more units per GPU though so thats was part of the point I was getting at. Dual 780Ti's in SLI should be better and see some benefit compared to a single one, but one 780ti is probably better than two 580GTX's potentially. My point mainly was you should see much more benefit from two cards than a single card of the same type with the deferred system.<br />
<br />
MRT is really well supported in the DirectX 11 pipeline by itself and most modern GPU's (within the last 4 years or so) support it so you're pretty well covered there. Obviously newer more powerful GPU's provide improved architectures designed specifically to the latest graphics API's. I am pretty excited about the deferred rendering as it should really give WoW a big improvement especially as Blizzard add more features to it and should last it a good long time.</div></div><hr />

So there is no way that toaster of yours with bad resolution will see a difference. You are just being dramatic for no reason.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you are at the sweetspot then in terms of Pixel Density. People with 20&quot; monitors at 1080p are saying the same thing.<br />
<br />
For someone that's &quot;calling bs&quot;, you made alot of assumptions in that post. Including that I play on a &quot;toaster&quot;. I have the 760GTX (Not even remotely close to being a toaster), the only difference is you have a substantially higher resolution monitor, which if anything excludes you from having a objective perspective on this as you are not affected by it. Higher Pixel Density = Less Viable Aliasing. (Me with my &quot;bad resolution&quot; of 1080p on a 27&quot; screen clearly see's aliasing with CMAA, just like the majority with 1080p screens at higher than 21&quot; dimensions)<br />
<br />
Do you also &quot;call bs&quot; on my claim that FXAA is extremely blurry?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just want to point out to the two of you, and anyone else talking about SLI performance optimization, that there's not really much, if anything, to do in that regard. When you make a call to a graphics API (DirectX in WoW's case), you are asking for something very specific. So specific, in fact, that GPUs are able to almost perfectly parallelize any rasterization you ask it to perform. The only reason you don't see exactly double the performance, when running SLI or Xfire, is because one GPU will be responsible for ensuring that frames are delivered to the CPU in the proper order (this relationship is effectively the master-slave model). This means that it will always seem like one GPU is doing more work than the other, and it is, but the reality of the situation is that as much work as possible is being offloaded to the secondary GPU. <br />
<br />
Hopefully this shines some light on the SLI situation. There always seems to be a lot of confusion around this issue.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">voskopoula</div><div class="date">2014-09-17, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most important part of this post is <br />
The outcome of all of this is that more than ever before, World of Warcraft relies heavily on a GPU that previously was largely free to handle things like MSAA. We explored a number of options to reconcile this increased GPU demand with the game’s anti-aliasing needs, and ultimately decided to embrace CMAA as our anti-aliasing technology for Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
So to translate they are changing the antialiasing method, because they are sending more weight from CPU to GPU overall. So in order to not have customers getting bottlenecked from average GPUs even if they have awesome CPUs they did change the antialiasing method to a lighterweight method.<br />
<br />
Seems it is all about balancing while adding new graphical features and i bet the new character models did have an impact. Thats why they <br />
One example is we now variably reduce the number of bones that need to be animated based on proximity and view (sometimes called level of detail, or LOD), a primary consumer of CPU time.<br />
Translation, with the new character models average cpus are bottlenecking and we must cut down LoD on bones too!<br />
<br />
Thoughts<br />
1) If you have an awesome cpu with an awesome gpu on a 3 monitor setup, it will pay up visualy if you can tinker those lod limitations (unless they are automated and open up depending your hardware)<br />
2) If you had a balanced average PC on MoP things might drop a little on fps but i don't think they will drop inside raid encounters. Now the word balanced is pretty vague. This is a huge subject and we really can't know what balanced setup we need unless we spawn on the center of the major city hub of a faction in WoD the first weeks :P. However i would expect some really low fps for average PCs (CPU+GPU on 120-180$/euro each) if you spawn on the center of the major city hub during the first level up weeks :P. Considering all players will be showing heads and not helmets..:P<br />
3) Bottlenecking could be more easy to happen, especially on average game PC, no matter what balancing they will do, the graphical data will be bigger right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've played games for damn near 32 years.....I'm one of those geeks that built his own machines (for about 15 years straight) .....I did the over clocking, not just of CPU's but memory and GPU's...AND I'm not talking with the current easy mode Bios systems and mobos I'm talking the old school over clocking flicking dip switches, &quot;forcing&quot; timing settings on memory.......and breaking shit some times costing me lots of money....:)<br />
<br />
I no longer do that stuff....and my current desktop was pre-made , bought from one of the popular gaming PC companies....<br />
<br />
But anyway I'm a geek and I honestly don't see a big difference even in the video posted above. I have a system that can handle Metro Last Light on high and get 60 fps (except some spots in the story when the screen gets really busy it dips down into the 40's).....I run Battlefield 4 on max settings and get about 60-70 fps, again unless the battle is really intense then i do sometimes lag down into low 40's.<br />
<br />
With my rig in beta everything looks beautiful to me...on Ultra and DX11....the game looks great (for WoW I mean).....I think like almost any type of change blizz makes with WoW it'll be over dramatized and people will exaggerate the hell out of it, making it way more an issue that it has any real right to be.<br />
<br />
Btw why is the color/shadowing different in the video with CMAA versus all the others? LOL....CMAA, according to all I've read on it, like any other AA tech doesn't &quot;do&quot; anything with colors.</div></div><hr />

I know MSAA cannot be forced anymore in beta or PTR due to the engine being changed to deferred engine or something like that.<br />
It is possible to force it on some cards, but it results in severe graphical infidelities. It is easier to just downsample, if you have a decent monitor and a decent graphics card, I can point you in the right direction for downsampling. Be aware, it can make the text ingame look a bit blurry due to the way the method works, but the results are much better than the new options on PTR/Beta.<br />

I don't think it caused such a big backlash. I was one of the people advocating for answers on the subject, and I am very upset about the change, but I am glad they had the guts to answer us without dodging questions or answers. They did a good job.</div></div><hr />

Well, for one, they are out of time, I am 100% sure they have finished in house builds at this point. I fully expect, especially after all that has been said, that we will be seeing SSAA ingame by the launch of 7.0, if not 7.0 itself, like I said above though, if you can handle the blur on the text, Downsampling is the superior option for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Well, my monitor is only 1080p, don't think it can go higher. Plus I play at 1600x1200, so CMAA looks like ass at this resolution. I would go up to 1080, but then I lose widescreen on some parts, I can't stand black bars on my monitor.</div></div><hr />

This article doesn't mention a switch to a deferred renderer at all, just says &quot;msaa got to expensive, so we removed it and integrated a cheaper crappy looking version for console peasants&quot;, or am i missing something here?<br />
I really get the feeling here they are preparing the engine for a console version of WoW... :(<br />
But then again they would need to improve on the multithreading of the engine (with the slow ass APUs in consoles).<br />

<br />
There used to be a setting to turn off glow, then they got rid of that and you had to do a console command. now that's also gone. The default setting (see below) is for me completely unbearable, and now there is no way to get rid of it without getting rid of AA as well. <br />

If you are going to judge a community on the negative responses then you will never get an accurate view.<br />
Look at how many people make threads bashing LFR, and then look at the poll results in each of those threads, which are overwhemingly positive in their support for the feature.<br />
Players who want to whine are more readily going to vocalise their opinions and to insist on sharing them with as many as possible.<br />
Those happy about something rarely feel the need to inform others of that.<br />
<br />
If this is to support old hardware then obviously blizzard feel that is worth doing, most likely due to numbers of players they would lose if they did not.<br />
<br />
Sure, it can be disappointing that your hardware isn't utilised or supported properly.<br />
I get that, but there isn't the need for the hostility that has been demonstrated here.<br />
Namecalling won't achieve the result you want.<br />
Real constructive discussion could, but I am seeing little of that.</div></div><hr />

Never understood why people care about above 60fps in a MMO like WoW not like the game has anything that blurs when you move. Can't really tell the difference and if you can then you are concentrating to much on the wrong thing! Try gaming your abilities or paying attention to the fight. 30fps is plenty in a game like WoW.</div></div><hr />

No actually, it is more than likely because of all the engine work they did Nvidia hasn't updated the drivers for your card to support the changes yet, once that gets through you should be able to use it again, I say should. Its also really important to note: Inspector and Control Panel do not always work, for instance, in Skyrim I cannot force anything via Control Panel or Inspector, in WoW (on Live) I can force 1 type of non-native AA, on Beta I can force 1 as well, but its fucked 6 ways to Sunday. It all depends on if the Moon is Aligned properly and the gods are on your side...... shit kinda sucks sometimes :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You can add custom resolutions that go higher via things like Nvidia Control Panel. Go read through the link I posted, he goes in depth to explain exactly what to do, it is pretty crazy. I can play WoW at 4k downsampled (3840x2400), and I do not notice any FPS hits at all, plus the Anti-Aliasing is no longer needed due to the Downsampling.</div></div><hr />

Yes. People who use the term &quot;1080p&quot; while referencing their computer monitors are noobs. 1920 x 1080 is a terrible PC resolution. 1920 x 1200 is the closest comparable resolution. A monitor with a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 is a poor quality screen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's pretty true. A 1920x1080 screen is of lesser quality than 1920x1200. I can see it instantly, and it drives me insane. It's not a computing resolution.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in the past 5-6 years or so, monitor manufacturers have been clinging to the &quot;1080p&quot; term as a reason to produce shitty monitors, because 90% of consumers think that 1080p is the best.<br />
<br />
Granted it's not as noticeable on 22&quot; or smaller monitors, but on a 24, 27, or 30&quot; monitor it's absolutely awful.</div></div><hr />

You should set your monitor at whatever the native resolution is. 1920 x 1200 is better than 1080p. 1920 x 1200 could also be called 1200p (higher is better).<br />
<br />
1920 x 1200 should also be set at 16:10.</div></div><hr />

I can say for sure, I never dip below 50 in very crowded areas on beta, the lowest I was dipping was Pre-Optimization Tanaan Intro and that was 45, they really did a good job with the optimization, despite the terrible AA changes.</div></div><hr />

A monitor with a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 is a poor quality screen.<br />
<br />
Most 3D games scale horizontal+, not vertical-. 1920x1080 is 16:9 which is a wider aspect ratio than 1920x1200 which is 16:10. Horizontal+ means 3D games will display the same vertical information in your game regardless of resolution, but add to the sides the wider your aspect ratio is. That means 1920x1200 has less of the game on the screen, because the sides are cut off compared to 1920x1080. The extra 120 vertical pixels are useful in the Windows UI and games that do not have aspect ratio scaling, but those games are far rarer. For most games that scale with aspect ratio, wider is better. 16:9 &gt; 16:10 &gt; 4:3 &gt; 5:4<br />
<br />
As for the panel quality, there are plenty of IPS 1920x1080 monitors.<br />
<br />
Not that I particularly care, as my monitor is 2560x1440 (16:9 so woot), but your information is out of date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...What? I don't know what the hell you're talking about. &quot;1080p&quot; is a term used to market TVs, it means 1920x1080 - ie an aspect ratio of 16:9. Thanks to the success of big screen TVs this has become a de facto standard, so a lot of monitors are made in this ratio now rather than 16:10 (1920x1200), which was briefly popular several years ago. I'd say most monitors these days are 16:9 rather than 16:10.<br />
<br />
One is not &quot;better&quot; than the other, it's simply two different &quot;widescreen&quot; standards. 16:10 is slightly taller. I mean okay, you might personally prefer one over the other but that's just opinion.<br />
<br />
And regardless of which you have you should always run your monitor in its native resolution because modern PC monitors look shitty in non-native resolutions because they have to approximate them, unlike the old CRTs that were capable of the full range of resolutions without loss.<br />

You should set your monitor at whatever the native resolution is. 1920 x 1200 is better than 1080p. 1920 x 1200 could also be called 1200p (higher is better).<br />
<br />
1920 x 1200 should also be set at 16:10.<br />
<br />
It's only &quot;better&quot; to set your monitor to 1920x1600 (16:10) if that's your monitor's native resolution, which I think is unlikely unless you went out of your way to buy one, or it's quite old.<br />

My monitor says the recommended resolution for it is 1920 x 1080. It does not go any higher. Can I still use downsampling on this monitor or it won't work 'cause I checked the link for downsampling and it requires resolution to be much higher than that I think.<br />
<br />
How do I know if my monitor is 1080p? Where can I find that out?<br />
<br />
If it says the recommended resolution is 1920x1080, that means it's 1080p.<br />

The downside is that it could be at the cost of a greater proportion of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Yeah I'm sure millions will quit WoW because of MSAA.<br />
<br />
Obviously WoW is a game you play because you're a massive graphics snob.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't call it a loss to lose a player who plays for the graphics.<br />
WoW has always had a cartoony look about it, and I think it would be best to keep it that way.</div></div><hr />

it's not an issue as long as we can force a different AA method through our graphics card control panel... some games that specify AA methods don't let you do that. e.g. any game that uses FXAA will not let you force, MSAA or SSAA for example. I run with 8x SSAA because it actually AA's foliage and text.</div></div><hr />

Most kids building PCs have no real idea about the relative performance of the parts they're using. Their mentality is usually along the lines of &quot;if your [pc part] wasn't the most expensive thing on the market then your FPS is going to suck lol&quot; regardless of the actual performance demands of the game.<br />

On topic: CMAA is in no way a suitable replacement for MSAA. I'm starting to suspect that Blizz are using the WoW subs to fund development of an MMO game engine that is more suitable for consoles. I'm not saying that they're trying to make WoW for consoles but it's got to make some financial sense to evolve their existing tried and tested engine over time rather than build an entirely new engine from scratch for whatever future MMO they're planning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why, whatever can you mean? You pick CMAA when you want to minimize your power use and deal with texture blurring in certain situations. You know, like playing a game with eleventeen moving elements on a giant TV screen. ;)<br />
<br />
The game doesn't have a lot of alpha textures, does it? Nah, we'll be fine.<br />
<br />
FXAA can be God-awful depending on the game developer (it uses developer implemented shaders); remember, that 'X' stands for &quot;approximate&quot;! Mostly I think it looks like that Barbra Walters filter if you're sitting, oh, normal distance from a monitor or laptop screen, but becomes passable across a room. Hmmm....<br />
<br />
Of course they're moving towards a console engine, I completely agree. It's the Disney Parks problem all over again, &quot;There's some market we haven't taken money from yet no matter how tenuously related!&quot;<br />
<br />
Notice we're moving towards having each class have exactly [NUMBER_OF_BUTTONS_ON_A_PS4_CONTROLLER] powers you'd use most often. Pair that with our big, big step down in rendering from MSAA which, whoops, just by coincidence the new consoles have problems using...<br />
<br />
Hey, there's got to be somebody left on XBOX Live with money, right?</div></div><hr />

Hi noob question,, but could this be a reason behind the game crashes that have been occuring since expansion 5.x. I got a Nvidia GT540M and after trying just about everything (setting changes/driver updates/addon removal/defrag/reinstall/repair) to end crashes in MoP, and its never worked. I am convinced that heres some WoW code compatibility issues with this card.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kojinshugi</div><div class="date">2014-09-19, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it's pretty true. A 1920x1080 screen is of lesser quality than 1920x1200. I can see it instantly, and it drives me insane. It's not a computing resolution.<br />
<br />
This is absolute gobbledegook. There is no such thing as &quot;computing resolution&quot;. 1920x1080 is generally the exact same ppi as a comparable 1920x1200 monitor, except it's slightly narrower.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in the past 5-6 years or so, monitor manufacturers have been clinging to the &quot;1080p&quot; term as a reason to produce shitty monitors, because 90% of consumers think that 1080p is the best.<br />
<br />
No, they've been making 1080p monitors because most visual content is produced at a 16:9 aspect ratio.<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted it's not as noticeable on 22&quot; or smaller monitors, but on a 24, 27, or 30&quot; monitor it's absolutely awful.<br />
<br />
Again, you're talking absolute nonsense. The resolution of a panel has absolutely NOTHING to do with its quality, except that cheap 16:10 monitors generally aren't made anymore, so a lot of people have lower quality 1920x1080 monitors they bought for $150. A high quality 16:9 monitor has absolutely no visual difference compared to a high quality 16:10 monitor, except it has 120 fewer vertical pixels.</div></div><hr />

It would be nice if the game benefited from multi gpu's more! And no, dont blame nvidia or amd.<br />
I know...first world problems =/<br /> 
<br />
I have been thinking about picking up a 4K monitor and running at 4K. How good does the game look compared to 1080p, do you see a noticeable difference? I mainly want to be able to pan my camera out even further and also just have an even prettier game. WoD, and even MoP, look better than older content. WoD I think especially looks like the game got a visual bump wandering the zones and I want to see this.<br />
<br />
Do you run SLI to achieve 4K or are you using a single card. I currently run a 770 superclock and may trade it in for a 970, 2x 970s or a single 980.<br />
<br />
What are peoples thoughts on this? Will SLI be working better with WoD and the game changes?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HeWhoWalksWithGreenFlames</div><div class="date">2014-10-13, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2x MSAA is good, 4x MSAA is great, and 8x MSAA is superlative when it comes to removing aliasing artifacts from the edges of polygons. You can add coverage samples and edge-detect algorithms to 4x MSAA and it still doesn’t rival true 8x MSAA. <br />
<br />
Morphological AA also works in conjunction with MSAA. MLAA can be a great option, but it can have a detrimental effect on image quality when small text is critical in game play. As such, it isn’t viable as a set-and-forget method of anti-aliasing for everyone.<br />
<br />
I've not seen any issues with MLAA in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone not liking the changes,<br />
<br />
If you aren't happy with the changes, do what I do, disable AA in-game, override it in your NCP or AMD Catalyst, and enable you own AA. I use AMD. I've override it on my Catalyst Control Center. I sometimes change it to 8xEQAA or 16x with MLAA enabled. When I am in Shrine of Two Moons, I get anywhere between 100 to 200 FPS. In &quot;Garry&quot; or Garrosh 10/25 man, I get around 30 FPS with maximum settings, but Multisample is set to 0x. Give it a try if you aren't happy with CMAA.<br />
<br />
Second Thing. CMAA. All it really does is it motion blurs jagged edges of a line while differet levels of MSAA make it less &quot;jaggy.&quot; I would expect the implementation of CMAA on WoD to be some what rocky. It's new tech. Blizzard-Activation still needs to work the bugs out. If you ask me, unless they are implementing motion blur, the only gains for this is for low-level computer specs to be able to enjoy the game with everyone else. I wouldn't even use CMAA unless they refined it because the drop in performance with MSAA 8x would disappear, but in my situation, it wouldn't really matter. In the overall picture, with CMAA, ill probably see 35 FPS on Garrosh 25man instead of 30 FPS.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider. A lot of the issues in raid doesn't comes down from having a minimum spec computer, but the amount of particle effects that occur in the game. Why is this. Simply, shadows, particles, and others aren't off-loaded to the GPU. So a simple bottleneck occurs when you're doing Garrosh 25man at the CPU level, and the players with less than $2,000 &quot;invested&quot; computers are going to suck at it. Thus, they can't play the game on an equal level like those who have high-spec computers on heavy particle-fight bosses. (Particle effects + shadows) x (25 individual players + boss + surrounding background + mods + computations + textures + ...) = omg, my computer is going to explode with low specs. All rendering of models are done by the GPU, texturing, etc. Lets face it, unless AMD comes up with its own variant of PhysX or World of Warcraft implements PhysX from NVidia, you will always be at the mercy of the bottleneck with Particle Effects. What CMAA does for the low-level specs is that it gives them a slight boost in performance at whatever little portion of the game the Devs can cut out. Meaning that there is only so much performance they can be squeezed out without having to nuke the whole WoW platform, re-build it, restructure it, re-code it, etc... Implementing CMAA is that means of squeezing out performance without simply smashing it with a sledge hammer.</div></div><hr />

Problem is you cant change it with NCP and AMD Catalyst in 6.0.<br />

I've tried it on the PTR and there was absolutely no effect.</div></div><hr />
