Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
Not a loaded question, just curious, do you guys read arenajunkies forums?<br />
Sometimes. Most topics quickly degrade into namecalling. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/679559487569563648))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
lore question if you'll indulge me: Where does Elune rank in terms of power? Old God level? Titan level? Even higher?<br />
Those questions are more fun to speculate about than answer. Where do you think she falls? (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/679458248836026368))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Do you think mmo's would profit from having less numerical feedback? (eg. combatlogs and tooltips)<br />
MMOs can't generally afford sufficient combat feedback without all the numbers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678048979910656))<br />
Some fighting games have so much rich animation that it sells how you're doing with very little use of numbers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678227472764928))<br />
MMOs often have to emphasize quantity over quality, and that usually means a pretty simple basic combat model. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678390719262724))<br />
By which I mean positioning, timing and so on have to be pretty simple. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678687084597249))<br />
They dress that up with depth, usually in the form of numbers, e.g. resistances, speed, crit, dots, and so on. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/679678897588322304))<br />

Legion Alpha - Demon Hunters and Nefarian<br />
It looks like Nefarian was updated to have a Demon Hunter class call before the Alpha went down. <br />

In the other hand, it's kinda weird since most of the time you will outlevel the encount and &quot;one shot&quot; it, and how old content raids get &quot;irrelevant&quot; after their expansion is over. Time-walking raids maybe? :P (And i know they did it with all new classes they added, but it still feels weird knowing how these things work out)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be surprised if they had to add the class calls to keep the fight from breaking.</div></div><hr />

The prot paladin shield and sword looks delicious, although some of the models doesnt look like it can take more than 2 hit... :) Better suits a holy pally with all that magic flowing around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a nice nod to those who would inevitably try it out just for kicks, and you just know there would be. On that topic though, Nefarian's got a point.<br />

With all the damaging and utility spells with &quot;Hammer&quot; in the name, give the Prot Pallies the Holy &quot;Silver Hand&quot; and give the Holy ones some kind of mace.<br />

A BFHammer doesn't really seem normal to be swung around with a book in the other hand...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class CALL, not Class HALL :p. In his Original fight Neffy has &quot;Class Calls&quot; which he can use based on the classes in the raid, they've added a new one for DH's, like they did with DK and monk.<br />
<br />
p.s. Took me a second viewing to realise the screen going black was Neffy being a troll, not the person recording it positioning the camera badly *facepalm*<br />
<br />
<br />
Guys, do we really need a new artifact weapon &quot;preview&quot; every day?<br />
<br />
Yes... Yes we do. I know a lot of people, myself included, are coming back to WoW because of the Artifact system and are very interested to see the varities available for their class/spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The video going black is the class call.<br />
<br />
In the BWL fight against Nef, he forces classes to do specific things for a short period of time. All Druids are forced into cat form (for example). All Rogues are teleported directly in front of Nef (IIRC). All warriors were forced into Bezerker stance(?), including the tank.<br />
<br />
It was a way of spicing up the fight.</div></div><hr />

this post made me feel old... class calls where amazing and should make a return!!1 watching hunters go WTF b.c. their weapons broke if they didn't know better was great!!! and i'll never forget &quot;healing&quot; my main tank to death when it was a priest call... in my defense i warned the raid i was 2 drunk to raid but they didn't listen to me :P</div></div><hr />

The whole point of the Video was the Nothing, Neferian did different things to different classes during the fight. DH's got made Blind. way to make yourself look silly..</div></div><hr />

<br />
way to not know what you are talking about, Nefarian uses class calls that forces the different classes to do certain things during the encounter, in this instance the screen turning black is him forcing the demon hunter to actually be blind.</div></div><hr />
