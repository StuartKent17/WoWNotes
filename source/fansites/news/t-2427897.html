Ele looks like it's not doing that bad. (https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/19) The buffed specs were the ones that were legitimately lagging behind while the nerfed ones were the great outlyers. Elementals issue was more it's rotation feeling bad the last I recall. The post also specifies that isn't all the changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad that you are happy with your class atm, but taking a warrior tank to m+ currently is more of a burden than anything else. The difference between DK/Havoc/Pala/Monk and Warrior / Druid is just so big that it easily breaks runs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand what isn't to get. Ele shamans are consistently one of the worst classes in the game and blizzard has continually shown that they don't care. They aren't going to be competitive, ever. If you're lucky chain lightning MIGHT be strong on mass AOE for a tier. It's time to just reroll like the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

Demo locks are currently the second worst class of all, only topped by fire mage. Even the class that currently comes before them (Feral) does significantly more damage than them. I am not even sure 5% buff will really help to be honest.</div></div><hr />

Well, sure, that'd make sense, if it weren't for some key points:<br />
<br />
1) most people who have mained hunters in the past have done so enjoying the ranged playstyle of the class.<br />
<br />
2) they made survival melee, which is fine, but for the majority of hunters, not necessarily what they wanted out of their class.<br />
<br />
3) this expansion they ALSO gutted and significantly altered marksmanship, to such a degree that there is close to ZERO chance they will be competitive compared to BM until significant changes are made.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;only people who play bm are bad players&quot; argument would make sense if it wasn't the ONLY option for hunters who never wanted to play a melee. But sure, go ahead and spout your ignorance.</div></div><hr />

It's not lazy, it's by design that they do the nerfs this way. They changed a lot of the talents many years back specifically so they could 'turn the dial' in exactly this type of way when tuning.</div></div><hr />

pretty much this, BM is brain-dead but is used becasue MM is utter trash both in performance and rotation and melee survival is an abomination.</div></div><hr />

If you seriously think a 5% dps increase is going to fix feral or demo you're an absolute fool. This post sounds just like the cliche &quot;they'll fix it in alpha/beta/next patch guys&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You are assuming that everyone who is mad about BM nerfs is &quot;enjoying BM being overpowered&quot;, when it could, you know, just maybe, be because if BM is nerfed into irrelevancy they 0 options for ranged hunter specs because no amount of buffs could make MM enjoyable and good.<br />
<br />
The majority of hunters, at this point in WoW's lifespan, aren't just &quot;bm huntards&quot; of the past. In fact, I'd guess that most BM hunters at this point are just disgruntled MM hunter mains looking for a home after blizzard destroyed MM (and i mean, destroyed BM and survival as well around WOTLK-CATA).</div></div><hr />

- Reduced survability compared to last expansion<br />
- Weak in PvP both for survivability and dammage<br />
- Weak, if not non-existant for AOE damage<br />
- Good for single target, although not at the top compared to some other classes which are also good at AOE<br />
<br />
And the response of Blizzard is : I'm going to reduce your ST dps ...<br />
So : I'm not going to do Pvp, I'm not going to do MM+ because not competitive, I'll stay afk during aoe packs in raid, I'll try to do my best on ST only (without any conviction ...).<br />
Of course I'll try destru and demo ... but too bad, they are even worse than affli on the dps side !<br />

Half the stuff you're talking about seems to be aimed at PvP I guess? It's either that or your sense of which specs are good in PvE is a bit off on some specs/classes. Anyways you do realise that although these changes affect PvP that they're not ment for PvP right? This is for PvE balance, the changes ment for PvP nowadays no longer affect PvE so there won't be a overall nerf for the sake of PvP. PvP changes always go with a tag above that says Player versus Player.<br />
<br />
The PvP hotfixes can be seen in the other hotfix notes. And quite a bit of the stuff you're talking about is already nerfed quite a bit so I'm not really sure what you're talking about. https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/39514-big-pvp-hotfixes-september-6th/ there you can read up on the first set of changes, the BM hunter(MM isn't really great in PvP nor PvE so I'm not sure why you're talking about MM) and warrior nerfs are at the top of mmo-champion.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not satisfied by the changes made since underperforming classes haven't been buffed and the fact that they don't role out all the changes at the same but it is what it is.</div></div><hr />

That's normal for Shadow tho. They are usually completely garbage on release and then turn out a bit sub par after 2 or 3 consecutive buffs. I don't know who is responsible for Shadows but whoever it is screwed up ever since BC. They are always bad in leveling, always bad in farming, always bad in open PvP, always bad in instances...and usually mediocre to somewhat above average in large scale PvP and raids.

That's pretty accurate. I love my elemental shaman, and I've been playing him since launch, but goddamn it's not even fun anymore. Combat is boring as hell, and my spells hit like a soggy pancake.

Yeah it's normal, but it's frustrating. It's absurd that Fire Mages, and Shadow Priest are always crap - outside of that one brief moment Fire got to shine before it was quickly nerfed so the pet favorites Frost and Arcane could go back to dominating.<br />
<br />
Sick of the top casters ALWAYS being Frost/Arcane Mages.<br />
Tired of top ranged ALWAYS being Mages (Frost and/or Arcane) and Hunters!<br />
<br />
Boomys exist. Spriest exist. Elemental Shamans exist!!! FFS, yes Boomys got to be strong in Mythic+ at the end of Legion, but it's silly to act like they've been strong and viable for years, they were strong for a brief moment and now they're bottom of the list. Mages, when is the last time a Frost mage has been pure crap for a real extended period of time? When is the last time both Frost and Arcane have been trash(LOL - never), when is the last time Hunters haven't been viable af!?!? Like come on Blizz, this isn't fair!!!</div></div><hr />

They received an AoE buff about two weeks ago. Still one of the worst AoE specs. A reshuffle to damage/energy regen last week, was DPS neutral for the most part. Now a flat 5% buff. Which will do relatively nothing, even being coupled with some Rogue nerfs. They’re still well under power compared to every melee DPS, particularly leather DPS, despite having the worst AoE of any melee spec and the most annoying to pull of rotation.</div></div><hr />

PvP doesnt matter in the slightest. Its like balancing the entire game around pet battles. Nope. Disc was incredibly OP and needed a nerf. The holy nerf i dont really get as much tho</div></div><hr />

Greatttt, now we'll be even WORSE in comparison to everyone else....<br />

Yeah it's normal, but it's frustrating. It's absurd that Fire Mages, and Shadow Priest are always crap - outside of that one brief moment Fire got to shine before it was quickly nerfed so the pet favorites Frost and Arcane could go back to dominating.<br />
<br />
Sick of the top casters ALWAYS being Frost/Arcane Mages.<br />
Tired of top ranged ALWAYS being Mages (Frost and/or Arcane) and Hunters!<br />
<br />
Boomys exist. Spriest exist. Elemental Shamans exist!!! FFS, yes Boomys got to be strong in Mythic+ at the end of Legion, but it's silly to act like they've been strong and viable for years, they were strong for a brief moment and now they're bottom of the list. Mages, when is the last time a Frost mage has been pure crap for a real extended period of time? When is the last time both Frost and Arcane have been trash(LOL - never), when is the last time Hunters haven't been viable af!?!? Like come on Blizz, this isn't fair!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Crazy how things have changed. I remember classic to early Cata Frost was a PvP only spec, and only remotely viable if you were a master of the specialization. Now I come back after an expac and it's top dog!</div></div><hr />

Apparently you're not playing with very good Disc priests, or are not one. They do quite a lot of damage prevention, have a lot of utility, and a lot of great CDs, and do really great healing. They do it all, without a real weakness, compared to say.. Mistweavers, who do a ton of healing throughput, but have no cooldowns or raid utility, or Resto Shamans, who do a ton of healing when stacked only, but also bring a ton of utility and CDs.<br />
<br />
If they were just fine in PvE, they wouldn't have nerfed them in PvE, they would have just nerfed them in PvP. They did a lot of damage, and damage = healing, too, which made them amazing in M+<br />
<br />
For everyone complaining about Ele, I guess my question is, why haven't you picked up a new favorite class/spec, since every single expansion they get shit on? They're garbage now, they were garbage then, and they will always be garbage.</div></div><hr />

OK, I can buy that he hits too much in pvp. But because pvp you should not nerf on such savage way the pve. <br />
Disciplines are not op on pve healing. The crazy 9% nerf to smite damage not just decrease his damage, also decrease a lot his healing. And, repeat, his healing is not op at all. A good number of other healers beat them.<br />
<br />
And discipline priest is harder to use since no really &quot;panic buttons&quot;. Also the utility discipline provides is the damage... They don't have true ccs, not provide mana, no ress in combat, not inmunnity...</div></div><hr />

You need to play better if you don't think is near top. Disc requires a finite &quot;rotation&quot; of sorts to sustain good play in raids. <br />
<br />
If you want I teach a class on disc priest raid play for a small nominal fee. Hit me up.</div></div><hr />

Disc priest almost outdps my warrior in arena and you think 9% on Smite will change a thing ? <br />
Like on WOD you screw up things badly with reflecting shield now you make even worse letting disc priest do insane dmg. What is this class role dps or heal ? Just open your eyes and see whats going on in arena 90% of the arenas are against disc/rogue , disc/bm hunter. That does not give you a sign that something is wrong with the game , and that the wow community its just desperate to play something op ?</div></div><hr />

Disc is pretty OP in the healing department if you know what you're doing, if you don't know what you're doing then yea it seems like they suck, but really they are in a great spot, better than Holy in some places. As much as I hate the neft I understand why they did it. I just wish they would do more for Shadow since I'm fully enchanted and buffed and I'm barely doing as much DPS as the Frost mage that has almost no enchants and worse gear, that is problematic.</div></div><hr />

Holy was miles ahead of disc on every fight aside from g'huun, and one fight is not a reason to nerf. MW is ahead on Taloc, where's their nerf for one fight?<br />

&quot;Shadow- ALL DAMAGE increased by 20%.&quot;<br />
This spec is almost DEAD LAST AGAIN, and will quickly become outpaced by all the other classes if something isn't done. The first week of logs were absolutely abysmal for shadow..... If they refuse to rework the spec to fix all the broken shit at least make said broken shit do more damage so we aren't left behind and sat out of raids</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard said at the start of Legion they were making efforts to not make the pendulum swing as far in balancing classes.<br />
<br />
I much prefer small nerfs/buffs that dial classes in vs. the old habit of destroying OP classes and making OP ones out of broken classes. Not to say Blizzard has been perfect at this either, but they are on the right track and are pursuing a much better plan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Asking for massive number changes just sounds like trying to get the game unrealistically catered to yourself.</div></div><hr />
