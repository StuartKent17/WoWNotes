<br />
Thandol span on the right, the gap between upper and lower EK. You're seeing Dun Morough to the south, Gilneas on the left (as a pseudo-island / peninsula), and greater Lordaeron on the top (including Arathi, Hillsbrad, etc; later Plaguelands). Water in the upper right corner is Darrowmere Lake, and Lordamere Lake to the left. The location the camera drops is completely irrelevant to much of the First War, since the Dark Portal was in the Black Morass / Blasted Lands.<br />

<br />
** NOTE: This area is relevant to the SECOND War. The movie is about the FIRST war, and as a result, really only involves Blasted Lands, Swamp of Sorrows, Redridge, Elwynn, Darkshire, Westfall, Deadwind Pass / Karazahn, and kinda-sorta-maybe Burning Steppes / Searing Gorge / Dun Morough (since there is an &quot;Orcs in the Snow&quot; shot, Ironforge, and I assume Blackrock Mountain will be at least briefly mentioned) -- Almost NONE of which are visible in that shot of EK.</div></div><hr />

if you are referring at the top-bottom view of Azeroth, the region filmed is Baradin Bay.<br />

If you bought it the other day WoD wasn't part of it. So you may be in a grey area on that purchase. It's quite possible a call to blizzard would get you a boost considering that account would still be in it's free 30 day status.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you watch the featurette, you see Azeroth from even further out (enough to see the Maelstrom). The area shown is Baradin Bay, the body of water between Dun Morogh and Hillsbrad. Strangely, it appears to be zooming in toward the area where Zul'dare or Kul'Tiras would be. Can't tell with all the cloud cover, though I believe the island south of the clouds is actually Kul'Tiras. Early maps put the Tomb of Sargeras in that area, which would fit with the story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must be referring to Garona, the half-orc female. Not green body paint btw... She was colored green with cgi<br />
<br />
There are plenty of examples of full orc females in the clips released so far... but i'll give you an example:<br />

Don't know why I'm bothering to correct someone so obviously ignorant, but:<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard didn't make the movie.<br />
2. Garona is a half orc.<br />
3. The actual orc females are all CGI mocap.<br />
4. Based on bts footage, Garona's skin color was changed digitally in post-production.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back in MoP, the level 90 boost was introduced to help players joining for the new expansion (WoD) would be able to jump right in to play the expac they just bought. Now that WoD is part of the basic game, this is replaced by the level 100 boost, so you can jump in right to playing Legion. There's no need for a level 90 boost any more, like there's no need for a level 80 one, it doesn't bring you to current (levelling) content any more.<br />
<br />
If you buy the &quot;brown box&quot;, you don't get a boost. <br />
Accounts upgraded to WoD for free don't get a boost. <br />
However if you purchased a WoD key recently, that item explicitly comes with a level 90 boost so they will honor that and give a boost to someone with a WoD key currently. That's for WoD keys, not the new brown box base game. <br />
Also, if you do have a WoD key right now, you can't use it! Because WoD is free, no longer for sale, the keys no longer work. So you would need to talk to a GM to use it - which you can do here https://battle.net/support/en/case/</div></div><hr />

The area shown is Baradin Bay, the body of water between Dun Morogh and Hillsbrad. Strangely, it appears to be zooming in toward the area where Zul'dare or Kul'Tiras would be. Can't tell with all the cloud cover, though I believe the island south of the clouds is actually Kul'Tiras. Early maps put the Tomb of Sargeras in that area, which would fit with the story.<br />
<br />
Dalaran used to be there, in Hillsbrad, yes? But in the movie they made it so that it is flying even though it shouldn't yet. So Dalaran could probably be flying there, just a bit south of Hillsbrad, which would make a lot of sense i believe.</div></div><hr />

Actually, as we've yet to see how Draenor is really introduced, I think they might show some Draenei villages or something. Garona might tell the humans that she is half Orc, and half Human, but later in the story I suspect it might be revealed that she is actually half Draenei.</div></div><hr />

Alright sorry, I know she's half draenei, but in the movie she's depicted as half human. She also believes she is, and she does look more human than draenei. But there is the role of the draenei mother, played by Elena Wurlitzer, and that might be Garonas actual mother.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do believe that's a felhunter!</div></div><hr />

<br />
GOD DAMN IT ! She's an half orc HALF DRAENEI !<br />
<br />
How could she be a half human since THEY JUST MET THE HUMAN FOR THE FIRST TIME RIGHT HERE.<br />
<br />
She was the niece of Maraad and the mother of Med'an (the son of Medivh) an half human quater orc quater draenei.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laylriana</div><div class="date">2016-05-19, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's Alodi right? People seem to be saying that even though Alodi is a male character.......If this is true, why would they change the gender? Since they're dedicating an artifact to Alodi you think they'd get the gender right??<br />
<br />
It is Aegwyn. According to lore in Wowpedia: <br />
<br />
As he died in battle before her, Sargeras had spirited his essence into Aegwynn's own body like a cancer, lying in wait for her to conceive as he knew she would. Sargeras later stitched himself into the fabric of Medivh's unborn body so that when he awoke and realized the power of Tirisfal he would also manifest his unholy, demonic heritage. Somehow unable to kill Aegwynn, Medivh instead banished her from his sight.<br />
<br />
In a desperate attempt to spread word of Medivh’s evil, Aegwynn had an audience with King Llane. She warned him that Medivh was behind the orcish invasion and that he would eventually have to be dealt with. Llane listened gratefully. (This may have been retconned in The Last Guardian, where it was Khadgar and Garona Halforcen who revealed Medivh's treachery)</div></div><hr />

Also looks like a picture of Draenor from orbit at the bottom...and some part of Azeroth closer to the top. Anyone know what bit of the EK that could be?<br />
<br />
Why would they literally give you even more, for less lol.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm sure it will be on sale soon anyways so yeah</div></div><hr />

If something let a dog do his business on the face of the Mona Lisa, it would lower the quality and likely the price of the masterpiece.<br />
